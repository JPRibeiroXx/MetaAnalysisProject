{"title": "Numerical Analysis of Microchannels Designed for Heat Sinks.", "abstract": "Conjugate heat transfer is numerically investigated using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics approach in various microchannel geometries to identify a high-performance cooling method for piezoelectric ceramic stacks and spindle units in high-precision machines. Straight microchannels with rectangular cross sections are first considered, showing the performance limitations of decreasing the size of the microchannels, so other solutions are needed for high applied heat fluxes. Next, many microchannel designs, focusing on streamwise geometric variation, are compared to straight channels to assess their performances. Sinusoidally varying channels produce the highest heat transfer rates of those studied. Thus, their optimization is considered at a channel width and height of 35 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. Heat transfer increases as the amplitude and spatial frequencies of the channels increase due to increased interfacial surface area and enhanced Dean flow. The highest performance efficiencies are observed at intermediate levels of amplitude and frequency, with efficiency decreasing as these geometric parameters are increased further at the onset of flow separation. The sinusoidal channel geometries are then optimized with respect to minimizing the system's pressure drop for all applied heat fluxes between 5690 and 6510\u00a0kW/m", "journal": "Nanomanufacturing and metrology", "date": "2022-12-27", "authors": ["MatthewMcCormack", "FengzhouFang", "JufanZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s41871-021-00118-2\n10.1109/EDL.1981.25367\n10.1016/j.rser.2013.01.022\n10.1109/TCAPT.2005.853170\n10.1109/TCAPT.2008.916791\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2011.01.029\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.03.010\n10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2006.01.011\n10.1115/1.4002169\n10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2014.01.015\n10.1115/1.4046342\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.03.045\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.06.036\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.02.075\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.08.086\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.04.005\n10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2015.05.009\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2010.02.022\n10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2010.09.012\n10.1115/1.4003284\n10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2125963\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.02.069\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.06.015\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2011.02.030\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.10.018\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.07.165\n10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2019.03.036\n10.1007/s41871-020-00068-1\n10.1007/s41871-019-00053-3\n10.1016/j.cirp.2017.05.004\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.01.025\n10.1016/j.energy.2016.01.102"}
{"title": "Triple-modality co-registered endoscope featuring wide-field reflectance imaging, and high-resolution multiphoton and optical coherence microscopy.", "abstract": "We present the design and feasibility testing of a multimodal co-registered endoscope based on a dual-path optical system integrated with a scanning piezo. This endoscope incorporates three different imaging modalities. A large field of view reflectance imaging system enables visualization of objects several millimeters in front of the endoscope, while optical coherence microscopy and multiphoton microscopy are employed in contact with tissue to further analyze suspicious areas. The optical system allows multiple different imaging modalities by employing a dual optical path. One path features a low numerical aperture and wide field of view to allow reflectance imaging of distant objects. The other path features a high numerical aperture and short working distance to allow microscopy techniques such as optical coherence microscopy and multiphoton microscopy. Images of test targets were obtained with each imaging modality to verify and characterize the imaging capabilities of the endoscope. The reflectance modality was demonstrated with a 561 nm laser to allow high contrast with blood vessels. It achieved a lateral resolution of 24.8 \u03bcm at 5 mm and a working distance from 5 mm to 30 mm. Optical coherence microscopy (OCM) was performed with a 1300 nm super-luminescent diode since this wavelength experiences low relative scattering to allow for deeper tissue imaging. Measured OCM lateral and axial resolution was 4.0 \u03bcm and 14.2 \u03bcm, respectively. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was performed with a custom 1400 nm femtosecond fiber laser, a wavelength suitable for exciting multiple exogenous and some endogenous fluorophores, as well as providing information on tissue composition through harmonic generation processes.

Here, we describe how scanning probe techniques have been enhanced by some of these recent algorithmic improvements. One improvement to the data acquisition algorithm is to advance beyond a simple rastering framework by using spirals at constant angular velocity then switching to constant linear velocity, which limits the piezo creep and hysteresis issues seen in traditional acquisition methods. One can also use image-processing techniques to model the distortions that appear from tip motion effects and to make corrections to these images. Another image-processing algorithm we discuss enables researchers to segment images by domains and subdomains, thereby highlighting reactive and interesting disordered sites at domain boundaries. Lastly, we discuss algorithms used to examine the dipole direction of individual molecules and surface domains, hydrogen bonding interactions, and molecular tilt. The computational algorithms used for scanning probe techniques are still improving rapidly and are incorporating machine learning at the next level of iteration. That said, the algorithms are not yet able to perform live adjustments during data recording that could enhance the microscopy and spectroscopic imaging methods significantly.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

With dimensions of ~100-200 \u03bcm across and <1 \u03bcm thick, they offer high spatial resolution, portability, low power consumption, and low cost. However, a thorough understanding of the magnetic material behavior in these devices has been lacking, hindering performance optimization. This manuscript reports on the strong, nonlinear correlation observed between the frequency response of these sensors and the stress-induced curvature of the resonator plate. The resonance frequency shift caused by DC magnetic fields drops off rapidly with increasing curvature: about two orders of magnitude separate the highest and lowest frequency shift in otherwise identical devices. Similarly, an inverse correlation with the quality factor was found, suggesting a magnetic loss mechanism. The mechanical and magnetic properties are theoretically analyzed using magnetoelastic finite-element and magnetic domain-phase models. The resulting model fits the measurements well and is generally consistent with additional results from magneto-optical domain imaging. Thus, the origin of the observed behavior is identified and broader implications for the design of nano-magnetoelastic devices are derived.

Piezo-polymerization is a novel approach that harnesses vibrational mechanical energy through piezoelectric nanoparticles to generate chemical promoters for linear polymerization and cross-linking reactions. However, the available piezo-polymerization systems rely on reactions forming irreversible covalent bonds. Dynamic covalent linkages could impart further adaptability to these polymeric systems. Here we show the first example of the piezoelectrochemical synthesis of disulfide bonds to form organogels from polymers with thiol side groups. We demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via piezo-oxidation of the thiol to disulfide in the presence of ZnO nanoparticles and iodide anions under mechanical agitation. We use mechanical energy in the form of ultrasound (40 kHz) and low frequency vibrations (2 kHz) to synthesize a variety of organogels from common synthetic polymers. Additionally, we show that the polymers in these gels can be chemically recycled with a reducing agent. Finally, we study the thermal and mechanical properties of the composites obtained after drying the gels.

With the synergistic effect of the dehydrofluorination reaction and applied high voltage electric field, the piezoelectric and energy storage properties of fibrous membranes attained great improvement. It was found that the simultaneous introduction of conjugated double bonds to the backbone of PVDF which was accompanied with the elimination of HF, resulted in the decrease of its molecular weight, solution viscosity and hydrophobicity. The crystalline phase, diameter, piezoelectric and energy storage properties of electro-spun PVDF nanofiber membranes significantly depend on the degree of HF elimination in dehydrofluorinated PVDF.

{"title": "Fluorescent films based on PVDF doped with carbon dots for evaluation of UVA protection of sunscreens and fabrication of cool white LEDs.", "abstract": "The ultraviolet-A (UVA) radiation from sunlight that reaches the earth's surface can induce premature aging, immunosuppression, and skin cancer. Commercial sunscreen products offer limited information regarding protection against UVA light. Therefore, proposing new and practical alternatives to evaluate the UVA protection capacity of commercial sunscreens is highly imperative. This work presents a novel methodology for evaluating the quality of sunscreens using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based films doped with plant derived photoluminescent carbon dots (CDs). The bluish white light emitting (under UVA exposure) PVDF/CD films were used to evaluate the UVA protection capacity of 8 different commercial sunscreens. The evaluation of UVA protection is based on the fluorescence attenuation observed with the films coated with sunscreens. In addition, visual evaluation of the UVA protection capacity of the sunscreens and commercial glasses, using the same films and a commercial UV lamp at 365 nm, has also been demonstrated. Two sunscreens with limited UVA protection were identified using the proposed simple evaluation mechanisms without conventionally used expensive instruments and complex methodologies. Additionally, the capacity of PVDF/CD material has been explored for the possible fabrication of WLEDs with cool light emission.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2022-05-03", "authors": ["DanielHern\u00e1ndez-Rivera", "Simei DarinelTorres-Landa", "MiriamRangel-Ayala", "VivechanaAgarwal"], "doi": "10.1039/d1ra04746a"}

{"title": "A strategy for preparing controllable, superhydrophobic, strongly sticky surfaces using SiO", "abstract": "In nature, wetting by water droplets on superhydrophobic materials is governed by the Cassie-Baxter or Wenzel models. Moreover, sticky properties, derived from these types of wettings, are required for a wide range of applications involving superhydrophobic materials. As a facile new strategy, a method employing a gaseous fluorine precursor to fabricate core-shell particles, comprising perfectly shaped fluorine shells with adjustable adhesive strength, is described in this paper. Silica was used as the hydrophilic core, while polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used for the hydrophobic shell coating, forming a raspberry-like shape. In addition, controlling the amount of PVDF coated on the silica surface enabled the water droplets to come into contact with both the PVDF of the shell and the silica of the core, thereby controlling both the superhydrophobicity and the adhesive strength. Thus, the synthesized particles formed a structured coating with controllable stickiness and contact angles of 131-165\u00b0. Furthermore, on surfaces with high adhesivity, the water droplets remained stable at tilt angles of 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 even under a strong centrifugal force, whereas on surfaces with low adhesivity, the water droplets slid off when the substrate was tilted at 4\u00b0.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2022-04-29", "authors": ["Seung-HyunKim", "Hong SukKang", "Eun-HoSohn", "Bong-JunChang", "In JunPark", "Sang GooLee"], "doi": "10.1039/d1ra03928h"}

In this study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSs) were respectively used as adhesives and lignin-nanocellulose crystal (L-CNC) particles as main structure materials to prepare L-CNC coated superhydrophobic meshes. Moreover, the meshes coated with L-CNC/PVDF and L-CNC/PDMS were compared with respect to the properties of wettability, sandpaper abrasion, oil-water separation, ", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2022-04-16", "authors": ["JingdaHuang", "MengmengLi", "YouweiLu", "ChangyingRen", "SiqunWang", "QiangWu", "QianLi", "WenbiaoZhang", "XianmiaoLiu"], "doi": "10.1039/d1ra02291a\n10.1098/rsta.2019.0121\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.05.077\n10.1016/j.cis.2018.03.009\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2019.105453\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2019.04.069\n10.1039/C7NJ01265A\n10.1021/acsomega.9b04067\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.11.044\n10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.018\n10.1007/s10570-017-1420-9\n10.1021/acsami.7b13182\n10.1039/C7RA08578H\n10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.079\n10.1007/s10570-018-1748-9\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.11.059\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.12.017\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.04.019\n10.1007/s10311-019-00952-3\n10.1021/la301479c\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.177\n10.1016/j.jcis.2018.10.045\n10.3390/ma10091080\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.05.125\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b03908\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.03.114\n10.1021/am400132p\n10.1039/C5TA02780B\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.05.043\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.06.086\n10.1016/j.cej.2017.07.114\n10.1007/s00339-015-9525-1\n10.1016/j.jcis.2011.04.004\n10.1039/C6CC04609F\n10.1039/C4TA02181A\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.015\n10.1039/C5RA08478D"}

This paper summarizes different techniques that have been used to mimic this elegant physiological transport mechanism that is commonly found in nature. The analysis provides definitions of peristaltic micropumps and their different features, distinguishing them from other mechanical micropumps. Important parameters in peristalsis are presented, such as the operating frequency, stroke volume, and various actuation sequences, along with introducing design rules and analysis for optimizing actuation sequences. Actuation methods such as piezoelectric, motor, pneumatic, electrostatic, and thermal are discussed with their advantages and disadvantages for application in peristaltic micropumps.

{"title": "Quantification of assembly forces during creation of head-neck taper junction considering soft tissue bearing: a biomechanical study.", "abstract": "All current total hip arthroplasty (THA) systems are modular in design. Only during the operation femoral head and stem get connected by a Morse taper junction. The junction is realized by hammer blows from the surgeon. Decisive for the junction strength is the maximum force acting once in the direction of the neck axis, which is mainly influenced by the applied impulse and surrounding soft tissues. This leads to large differences in assembly forces between the surgeries. This study aimed to quantify the assembly forces of different surgeons under influence of surrounding soft tissue.\nFirst, a measuring system, consisting of a prosthesis and a hammer, was developed. Both components are equipped with a piezoelectric force sensor. Initially, in situ experiments on human cadavers were carried out using this system in order to determine the actual assembly forces and to characterize the influence of human soft tissues. Afterwards, an in vitro model in the form of an artificial femur (Sawbones Europe AB, Malmo, Sweden) with implanted measuring stem embedded in gelatine was developed. The gelatine mixture was chosen in such a way that assembly forces applied to the model corresponded to those in situ. A study involving 31 surgeons was carried out on the aforementioned in vitro model, in which the assembly forces were determined.\nA model was developed, with the influence of human soft tissues being taken into account. The assembly forces measured on the in vitro model were, on average, 2037.2\u00a0N\u2009\u00b1\u2009724.9\u00a0N, ranging from 822.5\u00a0N to 3835.2\u00a0N. The comparison among the surgeons showed no significant differences in sex (P\u2009=\u20090.09), work experience (P\u2009=\u20090.71) and number of THAs performed per year (P\u2009=\u20090.69).\nAll measured assembly forces were below 4 kN, which is recommended in the literature. This could lead to increased corrosion following fretting in the head-neck interface. In addition, there was a very wide range of assembly forces among the surgeons, although other influencing factors such as different implant sizes or materials were not taken into account. To ensure optimal assembly force, the impaction should be standardized, e.g., by using an appropriate surgical instrument.", "journal": "Arthroplasty (London, England)", "date": "2022-03-04", "authors": ["ToniWendler", "TorstenPrietzel", "RobertM\u00f6bius", "Jean-PierreFischer", "AndreasRoth", "DirkZajonz"], "doi": "10.1186/s42836-021-00075-7\n10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60457-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0167911\n10.1016/j.arth.2017.02.046\n10.2106/JBJS.RVW.16.00002\n10.1002/jor.22326\n10.1302/2046-3758.14.2000047\n10.1007/s11420-016-9526-4\n10.1302/0301-620X.98B5.35592\n10.1053/j.sart.2014.01.002\n10.1177/112070001002000202\n10.1007/s11999-012-2502-5\n10.1007/s11999-013-3096-2\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2011.08.002\n10.3390/met9040422\n10.1016/j.arth.2016.11.054\n10.1515/BMT.2006.018\n10.1002/bjs.1800239213\n10.2106/00004623-199701000-00013\n10.5435/JAAOS-D-15-00111\n10.1002/jor.23601\n10.5301/HIP.2011.8408\n10.1177/0954411916644477\n10.1302/2046-3758.72.BJR-2017-0078.R2\n10.1177/0954411916648717\n10.3390/ma13081950"}
{"title": "Advances in Inorganic Nanomaterials for Triboelectric Nanogenerators.", "abstract": "Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that utilize triboelectrification and electrostatic induction to convert mechanical energy to electricity have attracted increasing interest in the last 10 years. As a universal physical phenomenon, triboelectrification can occur between any two surfaces that experience physical contact and separation regardless of the type of material. For this reason, many materials, including both organic and inorganic materials, have been studied in TENGs with different purposes. Although organic polymers are mainly used as triboelectric materials in TENGs, the application of inorganic nanomaterials has also been intensively studied because of their unique dielectric, electric, piezoelectric, and optical properties, which can improve the performance of TENGs. A review of how inorganic nanomaterials are used in TENGs would help researchers gain an overview of the progress in this area.

{"title": "Elastic waves in particulate glass-rubber mixtures.", "abstract": "We investigate the propagation of waves in dense static granular packings made of soft and stiff particles subjected to hydrostatic stress. Physical experiments in a triaxial cell equipped with broadband piezoelectric wave transducers have been performed at ultrasound frequencies. The time of flight is measured in order to study the combined effect of applied stress and rubber content on the elastic properties of the mixtures. The bulk stiffness deduced from the wave speed is nonlinear and non-monotonic with the increasing percentage of rubber with a more prominent effect at higher pressures.

{"title": "Ion Channels in Biophysics and Physiology: Methods & Challenges to Study Mechanosensitive Ion Channels.", "abstract": "In a seminal work published in 1950, Sir B. Katz showed that the electrical response of the frog muscle spindle varies directly with the rate and amplitude of muscle stretch. This observation led him to propose the existence of a piezoelectric substance in this organ, setting the stage for the field of mechanobiology (Katz, J Physiol 111, 261-282, 1950). Despite this early work, the identity of the molecules responsible for the conversion of mechanical stimuli into biological signals has remained hidden for decades. This delay is often attributed to the inherent difficulty to precisely quantify the mechanical deformations of biological samples. In contrast to other forms of stimuli such as ligand concentration and membrane potential, quantifying mechanical deformations of cell membranes is not trivial. Mechanical forces produce a complex array of membrane deformations including bending, thinning, compression, expansion, and shear, and thus, have components in many strain dimensions. In addition, due to the viscoelastic nature of cells, these deformations may have linear and nonlinear components. In spite of these experimental challenges, Sukharev et al. cloned the first mechanosensitive ion channel from the bacteria E. coli in the mid-1990s (Sukharev et al. Nature, 265-268, 1994). Two decades later, several protein families encompassing dozens of eukaryotic mechanosensitive ion channels have been identified, depicting an astonishing diversity of force-activated molecular machines. In this chapter, we intend to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge and technical challenges to study how cell membranes deform upon mechanical stress and how ion channel proteins detect these deformations to engage homeostatic cellular responses.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2022-02-10", "authors": ["Yun LynaLuo", "JeromeLacroix"], "doi": "10.1007/978-981-16-4254-8_3\n10.1113/jphysiol.1950.sp004479\n10.1038/368265a0\n10.1021/nl5047335\n10.1021/nl4005145\n10.1038/s42003-019-0514-3\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.076\n10.1152/ajpcell.00148.2016\n10.1073/pnas.0607224103\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76237-6\n10.1085/jgp.200509394\n10.1529/biophysj.106.092478\n10.1080/19336950.2016.1224624\n10.1038/nsb827\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.075\n10.1007/s12551-018-0450-3\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.7554/eLife.41845\n10.7554/eLife.41844\n10.1016/j.neuron.2011.06.038\n10.7554/eLife.38461\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.031\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.024\n10.1007/s12195-014-0337-8\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.02.016\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7362-0_11\n10.1093/emboj/17.15.4283\n10.1038/s41467-018-04405-3\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.033\n10.4161/chan.21064\n10.1242/jcs.226076\n10.1038/s41598-018-32572-2\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1016/s0092-8674(00)00143-4\n10.1038/35036318\n10.1074/jbc.M302517200\n10.1074/jbc.M109.020206\n10.2174/18744672112059990027\n10.1152/ajprenal.2001.280.6.F1010\n10.1074/jbc.M311783200\n10.1529/biophysj.107.119966\n10.1038/nsb828\n10.1038/nature14013\n10.1038/s41586-019-1505-8\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1038/s41467-019-12501-1\n10.1038/s41586-019-1499-2\n10.1111/febs.14711\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.09.004\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2016.11.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.049\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1038/ncomms4520\n10.1063/1.479313\n10.1016/j.bpj.2018.12.016\n10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.07.014\n10.1039/c7cp01921a\n10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00716"}

{"title": "Tactile Sensing for Minimally Invasive Surgery: Conventional Methods and Potential Emerging Tactile Technologies.", "abstract": "As opposed to open surgery procedures, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) utilizes small skin incisions to insert a camera and surgical instruments. MIS has numerous advantages such as reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery time, and reduced learning curve for surgical trainees. MIS comprises surgical approaches, including laparoscopic surgery, endoscopic surgery, and robotic-assisted surgery. Despite the advantages that MIS provides to patients and surgeons, it remains limited by the lost sense of touch due to the indirect contact with tissues under operation, especially in robotic-assisted surgery. Surgeons, without haptic feedback, could unintentionally apply excessive forces that may cause tissue damage. Therefore, incorporating tactile sensation into MIS tools has become an interesting research topic. Designing, fabricating, and integrating force sensors onto different locations on the surgical tools are currently under development by several companies and research groups. In this context, electrical force sensing modality, including piezoelectric, resistive, and capacitive sensors, is the most conventionally considered approach to measure the grasping force, manipulation force, torque, and tissue compliance. For instance, piezoelectric sensors exhibit high sensitivity and accuracy, but the drawbacks of thermal sensitivity and the inability to detect static loads constrain their adoption in MIS tools. Optical-based tactile sensing is another conventional approach that facilitates electrically passive force sensing compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. Estimations of applied loadings are calculated from the induced changes in the intensity, wavelength, or phase of light transmitted through optical fibers. Nonetheless, new emerging technologies are also evoking a high potential of contributions to the field of smart surgical tools. The recent development of flexible, highly sensitive tactile microfluidic-based sensors has become an emerging field in tactile sensing, which contributed to wearable electronics and smart-skin applications. Another emerging technology is imaging-based tactile sensing that achieved superior multi-axial force measurements by implementing image sensors with high pixel densities and frame rates to track visual changes on a sensing surface. This article aims to review the literature on MIS tactile sensing technologies in terms of working principles, design requirements, and specifications. Moreover, this work highlights and discusses the promising potential of a few emerging technologies towards establishing low-cost, high-performance MIS force sensing.", "journal": "Frontiers in

{"title": "Functional Expression of Transient Receptor Potential and Piezo1 Channels in Cultured Interstitial Cells of Human-Bladder Lamina Propria.", "abstract": "The interstitial cells in bladder lamina propria (LP-ICs) are believed to be involved in sensing/afferent signaling in bladder mucosa. Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels act as mechano- or chemo-sensors and may underlie some of the sensing function of bladder LP-ICs. We aimed to investigate the molecular and functional expression of TRP channels implicated in bladder sensory function and Piezo1/Piezo2 channels in cultured LP-ICs of the human bladder. Bladder tissues were obtained from patients undergoing cystectomy. LP-ICs were isolated and cultured, and used for real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and calcium-imaging experiments. At the mRNA level, TRPA1, TRPV2, and Piezo1 were expressed most abundantly. Immunocytochemical staining showed protein expression of TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPM8, as well as Piezo1 and Piezo2. Calcium imaging using channel agonists/antagonists provided evidence for functional expression of TRPA1, TRPV2, TRPV4, Piezo1, but not of TRPV1 or TRPM8. Activation of these channels with their agonist resulted in release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from LP-ICs.

{"title": "Rate-Dependent Modeling of Piezoelectric Actuators for Nano Manipulation Based on Fractional Hammerstein Model.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators (PEAs), as a smart material with excellent characteristics, are increasingly used in high-precision and high-speed nano-positioning systems. Different from the usual positioning control or fixed frequency tracking control, the more accurate rate-dependent PEA nonlinear model is needed in random signal dynamic tracking control systems such as active vibration control. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a Hammerstein model based on fractional order rate correlation. The improved Bouc-Wen model is used to describe the asymmetric hysteresis characteristics of PEA, and the fractional order model is used to describe the dynamic characteristics of PEA. The nonlinear rate-dependent hysteresis model can be used to accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of PEA. Compared with the integer order model or linear autoregressive model to describe the dynamic characteristics of the PEA Hammerstein model, the modeling accuracy is higher. Moreover, an artificial bee colony algorithm (DE-ABC) based on differential evolution was proposed to identify model parameters. By adding the mutation strategy and chaos search of the genetic algorithm into the previous ABC, the convergence speed of the algorithm is faster and the identification accuracy is higher, and the simultaneous identification of order and coefficient of the fractional model is realized. Finally, by comparing the simulation and experimental data of multiple sets of sinusoidal excitation with different frequencies, the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method and the accuracy and rapidity of the identification algorithm are verified. The results show that, in the wide frequency range of 1-100 Hz, the proposed method can obtain more accurate rate-correlation models than the Bouc-Wen model, the Hammerstein model based on integer order or the linear autoregressive model to describe dynamic characteristics. The maximum error (Max error) is 0.0915 \u03bcm, and the maximum mean square error (RMSE) is 0.0244.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2022-01-22", "authors": ["LiuYang", "ZhongyangZhao", "YiZhang", "DongjieLi"], "doi": "10.3390/mi13010042\n10.1109/TIE.2015.2414396\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.11.027\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.11.035\n10.1117/12.973648\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/055032\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2739745\n10.1007/s10439-016-1585-7\n10.5194/ms-6-95-2015\n10.1049/el.2015.3138\n10.1109/TAC.2007.892369\n10.1063/1.2193068\n10.1016/S0020-7683(00)00055-X\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2005.08.008\n10.1021/jp105262h\n10.1039/C6RA22673F\n10.1109/aim.2017.8014237\n10.1109/TMECH.2015.2465868\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.11.023\n10.1109/TIE.2011.2166235\n10.1007/s11633-014-0765-x\n10.1155/2013/814919\n10.1177/0959651820934351\n10.1109/ccdc.2012.6244223\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.09.043\n10.1504/IJMIC.2009.024325\n10.1002/aic.690370211\n10.7641/CTA.2014.30478\n10.1061/JMCEA3.0002106\n10.1016/j.neucom.2018.08.007\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.115905\n10.1109/TCST.2019.2913534\n10.1007/s10898-007-9149-x"}
{"title": "Acoustic Biosensors and Microfluidic Devices in the Decennium: Principles and Applications.", "abstract": "Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology has gained primary attention in the past decade, where label-free biosensors and microfluidic actuation platforms are integrated to realize such LOC devices. Among the multitude of technologies that enables the successful integration of these two features, the piezoelectric acoustic wave method is best suited for handling biological samples due to biocompatibility, label-free and non-invasive properties. In this review paper, we present a study on the use of acoustic waves generated by piezoelectric materials in the area of label-free biosensors and microfluidic actuation towards the realization of LOC and POC devices. The categorization of acoustic wave technology into the bulk acoustic wave and surface acoustic wave has been considered with the inclusion of biological sample sensing and manipulation applications. This paper presents an approach with a comprehensive study on the fundamental operating principles of acoustic waves in biosensing and microfluidic actuation, acoustic wave modes suitable for sensing and actuation, piezoelectric materials used for acoustic wave generation, fabrication methods, and challenges in the use of acoustic wave modes in biosensing. Recent developments in the past decade, in various sensing potentialities of acoustic waves in a myriad of applications, including sensing of proteins, disease biomarkers, DNA, pathogenic microorganisms, acoustofluidic manipulation, and the sorting of biological samples such as cells, have been given primary focus. An insight into the future perspectives of real-time, label-free, and portable LOC devices utilizing acoustic waves is also presented. The developments in the field of thin-film piezoelectric materials, with the possibility of integrating sensing and actuation on a single platform utilizing the reversible property of smart piezoelectric materials, provide a step forward in the realization of monolithic integrated LOC and POC devices. Finally, the present paper highlights the key benefits and challenges in terms of commercialization, in the field of acoustic wave-based biosensors and actuation platforms.", "journal":

During the operation of a moving plate compressed and sliding on the top of a piezoelectric patch with constant velocity, dynamic shear deformation of the elastic piezoelectric patch is excited by periodic friction force and status (sliding and stick) variation. The dynamic piezoelectric shear strain can then generate continuous electrical power for energy absorbing and harvesting applications. The design of the piezoelectric couple device is first provided, and its mechanism, dynamic response and electric power generation under friction are described by a detailed iteration model. By comparing with previous experimental results, the accuracy of the proposed model is proven. Through numerical studies, the influences of the equivalent mass of the system, the velocity of the sliding object, the static friction coefficient and its lower limit, as well as the friction force delay rate on the power generation are obtained and discussed.

{"title": "Enhancement of Bone Regeneration Through the Converse Piezoelectric Effect, A Novel Approach for Applying Mechanical Stimulation.", "abstract": "Serious bone injuries have devastating effects on the lives of patients including limiting working ability and high cost. Orthopedic implants can aid in healing injuries to an extent that exceeds the natural regenerative capabilities of bone to repair fractures or large bone defects. Autografts and allografts are the standard implants used, but disadvantages such as donor site complications, a limited quantity of transplantable bone, and high costs have led to an increased demand for synthetic bone graft substitutes. However, replicating the complex physiological properties of biological bone, much less recapitulating its complex tissue functions, is challenging. Extensive efforts to design biocompatible implants that mimic the natural healing processes in bone have led to the investigation of piezoelectric smart materials because the bone has natural piezoelectric properties. Piezoelectric materials facilitate bone regeneration either by accumulating electric charge in response to mechanical stress, which mimics bioelectric signals through the direct piezoelectric effect or by providing mechanical stimulation in response to electrical stimulation through the converse piezoelectric effect. Although both effects are beneficial, the converse piezoelectric effect can address bone atrophy from stress shielding and immobility by improving the mechanical response of a healing defect. Mechanical stimulation has a positive impact on bone regeneration by activating cellular pathways that increase bone formation and decrease bone resorption. This review will highlight the potential of the converse piezoelectric effect to enhance bone regeneration by discussing the activation of beneficial cellular pathways, the properties of piezoelectric biomaterials, and the potential for the more effective administration of the converse piezoelectric effect using wireless control.", "journal": "Bioelectricity", "date": "2022-01-13", "authors": ["AmberCarter", "KristenPopowski", "KeCheng", "AlonGreenbaum", "Frances SLigler", "AdeleMoatti"], "doi": "10.1089/bioe.2021.0019\n10.1097/00003086-199201000-00014\n10.1097/00003086-199810001-00014\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2011.0258"}

The PSD method uses photodegradable polyethylene glycol hydrogels functionalized with bioaffinity ligands to bind and detach microscale, microbial aggregates from the membrane for microscopic observation. Subsequent exposure of the hydrogel to high resolution, patterned UV light allows for controlled release of any selected aggregate of desired size at high purity for DNA extraction. Follow-up 16S community analysis reveals aggregate composition, correlating microscopic images with the bacterial community structure.

To address the need for an on-demand drug delivery system for precise control over the release time and the quantity of drugs, we exploited the mechano-responsiveness of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) nanofibers for drug delivery applications. The large surface area-to-volume ratio inherent to nanomaterials, together with the transformative piezoelectric properties, allowed us to use the material as an ultrasensitive and mechano-responsive drug delivery platform driven by the direct piezoelectric effect. The intrinsic negative zeta potential of the nanofibers was utilized to electrostatically load cationic drug molecules, where surface potential changes by exogenous mechanical actuation trigger the release of drug molecules. We show that the drug release kinetics of the P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers depends on the fiber diameter, thus piezoelectric properties.

{"title": "Multiferroic Coupling of Ferromagnetic and Ferroelectric Particles through Elastic Polymers.", "abstract": "Multiferroics are materials that electrically polarize when subjected to a magnetic field and magnetize under the action of an electric field. In composites, the multiferroic effect is achieved by mixing of ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) particles. The FM particles are prone to magnetostriction (field-induced deformation), whereas the FE particles display piezoelectricity (electrically polarize under mechanical stress). In solid composites, where the FM and FE grains are in tight contact, the combination of these effects directly leads to multiferroic behavior. In the present work, we considered the FM/FE composites with soft polymer bases, where the particles of alternative kinds are remote from one another. In these systems, the multiferroic coupling is different and more complicated in comparison with the solid ones as it is essentially mediated by an electromagnetically neutral matrix. When either of the fields, magnetic or electric, acts on the 'akin' particles (FM or FE) it causes their displacement and by that perturbs the particle elastic environments. The induced mechanical stresses spread over the matrix and inevitably affect the particles of an alternative kind. Therefore, magnetization causes an electric response (due to the piezoeffect in FE) whereas electric polarization might entail a magnetic response (due to the magnetostriction effect in FM). A numerical model accounting for the multiferroic behavior of a polymer composite of the above-described type is proposed and confirmed experimentally on a polymer-based dispersion of iron and lead zirconate micron-size particles.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["Liudmila AMakarova", "Danil AIsaev", "Alexander SOmelyanchik", "Iuliia AAlekhina", "Matvey BIsaenko", "Valeria VRodionova", "Yuriy LRaikher", "Nikolai SPerov"], "doi": "10.3390/polym14010153\n10.1038/s41563-018-0275-2\n10.1126/science.1113357\n10.3390/ma13184033\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04665.x\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.04.006\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.04.037\n10.3390/nano11051154\n10.1016/j.cma.2015.10.013\n10.1103/PhysRevB.70.134417\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.108348\n10.1002/mame.200900301\n10.32931/io1926r\n10.1002/adem.201400258\n10.1088/1361-6463/abb7b7\n10.1038/nature25443\n10.1038/s41467-018-06491-9\n10.1126/scirobotics.aax7329\n10.1002/pat.3190\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.05.024\n10.1109/TMAG.2017.2699740\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.11.121\n10.1039/c3sm52523f\n10.3390/ijms20092230\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.10.107\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2016.09.056\n10.1039/c1sm05714f\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2014.11.008\n10.1039/C8SM01850B\n10.1103/PhysRev.159.98"}

In the proposed method, a piezoelectric-ceramic-chip is used as the micro-displacement driver of the optical fiber bundle, which has the advantages of small volume, fast response speed and high precision. The corresponding displacement of the optical fiber bundle can be generated by precise voltage controlling. An optical fiber bundle with core/cladding diameter 4/80 \u03bcm and hexagonal arrangement is used to scan the 1951 USAF target.

{"title": "Recent Development of Flexible Tactile Sensors and Their Applications.", "abstract": "With the rapid development of society in recent decades, the wearable sensor has attracted attention for motion-based health care and artificial applications. However, there are still many limitations to applying them in real life, particularly the inconvenience that comes from their large size and non-flexible systems. To solve these problems, flexible small-sized sensors that use body motion as a stimulus are studied to directly collect more accurate and diverse signals. In particular, tactile sensors are applied directly on the skin and provide input signals of motion change for the flexible reading device. This review provides information about different types of tactile sensors and their working mechanisms that are piezoresistive, piezocapacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric. Moreover, this review presents not only the applications of the tactile sensor in motion sensing and health care monitoring, but also their contributions in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years.

{"title": "Harvesting Energy from Bridge Vibration by Piezoelectric Structure with Magnets Tailoring Potential Energy.", "abstract": "Bridges play an increasingly more important role in modern transportation, which is why many sensors are mounted on it in order to provide safety. However, supplying reliable power to these sensors has always been a great challenge. Scavenging energy from bridge vibration to power the wireless sensors has attracted more attention in recent years. Moreover, it has been proved that the linear energy harvester cannot always work efficiently since the vibration energy of the bridge distributes over a broad frequency band. In this paper, a nonlinear energy harvester is proposed to enhance the performance of harvesting bridge vibration energy. Analyses on potential energy, restoring force, and stiffness were carried out. By adjusting the separation distance between magnets, the harvester could own a low and flat potential energy, which could help the harvester oscillate on a high-energy orbit and generate high output. For validation, corresponding experiments were carried out. The results show that the output of the optimal configuration outperforms that of the linear one. Moreover, with the increase in vehicle speed, a component of extremely low frequency is gradually enhanced, which corresponds to the motion on the high-energy orbit. This study may give an effective method of harvesting energy from bridge vibration excited by moving vehicles with different moving speeds.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["ZhiyongZhou", "HaiweiZhang", "WeiyangQin", "PeiZhu", "PingWang", "WenfengDu"], "doi": "10.3390/ma15010033\n10.3390/ma13020405\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.044\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108419\n10.1063/1.5126476\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112835\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119981\n10.1177/1045389X16633767\n10.1177/1045389X11417650\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/10/104005\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/9/095019\n10.1177/1045389X11420593\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.07.013\n10.1016/j.apm.2017.04.043\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/9/095024\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107848\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117838\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.08.001\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.02.017\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.03.023\n10.1063/1.5022599\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.018\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2013.08.009\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.11.018\n10.1063/1.4795296\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2015.08.002\n10.1007/s10409-020-00928-5\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/4/045007\n10.1177/1045389X12443016"}

Deplaquing and scaling with curettes and ultrasonic instruments may inadvertently increase the surface roughness of the material and the risk of future bacterial adhesion and/or also compromise the marginal seal of the prosthesis. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the qualitative effects of two types of curettes and one piezoelectric instrument with a stainless-steel tip on three types of metal-free samples. After treating the samples with different instrumentations, they were analyzed using the scanning electron microscope and then underwent a qualitative microanalysis by using a spectroscopy machine. All the materials tested in this study have undergone significant changes of their superficial structure after instrumentation both with mechanical and manual instruments. Plastic curettes appeared to be less aggressive than the other instruments.

{"title": "Biocompatibility and Electrical Stimulation of Skeletal and Smooth Muscle Cells Cultured on Piezoelectric Nanogenerators.", "abstract": "Nanogenerators are interesting for biomedical applications, with a great potential for electrical stimulation of excitable cells. Piezoelectric ZnO nanosheets present unique properties for tissue engineering. In this study, nanogenerator arrays based on ZnO nanosheets are fabricated on transparent coverslips to analyse the biocompatibility and the electromechanical interaction with two types of muscle cells, smooth and skeletal. Both cell types adhere, proliferate and differentiate on the ZnO nanogenerators. Interestingly, the amount of Zn ions released over time from the nanogenerators does not interfere with cell viability and does not trigger the associated inflammatory response, which is not triggered by the nanogenerators themselves either. The local electric field generated by the electromechanical nanogenerator-cell interaction stimulates smooth muscle cells by increasing cytosolic calcium ions, whereas no stimulation effect is observed on skeletal muscle cells. The random orientation of the ZnO nanogenerators, avoiding an overall action potential aligned along the muscle fibre, is hypothesised to be the cause of the cell-type dependent response. This demonstrates the need of optimizing the nanogenerator morphology, orientation and distribution according to the potential biomedical use. Thus, this study demonstrates the cell-scale stimulation triggered by biocompatible piezoelectric nanogenerators without using an external source on smooth muscle cells, although it remarks the cell type-dependent response.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["AndreuBlanquer", "OriolCareta", "LauraAnido-Varela", "AidaAranda", "ElenaIb\u00e1\u00f1ez", "JaumeEsteve", "CarmeNogu\u00e9s", "GonzaloMurillo"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23010432\n10.1021/acsnano.5b03162\n10.1155/2014/986912\n10.1002/elsc.201400144\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.05.049\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.07.012\n10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00661\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.12.055\n10.3390/nano7110374\n10.3390/nu10010016\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2018.10.009\n10.1039/C4TB00403E\n10.1002/jbm.a.30789\n10.1002/jbm.b.31948\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.05.029\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.12.055\n10.1002/adma.201002255\n10.3390/nano7040080\n10.1002/adma.201605048\n10.3390/s16122068\n10.1002/term.93\n10.1042/BC20060039\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.10.044\n10.1038/s41598-018-29843-3\n10.1002/admt.201800631\n10.1016/j.envint.2013.02.013\n10.1038/srep26661\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2004.03.022\n10.5772/55353\n10.1016/j.micron.2014.08.010\n10.1016/j.msec.2011.11.001\n10.1039/C8NR10384D\n10.1038/srep04781\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.12.005\n10.1039/c3ra43499k\n10.1007/BF02446406\n10.1007/s10047-009-0457-4"}
{"title": "Heparin Enriched-WPI Coating on Ti6Al4V Increases Hydrophilicity and Improves Proliferation and Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells.", "abstract": "Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) is one of the most prominent biomaterials for bone contact because of its ability to bear mechanical loading and resist corrosion. The success of Ti6Al4V implants depends on bone formation on the implant surface. Hence, implant coatings which promote adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of bone-forming cells are desirable. One coating strategy is by adsorption of biomacromolecules. In this study, Ti6Al4V substrates produced by additive manufacturing (AM) were coated with whey protein isolate (WPI) fibrils, obtained at pH 2, and heparin or tinzaparin (a low molecular weight heparin LMWH) in order to improve the proliferation and differentiation of bone-forming cells. WPI fibrils proved to be an excellent support for the growth of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). Indeed, WPI fibrils were resistant to sterilization and were stable during storage. This WPI-heparin-enriched coating, especially the LMWH, enhanced the differentiation of hBMSC by increasing tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) activity. Finally, the coating increased the hydrophilicity of the material. The results confirmed that WPI fibrils are an excellent biomaterial which can be used for biomedical coatings, as they are easily modifiable and resistant to heat treatments. Indeed, the already known positive effect on osteogenic integration of WPI-only coated substrates has been further enhanced by a simple adsorption procedure.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2022-01-12", "authors": ["DavideFacchetti", "UteHempel", "LaurineMartocq", "Alan MSmith", "AndreyKoptyug", "Roman ASurmenev", "Maria ASurmeneva", "Timothy E LDouglas"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms23010139\n10.3390/ma7128168\n10.1021/bm0609644\n10.1002/jbm.a.31501\n10.3390/ijms21176406\n10.3390/mi10010068\n10.1021/acsami.6b09241\n10.3168/jds.2017-13119\n10.1016/j.matdes.2019.108408\n10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.11.016\n10.1021/bm7014224\n10.1016/j.matlet.2018.05.060\n10.1016/j.jsb.2004.08.002\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2019.08.038\n10.3390/ijms21155544\n10.1016/S0141-8130(03)00072-2\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.011\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2011.02328.x\n10.1007/978-1-60327-169-1_2\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1002/jcb.24814\n10.1016/j.bone.2015.04.039\n10.1002/term.1507\n10.1038/srep36418\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.02.114\n10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.07.001\n10.1186/s12859-017-1934-z\n10.1634/stemcells.22-3-377\n10.1155/2016/7842191\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.10.026"}

In this work, we showed that the angiogenic behavior of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells can be inhibited by using nutlin-3a-loaded ApoE-functionalized polymeric piezoelectric nanoparticles, which can remotely respond to ultrasound stimulation.

Prolong experience of this phenomenon may lead to severe engine damage. The low intensity of this phenomenon is difficult to recognize due to other noises from the engine. Thus, improper engine tuning techniques may make this phenomenon unnoticeable until the engine damages. Knock phenomena on such engines may not be detected in the combustion analysis graph. Its random occurrence in consecutive engine cycles makes it difficult to be seen using visual data. This knowledge gap, if closed, can lead to an opportunity for knock avoidance on the multifuel engine. This work proposed a method to quantify the knock occurrence based on engine block vibration using a single piezoelectric knock sensor. The knock occurrence was detected by comparing the calculated knock index with the knock threshold, determined using a statistical three-sigma rule analysis.

This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effect of testicular morphology on the development of embryos to the blastocyst stage obtained from ROSI. Between September 2019 and March 2020, after TESE and biopsy 29 patients who had only spermatid were taken to study. Tubular appearance, basal membrane appearance, Johnson score, peritubular fibrosis, interstitial fibrosis, and Leydig cell proliferation were pathologically examined. Following egg collection, ROSI was applied to the oocytes using the piezoelectric method. The embryos were monitored until the blastocyst stage. The mean age of the 29 patients was 36.3\u00b15.01 years. Also, 7 patients had not previously undergone TESE, 20 had previously undergone once, and 2 had previously undergone twice. It was observed that having a history of TESE and a high Johnson score increased the likelihood of the embryo remaining in the blastocyst stage (P=0.021 and 0.014, respectively). However, other parameters do not affect the likelihood of blastocyst formation (P>0.05). Low TESE history and high Johnson score were associated with embryo development to the blastocyst stage.

{"title": "Progress in understanding the structural mechanism underlying prestin's electromotile activity.", "abstract": "Prestin (SLC26A5), a member of the SLC26 transporter family, is the molecular actuator that drives OHC electromotility (eM). A wealth of biophysical data indicates that eM is mediated by an area motor mechanism, in which prestin molecules act as elementary actuators by changing their area in the membrane in response to changes in membrane potential. The area changes of a large and densely packed population of prestin molecules sum up, resulting in macroscopic cellular movement. At the single protein level, this model implies major voltage-driven conformational rearrangements. However, the nature of these structural dynamics remained unknown. A main obstacle in elucidating the eM mechanism has been the lack of structural information about SLC26 transporters. The recent emergence of several high-resolution cryo-EM structures of prestin as well as other SLC26 transporter family members now provides a reliable picture of prestin's molecular architecture. Thus, SLC26 transporters including prestin generally are dimers, and each protomer is folded according to a 7+7 transmembrane domain inverted repeat (7TMIR) architecture. Here, we review these structural findings and discuss insights into a potential molecular mechanism. Most important, distinct conformations were observed when purifying and imaging prestin bound to either its physiological ligand, chloride, or to competitively inhibitory anions, sulfate or salicylate. Despite differences in detail, these structural snapshots indicate that the conformational landscape of prestin includes rearrangements between the two major domains of prestin's transmembrane region (TMD), core and scaffold ('gate') domains. Notably, distinct conformations differ in the area the TMD occupies in the membrane and in their impact on the immediate lipid environment. Both effects can contribute to generate membrane deformation and thus may underly electromotility. Further functional studies will be necessary to determine whether these or similar structural rearrangements are driven by membrane potential to mediate piezoelectric activity.

Mammalian antibodies have been widely investigated as biorecognition ligands due to high specificity and technological advancement in antibody production. However, antibody-based biosensors are not considered as an efficient approach due to the batch-to-batch inconsistencies as well as low stability. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been increasingly investigated as ligands as they have demonstrated high stability and possessed multiple sites for capturing bacteria. The conjugation of chemo-selective groups with AMPs has allowed effective immobilization of peptides on biosensor surface. However, the specificity of AMPs is a major concern for consideration as an efficient ligand.

Analytical models of the open-circuit voltage outputs of an infinite-strip-shaped PVDF bimorph cantilever in an underwater sound field are developed. Results show that the sound pressure generates the sum of the outputs, while the particle velocity normal to the PVDF surface generates the difference. The sensitivities of the pressure- and velocity-generated voltage responses with respect to an incident plane sound field demonstrate uniform directivity in a low-frequency range, which is suitable for acoustical intensity determination. The higher velocity sensitivity confirms the advantage of using a PVDF bimorph as a velocity sensor, owing to its light weight and flexibility. An algorithm for determining the complex acoustical intensity normal to the surface is proposed by utilizing those voltage responses and the probe gain calibrated with a given angle of incident sound. This algorithm allows accurate determination of sound intensity of a plane wave field, where the reactive part of intensity is absent.

Thus, it is also subjected to the RC time constant problem. Association of OHCs with a system with mechanical resonance leads to piezoelectric resonance. This resonance can nullify the membrane capacitance and solves the RC time constant problem for OHCs. Therefore, avian and mammalian ears solve the same problem in the opposite way.

Miniature bidirectional rotary actuators with high-precision and controllable fallback rate require novel driving principles. Here, on the basis of a proposed biomimetic stick-slip motion principle, a novel piezoelectric-thermal coupling bidirectional rotary actuator was developed. The integrated mantis grasping leglike biomimetic claws and heating rods could realize the clockwise macroscopic rotation and anticlockwise macroscopic fallback of a cylindrical rotator, generated by piezoelectric stick-slip and thermal expansion, respectively. The rotation fallback was effectively inhibited at relatively lower frequencies and higher voltages, as a slight fallback rate of 0.095 was confirmed in term of 0.5 Hz and 80 V. An extraordinary piezoelectric-driven macroscopic rotation resolution of 0.2 \u03bcrad and thermal-induced microscopic resolution of 0.00073\u00b0/\u00b0C were experimentally revealed with the aid of real-time observation of the clockwise slow sticking and anticlockwise instantaneous slipping processes by using three-dimensional optical imaging.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2021-12-30", "authors": ["ZhichaoMa", "JunmingXiong", "JiakaiLi", "HongweiZhao", "LuquanRen"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c04296"}

{"title": "Application of Pyroelectric Sensors Based on PVDF Films for EPR Spectra Detection by Heat Release.", "abstract": "Pyroelectrics are a wide class of materials that change their polarization when the system temperature varies. This effect is utilized for a number of different commercial and industrial applications ranging from simple thermal sensors and laser interferometers to water vapor harvesting. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying the structure and dynamics of materials with unpaired electrons. Since heating accompanies a resonant change of the orientation of electron spins in an external magnetic field, pyroelectrics can be utilized as versatile detectors for so-called indirect detection of the EPR signal. In this work, we investigated three different types of PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) standard pyroelectric films with indium tin oxide, Cu/Ni, and Au coatings to determine their sensitivity for detecting EPR signals. All the films were shown to be able to detect the EPR spectra of about 1 \u03bcg of a standard stable free radical by heat release. A comparative study based on the calculation of the noise-equivalent power and specific detectivity from experimental spectra showed that the Au coated PVDF film is the most promising active element for measuring the EPR signal. Using the best achieved sensitivity, estimation is given whether this is sufficient for using a PVDF-based pyrodetector for indirectly detecting EPR spectra by recombination heat release or not.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-29", "authors": ["Anatoly RMelnikov", "Samat BZikirin", "Evgeny VKalneus", "Vladimir IIvannikov", "Yuri AGrishin", "Oleg AAnisimov"], "doi": "10.3390/s21248426\n10.1109/58.883516\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2879122\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.11.065\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/S0142-9418(03)00003-5\n10.1088/1742-6596/656/1/012051\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/SSP.124-126.299\n10.1063/1.1520314\n10.1063/1.1707912\n10.1063/1.91850\n10.1063/1.92951\n10.1016/0009-2614(77)80024-9\n10.1016/0009-2614(79)85013-7\n10.1364/AO.9.000063\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.666\n10.1016/S0009-2614(00)01361-0\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.157401\n10.1038/nmat2252\n10.1103/PhysRevB.68.245105\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2004.03.055\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.137403\n10.1002/anie.202002477\n10.1063/1.5120704\n10.1103/PhysRevB.102.020101\n10.1103/PhysRevB.95.241201\n10.1002/macp.201700395\n10.1364/OE.386438\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00411-8\n10.1016/0009-2614(91)90143-W\n10.1063/1.2062916"}

The conventional sensor must be powered by a battery device, while innovative self-powered sensors can provide power for the sensing device. Self-powered flexible sensors can have higher mobility, wider distribution, and even wireless operation, while solving the problem of the limited life of the battery so that it can be continuously operated and widely utilized. In recent years, the studies on piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have mainly concentrated on self-powered flexible sensors.

{"title": "Sputter Deposited Magnetostrictive Layers for SAW Magnetic Field Sensors.", "abstract": "For the best possible limit of detection of any thin film-based magnetic field sensor, the functional magnetic film properties are an essential parameter. For sensors based on magnetostrictive layers, the chemical composition, morphology and intrinsic stresses of the layer have to be controlled during film deposition to further control magnetic influences such as crystallographic effects, pinning effects and stress anisotropies. For the application in magnetic surface acoustic wave sensors, the magnetostrictive layers are deposited on rotated piezoelectric single crystal substrates. The thermomechanical properties of quartz can lead to undesirable layer stresses and associated magnetic anisotropies if the temperature increases during deposition. With this in mind, we compare amorphous, magnetostrictive FeCoSiB films prepared by RF and DC magnetron sputter deposition. The chemical, structural and magnetic properties determined by elastic recoil detection, X-ray diffraction, and magneto-optical magnetometry and magnetic domain analysis are correlated with the resulting surface acoustic wave sensor properties such as phase noise level and limit of detection. To confirm the material properties, SAW sensors with magnetostrictive layers deposited with RF and DC deposition have been prepared and characterized, showing comparable detection limits below 200 pT/Hz", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-29", "authors": ["LarsThorm\u00e4hlen", "DennisSeidler", "ViktorSchell", "FransMunnik", "JeffreyMcCord", "DirkMeyners"], "doi": "10.3390/s21248386\n10.1109/58.238094\n10.1109/ICSENS.2007.355540\n10.1016/j.snb.2004.03.015\n10.1002/admt.202100860\n10.1038/s41598-017-18441-4\n10.1063/1.5044478\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.024001\n10.1063/1.5140562\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111998\n10.7567/JJAP.51.07GC21\n10.1109/TMAG.2012.2201928\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.14.014053\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976052\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab522d\n10.1063/1.1667793\n10.1016/j.physb.2006.02.009\n10.1016/S0168-583X(97)00778-7\n10.1063/1.119524\n10.1016/j.tsf.2008.07.014\n10.1063/1.4812706\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2914965\n10.3390/s17040801\n10.1063/1.5012579\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab7857\n10.1088/0022-3727/48/33/333001\n10.1016/S0040-6090(02)00941-0\n10.1016/0040-6090(89)90030-8\n10.3390/s21165631\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.13.024018\n10.1063/1.4901948\n10.1109/TMAG.2002.802467\n10.1109/TMAG.1976.1059134\n10.1063/1.1562732\n10.1038/nmat3306\n10.1557/jmr.2017.58\n10.1063/1.5092942\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112926\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2998826"}

The design of sensors used for MMG and their spatial distribution are among the deciding factors behind their successful implementation to HMI. We present a new design of a MMG sensor, which consists of two coupled piezoelectric discs in a single housing. The sensor's functionality was verified in two experimental setups related to typical MMG applications: an estimation of the force/MMG relationship under static conditions and a neural network-based gesture classification. The results showed exponential relationships between acquired MMG and exerted force (for up to 60% of the maximal voluntary contraction) alongside good classification accuracy (94.3%) of eight hand motions based on MMG from a single-site acquisition at the forearm.

{"title": "Human Body Performance with COVID-19 Affectation According to Virus Specification Based on Biosensor Techniques.", "abstract": "Life was once normal before the first announcement of COVID-19's first case in Wuhan, China, and what was slowly spreading became an overnight worldwide pandemic. Ever since the virus spread at the end of 2019, it has been morphing and rapidly adapting to human nature changes which cause difficult conundrums in the efforts of fighting it. Thus, researchers were steered to investigate the virus in order to contain the outbreak considering its novelty and there being no known cure. In contribution to that, this paper extensively reviewed, compared, and analyzed two main points; SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission in humans and detection methods of COVID-19 in the human body. SARS-CoV-2 human exchange transmission methods reviewed four modes of transmission which are Respiratory Transmission, Fecal-Oral Transmission, Ocular transmission, and Vertical Transmission. The latter point particularly sheds light on the latest discoveries and advancements in the aim of COVID-19 diagnosis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus associated with this disease in the human body. The methods in this review paper were classified into two categories which are RNA-based detection including RT-PCR, LAMP, CRISPR, and NGS and secondly, biosensors detection including, electrochemical biosensors, electronic biosensors, piezoelectric biosensors, and optical biosensors.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-29", "authors": ["Mohammed Jawad AhmedAlathari", "YousifAl Mashhadany", "Mohd Hadri HafizMokhtar", "NorhafizahBurham", "Mohd Saiful DzulkeflyBin Zan", "Ahmad AshrifA Bakar", "NorhanaArsad"], "doi": "10.3390/s21248362\n10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.019\n10.1002/jmv.25681\n10.2307/1588476\n10.1016/j.jiph.2020.07.011\n10.1128/MMBR.69.4.635-664.2005\n10.1016/j.cll.2009.07.007\n10.1073/pnas.0506735102\n10.1007/s00604-020-04615-x\n10.1056/NEJMoa030634\n10.1056/NEJMoa030685\n10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13077-2\n10.1172/JCI18819\n10.1056/NEJMoa030747\n10.1016/j.tmaid.2016.09.008\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.06.001\n10.1016/j.idc.2019.08.001\n10.1016/j.jiph.2016.11.015\n10.1007/s13238-013-3096-8\n10.1128/JVI.03649-13\n10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003\n10.1016/j.cmrp.2020.03.011\n10.3390/ijerph17114140\n10.1503/cmaj.75428\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.018\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.016\n10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.024\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105955\n10.3390/diagnostics11061119\n10.1111/cbdd.13761\n10.2174/1874357901004010076\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9\n10.1073/pnas.0805270106\n10.1128/JVI.00645-06\n10.1089/nat.2020.0868\n10.1101/2020.02.16.951723\n10.1016/j.it.2020.03.007\n10.36316/gcatr.02.0037\n10.4236/opj.2016.65011\n10.1007/s00330-020-06934-2\n10.1016/j.imu.2020.100506\n10.1007/s13755-021-00146-8\n10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113909\n10.1109/RBME.2020.2987975\n10.20944/preprints202003.0300.v1\n10.1101/2020.05.12.20098954\n10.1148/radiol.2020200905\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.166405\n10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114883\n10.1007/s12530-021-09385-2\n10.5152/electrica.2021.21005\n10.9781/ijimai.2021.04.002\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110495\n10.1101/2020.04.04.20053363\n10.1038/s41591-020-0931-3\n10.1021/acsabm.0c01004\n10.3390/ijerph18063056\n10.3390/sym12040651\n10.2196/23693\n10.1021/acsnano.0c02439\n10.1021/acsnano.0c02823\n10.1021/acsnano.0c04421\n10.1007/s41403-020-00122-w\n10.1007/s41403-020-00128-4\n10.1088/2515-7647/abd4ee\n10.1016/j.bios.2021.113192\n10.3389/fchem.2021.672739\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112686\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000867\n10.1080/22221751.2020.1772678\n10.1007/s40843-020-1577-y\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00784\n10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000270\n10.1136/bmj.m1996\n10.1056/NEJMc2004973\n10.3390/ijerph17051729\n10.1007/s11356-021-14519-9\n10.1038/s41598-019-38808-z\n10.1021/acs.est.0c01102\n10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30514-2\n10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.065\n10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620\n10.1111/1751-2980.12851\n10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902\n10.1016/j.coviro.2016.11.001\n10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.045\n10.1101/2020.01.30.927806\n10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.055\n10.1038/s41433-020-0965-2\n10.1038/s41591-020-0868-6\n10.1016/j.jtos.2020.06.007\n10.1097/ICO.0000000000002509\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316304\n10.1080/09273948.2020.1799035\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30313-5\n10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30191-2\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.572567\n10.1101/2021.01.25.21250452\n10.1371/journal.pone.0230295\n10.1093/cid/ciaa225\n10.1038/nri.2017.64\n10.1080/15513815.2020.1747120\n10.1016/j.jri.2020.103122\n10.1094/PHYTO-02-18-0067-R\n10.3390/cimb43020061\n10.1126/science.1181498\n10.3389/fnano.2020.588795\n10.3390/ijms17111880\n10.1007/s00705-017-3281-9\n10.1007/s40495-020-00229-2\n10.1021/acscentsci.0c00501\n10.1007/s40820-020-00533-y\n10.1101/2020.03.02.20030130\n10.1080/15257770701845204\n10.1007/s13337-020-00599-7\n10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.03.006\n10.1016/j.bpc.2020.106538\n10.1101/2020.09.28.20201947\n10.1128/JCM.00280-07\n10.3233/BME-151526\n10.1128/JCM.02533-13\n10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000152\n10.1038/s41586-020-2380-z\n10.3389/fmicb.2018.01101\n10.1007/s13206-019-3404-3\n10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.012\n10.3390/diagnostics11010053\n10.3390/s20236764\n10.1002/ange.201901879\n10.3390/s21155114\n10.1021/acsomega.8b02458\n10.3390/s8042043\n10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00724\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.07.030\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b01803\n10.1007/s10096-020-04001-8\n10.3390/ma11030448\n10.1002/jbm.820060608\n10.1088/0957-4484/24/18/185501\n10.1021/ac035367b\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.12.013\n10.1007/s10096-018-3230-x\n10.1002/adma.202005448\n10.3390/s100706535\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.03.131\n10.3390/bios11080253\n10.1039/C4CS00346B\n10.3390/toxins10050197\n10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524\n10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122800\n10.1007/s00604-021-04974-z\n10.1016/j.bios.2009.07.012\n10.1109/JSEN.2021.3107736\n10.1101/2020.04.24.059204\n10.1007/s00604-019-3345-5"}

{"title": "Characterization of Anticipatory Postural Adjustments in Lateral Stepping: Impact of Footwear and Lower Limb Preference.", "abstract": "Lateral stepping is a motor task that is widely used in everyday life to modify the base of support, change direction, and avoid obstacles. Anticipatory Postural Adjustments (APAs) are often analyzed to describe postural preparation prior to forward stepping, however, little is known about lateral stepping. The aim of the study is to characterize APAs preceding lateral steps and to investigate how these are affected by footwear and lower limb preference. Twenty-two healthy young participants performed a lateral step using both their preferred and non-preferred leg in both barefoot and shod conditions.

The piezoelectric lead-zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors were inserted inside the composite structures during the manufacturing process to monitor important curing parameters, including the storage modulus of resin and the progress of the reaction (POR). The strain that is related to the storage modulus and the state of resin was measured by embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, and the gelation moment identified by the FBG sensors was very close to those determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and POR. After curing, experiments were conducted on the fabricated CFRP specimen to investigate the damage identification capability of the embedded piezoelectric sensor network. Furthermore, a modified probability diagnostic imaging (PDI) algorithm with a dynamically adaptive shape factor and fusion frequency was proposed to indicate the damage location in the tested sample and to greatly improve the position precision. The experimental results demonstrated that the average relative distance error (RDE) of the modified PDI method was 68.48% and 46.97% lower than those of the conventional PDI method and the PDI method, respectively, with an averaged shape factor and fusion frequency, indicating the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed damage imaging method.

However, the difficulty of combining DBS sampling with DESI-MS is still the carrier material used for the blood samples. In this study, a new, easily obtained, and cost-effective carrier substrate for dried plasma spot (DPS) sampling and DESI-MS analysis and its application in phospholipidomics studies was described. First, the effects of several carrier materials, including cellulose-based materials (31\u00a0ET paper and filter paper) and non-cellulose-based materials (PARAFILM and its shape-modified material, PTFE-printed glass slide and polyvinylidene fluoride film), were tested. Second, a method combining DPS sampling with DESI-MS for phospholipidomics analysis was established, and parameters affecting compound signal intensities, such as sample volume and sprayer solvent system, were optimized. In conclusion, the total signal intensity obtained from shape-modified PARAFILM was the strongest. The suitable plasma sample volume deposited on PARAFILM carriers was 5\u00a0\u03bcl, and acetonitrile (ACN) was recommended as the optimal spray solvent for phospholipid (PL) profiling. Repeatability (87.5% of compounds with CV < 30%) and stability for data acquisition (48\u00a0h) were confirmed. Finally, the developed method was applied in phospholipidomics analysis of schistosomiasis, and a distinguished classification between control mice and infected mice was observed by using multivariate pattern recognition analysis, confirming the practical application of this new carrier material for DPS sampling and DESI-MS analysis. Compared with a previously reported method, the rapid metabolomics screening approach based on the implementation of DPS sampling coupled with the DESI-MS instrument developed in this study has increased analyte sensitivity, which may promote its further application in clinical studies.", "journal": "Frontiers in chemistry", "date": "2021-12-28", "authors": ["JiansongChen", "YueHu", "CongxiangShao", "HaiyunZhou", "ZhiyueLv"], "doi": "10.3389/fchem.2021.801043\n10.1021/ac102003t\n10.1038/nrn3820\n10.1007/s00216-020-02671-z\n10.1139/o59-099\n10.1007/s11306-006-0037-z\n10.1016/j.cplett.2008.08.020\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.05.006\n10.1194/jlr.e400004-jlr200\n10.4155/bio.11.97\n10.1039/c5an02302e\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.12.012\n10.1021/pr070183p\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.04.006\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2009.02.033\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.569727\n10.1021/ci000139t\n10.1039/b703524a\n10.1002/rcm.2566\n10.1002/mas.20247\n10.1002/rcm.2280\n10.1002/bmc.1367\n10.1016/j.jasms.2007.12.003\n10.1016/j.trac.2016.02.013\n10.1016/j.talanta.2012.09.059\n10.1038/nrendo.2016.169\n10.1021/ac070527v\n10.1039/c5ay00776c\n10.1038/srep22447\n10.1177/0004563217726809\n10.1039/c3an00544e\n10.1002/bmc.4344\n10.1021/ac500317c\n10.1021/ac503252g\n10.1007/s00216-015-8899-4\n10.1021/cr200295k\n10.1126/science.1104404\n10.1021/pr060594q\n10.1021/ac0615807\n10.1038/nature23007\n10.1039/b717693g\n10.1080/00313020701813743\n10.1039/b922329k\n10.1002/rcm.4121\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04732"}

A one-dimensional linearized model for the PS fiber is established, which is applied for the mechanical analysis of a selected profile with the cross section varying in a specific quadratic function. Numerical results indicate that the acoustoelectric fields in the space charge region of the non-uniform PS PN junction are more sensitive to the applied mechanical forces, compared with that of the uniform junction, especially for a heterogeneous PN junction.

{"title": "An Alternative Electro-Mechanical Finite Formulation for Functionally Graded Graphene-Reinforced Composite Beams with Macro-Fiber Composite Actuator.", "abstract": "With its extraordinary physical properties, graphene is regarded as one of the most attractive reinforcements to enhance the mechanical characteristics of composite materials. However, the existing models in the literature might meet severe challenges in the interlaminar-stress prediction of thick, functionally graded, graphene-reinforced-composite (FG-GRC)-laminated beams that have been integrated with piezoelectric macro-fiber-composite (MFC) actuators under electro-mechanical loadings. If the transverse shear deformations cannot be accurately described, then the mechanical performance of the FG-GRC-laminated beams with MFC actuators will be significantly impacted by the electro-mechanical coupling effect and the sudden change of the material characteristics at the interfaces. Therefore, a new electro-mechanical coupled-beam model with only four independent displacement variables is proposed in this paper. Employing the Hu-Washizu (HW) variational principle, the precision of the transverse shear stresses in regard to the electro-mechanical coupling effect can be improved. Moreover, the second-order derivatives of the in-plane displacement parameters have been removed from the transverse-shear-stress components, which can greatly simplify the finite-element implementation.

{"title": "Design of a Non-Contact Radial Torque Sensor with Variable Torque Range by Electromagnetic Coil Coupling with Piezoelectric Sensor.", "abstract": "Recently, due to the development of automation technology, torque measuring and monitoring technologies have been brought to the focus. However, the commercially available sensors have the disadvantage of large volume, which results in the difficulty of installation on existing automated machines. Responding to the above-mentioned problem, a contactless torque sensor that uses an electromagnetic coil combined with a permanent magnet was proposed. By adjusting the input electric current in the coil, the strength of the magnetic field can be controlled to generate a non-contact magnetic force to resist external torque loading. For the measurement of such a magnetic force, a cantilever-beam mechanism comprising a piezoelectric-loading (PZT-L) sensor is employed to estimate the external static force by measuring the variation of the electric impedance. According to the measured results, the proposed PZT-L sensor demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed design, for which the maximum estimated error was around 6%. Finally, the proposed contactless torque sensor with 11 cm in diameter and 2 cm in thickness was employed to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis. From the sensor characteristic measurement, the detection range for external torque can be from 7.8 to 125.6 N-mm when the driven current input ranged from 2 to 10 A. Therefore, the experimental results presented that the moment of inertia via the resisted torque can be adjusted by the proposed non-contact torque-sensing system according to the measuring condition.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-25", "authors": ["Sheng-HeWang"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14247695\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2366497\n10.1109/AFRCON.1996.562966\n10.1115/1.4025824\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2723041\n10.1109/FREQ.1998.717979\n10.1063/1.4902180\n10.3390/s16081251\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2016.03.021\n10.1073/pnas.44.4.285\n10.1016/j.ultras.2011.01.002\n10.3390/cryst11040380\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.09.015\n10.1016/S1007-0214(10)70029-8\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.04.024\n10.1109/JRPROC.1956.275147\n10.1243/14644207JMDA301"}

{"title": "Theoretical and Experimental Investigations into a Crawling Robot Propelled by Piezoelectric Material.", "abstract": "Conventional motors with complicated electromagnetic structures are difficult to miniaturise for millimetre- and centimetre-sized robots. Instead, small-scale robots are actuated using a variety of functional materials. We proposed a novel robot propelled by a piezoelectric ceramic in this work. The robot advances due to the asymmetric friction created by the spikes on the surface. The structural modelling was completed, static and dynamic models were established to predict the moving characteristics, the prototype was built using three dimensional (3D) printing technology, and the models were evaluated via experiments. Compared with conventional inchworm-type robots, the proposed robot is superior in simple structure because the clamping components are replaced by spikes with asymmetric friction. Compared with SMA (shape memory alloy) actuating inchworm-type robots, it has a faster velocity with higher resolution. Meanwhile, the components are printed through an additive manufacturing process that is convenient and avoids assembly errors.

{"title": "Adaptive Notch Filter for Piezo-Actuated Nanopositioning System via Position and Online Estimate Dual-Mode.", "abstract": "Due to the excellent advantages of high speed, high precision, and driving force, piezoelectric actuators nanopositioning systems have been widely used in various micro/nanomachining fields. However, the inherent resonance dynamic of the nanopositioning system generated by the flexure-hinge greatly deteriorates the positioning performance and limits the closed-loop bandwidth. Even worse, the notch filter for eliminating the effect of resonance does not work due to the varying resonant frequency resulting from the external disturbance or mass load. To this end, an adaptive notch filter for piezo-actuated nanopositioning system via position and online estimate dual-mode (POEDM) has been proposed in this paper, which can estimate the varying resonant frequency in real-time and suppress the resonance to improve the closed-loop bandwidth. First, a novel variable forgetting factor recursive least squares (VFF-RLS) algorithm for estimating resonant frequency online is presented, which is robust to the noise and provides the performances of both fast tracking and stability. Then, a POEDM method is proposed to achieve the online identification of the resonant frequency in the presence of noise and disturbance. Finally, a series of validation simulations are carried out, and the results indicate that, the frequency of input signal and the bandwidth have been achieved up to 12.5% and 87.5% of the first resonant frequency, respectively.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-12-25", "authors": ["ChengsiHuang", "HongchengLi"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12121525\n10.1109/TASE.2014.2352364\n10.1007/s11633-020-1225-4\n10.1109/5.915379\n10.1116/1.1808735\n10.1109/TCST.2007.903345\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.03.045\n10.1109/TASE.2015.2451368\n10.1109/TNANO.2013.2243752\n10.1109/TMECH.2013.2242482\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2004.10.003\n10.1109/TMECH.2016.2639584\n10.1002/asjc.95\n10.1109/TCST.2010.2049493\n10.1063/1.5064722\n10.1109/29.90388\n10.1109/78.134453\n10.1115/1.4001709\n10.1109/TIE.2006.870660\n10.1109/TIM.2019.2947121\n10.1007/s11431-020-1676-7\n10.1109/MCS.2008.930922\n10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2455\n10.1109/TMECH.2019.2891777\n10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.05.004\n10.1109/TCST.2011.2178095"}

{"title": "Microfluidic Cell Transport with Piezoelectric Micro Diaphragm Pumps.", "abstract": "The automated transport of cells can enable far-reaching cell culture research. However, to date, such automated transport has been achieved with large pump systems that often come with long fluidic connections and a large power consumption. Improvement is possible with space- and energy-efficient piezoelectric micro diaphragm pumps, though a precondition for a successful use is to enable transport with little to no mechanical stress on the cell suspension. This study evaluates the impact of the microfluidic transport of cells with the piezoelectric micro diaphragm pump developed by our group. It includes the investigation of different actuation signals. Therewith, we aim to achieve optimal fluidic performance while maximizing the cell viability. The investigation of fluidic properties proves a similar performance with a hybrid actuation signal that is a rectangular waveform with sinusoidal flanks, compared to the fluidically optimal rectangular actuation. The comparison of the cell transport with three actuation signals, sinusoidal, rectangular, and hybrid actuation shows that the hybrid actuation causes less damage than the rectangular actuation. With a 5% reduction of the cell viability it causes similar strain to the transport with sinusoidal actuation. Piezoelectric micro diaphragm pumps with the fluidically efficient hybrid signal actuation are therefore an interesting option for integrable microfluidic workflows.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-12-25", "authors": ["AgnesBu\u00dfmann", "ThomasThalhofer", "SophieHoffmann", "LeopoldDaum", "NivedhaSurendran", "OliverHayden", "J\u00fcrgenHubbuch", "MartinRichter"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12121459\n10.26717/BJSTR.2019.12.002294\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04310\n10.1089/107632703322066723\n10.1007/s10439-008-9459-2\n10.1039/b417651k\n10.1039/b405719h\n10.18063/ijb.v6i3.301\n10.1016/j.ajps.2019.11.003\n10.1016/j.drudis.2016.04.006\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.05.013\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.05.025\n10.1016/j.bjps.2015.11.015\n10.1016/j.addr.2017.09.018\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.08.013\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.07.016\n10.5966/sctm.2012-0088\n10.1039/C7LC01236E\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/6/R01\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2019.04.009\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112820\n10.1080/00150190490460867\n10.1039/b504468e\n10.1007/s10404-004-0007-6\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112649\n10.1016/0145-2126(94)90103-1\n10.1002/ijc.2910190505\n10.1016/0924-4247(94)00961-G\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.04.025\n10.1016/j.mne.2019.01.002\n10.1038/s41598-020-58161-w\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00317\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.05.018"}

The model is validated using experimental data of a commercial loudspeaker. Using the time domain equations of the equivalent electrical circuit of the loudspeaker inside the coupler and a state space formulation, the acoustic pressure response is calculated and compared to the measurement of the manufacturer. Next, the stiffness, transduction and capacitance nonlinear functions are evaluated with a Double-Beam Laser Interferometer (DBLI) and a nanoindenter on test devices and on the commercial loudspeaker. By introducing the nonlinear functions into the model as amplitude-dependent parameters, the THD generated by the loudspeaker is calculated and compared to the value provided by the manufacturer. The good agreement between the measurement and the simulation could allow for a rather quick simulation of the performance of similarly designed loudspeakers at the early stage of the design, by only estimating the static linearity of the main nonlinearity sources.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-12-25", "authors": ["RomainLiechti", "St\u00e9phaneDurand", "ThierryHilt", "FabriceCasset", "ChristophePoulain", "Gwena\u00eblLe Rhun", "FranklinPavageau", "HugoKuentz", "Mika\u00eblColin"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12121437\n10.1109/JSEN.2012.2213807\n10.1109/mems51782.2021.9375295\n10.1109/JMEMS.2021.3087718\n10.1016/S0924-4247(02)00310-2\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112018\n10.1109/transducers.2019.8808528\n10.1038/s41378-019-0095-9\n10.1109/transducers.2017.7994475\n10.1109/memsys.2018.8346744\n10.1016/B978-012480874-4/50022-1\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2013.03.032\n10.1121/1.423866\n10.1002/adfm.202005397\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.09.012\n10.1051/aacus/2019001\n10.17743/jaes.2018.0030\n10.1109/TMECH.2021.3112267\n10.1121/1.1577552\n10.1250/ast.41.75\n10.1109/EuroSimE52062.2021.9410865\n10.1109/58.764850\n10.1063/1.5019568\n10.1103/PhysRevB.81.144125\n10.1016/j.jmps.2007.03.008\n10.7567/JJAP.54.10NA04\n10.1038/s41598-019-43869-1\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2020.08.006\n10.1109/transducers.2019.8808241"}

In this study, a new carbon nanotube cross-linked polypyrrole composite ultrafiltration membrane (CNT-PPy/PVDF) was fabricated, and exhibited excellent conductivity, hydrophilicity, and permeability in a novel electro-filtration activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) system (EFAP) for cathodic electrochemical activation of PDS. The EFAP showed satisfactory performance in removal of series of small molecule organic pollutants (i.e., carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, phenol, diclofenac.) and stable removal ratio (remaining above 90% after 20 operating cycles). Further study proved the electric field could effectively protect the cathodic CNT-PPy/PVDF membrane from oxidative damage through continual free electrons injection. Besides, the EFAP achieved up to 95% flux recovery and 80% reduction of irreversible membrane fouling (bovine serum albumin as the model foulant).

Numerous utilizations, including sensors, actuators, and bio-application-its most exciting application to promote cell migration, differentiation, growth, and protein-surface interaction-originate from the piezoelectricity effect. Since PLA exhibits piezoelectricity in both crystalline structure and an amorphous state, it is crucial to study it closely to understand the source of such a phenomenon. In this respect, in the current study, we first reviewed the methods promoting piezoelectricity. The present work is a comprehensive review that was conducted to promote the low piezoelectric constant of PLA in numerous procedures. In this respect, its chemistry and structural origins have been explored in detail. Combining any other variables to induce a specific application or to improve any PLA barriers, namely, its hydrophobicity, poor electrical conductivity, or the tuning of its mechanical properties, especially in the application of cardiovascular tissue engineering, is also discussed wherever relevant.", "journal": "Journal of functional biomaterials", "date": "2021-12-24", "authors":

{"title": "Low- and High-Pressure Membrane Separation in the Production of Process Water for Coke Quenching.", "abstract": "Although the time for operating mines and coking plants in many countries is coming to an end due to climate change, we must still ensure that the pollution generated by this source of the economy is minimized. Despite the several stages of treatment of the coke-oven effluent, completed with nitrification and denitrification processes preceding final sedimentation, the stream obtained does not meet the requirements of water for coke quenching. That is why the stream after biodegradation and sedimentation was treated on membrane units to ensure water reusing in the coking plant. As the subjected stream contained both solid and dissolved pollutants, a two-stage system was proposed: low- and high-pressure membrane filtration. Industrial modules were tested on pilot units operating under industrial plant conditions. In the case of the ultrafiltration process, all the tested ultrafiltration modules fulfilled the primary task. All of them separated almost completely the turbidities present in the stream, which would have disturbed the operation of the high-pressure plant. Considering the decrease in permeate flux and the possibility of cleaning, a PCI membrane made of PVDF tubes with a diameter of 12.5 mm and pore size of 20 \u03bcm was selected. Regarding the high-pressure membrane filtration, the reverse osmosis membrane was significantly better in the removal efficiency of both organic and inorganic dissolved substances.

The membranes were fabricated by the dry-wet spinning technique. The prepared hollow fiber membranes were dip-coated by hydrophobic surface-modifying macromolecules (BSMM) as the final step fabrication. The additives combination is aimed to produce hollow fiber membranes with high flux permeation and high salt rejection in the matter of seawater desalination application. This study prepares hollow fiber membranes from the formulation of 18 wt. % of PVDF mixed with 5 wt. % of PEG and 3, 4, and 5 wt. % of LSMM. The membranes are then dip-coated with 1 wt. % of BSMM. The effect of LSMM loading on hydrophobicity, morphology, average pore size, surface porosity, and membrane performance is investigated. Coating modification on LSMM membranes showed an increase in contact angle up to 57% of pure, unmodified PVDF/PEG membranes, which made the fabricated membranes at least passable when hydrophobicity was considered as one main characteristic. Furthermore, The PVDF/PEG/4LSMM-BSMM membrane exhibits 161 \u00b0C of melting point as characterized by the DSC. This value indicates an improvement of thermal behavior shows so as the fabricated membranes are desirable for membrane distillation operation conditions range.

During the past decades, nanoscale ferroelectric characterization has mainly relied on the Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) invented in 1992, however, the fundamental limitations of PFM have made the nanoscale ferroelectric studies encounter significant bottlenecks. In this study, a high-resolution non-contact ferroelectric measurement, named Non-Contact Heterodyne Electrostrain Force Microscopy (NC-HEsFM), is introduced. It is demonstrated that NC-HEsFM can operate on multiple eigenmodes to perform ideal high-resolution ferroelectric domain mapping, standard ferroelectric hysteresis loop measurement, and controllable domain manipulation. By using a quartz tuning fork (QTF) sensor, multi-frequency operation, and heterodyne detection schemes, NC-HEsFM achieves a real non-contact yet non-destructive ferroelectric characterization with negligible electrostatic force effect and hence breaks the fundamental limitations of the conventional PFM. It is believed that NC-HEsFM can be extensively used in various ferroelectric or piezoelectric studies with providing substantially improved characterization performance. Meanwhile, the QTF-based force detection makes NC-HEsFM highly compatible for high-vacuum and low-temperature environments, providing ideal conditions for investigating the intrinsic ferroelectric phenomena with the possibility of achieving an atomically resolved ferroelectric characterization.", "journal": "Small methods", "date": "2021-12-21", "authors": ["QibinZeng", "QichengHuang", "HongliWang", "CaiwenLi", "ZhenFan", "DeyangChen", "YuanCheng", "KaiyangZeng"], "doi": "10.1002/smtd.202100639"}

In this study, the degradation mechanism of photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) membrane could be adequately explained by exploring the generation pathway of different free radicals. The PEC membrane was prepared by gas phase polymerization of poly (3, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) on non-woven fabric, industrial filter cloth, ceramic membrane and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, respectively. Three-dimensional fluorescence test showed that the optimal degradation of mixed or monomer contamination (bovine serum protein, sodium humate, and sodium alginate) was achieved by modified ceramic membrane under PEC condition. As for self-cleaning experiment, the membrane resistance decreased 65.7% when the reaction conditions changed from dark to PEC for 30\u00a0min.

The sensitivity and specificity of these markers have made them an object of even broader interest for sensitive detection and staging of various cancers. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescence-based, mass-based, and electrochemical-based detections are current techniques for sensing tumor markers.

We present the use of the chameleon, a commercially-available piezoelectric cryogenic electron microscopy plunger, to address complex denaturation in the Neisseria gonorrhoeae class Ia RNR. Here, we characterize the extent of denaturation of the ring-shaped complex following grid preparation using a traditional plunger and using a chameleon with varying dispense-to-plunge times. We also characterize how dispense-to-plunge time influences the amount of protein sample required for grid preparation and preferred orientation of the sample. We demonstrate that the fastest dispense-to-plunge time of 54\u00a0ms is sufficient for generation of a data set that produces a high quality structure, and that a traditional plunging technique or slow chameleon dispense-to-plunge times generate data sets limited in resolution by complex denaturation.

Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a tissue-derived nuclear cytokine from the IL-1 family, has been found abnormally expressed in tumor cells and Fibroblast. However, the role and mechanism of IL-33 in the interaction between gastric cancer (GC) cells and CAFs need investigation. Presently, we inquire into the function of lncRNA NORAD-miR-496 axis-mediated IL-33 in modulating the GC-CAFs interaction. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was adopted to gauge the expression of NORAD, miR-496, and IL-33 in GC tissues and cells, and gain- or loss-of-function assays were conducted to investigate the role of them in GC. A GC cell-CAFs co-culture model was established to explore the interaction between CAFs and GCs. As exhibited, NORAD was up-regulated in GC tissues and cells, while miR-496 was remarkably down-regulated. Overexpressing NORAD substantially promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of GC cells and repressed cell death, while overexpressing miR-496 had the opposite effects. Additionally, NORAD enhanced the IL-33 expression and the release of IL-33 from GC cells. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-496 was a target of NORAD and targeted IL-33. CAFs aggravated the malignant behaviors of GC cells as indicated by both experiments. However, NORAD knockdown in CAFs reversed CAFs-mediated promotive effects on GC cells.

InAs epitaxial quantum dots have recently enabled on-demand generation of entangled photons in this wavelength range. However, time-dependent state evolution, caused by the fine-structure splitting, currently limits the fidelity to a specific entangled state. Here, we show fine-structure suppression for InAs quantum dots using micromachined piezoelectric actuators and demonstrate generation of highly entangled photons at 1550\u2009nm.

This paper introduces a portable device aiming at extracting and analyzing parameters (like timestamp, duration, or latency) from recordings obtained from the monitoring of occlusal activity, throughout a complete sleep cycle. An electronic device embedded in a mid-density medical grade silicon occlusal splint detects the moment in which the subject exerts sustained force, and records the time and length of the event, keeping the device on hold until a new event arises. The electronic device, based on a microcontroller, identifies occlusive events from an array of two piezo-resistive sensors and has a storage capacity of up to 36 hours of continuous activity. The collected data is wirelessly transmitted to an external module that is connected via USB to a PC. In the PC, the data is decoded, processed, analyzed, displayed, and stored in ordered files for case subjects, updating every recorded test for a complete history review.

{"title": "Geometrical Investigation of Piezoelectric Patches for Broadband Energy Harvesting in Non-Deterministic Composite Plates.", "abstract": "Mechanical energy is the most ubiquitous form of energy that can be harvested and converted into useful electrical power. For this reason, the piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs), with their inherent electromechanical coupling and high-power density, have been widely incorporated in many applications to generate power from ambient mechanical vibrations. However, one of the main challenges to the wider adoption of PEHs is how to optimize their design for maximum energy harvesting. In this paper, an investigation was conducted on the energy harvesting from seven piezoelectric patch shapes (differing in the number of edges) when attached to a non-deterministic laminated composite (single/double lamina) plate subjected to change in fiber orientation. The performance of the PEHs was examined through a coupled-field finite element (FE) model. The plate was simply supported, and its dynamics were randomized by attaching randomly distributed point masses on the plate surface in addition to applying randomly located time-harmonic point forces. The randomization of point masses and point force location on a thin plate produce non-deterministic response. The design optimization was performed by employing the ensemble-responses of the electrical potential developed across the electrodes of the piezoelectric patches. The results present the optimal fiber orientation and patch shape for maximum energy harvesting in the case of single and double lamina composite plates. The results show that the performance is optimal at 0\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 fiber orientation for single-lamina, and at 0\u00b0/0\u00b0 and 0\u00b0/90\u00b0 fiber orientations for double-lamina composites. For frequencies below 25 Hz, patches with a low number of edges exhibited a higher harvesting performance (triangular for single-lamina/quadrilateral for double-lamina). As for the broadband frequencies (above 25 Hz), the performance was optimal for the patches with a higher number of edges (dodecagonal for single-lamina/octagonal for double-lamina).", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["Asan G AMuthalif", "AbdelrahmanAli", "JamilRenno", "Azni NWahid", "Khairul A MNor", "Nor Hidayati DiyanaNordin"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14237370\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073\n10.1016/j.rser.2020.110473\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113871\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2011.09.001\n10.1016/j.rser.2018.09.038\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.012\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/018\n10.12989/sss.2012.10.3.299\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.06.001\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105567\n10.1007/s12541-013-0226-4\n10.1007/s12206-011-0910-1\n10.1007/s00158-013-0889-6\n10.1007/s11431-014-5556-7\n10.1007/s12206-014-0925-5\n10.1007/s00542-016-2848-9\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00377\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.076\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113443\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112488\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115521\n10.21595/jve.2019.20865\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.10.012\n10.1016/j.jsv.2012.02.012\n10.1121/1.2739420\n10.1016/j.jsv.2012.08.020\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2010.07.012\n10.1007/978-94-011-4489-6\n10.1080/19475411.2018.1439850\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.10.011\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.07.045\n10.3390/en13010223"}
{"title": "Assessment of Polymer Concrete Sample Geometry Effect on Ultrasonic Wave Velocity and Spectral Characteristics.", "abstract": "In this paper an analysis of the influence of polymer concrete sample shape and dimensions on ultrasonic wave propagation is carried out. Compositions of tested fly ash polymer concretes were determined using a material optimization approach. The tests were carried out on the samples of three shapes: cubes, beams, and plates. The ultrasonic testing was done by a direct method (transmission method) using a digital ultrasonic flow detector and piezoelectric transducers of 100 kHz central frequency. Propagation of the ultrasonic wave was characterized by pulse velocity. Frequency spectra and time-frequency spectrograms obtained using Fourier transform and Fourier-based synchrosqueezing transform were also presented. The correlation analysis showed that neither the path length nor the lateral dimension to the direction of wave propagation are not statistically significant for the UPV variability. However, a general trend of decrease in the UPV with increasing the path length was noticed. The analysis of the signal in time-frequency domain seemed to be useful in the analysis of particulate composites properties, especially when UPV changes are not clear enough, since it revealed greater differences in relation to changes in sample geometry than frequency spectra analysis.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["KamilZalegowski"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14237200\n10.1515/ace-2017-0017\n10.3390/ma12193237\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.10.047\n10.1016/j.ijprt.2016.08.003\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.08.102\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.06.060\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2006.02.017\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.12.064\n10.1016/j.cscm.2020.e00335\n10.2478/ace-2018-0017\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/113001\n10.1080/19648189.2018.1528890\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.687.359\n10.1134/S1061830917020024\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.06.231\n10.1016/j.proeng.2013.04.136\n10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.02.011\n10.3390/app10020706\n10.3390/app7121249\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.05.001\n10.1007/BF02472237\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117054\n10.1590/s1983-41952020000200004\n10.35784/bud-arch.1886\n10.1098/rsta.2015.0205\n10.1016/j.crhy.2019.07.001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.07.009\n10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.07.024"}
{"title": "An Experimental Study of Damage Detection on Typical Joints of Jackets Platform Based on Electro-Mechanical Impedance Technique.", "abstract": "Many methods have been used in the past two decades to detect crack damage in steel joints of the offshore structures, but the electromechanical impedance (EMI) method is a comparatively recent non-destructive method that can be used for quality monitoring of the weld in structural steel joints. The EMI method ensures the direct assessment, analysis and particularly the recognition of structural dynamics by acquiring its EM admittance signatures. This research paper first briefly introduces the theoretical background of the EMI method, followed by carrying out the experimental work in which damage in the form of a crack is simulated by using an impedance analyser at different distances. The EMI technique is used to identify the existence of damage in the welded steel joints of offshore steel jacket structures, and Q345B steel was chosen as the material for test in the present study. Sub-millimetre cracks were found in four typical welded steel joints on the jacket platform under circulating loads, and root average variance was used to assess the extent of the crack damage.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["LiaqatAli", "SikandarKhan", "NaveedIqbal", "SalemBashmal", "HamadHameed", "YongBai"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14237168\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.10.046\n10.2514/2.1561\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2010.08.011\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.07.023\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.02.022\n10.1177/1045389X12440754\n10.1002/eqe.72\n10.1016/S0888-3270(03)00081-5\n10.1177/1045389X9500600117\n10.1177/1045389X04039914\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/3/301\n10.1088/0964-1726/9/4/317\n10.1177/104538901320560355\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(182)\n10.29391/2021.100.014\n10.3390/met11081249\n10.1016/j.firesaf.2012.10.008\n10.1016/j.engfailanal.2008.09.016\n10.1515/adms-2016-0003\n10.1016/j.acme.2017.10.001\n10.3390/met8030169\n10.1515/adms-2016-0010\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2017.02.023\n10.1179/1362171815Y.0000000089\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2016.11.002\n10.1515/pomr-2017-0038\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.11.010\n10.1007/s13632-017-0376-3\n10.1515/adms-2017-0036\n10.1515/adms-2015-0015\n10.1080/09507110903464820\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.225\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.597.171\n10.1007/s40194-017-0535-9\n10.1007/s11663-018-1314-8\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.216\n10.1007/s00170-020-05617-y\n10.3390/s21030679\n10.1007/s12665-016-6122-3\n10.1016/j.jcou.2020.101361\n10.1504/IJGW.2018.091532\n10.1016/j.jece.2020.104756\n10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000893\n10.1007/s12665-018-7610-4\n10.1080/17445302.2020.1747751\n10.3390/s21093294\n10.1080/15376494.2021.1980928\n10.3390/w13111554\n10.1115/OMAE2020-19283\n10.1080/17445302.2020.1834268\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.1117/12.175186\n10.1115/1.2888185\n10.1106/QXMV-R3GC-VXXG-W3AQ\n10.1177/104538902761696733\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2009)22:4(373)\n10.1177/1045389X04046309\n10.1007/s10921-019-0603-8\n10.3390/ma13235535\n10.3390/ma13132947\n10.3390/ma14061364"}

To detect damage with fewest sensors and high resolution, a method, using only two piezoelectric transducers and based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) decomposition, was proposed. First, an OMP-based decomposition and dispersion removal algorithm is introduced, which is capable of separating wave packets of different propagation paths and removing the dispersion part successively. Then, two simulation signals, with nonoverlapped and overlapped wave packets, are employed to verify the proposed method.

{"title": "Modeling Magnetostrictive Transducers for Structural Health Monitoring: Ultrasonic Guided Wave Generation and Reception.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic guided waves provide unique capabilities for the structural health monitoring of plate-like structures. They can detect and locate various types of material degradation through the interaction of shear-horizontal (SH) waves and Lamb waves with the material. Magnetostrictive transducers (MSTs) can be used to generate and receive both SH and Lamb waves and yet their characteristics have not been thoroughly studied, certainly not on par with piezoelectric transducers. A series of multiphysics simulations of the MST/plate system is conducted to investigate the characteristics of MSTs that affect guided wave generation and reception. The results are presented in the vein of showing the flexibility that MSTs provide for guided waves in a diverse range of applications. In addition to studying characteristics of the MST components (i.e., the magnetostrictive layer, meander electric coil, and biased magnetic field), single-sided and double-sided MSTs are compared for preferential wave mode generation. The wave mode control principle is based on the activation line for phase velocity dispersion curves, whose slope is the wavelength, which is dictated by the meander coil spacing. A double-sided MST with in-phase signals preferentially excites symmetric SH and Lamb modes, while a double-sided MST with out-of-phase signals preferentially excites antisymmetric SH and Lamb modes. All attempted single-mode actuations with double-sided MSTs were successful, with the SH3 mode actuated at 922 kHz in a 6-mm-thick plate being the highest frequency. Additionally, the results show that increasing the number of turns in the meander coil enhances the sensitivity of the MST as a receiver and substantially reduces the frequency bandwidth.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["GaofengSha", "Cliff JLissenden"], "doi": "10.3390/s21237971\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00038-3\n10.1177/1475921716678921\n10.1016/S0041-624X(01)00064-6\n10.1016/j.jsv.2019.115165\n10.3390/s19132990\n10.3390/s17030488\n10.1080/09349840109409687\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.02.006\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3011226\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2835299\n10.3390/s18030779\n10.1177/1475921718805733\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2005.09.001\n10.1063/1.5100292\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00024-3\n10.1784/insi.2015.57.4.206\n10.1063/5.0038340\n10.3390/app10134479\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.05.015\n10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106355\n10.3390/ma11050755\n10.1002/pssa.2210700228\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2020.166969\n10.1109/TNS.2017.2775163\n10.1016/0304-8853(91)90180-I\n10.12989/sem.2004.17.3_4.303\n10.1016/j.matdes.2006.12.016\n10.1108/03321640910958946\n10.1109/20.952605\n10.1106/MJ6A-FBP9-9M61-0E1F\n10.1038/sdata.2015.53\n10.1007/s10409-005-0028-8\n10.1088/0508-3443/16/9/302\n10.1143/JPSJ.12.981B\n10.1063/1.5006418\n10.1088/1674-1056/21/8/087501\n10.3390/s17010005\n10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108131\n10.3390/ma11030406\n10.1143/JJAP.32.2216\n10.1179/imr.1987.32.1.265"}
{"title": "Influence of Trajectory and Dynamics of Vehicle Motion on Signal Patterns in the WIM System.", "abstract": "This paper presents the analyses of the signals recorded by the main sensors of a WIM test station in the cases of abnormal runs (i.e., runs with the changes of trajectory or the dynamics of vehicle motion). The research involved strain gauges which are used for measuring the weight of vehicles, inductive loops, as well as piezoelectric sensors used, inter alia, to detect twin wheels and to determine where a vehicle passes through a station. Since the designers intend the station to be able to implement the direct enforcement function, the selection of runs deviating from the normative ones constitutes an important issue for the assessment of the measurement reliability. The study considered the location of the trajectory of the runs, the dynamics (acceleration/braking) and the trajectory changes. The change in the amplitude and the value of the signal recorded by the strain gauges as a function of the location (position) of the contact between sensor and tires is a noteworthy observation which indicates the need to monitor this parameter in automatic WIM systems. Other tests also demonstrated the influence of the analysed driving parameters on the recorded results. However, by equipping the WIM station with a set of duplicate strain gauges, the measurement errors of the gross weight and axle loads are normally within the accuracy limits of class A(5) stations. Only in the case of accelerating/decelerating, does the error in measuring the load of a single axle reach several per cent.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["ArturRygu\u0142a", "AndrzejMaczy\u0144ski", "KrzysztofBrzozowski", "MarcinGrygierek", "AleksanderKonior"], "doi": "10.3390/s21237895\n10.2478/ttj-2021-0020\n10.1016/j.aap.2010.12.013\n10.1016/j.envsci.2013.05.004\n10.1007/978-3-319-49646-7_36\n10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.214\n10.3390/infrastructures4020036\n10.1007/978-3-319-66251-0_19\n10.3390/s19092027\n10.3141/1855-19\n10.1007/978-3-319-39639-2_19\n10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005586\n10.1007/978-3-030-59270-7_20\n10.1515/eng-2020-0020"}

{"title": "Biosensors as Nano-Analytical Tools for COVID-19 Detection.", "abstract": "Selective, sensitive and affordable techniques to detect disease and underlying health issues have been developed recently. Biosensors as nanoanalytical tools have taken a front seat in this context. Nanotechnology-enabled progress in the health sector has aided in disease and pandemic management at a very early stage efficiently. This report reflects the state-of-the-art of nanobiosensor-based virus detection technology in terms of their detection methods, targets, limits of detection, range, sensitivity, assay time, etc. The article effectively summarizes the challenges with traditional technologies and newly emerging biosensors, including the nanotechnology-based detection kit for COVID-19; optically enhanced technology; and electrochemical, smart and wearable enabled nanobiosensors.

{"title": "Non-Equilibrium Plasma Methods for Tailoring Surface Properties of Polyvinylidene Fluoride: Review and Challenges.", "abstract": "Modification and functionalization of polymer surface properties is desired in numerous applications, and a standard technique is a treatment with non-equilibrium gaseous plasma. Fluorinated polymers exhibit specific properties and are regarded as difficult to functionalize with polar functional groups. Plasma methods for functionalization of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are reviewed and different mechanisms involved in the surface modification are presented and explained by the interaction of various reactive species and far ultraviolet radiation. Most authors used argon plasma but reported various results. The discrepancy between the reported results is explained by peculiarities of the experimental systems and illustrated by three mechanisms. More versatile reaction mechanisms were reported by authors who used oxygen plasma for surface modification of PVDF, while plasma sustained in other gases was rarely used. The results reported by various authors are analyzed, and correlations are drawn where feasible. The processing parameters reported by different authors were the gas pressure and purity, the discharge configuration and power, while the surface finish was predominantly determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and static water contact angle (WCA). A reasonably good correlation was found between the surface wettability as probed by WCA and the oxygen concentration as probed by XPS, but there is hardly any correlation between the discharge parameters and the wettability.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["AlenkaVesel", "RokZaplotnik", "GregorPrimc", "MiranMozeti\u010d", "TadejaKatan", "RupertKargl", "TamilselvanMohan", "Karin StanaKleinschek"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13234243\n10.1021/am401462e\n10.1021/ie4042388\n10.1038/s41598-017-02605-3\n10.1002/jbm.a.34251\n10.3390/membranes10060121\n10.1016/S0141-3910(97)00130-4\n10.1063/1.3373587\n10.1063/1.2821226\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147356\n10.1016/S0032-3861(02)00872-8\n10.1021/acsanm.0c00618\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150058\n10.1039/C7RA11904F\n10.1016/j.polymer.2014.04.029\n10.3144/expresspolymlett.2015.2\n10.1002/ppap.201400166\n10.1088/1361-6463/aab3ad\n10.1351/pac200577020487\n10.3390/polym12051028\n10.1002/sia.2255\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.07.036\n10.3390/polym12102295\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2015.03.019\n10.1557/jmr.2020.302\n10.1016/j.desal.2016.09.001\n10.1088/1361-6595/abb5e7\n10.1002/ppap.202100061\n10.1088/0022-3727/44/32/325203\n10.1088/1361-6463/aad82b\n10.1088/0963-0252/20/3/035006\n10.1016/j.nanoso.2019.100268\n10.1016/j.chemphys.2011.03.015\n10.1016/j.surfin.2020.100900\n10.1016/S0257-8972(99)00268-6\n10.1002/ppap.200500010\n10.3390/coatings9020145\n10.3390/polym11020202\n10.1016/S0039-6028(02)01367-5\n10.3390/polym12112498"}

The understanding of subtle transitions or multistep phase transformation requires real-time phenomenological studies using a multi-technique approach that covers several length-scales and chemical states. A combination of X-ray scattering techniques with Raman spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry was conducted to correlate the structural changes from the conformational chain to the polymer crystal and mesoscale organization. Current research applications and the experimental combination of Raman spectroscopy with simultaneous SAXS/WAXS measurements coupled to a DSC is discussed. In particular, we show that in order to obtain the maximum benefit from simultaneously obtained high-quality data sets from different techniques, one should look beyond traditional analysis techniques and instead apply multivariate analysis. Data mining strategies can be applied to develop methods to control polymer processing in an industrial context.

{"title": "Inner Surface Hydrophilic Modification of PVDF Membrane with Tea Polyphenols/Silica Composite Coating.", "abstract": "The use of Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes is constrained in wastewater treatment because of their hydrophobic nature. Therefore, a large number of researchers have been working on the hydrophilic modification of their surfaces. In this work, a superhydrophilic tea polyphenols/silica composite coating was developed by a one-step process. The composite coating can achieve not only superhydrophilic modification of the surface, but also the inner surface of the porous PVDF membrane, which endows the modified membrane with excellent water permeability. The modified membrane possesses ultrahigh water flux (15,353 L\u00b7m", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["QiangXu", "XiaoliJi", "JiayingTian", "XiaogangJin", "LiliWu"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13234186\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.08.058\n10.1016/j.cherd.2009.10.009\n10.1016/j.cej.2021.129123\n10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62257-3\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.11.019\n10.1016/S0376-7388(98)00190-2\n10.1016/j.cej.2015.08.141\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.10.027\n10.1016/j.desal.2007.10.042\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.04.036\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.01.028\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.04.110\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2019.100941\n10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.114\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118119\n10.1021/acsami.9b04961\n10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.050\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.118068\n10.1016/j.polymer.2015.09.024\n10.1021/acsami.9b15811\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.033\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.11.022\n10.1021/acsami.8b15883\n10.1002/pen.23903\n10.1002/pen.25289\n10.1016/j.coco.2019.06.009\n10.1038/srep02776\n10.1021/acsnano.5b03791\n10.1016/j.cej.2017.03.106\n10.1021/ja311374b\n10.1016/j.cis.2018.06.001\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.11.033\n10.1039/C5GC00381D\n10.1039/C6RA13634F\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.06.131\n10.1021/acsami.0c18825\n10.1016/j.seppur.2021.118660"}
{"title": "Icephobic and Anticorrosion Coatings Deposited by Electrospinning on Aluminum Alloys for Aerospace Applications.", "abstract": "Anti-icing or passive strategies have undergone a remarkable growth in importance as a complement for the de-icing approaches or active methods. As a result, many efforts for developing icephobic surfaces have been mostly dedicated to apply superhydrophobic coatings. Recently, a different type of ice-repellent structure based on slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) has attracted increasing attention for being a simple and effective passive ice protection in a wide range of application areas, especially for the prevention of ice formation on aircrafts. In this work, the electrospinning technique has been used for the deposition of PVDF-HFP coatings on samples of the aeronautical alloy AA7075 by using a thickness control system based on the identification of the proper combination of process parameters such as the flow rate and applied voltage. In addition, the influence of the experimental conditions on the nanofiber properties is evaluated in terms of surface morphology, wettability, corrosion resistance, and optical transmittance. The experimental results showed an improvement in the micro/nanoscale structure, which optimizes the superhydrophobic and anticorrosive behavior due to the air trapped inside the nanotextured surface. In addition, once the best coating was selected, centrifugal ice adhesion tests (CAT) were carried out for two types of icing conditions (glaze and rime) simulated in an ice wind tunnel (IWT) on both as-deposited and liquid-infused coatings (SLIPs). The liquid-infused coatings showed a low water adhesion (low contact angle hysteresis) and low ice adhesion strength, reducing the ice adhesion four times with respect to PTFE (a well-known low-ice-adhesion material used as a reference).", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-12-11", "authors": ["Adri\u00e1nVicente", "Pedro JRivero", "PalomaGarc\u00eda", "JulioMora", "FranciscoCarre\u00f1o", "Jos\u00e9 FPalacio", "RafaelRodr\u00edguez"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13234164\n10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.10.001\n10.1163/016942411X574592\n10.1016/S0169-8095(97)00057-4\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.125441\n10.1021/la3018453\n10.1002/polb.23070\n10.1039/tf9444000546\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2016.07.074\n10.1021/ar040224c\n10.1002/adma.201002689\n10.1126/science.1207115\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2011.02.057\n10.1039/c3ra40497h\n10.1021/la803860d\n10.1021/acsami.5b00558\n10.1073/pnas.0405885101\n10.1038/nature10447\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.09.019\n10.1002/adfm.201505522\n10.1016/S0169-8095(97)00051-3\n10.1163/016942409X12510925843078\n10.1016/S0376-0421(01)00018-5\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2010.11.049\n10.1021/la902882b\n10.4236/msa.2013.46045\n10.1002/admi.201700552\n10.1002/admi.201701479\n10.1016/j.corsci.2015.01.015\n10.1039/C7TB02457F\n10.1021/am404077h\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.02.051\n10.1039/C2TA00189F\n10.3390/polym13030464\n10.3390/polym12092086\n10.3390/coatings9060367\n10.1016/j.nantod.2011.08.004\n10.1088/0957-4484/7/3/009\n10.1002/adma.200400719\n10.3390/met10030350\n10.1016/j.prostr.2016.06.380\n10.1016/0261-3069(88)90076-3\n10.1002/celc.201900302\n10.1021/acsami.6b03961\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2014.06.031\n10.1080/02670836.2018.1560985\n10.1016/j.apmt.2020.100815\n10.3390/coatings10070636\n10.1063/1.1384013\n10.1016/S0032-3861(01)00540-7\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.11.007\n10.1002/pi.4314\n10.1002/jbm.b.30041\n10.1021/bm049759j\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.11.036\n10.1007/BF03218855\n10.1007/978-3-319-25214-8\n10.1016/S0032-3861(01)00671-1\n10.1016/j.crci.2019.10.007\n10.1021/am501539b\n10.1002/app.32404\n10.1021/la2014978\n10.1002/adma.200400315\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.124177\n10.1039/C2SM27032C\n10.1038/natrevmats.2015.3\n10.1098/rsta.2000.0690\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2018.03.001\n10.1063/1.5086242\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.126971\n10.1126/sciadv.1501496"}

{"title": "Shaping in the Third Direction; Synthesis of Patterned Colloidal Crystals by Polyester Fabric-Guided Self-Assembly.", "abstract": "A polyester fabric with rectangular openings was used as a sacrificial template for the guiding of a sub-micron sphere (polystyrene (PS) and silica) aqueous colloid self-assembly process during evaporation as a patterned colloidal crystal (PCC). This simple process is also a robust one, being less sensitive to external parameters (ambient pressure, temperature, humidity, vibrations). The most interesting feature of the concave-shape-pattern unit cell (350 \u03bcm \u00d7 400 \u03bcm \u00d7 3 \u03bcm) of this crystal is the presence of triangular prisms at its border, each prism having a one-dimensional sphere array at its top edge. The high-quality ordered single layer found inside of each unit cell presents the super-prism effect and left-handed behavior. Wider yet elongated deposits with ordered walls and disordered top surfaces were formed under the fabric knots. Rectangular patterning was obtained even for 20 \u03bcm PS spheres.

At these length scales, contributions of SAWs to the electrical double layer (EDL) of ions and of the latter to particulates and flow may become appreciable. However, the nature of the interplay between SAWs and EDLs is unknown. We demonstrate the contribution of a SAW to the near-equilibrium electrical and ion-concentration fields in an EDL near inert and piezoelectric substrates. In particular, we concentrate on the leakage of transient and steady components of electrical potential through the excited EDL. Far from the solid, the leakage may be interpreted by different models of the EDL to give information about the EDL characteristic relaxation time, \u03b6-potential, and the Stern layer therein.

{"title": "Effects of transcranial ultrasound stimulation pulsed at 40\u00a0Hz on A\u03b2 plaques and brain rhythms in 5\u00d7FAD mice.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and is characterized by amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and tauopathy. Reducing A\u03b2 has been considered a major AD treatment strategy in pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Impairment of gamma oscillations, which play an important role in perception and cognitive function, has been shown in mouse AD models and human patients. Recently, the therapeutic effect of gamma entrainment in AD mouse models has been reported. Given that ultrasound is an emerging neuromodulation modality, we investigated the effect of ultrasound stimulation pulsed at gamma frequency (40\u00a0Hz) in an AD mouse model.\nWe implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes and a piezo-ceramic disc ultrasound transducer on the skull surface of 6-month-old 5\u00d7FAD\u00a0and wild-type control mice (n\u2009=\u200912 and 6, respectively). Six 5\u00d7FAD\u00a0mice were treated with two-hour ultrasound stimulation at 40\u00a0Hz daily for two weeks, and the other six mice received sham treatment. Soluble and insoluble A\u03b2 levels in the brain were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spontaneous EEG gamma power was computed by wavelet analysis, and the brain connectivity was examined with phase-locking value and cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling.\nWe found that the total A\u03b242 levels, especially insoluble A\u03b242, in the treatment group decreased in pre- and infra-limbic cortex (PIL) compared to that of the sham treatment group. A reduction in the number of A\u03b2 plaques was also observed in the hippocampus. There was no increase in microbleeding in the transcranial ultrasound stimulation (tUS) group. In addition, the length and number of microglial processes decreased in PIL and hippocampus. Encelphalographic spontaneous gamma power was increased, and cross-frequency coupling was normalized, implying functional improvement after tUS stimulation.\nThese results suggest that the transcranial ultrasound-based gamma-band entrainment technique can be an effective therapy for AD by reducing the A\u03b2 load and improving brain connectivity.", "journal": "Translational neurodegeneration", "date": "2021-12-08", "authors": ["MincheolPark", "Gia MinhHoang", "ThienNguyen", "EunkyungLee", "Hyun JinJung", "YoungshikChoe", "Moon HwanLee", "Jae YounHwang", "Jae GwanKim", "TaeKim"], "doi": "10.1186/s40035-021-00274-x\n10.1002/alz.12366\n10.1109/TBME.2021.3085170"}

{"title": "A Novel Broadband Forcecardiography Sensor for Simultaneous Monitoring of Respiration, Infrasonic Cardiac Vibrations and Heart Sounds.", "abstract": "The precordial mechanical vibrations generated by cardiac contractions have a rich frequency spectrum. While the lowest frequencies can be palpated, the higher infrasonic frequencies are usually captured by the seismocardiogram (SCG) signal and the audible ones correspond to heart sounds. Forcecardiography (FCG) is a non-invasive technique that measures these vibrations via force sensing resistors (FSR). This study presents a new piezoelectric sensor able to record all heart vibrations simultaneously, as well as a respiration signal. The new sensor was compared to the FSR-based one to assess its suitability for FCG. An electrocardiogram (ECG) lead and a signal from an electro-resistive respiration band (ERB) were synchronously acquired as references on six healthy volunteers (4 males, 2 females) at rest. The raw signals from the piezoelectric and the FSR-based sensors turned out to be very similar. The raw signals were divided into four components: Forcerespirogram (FRG), Low-Frequency FCG (LF-FCG), High-Frequency FCG (HF-FCG) and heart sounds (HS-FCG). A beat-by-beat comparison of FCG and ECG signals was carried out by means of regression, correlation and Bland-Altman analyses, and similarly for respiration signals (FRG and ERB). The results showed that the infrasonic FCG components are strongly related to the cardiac cycle (", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2021-12-07", "authors": ["EmilioAndreozzi", "Gaetano DGargiulo", "DanieleEsposito", "PaoloBifulco"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2021.725716\n10.3390/s21123996\n10.3390/s20143885\n10.15406/jabb.2018.05.00165\n10.1136/hrt.24.5.581\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1186/1476-7120-5-42\n10.1109/iembs.2011.6091063\n10.1109/jbhi.2018.2829608\n10.1109/lsp.2018.2801341\n10.1007/s10916-009-9380-8\n10.1159/000470156\n10.3390/s19163472\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01057\n10.1088/1361-6579/ab87b2\n10.3390/s20030680\n10.1161/01.cir.8.2.269\n10.3390/s18082553\n10.3389/fnbot.2019.00114\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq030\n10.1038/s41746-020-0225-7\n10.5405/jmbe.847\n10.1002/advs.201900290\n10.3390/s21030815\n10.1186/s12938-020-00837-5\n10.1109/jbhi.2014.2361732\n10.1186/s13634-018-0545-9\n10.1155/2014/690124\n10.1038/s41598-017-07248-y\n10.3109/03091902.2016.1139203\n10.1109/tbme.2016.2600945\n10.3390/s20061583\n10.1109/tbme.2016.2616382\n10.1038/srep31297\n10.1007/BF00787321\n10.1038/s41551-019-0480-6\n10.3390/s18103441\n10.1109/jbhi.2016.2620496\n10.1126/sciadv.1601185\n10.1159/000410758\n10.3390/s18041067\n10.1109/tim.2019.2908511\n10.1088/1361-6579/abc0b7\n10.1073/pnas.1920911117\n10.1088/0967-3334/33/10/1643\n10.3390/ma10111334\n10.3390/s17092108\n10.1109/jbhi.2015.2391437\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00165\n10.1007/s13755-019-0071-7\n10.1021/ac60214a047\n10.21105/joss.00671\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.05.014\n10.1109/jbhi.2019.2895775\n10.3390/s20226675\n10.1038/s41598-018-33675-6\n10.1016/0002-9149(58)90271-6\n10.15406/jabb.2017.02.00024\n10.3390/vibration2010005\n10.3390/app7070690\n10.1109/jsen.2016.2573269\n10.1109/tbme.2018.2856700\n10.1109/JBHI.2017.2764798\n10.1109/jsen.2017.2663420\n10.3390/s20061596\n10.1088/1361-6579/ab6f53\n10.1109/jbhi.2020.2980979\n10.1109/jbhi.2019.2931348\n10.1109/TBME.2020.3014040"}

To address this issue, clinicians often use electrical stimulation to improve surgery success rates and decrease healing time in patients with increased risk of pseudarthrosis, including smokers and diabetics. Current invasive electrical stimulation devices require an implantable battery and a second surgery for removal. Piezoelectric composites within an interbody implant generate sufficient power under physiologic loads to deliver pulsed electrical stimulation without a battery and have demonstrated promising preclinical bone growth and fusion success. The objective of the current study was to assess the power generation and fatigue resistance of three commercially manufactured piezocomposite configurations in a modified implant design to demonstrate efficacy as a robust biomaterial within osteogenic implants. The three configurations were electromechanically assessed under physiological lumbar loading conditions, and all configurations produced sufficient power to promote bone healing. Additionally, electrical and mechanical fatigue performance was assessed under high load, low cycle conditions. All configurations demonstrated runout with no gross mechanical failure and two configurations demonstrated electrical fatigue resistance. Future piezoelectric implant design decisions should be based on power generation needs to stimulate bone growth, as mechanical fatigue efficacy was proven for all piezocomposite configurations tested.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2021-12-06", "authors": ["Ember DKrech", "Leighton JLaPierre", "SafakcanTuncdemir", "A ErkanGurdal", "Evan GHaas", "Paul MArnold", "Elizabeth AFriis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104976\n10.1016/jjbiomech.2017.08.020\n10.14444/4029\n10.2106/JBJS.K.01344\n10.2337/diacare.24.ll.1936\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e31814blbc0\n10.1002/jbm.a.36767\n10.3390/bioengineering5040090\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2011-200180\n10.1002/jor.1100070309\n10.1016/j.spinee.2014.ll.004\n10.3390/ijerphl5122845\n10.1142/S0217979217410119\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.09.015\n10.1007/s00586-006-0087-y\n10.1111/j.1574-695X.1999.tb01397.x\n10.1002/jbm.b.33365\n10.1177/002199803029731\n10.1016/B978-0-12-379550-2.50016-8\n10.1016/S0142-1123(98)00029-2\n10.1115/SMASIS2018-8043\n10.1016/jjmbbm.2018.08.027\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.07.013\n10.1109/ISWC.1998.729539\n10.1002/jbm.b.32669\n10.1063/L4900845\n10.3389/fendo.2018.00006\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e318145a56a\n10.1016/jjbiomech.2018.07.022\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab85a5\n10.1109/TMECH.2005.844704\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.11.032\n10.1053/jjfas.2005.07.018\n10.1016/S0142-1123(00)00052-9\n10.1007/sl0832-007-9411-0"}

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB)/poly-\u03b2-alanine (PBA) fibrous tissue scaffolds with piezoelectric properties for skeletal muscle regeneration. Random and aligned P3HB/PBA (5:1) fibrous matrices were prepared by electrospinning with average diameters of 951\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0153\u00a0nm and 891\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0247\u00a0nm, respectively.

Herein, an imidazole-functionalized graphene oxide (Im-GO) with hydrophilicity and antibacterial performance was synthesized, and it was used as a modifier to improve the anti-organic fouling and antibacterial properties of PVDF membrane. The anti-organic fouling test showed that the maximum flux recovery ratios against bovine serum albumin and humic acid were 88.9% and 94.5%, respectively. Conspicuously, the grafted imidazole groups could effectively prevent the bacteria from growing on the membrane surface. It was gratifying that the antibacterial modifier Im-GO was almost not lost from the hybrid membranes even by the ultrasonic treatment, which was different from the conventional release-killing antibacterial agents.

{"title": "C. elegans PEZO-1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel involved in food sensation.", "abstract": "PIEZO channels are force sensors essential for physiological processes, including baroreception and proprioception. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes an orthologue gene of the Piezo family, pezo-1, which is expressed in several tissues, including the pharynx. This myogenic pump is an essential component of the C. elegans alimentary canal, whose contraction and relaxation are modulated by mechanical stimulation elicited by food content. Whether pezo-1 encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel and contributes to pharyngeal function remains unknown. Here, we leverage genome editing, genetics, microfluidics, and electropharyngeogram recording to establish that pezo-1 is expressed in the pharynx, including in a proprioceptive-like neuron, and regulates pharyngeal function. Knockout (KO) and gain-of-function (GOF) mutants reveal that pezo-1 is involved in fine-tuning pharyngeal pumping frequency, as well as sensing osmolarity and food mechanical properties. Using pressure-clamp experiments in primary C. elegans embryo cultures, we determine that pezo-1 KO cells do not display mechanosensitive currents, whereas cells expressing wild-type or GOF PEZO-1 exhibit mechanosensitivity. Moreover, infecting the Spodoptera frugiperda cell line with a baculovirus containing the G-isoform of pezo-1 (among the longest isoforms) demonstrates that pezo-1 encodes a mechanosensitive channel.

{"title": "Sensitivity of an infinite-strip-shaped polyvinylidene fluoride film in an underwater plane sound field.", "abstract": "The sensitivity of an infinite-strip-shaped polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film in an underwater plane sound field is analyzed in this paper. The high-frequency sensitivity is characterized by the resonances of the symmetrical in-plane stress modes with traction-free boundary conditions at the ends of the film and by the anti-resonances due to the superposition of the stress components. The low-frequency sensitivity exhibits a simple hydrostatic response. The directional property of the in-plane stress component, generated by the incident sound across the thickness, has two contributions. The first is from the aperture and dipolar functions of the incident sound pressure over the PVDF surfaces and at the two ends of the film. The second is from an amplitude modulation by an angle-dependent gain. The directional property of the in-plane stress component by the sound pressure at the two ends of the film is only controlled by the dipolar function, and that of the stress component in the thickness direction is only determined by the aperture function. The illustration of the frequency and directional features of the PVDF film may advance understanding of the mechanisms involved in generating the voltage output of PVDF by an incident sound field.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2021-12-03", "authors": ["JiePan", "NingWang", "DavidMatthews"], "doi": "10.1121/10.0006778"}
{"title": "Ultra-wide operation band of the high-frequency underwater acoustic transducer realized by two-layer 1-3 piezoelectric composite.", "abstract": "In this paper, the two-layer 1-3 composite transducer using an unconventional part-excitation method is presented to achieve the ultra-wide operation band for the high-frequency underwater devices, in which the part-excitation refers to the method that only the lower-layer is excited, while the upper-layer in contact with the propagation medium is not excited. This method is first proposed by analyzing the longitudinal vibration modes of one piezoelectric rod in the 1-3 composite and finally, we conclude that if the excited lower-layer can be controlled to have thickness given by 3l/2n, where l is the whole thickness of the two-layer rod and n (n\u2009>\u20091) denotes the number of the coupled modes, then first n order modes can be activated simultaneously to form an ultra-wide operation band containing n response peaks. Finite element method (FEM) is employed to investigate the two-layer 1-3 composite with a thickness of 10\u2009mm. The results show that when the thickness of the excited lower-layer is 3\u2009mm (n = 5), the transducer attains the ultra-wideband by coupling five resonances, nearly covering the frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. According to the difference of response level, the whole band can be divided into multiple local wide bands.

Moreover, in view of the rate dependence and asymmetry of piezoelectric hysteresis, and the complex inversion process of the generalized Bouc-Wen hysteresis model, the Hammerstein dynamic inverse hysteresis model of the piezoelectric actuator is established. To be specific, the static nonlinearity and rate dependence of the piezoelectric inverse hysteresis are represented by the generalized Bouc-Wen inverse model and the auto-regressive exogenous model, respectively, and the parameters of the model are identified by the adaptive beetle swarm optimization algorithm. In the process of the open-loop feedforward compensation, the dynamic positioning accuracy of the piezoelectric actuator is greatly affected by various disturbances and the uncertainty of the hysteresis compensation model. In this context, a compound control strategy that combines the feedforward compensation with the single-neuron adaptive proportion-integration-differentiation control is proposed based on the Hammerstein dynamic inverse hysteresis model of the piezoelectric actuator.

Pain occurrence was increased by 14.79% in patients with more than one stone at the time of SWL and by 3.21% in those who were managed with a piezoelectric lithotripter.\nSWL should not be considered an uneventful procedure, as in 2.5% of cases an intervention or Clavien III-V complication will be observed. Low-volume centers, treatment of multiple or complex stones, a long-lasting SWL session, and electrohydraulic lithotripters are associated with higher rates of complications.\nWe analyze the occurrence of shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) complications in 17000 patients. In centers with larger caseloads, complications were less common. The type of lithotripter is associated with complications. An increased number of treated stones, complex stones, and increased SWL duration were associated with a higher incidence of pain and hematuria.", "journal": "European urology focus", "date": "2021-12-02", "authors": ["LazarosTzelves", "RobertGeraghty", "PanagiotisMourmouris", "NikolaosChatzikrachtis", "MarkosKaravitakis", "BhaskarSomani", "AndreasSkolarikos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.euf.2021.11.002"}

The main element of the system was a piezoelectric resonator excited by a lateral electric field based on an X-cut lithium niobate plate 0.5\u00a0mm thick with two rectangular electrodes on one side. On the other side of the resonator, there was a 1.5\u00a0ml liquid container. As a sensory element we used Escherichia coli B-878 microbial cells, which are sensitive to kanamycin. For measurement 1\u00a0ml of this cells suspension was placed in a liquid container and then the test liquid in the amount of 2\u00a0\u03bcl containing kanamycin was added. The change in the real part of the electrical impedance of the resonator before and after the test liquid addition was used as an analytical signal which indicated the presence of kanamycin. The lower limit of determination of kanamycin turned out to be 1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml with an analysis time of 10\u00a0min.

{"title": "Dual Interface Protection for High Performance and Excellent Long-Term Stability of Organic Solar Cells.", "abstract": "Stability is still the main barrier to the commercial application of organic solar cells (OSCs), although the maximal power conversion efficiency (PCE) value has exceeded 19%. The encapsulation technique is an effective and vital way to guarantee the long-term stabilities of OSCs, but it can only avoid the penetration of water and oxygen from the environment. Herein, we introduced a structure that provides dual interface protection by using commercially available and chemically stable polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the cathode interface protection layer working as the cathode interlayer (CIL) and poly(styrene-comethyl-methacrylate) (PS-r-PMMA) as the anode interface protection layer between the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and the active layer. With this structure, both the migration of impurities caused by degradation of the interfacial layer and the infiltration of oxygen and water in the air can be prevented. PVDF can effectively provide optimal electron transfer by improving the surface potential of active layers and lowering the work function of the Al electrode. PS-r-PMMA can improve the hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS and induce optimized phase separation, facilitating charge transfer. After storage in an air environment with a humidity of approximately 60% for 3600 h, the device based on the PM6:IT-4F blend film with dual interface protection showed a decrease in its PCE value from 13.43 to 10.90%, retaining 81.2% of its original PCE value, in contrast to the sharp decrease in the PCE value from 13.66 to 0.74% of the device without dual interface protection. The dual interface protection design could also be useful in the high-performance PM6:Y6 system, which shows a champion PCE of 15.39% and shows potential for the effective fabrication of stable OSCs in the future.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2021-11-30", "authors": ["YansongGe", "XinyuXiao", "GeYao", "ShuaishuaiYuan", "LinZhang", "WeihuaZhou"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.1c15792"}

As there is little experience with the tapes so far and literature is scanty, the aim of this study was to investigate biomechanical properties for the fixation of the PVDF-tapes with three different fixation methods in context of apical fixations.\nEvaluation was performed on porcine, fresh cadaver sacral spines. A total of 40 trials, divided into 4 subgroups, was performed on the anterior longitudinal ligament. Recorded biomechanical properties were displacement at failure, maximum load and stiffness in terms of the primary endpoints. The failure mode was a secondary endpoint. Group 4 was a reference group to compare single sutures on porcine tissue with those on human tissue. Biomechanical parameters for single sutures on the human anterior longitudinal ligament were evaluated in a previous work by Hachenberg et al. RESULTS: The maximum load for group 1 (two single sutures) was 65\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0N, for group 2 (three titanium tacks arranged in a row) it was 25\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0N and for group 3 (three titanium tacks arranged in a triangle) it was 38\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0N. There was a significant difference between all three groups. The most common failure mode was a \"mesh failure\" in 9/10 trials for groups 1-3.\nThe PVDF-tape fixation with two single sutures endures 2.6 times more load than titanium tacks arranged in a row and 1.7 times more load than titanium tacks arranged in a triangle.

Although several heterojunction catalysts have been applied to improve the sonophotocatalytic capability, the importance of the morphology on the sonophotocatalytic capability has not been emphasized. In this study, brush-like ZnO nanorod arrays are synthesized on a stainless-steel mesh and subsequently vulcanized into ZnO/ZnS core-shell nanorod arrays to investigate the sonophotocatalytic capability of the heterojunction.

Afterward, the ZnO/ZnS nanorods are etched to ZnO/ZnS nanotubes without affecting the crystallography and distribution of the ZnS nanoparticle shell, further improving the capability to 63.3%. The improvement can be ascribed to the coupling effect of the enhanced piezoelectric field and the reduced migration distance, which suppresses the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs while transforming the morphology from nanorod to nanotube, as proven by the electron spin resonance test and numerical simulations.

{"title": "Effect of Point Defects on Electronic Structure of Monolayer GeS.", "abstract": "Using density functional theory calculations, atomic and electronic structure of defects in monolayer GeS were investigated by focusing on the effects of vacancies and substitutional atoms. We chose group IV or chalcogen elements as substitutional ones, which substitute for Ge or S in GeS. It was found that the bandgap of GeS with substitutional atoms is close to that of pristine GeS, while the bandgap of GeS with Ge or S vacancies was smaller than that of pristine GeS. In terms of formation energy, monolayer GeS with Ge vacancies is more stable than that with S vacancies, and notably GeS with Ge substituted with Sn is most favorable within the range of chemical potential considered. Defects affect the piezoelectric properties depending on vacancies or substitutional atoms. Especially, GeS with substitutional atoms has almost the same piezoelectric stress coefficients eij as pristine GeS while having lower piezoelectric strain coefficients dij&nbsp; but still much higher than other 2D materials.

{"title": "Analysis of the Piezoelectric Properties of Aligned Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes.", "abstract": "Recent studies reveal that carbon nanostructures show anomalous piezoelectric properties when the central symmetry of their structure is violated.

{"title": "The Staircase Drive-A Novel Actuator Design Optimised for Daisy-Chaining and Minimum Stress Load Coupling.", "abstract": "This work presents a novel type of actuator that improves over the standard cantilever by permitting daisy-chaining while minimising stress to the joint connecting to the load. A detailed structural and functional comparison of the proposed device against the cantilever actuator as a baseline is given, led by a brief revision of the cantilever actuator as the state-of-the-art that highlights its limitations with respect to daisy-chaining and the stress it inherently creates within the joint connecting to the load when attempting out-of-plane displacement without rotation. Simulations of both devices' performance confirm that the newly proposed device yields the targeted displacement profile that both enables the daisy-chaining of such a device into a higher-order actuator for increased displacement and reduce stress in the joint with the load. This comes at the cost of reduced maximum displacement compared to the cantilever, which can be overcome by daisy-chaining. The proposed device's performance is further evaluated on the basis of manufactured prototypes measured by means of a laser scanning vibrometer.

{"title": "Extended PKM Fixturing System for Micro-Positioning and Vibration Rejection in Machining Application.", "abstract": "The paper aims to present a mechatronic device able to micro-position the workpiece and to reject disturbances due to machining operation. A decoupling method is proposed for a parallel kinematic machine (PKM) fixturing platform composed by a 3-DoF flexure-based piezo-actuated mechanism. The parallel platform, with a vertical motion and two rotations, is described and its kinematics and dynamics are studied. The coupling undesirable effect is investigated based on a set of poses. To improve the quasi-static regulator model for a set-point following system, a bump less switching controller and a fine-tuning procedure, to estimate the parameter uncertainty and enable the external disturbance containment in an extended broadband frequency range, are presented. The platform and the piezo-actuator controllers are modelled based on a gain scheduling, standard ISA form method, to guarantee the stability.

Factors such as stress distribution, load resistance, loads, and loading times influencing the piezoelectric properties were investigated using theoretical analysis and experimental tests. The results show that the unit number has a negative relationship with the generated energy and the stress distribution has no influence on the power generation of the piezoelectric unit array. However, with a small stress difference, units in a parallel connection can obtain high energy conversion efficiency. Additionally, loaded with the matched impedance of 275.0 k\u03a9 at 10.0 kN and 10.0 Hz, the proposed device reached a maximum output power of 84.3 mW, which is enough to supply the low-power sensors. Moreover, the indoor load test illustrates that the electrical performance of the piezoelectric device was positively correlated with the simulated loads when loaded with matched resistance. Furthermore, the electrical property remained stable after the fatigue test of 100,000 cyclic loads.

In this paper, 3D-printed cuboid-shaped liquid cells featuring a rectangular vibrating plate in one of the sides, actuated by PZT piezoelectric layers, were designed, fabricated and tested. The device was resonantly excited in the 3rd-order roof tile-shaped vibration mode of the plate and validated as a density-viscosity sensor. Furthermore, conditioning circuits were designed to adapt the impedance of the resonator and to cancel parasitic effects. This allowed us to implement a phase-locked loop-based oscillator circuit whose oscillation frequency and voltage amplitude could be calibrated against density and viscosity of the liquid flowing through the cell. To demonstrate the performance, the sensor was calibrated with a set of artificial model solutions of grape must, representing stages of a wine fermentation process. Our results demonstrate the high potential of the low-cost sensor to detect the decrease in sugar and the increase in ethanol concentrations during a grape must fermentation, with a resolution of 10 \u00b5g/mL and 3 \u00b5Pa\u00b7s as upper limits for the density and viscosity, respectively.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["JavierToledo", "V\u00edctorRuiz-D\u00edez", "JaimeVelasco", "JorgeHernando-Garc\u00eda", "Jos\u00e9 LuisS\u00e1nchez-Rojas"], "doi": "10.3390/s21227654\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111916\n10.3390/polym10060629\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.01.013\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.025\n10.1038/srep35111\n10.1063/1.4916222\n10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2011.5969506\n10.1002/adma.201400334\n10.1089/3DP.2016.0021\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2356973\n10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2311810\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.05.004\n10.3390/s19071706\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03426\n10.1126/sciadv.aba5575\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.09.017\n10.1038/micronano.2015.13\n10.1080/05704928.2017.1287082\n10.3390/s151026018\n10.3390/s18093049\n10.1038/s41563-018-0268-1\n10.1002/pssa.201532272\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.06.048\n10.1023/A:1009926623551\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.07.096\n10.1007/s00542-012-1437-9\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1386\n10.1109/ICSENS.2007.355810\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.09.006\n10.3390/mi10020145\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.05.024\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.02.025\n10.1088/0960-1317/26/8/084012\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.10.002\n10.1063/1.4928429\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/7/074003\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/5/055027\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.2.375\n10.3390/ma11081333\n10.1038/s41598-019-56350-w\n10.3390/polym12071529\n10.1016/j.polymer.2019.02.042\n10.1109/19.963169\n10.1007/s00542-016-2833-3\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.091\n10.1017/CBO9780511812798\n10.1109/PROC.1986.13429\n10.1063/1.3387753\n10.1063/1.1873060\n10.1155/2008/697062\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.10.106\n10.1021/ac00170a032\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2000.922587\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.020\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.01.013\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.03.017\n10.1109/I2MTC.2012.6229687\n10.1007/s00542-017-3536-0\n10.1007/s00542-014-2095-x"}
{"title": "Wearable Bluetooth Triage Healthcare Monitoring System.", "abstract": "Triage is the first interaction between a patient and a nurse/paramedic. This assessment, usually performed at Emergency departments, is a highly dynamic process and there are international grading systems that according to the patient condition initiate the patient journey. Triage requires an initial rapid assessment followed by routine checks of the patients' vitals, including respiratory rate, temperature, and pulse rate. Ideally, these checks should be performed continuously and remotely to reduce the workload on triage nurses; optimizing tools and monitoring systems can be introduced and include a wearable patient monitoring system that is not at the expense of the patient's comfort and can be remotely monitored through wireless connectivity. In this study, we assessed the suitability of a small ceramic piezoelectric disk submerged in a skin-safe silicone dome that enhances contact with skin, to detect wirelessly both respiration and cardiac events at several positions on the human body. For the purposes of this evaluation, we fitted the sensor with a respiratory belt as well as a single lead ECG, all acquired simultaneously. To complete Triage parameter collection, we also included a medical-grade contact thermometer. Performances of cardiac and respiratory events detection were assessed. The instantaneous heart and respiratory rates provided by the proposed sensor, the ECG and the respiratory belt were compared via statistical analyses. In all considered sensor positions, very high performances were achieved for the detection of both cardiac and respiratory events, except for the wrist, which provided lower performances for respiratory rates. These promising yet preliminary results suggest the proposed wireless sensor could be used as a wearable, hands-free monitoring device for triage assessment within emergency departments.

{"title": "A Self-Powered and Battery-Free Vibrational Energy to Time Converter for Wireless Vibration Monitoring.", "abstract": "Wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) are the fundamental part of an Internet of Things (IoT) system for detecting and transmitting data to a master node for processing. Several research studies reveal that one of the disadvantages of conventional, battery-powered WSNs, however, is that they typically require periodic maintenance. This paper aims to contribute to existing research studies on this issue by exploring a new energy-autonomous and battery-free WSN concept for monitor vibrations. The node is self-powered from the conversion of ambient mechanical vibration energy into electrical energy through a piezoelectric transducer implemented with lead-free lithium niobate piezoelectric material to also explore solutions that go towards a greener and more sustainable IoT. Instead of implementing any particular sensors, the vibration measurement system exploits the proportionality between the mechanical power generated by a piezoelectric transducer and the time taken to store it as electrical energy in a capacitor. This helps reduce the component count with respect to conventional WSNs, as well as energy consumption and production costs, while optimizing the overall node size and weight.

The composites with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and carbon black (CB) are pre-dispersed in different solvents (acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and ethanol) before adding photopolymer and continuing dispersion. For all prepared suspensions, a reduction in viscosity is observed, which is favorable for 3D printing. In contrast, the addition of 0.1 wt.% nanomaterials, even with poor dispersion, leads to curing depth reduction up to 90% compared to pristine photopolymer, where the nanomaterial dispersion is identified as a contributing factor.

The piezoelectric actuator includes a flexible beam. By using response surface analysis (RSM), taking the large displacement as the objective function and on the premise of meeting the strength requirements, the structural parameters of the flexible beam were analyzed. In the process of fiber push-out, the interfacial shear stress was estimated by establishing the system integrating the fiber-matrix-composite three-phase model and the piezoelectric actuator model using the analytic method, and the theoretical analysis results of the fiber interface mechanical properties were given. A prototype of the system was made, and the performance tests of the piezoelectric actuator and the fiber push-out device were carried out. The test results showed that the designed piezoelectric actuator can achieve a stepping resolution of 6.67 \u03bcm and a maximum displacement of about 100 \u03bcm at the input voltage of 150 V, which is consistent with the design results. The extrusion test of a single fiber was carried out using a piezoelectric actuator. The mechanical properties of the interfacial layer during the push-out process were measured and the interfacial shear strength was calculated, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis results.

{"title": "Design of Planar Array Transducers Based on Connected 1-3 Piezoelectric Composites.", "abstract": "To improve the transmission performance and preparation of a transducer array, two planar array transducers based on connected 1-3 piezoelectric composites as a matrix were designed. Each transducer contained 25 array elements with a gap of 1 mm between them. The length, width and height of each array element were 1 mm, 26 mm and 5 mm, respectively. Two kinds of array transducers were tested through finite element simulation and experiments. The array transducer prototype was fabricated based on two kinds of composite materials, and the fabrication cycle was short. Our results show that the maximum transmission voltage response of the two-phase 1-3 full array driver is up to 179 dB at 200-400 kHz and the acoustic radiation intensity can be increased by up to 22% compared with the traditional splicing transducer array. It is suitable for short-range target positioning and measurement. Moreover, in the single element mode, the beam of the three-phase 1-3 transducer has no sidelobe and a single element -3 dB beam width of up to 91\u00b0. Furthermore, the beam width of the two-phase 1-3 type is 54\u00b0, and the acoustic radiation breadth is improved by 40.6%.

The planar motion of the platform is generated via excitation of the first bending mode of the corresponding plate using a single harmonic signal while the remaining plates operate as passive supports.

To improve the grinding efficiency in the component production process, the manual operation time during the grinding process needs to be reduced. The grinding process requires the installation of the dressed grinding wheel onto the grinding machine spindle, and the off-line dressing results in installation errors during the loading and unloading process, which requires more time for manual alignment. To achieve self-aligning, the circumferential contour of the grinding wheel was first restored by the reversal method, then noise reduction and circle fitting were performed to obtain the eccentricity value and eccentricity position between the flange and the spindle, and finally, the flange was adjusted finely by three piezoelectric actuators installed inside the flange to reduce the eccentricity. Three repetitive experiments were conducted to verify that the self-aligning flange can reduce the eccentricity value by retracting the piezoelectric actuators so that the proper alignment between the flange and the spindle could meet the requirements; the average eccentricity value of the three experiments decreased by 74%, which greatly improved the efficiency of the grinding wheel alignment.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["XuepengHuang", "ZhenzhongWang", "BingyiShen", "PengliLei"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12111393\n10.1177/0954409714527929\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2021.09.021\n10.3390/mi11110969\n10.1007/s00170-018-2598-1\n10.1007/s00170-018-1778-3\n10.1007/s00170-008-1688-x\n10.1088/1742-6596/13/1/029\n10.1007/s12541-018-0141-9\n10.1016/j.cirp.2007.05.086\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.07.017\n10.1016/j.asoc.2014.05.028"}
{"title": "Modeling and Compensation of Dynamic Hysteresis with Force-Voltage Coupling for Piezoelectric Actuators.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in the field of micro- and nanopositioning due to their high frequency response, high stiffness, and high resolution. However, piezoelectric actuators have hysteresis nonlinearity, which severely affects their positioning accuracy. As the driving frequency increases, the performance of piezoelectric actuators further degrades. In addition, the impact of force on piezoelectric actuators cannot be ignored in practical applications. Dynamic hysteresis with force-voltage coupling makes the hysteresis phenomenon more complicated when force and driving voltage are both applied to the piezoelectric actuator. Existing hysteresis models are complicated, or inaccurate in describing dynamic hysteresis with force-voltage coupling. To solve this problem, a force-voltage-coupled Prandtl-Ishlinskii (FVPI) model is proposed in this paper. First, the influence of driving frequency and dynamic force on the output displacement of the piezoelectric actuators are analyzed. Then, the accuracy of the FVPI model is verified through experiments. Finally, a force integrated direct inverse (F-DI) compensator based on the FVPI model is designed. The experimental results from this study show that the F-DI compensator can effectively suppress dynamic hysteresis with force-voltage coupling of piezoelectric actuators.

The fast tool servo (FTS) based on the piezoelectric actuator is widely used in the compensation machining of high-precision optical mirrors.

Subsequently, a composite control algorithm was proposed, targeting the problems of hysteresis and phase delay. The modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii inverse hysteresis model was used to overcome the hysteresis effect and a zero-phase error tracker was designed to reduce the phase error.

To experimentally verify the findings, we manufactured a parallel electric-acoustic transmission network for transducers excited by multifrequency driving signals. We found that the tangentially polarized thin cylindrical transducers achieved a much higher electric-acoustic conversion efficiency than the radially polarized thin cylindrical transducers. The electric-acoustic impulse response of the transducers consisted of a direct-current damping with lower-frequency components, a damping oscillation with higher-frequency elements, and a higher resonant frequency of the transducer over its center frequency. The characteristics of radiated acoustic signals included contributions from the geometrical shape and size of the transducer, the physical parameters of piezoelectric material, the type of driving-voltage signals, and the polarization mode of the transducers. In comparison, our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with experimental observations.

{"title": "Recent Advances on Conducting Polymers Based Nanogenerators for Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "With the rapid growth of numerous portable electronics, it is critical to develop high-performance, lightweight, and environmentally sustainable energy generation and power supply systems. The flexible nanogenerators, including piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), are currently viable candidates for combination with personal devices and wireless sensors to achieve sustained energy for long-term working circumstances due to their great mechanical qualities, superior environmental adaptability, and outstanding energy-harvesting performance. Conductive materials for electrode as the critical component in nanogenerators, have been intensively investigated to optimize their performance and avoid high-cost and time-consuming manufacture processing.

{"title": "Theoretical Study on Widening Bandwidth of Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester with Nonlinear Characteristics.", "abstract": "In order to make a piezoelectric vibration energy harvester collect more energy on a broader frequency range, nonlinearity is introduced into the system, allowing the harvester to produce multiple steady states and deflecting the frequency response curve. However, the harvester can easily maintain intra-well motion rather than inter-well motion, which seriously affects its efficiency. The aim of this paper is to analyze how to take full advantage of the nonlinear characteristics to widen the bandwidth of the piezoelectric vibration energy harvester and obtain more energy. The influence of the inter-permanent magnet torque on the bending of the piezoelectric cantilever beam is considered in the theoretical modeling. The approximate analytical solutions of the primary and 1/3 subharmonic resonance of the harvester are obtained by using the complex dynamic frequency (CDF) method so as to compare the energy acquisition effect of the primary resonance and subharmonic resonance, determine the generation conditions of subharmonic resonance, and analyze the effect of primary resonance and subharmonic resonance on broadening the bandwidth of the harvester under different external excitations. The results show that the torque significantly affects the equilibrium point and piezoelectric output of the harvester. The effective frequency band of the bistable nonlinear energy harvester is 270% wider than that of the linear harvester, and the 1/3 subharmonic resonance broadens the band another 92% so that the energy harvester can obtain more than 0.1 mW in the frequency range of 18 Hz. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the influence of torque when modeling. The introduction of nonlinearity can broaden the frequency band of the harvester when it is in primary resonance, and the subharmonic resonance can make the harvester obtain more energy in the global frequency range.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["ZhangQichang", "YangYang", "WangWei"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12111301\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009\n10.3390/mi12080973\n10.1016/j.jsv.2014.11.035\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2031695\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/11/115021\n10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103173\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.12.025\n10.1063/1.3159815\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.077\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac01a7\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.02.003\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.05.029\n10.1140/epjb/e2016-60699-0\n10.1063/1.5001267\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.011\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab45c6\n10.3233/JAE-209477\n10.1016/j.jsv.2021.116074\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.10.001\n10.1016/j.jsv.2014.05.054\n10.1007/s42114-018-0046-1\n10.1021/acsami.8b13261\n10.1002/mame.201800463\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.06.003\n10.1063/1.5139480\n10.1140/epjst/e2015-02592-6\n10.1155/1999/97902\n10.1007/s11071-019-05005-6\n10.1155/2019/1050143"}
{"title": "Hysteresis Compensation for a Piezoelectric Actuator of Active Helicopter Rotor Using Compound Control.", "abstract": "Active rotor with trailing-edge flaps is a promising method to alleviate vibrations and noise level of helicopters. Hysteresis of the piezoelectric actuators used to drive the flaps can degrade the performance of an active rotor. In this study, bench-top tests are conducted to measure the nonlinear hysteresis of a double-acting piezoelectric actuator. Based on the experimental data, a rate-dependent hysteresis model is established by combining a Bouc-Wen model and a transfer function of a second order system. Good agreement is exhibited between the model outputs and the measured results for different frequencies. A compound control regime composed of a feedforward compensator and PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) feedback control is developed to suppress the hysteresis of this actuator. Bench-top test results demonstrate that this compound control regime is capable to suppress hysteresis at different frequencies from 10 Hz to 60 Hz, and errors between the desired actuator outputs and the measured outputs are reduced dramatically at different frequencies, revealing that this compound control regime has the potential to be implemented in an active helicopter rotor to suppress actuator hysteresis.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["JinlongZhou", "LinghuaDong", "WeidongYang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12111298\n10.1006/jsvi.2002.5179\n10.1002/stc.4300030103\n10.4050/JAHS.59.041001\n10.1177/1045389X14533439\n10.5139/IJASS.2015.16.4.520\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2003)16:4(167)\n10.2514/6.1997-1283\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/020\n10.2514/1.17655\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.09.020\n10.1177/0954410013478254\n10.2514/1.53911\n10.2514/6.2010-2994\n10.1007/978-81-322-1913-2\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.04.012\n10.1155/2016/3424191\n10.1109/TASE.2010.2081979\n10.3390/act7030037\n10.3390/mi10030183\n10.3390/mi10120861\n10.3390/act10100247"}

{"title": "Application of Smart Materials in the Actuation System of a Gas Injector.", "abstract": "This paper presents the results of research related to the selection of materials for passive and active components of a three-layer piezoelectric cantilever converter. The transducer is intended for use in a low-pressure gas-phase injector executive system. To ensure the functionality of the injector, its flow characteristics and the effective range of valve opening had to be determined. Therefore, a spatial model of the complete injector was developed, and the necessary flow analyses were performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in Ansys Fluent environment. The opening and closing of the injector valve are controlled by a piezoelectric transducer. Thus, its static electromechanical characteristics were found in analytical form. On this basis, the energy demand of the converter, required to obtain the desired valve opening, was determined. Assuming a constant transducer geometry, 40 variants of material combinations were considered. In the performed analyses, it was assumed that the passive elements of the actuator are made of typical materials used in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMSs) (copper, nickel, silicon alloys and aluminum alloys). As for the active components of the converter, it was assumed that they could be made of polymeric or ceramic piezoelectric materials. On the basis of the performed tests, it was found that the energy demand is most influenced by the relative stiffness of the transducer materials (Young's modulus ratio) and the piezoelectric constant of the active component (", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-11-28", "authors": ["GrzegorzMieczkowski", "DariuszSzpica", "AndrzejBorawski", "SauliusDiliunas", "TilmutePilkaite", "VitalisLeisis"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14226984\n10.3390/ma13235448\n10.3390/ma12142216\n10.3390/s19214668\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.02.029\n10.3390/s21010087\n10.1007/s00542-020-05190-0\n10.3390/polym12112754\n10.3390/s21103509\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.06.532\n10.1186/s12302-020-00407-5\n10.2516/ogst:2003008\n10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.052\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.109\n10.1007/s40825-019-0112-3\n10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.120\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.08.041\n10.4271/2007-01-2051\n10.17531/ein.2015.1.1\n10.1186/s10033-019-0352-8\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.12.110\n10.1016/S0301-4215(02)00223-9\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.12.034\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2016.03.008\n10.1016/j.energy.2013.10.071\n10.3390/en12214023\n10.1016/j.fuel.2018.03.009\n10.1115/1.4006627\n10.17482/uumfd.532535\n10.1016/j.conengprac.2014.04.004\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.01.080\n10.1007/s11630-020-1339-6\n10.1088/1742-6596/769/1/012082\n10.5755/j01.mech.22.4.12764\n10.15632/jtam-pl.55.1.69\n10.1016/S0016-0032(25)90162-7\n10.1016/S1359-6454(99)00294-3\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.01.045\n10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2018.05.010"}

The c-cut sapphire was processed into a lens shape to deposit a ZnO film using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, and an upper and a lower electrode were deposited using E-beam evaporation. The electrode was a Au thin film, and a Ti thin film was used as an adhesion layer. The surface microstructure of the ZnO film was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the thickness of the film was measured using a focused ion beam (FIB) for piezoelectric ceramics deposited on the sapphire wafer, and the thickness of ZnO was measured to be 4.87 \u03bcm. As a result of analyzing the crystal growth plane using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, it was confirmed that the piezoelectric characteristics were grown to the (0002) plane. The sensor fabricated in this study had a center frequency of 352 MHz. The bandwidth indicates the range of upper (375 MHz) and lower (328 MHz) frequencies at the -6 dB level of the center frequency.

Firstly, detailed analysis and comparison discussion about the gain-phase difference of array signal when the environmental parameters change, and the gain-phase changes respect to the environmental parameters could be obtained. Secondly, array error matrix is structured and substituted into the steering vector of the original 2D-MUSIC algorithm to compensate. Finally, the compensated 2D-MUSIC algorithm is applied for estimating the initial estimates of damage.

Herein, we describe heat transfer membranes composed of graphene which have been modified by intrinsic thermally conductive polymers with different molecular weights. The presence of macromolecular surface modifiers not only constructed the graphene heat transfer interface by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, but also significantly enhanced the membranes' in-plane thermal conductivity by utilizing their intrinsic heat transfer properties.

{"title": "A Single Step Preparation of Photothermally Active Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membranes Using Triethyl Phosphate as a Green Solvent for Distillation Applications.", "abstract": "Membrane distillation is a growing technology that can address the growing problem of water shortage. The implementation of renewable energy and a reduction in the environmental impact of membrane production could improve the sustainability of this process. With this perspective, porous hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes were prepared using triethyl phosphate (TEP) as a green solvent, using the non-solvent induced phase separation technique.

{"title": "Fabrication of High Performance PVDF Hollow Fiber Membrane Using Less Toxic Solvent at Different Additive Loading and Air Gap.", "abstract": "Existing toxic solvents in the manufacturing of polymeric membranes have been raising concerns due to the risks of exposure to health and the environment. Furthermore, the lower tensile strength of the membrane renders these membranes unable to endure greater pressure during water treatment. To sustain a healthier ecosystem, fabrication of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane using a less toxic solvent, triethyl phosphate (TEP), with a lower molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) (0-3 wt.%) additive were experimentally demonstrated via a phase inversion-based spinning technique at various air gap (10, 20 and 30 cm). Membrane with 2 wt.% of PEG 400 exhibited the desired ultrafiltration asymmetric morphology, while 3 wt.% PEG 400 resulting microfiltration. The surface roughness, porosity, and water flux performance increased as the loading of PEG 400 increased. The mechanical properties and contact angle of the fabricated membrane were influenced by the air gap where 20 cm indicate 2.91 MPa and 84.72\u00b0, respectively, leading to a stronger tensile and hydrophilicity surface. Lower toxicity TEP as a solvent helped in increasing the tensile properties of the membrane as well as producing an eco-friendly membrane towards creating a sustainable environment.

The potential interaction between an amphiphile-based HLLC layer and the substrate surface, however, has not been fully explored. In this research, hydrophilic and hydrophobic microporous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrates were chosen, respectively, to prepare TFC membranes with the active layers templated from HLLC, consisting of dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide, water, and a mixture of poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The pore size of the active layer was found to decrease by about 1.6 \u00c5 compared to that of the free-standing HLLC after polymerization, but no significant difference was observable by using either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates (26.9 \u00c5 vs. 27.1 \u00c5). The water flux of the TFC membrane with the hydrophobic substrate, however, was higher than that with the hydrophilic one.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Signals in Vascularized Bone Regeneration.", "abstract": "The demand for bone substitutes is increasing in Western countries. Bone graft substitutes aim to provide reconstructive surgeons with off-the-shelf alternatives to the natural bone taken from humans or animal species. Under the tissue engineering paradigm, biomaterial scaffolds can be designed by incorporating bone stem cells to decrease the disadvantages of traditional tissue grafts. However, the effective clinical application of tissue-engineered bone is limited by insufficient neovascularization. As bone is a highly vascularized tissue, new strategies to promote both osteogenesis and vasculogenesis within the scaffolds need to be considered for a successful regeneration. It has been demonstrated that bone and blood vases are piezoelectric, namely, electric signals are locally produced upon mechanical stimulation of these tissues. The specific effects of electric charge generation on different cells are not fully understood, but a substantial amount of evidence has suggested their functional and physiological roles. This review summarizes the special contribution of piezoelectricity as a stimulatory signal for bone and vascular tissue regeneration, including osteogenesis, angiogenesis, vascular repair, and tissue engineering, by considering different stem cell sources entailed with osteogenic and angiogenic potential, aimed at collecting the key findings that may enable the development of successful

Current efforts focus on developing new technologies to prepare microfibers with controllable morphological and structural features to enhance their functions. Here, a piezoelectric microfluidic platform is presented for consecutive spinning of functional microfibers with programmable spindle-knots. In this platform, a jet of a pregel-solution flowing in the channel can be subjected to a programmable piezoelectric signal and vibrates synchronously. Following a rapid polymerization of the wavy jet, microfibers with corresponding morphologies can be generated, including uniform, gradient, and symmetrical knots. Such a unique knot structure contributes to a water-collection mechanism. Thus, it has been observed that microfibers with programmed knots enable even more flexible droplet handling and active water transport. In addition, by constructing higher-order knot fiber networks, practical applications including spray reaction, lab-on-a-chip vapor detection, etc., can also be demonstrated. it is believed that this platform opens a new avenue for fiber spinning, and the programmable microfibers would be highly applicable in chemical, biomedical, and environmental areas.", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2021-11-27", "authors": ["ChaoyuYang", "YunruYu", "XiaochengWang", "LuoranShang", "YuanjinZhao"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.202104309"}

The piezo-phototronic effect exhibits great potential in improving the quantum yield efficiencies of optoelectronic materials and devices and thus could help increase the energy conversion efficiency, thus alleviating the energy shortage crisis. In this review, the fundamental principles and challenges of representative optoelectronic materials and devices are presented, including photocatalysts (converting solar energy into chemical energy), solar cells (generating electricity directly under light illumination), photodetectors (converting light into electrical signals) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs, converting electric current into emitted light signals). Importantly, the mechanisms of how the piezo-phototronic effect controls the optoelectronic processes and the recent progress and applications in the above-mentioned materials and devices are highlighted and summarized. Only photocatalysts, solar cells, photodetectors, and LEDs that display piezo-phototronic behavior are reviewed.

{"title": "Fatigue and its effect on the piezopotential properties of gallium nitride nanowires.", "abstract": "The gallium nitride (GaN) nanowires (NWs) in piezotronic applications are usually under cyclic loading, which thus may inevitably suffer the mechanical fatigue. In this paper, the fatigue behaviours of defective GaN NWs are investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results show no significant changes in the molecular structures of GaN NWs until their final failure during the fatigue process. The final fracture occurring in the GaN NWs under fatigue loading is triggered by the crack that unusually initiates from the NW surface. The GaN NW with a smaller defect concentration or under the fatigue load with a smaller amplitude is found to possess a longer fatigue life. In addition, the ultimate fatigue strain of GaN NWs can be significantly increased by reducing the defect concentration of NWs. The material parameters including elastic constants, piezoelectric coefficients, and dielectric constants of GaN NWs in the fatigue test are evaluated through MD simulations, all of which are found to keep almost unchanged during the fatigue process. These material parameters together with the band gaps of GaN NWs extracted from first-principles calculations are employed in finite element calculations to investigate the piezopotential properties of GaN NWs under fatigue loading. No significant changes are found in the piezopotential properties of GaN NWs during the fatigue process, which indicates the long-term dynamic reliability of GaN NWs in piezotronic applications.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2021-11-24", "authors": ["JinZhang", "YaoDu"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ac3c7b"}

We recorded the initial dry weight for each PP and PVDFM using a digital balance to \u00b10.0001 precision for absorbency. PPs and PVDFMs were then immersed in deionized water and weighed to obtain the wet weight. The absorbency was calculated with the following formula: percent increase\u00a0=\u00a0([wet weight - dry weight]/dry weight) \u00d7 100. For endotoxin removal, we first quantified endotoxin remaining in wells after immersing PPs and PVDFMs in a 24-well plate containing 10 endotoxin units/mL Escherichia coli O55:B5 (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). We then extracted and quantified endotoxin from PPs and PVDFMs. Endotoxin was quantified using the Kinetic-QCL test (Lonza).\nThe absorbencies for the positively charged and noncharged PVDFMs were higher than the PPs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), with no difference between them (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05). The positively charged PVDFMs removed more endotoxin than the noncharged PVDFMs and the PPs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Moreover, the noncharged PVDFMs bound and removed more endotoxin than any PPs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nPVDFM prototype points are more absorbent than PPs. Moreover, the positively charged PVDFM points are more effective in binding and removing endotoxin than noncharged PVDFMs and PPs. This study suggests that positively charged PVDFMs with a 0.22-\u03bcm pore size could potentially replace PPs used in endodontics.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2021-11-24", "authors": ["Wing-YeeYeung", "Patricia ATordik", "Frederico CMartinho", "Robert KErnst"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2021.11.006"}

{"title": "The influence law of concrete aggregate particle size on acoustic emission wave attenuation.", "abstract": "Elastic waves have different attenuation laws when propagating in various materials, which is one of the important challenges in the application of non-destructive testing methods, such as acoustic emission (AE) technology in geotechnical engineering. The study presented in this paper investigated the influence mechanism of concrete composition materials and parameters on the propagation law of elastic waves using concrete specimens produced in six different particle sizes of sand or gravel. The burst AE signal was generated through the lead-breaking experiment, and ceramic piezoelectric sensors were used to record the signal waveform at different propagation distances. Through parameter analysis, spectrum analysis, and pattern recognition techniques, the influence of the concrete aggregate particle size on AE wave propagation and attenuation was revealed. The results show that the attenuation of elastic wave amplitude, energy spectral density, and frequency all were positively correlated with the aggregate particle size, and the elastic wave spectrum center of gravity generally decreased with the propagation distance. The ring count gradually decreased with the propagation distance, and the specimens with a larger aggregate particle size underwent a relatively faster ring count attenuation rate. The rise time increased rapidly with the propagation of the elastic wave, and the specimens with a larger aggregate particle size experienced a relatively rapid increase in rise time. In addition, in the feature spaces of ring count-amplitude and rise time-amplitude, the size of aggregate has an obvious influence on the distribution of these feature vector.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-11-24", "authors": ["XinWu", "QiaoYan", "AhmadrezaHedayat", "XuemeiWang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-02234-x\n10.6038/cjg20140315\n10.1093/gji/ggu076\n10.13722/j.cnki.jrme.2015.0868\n10.16450/j.cnki.issn.1004-6801.2018.02.011\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.477-478.620\n10.16265/j.cnki.issn1003-3033.2017.11.019\n10.1007/s12205-017-0844-y\n10.1016/S0266-3538(02)00065-9\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.12.041\n10.1023/B:RUNT.0000011623.75582.cc\n10.1007/BF02911033\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.94-96.178\n10.1016/j.tust.2018.09.023\n10.1016/j.petrol.2018.05.024\n10.1121/1.1894792\n10.6038/pg2014064\n10.6036/8987\n10.1098/rsos.170896\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.03.034"}

{"title": "Acidic pH reduces agonist efficacy and responses to synaptic-like glycine applications in zebrafish \u03b11 and rat \u03b11\u03b2 recombinant glycine receptors.", "abstract": "Many pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are modulated by extracellular pH. Glycine receptors (GlyRs) share this property, but it is not well understood how they are affected by pH changes. Whole cell experiments on HEK293 cells expressing zebrafish homomeric \u03b11 GlyR confirmed previous reports that acidic pH (6.4) reduces GlyR sensitivity to glycine, whereas alkaline pH (8.4) has small or negligible effects. In addition to that, at pH 6.4 we observed a reduction in the maximum responses to the partial agonists \u03b2-alanine and taurine relative to the full agonist glycine. In cell-attached single-channel recording, low pH reduced agonist efficacy, as the maximum open probability decreased from 0.97, 0.91 and 0.66 to 0.93, 0.57 and 0.34 for glycine, \u03b2-alanine and taurine, respectively, reflecting a threefold decrease in efficacy equilibrium constants for all three agonists. We also tested the effect of pH 6.4 in conditions that replicate those at the native synapse, recording outside-out currents elicited by fast application of millisecond pulses of agonists on \u03b11 and \u03b11\u03b2 GlyR, at a range of intracellular chloride concentrations. Acidic pH reduced the area under the curve of the currents, by reducing peak amplitude, slowing activation and speeding deactivation. Our results show that acidification of the extracellular pH by one unit, as may occur in pathological conditions such as ischaemia, impairs GlyR gating and is likely to reduce the effectiveness of glycinergic synaptic inhibition. KEY POINTS: Extracellular pH in the central nervous system (CNS) is known to shift towards acidic values during pathophysiological conditions such as ischaemia and seizures. Acidic extracellular pH is known to affect GABAergic inhibitory synapses, but its effect on signals mediated by glycine receptors (GlyR) is not well characterised. Moderate acidic conditions (pH 6.4) reduce the maximum single channel open probability of recombinant homomeric GlyRs produced by the neurotransmitter glycine or other agonists, such as \u03b2-alanine and taurine. When glycine was applied with a piezoelectric stepper to outside out patches, to simulate its fast rise and short duration at the synapse, responses became shorter and smaller at pH 6.4. The effect was also observed with physiologically low intracellular chloride and in mammalian heteromeric GlyRs. This suggests that acidic pH is likely to reduce the strength of inhibitory signalling at glycinergic synapses.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2021-11-22", "authors": ["JosipIvica", "RemigijusLape", "Lucia GSivilotti"], "doi": "10.1113/JP282171"}
{"title": "Crosstalk reduction in a piezoelectric phononic plate induced by electrical boundary conditions: Application to multi-element transducers.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a method of passive electrical decoupling which aimed at found application in reducing the crosstalk phenomenon in multi-element ultrasonic transducers. A homogeneous piezoelectric plate, covered on one side by a 1D periodic arrangement of thin metallic electrodes and on the other side by a full electrode, is considered. Finite element analysis and experimental measurements are performed to obtain the dispersion curves and normal displacements at the surface of the structure. It is shown that applying inductive shunts at the electrodes, band gaps can be created in the first Brillouin zone, which can prevent from the establishment of the first thickness mode in the plate. In that way the mechanical inter-element coupling can be lowered. Thus, the acoustic radiation in water from one sector excited at the resonance frequency is found to be closer to that of a piston mode. The transposition of this principle to the situation of a transducer including a rear medium and a front matching layer confirms the possibility of reducing the inter-element coupling. However, the physical effects at the origin of this reduction are different from those inherent to the cutting of a piezocomposite ceramic as it is done in most probes available in the market. As a result, we show that taking advantage of the electrical boundary conditions upon the passive elements in a transducer gives real opportunities for crosstalk reduction that may be implemented in ultrasonic systems for imaging in the medical field and in NDT.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-11-21", "authors": ["LFei", "LHaumesser", "L-PTran-Huu-Hu\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106638"}

In the last two decades, in particular, the research on piezoelectrics has largely been driven by the constantly changing technological demand, and the drive toward a sustainable society. Hence, environmental-friendly \"lead-free piezoelectrics\" have emerged in the anticipation of replacing lead-based counterparts with at least comparable performance. However, there are still obstacles to be overcome for realizing this objective, while the efforts in this direction already seem to culminate. Therefore, novel structural strategies need to be designed to address these issues and for further breakthrough in this field. Here, various strategies to enhance piezoelectric properties in lead-free systems with fundamental and historical context, and from atomic to macroscopic scale, are explored. The main challenges currently faced in the transition from lead-based to lead-free piezoelectrics are identified and key milestones for future research in this field are suggested.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Erbium: yttrium aluminum garnet (Er: YAG) laser is effective in reducing pain, swelling and trismus compared to rotary instruments in removing impacted lower third molars (3Ms).\nFor this systematic review, the searches were carried out independently by 2 researchers and the articles were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously established. The predictor variable was the study group (Er: YAG laser versus rotary instruments). The main outcome was the analysis of post-operative pain, edema, and trismus after third molar extractions.

A total of 299 lower 3Ms were removed, 126 with the Er: YAG laser, 142 with a drill and 31 with a piezoelectric instrument. The results of this meta-analysis showed that in the laser group there was a significant reduction in edema (1.82 [CI95%\u00a0=\u00a0-3.06 to -0.57] cm (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004)) and complications (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0004), a slight reduction in pain after 2 days (P\u00a0=\u00a0.030) and there was no variation in trismus (P\u00a0=\u00a0.200) when compared to the drill group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible use of the vibration sensor to detect if the needle tip was at the knee intra-articular position by characterizing the frequency component of the vibration signal during empty syringe air injection.\nTwo milliliters of air were injected supero-laterally at extra- and intra-articular positions of a cadaveric knee joint, using needles of size 18, 21 and 24 gauge (G). Ultrasonography was used to confirm the positions of needle tip. A piezoelectric accelerometer was mounted medially on the knee joint to collect the vibration signals which were analyzed to characterize the frequency components of the signals during injections.\nThe vibration frequency band power in the range of 500-1500\u2009Hz was visually observed to potentially localize the needle tip placement during air injection whether they were at the knee extra-articular or intra-articular positions, as demonstrated by the higher band power (over -\u200940\u2009dB or dB) for all the needle sizes. The differences of frequency band power between extra- and intra-articular positions were 18.1\u2009dB, 26.4\u2009dB and 39.2\u2009dB for the needle size 18G, 21G and 24G respectively.

{"title": "Numerical and experimental studies on needle impact characteristics in ultrasonic shot peening.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic shot peening(USP) is an advanced surface treatment technology for obtaining excellent surface properties or manufacturing a three-dimensional curved surface of the metal sheets. The impact of the medium driven by ultrasonic vibration is significant to parameter optimization and excellent performance of the USP technology. However, the impact characteristics of the medium lack careful study, which is a complex dynamic analysis involving many factors, such as collision, plastic deformation, air pressure, etc. In this paper, a detection system is successfully developed to investigate the needle impact force and frequency against the material surface, consisting of a piezoelectric load sensor, oscilloscope, and a single needle USP device. Moreover, the FE model of the needle impact is developed simultaneously to study the characteristics of residual stress implantation induced by needle impact. Based on the experiment and FE simulation results, it is discovered that the impacts with high speed primarily determine the thickness of the modified layer implanted with residual stress during multiple impacts at different rates. According to residual stress implantation characteristics, the low-speed impact whose speed does not reach 50% of the maximum impact speed was defined as the ineffective impact. Besides, increasing the amplitude of ultrasonic vibration results in a significant increase in the maximum impact force and the effective impact frequency. The travel distance of needle impact has a considerable effect on the effective impact frequency, but it has little effect on the maximum impact force. Finally, it was concluded that the low air pressure plays a positive role in the needle impact. Furthermore, excessive air pressure hinders the needle impact and results in a decline in the effective impact frequency and the maximum impact force.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-11-16", "authors": ["QinglongZhang", "SuZhao", "AzizUl Hassan Mohsan", "LeiYu", "MenggangZhai", "XiaowenQi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106634"}
{"title": "Healthy Women and Men Do Not Show Differences in Tongue Strength and Regular Effort Saliva Swallows as Assessed by Piezo-Resistive Sensors: Results from a Reproducibility Study.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to establish the reproducibility of tongue strength measurements in healthy women and men during maximum anterior isometric pressure (MAIP) and regular effort saliva swallows (RESS). In this cross-sectional study, 30 healthy young adults were required to push with the tip of the tongue on a piezo-resistive sensor glued to the hard palate, immediately above the central incisor line. Tongue pressures exerted on the sensor during MAIP and spontaneous RESS were recorded. Participants underwent a retest procedure within the same session to verify the reproducibility of measurements, as determined by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimum detectable change (MDC). Complete data were obtained from 30 subjects (15 women, 15 men; mean age 31.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\u00a0years; mean weight 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4\u00a0kg). Compared to women, men showed a trend for generating larger MAIP (p\u2009=\u20090.06; d\u2009=\u20090.71) and RESS (p\u2009=\u20090.07; d\u2009=\u20090.69). After normalizing to body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), such trends disappeared. At retest, MAIP and RESS proved stable and highly reliable (all ICCs\u2009\u2265\u20090.93) in men and women but associated to moderate variability as for SEM and MDC, with MAIP estimates associated to smaller SEM and MDC (SEM ranging 7.4-14.2%; MDC 18.6-20.9%) than RESS (SEM ranging 20.4-38.5%; MDC 52.5-55.6%). Piezo-resistive pressure sensors allow clinicians and researchers to perform reproducible measurements of tongue muscle performance. However, if therapeutic interventions are administered, measurement variability in tongue performance should be considered when appraising their clinical efficacy, especially for those populations who display impaired performance and may not be capable to generate high and stable forces.

{"title": "Penta-peptide ATN-161 based neutralization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has become a big challenge for the scientific community worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host cell by the spike protein binding with an ACE2 receptor present on the host cell. Developing safe and effective inhibitor appears an urgent need to interrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 receptor in order to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have examined the penta-peptide ATN-161 as potential inhibitor of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, where ATN-161 has been commercially approved for the safety and possess high affinity and specificity towards the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 subunit in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We carried out experiments and confirmed these phenomena that the virus bindings were indeed minimized. ATN-161 peptide can be used as an inhibitor of protein-protein interaction (PPI) stands as a crucial interaction in biological systems. The molecular docking finding suggests that the binding energy of the ACE2-spike protein complex is reduced in the presence of ATN-161. Protein-protein docking binding energy (-40.50\u00a0kcal/mol) of the spike glycoprotein toward the human ACE2 and binding of ATN-161 at their binding interface reduced the biding energy (-26.25\u00a0kcal/mol). The finding of this study suggests that ATN-161 peptide can mask the RBD of the spike protein and be considered as a neutralizing candidate by binding with the ACE2 receptor. Peptide-based masking of spike S1 protein (RBD) and its neutralization is a highly promising strategy to prevent virus penetration into the host cell. Thus masking of the RBD leads to the loss of receptor recognition property which can reduce the chance of infection host cells.", "journal": "Biochemistry and biophysics reports", "date": "2021-11-16", "authors": ["GulamRabbani", "Saeyoung NateAhn", "HyunhwaKwon", "KhurshidAhmad", "InhoChoi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrep.2021.101170"}
{"title": "Stack-Layer Dual-Element Ultrasonic Transducer for Broadband Functional Photoacoustic Tomography.", "abstract": "Current Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) approaches are based on a single-element transducer that exhibits compromised performance in clinical imaging applications. For example, vascular, tumors are likely to have complicated shapes and optical absorptions, covering relatively wide spectra in acoustic signals. The wide ultrasonic spectra make it difficult to set the detection bandwidth optimally in advance. In this work, we propose a stack-layer dual-element ultrasonic transducer for PAT. The central frequencies of the two piezoelectric elements are 3.06\u00a0MHz (99.3% bandwidth at -6\u00a0dB) and 11.07\u00a0MHz (85.2% bandwidth at -6\u00a0dB), respectively. This transducer bridges the sensitivity capability of ultrasound and the high contrast of optical methods in functional photoacoustic tomography. The dual-element transducer enabled multiscale analysis of the vascular network in rat brains. Using a multi-wavelength imaging scheme, the blood oxygen saturation was also detected. The preliminary results showed the great potential of broad-bandwidth functional PAT on vascular network visualization. The method can also be extended to whole-body imaging of small animals, breast cancer detection, and finger joint imaging.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2021-11-16", "authors": ["XiaofeiLuo", "YiqiCai", "ZeyuChen", "HanShan", "XinSun", "QiboLin", "JianguoMa", "BoWang"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2021.786376\n10.1038/s41551-017-0068\n10.1109/tuffc.2020.2977210\n10.1002/tbio.202000004\n10.1038/s41551-020-0527-8\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.07.004\n10.1118/1.1333409\n10.1118/1.598984\n10.1088/0031-9155/49/7/018\n10.1117/1.JBO.20.6.066010\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.05.001\n10.1038/s41467-018-04576-z\n10.1016/j.pacs.2019.100156\n10.1364/AO.58.009305\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2011.01.006\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.04.002\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.10.005\n10.1038/s41551-021-00735-8\n10.1016/j.pacs.2020.100213\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.08.003\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1039/c8ee03006e\n10.1002/mp.14880\n10.1364/AO.412609\n10.1126/science.1216210\n10.1118/1.3013698\n10.1038/nbt839\n10.1117/1.2192804\n10.1038/s41377-018-0036-7\n10.1364/AO.55.002301\n10.1103/PhysRevE.67.056605\n10.1103/PhysRevE.71.016706\n10.1117/1.3227035\n10.1002/jbio.201700024\n10.1364/Boe.387985\n10.1016/j.pacs.2019.100148"}

{"title": "Preparation of Smart Materials by Additive Manufacturing Technologies: A Review.", "abstract": "Over the last few decades, advanced manufacturing and additive printing technologies have made incredible inroads into the fields of engineering, transportation, and healthcare. Among additive manufacturing technologies, 3D printing is gradually emerging as a powerful technique owing to a combination of attractive features, such as fast prototyping, fabrication of complex designs/structures, minimization of waste generation, and easy mass customization. Of late, 4D printing has also been initiated, which is the sophisticated version of the 3D printing. It has an extra advantageous feature: retaining shape memory and being able to provide instructions to the printed parts on how to move or adapt under some environmental conditions, such as, water, wind, light, temperature, or other environmental stimuli. This advanced printing utilizes the response of smart manufactured materials, which offer the capability of changing shapes postproduction over application of any forms of energy. The potential application of 4D printing in the biomedical field is huge. Here, the technology could be applied to tissue engineering, medicine, and configuration of smart biomedical devices. Various characteristics of next generation additive printings, namely 3D and 4D printings, and their use in enhancing the manufacturing domain, their development, and some of the applications have been discussed. Special materials with piezoelectric properties and shape-changing characteristics have also been discussed in comparison with conventional material options for additive printing.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-11-14", "authors": ["KunalMondal", "Prabhat KumarTripathy"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14216442\n10.5402/2012/208760\n10.3390/mi11090796\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.11.013\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.03.035\n10.1016/j.cad.2015.04.001\n10.1021/acs.iecr.1c00788\n10.1007/s11837-020-04426-8\n10.1016/j.mset.2021.06.006\n10.1016/j.mtchem.2020.100328\n10.1007/s00366-015-0407-0\n10.1002/ad.1710\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1198630\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.02.012\n10.1007/s10118-018-2089-8\n10.1002/adfm.201805290\n10.3390/su122410628\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.02.068\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1097054\n10.3390/app10093020\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.08.049\n10.3390/ma12081353\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.003\n10.1155/2019/9656938\n10.1186/s13036-015-0001-4\n10.1080/07853890701881788\n10.1089/3dp.2018.0157\n10.1007/s42114-019-00087-7\n10.30919/esmm5f103\n10.30919/es8d503\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00074\n10.1002/adfm.202000187\n10.1088/1757-899X/653/1/012024\n10.3390/ma12152355\n10.1007/s00107-017-1274-8\n10.1126/science.aau7114\n10.1126/science.aau5119\n10.1016/j.dib.2020.106119\n10.1126/science.aax8760\n10.1016/j.nanoms.2019.03.003\n10.47545/etrj.2019.4.1.049\n10.3390/polym13091499\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00170\n10.1007/s42114-018-0067-9\n10.30919/esmm5f706\n10.1007/s42114-020-00183-z\n10.1021/acsnano.8b00909\n10.1038/srep29977\n10.1063/1.4819837\n10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2021.110757\n10.1108/AA-07-2014-062\n10.3390/app10207254\n10.1007/s00170-021-07233-w\n10.1088/1757-899X/376/1/012123\n10.1038/s43246-021-00165-8\n10.1080/19475411.2019.1591541\n10.3389/fmats.2021.661999\n10.1016/j.eng.2020.01.015\n10.1007/s12206-015-0925-0\n10.3390/mi10070433\n10.1038/srep07422\n10.1038/nmat4544\n10.1002/adhm.201200458\n10.1016/j.eml.2015.07.005\n10.1038/srep24224\n10.1038/srep22431\n10.1039/C5MH00212E\n10.1002/marc.201500079\n10.3390/polym13183101\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2009.10.008\n10.1016/j.matdes.2011.04.065\n10.1038/srep31110\n10.1007/s40204-018-0097-y\n10.1155/2018/3891686\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/094007\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/2/02LT01\n10.1002/adma.201503132\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa738e\n10.1021/acsami.7b04095\n10.1021/nn503268f\n10.1038/s41586-018-0185-0\n10.1002/admt.201900293\n10.3390/polym9040138\n10.1002/adma.201501099\n10.1038/s41598-018-20385-2\n10.1002/smll.201401343\n10.1002/anie.201105925\n10.1016/j.carbon.2014.02.068\n10.1021/nl3038773\n10.1039/C6TC01371F\n10.1002/adma.201400334\n10.1371/journal.pone.0049365\n10.1038/nmat1974\n10.1016/j.synthmet.2016.03.014\n10.1002/adma.201301036\n10.1002/adma.201505391\n10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00164-0\n10.1038/s41598-018-29266-0\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.076\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/9/094013\n10.1088/2058-8585/aa56e8\n10.1039/C4TA03256J\n10.1038/srep11181\n10.3390/mi10120814\n10.1016/j.msec.2013.03.048\n10.1016/j.aiepr.2021.05.001\n10.1016/j.cobme.2017.04.002\n10.1080/19475411.2019.1631899\n10.1021/acsami.6b07388\n10.1021/acsami.6b12824\n10.3390/ma11050840\n10.1016/j.jcot.2018.11.014\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.12.075\n10.3390/jcs5050119"}

{"title": "Improved Sheet Resistance of Nanofiber-Based Transparent Conducting Electrodes Using Silver Nanowires.", "abstract": "There is an increased need for research on flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) because they are critical to next-generation electronic devices, such as wearable computers. In this study, highly conductive transparent conducting electrodes, based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber webs treated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and silver nanowires (AgNWs), were successfully fabricated. Transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) were obtained by a brush-painting process using different weight ratios of a AgNWs to PEDOT:PSS solution, and the surface, electrical, optical, and chemical properties, as well as the tensile strength of the samples, were determined. It was found that the electrical conductivity of the samples improved as the AgNW content increased, but the light transmittance decreased. In this work, there was a slight decrease in the optical properties and a considerable increase in the electrical properties due to the hybridization of AgNWs and PEDOT:PSS, compared to using only PEDOT:PSS. When considering both transparency and electrical conductivity, which are essential parameters of TCEs, sample PA2, which was treated by mixing AgNWs and PEDOT:PSS/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a ratio of 1:5 (16.67 wt% of AgNWs), was found to be the best sample, with a sheet resistance of 905 \u03a9/cm", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-11-14", "authors": ["SujinCha", "ByeolyiChoi", "EugeneLee", "GilsooCho"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13213856\n10.1108/09556220410520360\n10.1002/adma.201600358\n10.1021/nl102725k\n10.3390/nano8080628\n10.1039/C4TC00686K\n10.1016/j.solmat.2013.09.007\n10.1016/j.orgel.2016.11.003\n10.1002/aenm.201901204\n10.1039/C3TC32264E\n10.1021/acsami.6b00317\n10.1177/0040517517697647\n10.1002/adfm.201101775\n10.1088/0957-4484/24/7/075202\n10.1038/nnano.2013.84\n10.1002/app.20270\n10.1016/j.electacta.2019.07.055\n10.3390/polym12122870\n10.3390/polym12112705\n10.3390/polym12102212\n10.3390/polym13142329\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.125071\n10.1021/jp505626d\n10.1021/acsami.0c11165\n10.1002/adfm.201002290\n10.1039/C8TC00917A\n10.1016/j.displa.2013.08.007\n10.1016/j.orgel.2017.01.030\n10.1007/s10854-020-03351-5\n10.1007/s12221-020-9912-x\n10.1007/s12221-021-0042-x\n10.1007/s12221-020-0018-2\n10.1088/1757-899X/338/1/012026\n10.1039/c3cc46807k\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.05.004\n10.1007/s12034-011-0187-0\n10.1021/acsami.1c06081\n10.1016/j.solmat.2012.07.012\n10.1016/j.carbon.2019.01.073\n10.1039/C5TC00801H\n10.1007/s42452-019-1564-3\n10.1016/j.synthmet.2010.05.010"}

This article details the development of a COMSOL model for a guided wave-based temperature monitoring system, with a view to using the technology in the future for the temperature monitoring of nozzle guide vanes, found in the hot section of aeroengines. The model is based on an experimental test system that acts as a method of validation for the model. Piezoelectric wedge transducers were used to excite the S0 Lamb wave mode in an aluminium plate, which was temperature controlled using a hot plate. Time of flight measurements were carried out in MATLAB and used to calculate group velocity. The results were compared to theoretical wave velocities extracted from dispersion curves. The assembly and validation of such a model can aide in the future development of guided wave based sensor systems, and the methods provided can act as a guide for building similar COMSOL models. The results show that the model is in good agreement with the experimental equivalent, which is also in line with theoretical predictions.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-11-14", "authors": ["LawrenceYule", "BaharehZaghari", "NicholasHarris", "MartynHill"], "doi": "10.3390/s21217390\n10.1142/q0114\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1928\n10.3390/app9214602\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab1458\n10.1016/c2013-0-00155-7\n10.1177/0583102406075428\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1938\n10.3390/s20102778\n10.3390/s20030733\n10.1038/s41467-019-08491-9\n10.1115/GT2019-92087\n10.3390/app9061170\n10.1177/1475921719850641\n10.1177/016173468000200101\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2005.07.012\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2004.07.143\n10.1016/S0029-5493(00)00421-0\n10.1109/ICSENS.2011.6126948\n10.1088/1361-6641/ab0a82\n10.1016/B978-0-12-395667-5.50010-6\n10.1017/CBO9781107273610\n10.1007/978-1-84882-784-4\n10.1063/1.1144929\n10.1557/proc-470-3\n10.1557/PROC-525-135\n10.1177/1461348419886189\n10.1016/C2011-0-05059-7\n10.1088/1361-6501/abda96\n10.3390/s19020383\n10.1063/1.4974577\n10.1117/12.483492\n10.1109/APEIE.2016.7802286\n10.1080/08927022.2018.1450983\n10.4071/HITEC-2012-THA25\n10.1098/rspa.2007.0048"}
{"title": "Analysis of Double Elastic Steel Wind Driven Magneto-Electric Vibration Energy Harvesting System.", "abstract": "This research proposes an energy harvesting system that collects the downward airflow from a helicopter or a multi-axis unmanned rotary-wing aircraft and uses this wind force to drive the magnet to rotate, generating repulsive force, which causes the double elastic steel system to slap each other and vibrate periodically in order to generate more electricity than the traditional energy harvesting system. The design concept of the vibration mechanism in this study is to allow the elastic steel carrying the magnet to slap another elastic steel carrying the piezoelectric patch to form a set of double elastic steel vibration energy harvesting (DES VEH) systems. The theoretical DES VEH mechanism of this research is composed of a pair of cantilever beams, with magnets attached to the free end of one beam, and PZT attached to the other beam. This study analyzes the single beam system first. The MOMS method is applied to analyze the frequency response of this nonlinear system theoretically, then combines the piezoelectric patch and the magneto-electric coupling device with this nonlinear elastic beam to analyze the benefits of the system's converted electrical energy. In the theoretical study of the DES VEH system, the slapping force between the two elastic beams was considered as a concentrated load on each of the beams.

{"title": "Experimental Characterization of Optimized Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters for Wearable Sensor Networks.", "abstract": "The development of wearable devices and remote sensor networks progressively relies on their increased power autonomy, which can be further expanded by replacing conventional power sources, characterized by limited lifetimes, with energy harvesting systems. Due to its pervasiveness, kinetic energy is considered as one of the most promising energy forms, especially when combined with the simple and scalable piezoelectric approach. The integration of piezoelectric energy harvesters, generally in the form of bimorph cantilevers, with wearable and remote sensors, highlighted a drawback of such a configuration, i.e., their narrow operating bandwidth. In order to overcome this disadvantage while maximizing power outputs, optimized cantilever geometries, developed using the design of experiments approach, are analysed and combined in this work with frequency up-conversion excitation that allows converting random kinetic ambient motion into a periodical excitation of the harvester. The developed optimised designs, all with the same harvesters' footprint area of 23 \u00d7 15 mm, are thoroughly analysed via coupled harmonic and transient numerical analyses, along with the mostly neglected strength analyses.

{"title": "Development of Low-Frequency Phased Array for Imaging Defects in Concrete Structures.", "abstract": "The nondestructive inspection of concrete structures is indispensable for ensuring the safety and reliability of aging infrastructures. Ultrasonic waves having a frequency of tens of kHz are frequently used to reduce the scattering attenuation due to coarse aggregates. Such low frequencies enable the measurement of the thickness of concrete structures and detection of layer-type defects, such as delamination, whereas it causes a lack of sensitivity to crack-type defects. In this paper, to realize the ultrasonic phased array (PA) imaging of crack-type defects, we fabricated a low-frequency (LF) array transducer with a center frequency of hundreds of kHz. To avoid the crosstalk between piezoelectric elements and dampen the vibration of each element, we adopted soft lead zirconate titanate (soft PZT) with a low mechanical quality factor. Subsequently, we optimized the geometry of each piezoelectric element using a finite element method to generate a short pulse. After validating the design in a fundamental experiment using a single-element transducer, we fabricated a 32-element array transducer with a center frequency of 350 kHz. To show the imaging capability of the LF array transducer, we applied it to a concrete specimen with a delamination. As a result, the PA with the LF array transducer clearly visualized the delamination, which could not be visualized using the PA with a 2.5 MHz array transducer. Furthermore, we applied it to a more challenging defect, a slit, which is sometimes used to simulate crack-type defects. As a result, the PA with the LF array transducer clearly visualized a slit of 1 mm width and 40 mm height in a concrete specimen. Thus, we demonstrated the usefulness of the LF array transducer for inspecting crack-type defects.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-11-14", "authors": ["YoshikazuOhara", "KosukeKikuchi", "ToshihiroTsuji", "TsuyoshiMihara"], "doi": "10.3390/s21217012\n10.1007/s10921-008-0036-2\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/113001\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2006.03.006\n10.1063/1.2426891\n10.1063/1.4816160\n10.7567/JJAP.53.07KC20\n10.2320/matertrans.I-M2014812\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.144301\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2017.07.007\n10.2320/matertrans.I-M2014810\n10.3141/2306-12\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000513\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2018.04.012\n10.4322/rbeb.2011.008\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.02.009\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1755\n10.1016/0041-624X(96)00064-9\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.12.014\n10.1063/1.4789235\n10.1063/1.4864892\n10.3390/s20154335\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112364\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2007)133:6(628)\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.06.060\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.09.012\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.08.008\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.02.007\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112086\n10.7567/JJAP.54.07HC05\n10.1063/1.4989725\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.102170\n10.7567/1347-4065/ab0adc\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.217\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.861\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.08.008\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2016.04.003\n10.1109/TSP.2015.2486742\n10.1515/phys-2020-0159\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00164-9\n10.1063/5.0021282\n10.1038/s41592-019-0572-y\n10.1121/1.415393\n10.1121/1.1568759\n10.1109/TIP.2007.899193\n10.1088/0266-5611/18/4/306\n10.1016/j.camwa.2016.05.036\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006574"}
{"title": "Surfaces with Adjustable Features-Effective and Durable Materials for Water Desalination.", "abstract": "Materials based on PVDF with desirable and controllable features were successfully developed. The chemistry and roughness were adjusted to produce membranes with improved transport and separation properties. Membranes were activated using the novel piranha approach to generate OH-rich surfaces, and finally furnished with epoxy and long-alkyl moieties via stable covalent attachment. The comprehensive materials characterization provided a broad spectrum of data, including morphology, textural, thermal properties, and wettability features. The defined materials were tested in the air-gap membrane distillation process for desalination, and improvement compared with pristine PVDF was observed. An outstanding behavior was found for the PVDF sample equipped with long-alkyl chains. The generated membrane showed an enhancement in the transport of 58-62% compared to pristine.

For the first time, this study reports on the comparative analysis of PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) electrospun scaffolds in terms of structural and piezoelectric properties as well as their in vitro performance. A dynamic impact test machine was developed, validated, and utilised, to evaluate the generation of an electrical voltage upon the application of an impact load (varying load magnitude and frequency) onto the electrospun PVDF (15-20 wt%) and P(VDF-TrFE) (10-20 wt%) scaffolds. The cytotoxicity and in vitro performance of the scaffolds was evaluated with neonatal rat (nrSCs) and adult human Schwann cells (ahSCs). The neurite outgrowth behaviour from sensory rat dorsal root ganglion neurons cultured on the scaffolds was analysed qualitatively.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Effect and Ignition Characteristics of Coal Mine Gob Roof Collapse.", "abstract": "Existing studies of coal self-ignition and impact frictional sparks do not provide valid support for the analysis of ignition sources in all cases of methane explosions in the gob. In this paper, the explosion in the gob of the Renlou coal mine is used to investigate the piezoelectric effect and ignition characteristics of roof collapse in identifying a new ignition source of gas explosion. Experimental and theoretical analyses conclude that the piezoelectric effect is produced by quartz, which is the main constituent of the roof sandstone. During the loading process, the piezoelectric effect and compressive strength are key factors in the gathering of free charges on rock tips. During rupture, the rock tip retains a large number of charges, forming a \u2033point-surface\u2033 effect, which triggers an electron avalanche accompanied by an orange-yellow spark lasting over 22 ms, far exceeding the ionization energy and ignition induction period of methane-air mixtures.

The PDA coating increased the wettability of the liquid electrolyte by improving the distribution of the ionic liquid electrolyte. This, in turn, enhanced the ion conductivity of the PGE as well as the stability of QS-DSSC. The PDA@PVDF nanofiber membrane exhibited a satisfactory ultimate tensile strength of 9.3 MPa with a failure elongation of 130%. Such high toughness provided excellent mechanical support for the PGE. Owing to the unique pore connected structure of nonwoven nanofibers as well as the reduced surface tension with the liquid electrolytes, the PGE-based QS-DSSC retained 95.7% of the short circuit current from the liquid-electrolyte-based DSSC and showed an energy conversion efficiency of 8.26%.

Owing to the membrane deflection property, concave spherical contours with variable radius of curvature can be obtained.

Wearable devices serve as an interface between humans and technology; however, this integration is far from seamless. These devices face various limitations such as size, biocompatibility, and battery constraints wherein batteries are bulky, are expensive, and require regular replacement. On-body energy harvesting presents a promising alternative to battery power by utilizing the human body's continuous generation of energy. This review paper begins with an investigation of contemporary energy harvesting methods, with a deep focus on piezoelectricity. We then highlight the materials, configurations, and structures of such methods for self-powered devices. Here, we propose a novel combination of thin-film composites, kirigami patterns, and auxetic structures to lay the groundwork for an integrated piezoelectric system to monitor and sense. This approach has the potential to maximize energy output by amplifying the piezoelectric effect and manipulating the strain distribution. As a departure from bulky, rigid device design, we explore compositions and microfabrication processes for conformable energy harvesters. We conclude by discussing the limitations of these harvesters and future directions that expand upon current applications for wearable technology. Further exploration of materials, configurations, and structures introduce interdisciplinary applications for such integrated systems.

Dysregulated lipophagy has been implicated in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Ajugol is an active alkaloid isolated from the root of Rehmannia glutinosa which is commonly used to treat various inflammatory and metabolic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ajugol on alleviating hepatic steatosis and sought to determine whether its potential mechanism via the key lysosome-mediated process of lipophagy. Our findings showed that ajugol significantly improved high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice and inhibited palmitate-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Further analysis found that hepatic steatosis promoted the expression of LC3-II, an autophagosome marker, but led to autophagic flux blockade due to a lack of lysosomes. Ajugol also enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and promoted the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome to improve impaired autophagic flux and hepatosteatosis. Mechanistically, ajugol inactivated mammalian target of rapamycin and induced nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), an essential regulator of lysosomal biogenesis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TFEB significantly abrogated ajugol-induced lysosomal biogenesis as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lipophagy.

In fitting the theoretical curve to the experimental one, various functions can be used to quantify and minimize the deviations between the curves. The analyses and calculations performed in this work have proved that the quality of the model, its parameters and consequently the information on the structure of the investigated polymer are considerably dependent on the shape of an objective function. It is shown that the best models are obtained employing the least-squares method in which the sum of squared absolute errors is minimized. On the other hand, the methods in which the objective functions are based on the relative errors do not give a good fit and should not be used. The comparison and evaluation were performed using WAXD curves of seven polymers: isotactic polypropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, cellulose I, cellulose II, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyamide 6.

It holds great promise for sonochemistry. However, the microtapered apertures in the center of the stainless steel substrate of mesh-type USB-PUT can lead to rapid atomization of solution, leakage of solutions containing surfactants and organic solvent through the apertures, and high background emission. Herein, we design a new type of USB-PUT by replacing the meshed stainless steel substrate with an apertureless stainless steel substrate. We have found that this apertureless USB-PUT can not only induce intense sonochemiluminescence (SCL) but can also enable sensitive luminol SCL detection of hydrogen peroxide which is practically impossible using mesh-type PUT because of the strong background SCL emission. By using this apertureless device to induce SCL and using smart phone as a detector, a visual hydrogen peroxide SCL detection method with a linear range of 0.5-50 \u03bcM and a detection limit of 0.32 \u03bcM is established. Moreover, the device can achieve the detection of glucose oxidase (GOD) activity and glucose by enzymatic conversion of glucose to hydrogen peroxide. The linear range of GOD detection is 1-200U/L with a detection limit of 0.86 U/L. The linear range of glucose detection is 0.5-70 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.43 \u03bcM.

Unlike conventional dual-mode stages that use piezoelectric (PZT)- and electromagnetic-combined or similar actuation mechanisms comprising two separate motion axes, the dual-mode actuation was developed by combining a PZT for a coarse motion and a fluidic pressure-fed mechanism (FPFM) for a fine motion and was implemented in a monolithic flexure stage fabricated by metal additive manufacturing. The FPFM actuates the flexure stage by pressuring the media in the fluidic channels created inside the flexure spring structures. Experimental tests were performed to investigate the performance of the dual-mode linear motion platform. The stiffness, damping, and frequency response functions of the dual-mode stage were experimentally characterized. The proportional-integral-differential control combined with dual-mode control was employed to control the position of the flexure stage while bidirectionally controlling the flow of compressed air for a fine motion. The FPFM motion showed a good response to 1\u00a0nm stepwise input (every 10 psi), and it was implemented to provide up to \u223c10\u00a0nm fine motion along with the PZT coarse motion (1 \u00b5m).

This method determines the energetically optimal spatial position, the hydrophobic thickness, and the radius of intrinsic curvature of a membrane-deforming protein structure by arranging it in a single or several sphere-shaped or planar membrane sections. In addition, it can define the lipid-embedded regions of a protein that simultaneously spans several membranes or determine the optimal position of a peptide in a spherical micelle.

{"title": "Piezo1 ion channels inherently function as independent mechanotransducers.", "abstract": "Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint, which indirectly suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other's spatial distribution and interact functionally. Here, we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Our data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that both at endogenous densities (1-2 channels/\u03bcm\nCells can sense a range of mechanical forces both inside and outside the body, such as the stroke of a fingertip or the filling of a lung. Pores on the surface of the cell called Piezo channels open up in response to this pressure. This allows ions to flood in to the cell and trigger a series of biochemical reactions that alter the cell\u2019s behavior. Piezo channels have a unique bowl-like structure that transforms the shape of the cell surface around them, potentially affecting how nearby proteins behave. Previous research had suggested that these channels might be unevenly distributed across the cell surface, and were predicted to modify each other\u2019s behaviors when tightly packed together. This cooperative response would have a significant impact on how cells sense mechanical force. To investigate if this was the case, Lewis and Grandl studied a mouse cell called Neuro2A which naturally produces Piezo ion channels. In the experiment, pressure was applied to different parts of the cell and the electric current generated by ions moving across the surface was recorded: the higher the electrical activity, the more ion channels present. This showed that Piezo channels are randomly distributed across the cell surface and do not tend to cluster together. The same Neuro2A cells were then engineered to produce up to one hundred times more Piezo proteins. Despite the channels being more densely packed together, how they responded to mechanical force remained the same. These results suggest that Piezo channels act independently and are not influenced by close proximity to one another. Lewis and Grandl propose that this property may ensure that all parts of the cell surface react to mechanical force in the same way.

The much lower temperature required in thermal treatment is attributed to the high reactivity of zinc acetate at nano dimension. The as-prepared ZnO-doped PVDF nanofiber mat shows excellent effect in the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B, comparable to ZnO particle thermally treated at 600\u00a0\u00b0C. Highly-oriented ZnO nanorods were obtained by further hydrothermal synthesis of the electrospun nanofiber mat, giving nanostructured ZnO of different morphologies well-aligned on the surface of organic nanofiber.

Mechanoreceptors are molecules that display status changes in response to mechanical stimulation, transforming physical cues into biological responses to help the cells adapt to dynamic changes of the microenvironment. Mechanical stimuli are responsible for shaping the tridimensional development and patterning of the organs in early embryonic stages. The development of the heart is one of the first morphogenetic events that occur in embryos. As the circulation is established, the vascular system is exposed to constant shear stress, which is the force created by the movement of blood. Both spatial and temporal variations in shear stress differentially modulate critical steps in heart development, such as trabeculation and compaction of the ventricular wall and the formation of the heart valves. Zebrafish embryos are small, transparent, have a short developmental period and allow for real-time visualization of a variety of fluorescently labeled proteins to recapitulate developmental dynamics. In this review, we will highlight the application of zebrafish models as a genetically tractable model for investigating cardiovascular development and regeneration. We will introduce our approaches to manipulate mechanical forces during critical stages of zebrafish heart development and in a model of vascular regeneration, as well as advances in imaging technologies to capture these processes at high resolution.

{"title": "Acoustic Emission Monitoring of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Composites with Embedded Sensors for In-Situ Damage Identification.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric sensors can be embedded in carbon fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) for continuous measurement of acoustic emissions (AE) without the sensor being exposed or disrupting hydro- or aerodynamics. Insights into the sensitivity of the embedded sensor are essential for accurate identification of AE sources. Embedded sensors are considered to evoke additional modes of degradation into the composite laminate, accompanied by additional AE. Hence, to monitor CFRPs with embedded sensors, identification of this type of AE is of interest. This study (i) assesses experimentally the performance of embedded sensors for AE measurements, and (ii) investigates AE that emanates from embedded sensor-related degradation. CFRP specimens have been manufactured with and without embedded sensors and tested under four-point bending. AE signals have been recorded by the embedded sensor and two reference surface-bonded sensors. Sensitivity of the embedded sensor has been assessed by comparing centroid frequencies of AE measured using two sizes of embedded sensors. For identification of embedded sensor-induced AE, a hierarchical clustering approach has been implemented based on waveform similarity. It has been confirmed that both types of embedded sensors (7 mm and 20 mm diameter) can measure AE during specimen degradation and final failure. The 7 mm sensor showed higher sensitivity in the 350-450 kHz frequency range. The 20 mm sensor and the reference surface-bounded sensors predominately featured high sensitivity in ranges of 200-300 kHz and 150-350 kHz, respectively.

Therefore, we propose a high-sensitivity pulse sensor that can measure the hemodynamic characteristics of the pulse wave and then estimate the blood pressure. When an arrhythmia occurs, the hemodynamics of the pulse wave are abnormal and change the morphology of the pulse wave. Our proposed sensor can measure the occurrence of ectopic beats from the radial artery, and the detection algorithm can reduce the error of blood pressure estimation caused by the distortion of ectopic beats that occurs when the pulse wave is measured. In this study, we tested patients with premature atrial contraction (PAC) or premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and analyzed the morphology of the pulse waves when the sensor detected the ectopic beats. We discuss the advantages of using the Moens-Korteweg equation to estimate the blood pressure of patients with arrhythmia, which is different from the oscillometric method.

Here in this paper, the considered energy harvesting device is designed as a piezoelectric cantilever beam with different piezoelectric materials in both bimorph and unimorph configurations. For both these configurations a single degree-of-freedom model of a kinematically excited cantilever with a full and partial electrode length respecting the dimensions of added tip mass is derived. The analytical model is based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and its output is successfully verified with available experimental results of piezoelectric energy harvesters in three different configurations. The electrical output of the derived model for the three different materials (PZT-5A, PZZN-PLZT and PVDF) and design configurations is in accordance with lab measurements which are presented in the paper. Therefore, this model can be used for predicting the amount of harvested power in a particular vibratory environment. Finally, the derived analytical model was used to compare the energy harvesting effectiveness of the three considered materials for both simple harmonic excitation and random vibrations of the corresponding harvesters. The comparison revealed that both PZT-5A and PZZN-PLZT are an excellent choice for energy harvesting purposes thanks to high electrical power output, whereas PVDF should be used only for sensing applications due to low harvested electrical power output.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-27", "authors": ["ZdenekMachu", "OndrejRubes", "OldrichSevecek", "ZdenekHadas"], "doi": "10.3390/s21206759\n10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00248-7\n10.1109/JPROC.2008.927494\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/018\n10.3390/s19224922\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.006\n10.3390/s20226685\n10.1680/jtran.16.00016\n10.1039/C3EE42454E\n10.1080/00150193.2015.997146\n10.1002/adma.201700767\n10.1140/epjst/e2019-800153-0\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00377\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/5/055006\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/6/065016\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaca56\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.014\n10.1109/JMEMS.2019.2921649\n10.1177/1045389X20942832\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009\n10.1155/2014/893496\n10.3390/s20205808\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.07.016\n10.3390/s19112572"}
{"title": "Monitoring Flexions and Torsions of the Trunk via Gyroscope-Calibrated Capacitive Elastomeric Wearable Sensors.", "abstract": "Reliable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective wearable sensors are desirable for continuous measurements of flexions and torsions of the trunk, in order to assess risks and prevent injuries related to body movements in various contexts. Piezo-capacitive stretch sensors, made of dielectric elastomer membranes coated with compliant electrodes, have recently been described as a wearable, lightweight and low-cost technology to monitor body kinematics. An increase of their capacitance upon stretching can be used to sense angular movements. Here, we report on a wearable wireless system that, using two sensing stripes arranged on shoulder straps, can detect flexions and torsions of the trunk, following a simple and fast calibration with a conventional tri-axial gyroscope on board. The piezo-capacitive sensors avoid the errors that would be introduced by continuous sensing with a gyroscope, due to its typical drift. Relative to stereophotogrammetry (non-wearable standard system for motion capture), pure flexions and pure torsions could be detected by the piezo-capacitive sensors with a root mean square error of ~8\u00b0 and ~12\u00b0, respectively, whilst for flexion and torsion components in compound movements, the error was ~13\u00b0 and ~15\u00b0, respectively.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-27", "authors": ["GabrieleFrediani", "FedericaVannetti", "LeonardoBocchi", "GiovanniZonfrillo", "FedericoCarpi"], "doi": "10.3390/s21206706\n10.1097/00007632-200012010-00018\n10.1093/occmed/kqg072\n10.5271/sjweh.1290\n10.1177/2472630319891128\n10.1561/2000000094\n10.3390/s141018625\n10.1038/s41566-018-0266-5\n10.1007/s00586-012-2312-1\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e3182a0dbc5\n10.1186/1743-0003-11-56\n10.3390/s151128435\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.06.017\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.09.015\n10.1109/JSEN.2004.837498\n10.1186/1743-0003-2-8\n10.1155/2018/7480528\n10.1155/2020/9231571\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183651\n10.3390/s17122708\n10.1016/j.ergon.2018.11.007\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103624\n10.1145/3306346.3322957\n10.3390/s21165453"}

{"title": "New approach in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using biosensor technology: a review.", "abstract": "Biosensors are analytical tools that transform the bio-signal into an observable response. Biosensors are effective for early detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection because they target viral antigens to assess clinical development and provide information on the severity and critical trends of infection. The biosensors are capable of being on-site, fast, and extremely sensitive to the target viral antigen, opening the door for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. They can screen individuals in hospitals, airports, and other crowded locations. Microfluidics and nanotechnology are promising cornerstones for the development of biosensor-based techniques. Recently, due to high selectivity, simplicity, low cost, and reliability, the production of biosensor instruments have attracted considerable interest. This review article precisely provides the extensive scientific advancement and intensive look of basic principles and implementation of biosensors in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, especially for human health. In this review, the importance of biosensors including Optical, Electrochemical, Piezoelectric, Microfluidic, Paper-based biosensors, Immunosensors, and Nano-Biosensors in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been underscored. Smartphone biosensors and calorimetric strips that target antibodies or antigens should be developed immediately to combat the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2. Wearable biosensors can constantly monitor patients, which is a highly desired feature of biosensors.

{"title": "Directional, Low-Energy Driven Thermal Actuating Bilayer Enabled by Coordinated Submolecular Switching.", "abstract": "The authors reveal a thermal actuating bilayer that undergoes reversible deformation in response to low-energy thermal stimuli, for example, a few degrees of temperature increase. It is made of an aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheet covalently connected to a polymer layer in which dibenzocycloocta-1,5-diene (DBCOD) actuating units are oriented parallel to CNTs. Upon exposure to low-energy thermal stimulation, coordinated submolecular-level conformational changes of DBCODs result in macroscopic thermal contraction. This unique thermal contraction offers distinct advantages. It's inherently fast, repeatable, low-energy driven, and medium independent. The covalent interface and reversible nature of the conformational change bestow this bilayer with excellent repeatability, up to at least 70\u00a0000 cycles. Unlike conventional CNT bilayer systems, this system can achieve high precision actuation readily and can be scaled down to nanoscale. A new platform made of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in tandem with the bilayer can harvest low-grade thermal energy and convert it into electricity. The platform produces 86 times greater energy than PVDF alone upon exposure to 6\u00a0\u00b0C thermal fluctuations above room temperature. This platform provides a pathway to low-grade thermal energy harvesting. It also enables low-energy driven thermal artificial robotics, ultrasensitive thermal sensors, and remote controlled near infrared (NIR) driven actuators.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["MichaelLeveille", "XinyuanShen", "WenxinFu", "KeJin", "MuharremAcerce", "ChangchunWang", "JacquelineBustamante", "Anneka MillerCasas", "YuanFeng", "Nien-HuiGe", "Linda SHirst", "SayantaniGhosh", "Jennifer QingLu"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202102077"}
{"title": "Effect of Liquid Crystalline Host on Structural Changes in Magnetosomes Based Ferronematics.", "abstract": "The effect of the liquid crystalline host on structural changes in magnetosomes based on ferronematics is studied using the surface acoustic wave (SAW) technique supported by some capacitance and light transmission measurements. The measurement of the attenuation response of SAW propagating along the interface between LC and the piezoelectric substrate is used to study processes of structural changes under magnetic field. The magnetosome nanoparticles of the same volume concentration were added to three different nematic LCs, 5CB, 6CB, and E7. Unlike to undoped LCs, the different responses of SAW attenuation under the influence of magnetic and electric fields in LCs doped with magnetosomes were observed due to characteristic structural changes. The decrease of the threshold field for doped LCs as compared with pure LCs and slight effects on structural changes were registered. The threshold magnetic fields of LCs and composites were determined from capacitance measurements, and the slight shift to lower values was registered for doped LCs. The shift of nematic-isotropic transition was registered from dependencies of SAW attenuation on temperature. The acoustic anisotropy measurement approved the previous supposition about the role of bulk viscosity in used SAW measurements. In addition, capacitance and light transmition investigations supported SAW results and pointed out conclusions about their magnetic field behavior.

{"title": "Numerical Investigation of Phononic Crystal Based Film Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators.", "abstract": "Film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR)-based filters have attracted great attention because they can be used to build high-performance RF filters with low cost and small device size. Generally, FBARs employ the air cavity and Bragg mirror to confine the acoustic energy within the piezoelectric layer, so as to achieve high quality factors and low insertion loss. Here, two-dimensional (2D) phononic crystals (PhCs) are proposed to be the acoustic energy reflection layer for an FBAR (PhC-FBAR). Four kinds of PhC structures are investigated, and their bandgap diagrams and acoustic wave reflection coefficients are analyzed using the finite element method (FEM). Then, the PhCs are used as the acoustic wave reflectors at the bottom of the piezoelectric stack, with high reflectivity for elastic waves in the specific frequency range. The results show that the specific PhC possesses a wide bandgap, which enables the PhC-FBAR to work at a broad frequency range. Furthermore, the impedance spectra of PhC-FBARs are very smooth with few spurious modes, and the quality factors are close to those of traditional FBARs with air cavities, showing the application potential of the PhC-FBAR filters with wide bandwidth and high power capability.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["LinhaoShi", "WeipengXuan", "BiaoZhang", "ShurongDong", "HaoJin", "JikuiLuo"], "doi": "10.3390/nano11102547\n10.1109/TMTT.2018.2854160\n10.1155/2018/7852896\n10.1109/TMTT.2012.2229292\n10.1088/1674-4926/37/2/021001\n10.1109/MMM.2008.927633\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.313\n10.1088/0957-0233/27/2/025101\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.2059\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.2486\n10.1103/PhysRevB.48.13434\n10.1016/S1369-7021(09)70315-3\n10.1016/j.surfrep.2010.08.002\n10.1016/j.ast.2017.11.048\n10.1038/378241a0\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1509798\n10.3390/photonics8080313\n10.1063/1.4907345\n10.1063/1.4861409\n10.3390/mi12010062\n10.1103/PhysRevE.73.065601\n10.1063/1.1893209\n10.1063/1.4958671\n10.1364/AO.52.007367\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2846810\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.04.003\n10.1103/PhysRevE.69.046608\n10.1142/S0217984917503572"}

However, the PVDF membrane has several problems such as low filtration performance, fouling resistance, and difficulty in precisely controlling the morphology of the pores and hydrophilicity. Therefore, we newly produced a water treatment PVDF membrane containing graphene oxide (GO) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to improve the filtration performance. Surface properties of the fabricated membrane such as morphology, and size of pores, hydrophilicity, and water flux of the membrane were investigated. Additionally, the performance of these membrane filters was evaluated for free residual chlorine, turbidity, chromaticity, magnesium, sulfate, and particulates class 1 according to drinking water management act criteria, respectively. A performance improvement of at least 108.37% was observed compared to the Pure PVDF filter module and anti-fouling effects due to the functional groups of GO and MWCNTs.

{"title": "Performance of Self-Healing Cementitious Composites Using Aligned Tubular Healing Fiber.", "abstract": "From the perspective of improving the self-healing method in construction, a tubular healing fiber was adopted as a container to improve the encapsulation capacity, which was available using a micro-capsule as a container. Knowing the direction of the stresses to which structure members are subjected, this research investigated the influence of aligning tubular healing fibers parallel to intended stress into a cementitious composite to increase the self-healing capability. For that, a healing agent was encapsulated into a tubular healing fiber made with polyvinylidene of fluoride resin (PVDF). Then, the healing fiber was combined with steel fibers to align both fibers together parallel to the direction of an intended splitting tensile stress when subjected to a magnetic field in a cylindrical cementitious composite. The alignment method and the key point through which the alignment of the healing fibers could efficiently improve autonomic self-healing were investigated. Since the magnetic field is known to be able to drag steel to an expected direction, steel fibers were combined with the healing fibers to form a hybrid fiber that aligned both fibers together. The required mixture workability was investigated to avoid the sinking of the healing fibers into the mixture. The healing efficiency, according to the orientation of the healing fibers in the composite matrix, was evaluated through a permeability test and a repetitive splitting tensile test. The aligned healing fibers performed better than the randomly distributed healing fibers. However, according to the healing efficiency with aligned healing fibers, it was deduced that the observed decreasing effect of the container's alignment on the specimen's mechanical properties was low enough to be neglected.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["RuMu", "Dogniman LandrySoro", "XiaoweiWang", "LongbangQing", "GuoruiCao", "ShaolinMei", "YongshuaiLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14206162\n10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.10.011\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.385-387.789\n10.1016/j.jmrt.2020.04.053\n10.1002/adma.201705679\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.08.086\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2014.01.005\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.08.036\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2005.03.008\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.107892\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.06.119\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.181\n10.3390/polym9120718\n10.3390/ma13245624\n10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2002)14:4(355)\n10.11648/j.ajasr.20170306.12\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.10.002"}
{"title": "Structural Integrity Assessment of Composites Plates with Embedded PZT Transducers for Structural Health Monitoring.", "abstract": "Active sensing using ultrasonic guided waves (UGW) is widely investigated for monitoring possible damages in composite structures. Recently, a novel diagnosed film based on a circuit-printed technique with piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers has been developed. The diagnostic film is a replacement for the traditional cable connection to PZT sensors and has been shown to significantly reduce the weight of the host structure. In this work, the diagnosed films were embedded into composite structures during manufacturing using a novel edge cut-out method during lay-up, which allowed for edge trimming after curing. In this paper, the effect of fatigue loading on the integrity of PZT transducers is initially investigated. The electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) properties at different fatigue loading cycles were used as the diagnostic measure for the performance of the sensors. At the same time, the behaviours of UGW were investigated at different fatigue loading cycles. It was found that the EMI properties and active sensing behaviours remained stable up to 1 million cycles for the force ranges of 0.5~5 kN and 1~10 kN. Next, the effect of embedding the diagnosed film on the mechanical properties of the host composite structure was investigated. Tensile and compressive tests were conducted and the elastic modulus of composite coupons with and without embedded PZT diagnosed films were compared. The elastic modulus of composite coupons with PZT diagnosed films embedded across the entire coupon reduced by as much as 20% for tensile tests and just over 10% for compressive tests compared to the coupons without embedded sensors. These reductions are considered the worst-case scenario, as in real structures the film would only be embedded in a relatively small area of the structure.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["TianyiFeng", "M H FerriAliabadi"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14206148\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.01.004\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.11.017\n10.21467/jmm.5.1.1-7\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.10.101\n10.1177/1475921719878850\n10.1177/1475921719887109\n10.1108/IJSI-11-2015-0052\n10.4273/ijvss.8.2.03\n10.1016/S0266-3538(02)00007-6\n10.3390/s20123410\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2015.10.024\n10.3390/ma10010032\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.01.027\n10.1108/AEAT-11-2017-0255\n10.1007/s10921-020-00720-2\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.11.002\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.07.005\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.01.008\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.06.003\n10.1080/19475411.2020.1830196\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.08.083\n10.1016/j.matpr.2020.03.081\n10.1142/S1756973715500134\n10.1115/1.2202157\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/020\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/11/115019\n10.1080/15376494.2013.864437\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/1/015022"}

{"title": "Structure Tuning and Electrical Properties of Mixed PVDF and Nylon Nanofibers.", "abstract": "The paper specifies the electrostatic spinning process of specific polymeric materials, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyamide-6 (PA6, Nylon-6) and their combination PVDF/PA6. By combining nanofibers from two different materials during the spinning process, new structures with different mechanical, chemical, and physical properties can be created. The materials and their combinations were subjected to several measurements: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to capture topography; contact angle of the liquid wettability on the sample surface to observe hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity; crystallization events were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to describe properties and their changes at the chemical level. Furthermore, for the electrical properties of the sample, the dielectric characteristics and the piezoelectric coefficient were measured.

{"title": "A Hybrid Structure of Piezoelectric Fibers and Soft Materials as a Smart Floatable Open-Water Wave Energy Converter.", "abstract": "An open-water wave energy converter (OWEC) made of a new soft platform has been developed by combining piezoelectric macro-fiber composites (MFCs) and a low-cost elastomer. In the past decades, numerous types of water wave energy conversion platform have been developed and investigated, from buoys to overtopping devices. These harvesters mainly use electromagnetic-based generators, and they have faced challenges such as their enormous size, high deployment and maintenance costs, and negative effects on the environment. These problems hinder their practicality and competitiveness. In this paper, a soft open-water wave energy converter is introduced which integrates piezoelectric MFCs and bubble wrap into an elastomer sheet. The performance of the OWEC was investigated in a wave flume as a floatable structure. The maximum 29.7 \u00b5W energy harvested from the small OWEC represents a promising energy conversion performance at low frequencies (<2 Hz). The elastomer was able to protect the MFCs and internal electrical connections without any degradation during the experiment. In addition, the OWEC is a foldable structure, which can reduce the deployment costs in real-world applications. The combination of no maintenance, low fabrication cost, low deployment cost, and moderate energy harvesting capability may advance the OWEC platform to its real-world applications.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["SinaBaghbani Kordmahale", "JitaeDo", "Kuang-AnChang", "JunKameoka"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12101269\n10.1063/1.4997306\n10.1016/j.enpol.2018.11.028\n10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.067\n10.1109/icrera.2013.6749722\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.092\n10.2118/194972-ms\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.05.016\n10.1109/citres.2010.5619855\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114902\n10.1109/TMAG.2019.2896105\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113829\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.059\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.089\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.077\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.006\n10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.11.014\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073\n10.1109/transducers.2011.5969869\n10.1126/sciadv.aap8576\n10.1002/mame.201800463\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.055\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115193\n10.5802/crmeca.74\n10.1016/j.energy.2017.12.159\n10.1063/1.4962979\n10.3390/mi11020143\n10.3390/mi2020274\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.011\n10.1002/we.2359\n10.3390/en12142770\n10.3390/jmse7070219\n10.1016/j.egypro.2019.04.005\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.078\n10.1016/j.eml.2017.05.002\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.284\n10.3390/en6052562\n10.1109/oceanse.2009.5278302\n10.3390/jmse4030051\n10.3390/jmse6020039\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.04.020\n10.1117/12.810682\n10.1002/app.47025\n10.1109/mwsym.2015.7166885\n10.1109/aps.2016.7696131\n10.1117/12.2213259\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/11/115025\n10.1016/j.mejo.2016.05.013\n10.1557/adv.2018.675\n10.3390/jmse4020035\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.046\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105890\n10.1038/s41598-020-77581-2\n10.3390/s19040890\n10.1016/j.mee.2017.10.005\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105052"}
{"title": "Experimental Demonstration of a Stacked Hybrid Optoacoustic-Piezoelectric Transducer for Localized Heating and Enhanced Cavitation.", "abstract": "Laser-generated focused ultrasound (LGFU) is an emerging modality for cavitation-based therapy. However, focal pressure amplitudes by LGFU alone to achieve pulsed cavitation are often lacking as a treatment depth increases. This requires a higher pressure from a transmitter surface and more laser energies that even approach to a damage threshold of transmitter. To mitigate the requirement for LGFU-induced cavitation, we propose LGFU configurations with a locally heated focal zone using an additional high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transmitter. After confirming heat-induced cavitation enhancement using two separate transmitters, we then developed a stacked hybrid optoacoustic-piezoelectric transmitter, which is a unique configuration made by coating an optoacoustic layer directly onto a piezoelectric substrate. This shared curvature design has great practical advantage without requiring the complex alignment of two focal zones. Moreover, this enabled the amplification of cavitation bubble density by 18.5-fold compared to the LGFU operation alone. Finally, the feasibility of tissue fragmentation was confirmed through a tissue-mimicking gel, using the combination of LGFU and HIFU (not via a stacked structure). We expect that the stacked transmitter can be effectively used for stronger and faster tissue fragmentation than the LGFU transmitter alone.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["Pil GyuSang", "DeblinaBiswas", "Seung JinLee", "Sang MinWon", "DongheeSon", "Jong GOk", "Hui JoonPark", "Hyoung WonBaac"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12101268\n10.1038/srep00989\n10.1063/1.3522833\n10.1002/adom.201800491\n10.1063/1.4873678\n10.1002/adfm.201601337\n10.1063/1.4964852\n10.1364/OL.44.001300\n10.1364/OL.44.006005\n10.1063/1.5106415\n10.1002/jbio.201200247\n10.1364/BOE.4.001442\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.08.033\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.01.028\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2009.07.001\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.09.004\n10.1063/1.4943369\n10.1063/1.4836315\n10.1103/PhysRevE.74.041603\n10.1016/j.crhy.2006.10.015\n10.1080/02656730701194131\n10.1109/TBME.2009.2028133\n10.1121/1.4900116\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.10.012\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2017.08.938\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2018.07.025\n10.1121/1.2166708\n10.1364/OE.24.019008\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.044007\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.03.004\n10.1121/10.0004302"}

{"title": "Design, Analysis and Experiment of a Bridge-Type Piezoelectric Actuator for Infrared Image Stabilization.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in the optical field due to their high precision, compact structure, flexible design, and fast response. This paper presents a novel piezoelectric actuator with a bridge-type mechanism, which can be used to stabilize the images of an infrared imaging system. The bridge amplification mechanism is used to amplify the actuation displacement, and its structural parameters are optimized by the response surface method. The control strategy of the image stabilization system is formulated, and the overall structure of the infrared image stabilization system is designed according to the principle of image stabilization and the control strategy. The prototype was fabricated and verified by a series of experiments. In the test, the laminated piezoelectric ceramics are used as the driving element, and its maximum output displacement was about 17 \u03bcm under a voltage of 100 V. Firstly, the performance of the piezoelectric amplification mechanism was tested, and the maximum displacement of the piezoelectric micro-motion mechanism was 115 \u03bcm. The displacement amplification ratio of the mechanism was 5.7. Then, the step distance and response time of the micro-displacement mechanism were measured by inputting the stepping signal. When the input voltage increased to 3 V, 5 V, and 7 V, the stepping displacements of the mechanism were 2.4 \u03bcm, 4.1 \u03bcm, and 5.8 \u03bcm. Finally, the image stabilization effect of the designed mechanism was verified by imaging timing control and feedback signal processing.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["MengxinSun", "YongFeng", "YinWang", "WeiqingHuang", "SongfeiSu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12101197\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.12.042\n10.1016/j.infrared.2018.09.025\n10.1016/j.optcom.2017.09.069\n10.1177/1077546320905494\n10.1016/j.cub.2016.08.059\n10.1007/s11042-017-5330-5\n10.3390/rs12010070\n10.1007/s11432-016-5541-9\n10.1016/j.mne.2018.11.005\n10.3390/s20092485\n10.1109/TCE.2007.4429206\n10.1016/j.neunet.2018.01.012\n10.1016/j.image.2018.07.001\n10.3390/s150101736\n10.1016/j.optcom.2017.04.044\n10.1016/j.optcom.2016.03.074\n10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.05.018\n10.1007/s11340-007-9103-3\n10.1016/j.amc.2018.04.001\n10.1016/j.imavis.2015.02.002\n10.1108/EC-11-2015-0345\n10.1007/s11760-018-1307-8\n10.1109/TCE.2014.6780919\n10.1016/j.conengprac.2018.03.013\n10.1016/S0094-5765(99)00208-8\n10.1109/TMAG.2017.2664144\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.024\n10.1364/OE.24.019949\n10.1063/1.5054107\n10.1088/1361-6641/aa9b53\n10.1007/s12541-020-00393-x\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/035027\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.10.035\n10.1109/TMECH.2014.2368789"}

The utilization of the magnetic circuit helps to enhance the response to the electric currents in the power cords. The high sensitivity of the sensor originates from the superposition of the Ampere forces and the amplified piezoelectric effect of the drum transducer. The feasibility of the sensor was verified by experiments. The device exhibits a broad 3 dB bandwidth of 67.4 Hz without an additional magnetic field bias. The average sensitivity is 31.34 mV/A with a high linearity of 0.49%, and the resolution of the sensor attains 0.02 A. The resolution is much higher than that of the previous piezoelectric heterostructure for two-wire power-cords. Error analysis shows that the uncertainty reaches 0.01865 mV at the current of 2.5 A.

{"title": "Anharmonic Effects on the Thermodynamic Properties of Quartz from First Principles Calculations.", "abstract": "The simple chemistry and structure of quartz together with its abundance in nature and its piezoelectric properties make convenient its employment for several applications, from engineering to Earth sciences. For these purposes, the quartz equations of state, thermoelastic and thermodynamic properties have been studied since decades. Alpha quartz is stable up to 2.5 GPa at room temperature where it converts to coesite, and at ambient pressure up to 847 K where it transforms to the beta phase. In particular, the displacive phase transition at 847 K at ambient pressure is driven by intrinsic anharmonicity effects (soft-mode phase transition) and its precise mechanism is difficult to be investigated experimentally. Therefore, we studied these anharmonic effects by means of ab initio calculations in the framework of the statistical thermodynamics approach. We determined the principal thermodynamic quantities accounting for the intrinsic anharmonicity and compared them against experimental data. Our results up to 700 K show a very good agreement with experiments. The same procedures and algorithms illustrated here can also be applied to determine the thermodynamic properties of other crystalline phases possibly affected by intrinsic anharmonic effects, that could partially invalidate the standard quasi-harmonic approach.", "journal": "Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["MaraMurri", "MauroPrencipe"], "doi": "10.3390/e23101366\n10.1007/978-3-540-68683-5_2\n10.1021/acsami.9b18555\n10.2138/am-1998-1-201\n10.1107/S0108768199008083\n10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00923.x\n10.1007/s00269-014-0711-z\n10.1107/S1600576716015351\n10.1007/s00410-017-1349-x\n10.2138/am-2018-6625CCBY\n10.1007/s00269-018-01018-6\n10.1515/zkri-2018-2112\n10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105201\n10.1111/jmg.12508\n10.1130/G39807.1\n10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105218\n10.1130/G46617.1\n10.2138/am-1995-3-404\n10.1007/s00269-010-0398-8\n10.1007/s12210-018-0744-1\n10.1002/wcms.1360\n10.1103/PhysRevB.73.235116\n10.1103/PhysRevB.37.785\n10.1021/jp050316z\n10.1524/zpch.2006.220.7.893\n10.1127/ejm/2019/0031-2851\n10.5281/zenodo.5061097\n10.1016/0016-7037(82)90383-0"}

Weak and abundant interfacial polarization interactions between the PVDF copolymer and the oxide layer allow continuous and adaptive configuration of the compartmented LM channels, enabling ultra-stretchability of the composites. The conductive LM-polymer composites can maintain their structural integrity with a high surface conductivity and small resistance changes under large strains from 1000% to 10\u2009000%. Taking advantage of their flexible processability under mild conditions and exceptional performance, our design strategy allows the scalable fabrication of conductive LM-polymer composites for a range of applications in wearable devices and sensors.", "journal": "Materials horizons", "date": "2021-10-23", "authors": ["ChunyanCao", "XinHuang", "DongLv", "LiqingAi", "WeilongChen", "ChangshunHou", "BoYi", "JingdongLuo", "XiYao"], "doi": "10.1039/d1mh00924a"}

When the shear stress and strain are ignored, the complex coupled vibration of the rectangular piezoelectric ceramic stack is simplified to three one-dimensional coupled vibrations by defining three mechanical coupled coefficients. The three-dimensional electromechanical equivalent circuit is established on the basis of the analysis. The resonance frequency equation which determines the vibration mode of the piezoelectric vibrator is derived and the resonance frequencies of different modes can be calculated. According to the resonance frequency equation of coupled vibration, the effects of the length, width, and thickness of the rectangular piezoelectric ceramic stack on the resonance frequency are analyzed.

{"title": "Evaluating Protein Fouling on Membranes Patterned by Woven Mesh Fabrics.", "abstract": "Membrane surface patterning is one approach used to mitigate fouling. This study used a combination of flux decline measurements and visualization experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of a microscale herringbone pattern for reducing protein fouling on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes. Thermal embossing with woven mesh stamps was used for the first time to pattern membranes. Embossing process parameters were studied to identify conditions replicating the mesh patterns with high fidelity and to determine their effect on membrane permeability. Permeability increased or remained constant when patterning at low pressure (\u22644.4 MPa) as a result of increased effective surface area; whereas permeability decreased at higher pressures due to surface pore-sealing of the membrane active layer upon compression. Flux decline measurements with dilute protein solutions showed monotonic decreases over time, with lower rates for patterned membranes than as-received membranes. These data were analyzed by the Hermia model to follow the transient nature of fouling. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) provided complementary, quantitative, spatiotemporal information about protein deposition on as-received and patterned membrane surfaces. CLSM provided a greater level of detail for the early (pre-monolayer) stage of fouling than could be deduced from flux decline measurements. Images show that the protein immediately started to accumulate rapidly on the membranes, likely due to favorable hydrophobic interactions between the PVDF and protein, followed by decreasing rates of fouling with time as protein accumulated on the membrane surface. The knowledge generated in this study can be used to design membranes that inhibit fouling or otherwise direct foulants to deposit selectively in regions that minimize loss of flux.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2021-10-23", "authors": ["AnnaMalakian", "Scott MHusson"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes11100730\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117604\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.09.058\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.03.021\n10.1016/j.memsci.2004.01.029\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.09.004\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.06.022\n10.1007/s11783-016-0855-9\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.01.038\n10.1002/pi.5828\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.10.046\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.04.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.03.012\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.055\n10.1080/01496395.2016.1201115\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117746\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.04.026\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.05.060\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.037\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.012\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.04.003\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.11.041\n10.1016/j.coche.2018.01.008\n10.1021/es3020309\n10.1016/j.polymer.2015.05.049\n10.1002/adma.200600882\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117761\n10.1002/app.45993\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.05.054\n10.1021/es061322r\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.06.024\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.07.038\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.11.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117602\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.10.010\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.03.053\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.06.008\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.10.059\n10.3390/membranes8040111\n10.1016/0376-7388(94)00265-Z\n10.1006/jcis.2000.7231\n10.1016/j.seppur.2015.10.056\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117596\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.046\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.077\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.09.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141282\n10.1021/la2024605\n10.1016/j.tsf.2010.11.081\n10.1002/bit.260440814\n10.1021/es071043j\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.12.001\n10.1016/j.seppur.2010.07.016\n10.1021/acsami.9b07764"}

Therefore, accurate, rapid, and robust diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are crucial to prevent further spread of the infection, alleviate the burden on healthcare and diagnostic facilities, and ensure timely therapeutic intervention. To date, several detection methods based on nucleic acid amplification have been developed for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. Despite the myriad of advancements in the detection methods for SARS-CoV-2, rapid sample preparation methods for RNA extraction from viruses have rarely been explored. Here, we report a rapid COVID-19 molecular diagnostic system that combines a self-powered sample preparation assay and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based naked-eye detection method for the rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. The self-powered sample preparation assay with a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride filter and dimethyl pimelimidate can be operated by hand, without the use of any sophisticated instrumentation, similar to the reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP-based lateral flow assay for the naked-eye detection of SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 molecular diagnostic system enriches the virus population, extracts and amplifies the target RNA, and detects SARS-CoV-2 within 60 min. We validated the accuracy of the system by using 23 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens.

DNA vaccines can achieve these criteria, but induction of strong immune responses has often required bulky, expensive electroporation devices. Here, we report an ultra-low-cost (<1 USD), handheld (<50 g) electroporation system utilizing a microneedle electrode array (\"ePatch\") for DNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The low cost and small size are achieved by combining a thumb-operated piezoelectric pulser derived from a common household stove lighter that emits microsecond, bipolar, oscillatory electric pulses and a microneedle electrode array that targets delivery of high electric field strength pulses to the skin's epidermis. Antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 induced by this electroporation system in mice were strong and enabled at least 10-fold dose sparing compared to conventional intramuscular or intradermal injection of the DNA vaccine. Vaccination was well tolerated with mild, transient effects on the skin. This ePatch system is easily portable, without any battery or other power source supply, offering an attractive, inexpensive approach for rapid and accessible DNA vaccination to combat COVID-19, as well as other epidemics.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2021-10-22", "authors": ["DengningXia", "RuiJin", "GauravByagathvalli", "HuanYu", "LingYe", "Chao-YiLu", "M SaadBhamla", "ChinglaiYang", "Mark RPrausnitz"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2110817118\n10.1101/2021.05.07.21256652"}

We found that cells adhered best to scaffolds consisting of nanosized aligned fibers. In addition, poling of PVDF-TrFE, which orients the fiber dipoles and renders the scaffold more piezoelectric, increased cell adhesion. Enzymatic treatments revealed that the plant cell wall polysaccharide, pectin, is largely responsible for cell adhesion to scaffolds, analogous to pectin-mediated cell adhesion in plant tissues.

The mechanotransduction process requires a range of special proteins termed mechanotransducers to convert mechanical forces into biochemical signals in cells. The Piezo proteins are mechanically activated nonselective cation channels and the largest plasma membrane ion channels reported thus far. The regulation of two family members, Piezo1 and Piezo2, has been reported to have essential functions in mechanosensation and transduction in different organs and tissues. Recently, the predominant contributions of the Piezo family were reported to occur in the skeletal system, especially in bone development and mechano-stimulated bone homeostasis. Here we review current studies focused on the tissue-specific functions of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in various backgrounds with special highlights on their importance in regulating skeletal cell mechanotransduction. In this review, we emphasize the diverse functions of Piezo1 and Piezo2 and related signaling pathways in osteoblast lineage cells and chondrocytes.

The C-PMUT shows two resonance peaks derived from the resonances of the active PMUT cell and the passive resonant cavity. Both of the two resonances vibrate at the first-order resonant mode. An equivalent circuit model is established considering the vibration of the resonant cavity and the crosstalk between the PMUT cell and the resonant cavity. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to verify the theoretical model. Bandwidth optimization has been operated and the -6 dB bandwidth is extended to more than 100% in liquid. Furthermore, the theoretical model of the C-PMUT array is established based on the C-PMUT cell. The FEA models of the C-PMUT arrays are proposed, and the -6 dB bandwidth of a 4 \u00d74 C-PMUT array is increased to 2\u00d7 compared to the traditional array.

The linearized hysteresis response enables us to extract depth-dependent spectra accurately. To validate, the complex dispersion of a fused silica plate was characterized with 2% error.

In particular, under an intense sunlight environment such as that experienced with outdoor exercise and sports activities, high near-infrared (NIR) reflectance to block sunlight energy influx along with high IR transmittance in textiles for substantial thermal emission from the human body would be highly desirable. This investigation demonstrates that a nanoscale geometric control of textile structure alone, instead of complicated introduction of specialty polymer materials and composites, can enable such desirable NIR and IR optical properties in textiles. A diameter-dependent Mie scattering event in fibers and associated optical and thermal behavior were simulated in relation to a nonwoven, nanomesh textile. As an example, a nanomesh structure made of PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) electrospun fibers with \u223c600 nm average diameter was examined, which exhibited a significant radiative cooling performance with over 90% solar and NIR reflectance to profoundly block the sunlight energy influx as well as \u223c50% IR transmittance for human body radiative heat dissipation. An extraordinary cooling effect, as much as 12 \u00b0C, was obtained on a simulated skin compared to the normal textile fabric materials.

{"title": "Inverse Domain-Size Dependence of Piezoelectricity in Ferroelectric Crystals.", "abstract": "Piezoelectricity of ferroelectric crystals is widely utilized in electromechanical devices such as sensors and actuators. It is broadly believed that the smaller the ferroelectric domain size, the higher the piezoelectricity, arising from the commonly assumed larger contributions from the domain walls. Herein, the domain-size dependence of piezoelectric coefficients of prototypical ferroelectric crystals is theoretically studied based on thermodynamic analysis and phase-field simulations. It is revealed that the inverse domain-size effect, i.e., the larger the domain size, the higher the piezoelectricity, is entirely possible and can be just as common. The nature of the domain-size dependence of piezoelectricity is shown to be determined by the propensity of polarization rotation inside the domains instead of the domain wall contributions. A simple, unified, analytical model for predicting the domain-size dependence of piezoelectricity is established, which is valid regardless of the crystalline symmetry, the materials chemistry, and the domain structures of a ferroelectric crystal, and thus can serve as a guiding tool for optimizing piezoelectricity of ferroelectric materials beyond the \"nanodomain\" engineering.

{"title": "A Piezoelectric Ionic Cocrystal of Glycine and Sulfamic Acid.", "abstract": "Cocrystallization of two or more molecular compounds can dramatically change the physicochemical properties of a functional molecule without the need for chemical modification. For example, coformers can enhance the mechanical stability, processability, and solubility of pharmaceutical compounds to enable better medicines. Here, we demonstrate that amino acid cocrystals can enhance functional electromechanical properties in simple, sustainable materials as exemplified by glycine and sulfamic acid. These coformers crystallize independently in centrosymmetric space groups when they are grown as single-component crystals but form a noncentrosymmetric, electromechanically active ionic cocrystal when they are crystallized together. The piezoelectricity of the cocrystal is characterized using techniques tailored to overcome the challenges associated with measuring the electromechanical properties of soft (organic) crystals. The piezoelectric tensor of the cocrystal is mapped using density functional theory (DFT) computer models, and the predicted single-crystal longitudinal response of 2 pC/N is verified using second-harmonic generation (SHG) and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The experimental measurements are facilitated by polycrystalline film growth that allows for macroscopic and nanoscale quantification of the longitudinal out-of-plane response, which is in the range exploited in piezoelectric technologies made from quartz, aluminum nitride, and zinc oxide.

The transmit and receive performance figure of merit (FOM) of an individual PMUT over operating frequency is modeled and validated using laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) measurements. Given a fixed cross section, the FOM inversely scales with frequency. The array aperture size is selected to obtain enough pressure and received signal to measure the radial artery wall reflection at a 5-mm depth in tissue. The 2-mm acoustic beamwidth provides enough lateral resolution for radial artery wall motion tracking. Single-line ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements with high time resolution, also called M-mode ultrasound imaging, are demonstrated to reproduce a known target motion profile with a precision of around 0.5 [Formula: see text].

{"title": "Passive Cavitation Detection With a Needle Hydrophone Array.", "abstract": "Therapeutic ultrasound and microbubble technologies seek to drive systemically administered microbubbles into oscillations that safely manipulate tissue or release drugs. Such procedures often detect the unique acoustic emissions from microbubbles with the intention of using this feedback to control the microbubble activity. However, most sensor systems reported introduce distortions to the acoustic signal. Acoustic shockwaves, a key emission from microbubbles, are largely absent in reported recording, possibly due to the sensors being too large or too narrowband, or having strong phase distortions. Here, we built a sensor array that countered such limitations with small, broadband sensors and a low-phase distorting material. We built eight needle hydrophones with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, diameter: 2 mm) then fit them into a 3-D-printed scaffold in a two-layered, staggered arrangement. Using this array, we monitored microbubbles exposed to therapeutically relevant ultrasound pulses (center frequency: 0.5 MHz, peak-rarefactional pressure: 130-597 kPa, pulselength: four cycles). Our tests revealed that the hydrophones were broadband with the best having a sensitivity of -224.8 dB \u00b1 3.2 dB re 1 V/ \u03bc Pa from 1 to 15 MHz. The array was able to capture shockwaves generated by microbubbles. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the array was approximately two times higher than individual hydrophones. Also, the array could localize microbubbles (-3 dB lateral resolution: 2.37 mm) and determine the cavitation threshold (between 161 and 254 kPa). Thus, the array accurately monitored and localized microbubble activities, and may be an important technological step toward better feedback control methods and safer and more effective treatments.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-10-15", "authors": ["ZhengJiang", "KritSujarittam", "Betul IlbilgiYildiz", "Robert JDickinson", "James JChoi"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3120263"}
{"title": "A new liquid sensor based on a piezoelectric resonator with a radial electric field.", "abstract": "The possibility of development a liquid sensor based on a piezoelectric resonator with radial concentric electrodes is shown. The specified resonator has a large number of resonance peaks corresponding to different vibrational modes. The influence of two types of liquid container with distilled water on the resonance characteristics of these vibrational modes is experimentally investigated. As a result, the optimal type of container and two vibrational modes with frequencies of 0.128 and 0.317\u00a0MHz were selected, which retain acceptable Q-factors in the presence of distilled water. The dependences of the resonance frequency and the maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance of these resonance peaks on the conductivity of the liquid were measured. It has been found that with an increase in the conductivity of the liquid, the resonance frequency of the parallel resonance initially remains practically unchanged, but after reaching a certain value of the conductivity of water, it decreases for both resonances. In this case, the maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance first decreases, reaches a minimum, and then increases in all cases. It is shown that using these dependences as calibration curves, one can unambiguously determine the conductivity of a liquid in the range of 45-5000 \u03bcS/cm.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-10-14", "authors": ["Boris DZaitsev", "Alexander PSemyonov", "Andrey ATeplykh", "Irina ABorodina"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106603"}

In contrast to triboelectric and piezoelectric generators, direct-current generators readily produce direct-current outputs and high currents that are crucial for integrating multiple energy-harvesting units in large scale and driving some types of devices. We are focusing on the relationship between Schottky barrier height and performance, systematically investigating the effects of various conductive polymers and electrodes on the outputs by both theoretical simulation and experiments. Tailoring the Schottky barrier height between conductive polymers and metal electrodes is demonstrated a significant approach to design the new DC generators. The preparation method of electrochemical deposition endows the generators flexibility, the linear relationship of current/voltage output vs. strain applied on the generators, combined with the large outputs offer advantages for the generator to work as flexible sensors. Furthermore, a mechanosensation-active matrix array based on direct-current generator for the strain monitoring demonstrated its promising prospects in flexible electronics.

In this regard, e-skin can be considered as a promising formfactor for developing highly sensitive and transparent pressure sensors.

{"title": "Microstructure Dependence of Output Performance in Flexible PVDF Piezoelectric Nanogenerators.", "abstract": "Flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators have attracted great attention due to their ability to convert ambient mechanical energy into electrical energy for low-power wearable electronic devices. Controlling the microstructure of the flexible piezoelectric materials is a potential strategy to enhance the electrical outputs of the piezoelectric nanogenerator. Three types of flexible polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric nanogenerator were fabricated based on well-aligned nanofibers, random oriented nanofibers and thick films. The electrical output performance of PVDF nanogenerators is systematically investigated by the influence of microstructures. The aligned nanofiber arrays exhibit highly consistent orientation, uniform diameter, and a smooth surface, which possesses the highest fraction of the polar crystalline \u03b2 phase compared with the random-oriented nanofibers and thick films.

{"title": "Modification of Mechanical and Electromechanical Resonances of Cellular Ferroelectret Films Depending on the External Load.", "abstract": "Ferroelectret films are cellular polymers with electrically charged pores that exhibit piezoelectric response. Among other applications, ferroelectret films have been widely used as active elements in air-coupled ultrasonic transducers. More recently, they have also been tested in water immersion. They show a promising wide frequency band response, but a poor sensitivity produced by the disappearance of the electromechanical resonances. This paper studies in detail the modification of FE films response when put into water immersion, both the mechanical and the electromechanical responses (the latter in transmission and reception modes). The lack of electromechanical thickness resonances when the films are put into water is explained as the result of the different profile of the modification of the polarization vector along the film thickness imposed by the large mechanical load produced by the water. This different electromechanical response can also be the reason for the subtle modification of the mechanical thickness resonances that is also observed and analyzed.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-10-14", "authors": ["Julio QuirceAguilar", "Tom\u00e1sG\u00f3mez \u00c1lvarez-Arenas"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13193239\n10.1080/00222338908051994\n10.1063/1.125308\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2016.09.021\n10.1088/0022-3727/37/4/013\n10.1063/1.3159039\n10.1063/1.4893367\n10.1088/0022-3727/38/4/020\n10.1063/1.1641171\n10.1080/00150190600737933\n10.1109/TDEI.2006.1714918\n10.1063/1.2735410\n10.1515/epoly.2008.8.1.487\n10.1063/1.3490788\n10.1002/adv.21686\n10.3390/s21134508\n10.5162/sensor09/v1/u1\n10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012030\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.040\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.016\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.01.014\n10.1109/FLEPS.2019.8792228\n10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716736\n10.1063/1.4850523\n10.1121/1.1354989\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2004.1417981\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.727\n10.3390/s130505996\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.06.044\n10.1063/1.4759052\n10.1179/1743676112Y.0000000021\n10.1088/0957-0233/26/9/095102\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.08.031\n10.3390/s20102979\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8926178\n10.3390/app10248771\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3025358"}
{"title": "Electrostatic Charge Retention in PVDF Nanofiber-Nylon Mesh Multilayer Structure for Effective Fine Particulate Matter Filtration for Face Masks.", "abstract": "Currently, almost 70% of the world's population occupies urban areas. Owing to the high population density in these regions, they are exposed to various types of air pollutants. Fine particle air pollutants (<2.5 \u03bcm) can easily invade the human respiratory system, causing health issues. For fine particulate matter filtration, the use of a face mask filter is efficient; however, its use is accompanied by a high-pressure drop, making breathing difficult. Electrostatic interactions in the filter of the face mask constitute the dominant filtration mechanism for capturing fine particulate matter; these masks are, however, significantly weakened by the high humidity in exhaled breath. In this study, we demonstrate that a filter with an electrostatically rechargeable structure operates with normal breathing air power. In our novel face mask, a filter membrane is assembled by layer-by-layer stacking of the electrospun PVDF nanofiber mat formed on a nylon mesh. Tribo/piezoelectric characteristics via multilayer structure enhance filtration performance, even under air-powered filter bending taken as a normal breathing condition. The air gap between nanofiber and mesh layers increases air diffusion time and preserves the electrostatic charges within the multi-layered nanofiber filter membrane under humid air penetration, which is advantageous for face mask applications.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-10-14", "authors": ["Dong HeeKang", "Na KyongKim", "Hyun WookKang"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13193235\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.03.038\n10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00046.x\n10.1016/j.jaerosci.2007.03.008\n10.1007/s42765-020-00049-5\n10.3390/membranes11040250\n10.1016/j.mser.2020.100594\n10.1021/acsanm.0c01562\n10.1039/C6RA24557A\n10.1034/j.1600-0668.2002.01136.x\n10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.01.001\n10.1002/smll.201401553\n10.1080/10962247.2013.858652\n10.1039/C9NR08851B\n10.1021/acsami.7b03047\n10.1021/acsami.9b05686\n10.1080/02786829708965505\n10.1016/j.isci.2019.05.024\n10.1039/D0EN00683A\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.01.121\n10.1021/acsami.8b16564\n10.1002/adfm.201909554\n10.1021/acsnano.5b06327\n10.1002/adfm.201706680\n10.1002/pen.23474\n10.3390/mi9100532\n10.3390/polym9120718\n10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00282\n10.1063/5.0011686\n10.1016/j.ssi.2016.05.020\n10.3390/polym11122033\n10.1021/jp4011026\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.06.096\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b01404"}

Recent research has shown that elastic properties of such structures can be determined with remarkable accuracy by utilizing the dispersive nature of guided acoustic waves propagating in them.

In this work, we present a new approach that requires only a pair of piezoelectric transducers used to measure the group velocities ratio of fundamental guided wave modes. A numerical model based on the spectral collocation method is used to fit the measured data by solving a bound-constrained nonlinear least squares optimization problem.

The monotonic relationship between the dielectric constant of the ceramic substrate and ambient temperature is the fundamental principle for wireless temperature sensing.

{"title": "Indirect Measurement of Loading Forces with High-Speed Camera.", "abstract": "In the last few decades, there has been a significant increase in interest in developing, constructing, and using structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. The classic monitoring system should, by definition, have, in addition to the diagnostic module, a module responsible for monitoring loads. These loads can be measured with piezoelectric force sensors or indirectly with strain gauges such as resistance strain gauges or FBG sensors. However, this is not always feasible due to how the force is applied or because sensors cannot be mounted. Therefore, methods for identifying excitation forces based on response measurements are often used. This approach is usually cheaper and easier to implement from the measurement side. However, in this approach, it is necessary to use a network of response sensors, whose installation and wiring can cause technological difficulties and modify the results for slender constructions. Moreover, many load identification methods require the use of multiple sensors to identify a single force history. Increasing the number of sensors recording responses improves the numerical conditioning of the method.

{"title": "Magnetoelectric Response of Laminated Cantilevers Comprising a Magnetoactive Elastomer and a Piezoelectric Polymer, in Pulsed Uniform Magnetic Fields.", "abstract": "The voltage response to pulsed uniform magnetic fields and the accompanying bending deformations of laminated cantilever structures are investigated experimentally in detail. The structures comprise a magnetoactive elastomer (MAE) slab and a commercially available piezoelectric polymer multilayer. The magnetic field is applied vertically and the laminated structures are customarily fixed in the horizontal plane or, alternatively, slightly tilted upwards or downwards. Six different MAE compositions incorporating three concentrations of carbonyl iron particles (70 wt%, 75 wt% and 80 wt%) and two elastomer matrices of different stiffness are used. The dependences of the generated voltage and the cantilever's deflection on the composition of the MAE layer and its thickness are obtained. The appearance of the voltage between the electrodes of a piezoelectric material upon application of a magnetic field is considered as a manifestation of the direct magnetoelectric (ME) effect in a composite laminated structure. The ME voltage response increases with the increasing total quantity of the soft-magnetic filler in the MAE layer. The relationship between the generated voltage and the cantilever's deflection is established. The highest observed peak voltage around 5.5 V is about 8.5-fold higher than previously reported values. The quasi-static ME voltage coefficient for this type of ME heterostructures is about 50 V/A in the magnetic field of \u2248100 kA/m, obtained for the first time.

It is based on a smart Lead Zirconate Titanate material that consists of a monolithic PZT (piezoelectric ceramic) wafer, which is a ceramic-based piezoelectric material. An experimental test rig consisting of a wind tunnel and a developed measurement system was used to conduct the experiment. The developed test rig allowed changing the air velocity around the tested bluff body and the frequency of forced vibrations as well as recording the output voltage signal and linear acceleration of the tested object. The mechanical vibrations and the air flow were used to find the optimal performance of the piezoelectric energy harvesting system. The performance of the proposed piezoelectric wind energy harvester was tested for the same design, but of different masses. The geometry of the hybrid bluff body is a combination of cuboid and cylindrical shapes. The results of testing five bluff bodies for a range of wind tunnel air flow velocities from 4 to 15 m/s with additional vibration excitation frequencies from 0 to 10 Hz are presented. The conducted tests revealed the areas of the highest voltage output under specific excitation conditions that enable supplying low-power sensors with harvested energy.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-14", "authors": ["Bart\u0142omiejAmbro\u017ckiewicz", "ZbigniewCzy\u017c", "Pawe\u0142Karpi\u0144ski", "Pawe\u0142St\u0105czek", "GrzegorzLitak", "\u0141ukaszGrabowski"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14195816\n10.1088/0957-0233/17/12/R01\n10.1109/JPROC.2008.927494\n10.1039/C5CS00580A\n10.1039/C3EE42454E\n10.1016/j.renene.2012.07.015\n10.1063/1.4854995\n10.24057/2071-9388-2020-03\n10.1021/nn4043157\n10.1126/science.1168245\n10.1088/1742-6596/1736/1/012032\n10.3390/en14133926\n10.1016/j.jsv.2011.06.021\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.086\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.044\n10.1007/s00542-013-2030-6\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025026\n10.1007/s11071-012-0540-x\n10.1007/s11071-011-0233-x\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.01.028\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055022\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112835\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab870e\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab4216\n10.1177/1045389X10366317\n10.1063/1.5127072\n10.1063/5.0012247\n10.1063/1.5007121\n10.3390/en13010091\n10.3390/s20226685\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.02.009\n10.1063/1.868188\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.245301\n10.1016/j.jsv.2018.05.046"}

{"title": "Ultrasonic Vibration-Assisted Ball Burnishing Tool for a Lathe Characterized by Acoustic Emission and Vibratory Measurements.", "abstract": "This paper focuses on a resonant system used to induce a low-amplitude movement and ultrasonic frequency to complement a ball burnishing process on a lathe. The system was characterized through the combination of different techniques. A full vibratory characterization of this process was undertaken with the purpose of demonstrating that the mechanical system-composed of the tool and the machine-does not present resonance phenomena during the execution of the operation that could lead to eventual failure. This dynamic analysis validates the adequateness of the tool when attached to an NC lathe, which is important to guarantee its future implementation in actual manufacturing contexts. A further aim was to confirm that the system succeeds in transmitting an oscillating signal throughout the material lattice. To this end, different static and dynamic techniques that measure different vibration ranges-including impact tests, acoustic emission measurement, and vibration measurement-were combined. An operational deflection shape model was also constructed. Results demonstrate that the only high frequency appearing in the process originated in the tool. The process was not affected by the presence of vibration assistance, nor by the burnishing preload or feed levels. Furthermore, the frequency of the assisting ultrasonic vibration was characterized and no signal due to possible damage in the material of the specimens was detected.

{"title": "Mechanical Behavior and Healing Efficiency of Microcapsule-Based Cemented Coral Sand under Various Water Environments.", "abstract": "The cracks in the cemented coral sand (CCS) would result in significant damage for the marine structures. In this study, the effective and efficiency of microcapsules in self-healing CCS under various water environments were investigated with a series of experimental tests. Firstly, a new preparation method was proposed to fabricate the microcapsules with a wide particle size distribution, which was adapted to the high porosity, large difference in pore size, and uneven distribution of CCS. Secondly, the mechanical properties of microcapsule-based CCS were examined by the uniaxial compressive tests and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests. The results indicated that the microcapsule could improve the initial strength of CCS. The CCS mixed with 3% of the microcapsule that synthesized under a rotating speed of 450 rmp had the highest compressive strength at the initial strain state. Finally, the healing efficiency of microcapsule for CCS was investigated in various environmental conditions, which were freshwater, seawater, and water of various pH values. The non-destructive experiment approach of the piezoelectric transducer (PZT) test was adopted to evaluate the healing efficiency of microcapsules. Experimental results indicated that the healing efficiency of microcapsules in freshwater and seawater were 75% and 59.56%, respectively. In contrast, the acid and alkali water environment would greatly reduce the healing efficiency of microcapsules in CCS.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-10-14", "authors": ["YueQin", "QiankunWang", "DongshengXu", "WeiChen"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14195571\n10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0001763\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119343\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.059\n10.1155/2020/4678376\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122673\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2021.106884\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.007\n10.1080/23311916.2015.1075686\n10.1016/S0008-8846(98)00087-8\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2016.01.006\n10.3389/fmicb.2015.01225\n10.1002/pc.24953\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.06.332\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.03.040\n10.1016/j.triboint.2015.12.011\n10.1038/35057232\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.04.008\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.09.091\n10.1007/s10114-004-0465-5\n10.3724/SP.J.1105.2008.00472\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.076\n10.3390/s18040932\n10.1016/j.jrmge.2020.09.007\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2021.104289\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.12.118\n10.1088/0370-1301/62/11/302\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2016.11.012\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2014.07.011\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.06.019\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.042\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2016.09.079\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2019.105866\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.09.008\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2017.10.019\n10.1109/TIM.2018.2813778\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2020.103865\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107091\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119836\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.030\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.124379"}

However, the existing detection approaches cannot satisfy demand of rapid detection of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) because of the long detection time and high cost. Herein, we proposed a new M. tuberculosis piezoelectric sensor based on AuNPs-mediated enzyme assisted signal amplification. A hairpin-shaped DNA duplex with a protrusion of the 3' end was designed. In the presence of specific 16\u00a0S rDNA fragment of M. tuberculosis, the hairpin probe was opened, which triggered the selective cleavage of hairpin probe by Exonuclease III (Exo III), resulting in the release of uncut DNA probe and target DNA. The released target DNA hybridized with another hairpin-shaped DNA duplex, and a new digestion cycle was started, thus generating large amounts of uncut DNA probes. The uncut DNA was pulled to the electrode surface by the hybridization with capture probe modified on the electrode. Subsequently detection probe labeled AuNPs was hybridized with uncut DNA and entered between the two electrodes. The AuNPs linked to hybridized detection probe were grown in the HAuCl", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2021-10-13", "authors": ["JialinZhang", "FengjiaoHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122902"}

{"title": "Unraveling Strain Gradient Induced Electromechanical Coupling in Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene Moir\u00e9 Superlattices.", "abstract": "Moir\u00e9 superlattices of 2D materials with a small twist angle are thought to exhibit appreciable flexoelectric effect, though unambiguous confirmation of their flexoelectricity is challenging due to artifacts associated with commonly used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). For example, unexpectedly small phase contrast (\u22488\u00b0) between opposite flexoelectric polarizations is reported in twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), though theoretically predicted value is 180\u00b0. Here a methodology is developed to extract intrinsic moir\u00e9 flexoelectricity using twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBG) as a model system, probed by lateral PFM. For small twist angle samples, it is found that a vectorial decomposition is essential to recover the small intrinsic flexoelectric response at domain walls from a large background signal. The obtained threefold symmetry of commensurate domains with significant flexoelectric response at domain walls is fully consistent with the theoretical calculations. Incommensurate domains in tDBG with relatively large twist angles can also be observed by this technique.

Smoother lithium-ion channels are necessary for solid polymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivity. The porosity and channel structure of the polymer film affect the transfer of lithium ions.

Here, we developed a simple synthesis approach toward wrinkled microporous polymer electrolytes by combining the amphoteric (water solubility and organic solubility) polymer in three polymer blends.

Two minor polymers, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and polyetherimide (PEI), formed close stacks, and Janus PVP was dispersed in the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix. The interfacial tensions between the three polymers were different, so stress was produced when they solidified. The solvent was evaporated to the top layer of the polymers when the temperature increased. The bottom layer wrinkled owing to the stress during solidification.

{"title": "Backward Data Transfer From Deeply Implanted Device Employing Ultrasonic Load Amplitude-Phase Shift Keying.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic transcutaneous energy transfer (UTET) is used to wirelessly energize low-power miniature implanted devices. Whenever backward data transfer from the implant is of interest, load modulation may be utilized. With load modulation, data is sent backward by imposing ultrasonic reflections from the implant-tissue contact surface. This may be achieved by imposing unmatched electrical load over the implanted transducer electrical terminals. In order to sustain sufficient ultrasonic average power harvesting also during backward data transfer, only a small portion of the impinging ultrasonic energy is allowed to reflect backward. Previous work focused primarily on load modulation via ON- OFF keying (OOK). Herein, it is further shown that phase shift keying can be realized by exploiting the phase characteristics of a matched transducer around its vibration resonance. Load amplitude shift keying (ASK) properly combined with load phase shift keying (LPSK) may be applied, for introducing energy-efficient, high-order signaling schemes, thus improving utilization of the ultrasonic channel. LPSK is realized by momentary imposing reactive loads across the implanted transducer electrical terminals, according to the bit stream of the data to be sent. In this work, LPSK with various constellations and coding are demonstrated, exploiting the acoustic impedance dependency of the implanted piezoelectric resonator on its electrical loading. To support the theoretical notion, a backward data transfer using two-state phase modulation at a bit rate of 20 kbit/s over an ultrasonic carrier frequency of 250 kHz is demonstrated, using finite-element simulation.

{"title": "Carbon Nanotubes Promote the Development of Intestinal Organoids through Regulating Extracellular Matrix Viscoelasticity and Intracellular Energy Metabolism.", "abstract": "The biological effect of engineered carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as beneficial biomaterials on the intestine, especially on its development, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the profitable effect of CNTs with a different graphene layer and surface modification on the 3D model of intestinal organoids and demonstrated that CNTs (50 \u03bcg/mL) promoted the development of intestinal organoids over time (0-5 days). The mechanisms involve the modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) viscoelasticity and intracellular energy metabolism. In particular, CNTs reduced the hardness of the extracellular matrix through decreasing the elasticity and increasing the viscosity as a result of elevated metalloproteinase and binding to a protein scaffold, which activated the mechanical membrane sensors of cells, Piezo, and downstream P-p38-yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway. Moreover, CNTs altered the metabolic profile of intestinal organoids and induced increased mitochondria activity, respiration, and nutrient absorption. These mechanisms cooperated with each other to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal organoids. In addition, the promoted effect of CNTs is highly dependent on the number of graphene layers, manifested as multiwalled CNTs > single-walled CNTs.

{"title": "A smart mask for active defense against airborne pathogens.", "abstract": "Face masks are a primary preventive measure against airborne pathogens. Thus, they have become one of the keys to controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Common examples, including N95 masks, surgical masks, and face coverings, are passive devices that minimize the spread of suspended pathogens by inserting an aerosol-filtering barrier between the user's nasal and oral cavities and the environment. However, the filtering process does not adapt to changing pathogen levels or other environmental factors, which reduces its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the limitations of passive masks by proposing ADAPT, a smart IoT-enabled \"active mask\". This wearable device contains a real-time closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes near the mask by using an on-board particulate matter (PM) sensor. It then intelligently mitigates the threat by using mist spray, generated by a piezoelectric actuator, to load nearby aerosol particles such that they rapidly fall to the ground. The system is controlled by an on-board micro-controller unit that collects sensor data, analyzes it, and activates the mist generator as necessary. A custom smartphone application enables the user to remotely control the device and also receive real-time alerts related to recharging, refilling, and/or decontamination of the mask before reuse. Experimental results on a working prototype confirm that aerosol clouds rapidly fall to the ground when the mask is activated, thus significantly reducing PM counts near the user.

{"title": "Experimental-numerical analysis of cell adhesion-mediated electromechanical stimulation on piezoelectric nanofiber scaffolds.", "abstract": "Electrospun nanofibers exhibiting piezoelectricity are a specific class of smart materials which could provide electric stimulation to cells in a noninvasive way and contribute to tissue regeneration. During cell-material interaction, the materials display electromechanical behavior by transforming cell adhesion force into surface charge. In the process, how the cell adhesion states and the electromechanical properties of scaffolds determine the actual piezoelectric potential implemented on a cell is still unclear. Herein, we fabricated piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofiber scaffolds with different topographies, and investigated their influences on cell morphology and cell adhesion-mediated electromechanical stimulation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). Our results demonstrated that MSC seeded on aligned piezoelectric nanofibers exhibited elongated morphology combined with higher intracellular calcium activity than those adhered on random nanofibers with rounded shape. The underlying mechanism was further quantitatively analyzed using a three-dimensional (3D) finite element method with respect to cell adhesion states and architecture parameters of nanofiber scaffolds. The results suggested that cell morphology and cell adhesion force influenced the piezoelectric output through modulating the location and magnification of force implemented on the scaffolds. In addition, the change of alignment, pore size and diameter of the nanofiber network could alter the mechanical property of the scaffolds, and then bias the actual piezoelectric output experienced by a cell. These findings provide new insights for probing the mechanism of cell self-stimulation on piezoelectric scaffolds, and pave the way for rational design of piezoelectric scaffolds for cell regulation and tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2021-10-04", "authors": ["TianpengXie", "QingjieLiu", "GuilanXue", "YimengZhang", "JunyuZhou", "ZixinZhu", "XueGou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110777"}

However, filter performance can be impacted by properties of both the membrane material and the solution being filtered, requiring extensive multi-factor studies to optimize the filtration process for a given drug product. Here, we report the use of a modified bundle of capillaries approximation to predict filter performance. The model is directly applicable for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian solutions and does not require assumptions of steady state. Using a hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter as a test case, we show that the model fitting parameters align with expected values and both flux and shear are well predicted. Moreover, two case studies are presented to demonstrate the model's utility for filtration process optimization: 1) protein adsorption of an antibody formulation and 2) filter fouling of a 1% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution. In both cases, the model was able to accurately identify optimal filtration parameters to reduce the amount of adsorption or improve the filter capacity, respectively.

In order to simplify the control system, a surface-bonded type single-phase excited piezoelectric transducer operating in the longitudinal-bending coupling vibration is proposed, modeled, and validated in this study. Using the asymmetrical excitation effect, the longitudinal-bending coupled vibration is generated in the proposed piezoelectric transducer only applied with a single-phase electrical signal, leading to the production of the elliptical motion at its driving tip. The proposed transducer holds the advantages of compact structure, simple control system, and low manufacturing costs. The transfer matrix method, which is an efficient and fast semi-analytic computation solution, is employed to develop a dynamic model for the proposed transducer in this study in order to provide a general modeling method for surface-bonded type piezoelectric transducers operating with the longitudinal-bending coupled vibration. A novel longitudinal-bending coupled vibration transfer matrix is created first for surface-bonded type piezoelectric composite element. Then, a general semi-analytical electromechanical coupling model is developed to analyze dynamic behaviors of the proposed piezoelectric transducer. Finally, experimental validation is carried out on the prototype of the proposed piezoelectric transducer and compared with the calculation results using the developed transfer matrix model.

{"title": "In-situ 3D fouling visualization of membrane distillation treating industrial textile wastewater by optical coherence tomography imaging.", "abstract": "Membrane fouling, which is caused by the deposition of particles on the membrane surface or pores, reduces system performance in membrane distillation (MD) applications, resulting in increased operational costs, poor recovery, and system failure. Optical Coherence Tomography enables in-situ foulant monitoring in both 2D and 3D, however, the 2D images can only determine fouling layer thickness in severe fouling. Therefore, in this study, an advanced 3D imaging analysis technique using intensity range filters was proposed to quantify fouling layer formation during MD through the use of a single 3D image. This approach not only reduces computational power requirements, but also successfully separated the fouling layer from the membrane at the microscale. Thus, the thickness, fouling index, and fouling layer coverage can be evaluated in real time. To test this approach, Polyvinylidene fluoride (C-PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene (C-PTFE) membranes were used to treat a feed consisting of industrial textile wastewater. Thin and disperse foulants was observed on the C-PTFE, with a 22\u00a0\u00b5m thick fouling layer which could not be observed using 2D images after 24\u00a0h. Moreover, the C-PTFE demonstrated better antifouling ability than the C-PVDF as demonstrated by its lower fouling index, which was also supported by surface energy characterization.

Herein, we report a facile and scalable approach for fabricating a Janus MD membrane comprising a dense polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) surface layer and a hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane substrate. By testing the Janus membrane in direct contact MD experiments using feeds containing a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant or/and mineral oil, we demonstrated that the dense Janus membrane can simultaneously resist wetting and fouling. This method represents the simplest approach to date for fabricating MD membranes with simultaneous wetting and fouling resistance. Importantly, we also unveil the mechanism of wetting resistance by measuring the breakthrough pressure and surfactant permeation (through the PVA layer) and found that wetting resistance imparted by a dense hydrophilic layer is attributable to capillary pressure. This new insight will potentially change the paradigm of fabricating wetting-resistant membranes and enable robust applications of MD and other membrane contactor processes facing challenges of pore wetting or/and membrane fouling.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2021-10-02", "authors": ["DejunFeng", "YuanmiaoliangChen", "ZhangxinWang", "ShihongLin"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.1c04443"}

{"title": "Use of Inguinal Hernia Mesh (DynaMesh-ENDOLAP) in Immediate Implant-based Breast Reconstruction.", "abstract": "The rate of immediate implant-based breast reconstruction after mastectomy is increasing, and providing enough coverage for the implant is mandatory; however the choice of appropriate mesh for implant coverage is controversial. Considering the high cost and the limited availability of breast-dedicated meshes in our country, we conducted this study to investigate the consequences of using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh designed for endoscopic and laparoscopic hernia repair (ENDOLAP) as a coverage for breast prostheses in breast reconstruction.\nA retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on data of patients who had underwent immediate implant-based breast reconstruction between 2012 and 2019. After skin sparing mastectomy and subpectoral implant insertion, the exposed lower and lateral parts were covered with the mesh.\nSeventy-nine reconstructions were performed on 62 patients. The average follow-up was 31.9 months (ranges 6-102 months). Postoperative complications including small flap necrosis (3.8%), seroma (8.9%), infection (5.1%), hematoma (3.8%), malposition (1.3%), rippling (1.3%), grade two and three capsular contracture (2.5%), and chronic pain (1.3%) occurred in 19% of the operated breasts. The complication rate requiring intervention was 5.3%, and no implant loss was observed. None of the patients who received radiation developed complications.\nENDOLAP mesh is a cost-effective and safe option for implant coverage in immediate implant-based breast reconstruction, with an acceptable complication rate.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

{"title": "Real-Time Detection and Control of Microchannel Resonance Frequency in Acoustic Trapping Systems by Monitoring Amplifier Supply Currents.", "abstract": "The utilization of bulk acoustic waves from a piezoelectric transducer for selective particle trapping under flow in a microchannel is limited by the high sensitivity of the resonance frequency to tolerances in device geometry, drift during trapping, and variations in the local flow or sample conditions in each channel. This is addressed by detecting the resonance condition based on the impedance minimum obtained by monitoring the amplitude of the stimulation voltage across the piezo transducer and utilizing real-time feedback to control the stimulation frequency. However, this requires an overlap in the frequency bandwidth of the detection and the stimulation system and is also limited by the decline in the acoustic trapping power when the stimulation and resonance frequency measurement are conducted simultaneously. Instead, we present a novel circuit implementation for on-chip real-time resonance frequency measurement and feedback control based on monitoring the current drawn from the amplifier used to stimulate the piezo transducer, since the need for high measurement sensitivity in this mode does not lower the power available for stimulation of the transducer. The enhanced level of control of acoustic trapping utilizing this current mode is validated for various localized channel perturbations, including drift, wash steps, and buffer swaps, as well as for selective sperm cell trapping from a heterogeneous sample that includes lysed epithelial cells.", "journal": "ACS sensors", "date": "2021-09-30", "authors": ["VahidFarmehini", "SadieKiendzior", "James PLanders", "Nathan SSwami"], "doi": "10.1021/acssensors.1c01580"}

MWCNTs played a very important role in distributing ZnO fillers in the PVDF matrix more homogeneously and increased the connection capability. Enhancement of the piezoelectric phase, dielectric permittivity, ferroelectric polarization, energy storage density and mechanical energy harvesting performance of ZnO-PVDF composites after the addition of MWCNTs was confirmed from the respective characterization studies.

{"title": "Sub-nanosecond acousto-electric carrier redistribution dynamics and transport in polytypic GaAs nanowires.", "abstract": "The authors report on a combined structural, optical and acousto-electric study of polytypic GaAs nanowires. Two types of nanowires with different zincblende and wurtzite crystal phase mixing are identified by transmission electron microscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The nanowires exhibit characteristic recombination channels which are assigned to different types of spatially direct recombination (electron and hole within the same crystal phase segment) and spatially indirect recombination (electron and holes localized in different segments). Contact-free acousto-optoelectric spectroscopy is employed to resolve spatiotemporal charge carrier dynamics between different recombination channels induced by a piezoelectric surface acoustic wave. The observed suppression of the emission and its dynamic temporal modulation shows unambiguous fingerprints of the local bandedge variations induced by the crystal phase mixing. A nanowire, which exhibits a variation from a near-pristine zinc blende crystal structure to a highly mixed crystal phase, shows a clear dependence on the propagation direction of the acoustic wave. In contrast, no pronounced directionality is found for a nanowire with an extended near-pristine zincblende segment. The experimental findings are corroborated by solving the drift and diffusion equations of electrons and holes induced by the surface acoustic wave. The key characteristics observed in our experimental data are well reproduced in the numerical simulations by assuming two general bandedge modulations and realistic parameters for the bandedge discontinuities and transport mobilities of electrons and holes. This evidences that even all relevant physical processes are accounted for in the model.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2021-09-30", "authors": ["Maximilian MSonner", "MaximilianGnedel", "Johannes CBerlin", "DanielRudolph", "GregorKoblm\u00fcller", "Hubert JKrenner"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ac2ac2"}

Nevertheless, membrane fouling in AnMBRs has been a major concern. In this study, the surfaces of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes were modified with tannic acid (TA) and Cu(II) at various molar ratios of TA to Cu(II), including 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3.

The modified membrane with a TA-to-Cu(II) molar ratio of 1:3 had high hydrophilicity with certain antibacterial properties; therefore, it was selected to be further tested in an AnMBR along with an unmodified membrane.

{"title": "The Effect of Micro-Inertia and Flexoelectricity on Love Wave Propagation in Layered Piezoelectric Structures.", "abstract": "The non-classical linear governing equations of strain gradient piezoelectricity with micro-inertia effect are used to investigate Love wave propagation in a layered piezoelectric structure. The influence of flexoelectricity and micro-inertia effect on the phase wave velocity in a thin homogeneous flexoelectric layer deposited on a piezoelectric substrate is investigated. The dispersion relation for Love waves is obtained. The phase velocity is numerically calculated and graphically illustrated for the electric open-circuit and short-circuit conditions and for distinct material properties of the layer and substrate. The influence of direct flexoelectricity, micro-inertia effect, as well as the layer thickness on Love wave propagation is studied individually. It is found that flexoelectricity increases the Love-wave phase velocity, while the micro-inertia effect reduces its value. These effects become more significant for Love waves with shorter wavelengths and small guiding layer thicknesses.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["OlhaHrytsyna", "JanSladek", "VladimirSladek"], "doi": "10.3390/nano11092270\n10.3934/dcdss.2016005\n10.1016/j.jsv.2004.08.044\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2009.06.018\n10.1016/j.jsv.2004.10.040\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.04.011\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2007.01.030\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2008.11.002\n10.1177/1077546313513626\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.09.004\n10.1016/j.jsv.2007.11.037\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.10.001\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.10.001\n10.1007/s00707-020-02831-3\n10.1016/S0020-7683(00)00009-3\n10.1007/s00707-004-0128-8\n10.1007/s00707-006-0435-3\n10.1177/1077546309341154\n10.1007/s00707-004-0081-6\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.03.006\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.11.009\n10.1016/0020-7225(89)90030-X\n10.1080/14786435.2017.1378825\n10.1088/2053-1591/ab3f52\n10.1080/17455030.2019.1699676\n10.1016/S0165-2125(99)00035-9\n10.1016/S0020-7683(03)00054-4\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2014.12.020\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.08.008\n10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106105\n10.1016/S0997-7538(00)00201-1\n10.1007/s10659-017-9636-3\n10.1016/j.jmps.2010.03.001\n10.1103/PhysRevB.77.125424\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2011.03.006\n10.1177/1081286513497616\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2016.08.003\n10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0001184\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.113528\n10.1177/1081286515588638\n10.1088/1361-665X/aacd34\n10.1007/s00707-020-02901-6\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.00048.x\n10.1016/j.jmps.2014.11.012"}

Nevertheless, with application expansion, the requirements for material performance also increase. Although the development of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) to achieve these functions is challenging, it has attracted attention because of its excellent performance. This study combined the CFRP electrode with epoxy resin containing potassium sodium niobate piezoelectric nanoparticles and successfully polarized the composite sample. Furthermore, a three-point bending method was applied to compare the bending behavior of the samples. The peak output voltage produced by the maximum bending stress of 98.4 MPa was estimated to be 0.51 mV. Additionally, a conversion efficiency of 0.01546% was obtained. The results showed that the piezoelectric resin with CFRPs as the electrode exhibited stress self-inductance characteristics.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Finite Element Analysis and Characterization of Quasi-Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators.", "abstract": "In this work, three-dimensional finite element analysis (3D FEA) of quasi-surface acoustic wave (QSAW) resonators with high accuracy is reported. The QSAW resonators consist of simple molybdenum (Mo) interdigitated transducers (IDT) on solidly mounted stacked layers of AlN/Mo/Si. Different to the SAW resonators operating in the piezoelectric substrates, the reported resonators are operating in the QSAW mode, since the IDT-excited Rayleigh waves not only propagate in the thin piezoelectric layer of AlN, but also penetrate the Si substrate. Compared with the commonly used two-dimensional (2D) FEA approach, the 3D FEA method reported in this work shows high accuracy, in terms of the resonant frequency, temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF), effective coupling coefficient (keff2) and frequency response. The fabricated QSAW resonator has demonstrated a keff2 of 0.291%, series resonant frequency of 422.50 MHz, and TCF of -23.418 ppm/\u00b0C in the temperature range between 30 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C, for the design of wavelength at 10.4 \u03bcm.

To realize the measurement of multiple physical quantities while eliminating the measurement error caused by external devices, this paper proposes a measurement method for the lumped-element equivalent parameters of QCM resonators without the need for extra external devices. Accordingly, a numerical method for solving nonlinear equations with fewer data points required and a higher accuracy was adopted. A standard crystal resonator parameter extraction experiment is described. The extracted parameters were consistent with the nominal parameters, which confirms the accuracy of this method.

{"title": "Positioning Performance of a Sub-Arc-Second Micro-Drive Rotary System.", "abstract": "In the macro/micro dual-drive rotary system, the micro-drive system compensates for the position error of the macro-drive system. To realize the sub-arc-second (i.e., level of 1\u2033-0.1\u2033) positioning of the macro/micro dual-drive rotary system, it is necessary to study the positioning performance of the sub-arc-second micro-drive rotary system. In this paper, we designed a sub-arc-second micro-drive rotary system consisting of a PZT (piezoelectric actuator) and a micro rotary mechanism, and used simulation and experimental methods to study the positioning performance of the system. First, the micro-drive rotary system was developed to provide ultra-precise rotary motion. In this system, the PZT has ultrahigh resolution at a level of 0.1 nanometers in linear motion; a micro rotating mechanism was designed according to the composite motion principle of the flexible hinge, which could transform the linear motion of piezoelectric ceramics into rotating motion accurately. Second, the drive performance was analyzed based on the drive performance experiment. Third, kinematics, simulation, and experiments were carried out to analyze the transformation performance of the system.

The results show that the system can be mono-stable, bi-stable and tri-stable by adjusting the horizontal or vertical spacing of the magnets under proper excitation. The potential well of the system in the tri-stable state is shallow, and it is easier to achieve a large-amplitude response.

{"title": "A Multi-Fidelity Model for Simulations and Sensitivity Analysis of Piezoelectric Inkjet Printheads.", "abstract": "The ink drop generation process in piezoelectric droplet-on-demand devices is a complex multiphysics process. A fully resolved simulation of such a system involves a coupled fluid-structure interaction approach employing both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural mechanics (CSM) models; thus, it is computationally expensive for engineering design and analysis. In this work, a simplified lumped element model (LEM) is proposed for the simulation of piezoelectric inkjet printheads using the analogy of equivalent electrical circuits. The model's parameters are computed from three-dimensional fluid and structural simulations, taking into account the detailed geometrical features of the inkjet printhead. Inherently, this multifidelity LEM approach is much faster in simulations of the whole inkjet printhead, while it ably captures fundamental electro-mechanical coupling effects. The approach is validated with experimental data for an existing commercial inkjet printhead with good agreement in droplet speed prediction and frequency responses. The sensitivity analysis of droplet generation conducted for the variation of ink channel geometrical parameters shows the importance of different design variables on the performance of inkjet printheads. It further illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical engineering usage.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["Vinh-TanNguyen", "Jason Yu ChuanLeong", "SatoshiWatanabe", "ToshimitsuMorooka", "TakayukiShimizu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12091038\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.10.010\n10.1088/1742-6596/105/1/012001\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/8/004\n10.3390/computation6040060\n10.1088/0960-1317/12/1/311\n10.1155/2014/270679\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.02.009\n10.1063/1.5088384\n10.3390/s18092881\n10.1039/C2LC20799K\n10.1039/c3lc50732g\n10.2514/1.19855\n10.2514/2.1936\n10.1002/nme.2579\n10.1115/1.2960953\n10.1177/1045389X06075658\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.05.030\n10.1016/j.matcom.2009.01.023\n10.1016/j.cpc.2009.09.018"}
{"title": "Bidirectional Active Piezoelectric Actuator Based on Optimized Bridge-Type Amplifier.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators based on bridge displacement amplifying mechanisms are widely used in precision driving and positioning fields. The classical bridge mechanism relies on structural flexibility to realize the return stroke, which leads to the low positioning accuracy of the actuator. In this paper, a series bridge mechanism is proposed to realize a bidirectional active drive; the return stroke is driven by a piezoelectric stack rather than by the flexibility of the structure. By analyzing the parameter sensitivity of the bridge mechanism, the series actuation of the bridge mechanism is optimized and the static and dynamic solutions are carried out by using the finite element method. Compared with the hysteresis loop of the piezoelectric stack, the displacement curve of the proposed actuator is symmetric, and the maximum nonlinear error is improved. The experimental results show that the maximum driving stroke of the actuator is 129.41 \u03bcm, and the maximum nonlinear error is 5.48%.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["WeiqingHuang", "JunkaiLian", "MingyangChen", "DaweiAn"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12091013\n10.1088/1361-665X/abc6b9\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037827\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111666\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.01.033\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112198\n10.1109/TMECH.2013.2262801\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.10.024\n10.3390/mi10120863\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.04.030\n10.3390/act9030047\n10.1063/1.1569411\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.05.015\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2017.11.002\n10.1007/s12213-020-00124-5\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2020.08.010\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.44-47.3828\n10.3390/s20154165\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.11.012\n10.3390/mi10030183\n10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.732\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2014.12.013\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.12.030\n10.1109/TRO.2012.2216392\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.05.027\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.09.010"}

Great interest in these materials is due to their properties associated with the transformation of electric polarization/magnetization under the influence of external magnetic/electric fields and the possibility of their use to create new devices. In the proposed review, ME magnetic field sensors based on the widely used structures Terfenol-PZT/PMN-PT, Metglas-PZT/PMN-PT, and Metglas-Lithium niobate, among others, are considered as the first applications of the ME effect in technology.

Taking into account the high sensitivity of ME magnetic field sensors, comparable to superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), we discuss the areas of their application.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-09-29", "authors": ["MirzaBichurin", "RomanPetrov", "OlegSokolov", "ViktorLeontiev", "ViktorKuts", "DmitryKiselev", "YaojinWang"], "doi": "10.3390/s21186232\n10.1063/1.2836410\n10.1016/j.mattod.2014.05.004\n10.1088/1361-6463/aac29b\n10.3390/act5010009\n10.1088/1361-6463/aac60b\n10.1557/mrs.2018.261\n10.3390/ma12142259\n10.1080/00150190214814\n10.1063/1.1611276\n10.1063/1.2007868\n10.1063/1.2969794\n10.1063/1.3176500\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2131647\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2274098\n10.1063/1.2172706\n10.1002/adma.201100773\n10.1063/1.4733963\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.09.004\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/6/065024\n10.1063/1.4891540\n10.1038/srep01985\n10.1063/1.4979694\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.09.047\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2309718\n10.1109/LSENS.2017.2752216\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.04.017\n10.3390/s21062022\n10.1063/5.0042448\n10.1063/1.1791732\n10.1063/1.2178582\n10.1002/pssr.200802020\n10.1063/1.2353819\n10.1063/1.4940382\n10.1109/TIM.2011.2122410\n10.1002/pssr.201105170\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04659.x\n10.1002/pssr.201206159\n10.1063/1.4737179\n10.1016/j.matlet.2012.06.100\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2270\n10.1109/ISOCC50952.2020.9332807\n10.1063/1.4994663\n10.3390/s20102810\n10.1063/5.0039089\n10.1063/1.3486483\n10.1063/1.5122774\n10.1002/adma.201606022\n10.1002/admt.201800484\n10.1063/1.5006203\n10.1063/1.3679661\n10.1088/1361-6463/aabda4\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2694342\n10.1143/JJAP.16.1069\n10.1134/S1063774516020115\n10.1080/00150190802427127\n10.1063/1.5038014\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.04.061\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.05.049\n10.1006/meth.2001.1238\n10.1016/j.matlet.2012.10.003\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.34.1022\n10.1063/1.4952735\n10.1038/s41598-017-18441-4\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.3014402\n10.1364/BOE.3.000981\n10.1109/TMAG.2014.2355414"}
{"title": "Error Analysis of the Combined-Scan High-Speed Atomic Force Microscopy.", "abstract": "A combined tip-sample scanning architecture can improve the imaging speed of atomic force microscopy (AFM). However, the nonorthogonality between the three scanners and the nonideal response of each scanner cause measurement errors. In this article, the authors systematically analyze the influence of the installation and response errors of the combined scanning architecture. The experimental results show that when the probe in the homemade high-speed AFM moves with the Z-scanner, the spot position on the four-quadrant detector changes, thus introducing measurement error. Comparing the experimental results with the numerical and theoretical results shows that the undesired motion of the Z-scanner introduces a large error. The authors believe that this significant error occurs because the piezoelectric actuator not only stretches along the polarization direction but also swings under nonuniform multifield coupling.

{"title": "Performance of a Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting System for an Energy-Autonomous Instrumented Total Hip Replacement: Experimental and Numerical Evaluation.", "abstract": "Instrumented implants can improve the clinical outcome of total hip replacements (THRs). To overcome the drawbacks of external energy supply and batteries, energy harvesting is a promising approach to power energy-autonomous implants. Therefore, we recently presented a new piezoelectric-based energy harvesting concept for THRs. In this study, the performance of the proposed energy harvesting system was numerically and experimentally investigated. First, we numerically reproduced our previous results for the physiologically based loading situation in a simplified setup. Thereafter, this configuration was experimentally realised by the implantation of a functional model of the energy harvesting concept into an artificial bone segment. Additionally, the piezoelectric element alone was investigated to analyse the predictive power of the numerical model. We measured the generated voltage for a load profile for walking and calculated the power output. The maximum power for the directly loaded piezoelectric element and the functional model were 28.6 and 10.2 \u00b5W, respectively. Numerically, 72.7 \u00b5W was calculated. The curve progressions were qualitatively in good accordance with the numerical data. The deviations were explained by sensitivity analysis and model simplifications, e.g., material data or lower acting force levels by malalignment and differences between virtual and experimental implantation.

In this article we show theoretically and experimentally how such a mode can be generated as the sum-frequency interaction of two high amplitude primary waves, and then serve as a local probe of material non-linearity. The solutions to the phase matching condition, i.e. condition for a constructive non-linear effect, are obtained numerically in the mark of classical, quadratic non-linearity. The coupling coefficients that measure the transfer rate of energy as a function of time from primary to secondary modes are derived. Experiments are conducted on an aluminum plate using piezo-electric transducers and a laser interferometer, and explore the interaction for incident symmetric and anti-symmetric fundamental Lamb modes. In an experiment operated without voltage amplifier we demonstrate that the resonant nature of these ZGV modes can be leveraged to accumulate energy from long excitations and produce detectable effects at extraordinarily low input power even in such weakly non-linear material.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["PierricMora", "MathieuChekroun", "SamuelRaetz", "VincentTournat"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106589"}

However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive and the majority of studies on animal models applying rather high-intensity ultrasound that cannot be safely used in humans. Here, we showed low-intensity ultrasound was able to activate neurons in the mouse brain and repeated ultrasound stimulation resulted in adult neurogenesis in specific brain regions. In vitro calcium imaging studies showed that a specific ultrasound stimulation mode, which combined with both ultrasound-induced pressure and acoustic streaming mechanotransduction, is required to activate cultured cortical neurons. ASIC1a and cytoskeletal proteins were involved in the low-intensity ultrasound-mediated mechanotransduction and cultured neuron activation, which was inhibited by ASIC1a blockade and cytoskeleton-modified agents. In contrast, the inhibition of mechanical-sensitive channels involved in bilayer-model mechanotransduction like Piezo or TRP proteins did not repress the ultrasound-mediated neuronal activation as efficiently. The ASIC1a-mediated ultrasound effects in mouse brain such as immediate response of ERK phosphorylation and DCX marked neurogenesis were statistically significantly compromised by ASIC1a gene deletion. Collated data suggest that ASIC1a is the molecular determinant involved in the mechano-signaling of low-intensity ultrasound that modulates neural activation in mouse brain.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["JormayLim", "Hsiao-HsinTai", "Wei-HaoLiao", "Ya-CherngChu", "Chen-MingHao", "Yueh-ChunHuang", "Cheng-HanLee", "Shao-ShienLin", "SherryHsu", "Ya-ChihChien", "Dar-MingLai", "Wen-ShiangChen", "Chih-ChengChen", "Jaw-LinWang"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.61660\n10.1021/bi200770q\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.01.005\n10.1016/j.mcn.2014.04.007\n10.1016/j.toxicon.2006.09.030\n10.1097/WNP.0000000000000488\n10.1111/jcmm.12025\n10.1186/s12929-018-0448-y\n10.1121/1.5111974\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2021.03.020\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1016/j.bcp.2019.03.004\n10.1227/NEU.0000000000000365\n10.1110/ps.0307003\n10.2174/1876386300902010011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074992\n10.1007/s10719-012-9386-1\n10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002440\n10.1042/BJ20070135\n10.1038/ncomms9264\n10.1073/pnas.1000154107\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5021-11.2012\n10.1038/srep27647\n10.1042/BJ20071614\n10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.040\n10.1038/nn.3620\n10.1111/cns.12524\n10.1115/1.4046883\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004293\n10.1111/ejn.12905\n10.1038/ncomms11460\n10.7554/eLife.38309\n10.1038/nrm.2017.92\n10.1016/j.trci.2019.06.007\n10.1016/j.tins.2012.04.002\n10.1038/ncomms4520\n10.1016/j.isci.2019.10.037\n10.1111/j.0953-816x.2003.03123.x\n10.1124/mol.111.072207\n10.3389/fnins.2016.00077\n10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.009\n10.7554/eLife.21074\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1665-11.2011\n10.1242/jcs.189316\n10.1038/nrn3529\n10.1371/journal.pone.0006508\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4132-12.2013"}

The application of an external stimulus such as mechanical strain or electric field has the potential to enhance bone formation and implant osseointegration. Therefore, in the present study, the objective is to investigate bone remodeling under electromechanical stimulation as a step towards establishing therapeutic strategies. For the first time, piezoelectric bone remodeling in the human proximal tibia under electro-mechanical loads was analyzed using the finite element method in an open-source framework. The predicted bone density distributions were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by comparing with the computed tomography (CT) scan and the bone mineral density (BMD) calculated from the CT, respectively. The effect of model parameters such as uniform initial bone density and reference stimulus on the final density distribution was investigated. Results of the parametric study showed that for different values of initial bone density the model predicted similar but not identical final density distribution. It was also shown that higher reference stimulus value yielded lower average bone density at the final time. The present study demonstrates an increase in bone density as a result of electrical stimulation. Thus, to minimize bone loss, for example, due to physical impairment or osteoporosis, mechanical loads during daily physical activities could be partially replaced by therapeutic electrical stimulation.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["Yogesh DeepakBansod", "MaeruanKebbach", "DanielKluess", "RainerBader", "Ursulavan Rienen"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2021.705199\n10.1016/B978-012387582-2/50038-1\n10.11588/ans.2015.100.20553\n10.1007/s10237-021-01439-3\n10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856543\n10.1126/science.137.3535.1063\n10.1038/204652a0\n10.1007/BF00042498\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1974.tb26781.x\n10.1186/1475-925X-10-58\n10.1007/BF02406129\n10.1016/S1672-6529(16)60432-8\n10.1201/b14263\n10.1016/0021-9290(95)00058-P\n10.1155/2018/2783867\n10.1016/S0021-9290(00)00237-2\n10.1186/1475-925X-12-130\n10.1017/S0956792512000150\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.09.032\n10.1016/j.cma.2010.01.005\n10.1016/0021-9290(94)00182-4\n10.1007/BF02648040\n10.1007/BF01313145\n10.3233/BIR-1968-5302\n10.1143/JPSJ.12.1158\n10.1143/jjap.3.117\n10.1007/s10237-005-0067-x\n10.1016/j.cma.2013.12.014\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.08.026\n10.1186/1742-4682-9-14\n10.1098/rsta.2008.0297\n10.1002/nme.2579\n10.1016/0021-9290(73)90039-0\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2016.04.036\n10.1016/S1672-6529(13)60230-9\n10.1007/978-3-319-13117-7_79\n10.1007/s10237-010-0222-x\n10.1016/0141-5425(88)90109-4\n10.1016/0021-9290(87)90030-3\n10.1016/0021-9290(80)90057-3\n10.1186/s40634-016-0072-2\n10.1016/S1672-6529(14)60039-1\n10.1007/978-3-642-23099-8\n10.1155/2017/8434281\n10.1038/228473a0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148603\n10.1515/cdbme-2016-0141\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/8/085706\n10.1016/j.bone.2019.07.024\n10.1016/0020-1383(94)90031-0\n10.1016/S0736-0266(03)00159-1\n10.1016/S0020-7225(01)00076-3\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2005.06.003\n10.1080/10255840903045029\n10.1002/jor.1100010105\n10.1016/0021-9290(84)90094-0\n10.14713/ejbe.v1i2.762\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.03.042\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2003.12.026\n10.1016/j.proeng.2011.04.031\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.03.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0184361\n10.3390/app9102160\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2008.06.001\n10.1109/COMPSAC.2007.185qx\n10.1615/CritRevEukarGeneExpr.v19.i4.50\n10.1177/09544119JEIM895\n10.1109/JBHI.2015.2423705\n10.1002/pamm.201510046\n10.1038/s41598-019-51429-w\n10.1080/10255842.2015.1131980\n10.1007/s10237-015-0669-x\n10.1016/0021-9290(92)90056-7\n10.1016/S0021-9290(00)00069-5\n10.1055/s-0028-1144106\n10.1097/00003086-197705000-00007\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.015\n10.1016/S0020-1383(13)70191-8\n10.3390/app11156677"}
{"title": "Acoustofluidic localization of sparse particles on a piezoelectric resonant sensor for nanogram-scale mass measurements.", "abstract": "The ability to weigh microsubstances present in low concentrations is an important tool for environmental monitoring and chemical analysis. For instance, developing a rapid analysis platform that identifies the material type of microplastics in seawater would help evaluate the potential toxicity to marine organisms. In this study, we demonstrate the integration of two different techniques that bring together the functions of sparse particle localization and miniaturized mass sensing on a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) chip for enhanced detection and minimization of negative measurements. The droplet sample for analysis is loaded onto the MEMS chip containing a resonant mass sensor. Through the coupling of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) from a SAW transducer into the chip, the initially dispersed microparticles in the droplet are localized over the detection area of the MEMS sensor, which is only 200\u2009\u00b5m wide. The accreted mass of the particles is then calibrated against the resulting shift in resonant frequency of the sensor. The SAW device and MEMS chip are detachable after use, allowing the reuse of the SAW device part of the setup instead of the disposal of both parts. Our platform maintains the strengths of noncontact and label-free dual-chip acoustofluidic devices, demonstrating for the first time an integrated microparticle manipulation and real-time mass measurement platform useful for the analysis of sparse microsubstances.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["JinguiQian", "HabibaBegum", "Joshua E-YLee"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-021-00288-5\n10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00220-5\n10.1016/j.envint.2017.02.013\n10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.05.030\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2875054\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2915292\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2872923\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2955402\n10.1109/TED.2018.2810700\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2884247\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01496\n10.1039/D0LC00378F\n10.1038/s41592-018-0222-9\n10.1126/sciadv.aau6062\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03314\n10.1039/D0LC00106F\n10.1039/C5LC01104C\n10.1002/anie.201310401\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112432\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00605\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02850\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01757\n10.1126/sciadv.abc0467\n10.1039/C0LC00234H\n10.1063/1.3049128\n10.1039/D1AN00197C\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00213\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03314"}
{"title": "Recent progress in silk fibroin-based flexible electronics.", "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the emergence of 5G, traditional silicon-based electronics no longer fully meet market demands such as nonplanar application scenarios due to mechanical mismatch. This provides unprecedented opportunities for flexible electronics that bypass the physical rigidity through the introduction of flexible materials. In recent decades, biological materials with outstanding biocompatibility and biodegradability, which are considered some of the most promising candidates for next-generation flexible electronics, have received increasing attention, e.g., silk fibroin, cellulose, pectin, chitosan, and melanin. Among them, silk fibroin presents greater superiorities in biocompatibility and biodegradability, and moreover, it also possesses a variety of attractive properties, such as adjustable water solubility, remarkable optical transmittance, high mechanical robustness, light weight, and ease of processing, which are partially or even completely lacking in other biological materials. Therefore, silk fibroin has been widely used as fundamental components for the construction of biocompatible flexible electronics, particularly for wearable and implantable devices. Furthermore, in recent years, more attention has been paid to the investigation of the functional characteristics of silk fibroin, such as the dielectric properties, piezoelectric properties, strong ability to lose electrons, and sensitivity to environmental variables. Here, this paper not only reviews the preparation technologies for various forms of silk fibroin and the recent progress in the use of silk fibroin as a fundamental material but also focuses on the recent advanced works in which silk fibroin serves as functional components. Additionally, the challenges and future development of silk fibroin-based flexible electronics are summarized. (1) This review focuses on silk fibroin serving as active functional components to construct flexible electronics. (2) Recent representative reports on flexible electronic devices that applied silk fibroin as fundamental supporting components are summarized. (3) This review summarizes the current typical silk fibroin-based materials and the corresponding advanced preparation technologies.

{"title": "Avoiding transduction-induced heating in suspended microchannel resonators using piezoelectricity.", "abstract": "Calorimetry of single biological entities remains elusive. Suspended microchannel resonators (SMRs) offer excellent performance for real-time detection of various analytes and could hold the key to unlocking pico-calorimetry experiments. However, the typical readout techniques for SMRs are optical-based, and significant heat is dissipated in the sensor, altering the measurement and worsening the frequency noise. In this manuscript, we demonstrate for the first time full on-chip piezoelectric transduction of SMRs on which we focus a laser Doppler vibrometer to analyze its effect. We demonstrate that suddenly applying the laser to a water-filled SMR causes a resonance frequency shift, which we attribute to a local increase in temperature. When the procedure is repeated at increasing flow rates, the resonance frequency shift diminishes, indicating that convection plays an important role in cooling down the device and dissipating the heat induced by the laser. We also show that the frequency stability of the device is degraded by the laser source. In comparison to an optical readout scheme, a low-dissipative transduction method such as piezoelectricity shows greater potential to capture the thermal properties of single entities.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["DamienMaillard", "AnnalisaDe Pastina", "Amir MusaAbazari", "Luis GuillermoVillanueva"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-021-00254-1\n10.1038/nbt0901-856\n10.1038/nnano.2008.275\n10.1039/C2CS35293A\n10.1038/nnano.2011.44\n10.1063/1.368002\n10.1063/1.1611625\n10.1038/nature05741\n10.1073/pnas.1318602111\n10.3390/s150407650\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2689162\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.04.095\n10.1038/nbt.3666\n10.1038/srep18542\n10.1002/biot.201400494\n10.1039/C8LC00238J\n10.1039/C6LC00949B\n10.1073/pnas.1804174115\n10.1126/science.1195475\n10.1016/j.mee.2018.02.011\n10.1021/nn200623c\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa591e\n10.1039/C0LC00447B\n10.1038/srep33799\n10.1088/1361-6439/ab6df1\n10.1063/1.5088946\n10.1063/1.1896103\n10.1038/nature02905\n10.1063/1.1507833\n10.1038/nnano.2008.125\n10.1038/srep16393\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.177208"}
{"title": "Optical actuation of a micromechanical photodiode via the photovoltaic-piezoelectric effect.", "abstract": "Radiation pressure and photothermal forces have been previously used to optically actuate micro/nanomechanical structures fabricated from semiconductor piezoelectric materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs). In these materials, coupling of the photovoltaic and piezoelectric properties has not been fully explored and leads to a new type of optical actuation that we call the photovoltaic-piezoelectric effect (PVPZ). We demonstrate this effect by electrically measuring, via the direct piezoelectric effect, the optically induced strain in a novel torsional resonator. The micron-scale torsional resonator is fabricated from a lattice-matched single-crystal molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown GaAs photodiode heterostructure. We find that the strain depends on the product of the electro-optic responsivity and piezoelectric constant of GaAs. The photovoltaic-piezoelectric effect has important potential applications, such as in the development of configurable optical circuits, which can be used in neuromorphic photonic chips, processing of big data with deep learning and the development of quantum circuits.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["ARampal", "R NKleiman"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-021-00249-y\n10.1038/s41586-019-1051-4\n10.1063/1.5143484\n10.1038/nphys2196\n10.1016/j.physe.2009.12.038\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.263903\n10.1364/OPTICA.6.000577\n10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2831001\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.203902\n10.1109/JSTQE.2004.828474\n10.1016/0039-6028(74)90175-7\n10.1038/s41467-020-14910-z\n10.1063/1.5075525\n10.1038/nature03118\n10.1038/s41586-019-1320-2\n10.1038/s41598-017-16063-4\n10.1063/1.4905505\n10.1038/425145a\n10.1038/nature05669\n10.1038/nmat2807\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.153601\n10.1002/pssb.19610010403\n10.1016/0032-3861(80)90083-X\n10.1080/00150198308014428\n10.1109/JMEMS.2019.2899266\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111940\n10.1038/s41598-018-22219-7\n10.1109/TED.2020.3019230\n10.1063/1.5131657\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/21/215502\n10.1063/1.4765702\n10.7567/1347-4065/ab3617\n10.1038/nenergy.2017.144\n10.1038/s41560-019-0434-y\n10.1016/j.solmat.2009.03.027\n10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2020.125668\n10.1126/science.1144793\n10.1088/0960-1317/4/1/004\n10.1038/nature01773\n10.1038/nphys2665\n10.1109/PROC.1969.6912\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/6/065019\n10.1063/1.1138425\n10.1088/0960-1317/3/1/006\n10.1098/rspa.1954.0043\n10.1098/rspa.1978.0072\n10.1126/science.aay8645\n10.1038/s41598-017-07754-z\n10.1038/nphoton.2017.93\n10.1126/science.aar7053\n10.1038/s41566-020-0609-x\n10.1038/nature08967\n10.1038/nature10461\n10.1038/nature10261\n10.1063/1.4955408\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.13.014027"}

{"title": "Preparation and Characterization of MWCNTs/PVDF Conductive Membrane with Cross-Linked Polymer PVA and Study on Its Anti-Fouling Performance.", "abstract": "Based on carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH), a MWCNTs/PVDF conductive membrane was prepared by a vacuum filtration cross-linking method. The surface compositions and morphology of conductive membranes were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The effects of cross-linked polymeric polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on the conductive membrane properties such as the porosity, pore size distribution, pure water flux, conductivity, hydrophilicity, stability and antifouling properties were investigated. Results showed that the addition of PVA to the MWCNTs/PVDF conductive membrane decreased the pure water flux, porosity and the conductivity. However, the hydrophilicity of the modified MWCNTs/PVDF conductive membrane was greatly improved, and the contact angle of pure water was reduced from 70.18\u00b0 to 25.48\u00b0 with the addition of PVA contents from 0 wt% to 0.05 wt%. Meanwhile, the conductive membranes with higher content had a relatively higher stability. It was found that the conductive functional layer of the conductive membrane had an average mass loss rate of 1.22% in the 30 min ultrasonic oscillation experiment. The tensile intensity and break elongation ratio of the conductive membrane are improved by the addition of PVA, and the durability of the conductive membrane with PVA was superior to that without PVA added. The electric assisted anti-fouling experiments of modified conductive membrane indicated that compared with the condition without electric field, the average flux attenuation of the conductive membrane was reduced by 11.2%, and the membrane flux recovery rate reached 97.05%. Moreover, the addition of PVA could accelerate the clean of the conductive membranes.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2021-09-27", "authors": ["YiDing", "ZhanshengGuo", "XinanDong", "HongYou", "JunxueMei", "XuguangHou", "ZhenlinLiang", "ZhipengLi"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes11090703\n10.3390/membranes10110353\n10.3390/w12123410\n10.1039/C5EW00159E\n10.1080/19443994.2014.884681\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2018.01.015\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.07.033\n10.1038/s41545-020-00090-2\n10.1016/j.biortech.2012.04.089\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.09.042\n10.1016/j.biortech.2014.02.111\n10.1016/j.wri.2019.100111\n10.1016/j.jece.2019.103447\n10.1002/app.47914\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.127042\n10.1016/j.biortech.2018.08.087\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.01.188\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.11.066\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130794\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.048\n10.1007/s00289-021-03564-6\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134050\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.12.106\n10.1021/es5039479\n10.1007/s13204-018-0826-5\n10.1016/j.desal.2015.01.006\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.001\n10.1002/adma.200801919\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.01.025\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.061\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.07.023\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.05.041\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.06.089\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.09.019\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2012.05.013\n10.1080/14686996.2016.1214526\n10.1007/s10853-019-04161-9\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.12.058\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.06.016\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.11.072\n10.1016/j.mseb.2021.115095\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.09.040"}

{"title": "Electrochemical Biosensors for Tracing Cyanotoxins in Food and Environmental Matrices.", "abstract": "The adoption of electrochemical principles to realize on-field analytical tools for detecting pollutants represents a great possibility for food safety and environmental applications. With respect to the existing transduction mechanisms, i.e., colorimetric, fluorescence, piezoelectric etc., electrochemical mechanisms offer the tremendous advantage of being easily miniaturized, connected with low cost (commercially available) readers and unaffected by the color/turbidity of real matrices. In particular, their versatility represents a powerful approach for detecting traces of emerging pollutants such as cyanotoxins. The combination of electrochemical platforms with nanomaterials, synthetic receptors and microfabrication makes electroanalysis a strong starting point towards decentralized monitoring of toxins in diverse matrices. This review gives an overview of the electrochemical biosensors that have been developed to detect four common cyanotoxins, namely microcystin-LR, anatoxin-a, saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin.

{"title": "The nematode C.\u00a0elegans senses airborne sound.", "abstract": "Unlike olfaction, taste, touch, vision, and proprioception, which are widespread across animal phyla, hearing is found only in vertebrates and some arthropods. The vast majority of invertebrate species are thus considered insensitive to sound. Here, we challenge this conventional view by showing that the earless nematode C.\u00a0elegans senses airborne sound at frequencies reaching the kHz range. Sound vibrates C.\u00a0elegans skin, which acts as a pressure-to-displacement transducer similar to vertebrate eardrum, activates sound-sensitive FLP/PVD neurons attached to the skin, and evokes phonotaxis behavior. We identified two nAChRs that transduce sound signals independently of ACh, revealing an unexpected function of nAChRs in mechanosensation. Thus, the ability to sense airborne sound is not restricted to vertebrates and arthropods as previously thought, and might have evolved multiple times independently in the animal kingdom, suggesting convergent evolution. Our studies also demonstrate that animals without ears may not be presumed to be sound insensitive.", "journal": "Neuron", "date": "2021-09-24", "authors": ["Adam JIliff", "CanWang", "Elizabeth ARonan", "Alison EHake", "YulingGuo", "XiaLi", "XinxingZhang", "MaohuaZheng", "JianfengLiu", "KarlGrosh", "R KeithDuncan", "X Z ShawnXu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2021.08.035"}
{"title": "Strong tribo-piezoelectric effect in bilayer indium nitride (InN).", "abstract": "The high electronegativity between the atoms of two-dimensional (2D) group-III nitrides makes them attractive to demonstrating a strong out-of-plane piezo-electricity effect. Energy harvesting devices can be predicted by cultivating such salient piezoelectric features. This work explores the tribo-piezoelectric properties of 2D-indium nitride (InN) as a promising candidate in nanogenerator applications by means of first-principles calculations. In-plane interlayer sliding between two InN monolayers leads to a noticeable rise of vertical piezoelectricity. The vertical resistance between the InN bilayer renders tribological energy by the sliding effect. During the vertical sliding, a shear strength of 6.6-9.7 GPa is observed between the monolayers. The structure can be used as a tribo-piezoelectric transducer to extract force and stress from the generated out-of-plane tribo-piezoelectric energy. The A-A stacking of the bilayer InN elucidates the highest out-of-plane piezoelectricity. Any decrease in the interlayer distance between the monolayers improves the out-of-plane polarization and thus, increases the inductive voltage generation. Vertical compression of bilayer InN produces an inductive voltage in the range of 0.146-0.196\u00a0V. Utilizing such a phenomenon, an InN-based bilayer compression-sliding nanogenerator is proposed, which can tune the generated tribo-piezoelectric energy by compressing the interlayer distance between the InN monolayers.

However, studies on the effects of additive and coagulation bath pH on the morphology and properties of surfactant-modified membranes have rarely been reported. Hence, this study aims to investigate the effects of the additive dosage and the coagulation bath pH on the mechanisms of phase inversion and performance improvement of amphoteric fluorocarbon special surfactant (FS-50) blended PVDF membranes. It was observed that the pure water flux increased from 114.68 LMH/bar of the original membrane M0 to 205.02 LMH/bar of the blend membrane M1, and then to 615.88 LMH/bar of the coagulation-bath-regulated membrane MPH9 with a high BSA rejection rate of 90.86%, showing a two-stage jump. The addition of FS-50 promoted the instantaneous phase inversion of the membrane, allowing the blend membrane to exhibit a higher proportion of pore characteristics and stronger permeability. After that, the mechanisms of the membrane phase inversion process affected by the coagulation bath pH were interpreted according to the pH-response characteristics of FS-50 in terms of charge repulsion effect and compressed double-electron layer effect. Furthermore, the cross-sectional morphology and the surface structure of the membrane prepared in acidic and alkaline coagulation baths were significantly affected by the pH of the coagulation bath, exhibiting different features. For one, the porosity of the membranes gradually decreased as the acidity and alkalinity of the coagulation bath increased, and the membrane MPH9 exhibited both maximum surface and overall porosity. For another, the coagulation bath pH did not negatively affect the contact angle, surface roughness and tensile strength of the membranes. Overall, adjusting the dosage of FS-50 and the pH of the coagulation bath is a promising approach to greatly enhance membrane performance.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2021-09-22", "authors": ["HailongLiu", "XiangjunLiao", "YuxiaRen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132212"}

However, the alkaline stability conjugated to the low conductivity of hydroxide ions of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) still represents a major drawback for the large deployment of such technology. In this study, three types of tetraarylpolyphosphonium (pTAP)-based copolymers (namely, CP1, CP2, and CP3) are synthesized and blended with chitosan and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) for the fabrication of AEMs. Chitosan, a green biopolymer, was employed as a blend to enhance the water uptake of the base ionomer matrix.

However, constructing a superhydrophobic interface often has to undergo complex modification procedures including roughness construction and hydrophobic modification. Herein, all-polymer and self-roughened superhydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) fibrous membranes (PVDF FMs) with robustly stable pores were successfully constructed via electrospinning of fluorinated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes/PVDF (F-POSS/PVDF) emulsion solution in combination with hot-pressing. The comparative experiment reveals that proper hot-pressing, including adequate temperature and pressure, can help improve membrane pore stability by welding the intersecting fibers and increase the membrane surface hydrophobicity by transferring the inner fluorine chains to the outer fiber surface, simultaneously advancing membrane scaling and fouling resistance. Nevertheless, excessive temperature or pressure will destroy the interconnected pores and surface wettability of the PVDF FM.

In this study, we report the piezo-conductive sensors by a semiconducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with tosylate ions (PEDOT:Tos) thin films. Systemically studies indicate that the piezo-conductive response of the PEDOT:Tos thin films is originated from the deformation of the PEDOT crystal cells and the stretched \u03c0-\u03c0 distances induced by Tos. Moreover, the negative piezo-conductive effect, for the first time, is observed from PEDOT:Tos thin film under the pressure. A working mechanism is further proposed to interpret the transient from a positive to a negative piezo-conductive response within the PEDOT:Tos thin films. Our studies offer a facile route to approach effective piezo-conductive sensors based on conjugated polymers.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-09-16", "authors": ["ChaoYi", "LeningShen", "JieZheng", "XiongGong"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-97812-4\n10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013612\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.015\n10.1016/0924-4247(91)85017-I\n10.1103/PhysRev.94.42\n10.1016/0001-6160(57)90164-5\n10.1021/nl802556d\n10.1002/adma.200602705\n10.1021/cr900244n\n10.1039/C2TC00114D\n10.3390/s150100818\n10.1021/acsami.5b04892\n10.1021/cm061032+\n10.1038/nmat3012\n10.1039/C6TA04122A\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-4095(200004)12:7<481::AID-ADMA481>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1039/b417803n\n10.1039/C5TC01952D\n10.1002/aenm.201400378\n10.1007/s10965-011-9815-z\n10.1109/LED.2009.2031255\n10.1039/C4TA03645J"}
{"title": "Understanding the Origin of Enhanced Piezoelectric Response in PVDF Matrices with Embedded ZnO Nanoparticles, from Polarizable Molecular Dynamics Simulations.", "abstract": "The pervasive use of portable electronic devices, powered from rechargeable batteries, represents a significant portion of the electricity consumption in the world. A sustainable and alternative energy source for these devices would require unconventional power sources, such as harvesting kinetic/potential energy from mechanical vibrations, ultrasound waves, and biomechanical motion, to name a few. Piezoelectric materials transform mechanical deformation into electric fields or, conversely, external electric fields into mechanical motion. Therefore, accurate prediction of elastic and piezoelectric properties of materials, from the atomic structure and composition, is essential for studying and optimizing new piezogenerators. Here, we demonstrate the application of harmonic-covalent and reactive force fields (FF), Dreiding and ReaxFF, respectively, coupled to the polarizable charge equilibration (PQEq) model for predicting the elastic moduli and piezoelectric response of crystalline zinc oxide (ZnO) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). Furthermore, we parametrized the ReaxFF atomic interactions for Zn-F in order to characterize the interfacial effects in hybrid PVDF matrices with embedded ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). We capture the nonlinear piezoelectric behavior of the PVDF-ZnO system at different ZnO concentrations and the enhanced response that was recently observed experimentally, between 5 and 7 wt % ZnO concentrations. From our simulation results, we demonstrate that the origin of this enhancement is due to an increase in the total atomic stress distribution at the interface between the two materials. This result provides valuable insight into the design of new and improved piezoelectric nanogenerators and demonstrates the practical value of these first-principles based modeling methods in materials science.", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "date": "2021-09-15", "authors": ["Juan MMarmolejo-Tejada", "JhonattanDe La Roche-Yepes", "Carlos AP\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez", "Jaime A P\u00e9rezTaborda", "Alba\u00c1vila", "AndresJaramillo-Botero"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00822"}

{"title": "Periodic Tubular Structures and Phononic Crystals towards High-Q Liquid Ultrasonic Inline Sensors for Pipes.", "abstract": "The article focuses on a high-resolution ultrasound sensor for real-time monitoring of liquid analytes in cylindrical pipes, tubes, or capillaries. The development of such a sensor faces the challenges of acoustic energy losses, including dissipation at liquid/solid interface and acoustic wave radiation along the pipe. Furthermore, we consider acoustic resonant mode coupling and mode conversion. We show how the concept of phononic crystals can be applied to solve these problems and achieve the maximum theoretically possible Q-factor for resonant ultrasonic sensors. We propose an approach for excitation and measurement of an isolated radial resonant mode with minimal internal losses. The acoustic energy is effectively localized in a narrow probing area due to the introduction of periodically arranged sectioned rings around the tube.

{"title": "Langasite as Piezoelectric Substrate for Sensors in Harsh Environments: Investigation of Surface Degradation under High-Temperature Air Atmosphere.", "abstract": "Langasite crystals (LGS) are known for their exceptional piezoelectric properties at high temperatures up to 1000 \u00b0C and more. In this respect, many studies have been conducted in order to achieve surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors based on LGS crystals dedicated to high-temperature operations. Operating temperatures of more than 1000 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C for wired and wireless sensors, respectively, have been reached. These outstanding performances have been obtained under an air atmosphere since LGS crystals are not stable in high-temperature conditions under a low-oxygen atmosphere due to their oxide nature. However, if the stability of bulk LGS crystals under a high-temperature air atmosphere is well established, the surface deterioration under such conditions has been hardly investigated, as most of the papers dedicated to LGS-based SAW sensors are essentially focused on the development of thin film electrodes that are able to withstand very elevated temperatures to be combined with LGS crystals. Yet, any surface modification of the substrate can dramatically change the performance of SAW sensors. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to study the stability of the LGS surface under a high-temperature air environment. To do so, LGS substrates have been annealed in an air atmosphere at temperatures between 800 and 1200 \u00b0C and for durations between one week and one month. The morphology, microstructure, and chemical composition of the LGS surface was examined before and after annealing treatments by numerous and complementary methods, while the surface acoustic properties have been probed by SAW measurements. These investigations reveal that depending on both the temperature and the annealing duration, many defects with a corolla-like shape appear at the surface of LGS crystals in high-temperature prolonged exposure in an air atmosphere. These defects are related to the formation of a new phase, likely an oxiapatite ternary compound, the chemical formula of which is La", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-09-11", "authors": ["ThierryAubert", "NinelKokanyan", "OmarElmazria"], "doi": "10.3390/s21175978\n10.1016/0022-0248(74)90099-2\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2943310\n10.1109/LSENS.2019.2908691\n10.1007/s10832-006-9735-1\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2178\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1367482\n10.1016/j.proeng.2012.09.374\n10.3390/ma13071605\n10.3390/mi12060643\n10.1088/1757-899X/18/9/092020\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2880820\n10.3390/s20092441\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.3032477\n10.1063/5.0036554\n10.5194/jsss-9-15-2020\n10.1109/TMTT.2018.2854160\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1367476\n10.1002/pssa.200925605\n10.1016/S0022-0248(02)02489-2\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.03.008\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1843"}

{"title": "PEA Electromagnetic Distortion Reduction by Impedance Grounding and Pulsed Voltage Electrode Configurations.", "abstract": "Space charges are one of the main challenges facing the constantly increasing use of extruded high voltage direct current (HVDC) cables. The Pulsed Electro-Acoustic (PEA) method is one of the most common procedures for space charge measurements of insulation. One issue with the PEA method is distortion due to the crosstalk between the applied voltage pulse and the acoustic sensor. This work analyzed two factors involved in the reduction in this distortion: the influence of the exposed semiconductor distance between the injection electrodes and PEA test cell, and the influence of adding a reactance at the grounding circuit of the PEA test cell. The interaction of these two factors with the distortion was analyzed through a series of experimental testing. Moreover, the performance regarding distortion after applying a developed coaxial injection was compared with the standard non-coaxial injection configuration. It was observed that these two factors had a direct impact on distortion and can be utilized for the reduction in distortion arising from the crosstalk of the applied pulsed voltage. The results can be utilized for the consideration of practical aspects during the construction of a PEA test setup for the measurement of full-size HVDC cables.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-09-11", "authors": ["GuillermoMier Escurra", "ArmandoRodrigo Mor", "Luis CarlosCastro", "PeterVaessen"], "doi": "10.3390/s21175837\n10.1109/MEI.2018.8507715\n10.1109/94.625644\n10.1109/94.556559\n10.1109/94.625642\n10.1109/CEIDP.1997.634565\n10.1007/BF02900426\n10.1109/TDEI.2005.1522183\n10.1109/94.971452\n10.1109/94.971453\n10.1109/TDEI.2014.004467\n10.1109/TDEI.2017.006196\n10.1109/TDEI.2019.008160\n10.1109/TDEI.2019.008602\n10.1109/TDEI.2003.1219652\n10.1109/TDEI.2016.7736878\n10.1109/57.954575\n10.18494/SAM.2017.1506\n10.1109/61.660842\n10.1109/61.660837\n10.1109/ceidp.1999.804581\n10.1109/TDEI.2014.004557\n10.1109/TDEI.2008.4543123\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990759\n10.3390/s20113087\n10.3390/en12214186\n10.1109/94.300251\n10.1109/TDEI.2012.6259992\n10.1109/MEI.2018.8430040"}
{"title": "Tunable Optical Diffusers Based on the UV/Ozone-Assisted Self-Wrinkling of Thermal-Cured Polymer Films.", "abstract": "Tunable optical diffusers have attracted attention because of the rapid development of next generation stretchable optoelectronics and optomechanics applications. Flexible wrinkle structures have the potential to change the light path and tune the diffusion capability, which is beneficial to fabricate optical diffusers. The generation of wrinkles usually depends on an external stimulus, thus resulting in complicated fabricating equipment and processes. In this study, a facile and low-cost method is proposed to fabricate wrinkle structures by the self-wrinkling of thermal-cured polymer for tunable optical diffusers. The uncured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) precursors were exposed to UV/ozone to obtain hard silica layers and then crosslinked via heating to induce the wrinkle patterns. The wrinkle structures were demonstrated as strain-dependent tunable optical diffusers and the optical diffusion of transmitted light via the deformable wrinkle structures was studied and adjusted. The incident light isotropically diffused through the sample at the initial state. When the wrinkle structures deformed, it showed a more pronounced isotropic optical diffusion with uniaxial tensile strain. The optical diffusion is anisotropical with a further increase in uniaxial tensile strain. The proposed method of fabricating wrinkles by UV/ozone-assisted self-wrinkling of thermal-cured polymer films is simple and cost-effective, and the obtained structures have potential applications in tunable optical diffusers.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-09-11", "authors": ["ShulanJiang", "YongTan", "YongPeng", "JiangZhao"], "doi": "10.3390/s21175820\n10.1038/s41377-020-0331-y\n10.1021/nn500155e\n10.1039/C8NR00529J\n10.1021/jp902598f\n10.1016/j.powtec.2008.12.003\n10.1038/s41560-017-0001-3\n10.1002/adma.201706589\n10.1021/acsnano.8b00829\n10.1002/adma.201002320\n10.1021/am5037687\n10.1002/adom.201300128\n10.1002/adom.201600122\n10.1021/acsnano.7b07082\n10.1080/02678292.2018.1477210\n10.1021/acscentsci.9b00155\n10.1021/acsami.7b08333\n10.3390/s16122131\n10.1039/c3sm52766b\n10.1038/srep12356\n10.1002/adfm.201808979\n10.1002/adma.201101366\n10.3390/s21082787\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.11.014\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2011.12.063\n10.1007/s00542-007-0417-y\n10.1039/C8SM01054D\n10.1021/la901736n\n10.1038/srep16527\n10.1039/C5SM00318K"}

In this study, we designed, fabricated, and experimented with an active reflection controller that can reduce acoustic signals according to the angle of incidence. The controller consists of a transmitter on one layer, a receiver sensor on two layers, and an acoustic window on three layers.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Microvibration Mitigates Estrogen Loss-Induced Osteoporosis and Promotes Piezo1, MicroRNA-29a, and Wnt3a Signaling in Osteoblasts.", "abstract": "Biophysical stimulation alters bone-forming cell activity, bone formation and remodeling. The effect of piezoelectric microvibration stimulation (PMVS) intervention on osteoporosis development remains uncertain. We investigated whether 60 Hz, 120 Hz, and 180 Hz PMVS (0.05 g, 20 min/stimulation, 3 stimulations/week for 4 consecutive weeks) intervention affected bone integrity in ovariectomized (OVX) mice or osteoblastic activity. PMVS (120 Hz)-treated OVX mice developed fewer osteoporosis conditions, including bone mineral density loss and trabecular microstructure deterioration together with decreased serum resorption marker CTX-1 levels, as compared to control OVX animals. The biomechanical strength of skeletal tissue was improved upon 120 Hz PMVS intervention. This intervention compromised OVX-induced sparse trabecular bone morphology, osteoblast loss, osteoclast overburden, and osteoclast-promoting cytokine RANKL immunostaining and reversed osteoclast inhibitor OPG immunoreactivity. Osteoblasts in OVX mice upon PMVS intervention showed strong Wnt3a immunoreaction and weak Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 immunostaining. In vitro, PMVS reversed OVX-induced loss in von Kossa-stained mineralized nodule formation, Runx2, and osteocalcin expression in primary bone-marrow stromal cells.

{"title": "Evaluation of Clustering Techniques to Predict Surface Roughness during Turning of Stainless-Steel Using Vibration Signals.", "abstract": "In metal-cutting processes, the interaction between the tool and workpiece is highly nonlinear and is very sensitive to small variations in the process parameters. This causes difficulties in controlling and predicting the resulting surface finish quality of the machined surface. In this work, vibration signals along the major cutting force direction in the turning process are measured at different combinations of cutting speeds, feeds, and depths of cut using a piezoelectric accelerometer. The signals are processed to extract features in the time and frequency domains. These include statistical quantities, Fast Fourier spectral signatures, and various wavelet analysis extracts. Various feature selection methods are applied to the extracted features for dimensionality reduction, followed by applying several outlier-resistant unsupervised clustering algorithms on the reduced feature set. The objective is to ascertain if partitions created by the clustering algorithms correspond to experimentally obtained surface roughness data for specific combinations of cutting conditions. We find 75% accuracy in predicting surface finish from the Noise Clustering Fuzzy C-Means (NC-FCM) and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms, and upwards of 80% accuracy in identifying outliers. In general, wrapper methods used for feature selection had better partitioning efficacy than filter methods for feature selection.

It is shown that a polarization difference exists between WZ nitride compounds, while for H and ZB lattices the results are consistent with zero polarization difference. It is therefore proven that the difference in Berry phase spontaneous polarization for bulk nitrides (AlN, GaN and InN) obtained by Bernardini et al. and Dreyer et al. was not caused by the different reference phase. These models provided absolute values of the polarization that differed by more than one order of magnitude for the same material, but they provided similar polarization differences between binary compounds, which agree also with our ab initio calculations. In multi-quantum wells (MQWs), the electric fields are generated by the well-barrier polarization difference; hence, the calculated electric fields are similar for the three models, both for GaN/AlN and InN/GaN structures. Including piezoelectric effect, which can account for 50% of the total polarization difference, these theoretical data are in satisfactory agreement with photoluminescence measurements in GaN/AlN MQWs.

Though many biomolecular crystals contain polar molecules, they are frequently centrosymmetric, signifying that the dipole moments of constituent molecules cancel each other. However, piezoelectricity can be induced by stereospecific doping leading to symmetry reduction. Here, we applied piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), highly sensitive to local piezoelectricity, to characterize (01\u00af0) faces of a popular biomolecular material, \u03b1-glycine, doped with other amino acids such as L-alanine and L-threonine as well as co-doped with both. We show that, while apparent vertical piezoresponse is prone to parasitic electrostatic effects, shear piezoelectric activity is strongly affected by doping. Undoped \u03b1-glycine shows no shear piezoelectric response at all. The shear response of the L-alanine doped crystals is much larger than those of the L-threonine doped crystals and co-doped crystals.

{"title": "Sustainability of Civil Structures through the Application of Smart Materials: A Review.", "abstract": "Every year, structural flaws or breakdowns cause thousands of people to be harmed and cost billions of dollars owing to the limitations of design methods and materials to withstand extreme earthquakes. Since earthquakes have a significant effect on sustainability factors, there is a contradiction between these constraints and the growing need for more sustainable structures. There has been a significant attempt to circumvent these constraints by developing various techniques and materials. One of these viable possibilities is the application of smart structures and materials such as shape memory and piezoelectric materials. Many scholars have examined the use of these materials and their structural characteristics up to this point, but the relationship between sustainability considerations and the deployment of smart materials has received little attention. Therefore, through a review of previous experimental, numerical, and conceptual studies, this paper attempts to draw a more significant relationship between smart materials and structural sustainability. First, the significant impact of seismic events on structural sustainability and its major aspects are described.

In this work, a rational design of deacetylated cellulose acetate/polyvinylidene fluoride (dCA/PVDF) Janus nanofibrous membrane, with asymmetric wettability in either air, water or diesel environment, was developed via sequential electrospinning PVDF and CA membranes followed by alkali treatment. In the process of water-in-diesel emulsion separation, the under-diesel superhydrophilic dCA layer is able to capture the emulsified water and strengthens the demulsification ability of the Janus membrane, while the under-diesel superhydrophobic PVDF layer acts as a water barrier and further improves the separation ability. The Janus membrane therefore exhibited prominent separation performance not only for the water/diesel mixture (separation efficiency 99.98%) but also for the surfactant-stabilized water-in-diesel emulsion with l vol% water (separation efficiency 97.74%). Moreover, the Janus membrane maintained high separation efficiency over 96% after repeated use for 50 times or soaking in corrosive solutions for 24\u00a0h.

{"title": "Temperature- and Defect-Induced Uniaxial Tensile Mechanical Behaviors and the Fracture Mechanism of Two-Dimensional Silicon Germanide.", "abstract": "Recently, monolayer silicon germanide (SiGe), a newly explored buckled honeycomb configuration of silicon and germanium, is predicted to be a promising nanomaterial for next-generation nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) due to its intriguing electronic, optical, and piezoelectric properties. In the NEMS applications, the structure is subjected to uniaxial tensile mechanical loading, and the investigation of the mechanical behaviors is of fundamental importance to ensure structural stability. Here, we systematically explored the uniaxial tensile mechanical properties of 2D-SiGe through molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of temperature ranges from 300 to 1000 K and vacancy defects, for instance, point and bi vacancy, for both armchair and zigzag orientations of 2D-SiGe were investigated. In addition, the influence of system areas and strain rates on the stress-strain performance of 2D-SiGe has also been studied. With the increase in temperature and vacancy concentration, the mechanical properties of 2D-SiGe show decreasing behavior for both orientations and the armchair chirality shows superior mechanical strength to the zigzag direction due to its bonding characteristics. A phase transformation-induced second linearly elastic region was observed at large deformation strain, leading to an anomalous stress-strain behavior in the zigzag direction. At 300 K temperature, we obtained a fracture stress of \u223c94.83 GPa and an elastic modulus of \u223c388.7 GPa along the armchair direction, which are about \u223c3.17 and \u223c2.83% higher than the zigzag-oriented fracture strength and elastic modulus. Moreover, because of the strong regularity interruption effect, the point vacancy shows the largest decrease in fracture strength, elastic modulus, and fracture strain compared to the bi vacancy defects for both armchair and zigzag orientations. Area and strain rate investigations reveal that 2D-SiGe is less susceptible to the system area and strain rate. These findings provide a deep insight into controlling the tensile mechanical behavior of 2D-SiGe for its applications in next-generation NEMS and nanodevices.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2021-09-10", "authors": ["A S M JannatulIslam", "Md ShahadatAkbar", "Md SherajulIslam", "JeongwonPark"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.1c01691\n10.1038/s41467-019-12795-1\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01208\n10.1088/2053-1583/aac764\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c02187\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.01.040\n10.1007/s10825-019-01351-1\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11494\n10.1016/j.carbon.2014.06.023\n10.1038/nature11458\n10.1103/PhysRevB.92.075435\n10.1103/PhysRevB.80.155453\n10.1038/s41598-020-68228-3\n10.1088/0953-8984/25/39/395501\n10.1088/2053-1591/2/1/016301\n10.1038/s41598-020-71766-5\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.04.039\n10.1103/PhysRevB.81.081407\n10.1103/PhysRevB.91.245403\n10.1109/ICECE.2018.8636776\n10.1016/j.elspec.2018.09.003\n10.1063/1.3488620\n10.1088/2053-1591/ab5a96\n10.1088/0022-3727/48/39/395303\n10.1039/d0cp00990c\n10.1016/j.carbon.2020.06.059\n10.1016/j.carbon.2014.08.049\n10.1016/j.diamond.2013.10.013\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2013.06.047\n10.1016/j.nanoso.2019.01.006\n10.1088/2053-1591/aaa73d\n10.1016/j.physb.2018.10.035\n10.1088/1361-6528/abb491\n10.3390/s20102879\n10.1006/jcph.1995.1039\n10.1103/PhysRevB.39.5566\n10.1088/0965-0393/18/1/015012\n10.1088/0022-3727/47/42/425301\n10.1063/1.437577\n10.1088/2053-1591/aa72bf\n10.1016/j.physleta.2019.05.055\n10.1016/j.mseb.2013.10.004\n10.1039/C8RA08076C\n10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.018\n10.1016/j.carbon.2017.03.029\n10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.017\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.09.011\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab3697\n10.1021/acsomega.9b01087\n10.1002/adma.201103965\n10.1140/epjb/e2015-50850-x\n10.1088/0953-8984/27/31/315302\n10.1016/j.npe.2020.03.003\n10.1088/0965-0393/19/5/054006\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109295\n10.1007/s10704-016-0115-9\n10.1016/j.physleta.2020.126993\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2019.122474\n10.1039/c2ra21228e\n10.1016/j.physe.2012.05.007\n10.1021/nl5047686\n10.1039/c8cp07881e"}

{"title": "Visualization of Bubble Nucleation and Growth Confined in 2D Flakes.", "abstract": "The nucleation and growth of bubbles within a solid matrix is a ubiquitous phenomenon that affects many natural and synthetic processes. However, such a bubbling process is almost \"invisible\" to common characterization methods because it has an intrinsically multiphased nature and occurs on very short time/length scales. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy to explore the decomposition of a solid precursor that emits gaseous byproducts, the direct observation of a complete nanoscale bubbling process confined in ultrathin 2D flakes is presented here. This result suggests a three-step pathway for bubble formation in the confined environment: void formation via spinodal decomposition, bubble nucleation from the spherization of voids, and bubble growth by coalescence. Furthermore, the systematic kinetics analysis based on COMSOL simulations shows that bubble growth is actually achieved by developing metastable or unstable necks between neighboring bubbles before coalescing into one. This thorough understanding of the bubbling mechanism in a confined geometry has implications for refining modern nucleation theories and controlling bubble-related processes in the fabrication of advanced materials (i.e., topological porous materials).", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2021-09-03", "authors": ["ZhouyangZhang", "JunQiang", "ShensongWang", "MingXu", "MinGan", "ZhenggangRao", "TingfangTian", "ShanmingKe", "YangboZhou", "YongmingHu", "Chi WahLeung", "Chee LeungMak", "LinfengFei"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.202103301"}

{"title": "Adjustable Acoustic Field Controlled by \"Ultrasonic Projector\" on Ultrasound Application.", "abstract": "The control of acoustic field has great potential in many applications such as medical treatment, neuro-modulation, and bio-imaging. Recently, acoustic lenses and phased arrays have become common ways of controlling acoustic fields. However, the shortcomings of the two ways are obvious. Acoustic lenses lack flexibility after design, and phased arrays have complicated structures and need to adjust the parameters of each array element. In this work, we propose an alternative for sound field control using a flexible and adjustable \"acoustic projector,\" and two symmetric mirrors are used to change the direction of propagation of an acoustic wave produced by a piezoelectric element and realize acoustic focusing in the target region. The 2-D \"acoustic projector\" model was built in finite element simulation, and the feasibility was verified with an actual prototype. The sound intensity produced by the piezoelectric element at different horizontal and vertical positions along the target area can be accurately controlled by two adjustable mirrors. When the angle of the mirror ranges from 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, the focal depth can change from 39 to 140 mm. Furthermore, the focus can be controlled in a sector with an angle of 60\u00b0.

{"title": "Exploration of the Underlying Space in Microscopic Images via Deep Learning for Additively Manufactured Piezoceramics.", "abstract": "There has been a surge of interest in applying deep learning (DL) to microstructure generation and materials design. However, existing DL-based methods are generally limited in generating (1) microstructures with high resolution, (2) microstructures with high variability, (3) microstructures with guaranteed periodicity, and (4) highly controllable microstructures. In this study, a DL approach based on a stacked generative adversarial network (StackGAN-v2) is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. The presented modeling approach can reconstruct high-fidelity microstructures of additively manufactured piezoceramics with different resolutions, which are statistically equivalent to original microstructures either experimentally observed or numerically predicted. Advantages of the proposed modeling approach are also illustrated in terms of its capability in controlling the probability density function (PDF) of grain size, grain orientation, and micropore in a large space, which would have significant benefits in exploring the effects of these microstructure features on the piezoelectricity of piezoceramics. In the meantime, periodicity of the microstructures has been successfully introduced in the developed model, which can critically reduce the simulation volume to be considered as a representative volume element (RVE) during computational calculation of piezoelectric properties. Therefore, this DL approach can significantly accelerate the process of designing optimal microstructures when integrating with computational methods (e.g., fast Fourier spectral iterative perturbation (FSIPM)) to achieve desired piezoelectric properties.

Piezo2 expression was limited to a small subset of superficial umbrella cells, yet male Piezo2-KO mice exhibited incontinence (i.e., leakage) when their voiding behavior was monitored during their active dark phase. Dual Piezo1/2-KO mice had the most affected phenotype, characterized by decreased urothelial responses to mechanical stimulation, diminished ATP release, bladder hypoactivity in anesthetized Piezo1/2-KO females but not males, and urinary incontinence in both male and female Piezo1/2-KO mice during their dark phase but not inactive light one. Our studies reveal that the urothelium functions in a sex- and circadian rhythm-dependent manner to link urothelial PIEZO1/2 channel-driven mechanotransduction to normal voiding function and behavior, and in the absence of these signals, bladder dysfunction ensues.", "journal": "JCI insight", "date": "2021-09-01", "authors": ["Marianela GDalghi", "Wily GRuiz", "Dennis RClayton", "NicolasMontalbetti", "Stephanie LDaugherty", "Jonathan MBeckel", "Marcelo DCarattino", "GerardApodaca"], "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.152984\n10.1038/nrn894\n10.1016/j.tins.2020.10.007\n10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00090-4\n10.1113/expphysiol.2010.053165\n10.1152/physrev.00041.2019\n10.1038/nrurol.2016.13\n10.1007/s00210-018-1510-8\n10.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.685\n10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.003\n10.1038/s41586-020-2933-1\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1038/s41467-018-04405-3\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1038/nrm.2017.92\n10.1002/nau.23400\n10.1074/jbc.M113.528638\n10.1152/ajprenal.00214.2019\n10.1038/s41586-020-2830-7\n10.3389/fgene.2021.620752\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119254\n10.1242/dev.117903\n10.1681/ASN.2019040335\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.042\n10.1038/ncomms11914\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035243\n10.1074/jbc.M110.198069\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2601-12.2012\n10.1038/sj.ki.5002439\n10.1172/JCI24086\n10.1371/journal.pone.0168234\n10.1152/ajprenal.00350.2018\n10.1002/nau.22692\n10.1152/ajprenal.00483.2015\n10.1152/ajprenal.00318.2017\n10.1002/nau.20552\n10.1152/ajprenal.00240.2017\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118735\n10.1126/science.aau6324\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1073/pnas.1804938115\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.08.017\n10.7554/eLife.63049\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.3390/ijms22041594\n10.1152/ajprenal.00403.2002\n10.1172/JCI31766\n10.1038/nn902\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-15-05670.2001\n10.1038/srep29761\n10.1074/jbc.M109902200\n10.1096/fj.12-223404\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.283119\n10.1172/JCI87343\n10.1152/physrev.00030.2012\n10.1113/JP274191\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040346\n10.1074/jbc.R300038200\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.017\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)36889-8\n10.1038/nprot.2008.73\n10.1073/pnas.0805636105\n10.1091/mbc.e12-08-0568\n10.1002/nau.24689\n10.1152/ajprenal.00630.2017\n10.1038/s41593-018-0204-3"}

However, in the conventional PIT, the ultrasound intensity is reduced due to the multiple resonance characteristics of the combined piezoelectric element, and it is challenging to handle the thin piezoelectric layer required to make a PIT-based acoustic stack. In this study, an improved PIT using a piezo-composite layer was proposed to compensate for those problems simultaneously. The novel PIT-based acoustic stack also consists of two piezoelectric layers with opposite poling directions, in which the piezo-composite layer is located on the front side and the bulk-type piezoelectric layer is located on the back side. The thickness ratio between two piezoelectric layers is 0.5:0.5, but unlike a typical PIT model, it can generate dual-frequency spectrum. A finite element analysis (FEA) simulation was conducted, and subsequently, the prototype transducer was fabricated for performance demonstration. In the simulation and experiment, the intensity was increased by 56.76% and 30.88% compared to the conventional PIT model with the thickness ratio of 0.3:0.7.

However, serious self-heating inevitably occurs inside high-power CPETs, severely limiting their practical applications in broader fields. To tackle this, multidirectional heat-escape channels of multidimensional (multi-D, 3D/2D) graphene films are introduced in designing new-type thermal regulators. A porous AlN-ceramic thermal-sink is creatively selected as a template for directly synthesizing graphene via a two-step chemical vapor deposition strategy. This perfect combination of 3D/2D-graphene and the AlN ceramic can integrate their complementary advantages in uniformizing, transmitting, and releasing heat. Amazingly, in the new-generation CPETs embedded with these graphene-based thermal regulators, the self-heating-induced temperature rise can be substantially reduced by \u224860% (far exceeding actual demand standard). As another kernel parameter, electroacoustic-energy-conversion efficiency is dramatically improved in the new-generation CPETs.

{"title": "Visualization of Activated Area on Polymers for Evaluation of Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets.", "abstract": "The treatment of a polymer surface using an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) causes a local increase of the surface free energy (SFE). The plasma-treated zone can be visualized with the use of a test ink and quantitatively evaluated. However, the inked area is shrinking with time. The shrinkage characteristics are collected using activation image recording (AIR). The recording is conducted by a digital camera. The physical mechanisms of activation area shrinkage are discussed. The error sources are analyzed and methods of error reduction are proposed. The standard deviation of the activation area is less than 3%. Three polymers, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polyoxymethylene (POM), are examined as a test substrate material. Due to a wide variation range of SFE and a small hydrophobic recovery, HDPE is chosen. Since the chemical mixtures tend to temporal changes of the stoichiometry, the pure formamide test ink with 58 mN/m is selected. The method is tested for the characterization of five different types of discharge: (i) pulsed arc APPJ with the power of about 700 W; (ii) piezoelectric direct discharge APPJ; (iii) piezoelectric driven needle corona in ambient air; (iv) piezoelectric driven plasma needle in argon; and (v) piezoelectric driven dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). For piezoelectrically driven discharges, the power was either 4.5 W or 8 W.

A thoroughly mixed blend of polymer matrix, ionic liquid and solvent was deposited on a ceramic substrate and was kept at a certain temperature for a specific time in order to achieve varying crystallinity. The morphology of all the electrolytes consists of spherulites whose average diameter increases with solvent evaporation rate. Raman mapping shows that these spherulites have a semicrystalline structure and the area between them is an amorphous region. Analysis of FTIR spectra as well as Raman spectroscopy showed that the \u03b2-phase becomes dominant over other phases, while DSC technique indicated decrease of crystallinity as the solvent evaporation rate increases.

Additionally, organo-montmorillonite (15A) was incorporated simultaneously with the individual carbon fillers to form hybrid filler nanocomposites. Microscopic images confirmed the selective localization of carbon fillers, mainly in the continuous PC phase, while 15A located in the PVDF domains. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that blending PVDF with PC or forming single/double carbon filler composites resulted in lower PVDF crystallization temperature during cooling. However, PVDF crystallization was promoted by the inclusion of 15A, and the growth of \u03b2-form crystals was induced. The rigidity of the CF blend increased after the formation of nanocomposites. Among the three individually added carbon fillers, GnPs improved the CF moduli the most; the simultaneous loading of CNT/GnP resulted in the highest moduli by up to 33%/46% increases in tensile/flexural moduli, respectively, compared with those of the CF blend. Rheological viscosity results showed that adding CNTs increased the complex viscosity of the blend to a greater extent than did adding CB or GnPs, and the viscosity further increased after adding 15A.

The cooling effect of these five PAJs was calculated by employing the thermal analysis method and the convection thermal resistance of the optimal PAJ can be reduced by about 36%, while the voltage frequency, wind speed, and noise were all positively correlated. When the supplied piezoelectric frequency is 300 Hz, the decibel level of the noise is similar to that of a commercial rotary fan. The piezoelectric sheets had one of two diameters of 31 mm or 41 mm depending on the size of the tested PAJs. The power consumption of a single PAJ was less than 10% of that of a rotary fan. Among the five types of PAJ, the optimal one has the characteristics that the diameter of the piezoelectric sheet is 41 mm, the piezoelectric spacing is 2 mm, and the length of the opening is 4 mm.

{"title": "Stochastic Identification of Guided Wave Propagation under Ambient Temperature via Non-Stationary Time Series Models.", "abstract": "In the context of active-sensing guided-wave-based acousto-ultrasound structural health monitoring, environmental and operational variability poses a considerable challenge in the damage diagnosis process as they may mask the presence of damage. In this work, the stochastic nature of guided wave propagation due to the small temperature variation, naturally occurring in the ambient or environment, is rigorously investigated and modeled with the help of stochastic time-varying time series models, for the first time, with a system identification point of view. More specifically, the output-only recursive maximum likelihood time-varying auto-regressive model (RML-TAR) is employed to investigate the uncertainty in guided wave propagation by analyzing the time-varying model parameters. The steps and facets of the identification procedure are presented, and the obtained model is used for modeling the uncertainty of the time-varying model parameters that capture the underlying dynamics of the guided waves. The stochasticity inherent in the modal properties of the system, such as natural frequencies and damping ratios, is also analyzed with the help of the identified RML-TAR model. It is stressed that the narrow-band high-frequency actuation for guided wave propagation excites more than one frequency in the system. The values and the time evolution of those frequencies are analyzed, and the associated uncertainties are also investigated.

{"title": "A Fluidics-Based Double Flexural Membrane Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (PMUT) for Wide-Bandwidth Underwater Acoustic Applications.", "abstract": "In acoustic receiver design, the receiving sensitivity and bandwidth are two primary parameters that determine the performance of a device. The trade-off between sensitivity and bandwidth makes the design very challenging, meaning it needs to be fine-tuned to suit specific applications. The ability to design a PMUT with high receiving sensitivity and a wide bandwidth is crucial to allow a wide spectrum of transmitted frequencies to be efficiently received. This paper presents a novel structure involving a double flexural membrane with a fluidic backing layer based on an in-plane polarization mode to optimize both the receiving sensitivity and frequency bandwidth for medium-range underwater acoustic applications. In this structure, the membrane material and electrode configuration are optimized to produce good receiving sensitivity. Simultaneously, a fluidic backing layer is introduced into the double flexural membrane to increase the bandwidth. Several piezoelectric membrane materials and various electrode dimensions were simulated using finite element analysis (FEA) techniques to study the receiving performance of the proposed structure. The final structure was then fabricated based on the findings from the simulation work. The pulse-echo experimental method was used to characterize and verify the performance of the proposed device. The proposed structure was found to have an improved bandwidth of 56.6% with a receiving sensitivity of -1.8864 dB rel 1 V \u00b5Pa. For the proposed device, the resonance frequency and center frequency were 600 and 662.5 kHz, respectively, indicating its suitability for the targeted frequency range.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-29", "authors": ["Khairul AzmanAhmad", "Mohamad Faizal AbdRahman", "Khairu Anuar MohamedZain", "Muhammad NaimHaron", "Asrulnizam AbdManaf"], "doi": "10.3390/s21165582\n10.1109/ICASERT.2019.8934646\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2010.09.001\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2018.8579826\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2772331\n10.1121/2.0001053\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2844881\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2784810\n10.3390/s19040962\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01907\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2921983\n10.3390/s19194336\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8925804\n10.1109/NEMS.2016.7758253\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2844183\n10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2496300\n10.1109/MEMSYS.2017.7863632\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8926178\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8926015\n10.1109/SPAWDA.2016.7830017\n10.1016/j.jmrt.2021.06.067\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092102\n10.1109/58.883527\n10.1117/12.479924\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.08.012"}
{"title": "Wide Bandwidth Vibration Energy Harvester with Embedded Transverse Movable Mass.", "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges associated with vibration energy harvesters is their limited bandwidth, which reduces their effectiveness when utilized for Internet of Things applications. This paper presents a novel method of increasing the bandwidth of a cantilever beam by using an embedded transverse out-of-plane movable mass, which continuously changes the resonant frequency due to mass change and non-linear dynamic impact forces. The concept was investigated through experimentation of a movable mass, in the form of a solid sphere, that was embedded within a stationary proof mass with hollow cylindrical chambers. As the cantilever oscillated, it caused the movable mass to move out-of-plane, thus effectively altering the overall effective mass of the system during operation. This concept combined high bandwidth non-linear dynamics from the movable mass with the high power linear dynamics from the stationary proof mass. This paper experimentally investigated the frequency and power effects of acceleration, the amount of movable mass, the density of the mass, and the size of the movable mass. The results demonstrated that the bandwidth can be significantly increased from 1.5 Hz to >40 Hz with a transverse movable mass, while maintaining high power output. Dense movable masses are better for high acceleration, low frequency applications, whereas lower density masses are better for low acceleration applications.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-29", "authors": ["NathanJackson", "Luis ARodriguez", "RahulAdhikari"], "doi": "10.3390/s21165517\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.02.028\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1007/s00542-013-2006-6\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/5/055017\n10.1007/s00542-016-3224-5\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.080601\n10.1063/1.3629551\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/6/065006\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/102001\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035005\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2731400\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.042\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/01/015035\n10.3390/mi11050500\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.12.032\n10.1177/1045389X12444940\n10.1038/srep37292\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab62e1\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/105008\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.076\n10.1007/s00542-020-04756-2\n10.1007/s00542-019-04321-6\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab859f\n10.1007/s00542-018-3846-x\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.10.010\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.063\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.627\n10.1063/1.5089289\n10.1007/s00542-020-04999-z\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2574958\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.08.005\n10.1038/srep38798\n10.1115/1.3153712\n10.1088/1361-665X/aad013\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/9/094005\n10.1177/1045389X12436739\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/11/115021\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2039017"}

{"title": "Plate Waves Scattering Analysis and Active Damage Detection.", "abstract": "This study investigates and evaluates the technology of using plate waves to detect the locations and sizes of circular holes and cracks in plates. Piezoelectric ceramic discs surface-mounted on both sides of an aluminum alloy plate were used as narrow-frequency plate wave actuators and sensors, and the antisymmetric plate wave signal was analyzed by wavelet transform in the time-frequency domain. The damage location and frequency spectrum characteristics were identified by the wave through time-of-flight difference and signal analysis of the damage scattered wave group. The plate wave signal of the damaged plate included the scattered wave signal and the plate wave signal transmitted directly between the piezoelectric discs. Under ideal conditions, the plate wave signal indicating damage can be obtained by subtracting the plate wave signal in a plate without damage from the plate wave signal scattered from actuators to sensors. This study established an optimization program based on the simplex algorithm to inversely calculate the location of the plate damage.

{"title": "Wearable Detection of Trunk Flexions: Capacitive Elastomeric Sensors Compared to Inertial Sensors.", "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of flexions of the trunk via wearable sensors could help various types of workers to reduce risks associated with incorrect postures and movements. Stretchable piezo-capacitive elastomeric sensors based on dielectric elastomers have recently been described as a wearable, lightweight and cost-effective technology to monitor human kinematics. Their stretching causes an increase of capacitance, which can be related to angular movements. Here, we describe a wearable wireless system to detect flexions of the trunk, based on such sensors. In particular, we present: (i) a comparison of different calibration strategies for the capacitive sensors, using either an accelerometer or a gyroscope as an inclinometer; (ii) a comparison of the capacitive sensors' performance with those of the accelerometer and gyroscope; to that aim, the three types of sensors were evaluated relative to stereophotogrammetry. Compared to the gyroscope, the capacitive sensors showed a higher accuracy. Compared to the accelerometer, their performance was lower when used as quasi-static inclinometers but also higher in case of highly dynamic accelerations. This makes the capacitive sensors attractive as a complementary, rather than alternative, technology to inertial sensors.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-29", "authors": ["GabrieleFrediani", "LeonardoBocchi", "FedericaVannetti", "GiovanniZonfrillo", "FedericoCarpi"], "doi": "10.3390/s21165453\n10.1097/00007632-200012010-00018\n10.1093/occmed/kqg072\n10.5271/sjweh.1290\n10.1016/S0268-0033(98)00020-5\n10.1177/2472630319891128\n10.1561/2000000094\n10.3390/s141018625\n10.1007/s00586-012-2312-1\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e3182a0dbc5\n10.1186/1743-0003-11-56\n10.3390/s151128435\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.06.017\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.09.015\n10.1109/JSEN.2004.837498\n10.1186/1743-0003-2-8\n10.1155/2018/7480528\n10.1155/2020/9231571\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183651\n10.3390/s17122708\n10.1016/j.ergon.2018.11.007\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103624\n10.1145/3306346.3322957"}

In this study, we propose a wearable bladder scanner system that can continuously measure bladder volume in daily life for urinary patients who need urodynamic studies. The system consisted of a 2-D array, which included integrated forward-looking piezoelectric transducers with thin substrates. This study aims to estimate the volume of the bladder using a small number of piezoelectric transducers. A least-squares method was implemented to optimize an ellipsoid in a quadratic surface equation for bladder volume estimation. Ex-vivo experiments of a pig bladder were conducted to validate the proposed system. This work presents the potential of the approach for wearable bladder monitoring, which has similar measurement accuracy compared to the commercial bladder imaging system.

{"title": "A Flexible Multimodal Sole Sensor for Legged Robot Sensing Complex Ground Information during Locomotion.", "abstract": "Recent achievements in the field of computer vision, reinforcement learning, and locomotion control have largely extended legged robots' maneuverability in complex natural environments. However, little research focuses on sensing and analyzing the physical properties of the ground, which is crucial to robots' locomotion during their interaction with highly irregular profiles, deformable terrains, and slippery surfaces. A biomimetic, flexible, multimodal sole sensor (FMSS) designed for legged robots to identify the ontological status and ground information, such as reaction force mapping, contact situation, terrain, and texture information, to achieve agile maneuvers was innovatively presented in this paper. The FMSS is flexible and large-loaded (20 Pa-800 kPa), designed by integrating a triboelectric sensing coat, embedded piezoelectric sensor, and piezoresistive sensor array. To evaluate the effectiveness and adaptability in different environments, the multimodal sensor was mounted on one of the quadruped robot's feet and one of the human feet then traversed through different environments in real-world tests. The experiment's results demonstrated that the FMSS could recognize terrain, texture, hardness, and contact conditions during locomotion effectively and retrain its sensitivity (0.66 kPa", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-29", "authors": ["YingtianXu", "ZiyaWang", "WanjunHao", "WenyuZhao", "WanerLin", "BingchenJin", "NingDing"], "doi": "10.3390/s21165359\n10.1109/JAS.2018.7511258\n10.1080/001401399184712\n10.3389/frobt.2018.00129\n10.1109/LRA.2019.2931284\n10.1163/156855307781389419\n10.1109/TMECH.2009.2032079\n10.3390/s19010027\n10.3390/s16060819\n10.3390/s20216185\n10.3390/s21134324\n10.1142/S0219843619500361\n10.1038/s41928-018-0116-y\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.08.001\n10.1038/s41467-017-02685-9\n10.1002/adfm.201807569\n10.1021/acsami.0c03326\n10.1088/1361-665X/abff6d\n10.1002/adma.201802084\n10.1002/aenm.201601255\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105216\n10.1038/s41467-019-09461-x\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2299805\n10.1126/scirobotics.aav4282"}

{"title": "Waterproof Graphene-PVDF Wearable Strain Sensors for Movement Detection in Smart Gloves.", "abstract": "In this work, new highly sensitive graphene-based flexible strain sensors are produced. In particular, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanocomposite films filled with different amounts of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are produced and their application as wearable sensors for strain and movement detection is assessed. The produced nanocomposite films are morphologically characterized and their waterproofness, electrical and mechanical properties are measured. Furthermore, their electromechanical features are investigated, under both stationary and dynamic conditions. In particular, the strain sensors show a consistent and reproducible response to the applied deformation and a Gauge factor around 30 is measured for the 1% wt loaded PVDF/GNP nanocomposite film when a deformation of 1.5% is applied.

{"title": "ZnO Polymeric Composite Films for ", "abstract": "Polymeric composite films have been explored for many photocatalytic applications, from water treatment to self-cleaning devices. Their properties, namely, thickness and porosity, are controlled mainly by the preparation conditions. However, little has been discussed on the effect of thickness and porosity of polymeric composite films for photocatalytic processes, especially in gas phase. In the present study, different preparation treatments of ZnO-based polymeric composite films and their effects on its performance and stability were investigated. The polymeric composites were prepared by solution mixing followed by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS), using poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as the matrix and ZnO-based photocatalysts. Different wet thickness, photocatalyst mass, and treatments (e.g., using or not pore-forming agent and compatibilizer) were assessed. A low ZnO/PVDF ratio and higher wet thickness, together with the use of pore-forming agent and compatibilizer, proved to be a good strategy for increasing photocatalytic efficiency given the low agglomerate formation and high polymer transmittance. Nonetheless, the composites exhibited deactivation after several minutes of exposure. Characterization by XRD, FTIR-ATR, and SEM were carried out to further investigate the polymeric film treatments and stability.

{"title": "In Vitro Effect of Replicated Porous Polymeric Nano-MicroStructured Biointerfaces Characteristics on Macrophages Behavior.", "abstract": "In the last decades, optimizing implant properties in terms of materials and biointerface characteristics represents one of the main quests in biomedical research. Modifying and engineering polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as scaffolds becomes more and more attractive to multiples areas of bio-applications (e.g., bone or cochlear implants). Nevertheless, the acceptance of an implant is affected by its inflammatory potency caused by surface-induced modification. Therefore, in this work, three types of nano-micro squared wells like PVDF structures (i.e., reversed pyramidal shape with depths from 0.8 to 2.5 microns) were obtained by replication, and the influence of their characteristics on the inflammatory response of human macrophages was investigated in vitro. FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the maintaining chemical structures of the replicated surfaces, while the topographical surface characteristics were evaluated by AFM and SEM analysis. Contact angle and surface energy analysis indicated a modification from superhydrophobicity of casted materials to moderate hydrophobicity based on the structure's depth change. The effects induced by PVDF casted and micron-sized reversed pyramidal replicas on macrophages behavior were evaluated in normal and inflammatory conditions (lipopolysaccharide treatment) using colorimetric, microscopy, and ELISA methods. Our results demonstrate that the depth of the microstructured surface affects the activity of macrophages and that the modification of topography could influence both the hydrophobicity of the surface and the inflammatory response.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["Luminita NicoletaDumitrescu", "MadalinaIcriverzi", "AncaBonciu", "AncaRo\u0219eanu", "AntoniuMoldovan", "ValentinaDinca"], "doi": "10.3390/nano11081913\n10.1016/j.bsbt.2015.08.002\n10.1038/s41598-017-02605-3\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00235-7\n10.1039/C5RA08388E\n10.1016/j.gene.2021.145471\n10.1080/15368378.2019.1567527\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126510\n10.1088/1748-6041/8/4/045007\n10.1088/1748-605X/ab3c20\n10.3390/molecules25030582\n10.1038/srep35512\n10.1002/jbm.a.35368\n10.1002/jbm.a.35234\n10.1016/j.smim.2007.11.004\n10.1177/1535370216650293\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.07.010\n10.4110/in.2017.17.6.402\n10.1039/C6BM00425C\n10.1039/C4AN01119H\n10.1063/1.4895187\n10.1038/nprot.2017.157\n10.1063/1.3266505\n10.1002/polc.5070340105\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(20000620)76:12<1831::AID-APP14>3.0.CO;2-Q\n10.3390/coatings9040236\n10.1002/jbm.a.34666\n10.1081/MB-100106174\n10.3390/nano10061210\n10.1016/j.pnsc.2012.04.011\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2004.11.022\n10.1080/00222340801954811\n10.1002/app.23137\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2018.01.001\n10.1007/978-3-319-54090-0_13\n10.1016/j.polymer.2014.04.029\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.11.063\n10.3390/ma6083482\n10.1039/C8NR10384D\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.01.044\n10.3390/polym7081444\n10.1016/j.matpr.2019.11.162\n10.1021/ie50320a024\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2006.11.021\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.06.016\n10.1016/j.intimp.2014.08.002\n10.1007/s00011-012-0533-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0193601\n10.1021/acsami.5b10589\n10.1073/pnas.1308887110\n10.1039/C6BM00224B\n10.1021/acsnano.9b00489\n10.1002/admi.201900677\n10.2147/IJN.S254271\n10.1126/sciadv.abf6654\n10.1002/jbm.a.34309\n10.1002/jbm.a.30075\n10.1007/s10439-013-0933-0\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.12.003\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.06.030"}

{"title": "Self-Powered Sensors: New Opportunities and Challenges from Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials.", "abstract": "Nanomaterials have gained considerable attention over the last decade, finding applications in emerging fields such as wearable sensors, biomedical care, and implantable electronics. However, these applications require miniaturization operating with extremely low power levels to conveniently sense various signals anytime, anywhere, and show the information in various ways. From this perspective, a crucial field is technologies that can harvest energy from the environment as sustainable, self-sufficient, self-powered sensors. Here we revisit recent advances in various self-powered sensors: optical, chemical, biological, medical, and gas.

{"title": "Magnetoelectric Memory Based on Ferromagnetic/Ferroelectric Multiferroic Heterostructure.", "abstract": "Electric-field control of magnetism is significant for the next generation of large-capacity and low-power data storage technology. In this regard, the renaissance of a multiferroic compound provides an elegant platform owing to the coexistence and coupling of ferroelectric (FE) and magnetic orders. However, the scarcity of single-phase multiferroics at room temperature spurs zealous research in pursuit of composite systems combining a ferromagnet with FE or piezoelectric materials. So far, electric-field control of magnetism has been achieved in the exchange-mediated, charge-mediated, and strain-mediated ferromagnetic (FM)/FE multiferroic heterostructures. Concerning the giant, nonvolatile, and reversible electric-field control of magnetism at room temperature, we first review the theoretical and representative experiments on the electric-field control of magnetism via strain coupling in the FM/FE multiferroic heterostructures, especially the CoFeB/PMN-PT [where PMN-PT denotes the (PbMn", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["JiaweiWang", "AitianChen", "PeisenLi", "SenZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14164623\n10.1038/nmat2024\n10.1080/00018732.2010.534865\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.3273\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.2472\n10.1016/0304-8853(96)00062-5\n10.1038/nature10309\n10.1142/S2010324712400024\n10.1088/0022-3727/46/7/074003\n10.1088/0953-8984/24/33/333201\n10.1126/science.1113357\n10.1038/nmat1804\n10.1038/nmat1805\n10.1038/nature05023\n10.1038/nmat2125\n10.1038/nmat2826\n10.1038/am.2013.58\n10.1038/nmat2184\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.227201\n10.1038/nature14004\n10.1038/s41467-017-01581-6\n10.1126/sciadv.aat4229\n10.1002/adma.200900278\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.047201\n10.1038/nmat1886\n10.1103/PhysRevB.75.054408\n10.1038/srep00258\n10.1038/srep27501\n10.1038/srep23696\n10.1038/s41563-019-0374-8\n10.1063/1.4943990\n10.1063/1.5078787\n10.1063/5.0005804\n10.1038/s41467-020-16942-x\n10.1002/adma.201502824\n10.1038/nmat3171\n10.1038/nmat3172\n10.1063/1.3247893\n10.1021/nl202537y\n10.1109/TMAG.2011.2148102\n10.1126/science.1184028\n10.1038/nmat3254\n10.1038/srep09749\n10.1038/ncomms5289\n10.1063/1.5120565\n10.1038/s41586-018-0770-2\n10.1063/1.5112089\n10.1103/PhysRevB.83.134408\n10.1063/1.365983\n10.1103/PhysRevB.78.212102\n10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224416\n10.1103/PhysRevB.76.092108\n10.1063/1.3554432\n10.1063/1.3086879\n10.1063/1.3143622\n10.1063/1.3427311\n10.1002/adma.200901131\n10.1002/adfm.200801907\n10.1088/0022-3727/43/1/012001\n10.1088/0022-3727/42/4/045007\n10.1063/1.3377923\n10.1002/adma.201100426\n10.1063/1.3626748\n10.1063/1.3616137\n10.1103/RevModPhys.84.119\n10.1021/nl900723j\n10.1038/nmat2703\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.137203\n10.1038/srep04591\n10.1021/acsami.7b03051\n10.1103/PhysRevB.79.092409\n10.1021/acsami.6b13620\n10.1002/adfm.201706448\n10.1021/acsami.5b10233\n10.1038/srep03727\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.027204\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b05342\n10.1063/1.4823539\n10.1038/am.2016.139\n10.1002/adfm.201002485\n10.1002/adma.201503176\n10.1002/adma.201803612\n10.1038/s41467-020-20528-y\n10.1038/s41467-020-17354-7\n10.1103/PhysRevB.48.7099\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.3060\n10.1016/0304-8853(91)90311-W\n10.1038/ncomms2386\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070813-113315\n10.1038/nmat2189\n10.1038/ncomms1564\n10.1038/nmat3311\n10.1038/nature01501\n10.1063/1.3373593\n10.1063/1.3253706\n10.1038/srep10822\n10.1002/adma.201400617\n10.1063/1.4961670\n10.1038/s41467-018-08061-5\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b04205\n10.1038/srep07507\n10.1063/1.4917228\n10.1088/1361-6528/aa56d4\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab4d21\n10.1021/nl504108m\n10.1038/ncomms2398\n10.1063/1.4923350\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00439\n10.1126/sciadv.aay5141\n10.1021/acsami.7b00284\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01547\n10.1039/D0MH00796J\n10.1021/acsami.9b16904\n10.1126/science.aay7221\n10.1038/s41586-020-1939-z\n10.1038/s41928-019-0314-2\n10.1109/TNANO.2013.2284777\n10.1088/0957-4484/26/24/245202\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.12.034010\n10.1063/5.0042138"}

{"title": "A Curve-Shaped Beam Bistable Piezoelectric Energy Harvester with Variable Potential Well: Modeling and Numerical Simulation.", "abstract": "To improve the energy harvesting performance of an energy harvester, a novel bistable piezoelectric energy harvester with variable potential well (BPEH-V) is proposed by introducing a spring to the external magnet from a curve-shaped beam bistable harvester (CBH-C). First, finite element simulation was performed in COMSOL software to validate that the curved beam configuration was superior to the straight beam in power generation performance, which benefits energy harvesting. Moreover, the nonlinear magnetic model was obtained by using the magnetic dipoles method, and the nonlinear restoring force model of the curve-shaped beam was acquired based on fitting the experimental data. The corresponding coupled governing equations were derived by using generalized Hamilton's principle, the dynamic responses were obtained by solving the coupling equations with the ode45 method. Finally, the numerical simulations showed that the proposed harvester can make interwell oscillations easier due to the spring being efficiently introduced to pull down the potential barrier compared with the conventional bistable harvester. Spring stiffness has a great impact on characteristics of the system, and a suitable stiffness contributes to realize large-amplitude interwell oscillations over a wide range of excitation, especially in the low excitation condition.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["XiaoyuChen", "XuhuiZhang", "LuyangChen", "YanGuo", "FulinZhu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12080995\n10.1007/s10409-020-00928-5\n10.1115/1.4026278\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.073\n10.1007/s00158-020-02714-0\n10.1007/s40820-021-00644-0\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113871\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.011\n10.3390/s18124472\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.07.016\n10.1115/esda2010-25200\n10.1016/j.physd.2010.01.019\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab9238\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.06.003\n10.1063/1.4932947\n10.1063/1.4994111\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa791d\n10.1088/1361-665X/aacbaf\n10.1016/j.jsv.2019.01.038\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.07.047\n10.1007/s00542-018-3778-5\n10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103173\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab809a\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2019.104984\n10.1007/s10409-016-0557-3\n10.1016/j.energy.2020.118752\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112232\n10.1016/j.enconman.2017.05.073\n10.1155/1998/79537"}
{"title": "Recent Advances in Reactive Ion Etching and Applications of High-Aspect-Ratio Microfabrication.", "abstract": "This paper reviews the recent advances in reaction-ion etching (RIE) for application in high-aspect-ratio microfabrication. High-aspect-ratio etching of materials used in micro- and nanofabrication has become a very important enabling technology particularly for bulk micromachining applications, but increasingly also for mainstream integrated circuit technology such as three-dimensional multi-functional systems integration. The characteristics of traditional RIE allow for high levels of anisotropy compared to competing technologies, which is important in microsystems device fabrication for a number of reasons, primarily because it allows the resultant device dimensions to be more accurately and precisely controlled. This directly leads to a reduction in development costs as well as improved production yields. Nevertheless, traditional RIE was limited to moderate etch depths (e.g., a few microns). More recent developments in newer RIE methods and equipment have enabled considerably deeper etches and higher aspect ratios compared to traditional RIE methods and have revolutionized bulk micromachining technologies. The most widely known of these technologies is called the inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and this has become a mainstay for development and production of silicon-based micro- and nano-machined devices.

The goal of sensing using such a system is to index the degree of stress experienced by employees during work and recognize how to improve their work environment. Currently, to realize this, image processing technology with a Web camera is generally used for vital sign sensing. However, it creates a sense of discomfort at work because of a strong sense of surveillance. To truly evaluate a working environment, it is necessary that an employee be unaware of the sensor system and for the system to be as unobtrusive as possible. To overcome these practical barriers, we have developed a new removable piezoelectric sensor incorporated in a piezoelectric poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) braided cord. This cord is soft and flexible, and it does not cause any discomfort when attached to the cushion cover sheet. Thus, it was possible to measure the workload of an employee working from home without the employee being aware of the presence of a sensor. Additionally, we developed a system for storing data in a cloud system. We succeeded in acquiring continuous long-term data on the vital signs of employees during telework using this system.

The commercial polyvinylidene fluoride film transducer LDT1-028K was used in 33 excitation mode. The aerodynamic excitation was created by a centrifugal fan and the base excitation by a cone speaker. The excitations were produced by varying independently the mean airflow velocity and the frequency of base vibration. A capacitive load was used to store the harvested energy. A line laser was employed along with long exposure photography and high-speed video, for the visualization of the piezo film's mode shapes and the measurement of maximum tip deflection. The harvested power was mapped along with the maximum tip deflection of the piezo-film, and a process of optimally combining the two excitation sources for maximum power harvesting is demonstrated. The energy conversion efficiency is defined by means of electrical power output divided by the elastic strain energy rate of change during oscillations. The efficiency was mapped and correlated with resonance conditions and results from other studies. It was observed that the conversion efficiency is related to the phase difference between excitation and response and tends to decrease as the excitation frequency rises.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["Antiopi-MalvinaStamatellou", "Anestis IKalfas"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12080962\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112039\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113720\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.05.016\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111744\n10.1007/s00542-020-05017-y\n10.1002/ente.201700785\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111759\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113061\n10.1088/1361-665x/ab859f\n10.1177/1045389X20952534\n10.1016/j.jweia.2013.03.002\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112472\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111880\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112835\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab870e\n10.1017/jfm.2013.555\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.016\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.04.009\n10.1007/s11071-014-1355-8\n10.1115/1.4029611\n10.1016/j.eml.2017.05.002\n10.1177/1045389X9700801005\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.06.046\n10.1016/0266-8920(95)00020-8\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053002\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/2/025017\n10.1109/IEEESTD.1988.79638\n10.1108/02602280110388315\n10.1080/00150198608245016\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2017.07.028\n10.1007/s11071-011-0035-1\n10.1177/1045389X11435434\n10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112855\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/018\n10.1090/qam/13360\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab9add"}

{"title": "Formation and Elimination of Satellite Droplets during Monodisperse Droplet Generation by Using Piezoelectric Method.", "abstract": "One of the key questions in the generation of monodisperse droplets is how to eliminate satellite droplets. This paper investigates the formation and elimination of satellite droplets during the generation of monodisperse deionized water droplets based on a piezoelectric method. We estimated the effects of two crucial parameters-the pulse frequency for driving the piezoelectric transducer (PZT) tube and the volume flow rate of the pumping liquid-on the generation of monodisperse droplets of the expected size. It was found that by adjusting the pulse frequency to harmonize with the volume flow rate, the satellite droplets can be eliminated through their coalescence with the subsequent mother droplets. An increase in the tuning pulse frequency led to a decrease in the size of the monodisperse droplets generated. Among three optimum conditions (OCs) (OC1: 20 mL/h, 20 kHz; OC2: 30 mL/h, 30 kHz; and OC3: 40 mL/h, 40 kHz), the sizes of the generated monodisperse deionized water droplets followed a bimodal distribution in OC1 and OC2, whereas they followed a Gaussian distribution in OC3. The average diameters were 87.8 \u03bcm (OC1), 85.9 \u03bcm (OC2), and 84.8 \u03bcm (OC3), which were 8.46%, 6.14%, and 4.69% greater than the theoretical one (81.0 \u03bcm), respectively.

{"title": "Research on Trimming Frequency-Increasing Technology for Quartz Crystal Resonator Using Laser Etching.", "abstract": "A quartz crystal resonator (QCR) is an indispensable electronic component in the field of the modern electronics industry. By designing and depositing electrodes of different shapes and thicknesses on a quartz wafer with a certain fundamental frequency, the desired target frequency can be obtained. Affected by factors such as the deposition equipment, mask, wafer size and placement position, it is difficult to accurately obtain the target frequency at a given time, especially for mass-produced QCRs. In this work, a laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used to thin the electrodes of a QCR with a fundamental frequency of 10 MHz. The electrode surface was etched through a preset processing pattern to form a processing method of local thinning of the electrode surface. At the same time, the effect of laser etching on silicon dioxide and resonator performance was analyzed. Satisfactory trimming frequency-increasing results were achieved, such as a frequency modulation accuracy of 1 ppm, frequency distribution with good consistency and equivalent parameters with small changes, by the laser partial etching of the resonator electrode. However, when the surface electrode was etched into using through-holes, the attenuation amplitude of the equivalent parameter became larger, especially in terms of the quality factor (Q), which decreased from 63 K to 1 K, and some resonators which had a serious frequency drift of >40%.

{"title": "Modeling, Validation, and Performance of Two Tandem Cylinder Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters in Water Flow.", "abstract": "This paper studies a novel enhanced energy-harvesting method to harvest water flow-induced vibration with a tandem arrangement of two piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) in the direction of flowing water, through simulation modeling and experimental validation. A mathematical model is established by two individual-equivalent single-degree-of-freedom models, coupled with the hydrodynamic force obtained by computational fluid dynamics. Through the simulation analysis, the variation rules of vibration frequency, vibration amplitude, power generation and the distribution of flow field are obtained. And experimental tests are performed to verify the numerical calculation. The experimental and simulation results show that the upstream piezoelectric energy harvester (UPEH) is excited by the vortex-induced vibration, and the maximum value of performance is achieved when the UPEH and the vibration are resonant. As the vortex falls off from the UPEH, the downstream piezoelectric energy harvester (DPEH) generates a responsive beat frequency vibration. Energy-harvesting performance of the DPEH is better than that of the UPEH, especially at high speed flows. The maximum output power of the DPEH (371.7 \u03bcW) is 2.56 times of that of the UPEH (145.4 \u03bcW), at a specific spacing between the UPEN and the DPEH.

{"title": "Post Orgasmic Illness Syndrome (POIS) and Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS): Do They Have Anything in Common?", "abstract": "Post orgasmic illness syndrome is a rare, mysterious condition with an unknown pathomechanism and uncertain treatment. The symptoms of post orgasmic illness syndrome last about 2-7 days after an ejaculation. The current hypothesis proposes that the primary injury in post orgasmic illness syndrome is an acute compression proprioceptive axonopathy in the muscle spindle, as is suspected in delayed onset muscle soreness. The terminal arbor degeneration-like lesion of delayed onset muscle soreness is theorized to be an acute stress response energy-depleted dysfunctional mitochondria-induced impairment of Piezo2 channels and glutamate vesicular release. The recurring symptoms of post orgasmic illness syndrome after each ejaculation are suggested to be analogous to the repeated bout effect of delayed onset muscle soreness. However, there are differences in the pathomechanism, mostly attributed to the extent of secondary tissue damage and to the extent of spermidine depletion. The spermidine depletion-induced differences are as follows: modulation of the acute stress response, flu-like symptoms, opioid-like withdrawal and enhanced deregulation of the autonomic nervous system. The longitudinal dimension of delayed onset muscle soreness, in the form of post orgasmic illness syndrome and the repeated bout effect, have cognitive and memory consequences, since the primary injury is learning and memory-related.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["Bal\u00e1zsSonkodi", "ZsoltKopa", "P\u00e9terNyir\u00e1dy"], "doi": "10.3390/cells10081867\n10.1038/s41443-020-0314-9\n10.21037/tau.2016.07.01\n10.1111/jsm.12813\n10.1016/j.sxmr.2017.08.006\n10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02166.x\n10.1186/s12610-019-0093-7\n10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02167.x\n10.1016/j.esxm.2017.12.004\n10.1016/j.acuroe.2013.03.004\n10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01707.x\n10.1016/j.purol.2017.03.007\n10.3390/antiox9030212\n10.1249/00005768-199205000-00004\n10.1007/BF00635995\n10.1007/s12576-015-0397-0\n10.2165/00007256-200333020-00005\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.1111/andr.12779\n10.1054/jpai.2001.22496\n10.1016/S0304-3959(03)00257-4\n10.1152/physrev.00048.2011\n10.3390/brainsci11010108\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07652.x\n10.3390/life11050443\n10.1016/0031-9384(83)90277-9\n10.1002/mus.24500\n10.1016/j.juro.2014.10.050\n10.1152/ajpregu.00004.2012\n10.1016/0006-8993(79)90742-X\n10.1097/MD.0000000000013135\n10.1100/tsw.2010.112\n10.1016/0014-4886(75)90193-4\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.08.012\n10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.06.018\n10.1007/s40279-013-0083-4\n10.1016/j.psc.2014.08.008\n10.1111/joa.12309\n10.1016/j.phrs.2016.03.023\n10.1016/j.jphs.2018.04.002\n10.1016/j.regpep.2004.02.011\n10.1016/j.pbb.2005.01.031\n10.1016/j.pbb.2005.01.021\n10.1111/j.1369-1600.2008.00107.x\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705628\n10.1042/bj2510559\n10.1186/1744-8069-6-74\n10.3390/biom10040628\n10.4161/auto.26918\n10.1097/00005768-200109000-00011\n10.3389/fnint.2015.00063\n10.1016/0006-8993(79)91009-6\n10.1016/j.nlm.2004.07.004\n10.1016/j.eucr.2019.101078\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)37819-0\n10.1016/S0140-6736(96)91680-3\n10.1113/JP281624\n10.1007/s00424-014-1578-z\n10.1038/s41586-020-2830-7\n10.1152/jappl.1999.87.6.2007\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00536\n10.1023/A:1019996809849\n10.1113/jphysiol.2004.074799\n10.1113/JP281182"}

{"title": "Electrophysiological and Molecular Mechanisms of Sinoatrial Node Mechanosensitivity.", "abstract": "The understanding of the electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie mechanosensitivity of the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker of the heart, has been evolving over the past century. The heart is constantly exposed to a dynamic mechanical environment; as such, the SAN has numerous canonical and emerging mechanosensitive ion channels and signaling pathways that govern its ability to respond to both fast (within second or on beat-to-beat manner) and slow (minutes) timescales. This review summarizes the effects of mechanical loading on the SAN activity and reviews putative candidates, including fast mechanoactivated channels (Piezo, TREK, and BK) and slow mechanoresponsive ion channels [including volume-regulated chloride channels and transient receptor potential (TRP)], as well as the components of mechanochemical signal transduction, which may contribute to SAN mechanosensitivity. Furthermore, we examine the structural foundation for both mechano-electrical and mechanochemical signal transduction and discuss the role of specialized membrane nanodomains, namely, caveolae, in mechanical regulation of both membrane and calcium clock components of the so-called coupled-clock pacemaker system responsible for SAN automaticity. Finally, we emphasize how these mechanically activated changes contribute to the pathophysiology of SAN dysfunction and discuss controversial areas necessitating future investigations. Though the exact mechanisms of SAN mechanosensitivity are currently unknown, identification of such components, their impact into SAN pacemaking, and pathological remodeling may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of SAN dysfunction and associated rhythm abnormalities.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2021-08-27", "authors": ["DanielTurner",

When the co-inoculation resulted in a statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b705) increase in the number of nodules and improved plant biomass compared with single inoculation, we sequenced and analysed its genome to gain a better understanding of the genetic determinants responsible for the observed PGPR traits.

In this study, bulk-CN (BCN), carbon defects CN (CCN), nitrogen defect CN (DCN), mesoporous CN (MCN), and nitrogen-rich CN (NCN) were incorporated into PVDF by phase inversion method. The influence of changes in the physical and chemical properties of CN, including hydrophilic groups, photocatalytic activity, and particle size, on the permeability, anti-fouling characteristic, and photocatalytic self-cleaning activity of CN/PVDF was systematically analyzed. The mechanism of excellent performance of PCM was revealed by experimental test and theoretical calculation. The flux of PCM was significantly improved by increasing the hydrophilic group on modified CN.

Here, the dynamic response of tendon cells to a piezoelectric collagen-analogue scaffold comprised of aligned nanoscale fibers made of the ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) is shown. It is demonstrated that motion-powered electromechanical stimulation of tendon tissue through piezo-bioelectric device results in ion channel modulation in vitro and regulates specific tissue regeneration signaling pathways. Finally, the potential of the piezo-bioelectronic device in modulating the progression of tendinopathy-associated processes in vivo, using a rat Achilles acute injury model is shown. This study indicates that electromechanical stimulation regulates mechanosensitive ion channel sensitivity and promotes tendon-specific over non-tenogenic tissue repair processes.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2021-08-24", "authors": ["Marc AFernandez-Yague", "AlexandreTrotier", "SecilDemir", "Sunny AkogwuAbbah", "AitorLarra\u00f1aga", "ArunThirumaran", "AimeeStapleton", "Syed A MTofail", "MatteoPalma", "MichelleKilcoyne", "AbhayPandit", "Manus JBiggs"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202008788"}

A piezoelectric nanogenerator was fabricated via sonochemical synthesis of SbSeI nanowires compressed into a bulk sample. The prepared device was used to develop two fast and simple evaluation methods for acoustic power in liquid. A calibration procedure was carried out for both methods using a VCX-750 ultrasonic processor. The ultrasound acoustic power was varied within a 150\u00a0W to 750\u00a0W range and the corresponding nanogenerator electrical responses were measured. The voltage signals of the first method fit the best with theoretical dependence. The second technique was based on the application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the measured electric output. The results of these two approaches were convergent. Acoustic power values of 255(8) W and 222(7) W were determined for the Sonic-6 reactor using theoretical dependence fitting to experimental data and FFT analysis, respectively.

Employing joint theoretical-statistical analyses, we develop universal models for quantifying the piezoelectricity of three-coordinated honeycomb-like monolayers at the atomistic level. The theoretical model within the framework of modern polarization theory suggests that the distribution of effective Berry curvature is essential for interpreting the relation between microscopic/electronic structures and piezoelectric properties. The statistical model based on DFT high-throughput calculation reveals that 2D piezoelectricity crucially depends on the effective mass, bandgap, and atomic distance along the rotation axis.

However, there still lacks a cost-effective, energy-saving, and computational complexity-reducing solution for this specific demand. Here, a motion capturing and energy harvesting hybridized lower-limb (MC-EH-HL) system with 3D printing is demonstrated. It enables low-frequency biomechanical energy harvesting with a sliding block-rail piezoelectric generator (S-PEG) and lower-limb motion sensing with a ratchet-based triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG). A unique S-PEG is proposed with particularly designed mechanical structures to convert lower-limb 3D motion into 1D linear sliding on the rail. On the one hand, high output power is achieved with the S-PEG working at a very low frequency, which realizes self-sustainable systems for wireless sensing under the Internet of Things framework. On the other hand, the R-TENG gives rise to digitalized triboelectric output, matching the rotation angles to the pulse numbers. Additional physical parameters can be estimated to enrich the sensory dimension. Accordingly, demonstrative rehabilitation, human-machine interfacing in virtual reality, and sports monitoring are presented.

For further enhancing output performance of PENG, chemical modification and structural design for piezoelectric fillers are effective ways. Thus, the 3D porous hetero-structure fillers of BCZT@Ag are prepared by freeze-drying method and subsequent chemical seeding reduction. The silicone rubber as matrix is filled into the micro-voids of fillers to prepare specialized composite. The charge transport mechanism and stress transfer efficiency in PENG can be effectively improved through specialized design which is proven by experimental results and multi-physics simulations. The improved PENG exhibit a significantly enhanced output of 38.6\u00a0V and 5.85 \u00b5A, which is 3.3 and 3.5 times higher than those of PENG without specific design.

First, the bending vibration of the rectangular transducer is divided into two bending vibrations of the thin rods in the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions using the equivalent elastic method. When the mechanical coupling coefficient is introduced and combined with the anisotropic piezoelectric equations, the resonance frequency equations of the thickness-polarized transducer are derived with simply supported boundary conditions. Then the bending vibration of the transducer is numerically simulated. The results show that the resonance frequency obtained by the analytical method is in good agreement with the numerical simulation results. Finally, the influence of geometrical size and two-phase volume ratio on the bending vibration performance of the transducer is analyzed.

The design and verification of a path length controller performance requires long (up to 3 months), expensive and precise production steps to be successfully terminated. In this study, a combined computational-experimental design framework was developed to control, optimize and verify the performance of the path length controller, without the need for ring laser gyroscope assembly. A novel framework was structured such that the piezoelectric performance characteristics were calculated using finite element analysis. Then, a stand-alone measurement system was developed to verify the finite element analysis results before system integration.

{"title": "Development of Hybrid Piezoelectric-Fibre Optic Composite Patch Repair Solutions.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a hybrid structural health monitoring (SHM) solution for a smart composite patch repair for aircraft structures based on piezoelectric (PZT) and fibre optic (FO) sensors to monitor the integrity of a the bondline and detect any degradation. FO sensors are used to acquire guided waves excited by PZT transducers to allow the advantages of both sensor technologies to be utilised. One of the main challenges of guided wave based detection methodologies is to distinguish the effect of temperature on the propagating waves, from that of an existing damage. In this research, the application of the hybrid SHM system is tested on a composite step sanded repair coupon under operational condition (temperature variation) representative of an aircraft for the first time. The sensitivity of the embedded FO sensor in recording the strain waves is compared to the signals acquired by PZT sensors under varying temperature. A novel compensation algorithm is proposed to correct for the effect of the temperature on the embedded FO sensor spectrum in the hybrid set-up.

{"title": "Passive Electrical Damping of a Quartz Tuning Fork as a Path to Fast Resonance Tracking in QEPAS.", "abstract": "In Quartz-Enhanced PhotoAcoustic Spectroscopy (QEPAS) gas sensors, the acoustic wave is detected by the piezoelectric Quartz Tuning Fork (QTF). Due to its high-quality factor, the QTF can detect very low-pressure variations, but its resonance can also be affected by the environmental variations (temperature, humidity, \u2026), which causes an unwanted signal drift. Recently, we presented the RT-QEPAS technique that consistently corrects the signal drift by continuously measuring the QTF resonance. In this article, we present an improvement of RT-QEPAS to fasten the QTF characterization time by adding a passive electronic circuit, which causes the damping of the QTF resonance. The damping circuit is optimized analytically and through SPICE simulation. The results are supported by experimental observations, showing a 70 times improvement of the relaxation times compared to the lone QTF, which opens the way to a fast and drift-free QEPAS sensor.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-11", "authors": ["RomanRousseau", "DibaAyache", "WiolettaTrzpil", "MichaelBahriz", "AuroreVicet"], "doi": "10.3390/s21155056\n10.1364/OL.27.001902\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.039\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2758640\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128247\n10.3390/app9245347\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2943388\n10.3390/s19245565\n10.1119/1.2711826\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/5/322"}

In this work, a novel presentation of in situ 3D printing and poling of PVDF-TrFE is shown with a d33 performance of up to 18 pC N-1, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously reported in situ poled polymer piezoelectrics. This finding paves the way forward for pressure sensors with much higher sensitivity and accuracy. In addition, the ability of in situ pole sensors to demonstrate different performance levels is shown in a fully 3D-printed five-element sensor array, accelerating and increasing the design space for complex sensing arrays.

{"title": "Graphene and Iron Reinforced Polymer Composite Electromagnetic Shielding Applications: A Review.", "abstract": "With advancements in the automated industry, electromagnetic inferences (EMI) have been increasing over time, causing major distress among the end-users and affecting electronic appliances. The issue is not new and major work has been done, but unfortunately, the issue has not been fully eliminated. Therefore, this review intends to evaluate the previous carried-out studies on electromagnetic shielding materials with the combination of Graphene@Iron, Graphene@Polymer, Iron@Polymer and Graphene@Iron@Polymer composites in X-band frequency range and above to deal with EMI. VOSviewer was also used to perform the keyword analysis which shows how the studies are interconnected. Based on the carried-out review it was observed that the most preferable materials to deal with EMI are polymer-based composites which showed remarkable results. It is because the polymers are flexible and provide better bonding with other materials. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyaniline (PANI), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are effective in the X-band frequency range, and PDMS, epoxy, PVDF and PANI provide good shielding effectiveness above the X-band frequency range.

{"title": "Recent Progress in the Membrane Distillation and Impact of Track-Etched Membranes.", "abstract": "Membrane distillation (MD) is a rapidly developing field of research and finds applications in desalination of water, purification from nonvolatile substances, and concentration of various solutions. This review presents data from recent studies on the MD process, MD configuration, the type of membranes and membrane hydrophobization. Particular importance has been placed on the methods of hydrophobization and the use of track-etched membranes (TeMs) in the MD process. Hydrophobic TeMs based on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polycarbonate (PC) have been applied in the purification of water from salts and pesticides, as well as in the concentration of low-level liquid radioactive waste (LLLRW). Such membranes are characterized by a narrow pore size distribution, precise values of the number of pores per unit area and narrow thickness.

{"title": "A Comparative Study on the Role of Polyvinylpyrrolidone Molecular Weight on the Functionalization of Various Carbon Nanotubes and Their Composites.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanocomposites filled with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) wrapped carbon nanotubes were prepared via a solution casting technique. The effect of the molecular weight (polymer chain length) of the PVP on the ability to wrap different nanotube structures and its impact towards nanotube dispersibility in the polymer matrix was explored. The study was conducted with PVP of four different molecular weights and nanotubes of three different structures. The composites that exhibit an effective nanotube dispersion lead to a nanotube network that facilitates improved thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties. It was observed that nanotubes of different structures exhibit stable dispersions in the polymer matrix though PVP functionalization of different molecular weights, but the key is achieving an effective nanotube dispersion at low PVP concentrations. This is observed in MWNT and AP-SWNT based composites with PVP of low molecular weight, leading to a thermal conductivity enhancement of 147% and 53%, respectively, while for P3-SWNT based composites, PVP of high molecular weight yields an enhancement of 25% in thermal conductivity compared to the non-functionalized CNT-PVDF composite.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-08-11", "authors": ["MuthuramanNamasivayam", "Mats RAndersson", "Joseph GShapter"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13152447\n10.1177/0021998306067321\n10.1080/03602559.2016.1233269\n10.1039/C9NR00117D\n10.1038/354056a0\n10.1038/363603a0\n10.1002/app.10436\n10.1063/1.123330\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.06.003\n10.1063/1.1469696\n10.3390/polym11010162\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.08.051\n10.1088/0957-4484/18/23/235701\n10.1080/03602559.2016.1185630\n10.1002/app.49718\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2016.11.015\n10.1021/ma3018876\n10.1002/pi.2965\n10.1021/acsami.6b03451\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.07.003\n10.1021/ma060733p\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.03.002\n10.1063/1.1736328\n10.1007/978-81-322-2470-9_6\n10.1039/C3RA44906H\n10.1016/j.microc.2020.105836\n10.1016/j.cherd.2019.12.016\n10.1021/jp057501x\n10.1007/s10854-021-05623-0\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118773\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2014.10.019\n10.1021/jp510369a\n10.1021/acsami.1c05319\n10.3390/nano11051234\n10.1016/j.polymer.2020.123258\n10.3390/nano2040329\n10.1002/pen.23236\n10.1088/0957-0233/12/6/303\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2007.10.005\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.065502\n10.1002/masy.201400162"}

{"title": "PVDF Fibers Modification by Nitrate Salts Doping.", "abstract": "The method of inclusion of various additives into a polymer depends highly on the material in question and the desired effect. In the case of this paper, nitride salts were introduced into polyvinylidene fluoride fibers prepared by electrospinning.

{"title": "Effects of vibratory feedback stimuli through an oral appliance on sleep bruxism: a 6-week intervention trial.", "abstract": "Various biofeedback stimulation techniques of managing sleep bruxism (SB) have recently emerged; however, the effect of successive application of vibratory feedback stimulation has not been clarified. This study elucidated the effect of vibration feedback stimulation via an oral appliance (OA) on SB when vibration feedback was applied for 4\u00a0weeks.\nThis was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, intervention study. Ten participants diagnosed with \"definite\" SB wore a specially designed OA for 45 nights in a home-setting. A force-based SB detection system, including a pressure-sensitive piezoelectric film placed internally in the OA, triggered a vibrator attached to the OA. Vibratory stimulation was withheld during the first 2-week adaptation period (1st-15th nights), applied during the 4-week stimulation period (16th-43rd nights), and again withheld during the post-stimulation period (44th and 45th nights). The number and duration of SB episodes/hour of sleep were calculated based on masseter electromyographic activity recorded with in-home portable polysomnography and compared between the 15th and 45th nights (without stimulation) and the 17th and 43rd nights (with stimulation).\nThe number and duration of SB episodes significantly decreased after vibratory stimulation (15th vs. 17th nights: p\u2009=\u20090.012 and p\u2009=\u20090.012, respectively), then significantly increased upon cessation of vibratory stimulation after the stimulation period (43rd vs. 45th nights: p\u2009=\u20090.023 and p\u2009=\u20090.023, respectively).\nContingent vibratory stimulation through an OA may suppress SB-related masticatory muscle activity continuously for 4\u00a0weeks and may be an effective alternative for the management of SB.\nhttps://jrct.niph.go.jp/ ; trial registration number: jRCTs032190225.", "journal": "Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung", "date": "2021-08-10", "authors": ["HironobuOhara", "MasayukiTakaba", "YukaAbe", "YukariNakazato", "RisaAoki", "YuyaYoshida", "TakeshiSuganuma", "KazuyoshiBaba"], "doi": "10.1007/s11325-021-02460-7\n10.5664/jcsm.6470\n10.1111/jsr.12481\n10.1016/S0022-3913(12)00086-8\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.02.013\n10.1111/joor.12558\n10.1016/j.cden.2012.01.003\n10.1111/jsr.12442\n10.1111/joor.12322\n10.3109/00016357.2012.741702\n10.1067/mpr.2003.82\n10.1067/mpr.2001.114270\n10.1111/j.1365-2842.2005.01576.x\n10.1111/joor.12251\n10.1007/s11325-019-01782-x\n10.1111/joor.13182\n10.1007/s00784-020-03270-z\n10.1177/154405910408300509\n10.5664/jcsm.6618\n10.5664/jcsm.7278\n10.1111/joor.12011\n10.1111/joor.12663\n10.1177/00220345960750010601\n10.1177/154405910708600906\n10.1111/joor.12233\n10.5664/jcsm.3152\n10.1016/j.jpor.2019.04.003\n10.1111/joor.12207"}

{"title": "Low-Computational-Cost Technique for Modeling Macro Fiber Composite Piezoelectric Actuators Using Finite Element Method.", "abstract": "The large number of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) in a macro fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric actuator dictates using a very fine finite element (FE) mesh that requires extremely large computational costs, especially with a large number of actuators. The situation becomes infeasible if repeated finite element simulations are required, as in control tasks. In this paper, an efficient technique is proposed for modeling MFC using a finite element method. The proposed technique replaces the MFC actuator with an equivalent simple monolithic piezoceramic actuator using two electrodes only, which dramatically reduces the computational costs. The proposed technique was proven theoretically since it generates the same electric field, strain, and displacement as the physical MFC. Then, it was validated with the detailed FE model using the actual number of IDEs, as well as with experimental tests using triaxial rosette strain gauges. The computational costs for the simplified model compared with the detailed model were dramatically reduced by about 74% for memory usage, 99% for result file size, and 98.6% for computational time. Furthermore, the experimental results successfully verified the proposed technique with good consistency. To show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, it was used to simulate a morphing wing covered almost entirely by MFCs with low computational cost.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-08", "authors": ["DiaaEmad", "Mohamed AFanni", "Abdelfatah MMohamed", "ShigeoYoshida"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14154316\n10.1016/S0888-3270(03)00081-5\n10.1177/1045389X9500600305\n10.3390/ma14061405\n10.3390/ma14092405\n10.3390/ma14123240\n10.1590/S1678-58782012000500004\n10.3390/act7020023\n10.3390/ma13214925\n10.1002/nme.6772\n10.1016/j.compgeo.2020.103856\n10.1016/j.cma.2016.09.039\n10.1007/s11831-018-9258-3\n10.1016/j.cma.2020.113580\n10.1016/j.cma.2021.113957\n10.1016/j.camwa.2021.05.014\n10.3390/fluids6010016\n10.3390/vibration4010014\n10.1177/1045389X17708039\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.11.025\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2011\n10.1177/0021998304040555\n10.1177/1045389X16642537\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/2/025026\n10.1177/1045389X17698590\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.998.221\n10.1177/1045389X06059501\n10.1016/j.cja.2016.07.002\n10.1109/TAC.2009.2012984\n10.1002/stc.96\n10.1109/TIE.2009.2015752\n10.1080/00207170902736307\n10.1109/TMECH.2017.2703167\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.03.048\n10.1177/002199837100500214"}

{"title": "Dielectrophoresis Structurization of PZT/PDMS Micro-Composite for Elastronic Function: Towards Dielectric and Piezoelectric Enhancement.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials have been used for decades in the field of sensors as transducers and energy harvesters. Among these, piezoelectric composites are emerging being extremely advantageous in terms of production, costs, and versatility. However, the piezoelectric performances of a composite with randomly dispersed filler are not comparable with bulk ferroelectric ceramics and electroactive polymers. In order to achieve highly performing and low-cost materials, this work aims to develop flexible composites made of Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) filler in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, with a specific internal structure called quasi-1-3 connectivity. Such a structure, comprising particles arranged in columns along a preferred direction, is performed through dielectrophoresis by applying an alternating electric field on the composite before and during the polymerization. The developed flexible material could be introduced into complex structures in various application fields, as sensors for structural monitoring.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-08-08", "authors": ["GiuliaD'Ambrogio", "OmarZahhaf", "Minh-QuyenLe", "Jean-FabienCapsal", "Pierre-JeanCottinet"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14154071\n10.1533/9781845699758.1.318\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1503962\n10.3390/s140814526\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/3/033001\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.02.023\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.02.014\n10.1109/TIE.2019.2937063\n10.3390/polym13132166\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1958.tb12903.x\n10.1007/s10854-019-02650-w\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2014.01.020\n10.1016/j.orgel.2019.01.028\n10.1002/polb.24280\n10.1002/polb.23776\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.06.071\n10.3390/polym10030263\n10.1080/07315178608202472\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.12.025\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.12.039\n10.1007/s00339-017-0970-x\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2727340\n10.1007/s10439-012-0708-z\n10.1007/s10832-007-9044-3\n10.1002/adem.202100341\n10.1002/adfm.202010962\n10.1021/acsnano.0c01804\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104941\n10.3390/nano11071712\n10.1016/j.actamat.2008.04.031\n10.1016/0025-5408(78)90185-X\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/10/105030\n10.1063/1.3291131\n10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108783\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.08.019\n10.1023/A:1004638825477\n10.1177/1045389X9500600203\n10.1002/polb.24763\n10.1002/mame.202100211\n10.1002/adem.202000773\n10.1557/JMR.1998.0027\n10.1177/1045389X17689928\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2009.06.050\n10.1016/j.matdes.2021.109912\n10.1002/adma.201802560\n10.1002/adma.201902743\n10.1080/14658011.2016.1165903\n10.3390/s19122763\n10.3390/mi8030069\n10.1038/s41563-021-00921-8\n10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108712"}

The direct two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method was utilized to ensure high-quality materials' synthesis and scalable production of different architectures. Iron-based universal compound molecular ink was used as a catalyst in both processes (a) to form a monolayer of horizontally defined networks of SWCNTs interfaced with vertically oriented ZnO NWs and (b) to grow densely packed ZnO NWs directly on a graphene surface. We show here that our universal compound molecular ink is efficient and selective in the direct synthesis of ZnO NWs/CNTs and ZnO NWs/Gr heterostructures. Heterostructures were also selectively patterned through different fabrication techniques and grown in predefined locations, demonstrating an ability to control materials' placement and morphology. Several characterization tools were employed to interrogate the prepared heterostructures. ZnO NWs were shown to grow uniformly over the network of SWCNTs, and much denser packed vertically oriented ZnO NWs were produced on graphene thin films.

{"title": "Exploring electroactive microenvironments in polymer-based nanocomposites to sensitize bacterial cells to low-dose embedded silver nanoparticles.", "abstract": "The search for alternative antimicrobial strategies capable of avoiding resistance mechanisms in bacteria are highly needed due to the alarming emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The application of physical stimuli as a mean of sensitizing bacteria for the action of antimicrobials on otherwise resistant bacteria or by allowing the action of low quantity of antimicrobials may be seen as a breakthrough for such purpose. This work proposes the development of antibacterial nanocomposites using the synergy between the electrically active microenvironments, created by a piezoelectric polymer (poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE)), with green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The electrical microenvironment is generated via mechanical stimulation of piezoelectric PVDF-TrFE/AgNPs films using a lab-made mechanical bioreactor. The generated material's electrical response further translates to bacterial cells, namely Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis which in combination with AgNPs and the specific morphological features of the material induce important antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. Both porous and non-porous PVDF composites have shown antibacterial characteristics when stimulated at a mechanical frequency of 4\u00a0Hz being the effect boosted when AgNPs were incorporated in the nanocomposite, reducing in more than 80% the S. epidermidis bacterial growth in planktonic and biofilm form. The electroactive environments sensitize the bacteria allowing the action of a low dose of AgNPs (1.69% (w/w)). Importantly, the material did not compromise the viability of mammalian cells, thus being considered biocompatible. The piezoelectric stimulation of PVDF-based polymeric films may represent a breakthrough in the development of antibacterial coatings for devices used at hospital setting, taking advantage on the use of mechanical stimuli (pressure/touch) to exert antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The application of physical methods in alternative to the common chemical ones is seen as a breakthrough for avoiding the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial strategies that take advantage on the capability of bacteria to sense physical stimuli such as mechanical and electrical cues are scarce. Electroactive nanocomposites comprised of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) and green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were developed to obtain material able to inhibit the colonization of microorganisms. By applying a mechanical stimuli to the nanocomposite, which ultimately mimics movements such as walking or touching, an antimicrobial effect is obtained, resulting from the synergy between the electroactive microenvironments created on the surface of the material and the AgNPs. Such environments sensitize the bacteria to low doses of antimicrobials.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2021-08-07", "authors": ["JoanaMoreira", "Margarida MFernandes", "Estela OCarvalho", "AnaNicolau", "VesnaLazic", "Jovan MNedeljkovi\u0107", "SenentxuLanceros-Mendez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2021.07.067"}

However, the transmitted power using ultrasound so far is insufficient for driving the existing IMDs. Moreover, the size of the receiving transducer is larger, which is not suitable for implantation. To increase the output power and reduce the size of the implantable receiver, this article presents a method of combining focused ultrasound with a miniaturized 1-3 piezoelectric composite receiving transducer to produce higher electrical power. An analytical fluid-structure interaction model is constructed to fully understand the operating mechanism of the receiving transducer under ultrasonic force. In our experiments, a miniaturized 1-3 piezoelectric composite receiving transducer with a diameter of 3.7 mm was used. The output power generated from the receiving transducer reached 60 mW at a distance of 150 mm. In vitro and in vivo animal experiments proved that the miniaturized transducer could successfully receive focused ultrasonic energy and convert it to electrical power.

{"title": "Development of a Rotary Ultrasonic Motor with Double-Sided Staggered Teeth.", "abstract": "Based on the conventional structure of traveling wave ultrasonic motor, a rotary ultrasonic motor with double-sided staggered teeth was proposed. Both sides of the stator could be used to actuate the rotors to rotate and output torque. Moreover, the staggered teeth in the stator could be dedicated to accommodating the piezoelectric ceramic chips. Under the excitation of two alternating voltages with a 90\u00b0 phase difference, a traveling wave could be generated in the ring-like stator. Then, a rotary motion could be realized by means of the friction between the rotors and the driving teeth of the stator. The finite element method was adopted to analyze the motion trajectories of the driving tips.

Self-powered sensors can be used to implement energy-saving strategies in robots and reduce their power consumption, owing to their low-power consumption characteristics. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and piezoelectric transducer (PE) are important implementations of self-powered sensors. Hybrid sensors combine the advantages of the PE and TENG to achieve higher sensitivity, wider measurement range, and better output characteristics. This paper summarizes the principles and research status of pressure sensors, displacement sensors, and three-dimensional (3D) acceleration sensors based on the self-powered TENG, PE, and hybrid sensors.

{"title": "Diffusivity Measurement by Single-Molecule Recycling in a Capillary Microchannel.", "abstract": "Microfluidic devices have been extensively investigated in recent years in fields including ligand-binding analysis, chromatographic separation, molecular dynamics, and DNA sequencing. To prolong the observation of a single molecule in aqueous buffer, the solution in a sub-micron scale channel is driven by a electric field and reversed after a fixed delay following each passage, so that the molecule passes back and forth through the laser focus and the time before irreversible photobleaching is extended. However, this practice requires complex chemical treatment to the inner surface of the channel to prevent unexpected sticking to the surface and the confined space renders features, such as a higher viscosity and lower dielectric constant, which slow the Brownian motion of the molecule compared to the bulk solution. Additionally, electron beam lithography used for the fabrication of the nanochannel substantially increases the cost, and the sub-micron dimensions make the molecule difficult to locate. In this paper, we propose a method of single-molecule recycling in a capillary microchannel. A commercial fused-silica capillary with an inner diameter of 2 microns is chopped into a 1-inch piece and is fixed onto a cover slip. Two o-rings on the sides used as reservoirs and an o-ring in the middle used as observation window are glued over the capillary. The inner surface of the capillary is chemically processed to reduce the non-specific sticking and to improve capillary effect. The device does not require high-precision fabrication and thus is less costly and easier to prepare than the nanochannel. 40 nm Fluospheres", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-08-07", "authors": ["BoWang", "Lloyd MDavis"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12070800\n10.1146/annurev.physchem.55.111803.143246\n10.1103/RevModPhys.87.1183\n10.1063/1.1589587\n10.1038/nchem.545\n10.1021/nl203719v\n10.1073/pnas.0610081104\n10.1364/OL.32.002729\n10.1021/ac8021899\n10.1364/OE.22.005641\n10.1364/OE.27.029759\n10.1063/1.1872220\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.118102\n10.1364/OE.16.006941\n10.1021/nl301341m\n10.1021/ac9700742\n10.1117/12.2252555\n10.1021/ac025808b\n10.1039/C8LC00458G\n10.1002/bip.1978.360170208\n10.1109/TIT.1960.1057571\n10.2174/1389201033377337\n10.1039/b505122c\n10.1073/pnas.0509976103\n10.1103/PhysRevE.85.061916\n10.1103/PhysRevE.94.022401\n10.1364/OSAC.412390\n10.1002/bip.1974.360130102\n10.1146/annurev.biophys.26.1.567"}

{"title": "Low-field mobility in an electrostatically confined 2D rectangular nanowire: effect of density of states and phonon confinement.", "abstract": "Transport in GaN-based nanoscale devices is of supreme importance for various applications. While the transport in bulk and two-dimensional (2D) structures is relatively well understood, understanding one-dimensional (1D) transport is still at its nascent stage. More importantly, the nanoscale structures may not operate at an explicit dimension of 2D and 1D. The understanding of the transport becomes limited on such an occasion. Here, we investigate the evolution of low-field mobility in GaN-based nanostructures for increasing quantum confinement in a uniform framework. We have used a split-gate architecture to change the degree of quantum confinement electrostatically. The low-field mobility is experimentally determined, which is then matched using scattering theory. It is shown that acoustic phonon, polar optical phonon, and scattering from piezoelectric fields dominate these devices. Contrary to intuition, the piezoelectric fields play the most determining role in low-field regimes. In addition, the evolving density of states and 2D phonon confinement, in addition to electron confinement, lead to a non-monotonic change in mobility. A decrease in the number of states near conduction band minima tends to increase mobility by reducing the number of final scattering states for the electrons. A larger overlap between confined electrons and phonons aggravates scattering and reduces mobility. These two competing effects can lead to many possible values for mobility during device operation.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2021-08-04", "authors": ["SreenadhSurapaneni", "JayaJha", "VikasPendem", "Yogendra KumarYadav", "SwaroopGanguly", "DipankarSaha"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ac1a3f"}

The major drawback of an imperfect interface in a system is its disability to transfer stress or potential across the surface effectively. Nondestructive evaluation, particularly P-wave reflection imaging, contributes significantly to detecting defects and in situ conditions of such structural components. The present study encapsulates the reflection/refraction phenomenon of quasi-pressure waves when they strike the mechanically/dieletrically/magnetically imperfect corrugated interfaces of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic half-spaces. The reflected/refracted wave fields not only consist of regular bulk and surface waves but also a spectrum of irregular bulk waves, arising as the result of geometrical irregularities at the interface. The reflection and refraction coefficients (RECs/RACs) of all regular/irregular waves are derived analytically by using Rayleigh's method of slope approximation (first iteration of small perturbation). The existence of the critical angle is interpreted from the slowness curves of the bulk waves. The influences of the corrugation, angular frequency, and interface imperfection on the RECs/RACs are the major findings reported in the study. The reflected/refracted potential waves diminish for the dielectrically/magnetically imperfect interface.

The secondary aim was to assess the level of adhesion of Streptococcus mutans on the root surface after instrumentation.\nThe groups consisted of the following: 1) Gracey curet; 2) piezoelectric scaler; 3) piezoelectric 11 Gracey curet tip; and 4) untreated control. Root specimens were obtained from extracted human teeth and randomly assigned to each group. Surface roughness measurements (Ra and Rz) were taken with a profilometer before and after instrumentation. After instrumentation, root specimens were inoculated with S. mutans and biofilm was dislodged. Various dilutions of resuspended biofilm were incubated on blood agar plates and colony forming units (CFU) values were measured.\nThe experimental device resulted in significantly lower Ra and Rz compared with other groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and the Gracey curet was significantly lower than the piezoelectric tip and untreated control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The Gracey curet and experimental device tip had significantly lower CFU values compared with the control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were no significant CFU value differences between the Gracey curet and both the piezoelectric and experimental device tips. There were no significant CFU differences between piezoelectric tip and both experimental device and control. There was no correlation between Ra and CFU values for Gracey curet, piezoelectric tip, or the control. However, correlation between Ra values and CFU approached significance for the experimental device (correlation\u00a0=\u00a00.66, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05).\nPiezoelectric 11 Gracey curet tip is effective at resulting in a significantly smoother surface compared with traditional piezoelectric and hand instruments.

A prototype of the totally implantable system composed of the ABM developed in previous research, an electronic module (EM) for the amplification of electrical output from the ABM, and electrode was developed. We investigated the feasibility of the ABM system and obtained meaningful auditory brainstem responses of deafened guinea pigs by implanting the electrode of the ABM system. Also, an optimal method of coupling the ABM system to the human ossicle for transducing sound waves into electrical signals using the middle ear vibration was studied and the electrical signal output according to the sound stimuli was measured successfully.

The primary outcome of interest was neurosensory recovery, as assessed using the functional sensory recovery (FSR) scale defined by the UK Medical Research Council.

This study establishes the physical model of the designed structure and the relationship between the steady-state working temperature and the physical properties of the material.

In order to improve their sensing performance, the Schottky barriers height (SBH) at the interface of semiconductor and metal electrode should be adjusted to appropriate range to avoid low output or low sensitivity, which was induced by excessively high or low SBH, respectively. In this work, a simple and effective SBH tuning method by triboelectric generator (TENG) is proposed, the SBH can be effectively lowered by voltage pulses generated by TENG and gradually recover over time after withdrawing the TENG. Through combining the TENG treatment with piezotronic effect, a synergistic effect on lowering SBH was achieved. The change of SBH is increased by 3.8 to 12.8 times, compared with dependent TENG treatment and piezotronic effect, respectively. Furthermore, the recovery time of the TENG-lowered SBH can be greatly shortened from 1.5\u00a0h to 40\u00a0s by piezotronic effect.

Herein, we report a highly active surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate fabricated by immobilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for continuous in situ SERS detection of pollutants in water and atmosphere. 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) was adopted as a probe molecule to evaluate the performance of the substrate, and the results indicate that the polymer-based flexible substrate features high sensitivity, uniformity, and repeatability. The fabricated PVDF/SERS substrate was integrated with a portable Raman spectrometer operating under both passing-by and passing-through modes.

{"title": "Enhanced out-of-plane electromechanical response of Janus ZrSeO.", "abstract": "Two-dimensional piezoelectric materials have attracted great attention as they could play a vital role in nano-electromagnetic systems. Herein, we investigate the compelling piezoelectric properties of Janus ZrSeO in monolayer and bulk structures using density functional theory calculations with a van der Waals correction. One of the two independent out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients (e31) of the bulk ZrSeO is as high as 287.60 pC m-1, which is over five times larger than that of monolayer ZrSeO due to charge changes in the internal structure within each Zr, Se, and O layer. Interestingly, another large negative out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient (e33) of bulk ZrSeO (-467.40 pC m-1) results from the displacement difference between the electronic and ionic center positions, which is at least three times larger than those previously reported for Janus Mo/W/Hf-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The charge transformation between atoms under strain induces negative piezoelectric stress, a process that is clarified using maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) and Bader charge analysis. This research also reveals the dependence of piezoelectricity in Janus MXY on the metal (M = Zr, Hf, W, Mo) and chalcogenide (X,Y = S, Se, O) components, which are directly proportional to the electronegativity and the atomic size difference.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2021-07-28", "authors": ["Thi HuePham", "HamidUllah", "AamirShafique", "Hye JungKim", "Young-HanShin"], "doi": "10.1039/d1cp00119a"}
{"title": "Identity of the local and macroscopic dynamic elastic responses in supercooled 1-propanol.", "abstract": "Glass-forming liquids are well known to have significant dynamic heterogeneities, leading to spatially grossly varying elastic properties throughout the system. In this paper, we compare the local elastic response of supercooled 1-propanol monitored by triplet state solvation dynamics to the macroscopic dynamic shear modulus measured by a piezo-electric gauge. The time-dependent responses are found to be identical, which means that the dynamic macroscopic shear modulus provides a good measure of the average local elastic properties. Since the macroscopic shear modulus of a dynamically inhomogeneous system in general is not just the average of the local moduli, there was no reason to expect such a result. This surprising finding not only provides constraints for models of dynamical heterogeneities in glass-forming liquids, but also allows for a fairly straightforward check on elastic models for glassy dynamics.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2021-07-28", "authors": ["PeterWeigl", "TinaHecksher", "Jeppe CDyre", "ThomasWalther", "ThomasBlochowicz"], "doi": "10.1039/d1cp02671b"}

{"title": "The impact of transfemoral socket adduction on pelvic and trunk stabilization during level walking - A biomechanical study.", "abstract": "It is common practice to align transfemoral prosthetic sockets in adduction, due to the physiologic, adducted femoral alignment in unimpaired legs. An adducted femoral and socket alignment helps tightening hip abductors to stabilize the pelvis and reduce pelvic and trunk related compensatory movements.\nHow do different socket adduction conditions (SAC) of transfemoral sockets affect pelvic and trunk stabilization during level ground walking in the frontal plane?\nSeven persons with transfemoral amputation with medium residual limb length participated in this study. The prosthetic alignment in the sagittal plane was performed according to established recommendations. SAC varied (0\u00b0, 3\u00b0, 6\u00b0, 9\u00b0). Kinematic and kinetic parameters were recorded in a gait laboratory with a 12-camera optoelectronic system and two piezoelectric force plates embedded in a 12-m walkway. The measurements were performed during level ground walking with self-selected comfortable gait speed.\nIn the frontal plane, nearly all investigated kinematic and kinetic parameters showed a strong correlation with the SAC. The pelvis was raised on the contralateral side throughout the gait cycle with increasing SAC. During the prosthetic side stance phase, the mean shoulder obliquity and mean lateral trunk lean to the prosthetic side tended to be reduced with increased SAC. Prosthetic side hip abduction moment decreased with increasing SAC.\nThe results confirm that transfemoral SAC contributes to pelvic stabilization and reduced compensatory movements of the pelvis and trunk. Transfemoral SAC of 6 \u00b1 1\u00b0 for bench alignment seems adequate for amputees with medium residual limb length.

{"title": "Precipitation Hardening in Ferroelectric Ceramics.", "abstract": "Domain wall motion in ferroics, similar to dislocation motion in metals, can be tuned by well-concepted microstructural elements. In demanding high-power applications of piezoelectric materials, the domain wall motion is considered as a lossy hysteretic mechanism that should be restricted. Current applications for so-called hard piezoelectrics are abundant and hinge on the use of an acceptor-doping scheme. However, this mechanism features severe limitations due to enhanced mobility of oxygen vacancies at moderate temperatures. By analogy with metal technology, the authors present here a new solution for electroceramics, where precipitates are utilized to pin domain walls and improve piezoelectric properties. Through a sequence of sintering, nucleation, and precipitate growth, intragranular precipitates leading to a fine domain structure are developed as shown by transmission electron microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, and phase-field simulation. This structure impedes the domain wall motion as elucidated by electromechanical characterization. As a result, the mechanical quality factor is increased by \u224850% and the hysteresis in electrostrain is suppressed considerably. This is even achieved with slightly increased piezoelectric coefficient and electromechanical coupling factor.

{"title": "Mechanical Energy Sensing and Harvesting in Micromachined Polymer-Based Piezoelectric Transducers for Fully Implanted Hearing Systems: A Review.", "abstract": "The paper presents a comprehensive review of mechanical energy harvesters and microphone sensors for totally implanted hearing systems. The studies on hearing mechanisms, hearing losses and hearing solutions are first introduced to bring to light the necessity of creating and integrating the in vivo energy harvester and implantable microphone into a single chip. The in vivo energy harvester can continuously harness energy from the biomechanical motion of the internal organs. The implantable microphone executes mechanoelectrical transduction, and an array of such structures can filter sound frequency directly without an analogue-to-digital converter. The revision of the available transduction mechanisms, device configuration structures and piezoelectric material characteristics reveals the advantage of adopting the polymer-based piezoelectric transducers. A dual function of sensing the sound signal and simultaneously harvesting vibration energy to power up its system can be attained from a single transducer. Advanced process technology incorporates polymers into piezoelectric materials, initiating the invention of a self-powered and flexible transducer that is compatible with the human body, magnetic resonance imaging system (MRI) and the standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes. The polymer-based piezoelectric is a promising material that satisfies many of the requirements for obtaining high performance implantable microphones and in vivo piezoelectric energy harvesters.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-07-25", "authors": ["RhoniraLatif", "Mimiwaty MohdNoor", "JumrilYunas", "Azrul AzlanHamzah"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13142276\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.05.021\n10.1109/RBME.2008.2008250\n10.20471/acc.2019.58.02.20\n10.3390/s18061694\n10.1177/1084713809346262\n10.1038/s41598-020-58512-7\n10.5606/kbbihtisas.2014.45143\n10.1007/s00405-019-05769-y\n10.1179/146701010X12671177989831\n10.1016/j.joto.2015.10.001\n10.1159/000318516\n10.1016/j.otc.2014.08.006\n10.1016/j.heares.2013.02.003\n10.1002/lio2.495\n10.1186/s12938-018-0454-z\n10.1016/B978-0-12-805398-0.00010-4\n10.3390/en13112837\n10.3390/signals1020012\n10.1002/adhm.202000790\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105567\n10.4103/2321-4848.123049\n10.1109/20.800598\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.052\n10.1126/science.1139366\n10.1097/MAO.0b013e31814b242f\n10.1088/1742-6596/660/1/012121\n10.1063/1.4942882\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104085\n10.1002/adfm.201700341\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.12.038\n10.1088/0022-3727/40/18/042\n10.1039/C5EE01593F\n10.1007/s12206-019-0749-4\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.04.018\n10.1038/nbt.2394\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.3390/proceedings1040584\n10.1109/rsm.2013.6706556\n10.7567/JJAP.50.09ND16\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.020\n10.1109/ipact.2017.8245043\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105076\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.012\n10.3390/s18061797\n10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2020.105314\n10.1016/j.tsf.2018.08.043\n10.1117/12.484443\n10.1073/pnas.1110036108\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.090\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.05.044\n10.1063/1.3176019\n10.1063/1.4968609\n10.1063/1.4890385\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.03.013\n10.1002/adfm.201402270\n10.1073/pnas.1317233111\n10.1002/adma.201400562\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(2000)53:2<181::AID-JBM8>3.0.CO;2-T\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1981.tb09549.x\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1982.tb09953.x\n10.1159/000090682\n10.1186/s11671-018-2593-3\n10.1007/s00542-016-2937-9\n10.1002/adhm.201600232\n10.1016/S0030-6665(05)70343-1\n10.1049/el.2013.1350\n10.1007/s00542-018-4003-2\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2195782\n10.1021/acsami.0c09238\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.08.017\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/9/095018\n10.1038/srep12447\n10.1007/s13391-018-0012-7\n10.1038/s41598-018-22219-7\n10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2216505\n10.1038/s41598-019-39303-1\n10.3390/s140100117\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.12.021\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2355822"}

It is thus important to analyze the electromechanical coupling properties of piezoelectric semiconductor nanoplates. We established a nanoplate model for the piezoelectric semiconductor plate structure by extending the first-order shear deformation theory. The flexural vibrations of nanoplates subjected to a transversely time-harmonic force were investigated. The vibrational modes and natural frequencies were obtained by using the matrix eigenvalue solver in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a, and the convergence analysis was carried out to guarantee accurate results. In numerical cases, the tuning effect of the initial electron concentration on mechanics and electric properties is deeply discussed. The numerical results show that the initial electron concentration greatly affects the natural frequency and electromechanical fields of piezoelectric semiconductors, and a high initial electron concentration can reduce the electromechanical fields and the stiffness of piezoelectric semiconductors due to the electron screening effect.

{"title": "Experimental and Analytical Study of under Water Pressure Wave Induced by the Implosion of a Bubble Generated by Focused Laser.", "abstract": "In various domains of material processing, such as surface cleaning and surface treatment, cavitation phenomenon may become an alternative to traditional methods if this phenomenon is well understood. Due to experimental and mathematical difficulties in theoretical models, it is still a challenge to accurately measure the physical mechanism of the fluid/structure interactions. In this study, we verified the feasibility of using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensors to quantitatively measure the under-water pressure wave generated by the collapse of a single cavitation bubble. The electrical signal obtained by PVDF can be converted into pressure information only by using the sensor material parameters provided by the supplier. During the conversion process, only the capacitance of the acquisition chain needs to be additionally measured. At the same time, a high-speed video recording system was used to visualize the evolution of the cavitation bubble. The Gilmore analytical model and an associated wave propagation model were used to simulate the pressure peak of the first collapse of the cavitation bubble. This theoretical pressure was compared with the experimental results. The result showed that, for bubbles with a normalized standoff distance \u03b3 larger than 5, the PVDF sensor had the ability to quantitatively measure the pressure wave generated by a single cavitation bubble.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-25", "authors": ["ZhaofengHan", "CyrilMauger", "ThibautChaise", "ThomasElguedj", "MichelArrigoni", "MahmoudEl Hajem", "NicolasBoisson"], "doi": "10.3390/s21144800\n10.1115/1.4004088\n10.1071/EG998280\n10.1243/PIME_PROC_1959_173_054_02\n10.1115/1.3448452\n10.1016/j.fuel.2004.10.009\n10.4995/ILASS2017.2017.4938\n10.1007/s00348-019-2780-8\n10.1056/NEJMoa041175\n10.1161/01.STR.0000199064.94588.39\n10.1056/NEJM198802183180701\n10.1016/S0301-5629(02)00506-9\n10.1089/089277903769013568\n10.3109/02656736.2015.1007538\n10.1089/104303403764539369\n10.1529/biophysj.105.075366\n10.1017/S0022112006002746\n10.1016/j.addr.2013.11.008\n10.1097/00000539-200010000-00007\n10.1148/radiol.2202001804\n10.1063/1.2337506\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2015.06.017\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2015.04.026\n10.1115/1.538911\n10.3390/app10207280\n10.1146/annurev.fluid.34.082301.114957\n10.1115/1.1447926\n10.3390/met11040531\n10.1063/5.0045705\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2018.07.023\n10.1115/1.4009975\n10.1016/S1350-4177(97)00009-6\n10.1098/rsta.1999.0327\n10.1063/1.1401810\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2007.05.003\n10.1063/1.4931098\n10.1017/S0022112075003448\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2013.01.010\n10.1039/c3sm52697f\n10.1063/1.4935875\n10.1063/1.5026713\n10.1016/0370-1573(80)90115-5\n10.1063/1.3046735\n10.1007/s00348-013-1503-9\n10.1017/S0022112060000311\n10.1299/jsme1958.21.223\n10.1103/PhysRevE.59.1777\n10.1063/1.5119794\n10.1243/03093247JSA584\n10.1109/JSEN.2006.881407\n10.1080/14786440808635681\n10.1017/S0022112090001860\n10.1121/1.384720\n10.1007/s41314-018-0012-2\n10.1063/1.370553\n10.1007/978-90-481-8831-4_14\n10.1063/1.4793193\n10.1063/1.3066176\n10.1364/AO.9.001854\n10.1017/S0022112098008738"}

Furthermore, the mechanical and electrical properties of PMN-PT- and PZT-based devices were measured and compared. The PMN-PT-based devices showed a higher Young's modulus and lower damping ratio. Owing to their higher figure of merit and lower piezoelectric voltage constant, they showed a higher power and lower voltage than the PZT-based devices.

Ultrasonic Stokes drag force generated using a planar piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer in a remotely controllable way is introduced. When ultrasonic Stokes drag force is applied on lipid vesicles, the lipid nanotubules attached can be dragged out from the lipid film. In order to demonstrate the formation mechanism of the lipid nanotubules produced by ultrasonic drag force clearly, a theoretical kinetic model is developed. In the experiments, the lipid nanotubules can be rapidly and efficiently fabricated using this ultrasonic transducer both in deionized water and NaCl solutions with different concentrations. The stretching speed of the lipid nanotubules can reach 33 \u03bcm/s, approximately 10 times faster than that of the existing methods. The formed lipid nanotubules have a diameter of 600 \u00b1 100 nm (>80%). The length can reach the millimeter level.

In common FCs, a polymer electrolyte membrane selectively conducts protons but blocks the passage of electrons and fuel. Nafion, the current benchmark membrane material, has a superior conductivity owing to unique morphology comprising randomly oriented elongated ionic nanochannels within its Teflon-like matrix. Channel orientation enhances Nafion conductivity, yet there has been no facile method to induce a stable alignment in the desired through-plane (TP) direction. Here, we report an approach based on dual electrospun Nafion-PVDF nanofiber composites that yields a stable TP alignment. It utilizes extreme thinness and strong inherent orientation within electrospun nanofibers, which is readily converted to TP alignment by plunging an electrospun nanofiber mat into a thin slit, resulting in nanofiber buckling and subsequent consolidation. Using TEM and SAXS, we demonstrate a pronounced and sustained TP ion channel orientation in prepared membranes, yielding a highly anisotropic swelling and conductivity exceeding that of bulk Nafion when normalized to Nafion content. The analysis also highlights the importance of PVDF as a stabilizing component, preserving orientation upon annealing, while a similarly prepared pure Nafion membrane loses anisotropy.

The limitations of spatial resolution due to bandwidth are of great concern in ultrasound medical imaging. The method of acoustic impedance matching between the piezoelectric element and medium is commonly used to obtain broad bandwidth and high resolution. In this study, an optimized backing layer design was proposed to broaden the bandwidth by adding a tunable acoustic impedance matching layer of backing (AIMLB) between the backing layer and the piezoelectric ceramic element. The Mason equivalent circuit method was used to analyze the effect of the backing material composition and its structure on the bandwidth of the transducer. The optimized transducer was simulated using the finite-element method with the PZFlex software. Based on the PZFlex simulations, a 20-MHz ultrasonic transducer using the AIMLB with a bandwidth of approximately 92.29% was fabricated. The experimental results were in good agreement with the simulations.

This paper presents a new strategy to estimate very short relative distances with high accuracy based on the use of multi-frequency pulsed waves (MFPW). The proposed strategy allows to avoid the multipath reflections that appear when continuous waves are used, and it improves the achieved accuracy compared to the original MFCW method. To validate it, an 80 \u00b5m square AlScN piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) was chosen as a transmitter while a hydrophone was utilized as a target and receiver, immersed in fluorinert (FC-70) as a propagation medium. Three independent and consecutive tone-burst signals were transmitted successively. The selected frequencies are f1 = 2.3962 MHz, f2 = 2.327 MHz and f3 = 2.1195 MHz, giving first and second-order resolutions of 6.88 and 0.79 \u00b5m/\u00b0, respectively. Experimental results show a \u00b16.2 \u03bcm measured range error in a range of 3.5 mm, and therefore it represents a good candidate for ultrasound micro-profilometer applications under liquid operation.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-21", "authors": ["Iv\u00e1nZamora", "EyglisLedesma", "ArantxaUranga", "N\u00fariaBarniol"], "doi": "10.3390/s21134524\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2364975\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2831638\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2157490\n10.1016/j.measurement.2014.10.017\n10.3390/app9071483\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2930661\n10.1109/TIM.2007.913761\n10.1016/S0301-5629(02)00784-6\n10.1109/LSSC.2020.3018791\n10.1109/TCSI.2021.3049246\n10.1109/JMEMS.2019.2912869\n10.1109/TIM.2012.2203871\n10.1063/1.1149604\n10.1109/4.890317\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2995643\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3013763\n10.1109/19.310171"}

Here we show the self-propulsion of droplets that furcated in well-defined directions on piezoelectric single crystals in the absence of any apparent asymmetry or external force. By selecting the crystal plane to interface with the droplets, the thermoelastic-piezoelectric interplay yields intricate electric potential profiles, enabling various forms of self-propulsion including unidirectional, bifurcated and trifurcated. This effect originates from an anisotropic crystalline structure that generates contrasting macroscopic liquid behaviours and is observed with cold/hot and volatile droplets.

{"title": "Recent advances of polymer-based piezoelectric composites for biomedical applications.", "abstract": "Over the past decades, electronics have become central to many aspects of biomedicine and wearable device technologies as a promising personalized healthcare platform. Lead-free piezoelectric materials for converting mechanical into electrical energy through piezoelectric transduction are of significant value in a diverse range of technological applications. Organic piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted widespread attention as the functional materials in the biomedical devices due to their advantages of excellent biocompatibility. They include synthetic and biological polymers. Many biopolymers have been discovered to possess piezoelectricity in an appreciable amount, however their investigation is still preliminary. Due to their piezoelectric properties, better known synthetic fluorinated polymers have been intensively investigated and applied in biomedical applications including controlled drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, microfluidic and artificial muscle actuators, among others. Piezoelectric polymers, especially poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers are increasingly receiving interest as smart biomaterials due to their ability to convert physiological movements to electrical signals when in a controllable and reproducible manner. Despite possessing the greatest piezoelectric coefficients among all piezoelectric polymers, it is often desirable to increase the electrical outputs. The most promising routes toward significant improvements in the piezoelectric response and energy-harvesting performance of such materials is loading them with various inorganic nanofillers and/or applying some modification during the fabrication process. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the principles, properties, and applications of organic piezoelectric biomaterials (polymers and polymer/ceramic composites) with special attention on PVDF-based polymers and their composites in sensors, drug delivery and tissue engineering. Subsequently focuses on the most common fabrication routes to produce piezoelectric scaffolds, tissue and sensors which is electrospinning process.

{"title": "Optimizing the placement of piezoelectric wafers on closed sections using a genetic algorithm - Towards application in structural health monitoring.", "abstract": "Sensor network design is essential to efficiently integrate Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems in aerospace, automotive, and civil structures. This study describes an optimization model for piezoelectric (PZT) wafer placement on curved structures and closed sections. The proposed approach relied on the transformation of any complex/closed surface regardless of the shape of its cross-section into a flat plate and imposed a set of boundary conditions to account for the wave propagation characteristics. Because the structure was continuous and the wave could propagate in every direction, for simplicity and without sacrificing accuracy, our model assumed that a pair of PZT elements communicated information in the two shortest directions. Thus, the concept of having two paths for each PZT couple was introduced to tackle this multidirectional behavior. The plate was then discretized into a set of control points that represented the structure geometry. The PZT couples covered the control points along the line of sight and in the neighborhood of their direct and indirect paths. The objective function was to maximize the number of covered points while minimizing the number of PZT wafers. The proposed model was solved using a genetic algorithm and was validated on circular and square sections. Sensors were spread on the circumference of the structure rather than mounting them in the form of rings or axial lines. The optimized PZT networks had high coverage that reached 99% in simulations. Notably, the optimized model improved the preliminary solution coverage by 14%. Experimental validation was performed on the circular section (pipe). The results demonstrated the proficiency of the developed model in distributing the PZT wafers on closed sections. The coverage was further evaluated by assessing if damaged areas on the pipe surface could be identified. Artificial damage was accurately located within 18\u00a0mm from the actual location. These results demonstrate that our model efficiently distributes PZT wafers on closed structures.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-07-20", "authors": ["ZainabIsmail", "SamirMustapha", "HusseinTarhini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106523"}

Acoustic power transfer (APT) is an excellent option to supply these sensors without making through holes. However, the power transfer performances of APT systems can be strongly degraded by the destructive interferences of emitted waves, typically when the receiver diameter is smaller than the transmitter's one. In this paper, the use of multiple transmitters to focalize acoustic waves on a receiver is analyzed and the equations determining the optimal magnitudes and phases of the input voltages are presented. We experimentally validate that the efficiency and the transmitted power are strongly improved with the proposed technique. The transmitted power and the efficiency are multiplied by two for aligned transducers while the transmitted power is multiplied by up to 45 for misaligned transducers. It is hence demonstrated that using multiple emitters is particularly well suited for industrial applications where high power and high robustness are needed. Moreover, it paves the way toward the power supply of non-aligned distributed sensor nodes, which are of particular interest in structural health monitoring.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-07-19", "authors": ["OFreychet", "FFrassati", "SBoisseau", "SBrulais", "GDespesse"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106524"}

For most piezoelectric materials, their acoustic impedances are significantly higher than human tissues and organs, so a tunable matching layer with a high acoustic impedance is required for optimizing the acoustic wave transmission. In this article, a high compression fabrication method is presented, with which the acoustic impedance of alumina-epoxy composite matching layer can be tuned from 6.50 to 9.47 MRayl by controlling the applied compression pressure and ratio of the components. The maximum acoustic impedance 9.47 MRayl can be achieved by compressing a mixture of 80% alumina weight ratio under a 62.4\u00a0MPa pressure. This enhancement mainly relies on the increased acoustic longitudinal velocity which enlarged the tolerance of high to ultra-high frequency transducer fabrication using quarter wavelength matching design. Furthermore, the attenuation of the matching layer developed by this method is only -10\u00a0dB/mm at 40\u00a0MHz.

Compared to the membrane in the dark condition, the pGAM membrane displayed an enhanced dye removal efficiency (\u223c99.7%) and significantly improved permeability (\u223c189 L\u00b7m", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2021-07-18", "authors": ["RengyuYue", "BaharehRaisi", "JalalRahmatinejad", "ZhibinYe", "BenoitBarbeau", "Md SaifurRahaman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.157"}
{"title": "Anisotropic distortion in the perceived orientation of stimuli on the arm.", "abstract": "Mechanoreceptors on the skin are heterogeneously distributed, and the sampling of neural signals in the brain can vary depending on the part of the body. Therefore, it can be challenging for the brain to consistently represent stimuli applied to different body sites. Here, we report an example of a regional perceptual distortion of the tactile space. We used a piezoelectric braille display to examine shape perception on the volar surface of the arm and to compare it to that on the palm. We found that the orientation of perceived stimuli on the arm was distorted in certain areas. In particular, an inwardly-inclined line shape was perceived as being more inwardly-inclined than it actually was. On the other hand, an outwardly-inclined line was perceived accurately. When the same stimuli were applied to the palm, this anisotropic bias was not observed. We also found that changing the posture of the arm changed the angle at which this anisotropic distortion occurred, suggesting the influence of the skin frame of reference on this illusion. This study showed a clear example of how the representation of even simple stimuli is complexly distinct when the stimuli are applied to different body sites.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-07-18", "authors": ["ScinobKuroki"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-93959-2\n10.1068/p2873\n10.3758/BF03194834\n10.3758/BF03202654\n10.1037/xhp0000434\n10.1037/a0021921\n10.1016/j.concog.2015.12.008\n10.1037/h0037137\n10.1073/pnas.1715123115\n10.3389/fnhum.2018.00055\n10.1016/j.neulet.2007.12.054\n10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00484-X\n10.1016/j.brainres.2004.03.009\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.1983.tb07337.x\n10.1038/s41598-020-74835-x\n10.3758/BF03212124\n10.1109/TOH.2018.2861010\n10.1007/s00221-019-05564-5\n10.1097/00003446-199508000-00006\n10.1109/TOH.2020.3042955\n10.1007/s00221-006-0377-y\n10.3758/BF03211925\n10.1016/S0001-6918(01)00047-6\n10.1016/S0001-6918(03)00063-5\n10.1016/j.actpsy.2004.08.002\n10.1068/p2930\n10.3758/BF03208283\n10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01178-8\n10.1007/s00221-002-1365-5\n10.1068/p140763\n10.1016/S0304-3940(01)01805-5\n10.3758/s13428-012-0186-0\n10.1177/20416695211004620\n10.1080/01621459.1986.10478341"}

The investigators designed a retrospective study on all TMJA patients treated with different treatment modalities from 2013 to 2019. The investigators observed that complete removal of the ankylotic mass particularly on the medial side; use of a piezoelectric scalpel for a clean and smooth osteotomy with copious irrigation to remove bone chips and slurry; less trauma to the local tissue; osteotomy design parallel and inferior osteotomy at the narrowest part, which mostly corresponds to the condylar neck; performance of a coronoidectomy (if mouth opening is <30mm), fat interposition; no intraoperative correction of any pre-existing chin deviation when treated with costochondral graft; patient motivation; and aggressive physiotherapy, and use of a vacuum drain are all important to prevent re-ankylosis, irrespective of the treatment modality. A total of 114 patients (n=152 joints), [bilateral (n=38), unilateral (n=76)] were evaluated retrospectively. Interpositional arthroplasty with fat was performed in n=43, CCG was used for reconstruction in n=30 and total joint replacement (TJR) was done in n=41 patients. Re-ankylosis was seen in n=3 (2.6%) patients (2 in CCG and 1 patient in interpositional arthroplasty). The follow-up ranged from 12-80 months.

{"title": "Brain-mimicking phantom for biomechanical validation of motion sensitive MR imaging techniques.", "abstract": "Motion sensitive MR imaging techniques allow for the non-invasive evaluation of biological tissues by using different excitation schemes, including physiological/intrinsic motions caused by cardiac pulsation or respiration, and vibrations caused by an external actuator. The mechanical biomarkers extracted through these imaging techniques have been shown to hold diagnostic value for various neurological disorders and conditions. Amplified MRI (aMRI), a cardiac gated imaging technique, can help track and quantify low frequency intrinsic motion of the brain. As for high frequency actuation, the mechanical response of brain tissue can be measured by applying external high frequency actuation in combination with a motion sensitive MR imaging sequence called Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). Due to the frequency-dependent behavior of brain mechanics, there is a need to develop brain phantom models that can mimic the broadband mechanical response of the brain in order to validate motion-sensitive MR imaging techniques. Here, we have designed a novel phantom test setup that enables both the low and high frequency responses of a brain-mimicking phantom to be captured, allowing for both aMRI and MRE imaging techniques to be applied on the same phantom model. This setup combines two different vibration sources: a pneumatic actuator, for low frequency/intrinsic motion (1 Hz) for use in aMRI, and a piezoelectric actuator for high frequency actuation (30-60 Hz) for use in MRE. Our results show that in MRE experiments performed from 30 Hz through 60 Hz, propagating shear waves attenuate faster at higher driving frequencies, consistent with results in the literature. Furthermore, actuator coupling has a substantial effect on wave amplitude, with weaker coupling causing lower amplitude wave field images, specifically shown in the top-surface shear loading configuration. For intrinsic actuation, our results indicate that aMRI linearly amplifies motion up to at least an amplification factor of 9 for instances of both visible and sub-voxel motion, validated by varying power levels of pneumatic actuation (40%-80% power) under MR, and through video analysis outside the MRI scanner room.

{"title": "All-Organic Flexible Ferroelectret Nanogenerator with Fabric-Based Electrodes for Self-Powered Body Area Networks.", "abstract": "Due to their electrically polarized air-filled internal pores, optimized ferroelectrets exhibit a remarkable piezoelectric response, making them suitable for energy harvesting. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) ferroelectret films are laminated with two fluorinated-ethylene-propylene (FEP) copolymer films and internally polarized by corona discharge. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-coated spandex fabric is employed for the electrodes to assemble an all-organic ferroelectret nanogenerator (FENG). The outer electret-plus-electrode double layers form active device layers with deformable electric dipoles that strongly contribute to the overall piezoelectric response in the proposed concept of wearable nanogenerators. Thus, the FENG with spandex electrodes generates a short-circuit current which is twice as high as that with aluminum electrodes. The stacking sequence spandex/FEP/ePTFE/FEP/ePTFE/FEP/spandex with an average pore size of 3\u00a0\u00b5m in the ePTFE films yields the best overall performance, which is also demonstrated by the displacement-versus-electric-field loop results. The all-organic FENGs are stable up to 90\u00a0\u00b0C and still perform well 9 months after being polarized. An optimized FENG makes three light emitting diodes (LEDs) blink twice with the energy generated during a single footstep.

A prospective study using (1) a solid bite registration index during preoperative computed tomography, (2) critical planning with regard to the condylar rotation, (3) a piezoelectric saw throughout the mandibular osteotomy, and (4) intraoperative navigation to determine the position of the PSIs and the mandibular segments intraoperatively was performed. Ten patients were treated. Five underwent bilateral sagittal split osteotomies and 5 bimaxillary osteotomy. All of the PSIs fitted precisely onto the mandible and the screws into the predrilled screw holes. The predetermined occlusion was obtained. A precise fitting of the PSIs in the lower jaw seems to be possible to achieve with above-mentioned methods.

Both molecules are found to chemisorb at the S vacancy (SV) and pristine Mo edge and physisorb at the Mo edge with a 50% sulfur coverage (Mo-50 edge). Among them, SO2 has larger adsorption energy than H2S on both S vacancy and pristine Mo edge, which is related to a more electronegative O than S atom and electronically rich for the pristine Mo edge. The defective states of MoS2 induced by SV can be removed by forming Mo-S, Mo-O and Mo-H bonds upon the adsorption of SO2 and the dissociation of H2S, which is applicable in designing MoS2 based nano-electronics devices in the future. The dissociations of H2S and SO2 on pristine Mo edges are found to be more favorable than those on S vacancies due to the catalytically active Mo4+ states at edge sites.

In the present study, oocytes and spermatozoa were collected from live squirrel monkeys, following which piezo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was performed using these gametes. Follicular development was induced by administering equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) containing inhibin antiserum to an immature squirrel monkey female. The unilateral ovary was excised after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), to induce ovulation, following which the larger developed follicular oocytes were collected. Follicular oocytes were prepared for ICSI using sperm from the epididymal tail of a unilateral testis extracted from a mature male. The embryos were continuously incubated in CMRL 1066 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Embryo culture was performed with cumulus cells. Two experiments of ICSI carried out with three females resulted in 14 mature oocytes from the 49 cumulus-oocyte complexes collected and five embryos, three of which developed into blastocysts. These blastocysts were vitrified, thawed, and transferred to recipient monkeys, but no pregnancies resulted.

We discuss two functionalization approaches to independently sensitize the interface of different cantilevers. A custom piezo-stack actuator and optical readout system enable the measurement of resonance frequencies up to 2\u00a0MHz. We implement a new measurement strategy based on a phase-locked loop (PLL), built via in-house developed software. The PLL allows us to track, within the same experiment, the evolution of resonance frequency over time of up to four modes for all the cantilevers in the array. With respect to the previous measurement technique, based on standard frequency sweep, the PLL enhances the estimated detection limit of the device by a factor of 7 (down to 2\u00a0pg in 5\u00a0min integration time) and the time resolution by more than threefold (below 15\u00a0s), being on par with commercial gold-standard techniques.

By combining multiple probe signals, the contact can be successfully localized.

{"title": "Homogenization of periodic 1-3 piezocomposite using wave propagation: Toward an experimental method.", "abstract": "1-3 piezocomposites are first choice materials for integration in ultrasonic transducers due to their high electromechanical performance, particularly, in their thickness mode. The determination of a complete set of effective electroelastic parameters through a homogenization scheme is of primary importance for their consideration as homogeneous. This allows for the simplification of the transducer design using numerical methods. The method proposed is based on acoustic wave propagation through an infinite piezocomposite, which is considered to be homogeneous material. Christoffel tensor components for the 2\u2009mm symmetry were expressed to deduce slowness curves in several planes. Simultaneously, slowness curves of a numerical phantom were obtained using a finite element method (FEM). Dispersive curves were initially calculated in the corresponding heterogeneous structure. The subsequent identification of the effective parameters was based on a fitting process between the two sets of slowness curves. Then, homogenized coefficients were compared with reference results from a numerical method based on a fast Fourier transform for heterogeneous periodic piezoelectric materials in the quasi-static regime. A relative error of less than 2% for a very large majority of effective coefficients was obtained. As the aim of this paper is to implement an experimental procedure based on the proposed homogenization scheme to determine the effective parameters of the material in operating conditions, it is shown that simplifications to the procedure can be performed and a careful selection of only seven slowness directions is sufficient to obtain the complete database for a piezocomposite containing square-shaped fibers. Finally, further considerations to adapt the present work to a 1-3 piezocomposite with a fixed thickness are also presented.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2021-07-10", "authors": ["AntoineBal\u00e9", "R\u00e9miRouffaud", "FranckLevassort", "RenaldBrenner", "Anne-ChristineHladky-Hennion"], "doi": "10.1121/10.0004824"}

The determination of the responsivity of a traditional immersion or contact piezoelectric transducer has been well investigated. However, due to the high attenuation of waves propagating in air and the large acoustic impedance mismatch between the active piezoceramic material and the load medium, there are few reports of the calibration of an air-coupled piezoelectric transducer. In this work, we present a comparative method of measuring the responsivity of an air-coupled transducer: the air-coupled transducer is used to receive a broadband pulse signal to evaluate its frequency spectrum, and a toneburst signal with known vibration displacement is measured by the air-coupled transducer in order to calibrate the amplitude of the responsivity. The effects of transmitter responsivity, input pulse characteristics, attenuation, and diffraction are taken into account to improve the accuracy of the responsivity determination. In addition, the measurement of the amplitude of the responsivity by comparing the measured displacements avoids the complicated task of characterizing the effects of electrical equipment. The determined responsivity is checked by comparing the measured displacements using different methods at different frequencies in order to evaluate its frequency spectrum and by measuring the nonlinearity parameters of the material to evaluate its amplitude. The agreement between results obtained using different methods demonstrates that the calibrated responsivity of the air-coupled transducer is valid, and the proposed method is effective.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-07-06", "authors": ["XiongbingLi", "ZhaojieDai", "GuangdongZhang", "ShuzengZhang", "HyunjoJeong"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3084756"}

To develop patient-specific in vitro neural models, a functional material-based technology that offers multi-potent stimuli for enhanced neural tissue development is devised. An electrospun piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) nanofibrous scaffold is systematically optimized to maximize its piezoelectric properties while accommodating the cellular behaviors of neural stem cells. Hydro-acoustic actuation is elegantly utilized to remotely activate the piezoelectric effect of P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds in a physiologically-safe manner for the generation of cell-relevant electric potentials. This mechano-electrical stimulation, which arose from the deflection of the scaffold and its consequent generation of electric charges on the scaffold surface under hydro-acoustic actuation, induces the multi-phenotypic differentiation of neural stem cells simultaneously toward neuronal, oligodendrocytic, and astrocytic phenotypes. As compared to the traditional biochemically-mediated differentiation, the 3D neuron-glial interface induced by the mechano-electrical stimulation results in enhanced interactions among cellular components, leading to superior neural connectivity and functionality.

Therefore, a quasi-axisymmetric wave is formed due to many undesired wave modes are launched instead of a pure axisymmetric wave at a given excitation frequency. In this paper, a realistic superposition model of axial multiple transducer arrays is proposed. The model has many potential applications; one example is investigating the source influence on the generated quasi-axisymmetric wave effect. The analytical model is employed to achieve the predictions for investigating a transmitter's influence for the unidirectional enhancement of torsional T(0,1) guided wave mode excitation in a pipe inspection system composing of three piezoelectric transducer ring arrays.

A further step towards such applications is to prepare thin films with the required properties. Here, the investigation is focused on the characterization of films of guanine and cytosine nucleobases, prepared by thermal evaporation-an industrial accessible deposition technique. The cytosine films have an orthorhombic non-centrosymmetric structure and grow in two interconnected nanostructured fractal patterns, of nearly equal proportion. Piezoresponse force microscopy images acquired at room temperature on the cytosine films display large zones with antiparallel alignment of the vertical components of the polarization vector. Guanine films have a dense nano-grained morphology. Our studies reveal electrical polarization switching effects which can be related to ferroelectricity in the films of guanine molecules. Characteristic ferroelectric polarization-electric-field hysteresis loops showing large electrical polarization are observed at low temperatures up to 200 K. Above this temperature, the guanine films have a preponderant paraelectric phase containing residual or locally induced nano-scopic ferroelectric domains, as observed by piezoresponse force microscopy at room temperature.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["MarcelaSocol", "LucianTrupina", "Aurelian-CatalinGalca", "CristinaChirila", "George EStan", "Aurel-MihaiVlaicu", "Anda ElenaStanciu", "Andra GeorgiaBoni", "MihaelaBotea", "AncaStanculescu", "LucianPintilie", "BogdanaBorca"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ac10e4"}

Among membrane-based separation approaches as established methods in the water treatment industry, polymers attracted massive attention in the production of membranes due to their low cost and high-performance filtration of pollutants. However, hydrophobicity and low speed of filtration along with limited decontamination performance against some of the dyes, demand new approaches and membranes to overcome drawbacks points.

{"title": "[Determination of seven phenoxy acid herbicides in water by dispersive solid phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based on cationic metal-organic framework mixed matrix membrane].", "abstract": "Phenoxy acid herbicides are widely used because of their excellent efficiency and low cost. However, owing to their strong polarity and water solubility, these herbicides do not degrade easily in a water environment and persist for a long time in water bodies. These herbicides readily enter water bodies via surface runoff, infiltration, and other migration routes, thus affecting water quality safety. Therefore, it is of great significance to establish a sensitive and simple method for the quantitative analysis of phenoxy acid herbicides in environmental water. Given the low concentration of such contaminants in environmental water, appropriate detection methods are important. Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) has high sensitivity and accuracy, thus being well suited for the phenoxy acid herbicides analysis. Sample preparation techniques are also important for the extraction and enrichment of contaminants in environmental water. Dispersive solid phase extraction (DSPE) has attracted considerable attention owing to its low cost, ease of operation, and low solvent consumption. In general, the selectivity and efficiency of solid phase extraction are largely dependent on the characteristics of the solid adsorbent materials. Ionic metal-organic frameworks (iMOFs) have excellent ion-exchange properties and show selective absorptivity to ionic compounds.

{"title": "Flexible Ultrasonic Patch for Accelerating Chronic Wound Healing.", "abstract": "Ultrasound treatment is an effective method for accelerating chronic wound healing. However, it is not widely used because traditional ultrasonic probes cannot be conformal to the wound surface, which leads to limitations of use and unstable treatment effects. In addition, the use of liquid coupling agent increases the chance of wound infection. A strategy is proposed to design and fabricate a flexible ultrasonic patch for treating chronic wounds effectively. The piezoelectric ceramic in the patch is discretized into several linearly arranged units, which are integrated on a flexible circuit substrate. A thin hydrogel patch is used as both encapsulation and coupling layer to avoid wound infection and ensure the penetration of ultrasound. The ultrasonic patch is soft, light, and can completely conform to the treatment area. Bending of the patch focuses the sound beams on the center of the bending circle, which achieves control of the target treatment area. Ultrasound treatment experiments are carried out on some type-II diabetic rats. Immunohistochemical (IHC) results indicate that ultrasound accelerates wound healing by activating Rac1 in both dermal and epidermal layers. Treatment results show that wound treated with the ultrasound heals faster than wounds without.

Particularly considering their biocompatibility and biosafety for applications regarding implantable medical detection, this paper proposed a new concept of piezoelectric composite, i.e., one consisting of vertically aligned ZnO NW arrays and an insulating polymer matrix. First, the finite element method (FEM) was employed to drive optimization strategies through adjustment of the key parameters such as Young's modules and the dielectric constant of the dielectric constituents, together with the density and dimension of nanowire (NW) itself. Second, to investigate the functionality of each individual layer of composite, different designed structures were fabricated and characterized in terms of electrical and piezoelectric properties. Next, experimental and simulation tests were performed, indicating that the decreasing thickness of the top poly(methyl methacrylate) layer (PMMA) can substantially enhance the piezoelectric sensitivity of the ZnO NW composite.

{"title": "Theoretical and Experimental Studies on MEMS Variable Cross-Section Cantilever Beam Based Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (PVEH) based on the variable cross-section cantilever beam (VCSCB) structure has the advantages of uniform axial strain distribution and high output power density, so it has become a research hotspot of the PVEH. However, its electromechanical model needs to be further studied. In this paper, the bidirectional coupled distributed parameter electromechanical model of the MEMS VCSCB based PVEH is constructed, analytically solved, and verified, which laid an important theoretical foundation for structural design and optimization, performance improvement, and output prediction of the PVEH. Based on the constructed model, the output performances of five kinds of VCSCB based PVEHs with different cross-sectional shapes were compared and analyzed. The results show that the PVEH with the concave quadratic beam shape has the best output due to the uniform surface stress distribution. Additionally, the influence of the main structural parameters of the MEMS trapezoidal cantilever beam (TCB) based PVEH on the output performance of the device is theoretically analyzed. Finally, a prototype of the Aluminum Nitride (AlN) TCB based PVEH is designed and developed.

{"title": "A Systematic Review of Piezoelectric Materials and Energy Harvesters for Industrial Applications.", "abstract": "In the last three decades, smart materials have become popular. The piezoelectric materials have shown key characteristics for engineering applications, such as in sensors and actuators for industrial use. Because of their excellent mechanical-to-electrical and vice versa energy conversion properties, piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric charge and voltage coefficient have been tested in renewable energy applications. The fundamental component of the energy harvester is the piezoelectric material, which, when subjected to mechanical vibrations or applied stress, induces the displaced ions in the material and results in a net electric charge due to the dipole moment of the unit cell. This phenomenon builds an electric potential across the material. In this review article, a detailed study focused on the piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEH's) is reported. In addition, the fundamental idea about piezoelectric materials, along with their modeling for various applications, are detailed systematically.

{"title": "Size Effect of a Piezoelectric Patch on a Rectangular Plate with the Neural Network Model.", "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have been widely used in many studies, such as the prediction of the piezoelectric effect of the plate of engineering structures in vibration and noise reduction. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to explore the piezoelectric patch size and thickness's effect on the first order natural frequency and displacement amplitude of a plate. With the finite element method (FEM), a rectangular plate actuated by a piezoelectric patch was analyzed with various patch sizes. The FEM data was later used to build an ANN model. The dynamic response of the plate was predicted by the ANN model and validated with FEM in terms of 1st order natural frequency and displacement amplitude. Results from case studies showed that with the input of patch length, width and thickness, ANN model can accurately predict both natural frequency and displacement amplitude. When the input of ANN model was simplified to patch size and thickness or the volume of the patch, the accuracy became worse and worse. The influence of the patch size and thickness on the first order natural frequency was coupled and the maximal and minimal values were predicted based on the ANN model.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["HequnMin", "JieZhang", "MuFan"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14123240\n10.1007/s00407-002-0059-5\n10.1007/BF01176807\n10.1016/0888-3270(91)90044-6\n10.1007/s00158-017-1886-y\n10.1016/j.cma.2014.08.011\n10.1016/0022-460X(90)90701-Z\n10.1007/s00419-004-0346-5\n10.1006/mssp.1993.1017\n10.1016/S0141-0296(97)00212-5\n10.1109/34.75512\n10.1016/j.neucom.2018.01.002\n10.1007/s11633-018-1122-2\n10.1016/S0164-1212(00)00005-4\n10.1016/j.ejbt.2015.05.001\n10.1242/jcs.123604\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030116\n10.1109/MSP.2010.936730\n10.1038/89044\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.001593\n10.1016/j.physa.2016.08.040\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2009.03.004\n10.1109/TIE.2004.824875\n10.1029/96WR03529\n10.1016/S0045-7825(97)00215-6\n10.1016/j.cma.2021.113885\n10.1016/j.simpat.2009.12.007\n10.1016/S0020-7683(99)00154-7\n10.1016/S0022-460X(02)01491-8\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2009.01.034"}

{"title": "High-Throughput Cell Concentration Using A Piezoelectric Pump in Closed-Loop Viscoelastic Microfluidics.", "abstract": "Cell concentration is a critical process in biological assays and clinical diagnostics for the pre-treatment of extremely rare disease-related cells. The conventional technique for sample preconcentration and centrifugation has the limitations of a batch process requiring expensive and large equipment. Therefore, a high-throughput continuous cell concentration technique needs to be developed. However, in single-pass operation, the required concentration ratio is hard to achieve. In this study, we propose a closed-loop continuous cell concentration system using a viscoelastic non-Newtonian fluid. For miniaturized and integrated systems, two piezoelectric pumps were adopted. The pumping capability generated by a piezoelectric pump in a microfluidic channel was evaluated depending on the applied voltage, frequency, sample viscosity, and channel length. The concentration performance of the device was evaluated using 13 \u03bcm particles and white blood cells (WBCs) with different channel lengths and voltages. In the closed-loop system, the focused cells collected at the center outlet were sent back to the inlet, while the buffer solution was removed to the side outlets. Finally, to expand the clinical applicability of our closed-loop system, WBCs in lysed blood samples with 70% hematocrit and prostate cancer cells in urine samples were used. Using the closed-loop system, WBCs were concentrated by ~63.4 \u00b1 0.8-fold within 20 min to a final volume of 160 \u03bcL using 10 mL of lysed blood sample with 70% hematocrit (~3 cP). In addition, prostate cancer cells in 10 mL urine samples were concentrated by ~64.1-fold within ~11 min due to low viscosity (~1 cP).", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["JeeyongKim", "HyunjungLim", "HyunseulJee", "SeungheeChoo", "MinjiYang", "SunghaPark", "KyounghwaLee", "HyoungsookPark", "ChaeseungLim", "JeonghunNam"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12060677\n10.1021/ac101866p\n10.1002/bit.260100509\n10.1128/CDLI.9.5.1142-1143.2002\n10.1002/elps.200390087\n10.1002/elps.200900017\n10.1039/C3LC51001H\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b01944\n10.1039/C5IB00288E\n10.1039/b509386d\n10.1016/j.jnnfm.2010.01.024\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.234501\n10.1038/s41598-019-39175-5\n10.1063/1.4944628\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.11.278\n10.1021/acsnano.7b02277\n10.1039/c2lc21304d\n10.1016/j.chroma.2015.06.029\n10.1039/C6LC00162A\n10.1063/1.4938389\n10.3390/mi10120817\n10.1016/j.talanta.2018.12.102\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05200\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00610\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.03.038\n10.1039/c3lc51176f\n10.1039/b720024b\n10.1038/s41598-017-10785-1\n10.1016/j.proeng.2014.11.402\n10.3390/mi10090584\n10.3390/mi10070462\n10.1016/j.proche.2009.07.378\n10.1039/C3RA43522A\n10.1122/1.550773\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.04.075\n10.1039/c3lc50101a\n10.1039/c2lc41248a\n10.3109/02656736.2013.775355\n10.1039/c1lc20346k\n10.1063/1.4897226\n10.1063/1.4972105\n10.1039/C9LC00624A\n10.1016/j.bpj.2019.05.022\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2019.103399\n10.1039/b410720a\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/11/115010\n10.1016/j.mee.2018.04.008\n10.1016/j.jemermed.2004.12.017\n10.1016/j.jns.2020.116876\n10.1038/sj.bmt.1703575\n10.1007/s10404-020-2331-x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0099409\n10.1039/C4AN00355A"}

In this work, 3D MEAs for cell-culture applications were fabricated using a piezoelectric inkjet printer. The aspect ratio and height of the printed 3D electrodes were user-defined by adjusting the number of deposited droplets of silver nanoparticle ink along with a continuous printing method and an appropriate drop-to-drop delay. The Ag 3D MEAs were later electroplated with Au and Pt in order to reduce leakage of potentially cytotoxic silver ions into the cellular medium.

{"title": "Electrospun Nanostructured Membrane Engineering Using Reverse Osmosis Recycled Modules: Membrane Distillation Application.", "abstract": "As a consequence of the increase in reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants, the number of discarded RO modules for 2020 was estimated to be 14.8 million annually. Currently, these discarded modules are disposed of in nearby landfills generating high volumes of waste. In order to extend their useful life, in this research study, we propose recycling and reusing the internal components of the discarded RO modules, membranes and spacers, in membrane engineering for membrane distillation (MD) technology. After passive cleaning with a sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution, these recycled components were reused as support for polyvinylidene fluoride nanofibrous membranes prepared by electrospinning technique. The prepared membranes were characterized by different techniques and, finally, tested in desalination of high saline solutions (brines) by direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The effect of the electrospinning time, which is the same as the thickness of the nanofibrous layer, was studied in order to optimize the permeate flux together with the salt rejection factor and to obtain robust membranes with stable DCMD desalination performance.

The main parameters such as molecular weight, initial sample thickness, stretching and poling were systematically applied, and their impact on sensing behavior was examined. The mechanical properties of prepared sheets were investigated via tensile testing on the samples with various initial thicknesses. The transformation of the \u03b1-phase to the electro-active \u03b2-phase was analyzed using FTIR after applying stretching and poling procedures as crucial post-processing techniques. As a complementary method, the XRD was applied, and it confirmed the crystallinity data resulting from the FTIR analysis. The highest degree of phase transformation was found in the PVDF sheet with a moderate molecular weight (Mw of 275 kDa) after being subjected to the highest axial elongation (500%); in this case, the \u03b2-phase content reached approximately 90%. Finally, the vibration sensing capability was systematically determined, and all the mentioned processing/molecular parameters were taken into consideration.

{"title": "Hysteresis Modeling and Compensation of Fast Steering Mirrors with Hysteresis Operator Based Back Propagation Neural Networks.", "abstract": "Fast steering mirrors (FSMs), driven by piezoelectric ceramics, are usually used as actuators for high-precision beam control. A FSM generally contains four ceramics that are distributed in a crisscross pattern. The cooperative movement of the two ceramics along one radial direction generates the deflection of the FSM in the same orientation. Unlike the hysteresis nonlinearity of a single piezoelectric ceramic, which is symmetric or asymmetric, the FSM exhibits complex hysteresis characteristics. In this paper, a systematic way of modeling the hysteresis nonlinearity of FSMs is proposed using a Madelung's rules based symmetric hysteresis operator with a cascaded neural network. The hysteresis operator provides a basic hysteresis motion for the FSM. The neural network modifies the basic hysteresis motion to accurately describe the hysteresis nonlinearity of FSMs. The wiping-out and congruency properties of the proposed method are also analyzed. Moreover, the inverse hysteresis model is constructed to reduce the hysteresis nonlinearity of FSMs. The effectiveness of the presented model is validated by experimental results.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["KairuiCao", "GuangluHao", "QingfengLiu", "LiyingTan", "JingMa"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12070732\n10.1109/TSMC.2017.2754863\n10.3390/s21061946\n10.1109/TMECH.2017.2703167\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.1518\n10.1109/TMECH.2010.2052366\n10.1109/TIE.2018.2879291\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984645\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/7/075008\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.12.034\n10.1109/TIE.2013.2257153\n10.3390/mi8040114\n10.3390/mi11040357\n10.3390/mi10030183\n10.3390/mi12010092\n10.3788/CJL201340.1113001\n10.1109/TCST.2007.906274\n10.3166/ejc.9.407-418\n10.1109/20.489552\n10.1109/TIE.2020.3036240"}
{"title": "Electrospun Fibers of Polybutylene Succinate/Graphene Oxide Composite for Syringe-Push Protein Absorption Membrane.", "abstract": "The adsorption of proteins on membranes has been used for simple, low-cost, and minimal sample handling of large volume, low protein abundance liquid samples. Syringe-push membrane absorption (SPMA) is an innovative way to process bio-fluid samples by combining a medical syringe and protein-absorbable membrane, which makes SPMA a simple, rapid protein and proteomic analysis method. However, the membrane used for SPMA is only limited to commercially available protein-absorbable membrane options. To raise the method's efficiency, higher protein binding capacity with a lower back pressure membrane is needed. In this research, we fabricated electrospun polybutylene succinate (PBS) membrane and compared it to electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Rolling electrospinning (RE) and non-rolling electrospinning (NRE) were employed to synthesize polymer fibers, resulting in the different characteristics of mechanical and morphological properties. Adding graphene oxide (GO) composite does not affect their mechanical properties; however, electrospun PBS membrane can be applied as a filter membrane and has a higher pore area than electrospun PVDF membrane. Albumin solution filtration was performed using all the electrospun filter membranes by the SPMA technique to measure the protein capture efficiency and staining of the protein on the membranes, and these membranes were compared to the commercial filter membranes-PVDF, nitrocellulose, and Whatman no. 1. A combination of rolling electrospinning with graphene oxide composite and PBS resulted in two times more captured protein when compared to commercial membrane filtration and more than sixfold protein binding than non-composite polymer. The protein staining results further confirmed the enhancement of the protein binding property, showing more intense stained color in compositing polymer with GO.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["NuankanyaSathirapongsasuti", "AnuchanPanaksri", "SaniBoonyagul", "SomchaiChutipongtanate", "NuttapolTanadchangsaeng"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13132042\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-21-0004\n10.3389/fmed.2021.548212\n10.18632/oncotarget.27941\n10.1093/ndt/gfz242\n10.1016/j.jprot.2021.104259\n10.1021/acs.est.5b05261\n10.1021/es100244s\n10.1186/s12014-015-9087-4\n10.1007/s11427-013-4582-1\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107086\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.018\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2020.100721\n10.1515/ntrev-2012-0078\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00593\n10.1016/j.mtchem.2020.100351\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.030\n10.1177/1558925003os-1200113\n10.1016/j.jcis.2013.04.004"}
{"title": "Tanning Wastewater Treatment by Ultrafiltration: Process Efficiency and Fouling Behavior.", "abstract": "Ultrafiltration is a promising, environment-friendly alternative to the current physicochemical-based tannery wastewater treatment. In this work, ultrafiltration was employed to treat the tanning wastewater as an upstream process of the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system in the leather industry. The filtration efficiency and fouling behaviors were analyzed to assess the impact of membrane material and operating conditions (shear rate on the membrane surface and transmembrane pressure). The models of resistance-in-series, fouling propensity, and pore blocking were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of such a process. The results show that the process efficiency is strongly dependent on the operating conditions, while the membranes of either PES or PVDF showed similar filtration performance and fouling behavior. Reversible resistance was the main obstacle for such process. Cake formation was the main pore blocking mechanism during such process, which was independent on the operating conditions and membrane materials. The increase in shear rate significantly increased the steady-state permeation flux, thus, the filtration efficiency was improved, which resulted from both the reduction in reversible resistance and the slow-down of fouling layer accumulate rate.

{"title": "Development of a Novel 2-DOF Rotary-Linear Piezoelectric Actuator Operating under Hybrid Bending-Radial Vibration Mode.", "abstract": "The paper presents a numerical and experimental investigation of a novel two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) piezoelectric actuator that can generate rotary motion of the sphere-shaped rotor as well as induce planar motion of the flat stage. The actuator has a small size and simple design and can be integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB). The application field of the actuator is small-dimensional and high-precision positioning systems. The piezoelectric actuator comprises three rectangular bimorph plates joined with arcs and arranged by an angle of 120 degrees. A high-stiffness rod is glued on the top surface of each bimorph plate and is used to rotate the rotor or move flat stage employing contact friction force.

{"title": "Deep Learning for Walking Behaviour Detection in Elderly People Using Smart Footwear.", "abstract": "The increase in the proportion of elderly in Europe brings with it certain challenges that society needs to address, such as custodial care. We propose a scalable, easily modulated and live assistive technology system, based on a comfortable smart footwear capable of detecting walking behaviour, in order to prevent possible health problems in the elderly, facilitating their urban life as independently and safety as possible. This brings with it the challenge of handling the large amounts of data generated, transmitting and pre-processing that information and analysing it with the aim of obtaining useful information in real/near-real time. This is the basis of information theory. This work presents a complete system aiming at elderly people that can detect different user behaviours/events (sitting, standing without imbalance, standing with imbalance, walking, running, tripping) through information acquired from 20 types of sensor measurements (16 piezoelectric pressure sensors, one accelerometer returning reading for the 3 axis and one temperature sensor) and warn the relatives about possible risks in near-real time. For the detection of these events, a hierarchical structure of cascading binary models is designed and applied using artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms and deep learning techniques. The best models are achieved with convolutional layered ANN and multilayer perceptrons.

{"title": "Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Based Metasurface for High-Quality Active Switching and Spectrum Shaping in the Terahertz G-Band.", "abstract": "We report theoretical investigations performed in the terahertz G-band, in the 228-232 GHz spectral window for a piezoelectrically-responsive ring-cone element metasurface composed of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/Silicon and PVDF/Silica glass. The choosing of this spectral window is motivated by a multitude of applications in terahertz detection and terahertz imaging, that commonly make use of this band. The uniqueness of the envisioned architecture resides in the combination between the readily-available polyvinylidene fluoride polymer and silicon/silica glass substrates, together with the introduction of an extra degree of freedom, in the form of a ring-cone architecture, and the active control of the geometric sizes through the longitudinal piezoelectric effect exhibited by the polymer. The spectral response of the metasurface is dependent on the combination between the polymer elements and the substrate, and ranges from near-zero absorption switching to a resonant behavior and significant absorption. The interaction between the electromagnetic field and the polymer-based metasurface also modifies the phase of the reflected and transmitted waves over a full 2\u03c0 range, permitting complete control of the electric field polarization. Moreover, we take advantage of the longitudinal piezoelectric effect of PVDF and analyze the spectrum shaping capability of the polymer-based metasurface. Our analysis highlights the capability of the proposed architecture to achieve complete electric field polarization control, near-zero optical switching and resonant behavior, depending on the geometries and sizes of the architecture elements resulting from construction considerations and from the externally applied voltages through the piezoelectric effect.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["OctavianDanila"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13111860\n10.1070/PU2003v046n07ABEH001614\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.4773\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.4184\n10.1126/science.1058847\n10.1063/1.2805016\n10.1364/OME.5.002313\n10.1126/science.1125907\n10.1364/OPTICA.4.000625\n10.1063/1.5116885\n10.1364/OE.21.016170\n10.1126/science.1126493\n10.1126/science.1210713\n10.1021/nl300204s\n10.1038/nmat3839\n10.1007/BF03046050\n10.1098/rspa.1984.0023\n10.1038/s41467-019-10027-0\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b05319\n10.1140/epjp/i2018-11997-8\n10.3762/bjnano.9.18\n10.1049/iet-opt.2018.5045\n10.1039/C7NR03824K\n10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107209\n10.3390/ma14092201\n10.1038/s41598-019-47649-9\n10.1121/1.387225\n10.1364/OL.22.000132\n10.3390/s20185214"}

The aim of the present in vivo study was to determine thermal changes of the bone tissue following osteotomies performed by Er:YAG laser ablation in contact and non-contact modes, piezoelectric surgery, and surgical drill using an infrared thermographic camera. For each measurement, the temperature before the osteotomy-baseline (Tbase) and the maximal temperature measured during osteotomy (Tmax) were determined. Mean temperature (\u0394T) values were calculated for each osteotomy technique. The significance of the difference of the registered temperature between groups was assessed by the ANOVA test for repeated measures.

A doubly clamped flexible piezoelectric energy harvester (FPEH) with axial excitation is therefore proposed for higher power output in a low-frequency vibration environment. Combining the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the D'Alembert principle, the differential dynamic equation of the doubly clamped energy harvester is derived, in which the excitation mode of axial load with pre-deformation is considered. A numerical solution of voltage amplitude and average power is obtained using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Output power of 22.5 \u03bcW at 27.1 Hz, with the optimal load resistance being 1 M\u03a9, is determined by the frequency sweeping analysis. In order to power electronic devices, the converted alternating electric energy should be rectified into direct current energy. By connecting to the MDA2500 standard rectified electric bridge, a rectified DC output voltage across the 1 M\u03a9 load resistor is characterized to be 2.39 V. For further validation of the mechanical-electrical dynamical model of the doubly clamped flexible piezoelectric energy harvester, its output performances, including both its frequency response and resistance load matching performances, are experimentally characterized. From the experimental results, the maximum output power is 1.38 \u03bcW, with a load resistance of 5.7 M\u03a9 at 27 Hz, and the rectified DC output voltage reaches 1.84 V, which shows coincidence with simulation results and is proved to be sufficient for powering LED electronics.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["JieMei", "QiongFan", "LijieLi", "DingfangChen", "LinXu", "QingyangDai", "QiLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/s21113861\n10.1007/s10439-012-0623-3\n10.1002/adfm.201700341\n10.1002/adma.201705195\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.011\n10.1063/1.5074184\n10.1021/nn502618f\n10.1021/nl104412b\n10.1002/adma.201603527\n10.1515/ehs-2016-0028\n10.1109/TIM.2020.3026462\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035021\n10.7567/JJAP.53.087101\n10.1007/s00542-014-2237-1\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.06.003\n10.1063/1.5023824\n10.34133/2019/1087946\n10.3390/s21072299\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaf5ae\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111807\n10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2020.103639"}

Improving the transferred energy, which is converted from mechanical energy to electrical energy through a piezoelectric transducer, achieved a high output voltage and effective harvesting. A threshold-based switching strategy is used to improve the total transferred energy with consideration of the signs and amplitudes of the electromechanical conditions of the harvester. A time-invariant threshold cannot accomplish effective harvesting under nonstationary vibration conditions because the assessment criterion for desirable control changes in accordance with the disturbance scale. To solve this problem, we developed a switching strategy for the active harvester, namely, adaptive switching considering vibration suppression-threshold strategy. The strategy adopts a tuning algorithm for the time-varying threshold and implements appropriate intermittent switching without pre-tuning by means of the fuzzy control theory. We evaluated the proposed strategy under three realistic vibration conditions: a frequency sweep, a change in the number of dominant frequencies, and wideband frequency vibration. Experimental comparisons were conducted with existing strategies, which consider only the signs of the harvester electromechanical conditions. The results confirm that the presented strategy achieves a greater output voltage than the existing strategies under all nonstationary vibration conditions.

Manufacturing stages of such a part requires an adapted design of explosive charge configurations to define the mechanical loading exerted on the part. This mechanical loading remains challenging to be experimentally determined but necessary for predictive numerical simulation in the design of parts to form. Providing that the actual mechanical impulse would allow the neglecting of the modelling of the detonation stage, this considerably increases the computational time. The present work proposes an experimental method for obtaining the exerted mechanical loading by HEHF on the part to form. It relies on the development of low-cost sensor based on a polyvinyliden fluorid (PVDF) gauge. In addition to it, an analytical approach based on shock physics is proposed for the sensor signal interpretation. The method considers the multi-layer aspect of the sensor and its intrusiveness with respect to waves propagation. Measurements were repeated to assess their relevance and the reproducibility by using steel and aluminium anvils in HEHF. Numerical modelling in 2D plane geometry of the experiments was performed with two commercial hydrocodes.

We used a piezoelectric sensor to measure the vibration signal of the bone conduction transducer (BCT) and separately calculated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the digitally filtered audio output and the unfiltered audio output using DSP. The SNR of the former was twice that of the latter, and the BCT output quality significantly improved. From the results, we can conclude that the dentary bone conduction system integrated with a DSP digital filter enhances sound quality.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["Jau-WoeiPerng", "Tung-LiHsieh", "Cheng-YanGuo"], "doi": "10.3390/s21124229\n10.1007/s11277-021-08083-1\n10.1007/s10297-006-0079-z\n10.1111/coa.12484\n10.2147/MDER.S39691\n10.1097/MAO.0b013e3182096b1d\n10.1121/1.2005847\n10.1016/j.heares.2017.07.005\n10.3390/electronics8121524\n10.1016/j.heares.2011.10.004\n10.3390/s150921394\n10.1109/T-ED.1967.15926\n10.1080/23311916.2017.1323373\n10.3109/14015439.2013.777109\n10.4236/cs.2015.62004"}
{"title": "Crack-Length Estimation for Structural Health Monitoring Using the High-Frequency Resonances Excited by the Energy Release during Fatigue-Crack Growth.", "abstract": "Acoustic waves are widely used in structural health monitoring (SHM) for detecting fatigue cracking. The strain energy released when a fatigue crack advances has the effect of exciting acoustic waves, which travel through the structures and are picked up by the sensors. Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) can effectively sense acoustic waves due to fatigue-crack growth. Conventional acoustic-wave passive SHM, which relies on counting the number of acoustic events, cannot precisely estimate the crack length. In the present research, a novel method for estimating the crack length was proposed based on the high-frequency resonances excited in the crack by the energy released when a crack advances. In this method, a PWAS sensor was used to sense the acoustic wave signal and predict the length of the crack that generated the acoustic event. First, FEM analysis was undertaken of acoustic waves generated due to a fatigue-crack growth event on an aluminum-2024 plate. The FEM analysis was used to predict the wave propagation pattern and the acoustic signal received by the PWAS mounted at a distance of 25 mm from the crack. The analysis was carried out for crack lengths of 4 and 8 mm. The presence of the crack produced scattering of the waves generated at the crack tip; this phenomenon was observable in the wave propagation pattern and in the acoustic signals recorded at the PWAS. A study of the signal frequency spectrum revealed peaks and valleys in the spectrum that changed in frequency and amplitude as the crack length was changed from 4 to 8 mm. The number of peaks and valleys was observed to increase as the crack length increased. We suggest this peak-valley pattern in the signal frequency spectrum can be used to determine the crack length from the acoustic signal alone. An experimental investigation was performed to record the acoustic signals in crack lengths of 4 and 8 mm, and the results were found to match well with the FEM predictions.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["RoshanJoseph", "HanfeiMei", "AsaadMigot", "VictorGiurgiutiu"], "doi": "10.3390/s21124221\n10.1016/S0143-974X(02)00064-0\n10.1016/0013-7944(73)90047-7\n10.1038/s41598-017-13226-1\n10.1016/S0143-974X(02)00065-2\n10.1088/1361-665X/aadd2d\n10.3390/met7070242\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9bc2\n10.1177/1475921717707356\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2018.04.027\n10.1007/s11012-007-9101-7\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.05.004\n10.3390/s20071983\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000829\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.12.015\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.11.016\n10.1007/s00707-019-02555-z\n10.3390/s20030826\n10.3390/s20113035\n10.1016/j.wavemoti.2015.05.009\n10.1023/A:1021888009896\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.04.067\n10.1007/s10921-017-0392-x\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2018.02.001\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2019.106544\n10.1117/12.2559958\n10.3390/s18010215\n10.3390/s19020383\n10.3390/s20205835"}

The system comprises of a piezoelectric transducer, a high-resolution data acquisition system, and a wireless communication module. A seismic piezoelectric transducer based on a piezoelectric simply supported beam using PMN-PT is proposed. High sensitivity is obtained by using a new piezoelectric material PMN-PT, and a simply supported beam matching with the PMN-PT wafer is designed, which can provide a good low-frequency response. The data acquisition system includes an electronic circuit for charge conversion, filtering, and amplification, an FPGA, and a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The wireless communication was based on the ZigBee modules and the WiFi modules. The experimental results show that the application of the piezoelectric simply supported beam based on PMN-PT can effectively improve the sensitivity of the piezoelectric accelerometer by more than 190%, compared with the traditional PZT material. At low frequencies, the fidelity of the PMN-PT piezoelectric simply supported beam is better than that of a traditional central compressed model, which is an effective expansion of the bandwidth to the low-frequency region. The charge conversion, filtering, amplification, and digitization of the output signal of the piezoelectric transducer are processed and, finally, are wirelessly transmitted to the monitoring centre, achieving the design of a seismic data acquisition system based on wireless transmission.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["YanxiaHuang", "JunleiSong", "WenqinMo", "KaifengDong", "XiangningWu", "JianyiPeng", "FangJin"], "doi": "10.3390/s21134308\n10.3390/s150100365\n10.3390/s19173734\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989280\n10.1016/j.comcom.2006.12.020\n10.1109/MWC.2010.5416357\n10.1109/JSEN.2012.2186564\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.03.014\n10.1063/1.3290251\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1983.tb15708.x\n10.1126/science.275.5308.1878\n10.1063/1.3327330\n10.1063/1.2894908\n10.1063/1.2437093\n10.1007/s00339-007-4343-8\n10.3390/s150306807\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.05.015\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.761.579\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.06.007\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.139-141.2460\n10.1007/s11071-008-9335-5\n10.1063/5.0007446\n10.1038/s41378-020-0170-2\n10.1007/s11071-011-0031-5\n10.1109/JMEMS.2002.805207\n10.1007/s11770-012-0324-6"}

{"title": "Smart Inlays for Simultaneous Crack Sensing and Arrest in Multifunctional Bondlines of Composites.", "abstract": "Disbond arrest features combined with a structural health monitoring system for permanent bondline surveillance have the potential to significantly increase the safety of adhesive bonds in composite structures. A core requirement is that the integration of such features is achieved without causing weakening of the bondline. We present the design of a smart inlay equipped with a micro strain sensor-system fabricated on a polyvinyliden fluorid (PVDF) foil material. This material has proven disbond arrest functionality, but has not before been used as a substrate in lithographic micro sensor fabrication. Only with special pretreatment can it meet the requirements of thin film sensor elements regarding surface roughness and adhesion. Moreover, the sensor integration into composite material using a standard manufacturing procedure reveals that the smart inlays endure this process even though subjected to high temperatures, curing reactions and plasma treatment. Most critical is the substrate melting during curing when sensory function is preserved with a covering caul plate that stabilizes the fragile measuring grids. The smart inlays are tested by static mechanical loading, showing that they can be stretched far beyond critical elongations of composites before failure. The health monitoring function is verified by testing the specimens with integrated sensors in a cantilever bending setup. The results prove the feasibility of micro sensors detecting strain gradients on a disbond arresting substrate to form a so-called multifunctional bondline.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["Chrestenvon der Heide", "JulianSteinmetz", "Martin JSchollerer", "ChristianH\u00fchne", "MichaelSinapius", "AndreasDietzel"], "doi": "10.3390/s21113852\n10.1016/j.promfg.2018.06.043\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2294626\n10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2016.03.025\n10.1007/s00542-013-2054-y\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.09.020\n10.1016/j.mee.2019.05.002\n10.1016/j.mee.2009.11.004\n10.1007/978-1-4419-7276-7-13\n10.1016/j.microrel.2008.06.030\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2539202\n10.1177/0021998304042393\n10.1117/12.715221\n10.1117/12.776315\n10.3390/polym13030330\n10.1109/AIM.2014.6878276\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2309172\n10.3390/s19081748\n10.1177/1475921715586625\n10.1177/1045389X14535017\n10.1117/12.2219361\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.04.014\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/057\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025017\n10.1117/12.917431\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/10/105011\n10.1177/1687814016688575\n10.1177/1475921711419994\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025016\n10.3390/s20061665\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.03.061\n10.3390/jcs5020051\n10.1080/00218464.2018.1555041\n10.1177/0954410020950071\n10.1520/CTR10314J\n10.3390/jcs4030138"}
{"title": "Radiation-Induced Graft Immobilization (RIGI): Covalent Binding of Non-Vinyl Compounds on Polymer Membranes.", "abstract": "Radiation-induced graft immobilization (RIGI) is a novel method for the covalent binding of substances on polymeric materials without the use of additional chemicals. In contrast to the well-known radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP), RIGI can use non-vinyl compounds such as small and large functional molecules, hydrophilic polymers, or even enzymes. In a one-step electron-beam-based process, immobilization can be performed in a clean, fast, and continuous operation mode, as required for industrial applications. This study proposes a reaction mechanism using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and two small model molecules, glycine and taurine, in aqueous solution. Covalent coupling of single molecules is achieved by radical recombination and alkene addition reactions, with water radiolysis playing a crucial role in the formation of reactive solute species. Hydroxyl radicals contribute mainly to the immobilization, while solvated electrons and hydrogen radicals play a minor role. Release of fluoride is mainly induced by direct ionization of the polymer and supported by water.

It provides useful clinical information, such as lumen size, vessel wall thickness, and plaque composition, by providing a cross-sectional vascular image. For several decades, IVUS has made remarkable progress in improving the accuracy of diagnosing cardiovascular disease that remains the leading cause of death globally. As the quality of IVUS images mainly depends on the performance of the IVUS transducer, various IVUS transducers have been developed.

{"title": "PVDF Composite Membranes with Hydrophobically-Capped CuONPs for Direct-Contact Membrane Distillation.", "abstract": "Water scarcity is an imminent problem that humanity is beginning to attempt to solve. Among the several technologies that have been developed to mitigate water scarcity, membrane distillation is of particular note. In the present work, CuO nanoparticles capped with 1-octanethiol (CuONPs@CH) or 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol (CuONPs@CF) are prepared. The nanoparticles are characterized by FT-IR and TGA methods. Two weight losses are observed in both cases, with the decomposition of the organic fragments beginning at 158 \u00b0C and 230 \u00b0C for CuONPs@CF and CuONPs@CH, respectively. Flat sheet PVDF composite membranes containing nanoparticles are prepared by the casting solution method using nanoparticle concentrations that ranged between 2-20% with a non-woven polyester fabric as support. The obtained membranes showed a thickness of 240 \u00b1 40 \u03bcm. According to water contact angle (87\u00b0 for CuONPs@CH and 95\u00b0 for CuONPs@CF, both at 10% w.t) and roughness (12 pixel for CuONPs@CH and 14 pixels for CuONPs@CF, both at 10% w.t) determinations, the hydrophobicity of membranes changed due to a decrease in surface energy, while, for naked CuONPs, the roughness factor represents the main role.

The main objectives include the development of this new sensor yarn as a first step. Then, we look towards the insertion of this sensor yarn into different woven structures followed by the monitoring of the mechanical behaviour of composite materials made with these fibrous reinforcements. The combined effect of the structural geometry and the number of PEDOT:PSS coating layers on the properties of the sensor yarns was investigated. It was found that the number of PEDOT:PSS coating layers could strongly influence the electromechanical behaviours of the sensor yarns. Different methods of characterization were employed on strain-sensor yarns with two and four coating layers of PEDOT:PSS. The piezo-resistive strain-sensor properties of these selected coating layers were evaluated. Cyclic stretching-releasing tests were also performed to investigate the dynamic strain-sensing behavior. The obtained results indicated that gauge factor values can be extracted in three strain regions for two and four coating layers, respectively. Moreover, these strain-sensor yarns showed accurate and stable sensor responses under cyclic conditions.

The miniaturization of the implants is a key research goal in these efforts, nominally because smaller implants result in less acute tissue damage. Implant size in most acoustic systems is limited by the piezoelectric bulk crystal used for power harvesting and data communication. Further miniaturization of the piezocrystal can degrade system power transfer efficiency and data transfer reliability. Here, we present a new method for packaging the implant piezocrystal; the method maximizes power transfer efficiency ( \u03b7 ) from the acoustic power at the piezo surface to the power delivered to the electrical load and information transfer across the acoustic link. Our method relies on placing piezo-to-substrate anchors to the piezo regions where the vibrational displacement of the mode of interest is zero.

However, the technique requires high-dexterity and microscale precision of experienced surgeons, who have to overcome the physiological hand tremor and limited visualization of the subretinal space.\nTo automatically guide the axial motion of microsurgical tools (i.e., a subretinal injector) with microscale precision in real time using a fiber-optic common-path swept-source optical coherence tomography distal sensor.\nWe propose, implement, and study real-time retinal boundary tracking of A-scan optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic depth targeting of a selected retinal boundary for accurate subretinal injection guidance. A simplified 1D U-net is used for the retinal layer segmentation on A-scan OCT images. A Kalman filter, combining retinal boundary position measurement by CNN and velocity measurement by cross correlation between consecutive A-scan images, is applied to optimally estimate the retinal boundary position. Unwanted axial motions of the surgical tools are compensated by a piezoelectric linear motor based on the retinal boundary tracking.\nCNN-based segmentation on A-scan OCT images achieves the mean unsigned error (MUE) of \u223c3\u2009\u2009pixels (8.1\u2009\u2009\u03bcm) using an ex vivo bovine retina model. GPU parallel computing allows real-time inference (\u223c2\u2009\u2009ms) and thus real-time retinal boundary tracking. Involuntary tremors, which include low-frequency draft in hundreds of micrometers and physiological tremors in tens of micrometers, are compensated effectively. The standard deviations of photoreceptor (PR) and choroid (CH) boundary positions get as low as 10.8\u2009\u2009\u03bcm when the depth targeting is activated.\nA CNN-based common-path OCT distal sensor successfully tracks retinal boundaries, especially the PR/CH boundary for subretinal injection, and automatically guides the tooltip's axial position in real time.

{"title": "Electrostatic footpads enable agile insect-scale soft robots with trajectory control.", "abstract": "Agility and trajectory control are two desirable features for robotics, but they become very challenging for soft robots without rigid structures to support rapid manipulations. Here, a curved piezoelectric thin film driven at its structural resonant frequency is used as the main body of an insect-scale soft robot for its fast translational movements, and two electrostatic footpads are used for its swift rotational motions. These two schemes are simultaneously executed during operations through a simple two-wire connection arrangement. A high relative centripetal acceleration of 28 body length per square second compared with existing robots is realized on a 65-milligram tethered prototype, which is better than those of common insects, including the cockroach. The trajectory manipulation demonstration is accomplished by navigating the robot to pass through a 120-centimeter-long track in a maze within 5.6 seconds. One potential application is presented by carrying a 180-milligram on-board sensor to record a gas concentration route map and to identify the location of the leakage source. The radically simplified analog motion adjustment technique enables the scale-up construction of a 240-milligram untethered robot. Equipped with a payload of 1660 milligrams to include the control circuit, a battery, and photoresistors, the untethered prototype can follow a designated, 27.9-centimeter-long \"S\"-shaped path in 36.9 seconds.

Several applications of Piezosurgery technology have been described, and the technique has recently been extended to otologic surgery. The piezoelectric device is a bone dissector which, using micro-vibration, preserves the anatomic integrity of soft tissue thanks to a selective action on mineralized tissue.\nAn anatomic dissection study was conducted on fresh-frozen adult cadaveric heads. Facial nerve decompression was performed by a middle cranial fossa approach in all specimens using the piezoelectric device under a surgical 3D exoscope visualization. After the procedures, the temporal bones were examined for evidence of any injury to the facial nerve or the cochleovestibular organs.\nIn all cases, it was possible to perform a safe dissection of the greater petrosal superficial nerve, the geniculate ganglion, and the labyrinthine tract of the facial nerve. No cases of semicircular canal, cochlea, or nerve damage were observed. All of the dissections were carried out with the ultrasonic device without the necessity to replace it with an otological drill.\nFrom this preliminary study, surgical decompression of the facial nerve via the middle cranial fossa approach using Piezosurgery seems to be a safe and feasible procedure.

Through the experiment, it was proved that this sensor can effectively identify the four kinds of basic acupuncture manipulations, i.e. reinforcing by twirling and rotating, reducing by twirling and rotating, reinforcing by lifting and thrusting and reducing by lifting and thrusting and it was conductive to the quantification and dissemination of acupuncture manipulations.\n\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9488\u7078\u624b\u6cd5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u9488\u523a\u65f6\u65bd\u529b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u7b49\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u91c7\u96c6\u9488\u523a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u201c\u637b\u8f6c\u201d\u548c\u201c\u63d0\u63d2\u201d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9635\u5217\u5f0f\u805a\u504f\u4e8c\u6c1f\u4e59\u70ef\u819c(PVDF)\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff1b\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7ccaC\u5747\u503c\u805a\u7c7b\u6cd5(FCM)\u7684\u9488\u523a\u624b\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u637b\u8f6c\u8865\u3001\u637b\u8f6c\u6cfb\u3001\u63d0\u63d2\u8865\u3001\u63d0\u63d2\u6cfb\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u9488\u523a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u9488\u523a\u624b\u6cd5\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u4f20\u64ad\u3002.", "journal": "Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research", "date": "2021-07-01", "authors": ["Sheng-YiGou", "ChongSu", "LeiWang", "Ya-NanZhao", "JieChen"], "doi": "10.13702/j.1000-0607.20210155"}

{"title": "Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Composite E-skin Fully Mimicking Human Skin.", "abstract": "Transparent e-skin that can fully mimic human skin with J-shaped mechanical-behavior and tactile sensing attributes have not yet been reported. In this work, the skin-like hydrogel composite with J-shaped mechanical behavior and highly transparent, tactile, soft but strong, flexible, and stretchable attributes is developed as structural strain sensing element for e-skin. Piezo-resistive polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel is used as supporting matrix to endow high transparency, softness, flexibility, stretch-ability and strain sensing capability desired for e-skin. Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber with a wavy configuration is designed as reinforcement filler to provide the tunable strain-limiting effect. As a result, the as-prepared UHMWPE fiber/PAAm composite e-skin presents unique \"J-shape\" stress-strain behavior akin to human skin. And the PAAm composite can switch from supersoft to highly stiff in the designed strain range up to 100% with a prominent tensile strength of 48.3 MPa, which enables it to have the high stretch-ability and excellent load-bearing ability, simultaneously. Moreover, finite element model is developed to clarify the stress distribution and damage evolution for the UHMWPE fiber/PAAm composite during the tensile process. The PAAm composite exhibits not only an excellent strain sensing performance with a long-term reliability up to 5000 loading-unloading cycles but also an extraordinary softness and mechanical strength with a low initial modulus of 6.7 kPa, which is matchable with soft human epidermis. Finally, the e-skin is used for demonstrations in monitoring various human activities and protecting structural integrity in designed strain ranges. The strategy for reinforcing piezo-resistive hydrogel with wavy-shaped UHMWPE fibers proposed here is promising for the development of transparent, flexible, soft but strong e-skin with a tunable strain-limiting effect akin to human skin.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2021-07-01", "authors": ["Feng-LianYi", "Fang-LiangGuo", "Yuan-QingLi", "De-YangWang", "PeiHuang", "Shao-YunFu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.1c05661"}

Autotransplantation has predictable results; in fact, many studies describe a success rate of over 90%. This article describes a case report concerning the surgical management of this surgical technique. An 18-year-old patient comes for the treatment of her left first mandibular molar (3.6) involved in decay process. An accurate radiological analysis (periapical X-ray and orthopantomographic evaluation) showed an immature left mandibular third molar (3.8), suitable as donor tooth. The mandibular first molar was extracted in an atraumatic way. The intra-alveolar septum was modified with a piezoelectric device. The tooth was slightly depressed in the socket and remained in infra-occlusion. It was stabilized by sutures and a metallic splint. Then, the autotransplanted molar was fixed with a double splinting for 4 weeks. In conclusion, the autotransplantation was followed by endodontic treatment. After 36 months of follow-up, wisdom tooth showed an improvement in clinical features in agreement with radiological examination. The success of this case can be attributed to the atraumatic surgical technique and the immature stage of the transplanted element.", "journal": "National journal of maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2021-07-01", "authors": ["LuigiTagliatesta", "FedericoGuerri", "SimoneMoscone", "Jason MottaJones"], "doi": "10.4103/njms.NJMS_192_20"}

The advantage of DPR lies in the preservation of the delicate triangular cartilaginous unity of the septal and upper lateral cartilages with its functional and esthetic implications in contrast to all resecting techniques. A variety of modifications of DPR have been published in recent years, each with advantages and disadvantages. The issue of hump recurrence remains a major concern in DPR. We describe the 'subdorsal Z-flap' and related techniques of DPR in detail, present two clinical case studies and discuss alternative technical modifications. The 'subdorsal Z -flap' combines the advantages of the high septal strip procedure with the advantages of the traditional 'low septal strip' or Cottle technique. By starting the incision at a high level, final septal height can be adjusted precisely. By creating a triangular shape with a vertical cut below the K-Area, which is usually the highest point of the hump, significant leverage can be applied from below the hump and the septal overlap may be sutured securely for a stable correction. In combination with Piezo osteotomy and full open approach, great precision and predictability can be achieved. In a recent publication, we presented more than 100 consecutive cases of subdorsal Z-flap DPR with good functional and esthetic outcomes. The subdorsal Z-flap modification is a combination of two popular DPR techniques, fusing their advantages while minimizing risk profile. A slightly higher degree of technical difficulty and necessary tissue dissection provides the benefits of better predictability and reduction of adverse outcomes.", "journal": "Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery", "date": "2021-06-30", "authors": ["MilosKovacevic", "Johannes AVeit", "Dean MToriumi"], "doi": "10.1097/MOO.0000000000000726\n10.1007/s00106-020-00949-3.\n10.1016/j.anorl.2020.06.018."}
{"title": "A Review on the Role and Performance of Cellulose Nanomaterials in Sensors.", "abstract": "Sensors and biosensors play a key role as an analytical tool for the rapid, reliable, and early diagnosis of human diseases. Such devices can also be employed for monitoring environmental pollutants in air and water in an expedited way. More recently, nanomaterials have been proposed as an alternative in sensor fabrication to achieve gains in performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and portability. In this direction, the use of cellulose nanomaterials (CNM), such as cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), and bacterial cellulose (BC), has experienced rapid growth in the fabrication of varied types of sensors. The advantageous properties are related to the supramolecular structures that form the distinct CNM, their biocompatibility, and highly reactive functional groups that enable surface functionalization. The CNM can be applied as hydrogels and xerogels, thin films, nanopapers and other structures interesting for sensor design. Besides, CNM can be combined with other materials (e.g., nanoparticles, enzymes, carbon nanomaterials, etc.) and varied substrates to advanced sensors and biosensors fabrication. This review explores recent advances on CNM and composites applied in the fabrication of optical, electrical, electrochemical, and piezoelectric sensors for detecting analytes ranging from environmental pollutants to human physiological parameters. Emphasis is given to how cellulose nanomaterials can contribute to enhance the performance of varied sensors as well as expand novel sensing applications, which could not be easily achieved using standard materials.

This method minimizes the average relative error in the values of conductance, susceptance, resistance, and reactance obtained from the 1-D model in the IEEE Standard (ANSI/IEEE Std 176-1987) and the experimental measurements of the first and second radial modes. Poisson's ratio is assumed to be a complex number in addition to the elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric coefficients in the present method. The global minimum of the average relative error is found by searching the minimum among all local minima of the average relative error, which are obtained with the Levenberg-Marquardt modification of Newton's method from randomly chosen initial conditions. The optimal material coefficients of an APC 850 disk and an APC 855 disk are calculated with this method.

A new algorithm is presented to virtually reconstruct realistic bone nanostructures, consisting of collagen fibrils embedded in a hydroxyapatite mineral network. This algorithm takes into account potential misalignments between fibrils, as well the porous structure of the mineral phase. A parallel non-iterative mesh generation algorithm is utilized to create high-fidelity FE models for several representative volume elements (RVEs) of the bone with various fibrils volume fractions and misalignments. The piezoelectric response of each RVE is simulated under three types of loading: the longitudinal compression, lateral compression, and shear. The resulting homogenized stress and electric field in RVEs with aligned fibrils showed a linear variation with the fibrils volume fraction under all loading conditions. For RVEs with misaligned fibrils, although more oscillations were observed in homogenized results, their difference with the results of RVEs with aligned fibrils subject to lateral compression and shear loadings were negligible. However, under longitudinal compression, the electric field associated with RVEs with misaligned fibrils was notably higher than that of RVEs with aligned fibrils for the same volume fraction.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2021-06-29", "authors": ["SalilPai", "JinhaKwon", "BowenLiang", "HannaCho", "SoheilSoghrati"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-021-01470-4\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.02.006\n10.1016/j.jmps.2011.06.005\n10.1038/scientificamerican1065-18\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00183\n10.1137/S0036144599352836\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2007.06.001\n10.1143/JJAP.3.117\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.05.043\n10.1016/0021-9290(73)90039-0\n10.1038/ncomms2490\n10.1007/s00707-010-0326-5\n10.1098/rsif.2010.0413\n10.1016/j.jmps.2004.03.006\n10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76426-5\n10.1016/j.ultramic.2005.10.005\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.009\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19960201)33:2<192::AID-JEMT9>3.0.CO;2-V\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104427\n10.1007/s00466-018-1664-8\n10.1007/BF02010135\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2017.03.003\n10.1007/s10237-010-0236-4\n10.1016/j.micron.2013.03.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029258\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/8/085706\n10.1529/biophysj.107.125567\n10.1038/nmat4789\n10.1016/0021-9290(94)00069-G\n10.1016/0021-9290(74)90018-9\n10.1126/science.aao2189\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.05.024\n10.1016/S1350-4533(98)00007-1\n10.1098/rsfs.2015.0055\n10.3389/fphy.2017.00039\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124602\n10.3109/03008207.2010.551567\n10.1016/j.finel.2016.11.003\n10.1007/s00223-015-9984-6\n10.1038/nmat1866\n10.1002/bip.1973.360120212\n10.1007/s00223-002-1077-7\n10.1007/s10237-013-0507-y\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.10.038\n10.1007/s10237-018-1016-9\n10.1038/nmat4089\n10.1016/0014-5793(91)80722-F\n10.1096/fasebj.6.3.1740237\n10.1146/annurev.matsci.28.1.271\n10.1529/biophysj.106.103192\n10.1529/biophysj.107.111013\n10.1002/9781119390350\n10.1007/s10237-010-0223-9\n10.1016/j.jmps.2010.07.004"}

{"title": "The Rheology of the Carotid Sinus: A Path Toward Bioinspired Intervention.", "abstract": "The association between blood viscosity and pathological conditions involving a number of organ systems is well known. However, how the body measures and maintains appropriate blood viscosity is not well-described. The literature endorsing the function of the carotid sinus as a site of baroreception can be traced back to some of the earliest descriptions of digital pressure on the neck producing a drop in blood delivery to the brain. For the last 30 years, improved computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of blood flow within the carotid sinus have demonstrated a more nuanced understanding of the changes in the region as it relates to changes in conventional metrics of cardiovascular function, including blood pressure. We suggest that the unique flow patterns within the carotid sinus may make it an ideal site to transduce flow data that can, in turn, enable real-time measurement of blood ", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2021-06-29", "authors": ["AndrewIskander", "CoskunBilgi", "RotemNaftalovich", "IlkerHacihaliloglu", "TolgaBerkman", "DanielNaftalovich", "NiemaPahlevan"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2021.678048\n10.1002/ajh.25683\n10.1098/rsif.2018.0486\n10.5056/jnm16114\n10.3109/10641968409062566\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313348\n10.1097/MD.0000000000018234\n10.3233/BIR-180202\n10.1016/j.jnnfm.2020.104263\n10.1371/journal.pone.0068929\n10.1055/s-0037-1608901\n10.3906/sag-1609-33\n10.7554/eLife.07370\n10.1016/j.repc.2019.04.008\n10.1177/1076029616634888\n10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352475\n10.1016/j.euromechflu.2017.12.009\n10.1089/acm.2011.0820\n10.1016/b978-0-12-677202-9.50019-8\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.02.004\n10.1186/s12964-020-0511-7\n10.1146/annurev.ph.42.030180.002213\n10.1051/medsci/20122812012\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1016/j.jocn.2019.05.041\n10.2459/01.JCM.0000369376.83887.7b\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.07.018\n10.1016/s0021-9290(01)00148-8\n10.1002/cnm.2529\n10.1016/j.tips.2019.10.002\n10.1073/pnas.1210236109\n10.1093/ajh/hpy184\n10.1532/hsf.2991\n10.1007/s00702-019-02088-8\n10.1016/s0001-6519(06)78668-x\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2018.02.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306301\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1968.214.5.955\n10.1007/s13244-017-0554-5\n10.1136/ard.52.2.104\n10.1016/0021-9150(89)90155-x\n10.23736/S0392-9590.17.03869-X\n10.1001/archotol.1990.01870070068012\n10.3171/2011.3.JNS101434\n10.1161/01.STR.0000111597.34179.47\n10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109441\n10.1016/S2213-2600(16)30159-X\n10.3233/CH-16183\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btz469\n10.1080/10255849908907986\n10.5551/jat.ED029\n10.1002/cnm.2836\n10.1001/archinte.1974.00320160071007\n10.1161/01.atv.3.1.31\n10.1016/0021-9290(87)90048-0\n10.1016/0301-5629(85)90003-1\n10.1161/01.atv.5.3.293\n10.1002/ajh.25933\n10.1115/1.2540836\n10.3390/diagnostics10070473\n10.1007/s00417-014-2804-2\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.079\n10.7554/eLife.12088\n10.4161/19336950.2014.986623\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.02.003\n10.1055/s-0038-1648479\n10.1098/rsif.2011.0177\n10.1001/jama.282.21.2035\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2003.09.032\n10.1007/s00424-011-0951-4\n10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6092049\n10.1016/j.conb.2019.11.004\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.012044\n10.1038/nrm.2017.92\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2004.01152.x\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2007.08.012\n10.1016/j.pupt.2014.07.005\n10.4297/najms.2010.2353\n10.1023/b:verc.0000047507.85689.90\n10.1115/1.2895428\n10.1177/2047487316672004\n10.1002/ar.23829\n10.3233/bir-1981-183-615\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1080/09674845.2010.11730293\n10.1152/ajpheart.1994.266.4.H1528\n10.1038/s41467-017-00429-3\n10.7554/eLife.43226\n10.1016/j.matbio.2014.11.001\n10.1186/s13098-019-0466-2\n10.1080/14017430903171248\n10.1177/1753944717745507\n10.1186/s12883-017-0808-3\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btw373\n10.1177/0284185114526713\n10.7554/eLife.07369\n10.3233/bir-1973-10311\n10.3233/bir-1976-13306\n10.3233/bir-1979-16303\n10.1053/j.jvca.2015.06.025\n10.1016/j.euromechflu.2020.05.011\n10.1007/s10439-020-02527-8\n10.1007/s12195-011-0179-6\n10.1111/micc.12035\n10.1016/s0002-8703(05)80243-1\n10.1136/hrt.2006.108167\n10.1038/nrm2592\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.09.004\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.1007/s10237-018-1045-4\n10.1016/j.neulet.2016.07.058\n10.1126/science.aau6324\n10.1186/s12938-018-0589-y\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.10.001\n10.1186/s12938-018-0465-9\n10.18632/oncotarget.23191\n10.1080/10255842.2011.625358\n10.7554/eLife.44003\n10.1002/clc.4960270813"}

Overall, this study highlights the importance of exploiting cell-material interactions to match tissue biological needs to sustain the wound healing cascade.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2021-06-25", "authors": ["NowsheenGoonoo", "FannyGimi\u00e9", "ImadeAit-Arsa", "ColetteCordonin", "JessicaAndries", "DhanjayJhurry", "ArchanaBhaw-Luximon"], "doi": "10.1039/d1bm00379h"}

However, most well-established OMSs are static, featuring well-defined optical responses determined by OMS configurations set during their fabrication, whereas dynamic OMS configurations investigated so far often exhibit specific limitations and reduced reconfigurability. Here, by combining a thin-film piezoelectric microelectromechanical system (MEMS) with a gap-surface plasmon-based OMS, we develop an electrically driven dynamic MEMS-OMS platform that offers controllable phase and amplitude modulation of the reflected light by finely actuating the MEMS mirror. Using this platform, we demonstrate MEMS-OMS components for polarization-independent beam steering and two-dimensional (2D) focusing with high modulation efficiencies (~50%), broadband operation (~20% near the operating wavelength of 800 nanometers), and fast responses (<0.4 milliseconds).

Inhibiting the Atr-associated checkpoint complex in neurons promotes regeneration and improves synapse/behavioral recovery after CNS injury. Independent of DNA damage, Atr responds to the mechanical stimulus elicited during regeneration, via the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo and its downstream NO signaling. Sensory neuron-specific knockout of Atr in adult mice, or pharmacological inhibition of Atr-Chek1 in mammalian neurons in vitro and in flies in vivo enhances regeneration.

This method allows phase-sensitive tomographic measurement in the depth direction at a multi-MHz scan rate using a frequency-modulated broadband electrooptic multi-GHz supercontinuum comb. The frequency spacing was swept instantaneously in time and axisymmetrically about the center wavelength via a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator driven by a variable radio frequency signal. This unique sweeping method permits direct measurement of fringe-free interferometric amplitude and phase with arbitrarily changeable measurement range and scan rate. Therefore, a compressive measurement can be made in only the depth region where the vibration exists, reducing the number of measurement points. In a proof-of-principle experiment, the interferometric amplitude and phase were investigated for in-phase and quadrature phase-shifted interferograms obtained by a polarization demodulator.

{"title": "The Form and Function of PIEZO2.", "abstract": "Mechanosensation is the ability to detect dynamic mechanical stimuli (e.g., pressure, stretch, and shear stress) and is essential for a wide variety of processes, including our sense of touch on the skin.

A major breakthrough occurred in 2010 with the discovery of a family of mechanically gated ion channels that were coined PIEZOs.

{"title": "Mechanical Metamaterials Gyro-Structure Piezoelectric Nanogenerators for Energy Harvesting under Quasi-Static Excitations in Ocean Engineering.", "abstract": "In this study, we develop the mechanical metamaterial-enabled piezoelectric nanogenerators in the gyro-structure, which is reported as a novel green energy solution to generate electrical power under quasi-static excitations (i.e., <1 Hz) such as in the ocean environment. The plate-like mechanical metamaterials are designed with a hexagonal corrugation to improve their mechanical characteristics (i.e., effective bending stiffnesses), and the piezoelectric trips are bonded to the metaplates. The piezo-metaplates are placed in the sliding cells to obtain the post-buckling response for energy harvesting under low-frequency ocean motions. The corrugated mechanical metamaterials are fabricated using the three-dimensional additive manufacturing technique and are bonded with polyvinylidene fluoride strips, and the nanogenerator samples are investigated under the quasi-static loading. Theoretical and numerical models are developed to obtain the electrical power, and satisfactory agreements are observed. Optimization is conducted to maximize the generated electrical power with respect to the geometric consideration (i.e., changing the corrugation pattern of the mechanical metamaterials) and the material consideration (i.e., changing the mechanical metamaterials to anisotropic). In the end, we consider the piezoelectric nanogenerators as a potential green solution for the energy issues in other fields.", "journal": "ACS omega", "date": "2021-06-22", "authors": ["PengchengJiao", "YangYang", "KingJames IdalaEgbe", "ZhiguoHe", "YingtienLin"], "doi": "10.1021/acsomega.1c01687\n10.1103/physrevlett.102.080601\n10.1016/j.renene.2010.06.014\n10.1002/er.3851\n10.1515/jmmm-2016-0161\n10.1016/j.rser.2005.08.004\n10.1038/nmat4834\n10.1021/acsnano.6b04213\n10.1016/j.jsv.2005.10.003\n10.1177/1045389x18786456\n10.1177/1045389x12473379\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035021\n10.1177/1045389x17754270\n10.1109/48.972090\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.052\n10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.019\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.11.032\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.06.066\n10.1038/s41467-021-20919-9\n10.1038/s41586-020-1985-6\n10.1088/1361-6528/abb84b\n10.1002/adfm.202000477\n10.1021/acsnano.8b08567\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104646\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105555\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106074\n10.1109/tie.2020.2978727\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/054015\n10.1039/c7mh00699c\n10.1016/j.eml.2015.05.002\n10.1103/physrevlett.114.185502\n10.1103/physrevapplied.9.021002\n10.1002/admi.201800284\n10.1103/physrevapplied.9.064013\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2018.06.005\n10.1126/science.1255908\n10.1126/science.1252291\n10.1002/adma.201502809\n10.1126/science.aao4640\n10.1016/j.jmps.2017.02.011\n10.1103/physrevapplied.2.054007\n10.1088/1361-665x/aa746e\n10.1002/stc.2052\n10.1016/j.matdes.2019.108214\n10.3390/s20133730\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.04.046\n10.1061/(asce)em.1943-7889.0000443\n10.1088/1361-6501/aa6c8e\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2018.09.028\n10.1103/physrevapplied.11.034055\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2010.04.010\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115005\n10.1063/1.4977842"}
{"title": "Lower third molar inclusion associated with paraesthesia: A case report.", "abstract": "When lower third molar inclusion is associated with neurosensorial complications, the treatment of choice is its surgical avulsion. One of these complications, that may be the most alarming during a first medical examination, is hemi-lip paraesthesia, that can appear in the presence of several mandibular lesions. This is a report of a rare clinical case in which paraesthesia was linked to the closeness between the root block of the dental element and the mandibular canal, which houses the neurovascular trunk of the lower mandibular nerve. A 64 year-old male Caucasian patient, presented with the chief complaint of past periodic inflammatory events in the retromolar region of the oral cavity and hemi-lip paraesthesia. Upon local clinical and radiological examination, a lower left third molar with class 3 position C inclusion was incriminated. The medical history of the patient revealed well compensated diabetes mellitus type II, and pharmacologically controlled hypertension. The tooth was surgically removed using piezoelectric instruments. Before and after surgery, three types of tests (tactile, pain and thermal sensitivity) were carried out to delimit the area affected by paraesthesia. At 7 days, the area of hypoesthesia of the hemi-lip was significantly reduced. Further improvement in tactile and thermal sensitivity occurred in subsequent follow-up, at 1 and 3 months, postoperatively. This clinical case demonstrates that the surgical intervention performed with piezoelectric instruments prevented the damage of an important structure such as the lower mandibular nerve, and promoted regression of a contingent paraesthesia.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2021-06-22", "authors": ["Alessandro EspeditoDi Lauro", "MariusBoariu", "PasqualeSammartino", "FabioScotto", "RobertaGasparro", "Stefan-IoanStratul", "DarianRusu", "AlexandraRoman", "PetraSurlin", "SorinaSolomon"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2021.10258\n10.1016/s0901-5027(05)80814-8\n10.1016/s1079-2104(96)80371-4\n10.1016/s1079-2104(99)70213-1\n10.1016/0030-4220(86)90054-x\n10.1016/j.jcma.2015.01.009\n10.1016/j.joms.2016.12.013\n10.1016/s0901-5027(05)80447-3\n10.1016/j.joms.2008.07.005\n10.1016/j.joms.2012.05.013\n10.1016/j.joms.2018.11.015\n10.14219/jada.archive.1980.0183\n10.1016/0278-2391(85)90331-3\n10.1016/j.joms.2004.05.217\n10.1016/j.joms.2004.05.214\n10.1016/j.jds.2019.08.006\n10.4103/ams.ams_138_18"}

{"title": "A Novel Coupled Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer Based on Piston Mode.", "abstract": "This article presents a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (pMUT) modified with a piston diaphragm term as piston diaphragm pMUT (PD-pMUT). The transmission sound pressure level (SPL) and the frequency bandwidth of the modified transducer can be remarkably improved by adding a piston diaphragm on the central circular diaphragm. In this work, a lumped model, an acoustic resonance model, and an equivalent circuit model are established to study the multiresonance mechanism. The second resonance peak is contributed by the interference acoustic wave generated between the circular and piston diaphragms. This work demonstrated a simulated far-field average SPL up to 132.2 dB in the single modified piston diaphragm structure and a 28.1%-6-dB frequency bandwidth by theoretical analysis and parameter optimization. The bandwidth is 3.31 times of the traditional pMUT with aluminum nitride (AlN) in air. In addition, the PD-pMUT has a -6-dB frequency bandwidth of up to 66%, which is 1.4 times of traditional pMUT in the liquid-coupled operation.

{"title": "Endurance testing and finite element simulation of a modified hip stem for integration of an energy harvesting system.", "abstract": "Instrumented implants are a promising approach to further improve the clinical outcome of total hip arthroplasties. For the integrated sensors or active functions, an electrical power supply is required. Energy harvesting concepts can provide autonomous power with unlimited lifetime and are independent from external equipment. However, those systems occupy space within the mechanically loaded total hip replacement and can decrease the life span due to fatigue failure in the altered implant. We previously presented a piezoelectric energy harvesting system for an energy-autonomous instrumented total hip stem that notably changes the original implant geometry. The aim of this study was to investigate the remaining structural fatigue failure strength of the metallic femoral implant component in a worst-case scenario. Therefore, the modified hip stem was tested under load conditions based on ISO 7206-4:2010. The required five\u2009million cycles were completed twice by all samples (n\u2009=\u20093). Additionally applied cycles with incrementally increased load levels up to 4.7\u2009kN did not induce implant failure. In total, 18\u2009million cycles were endured, outperforming the requirements of the ISO standard. Supplementary finite element analysis was conducted to determine stress distribution within the implant. A high stress concentration was found in the region of modification. The stress level showed an increase compared to the previously evaluated physiological loading situation and was close to the fatigue data from the literature. The stress concentration factor compared to the original geometry amounted to 2.56.

(Siegel et al. [2019] CA: A Cancer J Clin.69(1):7-34.) Focal laser ablation (FLA) has the potential to control small tumors while preserving urinary and erectile function by leaving the neurovascular bundles and urethral sphincters intact. Accurate needle guidance is critical to the success of FLA. Multiparametric magnetic resonance images (mpMRI) can be used to identify targets, guide needles, and assess treatment outcomes. The purpose of this work was to design and evaluate the accuracy of an MR-compatible mechatronic system for in-bore transperineal guidance of FLA ablation needles to localized lesions in the prostate.\nThe mechatronic system was constructed entirely of non-ferromagnetic materials, with actuation controlled by piezoelectric motors and optical encoders. The needle guide hangs between independent front and rear two-link arms, which allows for horizontal and vertical translation as well as pitch and yaw rotation of the guide with a 6.0\u00a0cm range of motion in each direction. Needles are inserted manually through a chosen hole in the guide, which has been aligned with the target in the prostate. Open-air positioning error was evaluated using an optical tracking system (0.25\u00a0mm RMS accuracy) to measure 125 trajectories in free space. Correction of systematic bias in the system was performed using 85 of the trajectories, and the remaining 40 were used to estimate the residual error. The error was calculated as the horizontal and vertical displacement between the axis of the desired and measured trajectories at a typical needle insertion depth of 10\u00a0cm. MR-compatibility was evaluated using a grid phantom to assess image degradation due to the presence of the system, and induced force, heating, and electrical interference in the system were assessed qualitatively. In-bore positioning error was evaluated on 25 trajectories.\nOpen-air mean positioning error at the needle tip was 0.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u00a0mm with a one-sided 95% confidence interval of 1.40\u00a0mm. The mean deviation of needle trajectories from the planned direction was 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\nA complete system for delivering needles to localized prostate tumors was developed and described in this work, and its compatibility with the MR environment was demonstrated.

However, no effective method aiming at large-area uniform organic ferroelectric LB film has ever been reported to date. Herein, we present a facile hot-pressing strategy to prepare relatively large-area poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) LB film with ultra-smooth surface root mean square (RMS) roughness is 0.3\u00a0nm in a 30\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0\u03bcm area comparable to that of metal substrate, which maximized the potential of LB technique to control thickness distribution. More importantly, compared with traditionally annealed LB film, the hot-pressed LB film manifests significantly improved structure uniformity, less fluctuation in ferroelectric characteristics and higher dielectric and piezoelectric responses, owing to the uniform dipole orientation and higher crystalline quality. Besides, different surface charge relaxation behaviors are investigated and the underlying mechanisms are explained in the light of the interplay of surface charge and polarization charge in the case of nanoscale non-uniform switching. We believe that our work not only presents a novel strategy to endow PVDF LB film with unprecedented reliability and improved performance as a competitive candidate for future ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) and nano electro mechanical systems (NEMS), but also reveals an attracting coupling effect between the surface potential distribution and nanoscale non-uniform switching behavior, which is crucial for the understanding of local transport characterization modulated by band structure, bit signal stability for data-storage application and the related surface charge research, such as charge gradient microscopy (CGM) based on the collection of surface charge on the biased ferroelectric domains.", "journal": "Science bulletin", "date": "2021-06-15", "authors": ["ShanHe", "MengfanGuo", "ZhenkangDan", "ShunLan", "WeibinRen", "LeZhou", "YueWang", "YuhanLiang", "YunpengZheng", "JiayuPan", "YangShen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scib.2021.02.004"}
{"title": "Sensory innervation of the human male prepuce: Meissner's corpuscles predominate.", "abstract": "Meissner's corpuscles are the most abundant sensory corpuscles in the glabrous skin of the male prepuce. They are type I, rapidly adapting, low-threshold mechanoreceptors, and their function is linked to the expression of the mechanoprotein piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (PIEZO2). Stimulation of genital Meissner's corpuscles gives rise to sexual sensations. It has been recently demonstrated that digital Meissner's corpuscles, Meissner-like corpuscles, and genital end bulbs have an endoneurium-like capsule surrounding their neuronal elements; that is, the axon and glial lamellar cells, and their axons, display PIEZO2 immunoreactivity. It is unknown whether this is also the case for preputial Meissner's corpuscles. Furthermore, the expression of certain proteins that have been found in Meissner's corpuscles at other anatomical locations, especially in the digits, has not been investigated in preputial Meissner's corpuscles. Here, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of axonal (neurofilament, neuron-specific enolase), glial (S100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin), endoneurial (CD34), and perineurial (glucose transporter 1) markers in the preputial and digital Meissner's corpuscles of male participants aged between 5 and 23\u00a0years. Furthermore, we investigated the occurrence of the mechanoprotein PIEZO2 in male preputial Meissner's corpuscles. Human male prepuce contains numerous Meissner's corpuscles, which may be grouped or isolated and are regularly distributed in the dermal papillae. Lamellar glial cells display strong expression of S100 protein and vimentin but lack expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein. In addition, they show axonal PIEZO2 expression and have an endoneurial capsule, but no perineurial. Our results indicate that human male preputial Meissner's corpuscles share the immunohistochemical profile of digital Meissner's corpuscles, which is considered to be necessary for mechanotransduction. These data strongly suggest that the structure and function of Meissner's corpuscles are independent of their anatomical location.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2021-06-14", "authors": ["YolandaGarc\u00eda-Mesa", "JorgeGarc\u00eda-Piqueras", "Ram\u00f3nCobo", "Jos\u00e9Mart\u00edn-Cruces", "Iv\u00e1nSuazo", "OliviaGarc\u00eda-Su\u00e1rez", "JorgeFeito", "Jos\u00e9 AVega"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.13481\n10.1016/j.neuron.2013.07.051\n10.1002/ar.23522\n10.1016/j.urology.2004.11.007\n10.1016/j.juro.2015.12.080\n10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11761.x\n10.1007/s00418-014-1278-y\n10.1007/s10571-010-9511-2\n10.1111/andr.12779\n10.3390/jcm10020227\n10.3390/ijms2117622\n10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.0830s1034.x\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1002/sm2.67\n10.1016/j.aanat.2018.05.001\n10.1007/s11515-013-1271-1\n10.1111/joa.12688\n10.1111/joa.13139\n10.1111/joa.12983\n10.1016/0006-8993(86)90357-4\n10.1111/j.1464-410X.2013.11794.x\n10.1007/112_2015_26\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.026\n10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.09.001\n10.1016/s0959-4388(00)00234-8\n10.1002/wsbm.1267\n10.1002/nau.22850\n10.1038/nature13250\n10.2164/jandrol.112.016709\n10.1002/ca.22501\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.08.004\n10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.001\n10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.01.001\n10.1111/bju.12128_9\n10.1111/jebm.12361\n10.1186/s12963-016-0073-5\n10.1002/wdev.229\n10.1101/cshperspect.a013656\n10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00471.x\n10.1056/NEJM199005033221811\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x\n10.1046/j.1464-410x.1996.85023.x\n10.1038/aja.2013.47\n10.1002/jemt.20651\n10.1111/joa.12327\n10.1038/jid.1956.5\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.09.004\n10.1126/science.1254229"}

Adjacent neurovascular structures are at risk, however, when drilling is performed in this deep and narrow area. Hence, this study evaluates the use of Piezosurgery (PS) as a non-rotating tool for selective bone cutting in CPA surgery. A Piezosurgery\u00ae device was used in 36 patients who underwent microsurgery for extra-axial CPA or petroclival tumors in our Neurosurgical Department between 2013 and 2019. The clinical and radiological data were retrospectively analyzed. The use of PS was evaluated with respect to the intraoperative applicability and limitations as well as efficacy and safety of the procedure. Piezosurgical petrous bone cutting was successfully performed in the removal of meningiomas or extra-axial metastases arising from the dura of the petroclival region (21 patients) or petrous bone (15 patients). PS proved to be very helpful in the deep and narrow CPA region, considerably reducing the surgeon's distress toward bone removal in close proximity to cranial nerves and vessels in comparison to common rotating drills. The use of PS was safe without injuries to neurovascular structures. Gross total resection was achieved in 67% of petroclival and 100% of petrous bone tumors. Piezosurgery proved to be an effective and safe method for selective petrous bone cutting in CPA surgery avoiding rotating power and associated risks.

The effects of these parameters on the properties of the as-printed tablets were studied using a powder mixture of lactose monohydrate and Kollidon\u00ae VA64 (KL) and an aqueous binder containing 5% of KL. The appropriate processing windows for two different powder spreading rates were identified, and the final properties of the printed samples were explained using a dimensionless \"degree of overlap\" parameter which is defined as the ratio between the penetrating depth of the binder into the powder and the build layer thickness. Lastly, 10% of indomethacin was added to the powder feedstock as a model drug.

{"title": "Widespread Negative Longitudinal Piezoelectric Responses in Ferroelectric Crystals with Layered Structures.", "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of the universal negative piezoelectricity in low-dimensional layered materials by carrying out first-principles calculations. Two-dimensional layered ferroelectric CuInP_{2}S_{6} is analyzed in detail as a typical example, but the theory can be applied to any other low-dimensional layered piezoelectrics. Consistent with the theory proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 207601 (2017)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.119.207601, the anomalous negative piezoelectricity in CuInP_{2}S_{6} also results from its negative clamped-ion term, which cannot be compensated by the positive internal-strain part. Here, we focus on a more general rule by proposing that having a negative clamped-ion term should be universal among piezoelectric materials, which is attributed to the \"lag of Wannier center\" effect. The internal-strain term, which is the change in polarization due to structural relaxation in response to strain, is mostly determined by the spatial structure and chemical bonding of the material. In a low-dimensional layered piezoelectric material such as CuInP_{2}S_{6}, the internal-strain term is approximately zero. This is because the internal structure of the molecular layers, which are bonded by the weak van der Waals interaction, responds little to the strain. As a result, the magnitude of the dipole, which depends strongly on the dimension and structure of the molecular layer, also has a small response with respect to strain. An equation bridging the internal strain responses in low-dimensional and three-dimensional piezoelectrics is also derived to analytically express this point. This work aims to deepen our understanding about this anomalous piezoelectric effect, especially in low-dimensional layered materials, and provide strategies for discovering materials with novel electromechanical properties.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2021-06-12", "authors": ["YuboQi", "Andrew MRappe"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.217601"}

In this work, a new hybrid membrane of ZIF-67/PVDF with varying ZIF-67 dosages has been fabricated through a facile mechanical blending followed by a lyotropic phase transition. Methods including field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR analyses and surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity measurements are applied to characterize the structure, physicochemical properties and membrane performances. Two synthetic triarylmethane dyes, cationic malachite green (MG) and anionic fuchsin acid (FA), are chosen as the main adsorption targets to evaluate the adsorption capacities of the resulting ZIF-67/PVDF hybrid membranes. Interestingly, all of the ZIF-67/PVDF hybrid membranes exhibit distinctly favorable efficiencies and selectivities toward MG and FA compared to pristine PVDF, which proves the positive roles of ZIF-67 in the adsorption ability of the hybrid membranes. The adsorption conditions are optimized and the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics are analysed to study the adsorption mechanism.

Two typical top electrodes, namely inner electrode (IE) and outer electrode (OE), are designed and fabricated. The measured transmitting velocities of the fabricated PMUTs at resonance under a drive voltage of 5 [Formula: see text] (peak-to-peak) are 15.36 mm/s for the IE design and 20.67 mm/s for the OE design with a circular diaphragm and 16.62 mm/s for the IE design and 22.18 mm/s for the OE design with a hexagonal diaphragm. The OE design demonstrates a transmitting velocity improvement of 34.57% for the circular diaphragm and 33.45% for the hexagonal diaphragm. The improvement is due to the fact that the OE design shows higher quality factor ( Q ) than the IE counterpart. Moreover, the resonant frequency of the OE design is higher than that of the IE design, which results in a larger acoustic pressure output and hence higher transmitting sensitivity.

Pasteurized, separated Cheddar cheese whey (1,080 kg) was microfiltered using a polymeric 0.3-\u03bcm polyvinylidene (PVDF) fluoride SW membrane and a 3\u00d7, 3-stage MF process. Cheese making and whey processing were replicated 3 times. There was no detectable level of lactoferrin and no intact \u03b1- or \u03b2-casein detected in the MF permeate from the 0.3-\u03bcm SW PVDF membranes used in this study. We found BSA and IgG in both the retentate and permeate. The \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2-LG) and \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-LA) partitioned between retentate and permeate, but \u03b2-LG passage through the membrane was retarded more than \u03b1-LA because the ratio of \u03b2-LG to \u03b1-LA was higher in the MF retentate than either in the sweet whey feed or the MF permeate.

The surface of titanium-based materials with piezoelectric properties similar to human bone promotes the growth of osteoblasts. However, not only new bone growth but also osseointegration are observed in the process of bone repair. The hydrophobicity of PVDF coating is unfavorable for mineralization. In this study, a PVDF coating was prepared on the titanium surface by using titanium dioxide nanotubes as a transition layer, and PVDF was attached to the wall of the titanium dioxide nanotube. The contact angle of the polarized PVDF coating decreases from 108\u00b0 to 47\u00b0, which indicates that it changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic due to the reduction in surface energy and the effect of negative surface charge. After the coating is left for a period of time, its contact angle only increases by 20\u00b0 due to the loss of negative surface charge. After a physiological loading is applied to the polarized PVDF coating, the durability of its surface hydrophilicity is maintained. The mineralization ability of the polarized PVDF coating after being immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 1, 7, and 14 days is significantly higher than that of the unpolarized sample. The increase in mineralization ability is mainly due to the hydrophilicity of the surface and the attraction of negative charges to calcium ions. Notably, after the polarized PVDF coating is subjected to physiological load, the mineralization ability is further improved after being immersed in SBF for 14 days, and its surface is covered with a layer of bone-like apatite. The high mineralization ability of the PVDF coating on the titanium surface after polarization can promote osseointegration and therefore shorten the bone repair cycle.

In this paper, an analytical model based on the superposition method is developed to obtain the coupled dynamic response of a piezoelectric cylinder under an applied voltage. The problem can be described mathematically by three partial differential equations with mixed boundary conditions in the cylindrical coordinates system. To solve this, the problem is decomposed first into two building block - vibrations in radial and thickness directions. In each building block, the expressions of displacements and electric potential are assumed and then the induced dynamic responses, such as in-plane stress and electric displacements, are calculated. Finally, the vibration responses of the two building blocks are superimposed to satisfy the mixed boundary conditions using Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series expansions. Electrical impedance of a typical piezoelectric disk and frequency spectrum of piezoelectric cylinders of different diameter-to-thickness ratios are calculated by the present analytical method as well as by finite element method.

Complete freedom of movement is allowed, and any kind of drawing style can be performed using currently available graphics software.\nEEG recordings during meaningful drawing were compared with recordings where the pen was tapped and shifted on tablet without specific purpose. With reference to T0 event (pen touching tablet), several components could be observed in pre- and post-T0 epochs. The most important appeared to be a triphasic wave (N-150, P-40 and N + 30), where P-40 showed a striking difference between drawing and tap session, being much larger in the former.\nOnset of muscle EMG is usually employed for synchronization. In complex and free gestures too many muscles are active to allow reliable identification of such reference.

To effectively prevent the adverse interferences, a novel piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trfluoroethylene)(P(VDF-TrFE)) layer was designed to coat onto the indium tin oxide (ITO) planar microelectrode. We found the electrical stimulation was able to regulate the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through calcium-mediated PKC signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the surface charge of the designed P(VDF-TrFE) coating layer could be easily controlled by the pre-polarization process, which was demonstrated to trigger integrin-mediated FAK signaling pathway, finally up-regulating the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Strikingly, the crosstalk in the downstream of the two signaling cascades further strengthened the ERK pathway activation for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.

Traveling surface acoustic waves (TSAWs) produced from a slanted-finger interdigital transducer (SFIT) are used to separate the protein-loaded microparticles of different sizes via the TSAW-driven acoustic radiation force (ARF). The acoustofluidic device consists of an SFIT deposited onto a piezoelectric lithium niobate substrate and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel on top of the substrate. The TSAWs propagating on the substrate penetrate into the sample fluid flow, where the human protein-conjugated microparticles are suspended, inside the PDMS microchannel. The microparticles are subjected to the TSAW-driven ARF with varying magnitude depending on their size and thus flow along different streamlines, leading to triseparation of the proteins. In this work, we used two different-sized streptavidin-functionalized polystyrene (PS) microparticles to capture two kinds of aptamers (apt15 and aptD17.4), which were labeled with a respective biotin molecule at one end. The biotin ends of the aptamers were attached to the microparticles through streptavidin-biotin linkage, whereas the free ends of the aptamers were used to capture their target proteins of thrombin (th) and immunoglobulin E (IgE). The resultant PS-apt15-th and PS-aptD17.4-IgE complexes, as well as mCardinal2, were used for experimental demonstration of acoustofluidic triseparation of the human proteins.

Although it is generally considered that proteinase K degrades only the polymer surface, we observed the enzyme's ability to induce both surface and bulk degradation. In hydrophilic films, degradation occurs at the surface, inducing surface erosion, while for hydrophobic films, it is located inside the films, inducing bulk erosion. Accordingly, changes in the structural, morphological, mechanical, thermal and wetting properties of the film resulting from degradation vary, depending on the film's wettability. Most importantly, the degradation is gradual, so the mechanical and piezoelectric properties are retained during the degradation.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["LeaGazvoda", "BojanaVi\u0161i\u0107", "Matja\u017eSpreitzer", "MarijaVukomanovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13111719\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.01.010\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.05.040\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.07.010\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.06.051\n10.1016/j.apmt.2019.06.004\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.07.145\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.03.050\n10.3390/nano10010123\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00553\n10.1080/00150190902987871\n10.1002/polb.22345\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/8/085706\n10.1002/adma.201605048\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00170-9\n10.1021/bm0507453\n10.1021/ma301482j\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00259\n10.1038/s41428-019-0281-5\n10.1021/ma800139u\n10.2494/photopolymer.29.353\n10.1016/j.addr.2016.06.012\n10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.04.003\n10.3390/proceedings1040335\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(19980905)41:3<422::AID-JBM12>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1002/polb.22327\n10.3390/molecules26010149\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2018.02.028\n10.3389/fmats.2020.00212\n10.1143/JJAP.37.2775"}

The solution is given in the Wolfram Mathematica interactive program code, allowing the derivation of the expression of the piezoresponse both in cases of the anisotropic and isotropic elastic properties. The piezoresponse's angular dependencies are analyzed using model lithium niobate and barium titanate single crystals as examples. The validity of the isotropic approximation is verified in comparison to the fully anisotropic solution.

{"title": "Review of Hybrid Materials Based on Polyhydroxyalkanoates for Tissue Engineering Applications.", "abstract": "This review is focused on hybrid polyhydroxyalkanoate-based (PHA) biomaterials with improved physico-mechanical, chemical, and piezoelectric properties and controlled biodegradation rate for applications in bone, cartilage, nerve and skin tissue engineering. PHAs are polyesters produced by a wide range of bacteria under unbalanced growth conditions. They are biodegradable, biocompatible, and piezoelectric polymers, which make them very attractive biomaterials for various biomedical applications. As naturally derived materials, PHAs have been used for multiple cell and tissue engineering applications; however, their widespread biomedical applications are limited due to their lack of toughness, elasticity, hydrophilicity and bioactivity. The chemical structure of PHAs allows them to combine with other polymers or inorganic materials to form hybrid composites with improved structural and functional properties. Their type (films, fibers, and 3D printed scaffolds) and properties can be tailored with fabrication methods and materials used as fillers. Here, we are aiming to fill in a gap in literature, revealing an up-to-date overview of ongoing research strategies that make use of PHAs as versatile and prospective biomaterials. In this work, a systematic and detailed review of works investigating PHA-based hybrid materials with tailored properties and performance for use in tissue engineering applications is carried out.

The objective was to explore the effectiveness of using a simple and economical method to modify PVDF membranes with PTFE to enhance their anticorrosion performance, especially under highly acidic or alkaline conditions. PTFE nanoparticles (of around 200 nm in size) in nanoemulsion form were blended with PVDF at a mass ratio of PTFE:PVDF in the range of 0-0.3:1. The obtained membranes were examined to determine the effect of the added PTFE nanoparticles on the structure of the modified PVDF membranes as well as on their mechanical strength and surface characteristics. The membranes were then immersed in various concentrations of acidic or alkaline solutions for varied durations ranging from a few days up to as long as 180 days (6 months). The impacts of by the corrosive solutions on the tensile strength, surface roughness, and water flux of the membranes with different exposure times were quantified.

{"title": "Energy Solutions for Wearable Sensors: A Review.", "abstract": "Wearable sensors have gained popularity over the years since they offer constant and real-time physiological information about the human body. Wearable sensors have been applied in a variety of ways in clinical settings to monitor health conditions. These technologies require energy sources to carry out their projected functionalities. In this paper, we review the main energy sources used to power wearable sensors. These energy sources include batteries, solar cells, biofuel cells, supercapacitors, thermoelectric generators, piezoelectric and triboelectric generators, and radio frequency (RF) energy harvesters. Additionally, we discuss wireless power transfer and some hybrids of the above technologies. The advantages and drawbacks of each technology are considered along with the system components and attributes that make these devices function effectively. The objective of this review is to inform researchers about the latest developments in this field and present future research opportunities.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["GuoguangRong", "YuqiaoZheng", "MohamadSawan"], "doi": "10.3390/s21113806\n10.3390/bios10120205\n10.1038/s41587-019-0045-y\n10.1016/j.jpha.2020.08.001\n10.1039/C7LC00192D\n10.1038/s41598-020-65103-z\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.150\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.01.121\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.038483\n10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103610\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2942099\n10.1002/advs.201800880\n10.3390/s21020460\n10.1049/joe.2017.0303\n10.1002/adhm.202000779\n10.1109/TBME.2007.910679\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112038\n10.1038/nature16521\n10.1038/s41598-018-33565-x\n10.1021/acssensors.7b00051\n10.1109/memea.2018.8438787\n10.1371/journal.pone.0212943\n10.1038/s41598-018-22746-3\n10.1021/nl403860k\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.04.006\n10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.078\n10.1002/pip.3229\n10.1088/1361-6528/abeb37\n10.1016/j.matlet.2021.129461\n10.1007/s11426-020-9951-1\n10.1002/advs.202004662\n10.1021/acsami.0c19014\n10.1088/1361-6528/abcf70\n10.1039/D0TA11831A\n10.1002/chem.202004703\n10.1039/C4EE02441A\n10.1038/ncomms3761\n10.1039/C8TA10585E\n10.1145/3126568\n10.1016/j.solener.2014.12.001\n10.1002/inf2.12180\n10.1002/solr.202100020\n10.1016/j.suscom.2016.05.003\n10.1002/adfm.202008908\n10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.108719\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229507\n10.1016/S0960-1481(02)00015-0\n10.1038/s41598-018-38426-1\n10.1002/adma.201104187\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.005\n10.3390/s18061927\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.117\n10.1039/c4ee00242c\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2252526\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.177\n10.1088/1361-6463/aad270\n10.1038/s41467-020-14399-6\n10.1021/acsami.8b21716\n10.1021/acsami.0c01676\n10.1021/acsami.9b21771\n10.1021/acsami.9b16012\n10.1080/09205071.2018.1497548\n10.1109/JPROC.2013.2250891\n10.1177/1084713806296720\n10.1109/TII.2020.2967023\n10.1007/s00542-021-05212-5\n10.1109/MMM.2020.2979357\n10.1109/TAP.2019.2948521\n10.3390/en13051023\n10.1063/1.5006619\n10.1109/MCOM.2015.7120024\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.010\n10.1039/C9CC09533K\n10.1039/C6TA08358G\n10.1002/anie.201302922\n10.1021/ja211714w\n10.1002/elan.201500173\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229533\n10.1016/j.bios.2021.113107\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112909\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112907\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112805\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.084\n10.3390/bios11010016\n10.1109/JSEN.2010.2085042\n10.1002/elan.201600019\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.02.046\n10.1021/la0479307\n10.3390/mi12010074\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.02.027\n10.1038/s41378-018-0025-2\n10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012032\n10.1039/C9TA02345C\n10.1038/s41598-020-68751-3\n10.1039/c2nr31031g\n10.1039/C8EE00595H\n10.1088/1361-6641/aa68d1\n10.3390/nano9040555\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/035012\n10.3390/mi8040115\n10.1155/2019/9057293\n10.1038/s41528-018-0022-4\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2788423\n10.3390/s16071045\n10.1021/acsami.0c01331\n10.1088/2053-1591/ab1ee8\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.025\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.005\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.05.010\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.080\n10.1002/adfm.201604378\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab10e9\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.02.026\n10.1021/acsami.0c22670\n10.1021/acsnano.0c09015\n10.3390/ma14071689\n10.1016/j.energy.2016.01.055\n10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.021\n10.1063/1.2947591\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.02.008\n10.1063/1.4931428\n10.1021/jp4044573\n10.1038/srep02123\n10.1126/sciadv.1600097\n10.1021/acsami.8b01635\n10.1002/advs.201801054\n10.1007/s11277-020-07840-y\n10.1039/C9TC04696H\n10.1002/adfm.201900304\n10.1007/s10853-020-05078-4\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.205\n10.1016/j.apmt.2020.100699"}

We show that a linear model, consisting of an underdamped Langevin equation for the dynamics of the tip mass, electromechanically coupled with a capacitor and a load resistor, can accurately describe the experimental data. In particular, the theoretical model allows us to define fluctuating currents and to study the stochastic thermodynamics of the system, with focus on the distribution of the extracted work over different time intervals.

In this paper, a PENG that is based on zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) is fabricated on flexible and transparent Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The ZnO NWs were deposited on two different seed layer structures, i.e., gold (Au)/ZnO and tin-doped indium-oxide (ITO)/ZnO, using hydrothermal synthesis. Along with the structural and morphological analyses of ZnO NWs, the electrical characterization was also investigated for ZnO NWs-based flexible PENGs. In order to evaluate the suitability of the PENG device structure, the electrical output performance was studied. By applying a periodic mechanical force of 3 N, the ZnO NWs-based flexible PENG generated a maximum root mean square (RMS) voltage and average power of 2.7 V and 64 nW, respectively. Moreover, the comparison between the fabricated device performances shows that a higher electrical output can be obtained when ITO/ZnO seed layer structure is adopted.

{"title": "Low-Temperature Growth of ZnO Nanowires from Gravure-Printed ZnO Nanoparticle Seed Layers for Flexible Piezoelectric Devices.", "abstract": "Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) are excellent candidates for the fabrication of energy harvesters, mechanical sensors, and piezotronic and piezophototronic devices. In order to integrate ZnO NWs into flexible devices, low-temperature fabrication methods are required that do not damage the plastic substrate. To date, the deposition of patterned ceramic thin films on flexible substrates is a difficult task to perform under vacuum-free conditions. Printing methods to deposit functional thin films offer many advantages, such as a low cost, low temperature, high throughput, and patterning at the same stage of deposition. Among printing techniques, gravure-based techniques are among the most attractive due to their ability to produce high quality results at high speeds and perform deposition over a large area. In this paper, we explore gravure printing as a cost-effective high-quality method to deposit thin ZnO seed layers on flexible polymer substrates. For the first time, we show that by following a chemical bath deposition (CBD) process, ZnO nanowires may be grown over gravure-printed ZnO nanoparticle seed layers. Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) reveals the presence of a homogeneous distribution of Zn-polar domains in the NWs, and, by use of the data, the piezoelectric coefficient is estimated to be close to 4 pm/V. The overall results demonstrate that gravure printing is an appropriate method to deposit seed layers at a low temperature and to undertake the direct fabrication of flexible piezoelectric transducers that are based on ZnO nanowires.

{"title": "A Piezoelectric and Electromagnetic Hybrid Galloping Energy Harvester with the Magnet Embedded in the Bluff Body.", "abstract": "To meet the needs of low-power microelectronic devices for on-site self-supply energy, a galloping piezoelectric-electromagnetic energy harvester (GPEEH) is proposed. It consists of a galloping piezoelectric energy harvester (GPEH) and an electromagnetic energy harvester (EEH), which is installed inside the bluff body of the GPEH. The vibration at the end of the GPEH cantilever drives the magnet to vibrate, so that electromagnetic energy can be captured by cutting off the induced magnetic field lines. The coupling structure is a two-degree-of-freedom motion, which improves the output power of the energy harvester. Based on Hamilton's variational principle and quasi-static hypothesis, the piezoelectric-electromagnetic vibrated coupling equation is established, and the output characteristics of GPEEH are obtained by the method of numerical simulation. Using the method of numerical simulation, studies a series of parameters on the output performance. when the wind speed is 9 m/s, the effective output power of the GPEEH is compared with the classical galloping piezoelectric energy harvester (CGPEH) who is no magnet. It is found that the output power of GPEEH 121% higher than the output power of CGPEH. Finally, set up an experimental platform, and test and verify. The experimental analysis results show that the simulated output parameter curves are basically consistent with the experimental drawing curves. In addition, when the wind speed is 9 m/s, under the same parameters, the effective output power of the GPEEH is 112.5% higher than that of the CGPEH.

In this paper, to develop a novel flexible pressure sensor with high sensitivity, different poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE)-based composite membranes were fabricated, characterized and tested. To improve the \u03b2-phase crystallinity and piezoelectricity of the membranes, and for the purpose of comparison, nano ZnO particles with different concentrations (99:1, 9:1 in a weight ratio of PVDF-TrFE to ZnO) were, respectively added into PVDF-TrFE polymer acting as a nucleating agent and dielectric material. To facilitate the formation of \u03b2-phase crystal, the membranes were fabricated by electrospinning method. After the electrospinning, an annealing process was conducted to the fabricated membranes to increase the size and content of \u03b2-phase crystal. Then, the fabricated PVDF-TrFE membranes, acting as the core sensing layer, were, respectively built into multiple prototype sensors in a sandwich structure. The sensitivity of the prototype sensors was tested by an auto-clicker. The stimulation of the auto-clicker on the prototype sensors generated electrical signals, and the electrical signals were collected by a self-built testing platform powered by LabVIEW. As a result, combining the addition of ZnO nanofillers and the annealing process, a highly sensitive pressure sensor was fabricated. The optimal peak-to-peak voltage response generated from the prototype sensor was 1.788 V which shows a 75% increase compared to that of the pristine PVDF-TrFE sensor. Furthermore, a human pulse waveform was captured by a prototype sensor which exhibits tremendous prospects for application in healthcare devices.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["MingranLiu", "YangLiu", "LiminZhou"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12060602\n10.1155/2015/846487\n10.1007/s10853-009-3643-0\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.3390/mi9110580\n10.1038/srep07887\n10.1063/1.2723678\n10.3390/polym12122999\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.06.016\n10.1080/00222340902837527\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.012\n10.1002/marc.201300290\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa7245"}

{"title": "Fuzzy Logic-Based and Nondestructive Concrete Strength Evaluation Using Modified Carbon Nanotubes as a Hybrid PZT-CNT Sensor.", "abstract": "Concrete strength and factors affecting its development during early concrete curing are important research topics. Avoiding uncertain incidents during construction and in service life of structures requires an appropriate monitoring system. Therefore, numerous techniques are used to monitor the health of a structure. This paper presents a nondestructive testing technique for monitoring the strength development of concrete at early curing ages. Dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used with cementitious materials and piezoelectric (PZT) material, a PZT ceramic, owing to their properties of intra electromechanical effects and sensitivity to measure the electromechanical impedance (EMI) signatures and relevant properties related to concrete strength, such as the elastic modulus, displacement, acceleration, strength, and loading effects. Concrete compressive strength, hydration temperature, mixture ratio, and variation in data obtained from the impedance signatures using fuzzy logic were utilized in the comparative result prediction method for concrete strength. These results were calculated using a fuzzy logic-based model considering the maturity method, universal testing machine (UTM) data, and analyzed EMI data. In the study, for data acquisition, a hybrid PZT-CNT sensor and a temperature sensor (Smart Rock) were embedded in the concrete to obtain the hydration temperature history to utilize the concrete maturity method and provide data on the EMI signatures. The dynamic changes in the medium caused during the phase in the concrete strengthening process were analyzed to predict the strength development process of concrete at early curing ages. Because different parameters are considered while calculating the concrete strength, which is related to its mechanical properties, the proposed novel method considers that changes in the boundary condition occurring in the concrete paste modify the resonant frequency response of the structure. Thus, relating and analyzing this feature can help predict the concrete strength. A comprehensive comparison of the results calculated using the proposed module, maturity method, and cylindrical specimens tested using the UTM proved that it is a cost-effective and fast technique to estimate concrete strength to ensure a safe construction of reinforced cement concrete infrastructures.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["NajeebullahTareen", "JunkyeongKim", "Won-KyuKim", "SeungheePark"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14112953\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/5/055002\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.10.180\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/038\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085021\n10.3390/s17091989\n10.3151/jact.15.94\n10.1016/j.cscm.2016.03.003\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.10.079\n10.23881/idupbo.018.1-9i\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.10.006\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2003.10.002\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(154)\n10.1038/354056a0\n10.1002/adma.200305409\n10.1063/1.1776619\n10.1016/j.carbon.2004.08.015\n10.1002/adma.201103704\n10.1021/nl071909j\n10.1088/0957-4484/15/3/026\n10.1063/1.2956605\n10.1063/1.1872221\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2006.12.011\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/18/185503\n10.1155/2019/6490984\n10.6092/polito/porto/2687875\n10.5772/62497\n10.1007/s10832-004-5130-y\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.3390/mi10090559\n10.5004/dwt.2020.25148\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2001)127:2(126)\n10.1080/09349847.2012.660244"}
{"title": "Study of a Controlled Piezoelectric Damper.", "abstract": "In this work an original construction of a vibration damper controlled by means of a valve with a short time of operation lag is presented. The valve-controlling properties of the damper regulates the flow of fluid between the chambers of the damper and was constructed using piezoelectric actuators, whose characteristic feature is the possibility to change dimensions, e.g., length, under the influence of voltage. As a result, by changing voltage it is possible to control the throttle of the flow by changing the width of a gap, which influences a change of damping forces. Such a solution enables a quicker change of damping forces than in other kinds of controlled damper. Due to the obtained properties, the damper may be applied to reduce the vibrations of vehicles and machines that undergo quick-change loads. In the article, the results of experimental studies of the aforementioned damper are presented. Based on the results, dissipative characteristics were determined. Also, results of numerical studies comprising the development of a numerical model of a controlled piezoelectric damper are shown. Results of numerical studies, as well as experimental studies, are presented in the form of dissipative characteristics. Comparison of results of numerical and experimental studies confirms the possibility to apply this kind of construction in semi-active systems of vibration reduction of vehicles and machines.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["Micha\u0142Makowski", "LechKnap"], "doi": "10.3390/s21103509\n10.1080/00423114.2010.532223\n10.1155/2019/2973190\n10.1139/tcsme-2016-0063\n10.1109/mcs.2004.1316650\n10.1016/j.jsv.2007.11.045\n10.1016/j.arcontrol.2012.03.011\n10.1177/1077546318775508\n10.1177/1687814018778222\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.12.001\n10.1177/1687814018811193\n10.1016/j.apm.2017.02.035\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(1997)123:3(230)\n10.1016/S0957-4158(97)00019-6\n10.1155/2015/905731\n10.1177/1077546312472916\n10.1371/journal.pone.0249034\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/12/125011\n10.3390/app11083338\n10.1007/s12206-019-0521-9\n10.18690/978-961-286-086-8.21\n10.3390/s18092881\n10.3390/s20010222\n10.1007/978-3-319-96598-7_19\n10.1007/s12206-020-0627-0\n10.1016/j.acme.2018.11.002"}
{"title": "Recent Advances in Transducers for Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) Imaging.", "abstract": "As a well-known medical imaging methodology, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging plays a critical role in diagnosis, treatment guidance and post-treatment assessment of coronary artery diseases. By cannulating a miniature ultrasound transducer mounted catheter into an artery, the vessel lumen opening, vessel wall morphology and other associated blood and vessel properties can be precisely assessed in IVUS imaging. Ultrasound transducer, as the key component of an IVUS system, is critical in determining the IVUS imaging performance. In recent years, a wide range of achievements in ultrasound transducers have been reported for IVUS imaging applications. Herein, a comprehensive review is given on recent advances in ultrasound transducers for IVUS imaging. Firstly, a fundamental understanding of IVUS imaging principle, evaluation parameters and IVUS catheter are summarized. Secondly, three different types of ultrasound transducers (piezoelectric ultrasound transducer, piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer and capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer) for IVUS imaging are presented. Particularly, the recent advances in piezoelectric ultrasound transducer for IVUS imaging are extensively examined according to their different working mechanisms, configurations and materials adopted.

{"title": "Self-Powered Smart Beehive Monitoring and Control System (SBMaCS).", "abstract": "Beekeeping in Africa has been practiced for many years through successive generations and along inherited patterns. Beekeepers continue to face challenges in accessing consistent and business-driven markets for their bee products. In addition, the honeybee populations are decreasing due to colony collapse disorder (CCD), fire, loss of bees in swarming, honey buggers and other animals, moths, starvation, cold weather, and Varoa mites. The main issues are related to un-controlled temperature, humidity, and traditional management of beekeeping. These challenges result in low production of honey and colony losses. The control of the environmental conditions within and surrounding the beehives are not available to beekeepers due to the lack of monitoring systems. A Smart Beehive System using Internet of Things (IoT) technology would allow beekeepers to keep track of the amount of honey created in their hives and bee colonies even when they are far from their hives, through mobile phones, which would curtail the challenges currently faced by the beekeepers. However, there are challenges in the design of energy-efficient embedded electronic devices for IoT. A promising solution is to provide energy autonomy to the IoT nodes that will harvest residual energy from ambient sources, such as motion, vibrations, light, or heat. This paper proposes a Self-Powered Smart Beehive Monitoring and Control System (SBMaCS) using IoT to support remote follow-up and control, enhancing bee colonies' security and thus increasing the honey productivity. First, we develop the SBMaCS hardware prototype interconnecting various sensors, such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, piezoelectric transducer-which will work as a weight sensor-motion sensor, and flame sensor. Second, we introduce energy harvesting models to self-power the SBMaCS by analyzing the (i) energy harvested from adult bees' vibrations, (ii) energy harvesting through the piezoelectric transducer, and (iii) radio frequency energy harvesting. Third, we develop a mobile phone application that interacts with the SBMaCS hardware to monitor and control the various parameters related to the beehives. Finally, the SBMaCS PCB layout is also designed. SBMaCS will help beekeepers to successfully monitor and control some important smart beekeeping activities wherever they are using their mobile phone application.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["EliasNtawuzumunsi", "SanthiKumaran", "LouisSibomana"], "doi": "10.3390/s21103522\n10.1080/00218839.1985.11100668\n10.1126/science.1230200\n10.1111/gec3.12266\n10.1016/j.egypro.2017.05.012\n10.1051/apido:2005027\n10.1098/rsbl.2012.0367\n10.1007/BF02977841\n10.1016/j.jep.2004.06.016\n10.1016/j.jretai.2016.12.002\n10.1515/9783110812060.217\n10.1177/0583102406061499\n10.1111/1365-2664.12385\n10.1099/0022-1317-63-1-171\n10.3390/v7062765\n10.1111/brv.12065\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/9/095016\n10.1242/jeb.01958\n10.4039/Ent92941-12\n10.1109/8.817654\n10.1109/icsens.2015.7370561\n10.1016/j.enconman.2009.02.020\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa7bfb\n10.3390/s16091502\n10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2213069\n10.1166/jnn.2013.8106\n10.1109/TPEL.2003.809379\n10.1109/TPEL.2007.904230"}
{"title": "Fatigue Crack Monitoring of T-Type Joints in Steel Offshore Oil and Gas Jacket Platform.", "abstract": "Several approaches have been used in the past to predict fatigue crack growth rates in T-joints of the offshore structures, but there are relatively few cases of applying structural health monitoring during the non-destructive testing of jacket platforms. This paper presents an experimental method based on the sensing of the piezoelectric sensors and finite element analysis method for studying the fatigue cracks in the offshore steel jacket structure. Three types of joints are selected in the current research work: T-type plate, T-type tube-plate, and T-type tube joints. The finite element analysis model established in the current study computes and analyzes the high stress and high strain regions in the T-type joints. The fatigue damage in the T-type joints was successfully detected by utilizing both the finite element analysis and experimental methods. The results showed that fatigue cracks of the three types of joints are prone to appear at the weld toe and spread in the welding direction. The fatigue damage location of T-type plate and T-type tube-plate joints is more concentrated in the upper weld toe area, and the fatigue damage location of the T-type tube joint is closer to the lower weld toe area.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["LiaqatAli", "SikandarKhan", "SalemBashmal", "NaveedIqbal", "WeishunDai", "YongBai"], "doi": "10.3390/s21093294\n10.1016/j.oceaneng.2013.09.012\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2008.09.006\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2018.09.016\n10.1016/j.jcsr.2005.02.005\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2004.11.004\n10.1016/j.ress.2012.06.011\n10.1016/S0951-8339(01)00030-2\n10.1016/S0167-4730(98)00005-8\n10.1016/j.tws.2004.03.024\n10.1016/j.tws.2004.07.010\n10.1016/j.oceaneng.2012.09.019\n10.1680/jmaen.2019.172.1.1\n10.1177/0309524X18776677\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2019.105327\n10.1016/j.prostr.2019.08.010\n10.1016/j.renene.2016.01.010\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.03.055\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2019.105185\n10.1177/0309524X18777322\n10.1115/1.4042946\n10.1680/jmaen.2020.2\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.07.038\n10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000533\n10.3390/en13205494\n10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0680(2009)14:2(63)\n10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000148\n10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000157\n10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000184\n10.1115/1.2904584\n10.17736/ijope.2020.jc762\n10.1111/ffe.13195\n10.1080/17445302.2011.627750\n10.1016/j.tws.2012.04.011\n10.1177/1687814019870395\n10.1115/pvp2018-85156\n10.1115/1.4005188\n10.3390/jmse8100778\n10.1016/j.jcsr.2006.06.007\n10.1016/0951-8339(88)90009-3\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1994)120:5(1624)\n10.1016/0951-8320(95)00123-9\n10.1016/S0142-1123(03)00021-5\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1016/j.firesaf.2012.10.008\n10.1016/j.engfailanal.2008.09.016\n10.1515/adms-2016-0003\n10.3390/met8030169\n10.1515/adms-2016-0010\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2017.02.023\n10.1063/1.5042935\n10.1515/adms-2017-0036\n10.1007/s00170-020-05617-y\n10.1179/1362171815y.0000000089\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2016.11.002\n10.1515/pomr-2017-0038\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.11.010\n10.1007/s13632-017-0376-3\n10.1515/adms-2015-0015\n10.1080/09507110903464820\n10.1177/0954405416661002\n10.1016/j.matdes.2011.03.049\n10.1007/s40799-016-0058-0\n10.1007/s40799-016-0134-5\n10.1007/s12665-016-6122-3\n10.1016/j.jcou.2020.101361\n10.1504/IJGW.2018.091532\n10.1016/j.jece.2020.104756\n10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000893\n10.1007/s12665-018-7610-4\n10.1080/17445302.2020.1747751\n10.1115/OMAE2020-19283\n10.1080/17445302.2020.1834268\n10.1155/2020/8841795\n10.1139/tcsme-2017-520"}
{"title": "Fabrication of Pressure Sensor Using Electrospinning Method for Robotic Tactile Sensing Application.", "abstract": "Tactile sensors are widely used by the robotics industries over decades to measure force or pressure produced by external stimuli. Piezoelectric-based pressure sensors have intensively been investigated as promising candidates for tactile sensing applications. In contrast, piezoelectric-based pressure sensors are expensive due to their high cost of manufacturing and expensive base materials. Recently, an effect similar to the piezoelectric effect has been identified in non-piezoelectric polymers such as poly(d,l-lactic acid (PDLLA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene. Hence investigations were conducted on alternative materials to find their suitability. In this article, we used inexpensive atactic polystyrene (aPS) as the base polymer and fabricated functional fibers using an electrospinning method. Fiber morphologies were studied using a field-emission scanning electron microscope and proposed a unique pressure sensor fabrication method. A fabricated pressure sensor was subjected to different pressures and corresponding electrical and mechanical characteristics were analyzed. An open circuit voltage of 3.1 V was generated at 19.9 kPa applied pressure, followed by an integral output charge (\u0394", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["Tamil SelvanRamadoss", "YuyaIshii", "AmuthaChinnappan", "Marcelo HAng", "SeeramRamakrishna"], "doi": "10.3390/nano11051320\n10.1115/1.4029493\n10.1109/ICAR.2013.6766525\n10.1109/MRA.2014.2310152\n10.1126/scirobotics.aat0429\n10.1002/adma.201901408\n10.1002/aisy.201900051\n10.1109/LRA.2019.2899192\n10.1016/j.measurement.2012.11.015\n10.1038/ncomms9011\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.04.043\n10.1039/C9NR02802A\n10.1063/1.5140213\n10.1002/marc.202000218\n10.1038/s41427-018-0041-6\n10.1142/S0219581X1950008X\n10.1142/S1793292020500496\n10.1063/1.5126777\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1238723\n10.3390/s131114777\n10.1142/S1793292020500071.t\n10.7567/JJAP.57.05GC06\n10.1002/mame.201700302\n10.11591/eei.v8i1.1019\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab2e3a\n10.1088/0957-4484/26/26/265402"}

The dispersion and stability of MWCNT non-covalent functionalized with PEG were all improved. TEM characterization and XPS quantitative analysis proved that the use of PEG to non-covalent functionalize MWCNT was successful. SEM image analysis confirmed that the pore size of PEG-MWCNT membrane was more concentrated and distributed in a narrower range of diameter. Contact angle measurement demonstrated that PEG non-covalent functionalization greatly enhanced the hydrophilicity of MWCNT membranes. The results of pure water flux showed that the PEG-MWCNT membranes could be categorized into low pressure membrane. PEG-MWCNT membrane had a better effect on the removal of humic acid (HA) and a lower TMP growth rate compared with a commercial 0.01-\u03bcm PVDF ultrafiltration membrane. During the filtration of bovine serum albumin (BSA), the antifouling ability of PEG-MWCNT membranes were obviously better than the raw MWCNT membranes.

{"title": "Cement-Based Piezoelectric Ceramic Composites for Sensing Elements: A Comprehensive State-of-the-Art Review.", "abstract": "Compatibility, a critical issue between sensing material and host structure, significantly influences the detecting performance (e.g., sensitive, signal-to-noise ratio) of the embedded sensor. To address this issue in concrete-based infrastructural health monitoring, cement-based piezoelectric composites (piezoelectric ceramic particles as a function phase and cementitious materials as a matrix) have attracted continuous attention in the past two decades, dramatically exhibiting superior durability, sensitivity, and compatibility. This review paper performs a synthetical overview of recent advances in theoretical analysis, characterization and simulation, materials selection, the fabrication process, and application of the cement-based piezoelectric composites.

However, there is still a demand for effective storage devices to conserve electrical energy which addresses the wide range of large stationary applications from electric vehicles to small portable devices. Among the large variety of energy-storage systems available today, electrochemical energy sources and, in particular, supercapacitors (SC), are rather promising in terms of cost, scaling, power management, life cycle and safety. Therefore, this review surveys recent achievements in the development of SC based on composites of such carbon-derived materials as graphene (G) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with carbon nanotubes (CNT).

{"title": "Fabrication and Characterization of a Microscale Piezoelectric Vibrator Based on Electrohydrodynamic Jet Printed PZT Thick Film.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel way of preparing a PZT thick film micro vibrator using the electrohydrodynamic jet (E-Jet) printing technique. Initially, a micro piezoelectric vibrator was simulated and designed for obtaining optimized structure, which has a total thickness of less than 600 \u00b5m. Subsequently, the PZT thick film element was directly printed on the elastic body using the E-Jet printing. This method avoids the glue fabrication process involved in the bulk piezoelectric fabrication, thus avoiding the limits of voltage drops, isolating and absorbing amplitude usually occurred in the vibrator having glue interface. It was observed that B02 and B03 modes were generated at frequencies of 29.74 and 79.14 kHz, respectively, and the amplitudes of B02 and B03 modes were 406 and 176 nm, respectively. The error between the simulation and test result in the B03 modal is only 0.35%, which indicates the accuracy of the simulation analysis and the fabrication process. The PZT thick film traveling-wave micro vibrator successfully realized bidirectional rotation of a rotor, with a maximum speed of 681 rpm, which also shows a linear relationship between excitation voltage and rotary speed.

{"title": "Impact of Boundary Conditions on the Behavior of Thin-Walled Laminated Angle Column under Uniform Shortening.", "abstract": "Determining the appropriate boundary conditions of a structure is a very important aspect in the failure analysis. In experimental tests, the method of compressing composite samples significantly influences the obtained results. In numerical studies, there is a problem of correctly defining the boundary conditions applied in real object. Therefore, many numerical tests on samples should be undertaken to observe their behavior and to determine ultimate load. The present work includes study to determine the impact of boundary conditions on the thin-walled laminated angle column under compression. The phenomenon of buckling and the post-buckling bahavior of columns were investigated experimentally and numerically. First, the real simply supported angle columns subjected to uniform shortening are tested. Due to the stress concentration between the real sample and the grips, a flexible pads were used. Experimental tests are carried out on the universal testing machine. The deformations of columns were measured using the non-contact Aramis System. The composite material condition was monitored by acoustic emission using the Vallen Systeme with piezoelectric sensors. Next, the numerical calculations in Abaqus software based on the finite element method are performed to validate the empirical results. To determine the influence of the boundary conditions, two numerical models of the system with and without flexible pads are developed. To estimate damage initiation load in numerical models a different damage criteria ( Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu, Azzi-Tsai-Hill, Hashin) are used. Based on the results specified that the model with elastic pads more accurately reflects the actual behavior of the L-profile element under compression. It was supported, i.e. by good agreement of flanges deflection (the equilibrium paths) with experimental results. Furthermore, a qualitative and quantitative agreement of damage initiation load were obtained using Hashin criteria (error 4.61%).", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-06-03", "authors": ["Jaros\u0142awGawryluk"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14112732\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.04.035\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2009.12.006\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.05.067\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.08.076\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.11.008\n10.1016/j.proeng.2013.12.128\n10.2514/1.J053007\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2007.01.017\n10.1016/j.tws.2020.106951\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.10.035\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2014.07.033\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.08.023\n10.1016/j.tws.2014.09.010\n10.2478/s13531-011-0005-x\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2006.01.028\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.07.068\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.07.040\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112356\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.01.009\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112430\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.114046"}

This paper studies the mechanical and electrical properties of functionally graded flexo-piezoelectric beams under different electrical boundary conditions. The generalized variational principle and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory are employed to deduce the governing equations and corresponding electro-mechanical boundary conditions of the beam model. The deflection and induced electric potential are given as analytical expressions for the functionally graded cantilever beam. The numerical results show that the flexoelectric effect, piezoelectric effect, and gradient distribution have considerable influences on the electro-mechanical performance of the functionally graded beams. Moreover, the nonuniform piezoelectricity and polarization direction will play a leading role in the induced electric potential at a large scale. The flexoelectric effect will dominate the induced electric potential as the beam thickness decreases.

For that high temperature ultrasonic transducers are necessary. In the presented paper, a literature review on the main types of such transducers, piezoelectric materials, backings, and the bonding techniques of transducers elements suitable for high temperatures, is presented. In this review, the main focus is on ultrasonic transducers with piezoelectric elements suitable for operation at temperatures higher than of the most commercially available transducers, i.e., 150 \u00b0C. The main types of the ultrasonic transducers that are discussed are the transducers with thin protectors, which may serve as matching layers, transducers with high temperature delay lines, wedges, and waveguide type transducers. The piezoelectric materials suitable for high temperature applications such as aluminum nitride, lithium niobate, gallium orthophosphate, bismuth titanate, oxyborate crystals, lead metaniobate, and other piezoceramics are analyzed. Bonding techniques used for joining of the transducer elements such as joining with glue, soldering, brazing, dry contact, and diffusion bonding are discussed.

Here, a material platform capable of transducing mechanical stimuli into visual readout is presented. The material layer comprises a mixture of an ionic transition metal complex luminophore and an ionic liquid (capable of producing electrochemiluminescence (ECL)) within a thermoplastic polyurethane matrix. The proposed material platform shows visco-poroelastic response to mechanical stress, which induces a change in the distribution of the ionic luminophore in the film, which is referred to as the piezo-ionic effect. This piezo-ionic effect is exploited to develop a simple device containing the composite layer sandwiched between two electrodes, which is termed \"ECL skin\". Emission from the ECL skin is examined, which increases with the applied normal/tensile stress. Additionally, locally applied stress to the ECL skin is spatially resolved and visualized without the use of spatially distributed arrays of pressure sensors.

{"title": "Electromechanical impedance based self-diagnosis of piezoelectric smart structure using principal component analysis and LibSVM.", "abstract": "The long-term use of a piezoelectric smart structure make it difficult to judge whether the structure or piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is damaged when the signal changes. If the sensor fault occurs, the cases and degrees of the fault are unknown based on the electromechanical impedance method. Therefore, after the principal component analysis (PCA) of six characteristic indexes, a two-component solution that could explain 99.2% of the variance in the original indexes was obtained to judge whether the damage comes from the PZT. Then LibSVM was used to make an effective identification of four sensor faults (pseudo soldering, debonding, wear, and breakage) and their three damage degrees. The result shows that the identification accuracy of damaged PZT reached 97.5%.

By comparing the scores of the samples under unknown conditions with the set threshold, whether the sensor faults occur is effectively judged; the intact and 12 possible damage states of PZT can be all classified correctly with the model trained by LibSVM.

Here, we share the protocol for building a perfusion tool to enable rapid chemical modification of glutamate-gated AMPA receptors, optimized for their fast activation. This system can be used to perform state-dependent crosslinking in receptors modified by cysteines or UAA incorporation on the millisecond timescale. Introducing UAAs results in receptors with lower expression levels relative to the introduction of cysteine residues. Reduced expression is principally a challenge for biochemical studies, and we share here our approach to capture the light driven oligomerization of AMPA receptors containing UAA crosslinkers.

The free-standing Zn anode precursor is formed by mixing Zn particles with carbon nanotubes and poly(vinylidene fluoride)-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP). The hexafluoropropylene group in PVDF-HFP improves the mechanical properties of the free-standing Zn anode, whereas the carbon nanotubes created percolation conduction in the composite electrode, leading to an increased electrical conductivity of the anode. Owing to the excellent electrical conductivity and high specific surface area of the free-standing Zn anode, ZIBs with high capacity, rate performance, and mechanical flexibility are achieved.

{"title": "Suppression of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Development by Mechanosensitive Protein Piezo1 Downregulation.", "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a malignant epithelial cancer of the esophageal epithelium. Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1), an essential mechanosensitive protein, plays an important role in maintaining cell biological functions under the stimulation of physiological force. Immunohistochemical and bioinformatic analyses of ESCC tissue samples indicate that Piezo1 expression is higher in ESCC tissues than in paracancerous tissues. shRNA-mediated Piezo1 downregulation in the ESCC lines EC9706 and EC109 showed that proliferation, migration, and invasion were suppressed by Piezo1 knockdown. Piezo1 downregulation suppresses ESCC migration and invasion in both cells and tissues via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway. Moreover, G0/G1 to S-phase cell cycle progression was inhibited, and cell apoptosis was induced by Piezo1 downregulation. Furthermore, we observed an interaction between Piezo1 and p53 using immunoprecipitation. The protein levels of p53, downstream factor Bax, apoptosis executioner cleaved-caspase3, and caspase3 were significantly upregulated by the downregulation of Piezo1. The inhibited growth rate and upregulated expression of these related factors were validated using tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, Piezo1 downregulation induces ESCC apoptosis via a Piezo1-p53-Bax-Caspase 3 axis.

This experimental study reports on additive manufacturing and quasi-static mechanical testing of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and in-vitro cytocompatible polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) specimens that were 3D printed with different infill patterns at 75% density (linear, cubic, cross, concentric, octet, zigzag, triangular). Recommendations are provided for addressing issues related to weak adhesion and obtrusive warping, which occur in open-chamber FFF printer due to semi-crystalline and hydrophobic nature of PVDF-based thermoplastics. The measured tensile and flexural stress-strain curves are analyzed to determine the influence of strut-based infills on the strength and elastic performance by including comparisons in ratios between strength, modulus of elasticity and weight of the specimens. The concentric pattern demonstrates the highest tensile strength, while the cross and triangular lattices - the lowest one. In three-point bending, the linear pattern delivers the lowest strength, while the rest exhibit comparable mechanical properties.

Both the electromechanical impedance (EMI) of the surface bonded PWaT and the ultrasound pitch-catch signal have been studied extensively for damage detection. However, these two signals were studied separately. The correlation between the EMI and the pitch-catch signal has not been studied in detail. In this paper, a broadband spectral analysis method is presented to analyze the influence of the EMI resonances on the fundamental symmetric (S0) pitch-catch signal. First, the broadband responses of the PWaT actuator and sensor are measured and analyzed in the time-frequency domain. The results clearly demonstrate that the S0 pitch-catch signal can deviate significantly from the excitation signal when the excitation frequency is above a threshold. Next, a simulation model was implemented to explain the observed distortions. The simulation model was first validated by adjusting the adhesive parameters to reproduce the experiment measurements. The resonant characteristics of the PWaT actuator and sensor were then analyzed separately. The study reveals that the S0 deviations are due to the resonances and anti-resonances of the PWaT EMI. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the resonance characteristics of surface-bonded PWaTs are more complicated than previously known.

Here, we propose an interface sensor to detect noncontact proximity and contact pressure between wearable sensors and human skin. The interface sensor employs natural piezo-thermic transduction of human skin and enables direct interfacial proximity/pressure detection by using simple thin-film thermistors to detect the interfacial thermal field change. We develop a wearable watch-type heart rate (HR) monitor utilizing interface sensors to remove MA for a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor through adaptive filtering. To validate the method, we conduct experiments for multiple subjects, who carry out HR monitoring using the wearable device while doing various physical exercises. The PPG-based HR estimations are corrected through MA removal using interface sensors and compared with that using conventional accelerometer-based MA removal. The experimental results verify that the interface sensors capture the interfacial dynamic change between the PPG sensor and skin better, and obtain more accurate HR estimations during irregular and muscle strength exercises.

The clinical evaluation of this problem involves an invasive screening, whose results are subjective and do not provide a precise and quantitative assessment. To overcome these issues, alternative possibilities based on wearable technologies have been proposed. We explore the use of ultrathin, compliant, and flexible piezoelectric patches that are able to convert the laryngeal movement into a well-defined electrical signal, with extremely low anatomical obstruction and high strain resolution. The sensor is based on an aluminum nitride thin film, grown on a soft Kapton substrate, integrated with an electrical charge amplifier and low-power, wireless connection to a smartphone. An ad-hoc designed laryngeal motion simulator (LMS), which is able to mimic the motions of the laryngeal prominence, was used to evaluate its performances.

Because they are analytical devices, they can detect both quantitative and qualitative biological components through the generation of detectable signals. In the recent past, biosensors witnessed significant changes and developments in their design as well as features. Nanotechnology has revolutionized sensing phenomena by increasing biodiagnostic capacity in terms of specificity, size, and cost, resulting in exceptional sensitivity and flexibility. The steep increase of non-communicable diseases across the world has emerged as a matter of concern. In parallel, the abrupt outbreak of communicable diseases poses a serious threat to mankind. For decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with various communicable and non-communicable diseases, early detection and subsequent treatment are indispensable. Detection of different biological markers generates quantifiable signals that can be electrochemical, mass-based, optical, thermal, or piezoelectric. Speculating on the incumbent applicability and versatility of nano-biosensors in large disciplines, this review highlights different types of biosensors along with their components and detection mechanisms.

{"title": "Construction and Piezoelectric Properties of a Single-Peptide Nanotube Composed of Cyclic \u03b2-peptides with Helical Peptides on the Side Chains.", "abstract": "To develop nanopiezoelectronics, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between the sizes and piezoelectric properties of the material. Peptide nanotubes (PNTs) composed of cyclic \u03b2-peptides have been studied as leading candidates for nanopiezoelectric materials. The current drawback of PNTs is aggregation to form a PNT bundle structure due to strong dipole-dipole interactions between PNTs. Here, we report the construction and piezoelectric properties of single PNTs without nonspecific aggregation by side-chain modification of helical peptides. A cyclic tri-\u03b2-peptide with a helical peptide was prepared by multiple-step liquid-phase peptide synthesis and assembled into PNTs by the vapor diffusion method. These nanotubes were characterized by polarized light microscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Additionally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographic images showed nanotubes with a height of 4 nm, which corresponds to the diameter of a PNT on a gold-coated mica substrate, indicating that a single PNT was prepared successfully. The converted piezoelectric response of a single PNT was determined to be 1.39 \u00b1 0.12 pm/V. This value was consistent with that of a PNT bundle, which reveals that the piezoelectricity of PNTs is induced by deformation of their cyclic skeletons and is independent of the bundled structure. This finding not only demonstrates a new molecular design strategy to construct these smallest piezoelectric biomaterials by controlling the supramolecular hierarchical structures but also provides insights into the correlation between molecular assembly morphology and size-dependent piezoelectric properties.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2021-05-19", "authors": ["TaichiKurita", "TomoakiTerabayashi", "ShunsakuKimura", "KeijiNumata", "HirotakaUji"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.biomac.1c00213"}
{"title": "Numerical study on sector-vortex phased irradiation method using annular array transducer in High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound treatment.", "abstract": "Sector-vortex phased irradiation from annular array transducer was numerically studied with breast model constructed from MRI data of real patient. Phase compensation (PC) based on time reversal pre-computation was applied in order to handle phase delay caused by heterogeneity of breast tissues, and results showed great effectiveness on single-focus case, insignificant effectiveness on multi-focus cases with 4 and 8 phase-sectors, but ineffectiveness on multi-focus case with 12 phase-sectors, where enormous undesired outer ablation occurred. For single-focus case, phase compensation not only produced real focus very close to targeted site (0.1\u00a0mm deviation), but also decreased thermal peak ratio (outer/focal) largely by 30%. However, phase compensation did not increase total ablated size. For multi-focus cases with 4 and 8 phase-sectors, deformed focal shapes by tissue heterogeneity were restored by phase compensation, but the 4-phase-sector case had higher thermal peak ratio and smaller ablation than 8-phase-sector case for strong cancelling effect between phase-sector borders. Ineffectiveness of phase compensation on multi-focus case with 12 phase-sectors had three considerable reasons. 1st, inequality of piezo-element number between sectors; 2nd, heterogeneous attenuation of breast model; 3rd, insufficient number of piezo-elements per sector; where the 2nd reason originated from breast model, and other two reasons were related to array transducer. This research gave several preliminary indications. 1st, ineffectiveness of phase compensation occurs on case with large phase-sector number when using annular array transducer; 2nd, with same input energy and same irradiation time, sector-vortex phased irradiation creates smaller focal ablation, but withstands longer than single-focus irradiation free of outer ablation; 3rd, phase-difference \u03c0 between neighboring phase-sectors is disadvantageous because of energy loss; 4th, phase compensation is effective on single-focus for improving pinpoint ablation but not for increasing total ablated size.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-05-18", "authors": ["MingzhenZhang", "RyutaNarumi", "TakashiAzuma", "KoheiOkita", "ShuTakagi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106464"}

Since specific antiviral treatments have not been developed yet and its fatal rate is almost high, early and fast detection is critical for controlling the outbreak. In this study, a piezoelectric microcantilever biosensor has been designed for detecting COVID-19 samples directly without requiring preparation steps. The biosensor acts as a transducer and is coated with the related antibody. When the SARS-CoV-2 antigens adsorbed on the microcantilever top surface through their spike proteins, a surface stress due to the mass change would be prompted leading to the measurable tip deflection and floating voltage. To obtain a biosensor with optimum parameters, different shapes and piezoelectric materials have been assessed and it was concluded that a Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) biosensor in a shape of a holed punched form triangle, represented the best result.

Although they have been successfully employed in bulk materials, they have not been effective in thin films due to the severe deterioration in epitaxy, which is critical to film properties. Contending with the opposing effects of alloying and epitaxy in thin films has been a long-standing issue. Herein we demonstrate a new strategy in alkali niobate epitaxial films, utilizing alkali vacancies without alloying to form nanopillars enclosed with out-of-phase boundaries that can give rise to a giant electromechanical response. Both atomically resolved polarization mapping and phase field simulations show that the boundaries are strained and charged, manifesting as head-head and tail-tail polarization bound charges. Such charged boundaries produce a giant local depolarization field, which facilitates a steady polarization rotation between the matrix and nanopillars.

{"title": "Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics of Diphenylalanine Amyloid Peptides in Electric Fields.", "abstract": "The self-assembling propensity of amyloid peptides such as diphenylalanine (FF) allows them to form ordered, nanoscale structures, with biocompatible properties important for biomedical applications. Moreover, piezoelectric properties allow FF molecules and their aggregates (e.g., FF nanotubes) to be aligned in a controlled way by the application of external electric fields. However, while the behavior of FF nanostructures emerges from the biophysical properties of the monomers, the detailed responses of individual peptides to both temperature and electric fields are not fully understood. Here, we study the temperature-dependent conformational dynamics of FF peptides solvated in explicit water molecules, an environment relevant to biomedical applications, by using an enhanced sampling method, replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), in conjunction with applied electric fields. Our simulations highlight and overcome possible artifacts that may occur during the setup of REMD simulations of explicitly solvated peptides in the presence of external electric fields, a problem particularly important in the case of short peptides such as FF. The presence of the external fields could overstabilize certain conformational states in one or more REMD replicas, leading to distortions of the underlying potential energy distributions observed at each temperature. This can be overcome by correcting the REMD initial conditions to include the lower-energy conformations induced by the external field.

{"title": "Aging of PVDF and PES ultrafiltration membranes by sodium hypochlorite: Effect of solution pH.", "abstract": "Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) is a commonly applied cleaning agent for ultrafiltration membranes in water and wastewater treatment. Long-term exposure to NaClO might change the properties and performance of polymeric membranes, and ultimately shorten membrane lifespan. Active species in NaClO solution vary with solution pH, and the aging effects can change depending on the membrane material. In this study, the aging of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes by NaClO at pH 3-11 was investigated by examining variations in chemical composition, surface charge, surface morphology, mechanical strength, permeability, and retention ability. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which was blended in both membranes, was oxidized and dislodged due to NaClO aging at all investigated pH values, but the oxidation products and dislodgement ratio of PVP varied with solution pH. For the PVDF membrane, NaClO aging at pH 3-11 caused a moderate increase in permeability and decreased retention due to the oxidation and release of PVP. The tensile strength decreased only at pH 11 because of the defluorination of PVDF molecules. For the PES membrane, NaClO aging at all investigated pH resulted in chain scission of PES molecules, which was favored at pH 7 and 9, potentially due to the formation of free radicals. Therefore, a decrease in tensile strength and retention ability, as well as an increase in permeability, occurred in the PES membrane for NaClO aging at pH 3-11. Overall, the results can provide a basis for selecting chemical cleaning conditions for PVDF and PES membranes.", "journal": "Journal of environmental sciences (China)", "date": "2021-05-15", "authors": ["KaiLi", "QianSu", "ShuLi", "GangWen", "TinglinHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jes.2020.12.020"}

Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with crystallographic computing reveals a crystal structure comprising hollandite and pyrolusite units sharing the edges of their MnO6 octahedra, resulting in three types of tunnels arranged along the c axis, where the ordering of the Sr atoms produces natural symmetry breaking. The novel structure gives rise to ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity, as revealed by local direct piezoelectric force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the ferroelectric nature of the SMO nanowire thin films at room temperature and showed a piezoelectric coefficient d33 value of 22 \u00b1 6 pC N-1. Moreover, we proved that flexible vertical SMO nanowires can be harvested providing an electrical output energy through the piezoelectric effect, showing excellent deformability and high interface recombination.

The study used a total of 39 dental implants, representing three different surface textures. The implants were divided into 13 groups with one of each of the three surface textures in a group. A standardized amount of modified resin dental cement was applied to the implant surface. Each test instrument was used as a monotherapy. Additionally, three of the lasers were used as part of a dual therapy in conjunction with the piezo ultrasonic scaler. Laser irradiation was limited to 2 minutes. Following treatment, implants were graded visually and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the presence of unremoved cement and concomitant damage, if any, to the implant surface. The results showed that no treatment removed all residual cement from any of the three implant surfaces, although specific protocols appeared more effective than others.

ICSI uses micropipettes with a spiking tip to penetrate the zona pellucida and membrane. Then, the cytoplasm is usually aspirated into the micropipette for membrane breakage (conventional-ICSI). The survival and fertilization rates of mouse oocytes after conventional-ICSI were as low as 16% and 8%, respectively. Kimura and Yanagimachi applied a piezo drive unit, mercury, and a micropipette with a flat tip for mouse ICSI.

Protein digestion and subsequent sample processing steps are efficiently performed in 96-well polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane plate allowing for the use of vacuum manifolds for rapid liquid transfer, and multichannel pipettes and/or liquid handing robots. In this chapter we make available a detailed step-by-step protocol for our 'MStern blotting' sample processing strategy applied to patient urine samples followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. Subsequently, we provide an example application using minimal volume of urine samples (e.g. 150\u00a0\u03bcL) collected from children pre and post thoracotomy to identify the predominant sites of protein catabolism and aid in the design of therapies to ameliorate protein catabolism and breakdown during critical illness. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the systemic state is reflected in the urine as an easily obtainable, stable, and safe biofluid.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2021-05-08", "authors": ["SaimaAhmed", "BenoitFatou", "Nilesh MMehta", "Tue BBennike", "HannoSteen"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-63908-2_1\n10.1002/pmic.200401063\n10.1038/nmeth.1322\n10.1016/j.jprot.2017.06.019\n10.1021/ac5008317\n10.1371/journal.pone.0175967\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7057-5_27\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00111\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00826\n10.1074/mcp.O115.049650\n10.1097/MCC.0b013e3283514ba7\n10.1177/0148607109333114\n10.1177/0148607108316196\n10.1056/NEJMoa1011802\n10.1074/mcp.M113.031591\n10.1016/j.euprot.2015.10.001\n10.1021/pr500587x\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00598\n10.1021/pr101065j\n10.1038/nbt.1511\n10.1038/nmeth.3901\n10.1016/j.pcl.2009.06.007\n10.1097/00003246-199504000-00011"}

The self-healing piezoelectric composite and self-healing Ag NW electrode fabricated through mixing piezoelectric PZT particles and conductive Ag NWs into self-healing polydimethylsiloxane (H-PDMS) are assembled into the sandwich structure FS-PENG. The FS-PENG could not only effectively convert external stimulation into electrical signals with a linear response to the pressure but also retain the excellent self-healing and stable sensing property after multiple cycles of cutting and self-healing process. Moreover, a self-healing pressure sensor array composed of 9 FS-PENGs was attached on the back of the human hand to mimic the human skin, and accurate monitoring of the spatial position distribution and magnitude of the pressure was successfully realized.", "journal": "Research (Washington, D.C.)", "date": "2021-05-08", "authors": ["MaosenYang", "JinmeiLiu", "DongLiu", "JingyiJiao", "NuanyangCui", "ShuhaiLiu", "QiXu", "LongGu", "YongQin"], "doi": "10.34133/2021/9793458\n10.1002/adma.201102958\n10.1016/j.nantod.2013.11.002\n10.1021/nn404614z\n10.1002/adma.201705918\n10.1021/acsnano.8b01534\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1038/nature13792\n10.1038/s41467-019-09461-x\n10.1016/j.mattod.2016.12.001\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.01.004\n10.1002/adfm.201604378\n10.1002/adfm.201908724\n10.1126/sciadv.aba9624\n10.1126/sciadv.1700015\n10.1002/advs.202000186\n10.1038/srep03138\n10.1002/adma.201702181\n10.1021/acsnano.8b02479\n10.1126/sciadv.abb4246\n10.1021/acsami.0c08213\n10.1021/acsami.0c07037\n10.1002/adfm.201910723\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2013.07.012\n10.1002/adfm.201807655\n10.1002/adem.201700275\n10.1002/adma.201803968\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.091\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103857\n10.1038/s41467-020-14846-4\n10.1002/adma.201402868\n10.1021/nl303539c\n10.1021/acsnano.9b02483\n10.1002/adma.202006093\n10.1002/adma.201706846\n10.3390/nano7060143\n10.1002/adfm.202002868"}
{"title": "Paired personal interaction reveals objective differences between pushing and holding isometric muscle action.", "abstract": "In sports and movement sciences isometric muscle function is usually measured by pushing against a stable resistance. However, subjectively one can hold or push isometrically. Several investigations suggest a distinction of those forms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these two forms of isometric muscle action can be distinguished by objective parameters in an interpersonal setting. 20 subjects were grouped in 10 same sex pairs, in which one partner should perform the pushing isometric muscle action (PIMA) and the other partner executed the holding isometric muscle action (HIMA). The partners had contact at the distal forearms via an interface, which included a strain gauge and an acceleration sensor. The mechanical oscillations of the triceps brachii (MMGtri) muscle, its tendon (MTGtri) and the abdominal muscle (MMGobl) were recorded by a piezoelectric-sensor-based measurement system. Each partner performed three 15s (80% MVIC) and two fatiguing trials (90% MVIC) during PIMA and HIMA, respectively. Parameters to compare PIMA and HIMA were the mean frequency, the normalized mean amplitude, the amplitude variation, the power in the frequency range of 8 to 15 Hz, a special power-frequency ratio and the number of task failures during HIMA or PIMA (partner who quit the task). A \"HIMA failure\" occurred in 85% of trials (p < 0.001). No significant differences between PIMA and HIMA were found for the mean frequency and normalized amplitude. The MMGobl showed significantly higher values of amplitude variation (15s: p = 0.013; fatiguing: p = 0.007) and of power-frequency-ratio (15s: p = 0.040; fatiguing: p = 0.002) during HIMA and a higher power in the range of 8 to 15 Hz during PIMA (15s: p = 0.001; fatiguing: p = 0.011). MMGtri and MTGtri showed no significant differences.

Flow cytometry was successfully demonstrated using this system with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.16% with standard calibration beads. The sensitivities calibrated by rainbow beads are 518 MEFL in fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) channel and 264 MEPE in P-phycoerythrin (PE) channels, respectively. The linearities are more than 99% in both channels. The capability of the proposed microflow cytometer is further demonstrated by immunologically labeled leukocytes differentiation in blood. This acoustic-based microflow cytometer did not require any sheath flows or complex structures and can be mass produced.

A wireless transmission of electrical impulses from the capacitor is proposed, where the collected electrical energy is charged and discharged when a defined potential is reached.

We studied performance of the piezoelectric system to quantify the sleep-wake pattern in the rat over 7\u00a0days of recording compared with a visual electroencephalogram/electromyogram scoring, and under two light/dark (LD12:12 and LD16:8) photoperiods leading to change in the 24-hr sleep characteristics (N\u00a0=\u00a07 per group). The total sleep time (%/24\u00a0hr) over the 7\u00a0days recording and hourly sleep time over the last 24-hr recording were not statistically different between methods under the two photoperiods. Both methods detected higher total sleep time with the LD16:8 photoperiod compared with LD12:12 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), and correlated significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) at light and dark periods during each photoperiod. The accuracies for discrimination of sleep-wake patterns between methods were 81.9% and 84.9% for LD12:12 and LD16:8, respectively. In addition, spectral analysis of the respiratory signal given by piezo during all 10-s periods of the corresponding non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep periods recorded by electroencephalogram/electromyogram resulted in selection of 36 features that could be inserted in an automated non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep classification, with 90% accuracy with the electroencephalogram/electromyogram visual scoring. The piezo system proved to be a reliable non-invasive alternative to electroencephalogram recording to study total sleep time in rat, with feasibility to discriminate between non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep stages.

{"title": "An extended view for acoustofluidic particle manipulation: Scenarios for actuation modes and device resonance phenomenon for bulk-acoustic-wave devices.", "abstract": "For the manipulation of microparticles, ultrasonic devices, which employ acoustophoretic forces, have become an essential tool. There exists a widely used analytical expression in the literature which does not account for the effect of the geometry and acoustic properties of the chip material to calculate the acoustophoretic force and resonance frequencies. In this study, we propose an analytical relationship that includes the effect of the chip material on the resonance frequencies of an acoustophoretic chip. Similar to the analytical equation in the literature, this approach also assumes plane wave propagation. The relationship is simplified to a form which introduces a correction term to the acoustophoretic force equation for the presence of the chip material. The proposed equations reveal that the effect of the chip material on the resonance frequency is significant-and is called the device resonance-for acoustically soft materials. The relationship between the actuation modes of the piezoelectric actuator(s) and position of the nodal lines inside the channel are discussed. Finite element simulations are performed to verify the proposed equations.

Conventional bone splitting techniques require flap arising. This technical note demonstrates a method for flapless guided bone splitting. For this purpose, a newly developed surgical guide with internal irrigation channels was used. Using CAD-CAM additive technology, a narrow slot along the field of interest and a pin of a cooling pipe was designed and implemented in a surgical guide template. The bone split was performed flapless through the surgical guide while the cooling pipe was connected to it. During surgery, the piezo-driven instrument was moved within that slot, and the irrigation solution was directly rinsing it at point of entry through the irrigation channel. This procedure was performed on a 3.3 mm wide alveolar ridge achieving over 3 mm of bone gain. The described method combines several positive aspects. The micro-invasive flapless surgical procedure might improve postoperative healing.

Data regarding subjective (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence [ICIQ-UI] and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Overactive Bladder [ICIQ-OAB]) and objective (stress test and bladder diary) outcomes and complication rates were evaluated. Primary outcomes were objective (negative pad and stress test) and subjective (no leakage episodes) success after a median follow-up of 24 months.\nPVDF slings demonstrated a high level of satisfaction with objective cure (transobturator 90% compared with retropubic 100%, P = .90), urgency to urinate, frequency of de novo incontinence (transobturator 90% compared with retropubic 80%, P = .85), ability of physical and sexual activity (transobturator 90% compared with retropubic 100%, P = .90). The multivariate logistic regression model for satisfaction was associated with overall treatment success (odds ratio [OR] = 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.32-6.1), greater reduction in ICIQ-UI (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-1.85) and ICIQ-OAB (OR =0.99; 95% CI 0.89-1.78).

However, their continuous operation is often limited by conventional bulky and rigid batteries with a limited lifespan, which must be surgically removed after completing their missions and/or replaced after being exhausted. Herein, this paper gives a comprehensive review of recent advances in nonconventional energy solutions for implantable bioelectronics, emphasizing the miniaturized, flexible, biocompatible, and biodegradable power devices. According to their source of energy, the promising alternative energy solutions are sorted into three main categories, including energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors), internal energy-harvesting devices (including biofuel cells, piezoelectric/triboelectric energy harvesters, thermoelectric and biopotential power generators), and external wireless power transmission technologies (including inductive coupling/radiofrequency, ultrasound-induced, and photovoltaic devices). Their fundamentals, materials strategies, structural design, output performances, animal experiments, and typical biomedical applications are also discussed. It is expected to offer complementary power sources to extend the battery lifetime of bioelectronics while acting as an independent power supply. Thereafter, the existing challenges and perspectives associated with these powering devices are also outlined, with a focus on implantable bioelectronics.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["HongweiSheng", "XuetaoZhang", "JieLiang", "MingjiaoShao", "ErqingXie", "CunjiangYu", "WeiLan"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202100199"}

{"title": "Modeling and Experimental Characterization of Bonding Delaminations in Single-Element Ultrasonic Transducer.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic transducers performance can be seriously deteriorated by loss of adhesion between some constitutive elements such as the active element, the backing, or the matching layer. In the present work, the influence of bonding delaminations on the performance of a single-element ultrasonic transducer, which is composed of a piezoelectric disk, a backing, and a matching layer, is studied numerically and experimentally. Based on the positions between layers, two cases, i.e., delaminations between ceramic and backing or between ceramic and matching layer, are considered. Each case involves three different types of delaminations, which are marked as delamination type (DT)-I, II, and III. DT-I, a circular shape delamination, starts from the center and expands towards the peripheric zone; DT-II, an annular shape delamination, starts from the peripheric zone and expands towards the center; DT-III is a sector shape delamination with a given angle. The numerical simulations are performed by the finite element method and the influence of delaminations on the electromechanical admittance (EMA) of the transducer is investigated. 3D printed backings and matching layers are mounted on a PZT sample to assemble delaminated single-element transducers. An impedance analyzer is used for experimental measurements.

The core/shell-TrFE/CTFE membrane discloses a more prominent mechanical anisotropy between the revolving direction (RD) and cross direction (CD) associated with a higher tensile modulus of 26.9 MPa and good strength-ductility balance, beneficial from a better degree of nanofiber alignment, the increased density, and C-F bonding. The interfacial coupling between the terpolymer P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) and copolymer P(VDF-TrFE) is responsible for comparable full-frequency dielectric responses between the core/shell-TrFE/CTFE and pristine terpolymer. Moreover, an impressive piezoelectric coefficient up to 50.5 pm/V is achieved in the core/shell-TrFE/CTFE composite structure.

{"title": "Control of Spring Softening and Hardening in the Squared Daisy.", "abstract": "Nonlinear, mechanical microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonating structures exhibit large displacement and a relatively broad operating bandwidth. These unique features make them particularly of interest for the development of MEMS actuators and sensors. In this work, a mechanical MEMS structure allowing the designer to determine the type of nonlinearity, that is, softening or hardening, based on its anchor scheme is presented. Effects of the excitation signal on the behavior of the proposed MEMS in the frequency domain are investigated. In this regard, a comprehensive experimental comparison among the nonlinear behaviors of softening and hardening has been conducted. To reduce the hysteresis effect to a minimum, an excitation approach, which is a pulsed sweep in frequency with a discrete resolution, is presented. The maximal velocity, quality factor, bandwidth, and resonant frequency of these two types of nonlinear MEMS resonators are compared under three different types of excitation. Finally, it is shown that the performance and characteristics extracted from nonlinear mechanical MEMS resonating structures are highly dependent on the excitation method. Hence, in the present case, the apparent performances of the MEMS resonator can increase by up to 150% or decrease by up to 21%, depending on the excitation approaches.

An important aspect of the article is the description of the different ultrasonic sensor technologies that are currently present in the literature and what advantages and disadvantages they could bring in relation to the various phenomena investigated. In this context, the analysis of the front-end electronics is deepened, the type of data transmission both in terms of wired and wireless technology and of online and offline signal processing. The integration aspects of sensors for the creation of networks with autonomous nodes with the possibility of powering through energy harvesting devices and the embedded processing capacity is also studied.

{"title": "Optical Voltage Transformer Based on FBG-PZT for Power Quality Measurement.", "abstract": "Optical Current Transformers (OCTs) and Optical Voltage Transformers (OVTs) are an alternative to the conventional transformers for protection and metering purposes with a much smaller footprint and weight. Their advantages were widely discussed in scientific and technical literature and commercial applications based on the well-known Faraday and Pockels effect. However, the literature is still scarce in studies evaluating the use of optical transformers for power quality purposes, an important issue of power system designed to analyze the various phenomena that cause power quality disturbances. In this paper, we constructed a temperature-independent prototype of an optical voltage transformer based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and piezoelectric ceramics (PZT), adequate to be used in field surveys at 13.8 kV distribution lines. The OVT was tested under several disturbances defined in IEEE standards that can occur in the electrical power system, especially short-duration voltage variations such as SAG, SWELL, and INTERRUPTION. The results demonstrated that the proposed OVT presents a dynamic response capable of satisfactorily measuring such disturbances and that it can be used as a power quality monitor for a 13.8 kV distribution system. Test on the proposed system concluded that it was capable to reproduce up to the 41st harmonic without significative distortion and impulsive surges up to 2.5 kHz. As an advantage, when compared with conventional systems to monitor power quality, the prototype can be remote-monitored, and therefore, be installed at strategic locations on distribution lines to be monitored kilometers away, without the need to be electrically powered.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["Marceli NGon\u00e7alves", "Marcelo MWerneck"], "doi": "10.3390/s21082699\n10.1109/TDCLA.2006.311482\n10.1117/12.2304641\n10.1109/IMTC.2011.5944243\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.106891\n10.1109/ICSENS.2017.8234104\n10.1109/UPEC.2013.6714988\n10.1063/1.4986046\n10.1364/AO.58.008322\n10.3390/s20174830\n10.1109/ICSensT.2011.6136994\n10.1109/50.618320"}
{"title": "Metal Oxide Based Heterojunctions for Gas Sensors: A Review.", "abstract": "The construction of heterojunctions has been widely applied to improve the gas sensing performance of composites composed of nanostructured metal oxides. This review summarises the recent progress on assembly methods and gas sensing behaviours of sensors based on nanostructured metal oxide heterojunctions. Various methods, including the hydrothermal method, electrospinning and chemical vapour deposition, have been successfully employed to establish metal oxide heterojunctions in the sensing materials. The sensors composed with the built nanostructured heterojunctions were found to show enhanced gas sensing performance with higher sensor responses and shorter response times to the targeted reducing or oxidising gases compare with those of the pure metal oxides. Moreover, the enhanced gas sensing mechanisms of the metal oxide-based heterojunctions to the reducing or oxidising gases are also discussed, with the main emphasis on the important role of the potential barrier on the accumulation layer.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["ShulinYang", "GuiLei", "HuoxiXu", "ZhigaoLan", "ZhaoWang", "HaoshuangGu"], "doi": "10.3390/nano11041026\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.08.003\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.145\n10.1039/C6CP07799D\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.11.003\n10.1021/ac60191a001\n10.1155/2015/972025\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.10.070\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.06.031\n10.1166/jnn.2020.17175\n10.3390/s100302088\n10.1080/10739149.2017.1340896\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.12.004\n10.1021/acsami.5b01858\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.033\n10.1063/1.3046726\n10.1088/0957-4484/19/9/095508\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.02.046\n10.1016/j.snb.2004.05.015\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.06.039\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.07.074\n10.1166/jnn.2020.16903\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.05.111\n10.1039/C9NR02780G\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.12.089\n10.1039/C9RA00441F\n10.1088/2043-6262/7/1/015004\n10.1007/s10854-015-3484-3\n10.1155/2015/830127\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.06.063\n10.3390/s100404083\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.05.049\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.06.030\n10.1088/0957-4484/27/42/425503\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.127305\n10.1039/c3ta11867c\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.03.015\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2010.04.028\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.127828\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.01.148\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.06.103\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.11.028\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.027\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.07.146\n10.1039/c3nr03616b\n10.1038/srep35079\n10.1016/S0925-4005(03)00226-0\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.120\n10.3390/s21062103\n10.1016/j.snb.2005.08.010\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.09.028\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.12.077\n10.1021/acsami.6b00305\n10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128453\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.02.010\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.12.034\n10.1002/adfm.201002115\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.10.023\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.02.086\n10.1016/S0925-4005(01)00738-9\n10.1039/C5RA05661F\n10.1016/j.jcis.2016.05.061\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.198\n10.1016/j.matlet.2018.08.007\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.08.006\n10.1016/j.mseb.2017.10.012\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.03.058\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.04.029\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.11.120\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.10.108\n10.1039/c3tc30987h\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.04.094\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.05.111\n10.1021/ic300749a\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2517085\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab70d1\n10.1002/adem.201700589\n10.1016/j.jmrt.2019.05.016\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.03.029\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.03.019\n10.1016/j.jpcs.2018.05.005\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.12.019\n10.1016/j.mssp.2013.11.016\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.11.298\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.09.010\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.133\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.172\n10.1021/acsami.5b01817\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.08.085\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.06.120\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.11.165\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.184\n10.1039/C4TA06440B\n10.1155/2014/973156\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128191\n10.1039/C4TA00160E\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.01.246\n10.1021/acsomega.7b01515\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.03.098\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.05.167\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.05.104\n10.1021/acsami.7b01284\n10.1186/1556-276X-9-638\n10.1016/j.matlet.2020.127728\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.127347\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.07.143\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.04.053\n10.1088/1361-6528/aa6dd5\n10.1002/adfm.201202332\n10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.205\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.055\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.01.349\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.07.158\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.187\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.04.029\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.01.130\n10.1016/j.cplett.2005.11.040\n10.1063/1.2135391\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.05.054\n10.1007/s12540-017-6343-3\n10.1021/acsanm.9b00308\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.203\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.12.258\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.050\n10.1007/s12540-015-5376-8\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.11.130\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.04.097\n10.1016/j.mssp.2020.105196\n10.1021/am501063z\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128167\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128729\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.12.010\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.12.152\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.05.081\n10.1071/CH17354\n10.1038/srep07382\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128293\n10.1021/jp100685r\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.126970\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144270\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2020.110810\n10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.042\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.022\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128911\n10.1021/acsami.6b15669\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.07.073\n10.1016/j.mseb.2017.08.004\n10.1039/D1TC00391G\n10.1039/C6RA14342C\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.08.200\n10.1016/j.cap.2012.09.025\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.03.055\n10.1039/C5NR03796D\n10.1021/am400500a\n10.1039/C5CP07961F\n10.1002/pssa.201228664\n10.1088/1361-6528/28/4/045501\n10.1039/D0CP00567C\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.03.213\n10.1021/acsami.9b19971"}
{"title": "Detection of Sub-Nanomolar Concentration of Trypsin by Thickness-Shear Mode Acoustic Biosensor and Spectrophotometry.", "abstract": "The determination of protease activity is very important for disease diagnosis, drug development, and quality and safety assurance for dairy products. Therefore, the development of low-cost and sensitive methods for assessing protease activity is crucial. We report two approaches for monitoring protease activity: in a volume and at surface, via colorimetric and acoustic wave-based biosensors operated in the thickness-shear mode (TSM), respectively. The TSM sensor was based on a \u03b2-casein substrate immobilized on a piezoelectric quartz crystal transducer. After an enzymatic reaction with trypsin, it cleaved the surface-bound \u03b2-casein, which increased the resonant frequency of the crystal. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.48 \u00b1 0.08 nM. A label-free colorimetric assay for trypsin detection has also been performed using \u03b2-casein and 6-mercaptohexanol (MCH) functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs/MCH-\u03b2-casein). Due to the trypsin cleavage of \u03b2-casein, the gold nanoparticles lost shelter, and MCH increased the attractive force between the modified AuNPs. Consequently, AuNPs aggregated, and the red shift of the absorption spectra was observed. Spectrophotometric assay enabled an LOD of 0.42 \u00b1 0.03 nM.

Results showed that parallel bimorph sensor was found to be the best energy harvester, with measured capacitance being reasonably acceptable. Power output increased with the increase of sensor's surface area, loading frequency, and mechanical strain, but decreased with the increase of the sensor thickness. For all scenarios, sensors under flicking loading exhibited higher power output than that under bending.

{"title": "Design of a Wideband Tonpilz Transducer Comprising Non-Uniform Piezoceramic Stacks with Equivalent Circuits.", "abstract": "Tonpilz transducers are desirable for their superior performance in underwater target detection and communication applications. Several design schemes to widen their bandwidth have been reported, but these schemes often involve a complex structure or arrangement of additional components. In this study, a simple design is proposed to improve the bandwidth of a multimode Tonpilz transducer by using a non-uniform drive section that consists of piezoelectric stacks of various thicknesses. The efficacy of the design is illustrated with a multimode Tonpilz transducer having three lead zirconate titanate (PZT) stacks of different thicknesses. A new equivalent circuit was developed to analyze the frequency response of the transducer incorporating the non-uniform drive section and was used for rigorous analysis of the effects of varying the position and thickness of the non-uniform stacks on the transmitting characteristics of the transducer. The validity of the design was verified through the fabrication and characterization of a prototype multimode Tonpilz transducer. The developed structure can be readily extended to an arbitrary number of stacks in the Tonpilz transducer with any number of PZT disks in each stack.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["SeonghunPyo", "Muhammad ShakeelAfzal", "YoungsubLim", "SeungjinLee", "YongraeRoh"], "doi": "10.3390/s21082680\n10.1109/48.64891\n10.3390/s19214659\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112001\n10.1121/1.386794\n10.1109/58.535479\n10.1109/58.655631\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AEF.5.144\n10.1121/1.3377061\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.01.029\n10.1143/JJAP.49.07HG08\n10.1121/1.406879\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.10.016\n10.1121/1.4837217\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2132\n10.1109/58.212560\n10.1121/1.3654985\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.484\n10.1007/s00500-017-3002-z\n10.1121/1.392344\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.107066\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112507"}

{"title": "A Review of Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvesting with Magnetic Coupling Based on Different Structural Characteristics.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting technologies have attracted a lot of attention in recent decades, and the harvesters have been applied successfully in various fields, such as buildings, biomechanical and human motions. One important challenge is that the narrow frequency bandwidth of linear energy harvesting is inadequate to adapt the ambient vibrations, which are often random and broadband. Therefore, researchers have concentrated on developing efficient energy harvesters to realize broadband energy harvesting and improve energy-harvesting efficiency. Particularly, among these approaches, different types of energy harvesters adopting magnetic force have been designed with nonlinear characteristics for effective energy harvesting. This paper aims to review the main piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting technologies with magnetic coupling, and determine the potential benefits of magnetic force on energy-harvesting techniques. They are classified into five categories according to their different structural characteristics: monostable, bistable, multistable, magnetic plucking, and hybrid piezoelectric-electromagnetic energy harvesters. The operating principles and representative designs of each type are provided. Finally, a summary of practical applications is also shown. This review contributes to the widespread understanding of the role of magnetic force on piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting. It also provides a meaningful perspective on designing piezoelectric harvesters for improving energy-harvesting efficiency.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors":

Among the 2D composite membranes, PVDF with bismuth telluride at higher concentration (7%) exhibited the highest flux (about 3.9 L\u2219m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["MirkoFrappa", "FrancescaMacedonio", "AnnarosaGugliuzza", "WanqinJin", "EnricoDrioli"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes11050302\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.06.043\n10.1016/j.desal.2018.03.011\n10.1016/j.cep.2017.11.017\n10.5004/dwt.2010.1775\n10.1016/j.memsci.2004.09.051\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.027\n10.1039/C9EW01124B\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.12.038\n10.3390/membranes10070140\n10.1016/j.watres.2015.11.040\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.04.006\n10.1002/pen.24930\n10.3390/polym7081444\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.04.014\n10.1039/D0NA00403K\n10.3303/CET1973045\n10.1039/D0CP00928H\n10.1039/C9NR02581B\n10.1039/C8MH00612A\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118052\n10.3390/nano10061012\n10.1038/nature08916\n10.1103/RevModPhys.82.3045\n10.1038/nnano.2010.138\n10.1063/1.3293411\n10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-062910-140432\n10.1016/j.polymer.2018.09.043\n10.1002/adma.201506410\n10.1039/C8MH00487K\n10.1016/j.flatc.2019.100131\n10.1016/j.desal.2018.11.014\n10.1039/C0NR00323A\n10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116992\n10.1021/jp034461t"}
{"title": "On the Solubility and Stability of Polyvinylidene Fluoride.", "abstract": "This literature review covers the solubility and processability of fluoropolymer polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF). Fluoropolymers consist of a carbon backbone chain with multiple connected C-F bonds; they are typically nonreactive and nontoxic and have good thermal stability. Their processing, recycling and reuse are rapidly becoming more important to the circular economy as fluoropolymers find widespread application in diverse sectors including construction, automotive engineering and electronics. The partially fluorinated polymer PVDF is in strong demand in all of these areas; in addition to its desirable inertness, which is typical of most fluoropolymers, it also has a high dielectric constant and can be ferroelectric in some of its crystal phases. However, processing and reusing PVDF is a challenging task, and this is partly due to its limited solubility. This review begins with a discussion on the useful properties and applications of PVDF, followed by a discussion on the known solvents and diluents of PVDF and how it can be formed into membranes. Finally, we explore the limitations of PVDF's chemical and thermal stability, with a discussion on conditions under which it can degrade. Our aim is to provide a condensed overview that will be of use to both chemists and engineers who need to work with PVDF.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["Jean EMarshall",

The proposed modality generated shear waves by inducing oscillatory rotation on the lumen wall. Detection of the propagated waves was achieved at a set of receivers in mechanical contact with the lumen wall. The excitation element of the probe was an electromagnetic rotational actuator whilst the sensing element was comprised by a uniform anglewise arrangement of four piezoelectric receivers. The prototype was tested in two soft-tissue-mimicking phantoms that contained lumenlike conduits and stiffer inclusions. The shear wave speed of the different components of the phantoms was characterized using shear wave elastography. These values were used to estimate the time-of-flight of the expected reflections. Ultrafast ultrasound imaging, based on Loupas' algorithm, was used to estimate the displacement field in transversal planes to the lumenlike conduit and to compare against the readouts from the transluminal transmission-reception tests. Experimental observations between ultrafast imaging and the transluminal probe were in good agreement, and reflections due to the stiffer inclusions were detected by the transluminal probe. The obtained experimental evidence provided proof-of-concept for the transluminal elastography probe and encouraged further exploration of clinical applications.", "journal": "Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["AntonioGomez", "ManuelHurtado", "AntonioCallejas", "JorgeTorres", "NaderSaffari", "GuillermoRus"], "doi": "10.3390/diagnostics11040645\n10.7150/thno.18650\n10.3390/s20082379\n10.1088/1742-6596/684/1/012006\n10.14366/usg.18053\n10.1002/nbm.3956\n10.1186/s12880-020-0414-5\n10.1016/S0301-5629(99)00169-6\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2013.03.001\n10.1186/1476-7120-12-49\n10.1148/radiol.14140567\n10.11152/mu-1655\n10.11152/mu-2051\n10.1002/mrm.22633\n10.3390/s19153249\n10.3390/s17092078\n10.3390/s19153281\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2020.104261\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2014.09.016\n10.1097/RUQ.0b013e318249f594\n10.2214/AJR.17.18056\n10.3390/s17061402\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2013.02.006\n10.3348/kjr.2014.15.3.346\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2013.10.012\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1244748\n10.3390/diagnostics10020111\n10.1109/58.393110\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2007.10.009\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.03.006"}
{"title": "Design and Properties Analysis of Novel Modified 1-3 Piezoelectric Composite.", "abstract": "With the increasing demand for energy exchangers in underwater acoustic equipment, a modified 1-3 piezoelectric composite material is fabricated based on three-component phases. The new material outperforms the traditional two-phase 1-3 structure. Flexible silicone rubber polymer strengthened the piezoelectric composite and the properties of modified 1-3 piezoelectric composite have been tested by method of finite element simulation and experiment, respectively.

{"title": "Response of Transitional Mixtures Retaining Memory of In-Situ Overburden Pressure Monitored Using Electromagnetic and Piezo Crystal Sensors.", "abstract": "The major and minor components in granular soil materials determine their properties and behavior. This study explores the transitional behavior within threshold fines fraction of soil mixtures based on the data from the literature and experiments. From the literature survey, the void ratio, shear wave velocity, compression index, and friction angle capture the transitional turning point between the low and data-adjusted high threshold fines fractions. In particular, there is a dramatic change in hydraulic conductivity below the low threshold fines fraction that highlights the critical role of small amounts of fines in the fluid flow (e.g., clogging). From an experimental study, the engineering properties of natural soil samples identified using deformation and elastic wave sensors show transitional trends within the Revised Soil Classification System framework. The evolution of compressibility and shear wave velocity indicate that either coarse, fine, or both particles are likely to contribute to large and small strain stiffnesses when the effective stress is below 400 kPa. Thereafter, both engineering properties indicate that the soil sample retains a memory of in-situ overburden pressure when the effective stress is around 400 kPa. There is a critical role of fines that are slightly higher than low threshold fines fraction on engineering properties that promote the application of Revised Soil Classification System RSCS to natural soils.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["Sang YeobKim", "Jong-SubLee", "JungheePark"], "doi": "10.3390/s21072570\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2002)128:10(849)\n10.1046/j.1365-2389.1998.4940557.x\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2006)132:5(591)\n10.1520/D2487-17E01\n10.1139/t97-052\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2000)126:5(451)\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2009)135:9(1167)\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(1998)124:6(479)\n10.1021/ef101651b\n10.1007/s10035-015-0580-2\n10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2007)19:2(179)\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000027\n10.1016/j.powtec.2020.09.017\n10.1016/j.enggeo.2005.10.003\n10.1016/j.enggeo.2006.10.001\n10.1016/j.clay.2011.10.001\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2007)133:9(1136)\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001705\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001908\n10.1086/624388\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.61\n10.1520/STP37866S\n10.1144/GSL.JGS.1944.100.01-04.08\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001482\n10.1139/t01-029\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001391\n10.1007/s10035-011-0292-1\n10.2136/vzj2009.0138\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2005)131:9(1063)\n10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104302\n10.1038/s41598-020-78714-3\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0002426\n10.12989/sss.2011.7.4.275\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001157\n10.2118/88819-PA\n10.1139/T07-088"}
{"title": "Dimensional Roadmap for Maximizing the Piezoelectrical Response of ZnO Nanowire-Based Transducers: Impact of Growth Method.", "abstract": "ZnO nanowires are excellent candidates for energy harvesters, mechanical sensors, piezotronic and piezophototronic devices. The key parameters governing the general performance of the integrated devices include the dimensions of the ZnO nanowires used, their doping level, and surface trap density. However, although the method used to grow these nanowires has a strong impact on these parameters, its influence on the performance of the devices has been neither elucidated nor optimized yet. In this paper, we implement numerical simulations based on the finite element method combining the mechanical, piezoelectric, and semiconducting characteristic of the devices to reveal the influence of the growth method of ZnO nanowires. The electrical response of vertically integrated piezoelectric nanogenerators (VING) based on ZnO nanowire arrays operating in compression mode is investigated in detail. The properties of ZnO nanowires grown by the most widely used methods are taken into account on the basis of a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the experimental data found in the literature. Our results show that the performance of VING devices should be drastically affected by growth method. Important optimization guidelines are found.

{"title": "Vibroacoustical Performance Analysis of a Rigid Device Casing with Piezoelectric Shunt Damping.", "abstract": "Noise and vibration are common issues that may have a negative impact on human's' health. To minimize their consequences, several vibroacoustical methods may be employed. One well-known method is Piezoelectric Shunt Damping (PSD). Over the years, many approaches have been investigated, from passive, state switching circuits to active pulse-switching. In this paper, the authors propose three PSD implementations-passive Synchronized Switch Damping on Inductor (SSDI), semi-active SSDI and active Synchronized Switch Damping on Voltage source (SSDV)-for a single-panel structure mounted on a rigid-frame casing.

{"title": "Modelling of Power-Law Fluid Flow Inside a Piezoelectric Inkjet Printhead.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric three-dimensional inkjet printing has been used to manufacture heterogeneous objects due to its high level of flexibility. The materials used are non-Newtonian inks with complex rheological properties, and their behavior in the context of inkjet printing has not been fully understood: for example, the fact that the shear-thinning viscosity affects the droplet generation. Therefore, a control strategy coping with shear-thinning behaviors is needed to ensure printing consistency. In this paper, a novel model-based approach is presented to describe the shear-thinning ink dynamics inside the piezoelectric inkjet printhead, which provides the basis to design the excitation parameters in a systematic way. The dynamic equation is simplified into a quasi-one-dimensional equation through the combination of the boundary layer theory and the constitutive equation of the power-law fluid, of which the viscosity is shear-thinning. Based on this, a nonlinear time-varying equivalent circuit model is presented to simulate the power-law fluid flow rate inside the tube. The feasibility and effectiveness of this model can be evaluated by comparing the results of computational fluid dynamics and the experimental results.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["JuPeng", "JinHuang", "JianjunWang"], "doi": "10.3390/s21072441\n10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2773571\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2375203\n10.1108/RPJ-05-2016-0076\n10.1126/science.aaf2093\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2016.11.004\n10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.006\n10.1117/1.3486201\n10.1007/s00397-013-0688-4\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/11/115005\n10.1147/rd.203.0258\n10.1016/j.cep.2008.02.005\n10.1016/j.microrel.2010.11.017\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794064\n10.1016/j.jcp.2004.12.012\n10.1016/j.compfluid.2008.06.003\n10.1007/s10483-019-2514-7\n10.1109/TMECH.2007.901946\n10.1016/j.physrep.2010.03.003\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.11.001\n10.1007/s13202-013-0051-4\n10.1121/1.1603769\n10.1016/j.jnnfm.2011.04.011\n10.1147/rd.283.0314\n10.3390/s17061216\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2815924\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.02.009\n10.1080/10916466.2010.518191\n10.1080/01932691.2013.797908"}

Therefore, it is desirable to develop new strategies to obtain new formulations faster and with less reagent consumption. Here, we present a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic device that generates oil-in-water or water-in-oil mini-emulsions in continuous flow employing ultrasound as the driving force. A Langevin piezoelectric attached to the same glass slide as the microdevice provides enough power to create mini-emulsions in a single cycle and without reagents pre-homogenization. By introducing independently four different fluids into the microfluidic platform, it is possible to gradually modify the composition of oil, water and two different surfactants, to determine the most favorable formulation for minimizing droplet diameter and polydispersity, employing less than 500\u00a0\u00b5L of reagents. It was found that cavitation bubbles are the most important mechanism underlying emulsions formation in the microchannels and that degassing of the aqueous phase before its introduction to the device can be an important factor for reduction of droplet polydispersity.

{"title": "Inflation-collapse dynamics drive patterning and morphogenesis in intestinal organoids.", "abstract": "How stem cells self-organize to form structured tissues is an unsolved problem. Intestinal organoids offer a model of self-organization as they generate stem cell zones (SCZs) of typical size even without a spatially structured environment. Here we examine processes governing the size of SCZs. We improve the viability and homogeneity of intestinal organoid cultures to enable long-term time-lapse imaging of multiple organoids in parallel. We find that SCZs are shaped by fission events under strong control of ion channel-mediated inflation and mechanosensitive Piezo-family channels. Fission occurs through stereotyped modes of dynamic behavior that differ in their coordination of budding and differentiation. Imaging and single-cell transcriptomics show that inflation drives acute stem cell differentiation and induces a stretch-responsive cell state characterized by large transcriptional changes, including upregulation of Piezo1.

This study was therefore planned to explore the regulatory function of miR-567 in A549 NSCLC cells and investigate its possible molecular mechanism that may help in NSCLC treatment. In the current study, miR-567 expression was examined by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in different NSCLC cell lines in addition to normal cell line. A549 NSCLC cells were transfected by miR-567 mimic, miR-567 inhibitor, and negative control siRNA. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT and 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine assays. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were studied by flow cytometry. Bioinformatics analysis programs were used to expect the putative target of miR-567. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) gene at mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Our results found that miR-567 expressions decreased in all the studied NSCLC cells as compared to the normal cell line. A549 cell proliferation was suppressed by miR-567 upregulation while cell apoptosis was promoted. Also, miR-567 upregulation induced cell cycle arrest at sub-G1 and S phases. CDK8 was expected as a target gene of miR-567. MiR-567 upregulation decreased CDK8 mRNA and protein expression while the downregulation of miR-567 increased CDK8 gene expression. These findings revealed that miR-567 may be a tumor suppressor in A549 NSCLC cells through regulating CDK8 gene expression and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.", "journal": "Saudi journal of biological sciences", "date": "2021-04-30", "authors": ["Mohamed AElkady", "Ahmed SDoghish", "AhmedElshafei", "Mostafa MElshafey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.02.001"}

As the Osia has recently been CE certified and is new on the market, with limited patient outcome data for SSD available, the objective of this study was the evaluation of surgical procedure, audiological results, and patient satisfaction for the Osia in SSD patients.\nIn a prospective, monocentric clinical observation study, 6 patients (18 years of age or older) with SSD and bone conduction thresholds pure tone average 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz \u226425 dB HL on the contralateral side were implanted with an Osia. Analysis of clinical outcome data with respect to surgical technique, adverse events, audiological measurement, and subjective benefit for SSD patients was conducted. Audiological measurements performed included hearing thresholds, sound field thresholds, word recognition scores (WRS; in %) in quiet, and speech recognition thresholds in noise (in dB SNR). All tests were performed unaided and aided with the Osia. The subjective benefit with the Osia was determined by using 2 questionnaires; the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and the Bern Benefit in Single-Sided Deafness (BBSSD).\nPreliminary results indicate a straightforward surgical procedure with a low rate of complications and an improvement in speech perception in quiet, listening performance in everyday situations and patient satisfaction. However, in one of 6 subjects, a revision surgery had to be performed.\nProvided that SSD patients are open for CROS hearing, they can benefit from the Osia by reduced head shadow effects and better speech recognition. Special caution should be given to the skin at the site of implantation to avoid complications.", "journal": "Audiology & neuro-otology", "date": "2021-04-27", "authors": ["KerstinWillenborg", "EmilioAvallone", "HannesMaier", "ThomasLenarz", "SusanBusch"], "doi": "10.1159/000515489"}

In the piezo group, after flap reflection, bone cutting, granulation tissue removal, and root-end resection were performed using the piezoelectric surgical device and surgical carbide burs, and curettes were used in the control group. The quality of life of patients was evaluated daily for 1 week postsurgery for limitations of oral and general functions, pain, and other symptoms. Limitation of functions and other symptoms were recorded by a modified version of the patient's perception questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale for mouth opening, chewing, speaking, sleeping, daily routine, missed work, swelling, nausea, and bad taste/breath, and the visual analog scale was adopted for pain. Hemorrhage control during surgery was independently assessed by the surgeon and 2 blinded observers and recorded as 0 (no hemorrhage control), 1 (intermittent control), and 2 (complete control). The chi-square test was used to assess hemorrhage control. For variables related to function and symptoms other than pain and analgesics taken, the Fisher exact test was used. For the assessment of pain between the 2 groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used.\nFor parameters of quality of life, the piezo group showed significantly less swelling on the first, second, and third days and pain on the first and second days compared with the control group (P < .05). Analgesics taken were also significantly less in the piezo group (P < .05). In the piezo group, complete hemorrhage control was achieved in 10 patients, and in the control group, it was achieved only in 1 patient (P < .05).\nPiezoelectric surgery resulted in improved quality of life of patients in the first week postsurgery with lower levels of pain and swelling as well as the number of analgesics taken and better hemorrhage control during surgery.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2021-04-27", "authors": ["JayaBharathi", "ShwetaMittal", "SanjayTewari", "ShikhaTewari", "JigyasaDuhan", "PankajSangwan", "VinayKumar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2021.04.013"}
{"title": "Surface charge density measurement of a single protein molecule with a controlled orientation by AFM.", "abstract": "The spatial distribution of functional groups causes a charge distribution that often has a close relationship with its biofunctions. To understand them of the protein molecules, measurements of the charge distribution under physiological conditions are desired. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been utilized to measure the surface charge density by measuring the electric double layer (EDL) force caused by the overlap of the EDLs on the surfaces of the AFM tip and the biomolecule. Here, we demonstrated the surface charge density measurement of a single streptavidin (SA) protein molecule by the three-dimensional force mapping method based on frequency modulation AFM (FM-AFM). The SA has a strong affinity to biotin because of the electrostatic interactions between the molecules. Therefore, the surface charge density measurements of the biotin-binding sites and other surface areas of the molecule have been anticipated. However, the surface charge density of the surfaces other than the biotin-binding side has never been measured. We demonstrate the surface charge density measurement of the top surface of the single SA molecule, which is perpendicular to the biotin-binding sides, with a controlled orientation using DNA origami as a template by FM-AFM in an electrolyte solution. The surface charge density of the top surface of the SA molecule was estimated by fitting the experimental force curves to the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeck theory. We found that the surface charge density of the top surface of the SA molecule is comparable to those reported earlier for the biotin-binding sides of the molecule. We expect that, by using the DNA origami technology, one can control the orientation of a biomolecule attached to the substrate and measure the surface charge density of the specific surface areas of the biomolecule to obtain information that will help us to understand the relationship between their structures and functions.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2021-04-27", "authors": ["YukiYamamoto", "HiroakiKominami", "KeiKobayashi", "HirofumiYamada"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2021.04.016"}

{"title": "Metal-Free Multilayer Hybrid PENG Based on Soft Electrospun/-Sprayed Membranes with Cardanol Additive for Harvesting Energy from Surgical Face Masks.", "abstract": "Disposable surgical face masks are usually used by medical/nurse staff but the current Covid-19 pandemic has caused their massive use by many people. Being worn closely attached to the people's face, they are continuously subjected to routine movements, i.e., facial expressions, breathing, and talking. These motional forces represent an unusual source of wasted mechanical energy that can be rather harvested by electromechanical transducers and exploited to power mask-integrated sensors. Typically, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators are exploited to this aim; however, most of the current devices are too thick or wide, not really conformable, and affected by humidity, which make them hardly embeddable in a mask, in contact with skin. Different from recent attempts to fabricate smart energy-harvesting cloth masks, in this work, a wearable energy harvester is rather enclosed in the mask and can be reused and not disposed. The device is a metal-free hybrid piezoelectric nanogenerator (hPENG) based on soft biocompatible materials. In particular, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes in the pure form and with a biobased plasticizer (cardanol oil, CA) are electrospun onto a laser-ablated polyimide flexible substrate attached on a skin-conformable elastomeric blend of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and Ecoflex. The multilayer structure of the device harnesses the piezoelectricity of the PVDF nanofibers and the friction triboelectric effects. The ultrasensitive mechanoelectrical transduction properties of the composite device are determined by the strong electrostatic behavior of the membranes and the plasticization effect of cardanol. In addition, encapsulation based on PVDF, PDMS, CA, and parylene C is used, allowing the hPENG to exhibit optimal reliability and resistance against the wet and warm atmosphere around the face mask. The proposed device reveals potential applications for the future development of smart masks with coupled energy-harvesting devices, allowing to use them not only for anti-infective protection but also to supply sensors or active antibacterial/viral devices.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2021-04-27", "authors": ["MassimoMariello", "AntonioQualtieri", "GiuseppeMele", "MassimoDe Vittorio"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.1c01740"}
{"title": "Ultrasound-responsive nutlin-loaded nanoparticles for combined chemotherapy and piezoelectric treatment of glioblastoma cells.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), also known as grade IV astrocytoma, represents the most aggressive primary brain tumor. The complex genetic heterogeneity, the acquired drug resistance, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limit the efficacy of the current therapies, with effectiveness demonstrated only in a small subset of patients. To overcome these issues, here we propose an anticancer approach based on ultrasound-responsive drug-loaded organic piezoelectric nanoparticles. This anticancer nanoplatform consists of nutlin-3a-loaded ApoE-functionalized P(VDF-TrFE) nanoparticles, that can be remotely activated with ultrasound-based mechanical stimulations to induce drug release and to locally deliver anticancer electric cues. The combination of chemotherapy treatment with chronic piezoelectric stimulation resulted in activation of cell apoptosis and anti-proliferation pathways, induction of cell necrosis, inhibition of cancer migration, and reduction of cell invasiveness in drug-resistant GBM cells. Obtained results pave the way for the use of innovative multifunctional nanomaterials in less invasive and more focused anticancer treatments, able to reduce drug resistance in GBM. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Piezoelectric hybrid lipid-polymeric nanoparticles, efficiently encapsulating a non-genotoxic drug (nutlin-3a) and functionalized with a peptide (ApoE) that enhances their passage through the BBB, are proposed. Upon ultrasound stimulation, nanovectors resulted able to reduce cell migration, actin polymerization, and invasion ability of glioma cells, while fostering apoptotic and necrotic events.

Heat dissipation in LEDs is a fundamental issue that leads to a decrease in light output, a shortened lifespan, and the risk of catastrophic failure. Here, the temperature spatial distribution of the LEDs is revealed by using high-resolution infrared thermography, and the piezo-phototronic effect is proved to restrain efficaciously the temperature increment for the first time. We observe the temperature field and current density distribution of the LED array under external strain compensation. Specifically, the temperature rise caused by the self-heating effect is reduced by 47.62% under 0.1% external strain, which is attributed to the enhanced competitiveness of radiative recombination against nonradiative recombination due to the piezo-phototronic effect.

For further advancement in next-generation devices, a new class of buckled, hexagonal magnesium-based chalcogenide monolayers (MgX; X = S, Se, Te) have been predicted which are direct band gap semiconductors satisfying all the stability criteria. The MgTe monolayer shows a strong SOC with a Rashba constant of 0.63 eV \u00c5 that is tunable to the extent of \u00b10.2 eV \u00c5 via biaxial strain. Also, owing to its broken inversion symmetry and buckling geometry, MgTe has a very large in-plane as well as out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient. These results indicate its prospects for serving as a channel semiconducting material in self-powered piezo-spintronic devices. Furthermore, a prototype for a digital logic device can be envisioned using the ac pulsed technology via a perpendicular electric field. Heat transport is significantly suppressed in these monolayers as observed from their intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature: MgS (9.32 W m-1 K-1), MgSe (4.93 W m-1 K-1) and MgTe (2.02 W m-1 K-1). Further studies indicate that these monolayers can be used as photocatalytic materials for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen on account of having suitable band edge alignment and high charge carrier mobility.

The Surface Acoustic Wave induces a DC voltage in the ferromagnetic nanostrip. For measurements at constant current, this DC voltage makes the AMR loop asymmetric. In a series of different electrical experiments, we disentangle two different contributions to the induced DC voltage. One of them is independent on the external magnetic field and it is likely due to the acoustoelectric effect. A second contribution depends on the external magnetic field and it is a rectified voltage induced in the piezoelectric substrate as a response to the magnetization dynamics in the magnetostrictive nanostrip.

Discussions of lost data recovery using CS reported in literature are typically limited to acceleration signals obtained from vibration based SHM systems. Moreover these reports limit the study to performance analysis of recovery of signals in time domain, while feasibility of these algorithm on subsequent damage analysis using recovered signals remains unexplored. A systematic evaluation of performance of CS based signal recovery for algorithmic estimation of damage index (DI) in ultrasound SHM systems is important for determining their practicality for automated SHM applications. In this paper, we study the feasibility of DI estimation in ultrasonic guided wave testing of honeycomb composite sandwich structures (HCSS) using signals recovered from lossy sensor recordings. We emulate signal loss by masking the sensor recordings in an experimentally measured dataset comprising of an HCSS panel with two defects (disbond and high density (HD) core) instrumented with eight piezoelectric wafer and employ orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based signal recovery algorithm. Our analysis suggests that while OMP-based signal recovery algorithm is a robust and reliable signal recovery technique, producing signal reconstruction errors lesser than 8.4% for data loss as high as 50%, the magnitude error in DI estimation is significant and varies for different signal difference coefficient (SDC) algorithms.

{"title": "Ultrasonic Transducer From Piezoelectric Polymer Multilayer Through Electrophoretic Deposition for Photoacoustic Imaging.", "abstract": "Emerging ultrasound imaging modality based on optical-generated acoustic waves, such as photoacoustic (PA) imaging, has enabled novel functional imaging on biological samples. The performance of the ultrasonic transducer plays a critical role in producing higher quality PA images. However, the high electrical impedance of the small piezoelectric elements in the transducer array causes an electrical mismatch with external circuitry and results in degraded sensitivity. One effective method for reducing the electrical impedance is to implement a piezoelectric multilayer configuration instead of the conventional single layer for the transducer. In this work, we introduced an ultrasonic transducer comprising a piezoelectric polymer multilayer structure produced by an innovative multicycle powder-based electrophoretic deposition, using a suspension of polymer nanoparticles. The multicycle electrophoretic deposition overcomes the redissolution issue in solution-based methods. The ultrasonic transducer comprising the piezoelectric polymer multilayer exhibits significantly enhanced receiving sensitivity as compared to the ultrasonic transducer using a single layer. Ultrasonic transducer with multielement array configuration is obtained using the piezoelectric polymer multilayer, and PA imaging with improved resolution is demonstrated.

In an electromechanical device made of a ferromagnetic-piezoelectric heterostructure, we observe an anomalous negative electroresistance of \u223c-282% and a significant tuning of the metal-to-insulator transition temperature when an electric field is applied across the piezoelectric. Supported by finite-element simulations, we identify the electric field applied along the conducting bridge of the device as the plausible origin: stretching the underlying piezoelectric substrate gives rise to a lattice distortion of the ferromagnetic manganite overlayer through epitaxial strain. Large modulations of the resistance are also observed by applying static dc voltages across the thickness of the piezoelectric substrate. These results indicate that the emergent electronic phase separation in the manganites can be selectively manipulated when interfacing with a piezoelectric material, which offers great opportunities in designing oxide-based electromechanical devices.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2021-04-15", "authors": ["ZhenpingWu", "MargheritaBoselli", "DanfengLi", "AlexandreF\u00eate", "MartaGibert", "MichelViret", "StefanoGariglio"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.1c00085"}

{"title": "Nanomaterials Enabled and Bio/Chemical Analytical Sensors for Acrylamide Detection in Thermally Processed Foods: Advances and Outlook.", "abstract": "Acrylamide, a food processing contaminant with demonstrated genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity, is largely present in numerous prominent and commonly consumed food products that are produced by thermal processing methods. Food regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) and European Union Commission regulations have disseminated various acrylamide mitigation strategies in food processing practices. Hence, in the wake of such food and public health safety efforts, there is a rising demand for economic, rapid, and portable detection and quantification methods for these contaminants. Since conventional quantification techniques like liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods are expensive and have many drawbacks, sensing platforms with various transduction systems have become an efficient alternative tool for quantifying various target molecules in a wide variety of food samples. Therefore, this present review discusses in detail the state of robust, nanomaterials-based and other bio/chemical sensor fabrication techniques, the sensing mechanism, and the selective qualitative and quantitative measurement of acrylamide in various food materials. The discussed sensors use analytical measurements ranging from diverse and disparate optical, electrochemical, as well as piezoelectric methods.

Greenwood-Williamson (GM) theory was involved for the first time to describe the microscopic characteristics of the contact surfaces in which the contact surfaces were considered as random rough surfaces that were composed of large amounts of asperities and the heights of the asperities conformed to a Gauss distribution. The developed theoretical model gives an insight into the influence of the microscopic properties, as well as the macroscopic and material properties on the output performance of the actuator, which may provide guidance for the design of such type of piezoelectric actuator. During the modeling, normal kinetic contact force, kinetic friction coefficient, friction force and steady-state output force of were obtained in sequence. And some simulations were carried out to analyze how factors such as the type of material, the roughness of the contact surface, the initial distance between the stator and the rotor, and the preload, et.al, affect the contact performance. A set of experiments were carried out to reveal the influence of surface roughness, material type and preload on the steady-state output thrust. The simulated results were found in good agreement with the experiment ones at most of the tested points. Finally, surface roughness of the stator and rotor were tested before and after the operation, which indicated that the rotor and stator had similar roughness after operation.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-04-14", "authors": ["QiangZhang", "ShengchunPiao", "HongjuanChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106428"}

{"title": "Western Blotting of Membrane-Bound Proteins in Yarrowia lipolytica.", "abstract": "With the discovery of Western blotting as first described by Towbin et al. in 1979, the transfer and visualization of electrophoretically separated proteins on membranes has become the de facto method for the qualitative and quantitative detection of proteins of interest. In this method, proteins are resolved by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel, followed by a transfer of the separated proteins onto a nitrocellulose or polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Once immobilized on these membranes, the protein of interest can be detected and visualized by exploiting antigen-antibody interactions. However, not all proteins are amenable to easy detection by Western blotting. Integral membrane proteins are a class of proteins that are attached to a biological membrane through a series of transmembrane segments that span the width of the membrane. Due to the inherent hydrophobicity of these proteins and their tendency to aggregate, the characterization and detection of these proteins can be challenging. In this methods chapter, we present a protocol for the easy detection and quantification of these proteins in the industrially important oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. The first protocol describes a Western blotting procedure to quantify soluble cytosolic proteins of interest in Yarrowia lipolytica from its total cell lysate. The second protocol describes modifications to the first that are done to enhance detection and quantification of membrane-bound proteins in Yarrowia lipolytica from its total cell lysate, without the need for isolating the membrane-bound proteins, for use in Western blotting.

{"title": "Mechanotransduction channel Piezo is widely expressed in the spider, Cupiennius salei, mechanosensory neurons and central nervous system.", "abstract": "Mechanosensory neurons use mechanotransduction (MET) ion channels to detect mechanical forces and displacements. Proteins that function as MET channels have appeared multiple times during evolution and occur in at least four different families: the DEG/ENaC and TRP channels, as well as the TMC and Piezo proteins. We found twelve putative members of MET channel families in two spider transcriptomes, but detected only one, the Piezo protein, by in situ hybridization in their mechanosensory neurons. In contrast, probes for orthologs of TRP, ENaC or TMC genes that code MET channels in other species did not produce any signals in these cells. An antibody against C. salei Piezo detected the protein in all parts of their mechanosensory cells and in many neurons of the CNS.

Looking back in history, airborne transimission diseases have caused huge casualties several times. COVID-19 as a typical airborne disease caught our attention and reminded us of the importance of preventing such diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on finding a new way to guard against the spread of these diseases such as COVID-19. This paper studies the dynamic electromechanical response of metal-core piezoelectric fiber/epoxy matrix composites, designed as mass load sensors for virus detection, by numerical modelling. The dynamic electromechanical response is simulated by applying an alternating current (AC) electric field to make the composite vibrate. Furthermore, both concentrated and distributed loads are considered to assess the sensitivity of the biosensor during modelling of the combination of both biomarker and viruses. The design parameters of this sensor, such as the resonant frequency, the position and size of the biomarker, will be studied and optimized as the key values to determine the sensitivity of detection. The novelty of this work is to propose functional composites that can detect the viruses from changes of the output voltage instead of the resonant frequency change using piezoelectric sensor and piezoelectric actuator. The contribution of this detection method will significantly shorten the detection time as it avoids fast Fourier transform (FFT) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The outcome of this research offers a reliable numerical model to optimize the design of the proposed biosensor for virus detection, which will contribute to the production of high-performance piezoelectric biosensors in the future.", "journal": "Sensors and actuators.

In particular, the surface potential is mainly dominated by the inherent piezoelectricity of the biomaterial and the dynamic adhesion state of cells. The development of an efficient and optimized material interface would have important implications in cell regulation. Herein, we modified the surface of poled poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes through polymerization of dopamine and investigated their influence on cell adhesion and electromechanical self-stimulation. Our results demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells seeded on the poled PVDF membrane exhibited stronger cell spreading and adhesion. Meanwhile, the surface modification through polydopamine significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the samples and contributed to the formation of cell actin bundles and maturation of focal adhesions, which further positively modulated cell piezoelectric self-stimulation and induced intracellular calcium transients. Combining with theoretical simulations, we found that the self-stimulation was enhanced mainly due to the increase of the adhesion site and adhesion force magnitude.

{"title": "Adaptive Control Improves Sclera Force Safety in Robot-Assisted Eye Surgery: A Clinical Study.", "abstract": "The integration of robotics into retinal microsurgery leads to a reduction in surgeon perception of tool-to-tissue interaction forces. This blunting of human tactile sensory input, which is due to the inflexible mass and large inertia of the robotic arm as compared to the milli-Newton scale of the interaction forces and fragile tissues during ophthalmic surgery, identifies a potential iatrogenic risk during robotic eye surgery. In this paper, we aim to evaluate two variants of an adaptive force control scheme implemented on the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) that are intended to mitigate the risk of unsafe scleral forces. The present study enrolled ten retina fellows and ophthalmology residents into a simulated procedure, which simply asked the trainees to follow retinal vessels in a model retina surgery environment. For this purpose, we have developed a force-sensing (equipped with Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)) instrument to attach to the robot. A piezo-actuated linear stage for creating random lateral motions to the eyeball phantom has been provided to simulate disturbances during surgery. The SHER and all of its dependencies were set up in an operating room in the Wilmer Eye Institute at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The clinicians conducted robot-assisted experiments with the adaptive controls incorporated as well as freehand manipulations. The results indicate that the Adaptive Norm Control (ANC) method, is able to maintain scleral forces at predetermined safe levels better than even freehand manipulations. Novice clinicians in robot training however, subjectively preferred freehand maneuvers over robotic manipulations.

{"title": "An experimental system to evaluate impact shear failure of rock discontinuities.", "abstract": "Conventionally, the evaluation of shear failure of discontinuities in rocks and other geomaterials has been conducted under static shear loading. In such methods, the shear failure behaviors of rock discontinuities are significantly influenced by loading velocities. To evaluate the shear failure process under dynamic loading, in this paper, we propose a new experimental methodology by taking advantages of recently available high-speed optical and mechanical measurement techniques. The methodology utilizes the Hopkinson bar to apply impact loading, and the diagnostics include a dynamic stress wave acquisition system, a digital image correlation (DIC) system, and an acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system. To improve the accuracy of the DIC analysis, an advanced digital speckle pattern and an updated water transfer printing are used to obtain the optimized and consistent speckle pattern. A flexible piezoelectric film sensor is first introduced to acquire AE signals in order to locate AE events accurately. A dynamic impact shear experiment indicates that the normal stress has a significant effect on the peak shear stress of rock discontinuities and the peak shear stress itself is rate dependent. The displacement field along shear directions is quantified using the DIC method, and the initial AE source locations during the impact shear process are determined using the AE monitoring system. We thus conclude that the dynamic impact shear system can systematically characterize the dynamic impact shear process with quantitative details and can further be implemented to study other dynamic impact failure behaviors of rock discontinuities under in situ stresses.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2021-04-07", "authors": ["WeiYao", "ChonglangWang", "KaiwenXia", "XinZhang"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0032003"}

Piezoelectric-actuator stacks as nanopositioners with working strokes of 10\u00a0\u03bcm and positioning resolution \u223c(1-10) nm are desirable for both basic research and industrial applications. However, information on the performance of most commercial piezoelectric actuators in cryogenic environment and in the presence of magnetic fields in excess of 5\u00a0T is generally not available. In particular, the magnitude, the rate, and the associated hysteresis of the piezo-displacement at cryogenic temperatures are the most relevant parameters that determine whether a particular piezoelectric actuator can be used as a nanopositioner. Here, the design and realization of an experimental setup based on interferometric techniques to characterize a commercial piezoelectric actuator over a temperature range of 2\u00a0K \u2264 T \u2264 260\u00a0K and magnetic fields up to 6\u00a0T are presented.

However, the ruby scale can often hardly be used for programmably controlled DAC devices, especially the piezoelectric-driving cells, where a continuous pressure calibration is required. In this work, we present an effective pressure gauge for DACs made of Manganin metal based on the four-probe resistivity measurements. Pressure dependence of its resistivity is well established and shows excellent linear relations in the 0-30\u00a0GPa pressure range with a slope of 23.4 (9) GPa for the first-cycle compression, in contrast to that of multiple-cycle compression and decompression having a nearly identical slope of 33.7 (4) GPa likely due to the strain effect. In addition, the such-established Manganin scale can be used for continuously monitoring the cell pressure of piezoelectric-driving DACs, and the reliability of this method is also verified by the fixed-point method with a Bi pressure standard. Realization of continuous pressure calibration for programmably controlled DACs would offer many opportunities for the study of dynamics, kinetics, and critical behaviors of pressure-induced phase transitions.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2021-04-07", "authors": ["JianChen", "HuCheng", "XuefengZhou", "XiaozhiYan", "LingfeiWang", "YushengZhao", "ShanminWang"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0040847"}

{"title": "Development of Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane via Assembly of Tannic Acid and Polyvinylpyrrolidone for Filtration of Oil/Water Emulsion.", "abstract": "Wastewater containing oil/water emulsion has a serious ecological impact and threatens human health. The impact worsens as its volume increases. Oil/water emulsion needs to be treated before it is discharged or reused again for processing. A membrane-based process is considered attractive in effectively treating oil/water emulsion, but progress has been dampened by the membrane fouling issue. The objective of this study is to develop polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes customized for oil/water emulsion separation by incorporating assembly of tannic acid (TA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in the polymer matrix. The results show that the assembly of TA/PVP complexation was achieved as observed from the change in colour during the phase inversion and as also proven from the characterization analyses. Incorporation of the TA/PVP assembly leads to enhanced surface hydrophilicity by lowering the contact angle from 82\u00b0 to 47\u00b0. In situ assembly of the TA/PVP complex also leads to enhanced clean water permeability by a factor of four as a result of enhanced mean flow pore size from 0.2 to 0.9 \u00b5m. Owing to enhanced surface chemistry and structural advantages, the optimum hydrophilic PVDF/TA/PVP membrane poses permeability of 540.18 L/(m", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["Normi Izati MatNawi", "SyasyaOng Amat", "Muhammad RoilBilad", "Nik Abdul Hadi MdNordin", "NorazanitaShamsuddin", "SaifulPrayogi", "ThanitpornNarkkun", "KajornsakFaungnawakij"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13060976\n10.5772/intechopen.74769\n10.1016/j.jcis.2019.08.114\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.03.054\n10.1016/S0304-3894(97)00146-5\n10.1016/j.jece.2020.104269\n10.1016/j.asej.2020.08.027\n10.1016/j.jece.2020.104164\n10.1021/am401462e\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.04.057\n10.3390/polym13030427\n10.3390/membranes10060121\n10.1021/acsami.6b15682\n10.3390/polym12112519\n10.1016/j.supflu.2017.10.026\n10.1016/j.jcis.2018.12.038\n10.1016/j.jcis.2018.08.055\n10.1016/j.jcis.2019.03.099\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124011\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.160\n10.1002/ange.201304922\n10.3390/polym11121975\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.05.099\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.09.015\n10.1021/ie101928r\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.04.005\n10.1021/acs.macromol.6b02106\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.09.029\n10.1007/s10853-016-9744-7\n10.11113/mjfas.v14n3.1215\n10.1002/admi.201500298\n10.3390/polym6061846\n10.1039/C5RA23490E\n10.1021/cm1031392\n10.34133/2019/2581241\n10.1016/j.memsci.2003.12.012\n10.1016/j.memsci.2003.09.004\n10.1016/j.seppur.2005.02.010\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2020.101350\n10.3390/polym12020432\n10.1016/j.biteb.2020.100429\n10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.175\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124544"}

{"title": "A New Method to Perform Direct Efficiency Measurement and Power Flow Analysis in Vibration Energy Harvesters.", "abstract": "Measuring the efficiency of piezo energy harvesters (PEHs) according to the definition constitutes a challenging task. The power consumption is often established in a simplified manner, by ignoring the mechanical losses and focusing exclusively on the mechanical power of the PEH. Generally, the input power is calculated from the PEH's parameters. To improve the procedure, we have designed a method exploiting a measurement system that can directly establish the definition-based efficiency for different vibration amplitudes, frequencies, and resistance loads. Importantly, the parameters of the PEH need not be known. The input power is determined from the vibration source; therefore, the method is suitable for comparing different types of PEHs. The novel system exhibits a combined absolute uncertainty of less than 0.5% and allows quantifying the losses. The approach was tested with two commercially available PEHs, namely, a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) MIDE PPA-1011 and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) TE LDTM-028K. To facilitate comparison with the proposed efficiency, we calculated and measured the quantity also by using one of the standard options (simplified efficiency). The standard concept yields higher values, especially in PVDFs. The difference arises from the device's low stiffness, which produces high displacement that is proportional to the losses. Simultaneously, the insufficient stiffness markedly reduces the PEH's mechanical power. This effect cannot be detected via the standard techniques. We identified the main sources of loss in the damping of the movement by the surrounding air and thermal losses. The latter source is caused by internal and interlayer friction.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["JanKunz", "JiriFialka", "StanislavPikula", "PetrBenes", "JakubKrejci", "StanislavKlusacek", "ZdenekHavranek"], "doi": "10.3390/s21072388\n10.3390/s20247039\n10.3390/s19112572\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/7/007\n10.1016/j.eml.2017.05.002\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/5/009\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/5/055006\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/001\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/2/025007\n10.1088/1742-6596/476/1/012137\n10.1063/1.2344868\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.07.029\n10.1109/TIM.2013.2265452\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106277\n10.1115/1.4025996\n10.1177/1045389X08099468\n10.1007/s00542-016-2832-4\n10.1088/1742-6596/1065/20/202008\n10.1109/TIM.2020.3026462\n10.1109/MPRV.2005.14\n10.3390/s18051584\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115521"}
{"title": "Hydrophobic Polymeric Additives toward a Long-Term Robust Carbonaceous Mudstone Slope.", "abstract": "Slopes with carbonaceous mudstone (CM) are widely distributed in the southwest of China and have experienced numerous geological disasters in special climate, especially in rainfall conditions. Therefore, novel materials to stabilize CM slopes have attracted increasing interests. However, developing ultra-stable and cost-effective additives for CM slopes is still a great challenge. Herein, a hydrophobic polymeric material (polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF) is investigated as an additive to enhance the mechanical strength and long-time stability of CM slopes. The PVDF is uniformly dispersed in CM matrix via interfacial interaction. The contact angle of the PVDF-modified carbonaceous mudstone (PVDF-MCM) can reach as high as 103.95\u00b0, indicating an excellent hydrophobicity. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and tensile strength (TS) of PVDF-MCM have been intensively enhanced to 4.07 MPa and 1.96 MPa, respectively, compared with ~0 MPa of pristine CM. Moreover, the UCS and TS of PVDF-MCM remain at 3.24 MPa and 1.03 MPa even after curing for 28 days in high humidity conditions. Our findings show that the PVDF can improve the hydrophobicity of CM significantly, which leads to super mechanical stability of PVDF-MCM.

However, PMUT arrays have so far failed to combine the wide, high-frequency bandwidth needed to achieve a high axial resolution. In this paper, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) backing structure is introduced into the PMUTs to improve the device bandwidth while keeping a sub-wavelength (\u03bb) pitch. We implement this backing on a 16 \u00d7 8 array with 75 \u00b5m pitch (3\u03bb/4) with a 15 MHz working frequency. Adding the backing nearly doubles the bandwidth to 92% (-6 dB) and has little influence on the impulse response sensitivity.

{"title": "Analytical Modeling and Validation of a Preloaded Piezoceramic Current Output.", "abstract": "Energy harvesting using piezoceramic has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Its potential usage in microelectromechanical systems is starting to become a reality thanks to the development of an integrated circuit. An accurate equivalent circuit of piezoceramic is important in energy harvesting and the sensing system. A piezoceramic is always considered to be a current source according to empirical testing, instead of the derivation from its piezoelectric characteristics, which lacks accuracy under complicated mechanical excitation situations. In this study, a new current output model is developed to accurately estimate its value under various kinds of stimulation. Considering the frequency, amplitude and preload variation imposed on a piezoceramic, the multivariate model parameters are obtained in relation to piezo coefficients. Using this model, the current output could be easily calculated without experimental testing in order to quickly estimate the output power in energy harvesting whatever its geometric shape and the various excitations.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["BinZhang", "HongshengLiu", "DezhiLi", "JinhuiLiang", "JunGao"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12040353\n10.1109/MPRV.2005.14\n10.1002/ett.1466\n10.1143/JJAP.35.3267\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/11/026\n10.1016/j.eml.2017.05.002\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2004.00120.x\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2018.11.102\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.065\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2762640\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaf0ea\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.12.009\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2777402\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.005\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.04.040\n10.1016/j.jsv.2019.115142\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.082\n10.1177/1045389X17730917\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/6/065026\n10.1177/1045389X18810802\n10.1109/JSSC.2018.2868299\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab6484\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.09.033\n10.1155/2018/8475896\n10.1140/epjb/e2016-60699-0\n10.1177/1045389X17704914\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.06.026\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.10.043\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1428041\n10.1177/1045389X05056859"}
{"title": "Crystallinity and \u03b2 Phase Fraction of PVDF in Biaxially Stretched PVDF/PMMA Films.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blend films were prepared using biaxial stretching. The effects of PMMA content and stretching ratio on the crystallinity and \u03b2 phase fraction of PVDF in blend films were investigated. The distributions of crystallinity and \u03b2 phase fraction on variable locations were also studied. The results of FTIR and XRD showed that \u03b2 phase appeared in PVDF/PMMA blends after extrusion and casting procedures. Although \u03b2 phase fraction decreased after preheating, there was still an increasing trend during following biaxial stretching. More importantly, the increase in PMMA content improved \u03b2 phase fraction, and the highest \u03b2 phase fraction of 93% was achieved at PMMA content of 30 wt% and stretching ratio of 2\u00d72. Besides, the reduction in PMMA content and the increase in stretching ratio improved the crystallinity of PVDF. The mechanical properties of the stretched films were significantly improved by increasing the stretching ratio as well. The uniform stress distribution on different regions of biaxial stretching films contributed to the uniform distribution of \u03b2 phase fraction and crystallinity of PVDF with the aid of simulation. This work confirmed that biaxial stretching can be a candidate method to prepare PVDF/PMMA blend films with uniform distributions of comparable \u03b2 phase and crystallinity of PVDF.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["YeZhou", "WentingLiu", "BinTan", "ChengZhu", "YaruNi", "LiangFang", "ChunhuaLu", "ZhongziXu"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13070998\n10.1002/adma.201200150\n10.1002/adma.201602251\n10.1021/nl202208n\n10.1021/nl9040719\n10.1016/S0142-9418(03)00003-5\n10.1002/1097-0126(200101)50:1<10::AID-PI614>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2004.12.040\n10.1039/c2ce06654h\n10.1002/polb.23146\n10.3390/polym9090448\n10.1080/00222340701388680\n10.1002/pen.20935\n10.1038/pj.2012.76\n10.1007/s11706-011-0152-2\n10.1021/ma301460h\n10.1002/app.37718\n10.1021/acs.iecr.8b05545\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.010\n10.1021/jp3038768\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2014.10.003\n10.1021/jp3043494\n10.1007/s10853-011-5916-7\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.05.034\n10.1007/s12034-017-1390-4\n10.1002/adfm.201700702\n10.1016/j.polymer.2012.01.058\n10.1007/s10853-015-8986-0\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2020.105857\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/8/085020\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/8/087002\n10.1063/1.326429\n10.1038/s41467-019-12391-3\n10.1016/j.tca.2007.05.023\n10.1002/app.46677\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2013.05.010\n10.1016/j.polymer.2012.04.008\n10.1039/C3RA45134H\n10.1002/app.46324\n10.1021/acsami.6b01287\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2006.08.003\n10.1002/pat.4426\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.04.001\n10.5254/1.3538343\n10.3844/ajeassp.2010.232.239\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2019.106312\n10.1080/03602559.2012.735314\n10.1080/00222340902837527\n10.1002/app.25635"}
{"title": "Case Study of Polyvinylidene Fluoride Doping by Carbon Nanotubes.", "abstract": "Modern material science often makes use of polyvinylidene fluoride thin films because of various properties, like a high thermal and chemical stability, or a ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric activity.

By introducing carbon nanotubes via electrospinning, it is possible to affect the chemical and electrical properties of the resulting composite. In the case of this paper, the focus was on the further improvement of interesting polyvinylidene fluoride properties by incorporating carbon nanotubes, such as changing the concentration of crystalline phases and the resulting increase of the dielectric constant and conductivity. These changes in properties have been explored by several methods that focused on a structural, chemical and electrical point of view.

{"title": "Modeling of a Rope-Driven Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester for Low-Frequency and Wideband Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "In this work, a mechanical model of a rope-driven piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (PVEH) for low-frequency and wideband energy harvesting was presented. The rope-driven PVEH consisting of one low-frequency driving beam (LFDB) and one high-frequency generating beam (HFGB) connected with a rope was modeled as two mass-spring-damper suspension systems and a massless spring, which can be used to predict the dynamic motion of the LFDB and HFGB. Using this model, the effects of multiple parameters including excitation acceleration, rope margin and rope stiffness in the performance of the PVEH have been investigated systematically by numerical simulation and experiments. The results show a reasonable agreement between the simulation and experimental study, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed model of rope-driven PVEH. It was also found that the performance of the PVEH can be adjusted conveniently by only changing rope margin or stiffness. The dynamic mechanical model of the rope-driven PVEH built in this paper can be used to the further device design or optimization.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["JinhuiZhang", "MaoyuLin", "WeiZhou", "TaoLuo", "LifengQin"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12030305\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/031\n10.1002/adfm.201902522\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c01225\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.09.013\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.03.024\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.05.009\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.053\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/105013\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/10/104014\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.020\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.01.033\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.060\n10.3390/mi11080713\n10.1002/adma.202006839\n10.1002/admt.201800588\n10.1039/C4FD00159A\n10.1038/s41528-017-0007-8\n10.1016/j.enconman.2010.07.024\n10.1016/j.nantod.2021.101108\n10.1002/adfm.202004446\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.11.035\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.12.032\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/5/055017\n10.1016/j.proche.2009.07.297\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/10/104001\n10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2067431\n10.1016/j.mejo.2006.07.023\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.03.003\n10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00248-7\n10.1063/1.4900845\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/030\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/9/094006\n10.1016/j.rser.2020.110473\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2018.02.003\n10.1115/1.4026278\n10.1109/TUFFC.903\n10.1016/j.mejo.2007.12.017\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.02.003\n10.1063/1.4927466\n10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.02.017\n10.1177/1045389X10390249\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.12.033\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.03.017\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035005\n10.1063/1.4816249\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/4/045004\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.143\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2015.03.001\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065020\n10.1109/TMECH.2013.2296776\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/12/125011\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.917125\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.04.027\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.077\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.02.001\n10.3390/app6120402\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.261\n10.1063/5.0022881\n10.1177/1045389X08097385"}

{"title": "Design and Performance Evaluation of a \"Fixed-Point\" Spar Buoy Equipped with a Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Unit for Floating Near-Shore Applications.", "abstract": "In the present work, a spar-buoy scaled model was designed and built through a \"Lab-on-Sea\" unit, equipped with an energy harvesting system. Such a system is based on deformable bands, which are loyal to the unit, to convert wave motion energy into electricity by means of piezo patch transducers. In a preliminary stage, the scaled model, suitable for tests in a controlled ripples-type wave motion channel, was tested in order to verify the \"fixed-point\" assumption in pitch and roll motions and, consequently, to optimize energy harvesting.

{"title": "Fabrication and Analysis of Near-Field Electrospun PVDF Fibers with Sol-Gel Coating for Lithium-Ion Battery Separator.", "abstract": "Environmental and economic concerns are driving the demand for electric vehicles. However, their development for mass transportation hinges largely on improvements in the separators in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the preferred energy source. In this study, innovative separators for LIBs were fabricated by near-field electrospinning (NFES) and the sol-gel method. Using NFES, poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) fibers were fabricated. Then, PVDF membranes with pores of 220 nm and 450 nm were sandwiched between a monolayer and bilayer of the electrospun fibers. Nanoceramic material with organic resin, formed by the sol-gel method, was coated onto A4 paper, rice paper, nonwoven fabric, and carbon synthetic fabric. Properties of these separators were compared with those of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), microtensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ion-conductivity measurement, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and charge-discharge cycling. The results indicate that the 220 nm PVDF membrane sandwiched between a bilayer of electrospun fibers had excellent ionic conductivity (~0.57 mS/cm), a porosity of ~70%, an endothermic peak of ~175 \u00b0C, better specific capacitance (~356 mAh/g), a higher melting temperature (~160 \u00b0C), and a stable cycle performance. The sol-gel coated nonwoven fabric had ionic conductivity, porosity, and specific capacitance of ~0.96 mS/cm., ~64%, and ~220 mAh/g, respectively, and excellent thermal stability despite having a lower specific capacitance (65% of PP separator) and no peak below 270 \u00b0C.

{"title": "Duhem Model-Based Hysteresis Identification in Piezo-Actuated Nano-Stage Using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization.", "abstract": "This paper presents modeling and parameter identification of the Duhem model to describe the hysteresis in the Piezoelectric actuated nano-stage. First, the parameter identification problem of the Duhem model is modeled into an optimization problem. A modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) technique, which escapes the problem of local optima in a traditional PSO algorithm, is proposed to identify the parameters of the Duhem model. In particular, a randomness operator is introduced in the optimization process which acts separately on each dimension of the search space, thus improving convergence and model identification properties of PSO. The effectiveness of the proposed MPSO method was demonstrated using different benchmark functions. The proposed MPSO-based identification scheme was used to identify the Duhem model parameters; then, the results were validated using experimental data. The results show that the proposed MPSO method is more effective in optimizing the complex benchmark functions as well as the real-world model identification problems compared to conventional PSO and genetic algorithm (GA).", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["KhubabAhmed", "PengYan", "SuLi"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12030315\n10.3390/s20061621\n10.1063/1.3551725\n10.3390/s20010315\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106634\n10.1007/s11831-009-9031-8\n10.1016/j.camwa.2011.12.015\n10.1115/1.4028055\n10.1109/TASE.2014.2352364\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.04.012\n10.3390/mi10100680\n10.1109/TAC.2007.892369\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.058\n10.1155/2013/814919\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2014.06.002\n10.1109/TMAG.2007.892513\n10.1142/S0217984918501312\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.09.043\n10.3390/mi7090168\n10.3390/mi11080715\n10.1016/j.ins.2020.01.018\n10.1155/2020/8543131\n10.1177/1687814017702813\n10.1016/j.isatra.2017.07.004\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.10.029\n10.1109/TMAG.2015.2487678\n10.1155/2014/932974\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2010.06.009\n10.1177/1045389X19831360\n10.3390/mi10120861\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.12.003\n10.1016/j.swevo.2018.01.011\n10.1063/1.4991854\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.083\n10.1016/j.mattod.2020.01.018\n10.1016/j.advengsoft.2017.07.002"}
{"title": "A New Acoustic-Based Approach for Assessing Induced Adulteration in Bovine Milk.", "abstract": "Milk is an important dietary requirement for many populations due to its high nutritional value. However, increased demand has also made it prone to fraudulent activity. In this sense, scientists have sought to develop simple, low-cost, and portable techniques to achieve quality control of milk in industry and farms as well. This work proposes a new instrumentation system based on acoustic propagation and advanced signal processing techniques to identify milk adulteration by industrial contaminants. A pair of transmitter-receiver low-cost piezoelectric transducers, configured in a pitch-catch mode, propagated acoustic waves in the bovine milk samples contaminated with 0.5% of sodium bicarbonate, urea, and hydrogen peroxide. Signal processing approaches such as chromatic technique and statistical indexes like the correlation coefficient, Euclidian norm and cross-correlation square difference were applied to identify the contaminants. According to the presented results, CCSD and RMSD metrics presented more effectiveness to perform the identification of milk contaminants.

Using piezoelectric pedometers, step count data were collected during physical education, recess, lunch, and during academic class time. A multi-level mixed effects model associated the step count composition with BMI z-scores.

In this system, the simultaneous detection of temperature-, pressure- and sweat-based glucose level by means of full custom microfabricated sensors distributed on eight reading points of a smart insole will be possible, and the unit for data acquisition and wireless transmission will be fully integrated into the platform. Finite element analysis simulations, based on an accurate bioheat transfer model of the metabolic response of the foot tissue, demonstrated that subcutaneous inflamed lesions located up to the muscle layer, and ischemic damage located not below the reticular/fat layer, can be successfully detected. The microfabrication processes and preliminary results of functional characterization of flexible piezoelectric pressure sensors and glucose sensors are presented. Full custom pressure sensors generate an electric charge in the range 0-20 pC, proportional to the applied load in the range 0-4 N, with a figure of merit of 4.7 \u00b1 1 GPa. The disposable glucose sensors exhibit a 0-6 mM (0-108 mg/dL) glucose concentration optimized linear response (for sweat-sensing), with a LOD of 3.27 \u00b5M (0.058 mg/dL) and a sensitivity of 21 \u00b5A/mM cm", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["ChiaraDe Pascali", "LucaFrancioso", "LuciaGiampetruzzi", "GabrieleRescio", "Maria AssuntaSignore", "AlessandroLeone", "PietroSiciliano"], "doi": "10.3390/s21051847\n10.1016/j.jvs.2011.02.006\n10.1016/B978-0-444-52902-2.00033-3\n10.1097/01.sap.0000122654.65588.f0\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103616\n10.1007/s00125-006-0491-1\n10.2337/diacare.21.10.1714\n10.1371/journal.pone.0099050\n10.1016/S1262-3636(07)70062-9\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01520.x\n10.1155/2019/7395769\n10.2337/diacare.22.12.1966\n10.1007/978-3-319-30808-1_39-1\n10.1186/s12902-016-0131-9\n10.3390/ijms17060917\n10.2337/dci19-0076\n10.1111/dme.13989\n10.1002/dmrr.3258\n10.5114/aoms.2010.13506\n10.3390/s20154316\n10.1115/1.4024572\n10.1016/b978-0-12-815028-3.00005-5\n10.11131/2016/101158\n10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2012.05.001\n10.3390/s140916212\n10.1109/MOBIHEALTH.2014.7015905\n10.1145/2735711.2735819\n10.12928/telkomnika.v15i4.7227\n10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513383\n10.1109/JSEN.2004.823671\n10.3390/s120709884\n10.1016/j.orgel.2015.04.020\n10.3390/s19245504\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2007.06.028\n10.1088/0967-3334/33/3/R33\n10.1177/193229681000400613\n10.2337/diacare.27.11.2642\n10.1111/j.1742-481X.2007.00378.x\n10.1097/01.prs.0000225459.93750.29\n10.1177/1932296819871270\n10.1155/2014/585306\n10.3390/s19040776\n10.2337/dc09-S062\n10.1038/emm.2016.6\n10.1155/2018/3086167\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.7345\n10.1007/s11136-008-9419-1\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112103\n10.1089/dia.2011.0262\n10.1039/C8LC01082J\n10.1002/adhm.201701150\n10.1016/j.aca.2012.03.043\n10.1016/j.talanta.2017.08.077\n10.3390/s18113617\n10.3390/electronics5030045\n10.1038/s41378-020-0171-1\n10.1177/193229681300700535\n10.1038/s41598-019-53713-1\n10.1155/2016/9213841\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.10.043\n10.1080/10803548.1999.11076432\n10.5923/j.textile.20170602.02\n10.1152/jappl.1948.1.2.93\n10.1186/1746-1596-9-36\n10.1088/0031-9155/55/19/020\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181851b55\n10.1007/s11517-009-0566-5\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181addb33\n10.1007/s10439-007-9384-9\n10.1140/epjst/e2019-800143-7\n10.1063/1.4800231\n10.31274/etd-180810-5300\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2008.02642.x\n10.3390/s18072038\n10.1016/j.aca.2018.05.051\n10.1002/elan.201600018"}
{"title": "Dual Piezoelectric Energy Investing and Harvesting Interface for High-Voltage Input.", "abstract": "A novel harvesting interface for multiple piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) is proposed for high-voltage energy harvesting. Pre-biasing a PZT prior to its mechanical deformation increases its damping force, resulting in higher energy extraction. Unlike the conventional harvesters where a PZT-generated output is assumed to be continuous sinusoidal and output polarity is assumed to be alternating every cycle, PZT-generated output from human motion is expected to be random. Therefore, in the proposed approach, energy is invested to the PZT only when PZT deformation is detected.

{"title": "Veterinary Drug Residues in Animal-Derived Foods: Sample Preparation and Analytical Methods.", "abstract": "Veterinary drugs are used to treat livestock and aquatic diseases and thus are introduced into animal-derived foods, endangering consumer health and safety. Antibiotic resistance is rapidly becoming a major worldwide problem, and there has been a steady increase in the number of pathogens that show multi-drug resistance. Illegal and excessive use of veterinary drugs in animals and aquaculture has serious adverse effects on humans and on all other environmental organisms. It is necessary to develop simple extraction methods and fast analytical methods to effectively detect veterinary drug residues in animal-derived foods.

Currently, various materials have been proposed and investigated as potential bionic leaves. However, the problems such as poor weather durability, heavy metal pollution, and complex preparation technology still persist. Herein, a bionic leaf is prepared from an ultramarine green pigment as the functional material, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the film-forming material, and LiCl as the humidizer. To prepare the ultramarine green pigment, the sulfur anion is added into the \u03b2 cage of the 4A zeolite. The mechanisms and properties were discussed based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and spectroscopic methods. The results show that the as-fabricated bionic leaf based on the 4A zeolite-derived ultramarine green pigment was able to demonstrate a high spectral similarity coefficient of 0.91 with the green leaf. Furthermore, the spectral similarity coefficient was increased to 0.94 after being subjected to a simulated rainforest environment for 48 h, which indicated its high weather durability.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["ChenglongLv", "MeiZu", "DongjinXie", "HaifengCheng"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14061406\n10.1104/pp.16.00592\n10.1007/s10853-020-04942-7\n10.1016/S0034-4257(02)00010-X\n10.2134/agronj1989.00021962008100010019x\n10.1016/S0034-4257(70)80021-9\n10.1364/AO.4.000011\n10.1023/A:1007033503276\n10.1016/S1672-6529(09)60216-X\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.06.051\n10.1049/el.2017.4647\n10.3390/nano9111641\n10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109716\n10.1016/j.infrared.2020.103342\n10.3788/AOS201737.0230004\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2012.07.050\n10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.05.011\n10.1007/s00269-016-0816-7\n10.1107/S0108270185005662\n10.1016/j.culher.2017.09.005\n10.1007/s11356-020-07624-8\n10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.108349\n10.1021/ic991419x\n10.1002/jrs.4101"}

To evaluate energy collecting efficiency of PEHs with various piezoelectric unit distributions, finite element (FE) models of the PEHs were developed in this study. The PEH was a square of 30 cm \u00d7 30 cm with 7 cm in thickness, which was designed according to the contact area between tire and pavement. Within the PEHs, piezoelectric ceramics (PZT-5H) were used as the core piezoelectric units in the PEHs. A total of three distributions of the piezoelectric units were considered, which were 3 \u00d7 3, 3 \u00d7 4, and 4 \u00d7 4, respectively. For each distribution, two diameters of the piezoelectric units were considered to investigate the influence of the cross section area. The electrical potential, total electrical energy and maximum von Mises stress were compared based on the computational results. Due to the non-uniformity of the stress distribution in PEHs, more electrical energy can be generated by more distributions and smaller diameters of the piezoelectric units; meanwhile, more piezoelectric unit distributions cause a higher electrical potential difference between the edge and center positions. For the same distribution, the piezoelectric units with smaller diameter produce higher electrical potential and energy, but also induce higher stress concentration in the piezoelectric units near the edge.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-04-04", "authors": ["CongDu", "PengfeiLiu", "HailuYang", "GengfuJiang", "LinbingWang", "MarkusOeser"], "doi": "10.3390/ma14061405\n10.1680/muen.12.00025\n10.3390/app7080801\n10.1109/TMAG.2009.2021671\n10.1063/1.3545798\n10.1088/0957-4484/26/16/165403\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.125\n10.1016/j.jtte.2020.08.001\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1063/1.1784890\n10.1557/PROC-736-D5.5\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab36e4\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.01.030\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.031\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002640\n10.1115/1.4044140\n10.1080/14680629.2017.1329873\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002079\n10.2109/jcersj2.118.909\n10.3390/ma13122770\n10.1016/S0045-7949(98)00237-5\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/4/043001"}

The lowest Water Vapor Permeability (WVP) value of PSRF exhibited a good barrier property for moisture. Therefore, PSRF film was used to monitor the griskin freshness.

{"title": "Low-powered implantable devices activated by ultrasonic energy transfer for physiological monitoring in soft tissue via functionalized electrochemical electrodes.", "abstract": "Ultrasounds (US) are one of the most used imaging techniques in medicine for assessing the physiological and pathological state of soft tissue. Apart from therapeutic applications, most of the interaction of the acoustic beams with tissues occur passively and without substantial modification to the physiology of the latter. However, US can also be used to remotely power implantable devices with sensing capabilities. In this study, we propose small-form devices interfaced with functionalized electrochemical electrodes for the detection of pH and lactate levels, powered by ultrasounds and data transmission through a Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation technique. A custom-made piezoelectric transducer is responsible for converting the acoustic waves into electrical voltage at the device with operational levels as low as 0.5\u00a0V (power consumption of 10\u00a0\u03bcW) obtained from implantation distances of 50\u00a0mm inside tissue. This conjugated with the high sensitivity of the developed electrochemical sensors allows to detect and transmit local parameter variations below 0.1 pH (4.2\u00a0mV) and 1\u00a0mM lactate (70\u00a0nA). Potential applications include real-time access to intrabody tissue monitoring post-operatively, with the view of assessing proper soft tissue healing or infection detection by bacteria, as well as tissue cancer screening in structures such as the human breast.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2021-04-03", "authors": ["BGil", "SAnastasova", "G-ZYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2021.113175"}
{"title": "Field-deployable measurement technique for absolute acoustic nonlinearity parameter values.", "abstract": "Over the past two decades, several researchers have demonstrated that changes in the acoustic nonlinearity parameter \u03b2 can be related to changes in material properties due to mechanical and/or thermal degradation processes. Generally, a piezoelectric sensor-based detection method is used to measure changes in \u03b2 values because it is operationally simpler than the complex capacitive detection method. However, this method is limited to measuring only relative changes in \u03b2 values; whereas, the absolute \u03b2 values of components in service often need to be measured in the field to quantify the degradation level. Accordingly, a novel field-deployable method for measuring absolute \u03b2 values was developed in this study. Nonlinear ultrasonic experiments were conducted using capacitive detection, conventional piezoelectric sensor-based detection, and proposed detection methods, and the results were compared. The \u03b2 values of a copper single-crystal sample measured using the new and the capacitive detection methods were 2.49 and 2.1, respectively, and those obtained using the conventional piezoelectric sensor-based detection method ranged between 90 and 130. The test results confirm that the proposed field-deployable measurement method produces more consistent absolute \u03b2 values without involving the complexity of the capacitive detection method.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-04-03", "authors": ["ToKang", "Jeong KNa", "TackgyuLee", "Sung-JinSong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106421"}

Since many crystalline biopolymers have noncentrosymmetric structures, there has been a great deal of interest in exploiting their piezoelectric and SHG responses for electromechanical and electro-optic devices, especially owing to their advantages such as biocompatibility and low density. However, exact mechanisms or origins of such polarization responses of crystalline biopolymers remain elusive due to the convolution of responses from multiple domains with varying degrees of structural disorder or difficulty of ensuring the unidirectional alignment of noncentrosymmetric domains.

{"title": "Laser-generated focused ultrasound transducer using a perforated photoacoustic lens for tissue characterization.", "abstract": "We demonstrate a laser-generated focused ultrasound (LGFU) transducer using a perforated-photoacoustic (PA) lens and a piezoelectric probe hydrophone suitable for high-frequency ultrasound tissue characterization. The perforated-PA lens employed a centrally located hydrophone to achieve a maximum directional response at 0\u00b0 from the axial direction of the lens. Under pulsed laser irradiation, the lens produced LGFU pulses with a frequency bandwidth of 6-30 MHz and high-peak pressure amplitudes of up to 46.5 MPa at a 70-\u00b5m lateral focal width. Since the hydrophone capable of covering the transmitter frequency range (\u223c20 MHz) was integrated with the lens, this hybrid transducer differentiated tissue elasticity by generating and detecting high-frequency ultrasound signals. Backscattered (BS) waves from excised tissues (bone, skin, muscle, and fat) were measured and also confirmed by laser-flash shadowgraphy. We characterized the LGFU-BS signals in terms of mean frequency and spectral energy in the frequency domain, enabling to clearly differentiate tissue types. Tissue characterization was also performed with respect to the LGFU penetration depth (from the surface, 1-, and 2-mm depth). Despite acoustic attenuation over the penetration depth, LGFU-BS characterization shows consistent results that can differentiate the elastic properties of tissues. We expect that the proposed transducer can be utilized for other tissue types and also for non-destructive evaluation based on the elasticity of unknown materials.", "journal": "Biomedical optics express", "date": "2021-04-03", "authors": ["JeongminHeo", "DeblinaBiswas", "Kyu KwanPark", "DongheeSon", "Hui JoonPark", "Hyoung WonBaac"], "doi": "10.1364/BOE.416884\n10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2513958\n10.1148/radiol.11110670\n10.7863/jum.2012.31.4.623\n10.1097/PHM.0b013e31822419ba\n10.1016/S0021-9290(03)00163-5\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.05.021\n10.1118/1.4852875\n10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkr030\n10.1007/s10439-015-1515-0\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.06.015\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2003.07.001\n10.1016/j.media.2014.11.009\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.03.018\n10.1088/0031-9155/50/8/001\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.03.012\n10.14740/jocmr2625w\n10.1016/j.jhep.2010.06.022\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2013.04.019\n10.1002/hep.25756\n10.1148/radiol.10091662\n10.2174/157340511798038684\n10.1038/srep00989\n10.1002/adom.201800491\n10.1121/1.2166708\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.044007\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.03.004\n10.1063/1.5093698\n10.1063/1.4974954\n10.1016/S1050-6411(00)00046-8\n10.1364/OE.26.021700\n10.1364/OL.44.006005\n10.1002/smll.201701555\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.09.004\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.01.028\n10.1063/1.4943369\n10.1016/S0301-5629(01)00463-X\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.870\n10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2496862\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.11.009\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.04.007\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2014.01.022\n10.7863/jum.2010.29.3.387\n10.3390/diagnostics10030133\n10.1016/0301-5629(95)00049-6\n10.1021/acsphotonics.0c01313\n10.2478/pomr-2020-0040\n10.1016/j.prostr.2017.07.036"}

{"title": "Strategies for Alleviating Electrode Expansion of Graphite Electrodes in Sodium-Ion Batteries Followed by In Situ Electrochemical Dilatometry.", "abstract": "The electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of solvated sodium ions into graphite is a highly reversible process, but leads to large, undesired electrode expansion/shrinkage (\"breathing\"). Herein, two strategies to mitigate the electrode expansion are studied. Starting with the standard configuration (-) sodium | diglyme (2G) electrolyte | graphite (poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder) (+), the PVDF binder is first replaced with a binder made of the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Second, ethylenediamine (EN) is added to the electrolyte solution as a co-solvent. The electrode breathing is followed in\u2009situ (operando) through electrochemical dilatometry (ECD). It is found that replacing PVDF with CMC is only effective in reducing the electrode expansion during initial sodiation. During cycling, the electrode breathing for both binders is comparable. Much more effective is the addition of EN. The addition of 10\u2009v/v EN to the diglyme electrolyte strongly reduces the electrode expansion during the initial sodiation (+100% with EN versus +175% without EN) as well as the breathing during cycling. A more detailed analysis of the ECD signals reveals that solvent co-intercalation temporarily leads to pillaring of the graphite lattice and that the addition of EN to 2G leads to a change in the sodium storage mechanism.", "journal": "Energy technology (Weinheim, Germany)", "date": "2021-04-02", "authors": ["InesEscher", "YuliiaKravets", "Guillermo AFerrero", "MustafaGoktas", "PhilippAdelhelm"], "doi": "10.1002/ente.202000880"}

{"title": "Gate-controlled amplifiable ultraviolet AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility phototransistor.", "abstract": "Gate-controlled amplifiable ultraviolet phototransistors have been demonstrated using AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) with very thin AlGaN barriers. In the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, the dark current between the source and drain increases with increasing thickness of the AlGaN barrier from 10 to 30\u00a0nm owing to the increase in piezoelectric polarization-induced two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG). However, the photocurrent of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT decreases with increasing thickness of the AlGaN barrier under ultraviolet exposure conditions. It can be observed that a thicker AlGaN barrier exhibits a much higher 2-DEG than the photogenerated carriers at the interface between AlGaN and GaN. In addition, regardless of the AlGaN barrier thickness, the source-drain dark current increases as the gate bias increases from -\u00a01.0 to\u2009+\u20091.0\u00a0V. However, the photocurrent of the phototransistor with the 30\u00a0nm thick AlGaN barrier was not affected by the gate bias, whereas that of the phototransistor with 10\u00a0nm thick AlGaN barrier was amplified from reduction of the gate bias. From these results, we suggest that by controlling the gate bias, a thin AlGaN barrier can amplify/attenuate the photocurrent of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT-based phototransistor.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-04-01", "authors": ["Seung-HyeBaek", "Gun-WooLee", "Chu-YoungCho", "Sung-NamLee"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-86575-7\n10.1063/1.4906459\n10.1002/adma.201301640\n10.1063/1.2965113\n10.1109/LPT.2013.2248056\n10.1002/pssb.200675618\n10.3938/jkps.75.362\n10.1002/adma.201103470\n10.1063/1.1394717\n10.1109/TIE.2011.2161059\n10.1016/S0022-0248(01)01467-1\n10.1002/pssa.200674735\n10.1109/LED.2016.2626388\n10.1109/55.767097\n10.1063/1.4999810\n10.1063/1.124712\n10.1016/S0022-0248(01)01305-7\n10.1049/el:19950247\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2531181\n10.1063/1.5040295\n10.1016/S0038-1101(03)00246-6\n10.1049/el:20031132\n10.1063/1.3453871\n10.1063/1.3595303\n10.5573/JSTS.2019.19.2.184\n10.1109/TED.2013.2273618\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2594185\n10.1103/PhysRevA.43.3161\n10.1016/S0921-5107(02)00039-9\n10.1364/OME.4.001030\n10.1063/1.1334923\n10.1109/JPROC.2002.1021567\n10.1002/pip.496\n10.1021/nl070111x\n10.1088/0268-1242/30/10/105007\n10.5573/JSTS.2019.19.6.540\n10.1063/1.4982354"}

{"title": "Degradation resistance of PVDF mesh in vivo in comparison to PP mesh.", "abstract": "Mesh implant has been applied in hernia repair and urogynecological reconstruction. Polypropylene (PP) is now the most widely used material for non-resorbable mesh implants. A degradation phenomenon of PP mesh, which is apparent on the mesh surface as cracking, flaking and peeling, was discovered in the 1990's. This phenomenon of mesh implant has drawn attention because of mesh-related litigations. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), due to its high biocompatible performance, has been used since 2003 as an alternative material for non-resorbable mesh implants. Till now, no such degradation phenomenon of PVDF mesh has been reported, although limited study on PVDF mesh is available. In this paper, we researched the degradation of PVDF meshes taking the degradation of PP mesh as a reference. The meshes analysed in this study were received from a previous animal experiment. To expose the surface of explanted meshes, a tissue removing method with protease was used and the result of this cleaning process was tested by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The morphological condition of the mesh surface was compared using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the chemical condition concerning degradation was analysed through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The surface condition of PVDF mesh after 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month implantation was illustrated and compared with two types of PP meshes. XPS revealed an absence of nitrogen, confirming the successful removal of tissue residues using protease. SEM results presented no notable morphological surface change of the PVDF mesh and progressive surface cracking processes over time of both types of PP meshes. FTIR spectra of the implanted PVDF meshes had no considerable difference from the spectrum of the pristine mesh, while FTIR spectra of both types of PP meshes had extra chemical functional groups (carbonyl (CO) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups) increasing with implantation time, indicating progressive degradation. This study highlights the morphological and chemical stability of the PVDF mesh and demonstrates that the PVDF mesh is more resistant to degradation in comparison to the other two types of PP meshes.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2021-03-30", "authors": ["HongshiWang", "BerndKlosterhalfen", "AndreasM\u00fcllen", "ThomasOtto", "AxelDievernich", "StefanJockenh\u00f6vel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104490"}

{"title": "Ternary Phase-Field Simulations of the Skin-Sublayer Structures in Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Microporous Membranes Prepared by a Nonsolvent-Induced Phase Separation.", "abstract": "In this paper, the existing phase-field model based on the nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) method was optimized. Two-dimensional simulations using the relevant parameters of a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane system were carried out, simulating and analyzing the effects of changes in initial concentrations, concentration fluctuations, and diffusion rates of the solvent on the skin layer and sublayer structures of the membranes. These simulations modeled the process of preparing PVDF microporous membranes by the NIPS method to better understand the structural development of PVDF microporous membranes under different conditions. It was found that dense skin layers were formed at the mass-transfer exchange interface of the PVDF microporous membranes, whose number increased with the decrease of the concentration fluctuation, which has little effect on the structure of the sublayer.

Fouling may be mitigated by pretreating feed waters; however, there are no comprehensive studies that compare the fouling reduction efficacies across different pretreatment processes. Further, there is a limited understanding of the relationship between fouling reduction efficacy and microbially-derived DOM removal from source waters. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate and compare the efficacies of five pretreatment processes in reducing UF membrane fouling by DOM; and (ii) investigate whether a relationship exists between membrane fouling reduction and microbially-derived DOM removal by pretreatment processes. We investigated seven water sources and a polyvinylidene fluoride hollow-fiber UF membrane using bench-scale fouling tests. Dissolved organic carbon content, ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy were used to assess DOM concentration and composition. Alum and ferric chloride coagulation were the most effective pretreatment processes in reducing membrane fouling, anion exchange was moderately effective, and PAC adsorption and chlorine pre-oxidation were the least effective. Consistent with previous studies, microbially-derived DOM was the major contributor to UF membrane fouling regardless of water source or pretreatment type. Fouling reduction was strongly correlated with the reduction of microbially-derived DOM in foulant layers but not from source waters. This result indicates that a fraction of the total microbially-derived DOM in feed waters was responsible for UF fouling. Overall, pretreatment processes that remove microbially-derived DOM are well-suited for UF membrane fouling reduction.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2021-03-29", "authors": ["PanitanJutaporn", "Rose MCory", "Philip CSinger", "OrlandoCoronell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130284"}

{"title": "Transcriptional profiling of identified neurons in leech.", "abstract": "While leeches in the genus Hirudo have long been models for neurobiology, the molecular underpinnings of nervous system structure and function in this group remain largely unknown. To begin to bridge this gap, we performed RNASeq on pools of identified neurons of the central nervous system (CNS): sensory T (touch), P (pressure) and N (nociception) neurons; neurosecretory Retzius cells; and ganglia from which these four cell types had been removed.\nBioinformatic analyses identified 3565 putative genes whose expression differed significantly among the samples. These genes clustered into 9 groups which could be associated with one or more of the identified cell types. We verified predicted expression patterns through in situ hybridization on whole CNS ganglia, and found that orthologous genes were for the most part similarly expressed in a divergent leech genus, suggesting evolutionarily conserved roles for these genes. Transcriptional profiling allowed us to identify candidate phenotype-defining genes from expanded gene families. Thus, we identified one of eight hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide gated (HCN) channels as a candidate for mediating the prominent sag current in P neurons, and found that one of five inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), representing a sub-family of IP3Rs absent from vertebrate genomes, is expressed with high specificity in T cells. We also identified one of two piezo genes, two of ~\u200965\u2009deg/enac genes, and one of at least 16 transient receptor potential (trp) genes as prime candidates for involvement in sensory transduction in the three distinct classes of leech mechanosensory neurons.\nOur study defines distinct transcriptional profiles for four different neuronal types within the leech CNS, in addition to providing a second ganglionic transcriptome for the species.

The actuating principles used in current systems rely on either cavity modes in enclosures or complex arrangements for phase control. Therefore, available systems either require high power inputs and costly peripheral equipment or sacrifice flexibility. This work presents a different concept for acoustic trapping of particles and cells that enables dynamically defined trapping patterns inside a simple and inexpensive setup. Here, dynamic operation and dexterous trapping are realized through the use of a modified piezoelectric transducer in direct contact with the liquid sample. Physical modeling shows how the transducer induces an acoustic force potential where the conventional trapping in the axial direction is supplemented by surface displacement dependent lateral trapping. The lateral field is a horizontal array of pronounced potential minima with frequency-dependent locations. The resulting system enables dynamic arraying of levitated trapping sites at low power and can be manufactured at ultra-low cost, operated using low-cost electronics, and assembled in less than 5\u2009min.

Therefore, the methods of detection for its authentication is an important issue.\nWe suggest colorimetric sensor array and chemometric methods to discriminate natural Rosa distillate from synthetic adulterates.\nThe colour responses of 20 indicators spotted on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrate were monitored with a flatbed scanner; then their digital representation was analysed with principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA).\nAccurate discrimination of the diluted- and synthetic-mixture samples from the original ones was achieved by PLS-DA and SIMCA models with error rate of 0.01 and 0, specificity of 0.98 and 1, sensitivity of 1 and 1, and accuracy of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. Discrimination of the synthetic adulterate from the original samples was achieved with error rate of 0.03 and 0.03, specificity of 0.94 and 0.93, sensitivity of 1 and 1, and accuracy of 0.93 and 0.71 with PLS-DA and SIMCA models, respectively. Moreover, the chemical constituents of the samples were analysed using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main constituents of the distillate were geraniol, citronellol, and phenylethyl alcohol in different percentages, in both original and synthetic adulterate samples.\nThese results point out the successful combination of colorimetric sensor array and PLS-DA and SIMCA as a fast, sensitive and inexpensive screening tool for discrimination of original samples of R. damascena Mill distillate from those prepared from synthetic Rosa essential oils.", "journal": "Phytochemical analysis : PCA", "date": "2021-03-25", "authors": ["MarjanMahboubifar", "BahramHemmateenejad", "Amir RezaJassbi"], "doi": "10.1002/pca.3044"}

We used a 37\u00a0\u00b0C water bath; temperature was monitored with a thermocouple/data-logger. Representative sets of settings were examined for both devices, including short and long pulse lengths where applicable. For each setting, ten force values were recorded by a low-force precision piezo sensor whereby the laser fibre was either brought into contact with the sensor or placed at a 3\u00a0mm distance.\nThe mean retropulsion forces resulting from the new Tm:YAG device were significantly lower than those of the Ho:YAG device under all pulse energy and frequency settings, ranging between 0.92 and 19.60\u00a0N for Thulium and 8.09-39.67\u00a0N for Holmium. The contact setups yielded lower forces than the distance setups. The forces increased with increasing pulse energy settings while shorter pulse lengths led to 12-44% higher retropulsive force in the 2.0\u00a0J/5\u00a0Hz comparisons.\nThe Tm:YAG device not only significantly generated lower retropulsion forces in all comparisons to Holmium at corresponding settings but also offers adjustment options to achieve lower energy pulses and longer pulse durations to produce even lower retropulsion.

{"title": "The effect of a transducer's spatial averaging on an elastodynamic guided wave's wavenumber spectrum.", "abstract": "Elastodynamic guided waves propagate in an elastic solid which makes it difficult, if not impractical, to place a receiving transducer in the direct path of the propagating wave (as one would for an acoustic wave in a fluid medium). To account for this, receiving transducers are often placed on the surface of the solid waveguide such that the transducer surface is parallel to the wave propagation direction. This transducer orientation introduces spatial averaging, which causes the received signal to have an altered signal amplitude and mode bias. We investigate both of these effects and present a simple model from which we derive a scaling-ratio expression that describes the effects of spatial averaging. We then test its performance using finite-element simulations that incorporate \"real-world\" assumptions (e.g., transient waves, piezoelectric effects, etc.). The results from the simulations demonstrate that the scaling-ratio can characterize the effects resulting from spatial averaging. The scaling-ratio expression will be particularly useful when designing experiments involving high frequency (small wavelength) guided waves. Lastly, the proposed scaling-ratio expression could be applied to other sensing methods, like Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) or piezoelectric waveguides with inter-digitated transducers, because of its generality. However, the authors are careful to note that the scaling-ratio expression is not intended as a replacement of multi-physics analysis or good experimental design, and the effects of spatial averaging should be avoided whenever possible.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-03-24", "authors": ["ChristopherHakoda", "Vamshi KrishnaChillara", "CristianPantea"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106422"}
{"title": "Ultrasonic wireless power links for battery-free condition monitoring in metallic enclosures.", "abstract": "This paper presented a novel ultrasonic wireless power link (UWPL) to provide power supply for embedded condition monitoring of enclosed metallic structures, where recharging or replacing batteries can be problematic. Two piezoelectric transducers are adopted to establish the wireless power links, within which one transducer is used to generate ultrasonic waves and the other is to receive the transferred ultrasonic energy and to energize the associated embedded condition monitoring units. A power management solution is established to regulate the receiver output into a constant voltage suitable for sensing application. A theoretical model was established to understand the UWPL dynamics and to analyze the energy budget balance between the UWPL and the sensing power demands. A finite element model was built to validate the proposed idea. The UWPL was then experimentally implemented using two piezoelectric transducers and tested in aluminium plates with different thickness. A power management sub-system was developed and tested for sensing applications. An output power of 1.73\u00a0mW was obtained on a 1.5\u00a0k\u03a9 resister with the input voltage of 15\u00a0V at 42.6\u00a0kHz through a 6\u00a0mm-thick aluminium plate.

{"title": "Gas-Phase Temperature Mapping of Evaporating Microdroplets.", "abstract": "Evaporation is a ubiquitous and complex phenomenon of importance to many natural and industrial systems. Evaporation occurs when molecules near the free interface overcome intermolecular attractions with the bulk liquid. As molecules escape the liquid phase, heat is removed, causing evaporative cooling. The influence of evaporative cooling on inducing a temperature difference with the surrounding atmosphere as well as within the liquid is poorly understood. Here, we develop a technique to overcome past difficulties encountered during the study of heterogeneous droplet evaporation by coupling a piezo-driven droplet generation mechanism to a controlled micro-thermocouple to probe microdroplet evaporation. The technique allowed us to probe the gas-phase temperature distribution using a micro-thermocouple (50 \u03bcm) in the vicinity of the liquid-vapor interface with high spatial (\u00b110 \u03bcm) and temporal (\u00b1100 ms) resolution.

The study of the microscopic structure of ferroelectric HfO2 capacitors is crucial to get insights into the device behavior and performance. However, a small $d_{33}^\\ast$ of ferroelectric HfO2 films leads to a low piezoresponse, especially in band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy (BE-PFM). In this work, we have implemented the BE-PFM technique with an increased scanning rate, thus improving this versatile tool for weak ferroelectrics. The acceleration of measurement was achieved by focusing excitation into a narrow frequency band and tuning the central frequency on-the-fly using an online real-time model estimation by fitting a complex BE response. The tracking of the contact resonance frequency was implemented using a pure mechanical cantilever response acquired in BE atomic force acoustic microscopy. To obtain optimal excitation parameters, we perform statistical analysis by minimizing estimator variance.

{"title": "The strain-generated electrical potential in cartilaginous tissues: a role for piezoelectricity.", "abstract": "The strain-generated potential (SGP) is a well-established mechanism in cartilaginous tissues whereby mechanical forces generate electrical potentials. In articular cartilage (AC) and the intervertebral disc (IVD), studies on the SGP have focused on fluid- and ionic-driven effects, namely Donnan, diffusion and streaming potentials. However, recent evidence has indicated a direct coupling between strain and electrical potential. Piezoelectricity is one such mechanism whereby deformation of most biological structures, like collagen, can directly generate an electrical potential. In this review, the SGP in AC and the IVD will be revisited in light of piezoelectricity and mechanotransduction. While the evidence base for physiologically significant piezoelectric responses in tissue is lacking, difficulties in quantifying the physiological response and imperfect measurement techniques may have underestimated the property. Hindering our understanding of the SGP further, numerical models to-date have negated ferroelectric effects in the SGP and have utilised classic Donnan theory that, as evidence argues, may be oversimplified. Moreover, changes in the SGP with degeneration due to an altered extracellular matrix (ECM) indicate that the significance of ionic-driven mechanisms may diminish relative to the piezoelectric response.

{"title": "Finite element analysis of bone remodelling with piezoelectric effects using an open-source framework.", "abstract": "Bone tissue exhibits piezoelectric properties and thus is capable of transforming mechanical stress into electrical potential. Piezoelectricity has been shown to play a vital role in bone adaptation and remodelling processes. Therefore, to better understand the interplay between mechanical and electrical stimulation during these processes, strain-adaptive bone remodelling models without and with considering the piezoelectric effect were simulated using the Python-based open-source software framework. To discretise numerical attributes, the finite element method (FEM) was used for the spatial variables and an explicit Euler scheme for the temporal derivatives. The predicted bone apparent density distributions were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated against the radiographic scan of a human proximal femur and the bone apparent density calculated using a bone mineral density (BMD) calibration phantom, respectively. Additionally, the effect of the initial bone density on the resulting predicted density distribution was investigated globally and locally. The simulation results showed that the electrically stimulated bone surface enhanced bone deposition and these are in good agreement with previous findings from the literature. Moreover, mechanical stimuli due to daily physical activities could be supported by therapeutic electrical stimulation to reduce bone loss in case of physical impairment or osteoporosis.

The chemically purified cellulose was isolated from different parts of coconut (coconut shell and its husk) and further subjected to 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation for CNF preparation. Physicochemical properties of prepared CNFs were studied in terms of chemical characteristics & crystallinity, surface functionalities, surface morphology, and thermal properties. Both coconut shell-derived CNF and coconut husk-derived CNF fulfilled with nanocellulose's characteristics with fibres width ranged of 70-120\u00a0nm and 150-330\u00a0nm, respectively. CNF films were further prepared by solvent casting method to measure the modulus elasticity, piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the films. Mechanical study indicated that coconut shell-derived CNF film showed a higher value of elastic modulus than the coconut husk-derived CNF film, which was 8.39\u00a0GPa and 5.36\u00a0GPa, respectively.

Deep learning algorithms can be used to extract hidden cell features from high-content image information to enable the discrimination of cell-to-cell differences in image-activated cell sorters. However, such systems are challenging to implement from a technical perspective due to the advanced imaging and sorting requirements and the long processing times of deep learning algorithms. Here, we introduce a user-friendly image-activated microfluidic sorting technique based on a fast deep learning model under the TensorRT framework to enable sorting decisions within 3 ms. The proposed sorter employs a significantly simplified operational procedure based on the use of a syringe connected to a piezoelectric actuator. The sorter has a 2.5 ms latency. The utility of the sorter was demonstrated through real-time sorting of fluorescent polystyrene beads and cells. The sorter achieved 98.0%, 95.1%, and 94.2% sorting purities for 15 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm beads, HL-60 and Jurkat cells, and HL-60 and K562 cells, respectively, with a throughput of up to 82.8 events per second (eps).", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2021-03-19", "authors": ["KeondoLee", "Seong-EunKim", "JunsangDoh", "KeehoonKim", "Wan KyunChung"], "doi": "10.1039/d0lc00747a"}

Firstly, the basic principle and structure of hybrid drive motor are introduced. The air gap magnetic field model and electromagnetic torque model of permanent magnet rotor are obtained by analytical method. Static analysis of piezoelectric stators are carried out by stress-strain relationship. According to the analytical method and the spatial geometric relationship, the piezoelectric driving torque under different driving conditions is obtained. Introducing Hertz contact theory and Mindlin theory, combined with piezoelectric driving torque, electromagnetic driving torque and load torque to analyze the friction situation. A friction interface model considering the dynamic nonlinearity of friction coefficient and the nonlinear change of friction force distribution is established. Finally, using Matlab software, the friction distribution diagram of the contact surface of the hybrid drive three-degree-of-freedom motor under different driving and motion states is obtained. The analysis results verify the rationality of the electromagnetic piezoelectric hybrid driven three-degree-of-freedom motor. It shows that the contact state of the three sets of piezoelectric stators are determined according to the driving condition and load, the relative speed of the piezoelectric stators and the spherical rotor is proportional to the frictional force.

{"title": "Ionic Liquid-Assisted 3D Printing of Self-Polarized \u03b2-PVDF for Flexible Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies have unparalleled advantages in constructing piezoelectric devices with three-dimensional structures, which are conducive to improving the efficiency of energy harvesting. Among them, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is the most widely used thanks to its low cost and wide range of molding materials. However, as the best piezoelectric polymer, a high electroactive \u03b2-phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) piezoelectric device cannot be directly obtained by FDM printing because the \u03b2-crystal is unstable at the molten state. Herein, we develop for the first time ionic liquid (IL)-assisted FDM for direct printing of \u03b2-PVDF piezoelectric devices. An IL can induce and maintain \u03b2 crystals during melt extrusion and FDM printing, ensuring that the \u03b2-crystal in the printed PVDF device is as high as 98.3%, which is the highest in 3D-printed PVDF as far as we know. Furthermore, the shearing force provided by the FDM facilitates the directional arrangement of the dipoles, resulting in the printed PVDF device having self-polarization characteristics without poling. Finally, the piezoelectric output voltage of the 3D-printed PVDF device is 4.7 times that of the flat PVDF device, and its area current density (17.5 nA cm", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2021-03-18", "authors": ["XingangLiu", "YinghaoShang", "JihaiZhang", "ChuhongZhang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.1c03226"}
{"title": "Triboelectric Nanogenerators and Hybridized Systems for Enabling Next-Generation IoT Applications.", "abstract": "In the past few years, triboelectric nanogenerator-based (TENG-based) hybrid generators and systems have experienced a widespread and flourishing development, ranging among almost every aspect of our lives, e.g., from industry to consumer, outdoor to indoor, and wearable to implantable applications. Although TENG technology has been extensively investigated for mechanical energy harvesting, most developed TENGs still have limitations of small output current, unstable power generation, and low energy utilization rate of multisource energies. To harvest the ubiquitous/coexisted energy forms including mechanical, thermal, and solar energy simultaneously, a promising direction is to integrate TENG with other transducing mechanisms, e.g., electromagnetic generator, piezoelectric nanogenerator, pyroelectric nanogenerator, thermoelectric generator, and solar cell, forming the hybrid generator for synergetic single-source and multisource energy harvesting. The resultant TENG-based hybrid generators utilizing integrated transducing mechanisms are able to compensate for the shortcomings of each mechanism and overcome the above limitations, toward achieving a maximum, reliable, and stable output generation. Hence, in this review, we systematically introduce the key technologies of the TENG-based hybrid generators and hybridized systems, in the aspects of operation principles, structure designs, optimization strategies, power management, and system integration. The recent progress of TENG-based hybrid generators and hybridized systems for the outdoor, indoor, wearable, and implantable applications is also provided. Lastly, we discuss our perspectives on the future development trend of hybrid generators and hybridized systems in environmental monitoring, human activity sensation, human-machine interaction, smart

{"title": "Tunable fiber Fabry-Perot cavities with high passive stability.", "abstract": "We present three high finesse tunable monolithic fiber Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) with high passive mechanical stability. The fiber mirrors are fixed inside slotted glass ferrules, which guarantee an inherent alignment of the resonators. An attached piezoelectric element enables fast tuning of the FFPC resonance frequency over the entire free-spectral range for two of the designs. Stable locking of the cavity resonance is achieved for sub-Hertz feedback bandwidths, demonstrating the high passive stability. At the other limit, locking bandwidths up to tens of kilohertz, close to the first mechanical resonance, can be obtained. The root-mean-square frequency fluctuations are suppressed down to \u223c2% of the cavity linewidth. Over a wide frequency range, the frequency noise is dominated by the thermal noise limit of the system's mechanical resonances. The demonstrated small footprint devices can be used advantageously in a broad range of applications like cavity-based sensing techniques, optical filters or quantum light-matter interfaces.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2021-03-18", "authors": ["CarlosSaavedra", "DeepakPandey", "WolfgangAlt", "HannesPfeifer", "DieterMeschede"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.412273"}

We use our improved AFR for first-order Doppler-shift suppression in precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen, but our setup can be adapted to other applications where wavefront-retracing beams with defined laser polarization are important. We demonstrate how weak aberrations produced by the fiber collimator may remain unobserved in the intensity of the collimated beam but limit the performance of the AFR. Our general results on characterizing these aberrations with a caustic measurement can be applied to any system where a collimated high-quality laser beam is required.

A few methodological strategies have been developed that support these \"time-resolved\" studies, one of which, Spotiton-a novel robotic system-combines the dispensing of picoliter-sized sample droplets with precise temporal and spatial control. The time-resolved Spotiton workflow offers a uniquely efficient approach to interrogate early structural rearrangements from minimal sample volume. Fired from independently controlled piezoelectric dispensers, two samples land and rapidly mix on a nanowire EM grid as it plunges toward the cryogen. Potentially hundreds of grids can be prepared in rapid succession from only a few microliters of a sample.

{"title": "Electrospun nanofibers of polyvinylidene fluoride incorporated with titanium nanotubes for purifying air with bacterial contamination.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) blended with varying concentrations of titanium nanotubes (TNT) was electrospun to result in a nanocomposite filter media. Sandwich structures were obtained by depositing the electrospun fibers between polypropylene (PP) nonwoven sheets. The synthesized tubular TNT was confirmed for its morphology through a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The prepared filter media was analyzed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effectiveness of the filter media was evaluated through the zone of inhibition and antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. The Box-Behnken design is experimented with three-level variables, namely areal density of substrate (GSM), electrospinning time (hours), and concentration of TNT (wt%) for investigating the bacterial filtration efficiency through an Andersen sampler. Among other statistical tests (STATs), PVDF + 15 wt% TNT has a bacterial filtration efficiency of 99.88% providing greater potentials upon application for clean air management. It can be noted that the future application of this formulation could be efficient filtration of other microbes and could be used in facemasks to industrial-scale air filters.

However, most available wearable healthcare sensors are rigid, bulky, and incapable of recognizing the full range of human motions. Here, we propose a kirigami-structured highly anisotropic piezoelectric network composite sensor that is able to monitor multiple information of joint motions, including bending direction, bending radius, and motion modes, and to distinguish them simultaneously within one sensor unit.

{"title": "Mechanotendography: description and evaluation of a novel method for investigating the physiological mechanical oscillations of tendons using a piezo-based measurement system.", "abstract": "The mechanotendography (MTG) is a method for analyzing the mechanical oscillations of tendons during muscular actions. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the technical reliability of a piezo-based measurement system used for MTG. The reliability measurements were performed by using audio samples played by a subwoofer. The thereby generated pressure waves were recorded by a piezo-based measurement system. An audio of 40 Hz sine oscillations and four different formerly in vivo recorded MTG-signals were converted into audio files and were used as test signals. Five trials with each audio were performed and one audio was used for repetition trials on another day. The signals' correlation was estimated by Spearman (MCC) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(3,1)), Cronbach's alpha (CA) and by mean distances (MD). All parameters were compared between repetition and randomized matched signals. The repetition trials show high correlations (MCC: 0.86 \u00b1 0.13, ICC: 0.89 \u00b1 0.12, CA: 0.98 \u00b1 0.03), low MD (0.03 \u00b1 0.03V) and differ significantly from the randomized matched signals (MCC: 0.15 \u00b1 0.10, ICC: 0.17 \u00b1 0.09, CA: 0.37 \u00b1 0.16, MD: 0.19 \u00b1 0.01V) (p = 0.001 - 0.043).

Over the past decade, biopolymer nanofibers (BPNFs) have become critical sustainable building blocks in energy-related fields because they have distinctive nanostructures and properties and can be obtained from abundant and renewable resources. This review summarizes recent advances in the use of BPNFs for NG development. We will begin by introducing various strategies for fabricating BPNFs with diverse structures and performances. Then, we will systematically present the utilization of polysaccharide and protein nanofibers for NGs. We will mainly focus on the use of BPNFs to generate bulk materials with tailored structures and properties for assembling of triboelectric and piezoelectric NGs. The use of BPNFs to construct NGs for the generation of electricity from moisture and osmosis is also discussed.

{"title": "Triangulated Cylinder Origami-Based Piezoelectric/Triboelectric Hybrid Generator to Harvest Coupled Axial and Rotational Motion.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are representative technologies that can harvest mechanical energy. In general, piezoelectric/triboelectric hybrid generators can harvest considerable energy with a limited input; however, PENGs and TENGs entail different requirements for harvesting energy. Specifically, PENGs produce a large output when a large mechanical strain is applied, and TENGs require a large surface area to produce a high power. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an innovative strategy in terms of the structural design to satisfy the requirements of both PENGs and TENGs. In this study, we developed a triangulated cylinder origami-based piezoelectric/triboelectric hybrid generator (TCO-HG) with an origami structure to enable effective energy harvesting.

Wood is an excellent \"green\" building material and, owing to its piezoelectric behavior, could enable direct conversion of mechanical energy into electricity. Although this phenomenon has been discovered decades ago, its exploitation as an energy source has been impaired by the ultralow piezoelectric output of native wood. Here, we demonstrate that, by enhancing the elastic compressibility of balsa wood through a facile, green, and sustainable fungal decay pretreatment, the piezoelectric output is increased over 55 times.

This new design creatively realizes the possibility to capture time information at the phase level in sound velocity measurement, which is hardly realized in the piezoelectric-effect-based methods. Utilizing the above principle and the derived mathematical calculation, the accuracy of sound velocity with good traceability can be obtained.

{"title": "Limits and Opportunities for Miniaturizing Ultrasonic Surgical Devices Based on a Langevin Transducer.", "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery offers opportunities for reduced morbidities, faster postoperative recovery, and reduced costs, and is a major focus of surgical device innovation. For ultrasonic surgical devices, which offer benefits of high precision, low force, and tissue selectivity in surgical procedures, there exist laparoscopic ultrasonic shears for minimally invasive surgeries that combine tissue cutting with vessel hemostasis and sealing functions. Another approach to laparoscopy that could enable new procedures, and increase the sites of surgeries that could be reached by an ultrasonic device, involves integrating a miniature ultrasonic tool with a flexible surgical robot. However, miniaturization presents challenges in delivering the ultrasonic vibrational energy required to cut hard and soft tissues, partly due to the concomitant small volume of piezoelectric material. This article aims to provide insights into the trade-offs between transducer size, volume of piezoceramic material, resonance frequency, and the achievable displacement amplitude of devices that, consistent with current ultrasonic surgical tools, are based on a bolted Langevin transducer (BLT) and tip. Different configurations of BLTs are studied, including a cascaded version, simple bar versions, and BLTs with different front mass geometries. Results show that a BLT with a larger number of piezoceramic rings exhibits a higher coupling coefficient [Formula: see text] but with the compromise of a lower mechanical Q and stronger nonlinear response at increasing excitation levels. Displacement amplitude is reduced considerably when a BLT is excited at a higher harmonic, where the PZT rings are maintained at a nodal plane, and the resonance frequency shift at increasing excitation levels increases significantly. The electromechanical and dynamic characteristics of a cascaded transducer excited in its third longitudinal mode (L3) are almost equivalent to a much shorter version of a BLT driven at the same frequency but in its first longitudinal mode (L1), showing that a cascaded BLT can be a realistic proxy for studying the dynamics of small BLT devices. A new figure of merit is proposed that is the product of Q , [Formula: see text], and gain, which [Formula: see text] accounts for the gain of cylindrical BLTs which is shown not to be unity. It also proves effective as it incorporates the key factors affecting the achievable displacement amplitude of a BLT, including for BLTs with gain profiles in the front mass. The order of highest to lowest amplitude of a series of six gain-profile BLTs matches the order estimated by the figure of merit. It is shown that a BLT with a stepped profile front mass can achieve displacement that has the potential to cut hard or soft tissue and exhibits the smallest shifts in resonance frequency at increasing excitation levels.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-03-11", "authors": ["XuanLi", "ThomasStritch", "KevinManley", "MargaretLucas"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3065207"}

High flexibility arising from the small Young's modulus (60-70 N m-1) found in these Group-IV(A) Janus monolayers makes them suitable for large-scale strain engineering. Application of 7% uniaxial tensile strain increases d22 and d15 colossally to 267.07 pm V-1 and 702.34 pm V-1, respectively, thereby reaching the level of bulk piezoelectric perovskite materials. When the Janus GeSSe monolayers are stacked to form a van der Waals (vdW) homo-bilayer, d22 lies between 19.87 and 73.26 pm V-1, while d15 falls into the range between 83.01 and 604.34 pm V-1, depending on the stacking order. The chalcogen exchange energies and overall stabilities of the monolayers and bilayers confirm the feasibility of their experimental synthesis. Moreover, hole mobility in the GeSSe monolayer is greater than the electron mobility along its zigzag directions (\u03bce = 883 cm2 V-1 s-1 and \u03bch = 1134 cm2 V-1 s-1).

A cathode particle sample was mechanically separated from a LiB, cut into 30-mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a080-mm test pieces, and subjected to a high-voltage electrical pulse discharge from either end in water. At a voltage of 25\u00a0kV, 93.9% of the cathode particles separated from the Al foil. These particles were easily recovered by sieving at 2.36\u00a0mm because the Al foil retained its shape. Some Al contaminated the particles owing to generation of hot plasma and subsequent shock waves; however, the Al concentration in the recovered cathode particles was limited to 2.95%, which is low enough to allow for further cobalt and nickel recovery by hydrometallurgical processing. The results of heat balance calculations obtained from the current waveforms suggested that polyvinylidene fluoride, the main component of the adhesive in the cathode particle layers, melted and lost its adhesion through Joule heating of the Al foil at the maximum current of 19.0 kA at 25\u00a0kV.

Despite possessing a high piezoelectric constant, additives are required to increase the charge transfer from PVDF matrix to connected signal readout units. Many of these additives also stabilize the \u03b2-phase of PVDF, which is associated with highest piezoelectric coefficients. However, most of the additives used are often brittle ceramic-phase materials resulting in decreased flexibility of the devices and offsetting the gain in \u03b2-phase content. Intrinsically conducting polymers (ICP), on the other hand, are ideal candidates to improve the device-related properties of PVDF, due to their higher flexibility than ceramic fillers as well as ability to form conducting network in PVDF membranes. This work reports the performance and device feasibility of PVDF-polycarbazole (PCZ) electrospun nanofiber membranes. A higher \u03b2-phase was observed by FTIR spectroscopy in PVDF/PCZ compared to other PVDF phases. Moreover, a higher open-circuit potential was recorded over PVDF/polyaniline composites, which were studied for comparison. The addition of PCZ reduced the flexibility of pure PVDF nanofibers by 20% only. Besides, the work investigated the bacterial biofouling and cell compatibility of the matrix, as essential properties to examine any putative medical device application. PVDF/PCZ membranes were then used to develop a nanogenerator, which was capable of instantly lighting an entire LED array employing the rectified output power, and charged up a 2.2 \u03bcF capacitors using a bridge rectifier through a vertical compressive force applied periodically. Finally, the nanogenerator demonstrated electrical energy harvesting from movements of various parts of the human body, such as toe and heel movement and wrist bending.

In particular, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the urgent need for developing recyclable facemasks due to the considerable environmental damage and health risks imposed by disposable masks and respirators. We demonstrate synthesis of nanoporous membranes comprising carbon dots (C-dots) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and demonstrate their potential use for recyclable, self-sterilized facemasks. Notably, the composite C-dot-PVDF films exhibit hydrophobic surface which prevents moisture accumulation and a compact nanopore network which allows both breathability as well as effective filtration of particles above 100\u00a0nm in diameter. Particularly important, self-sterilization occurs upon short solar irradiation of the membrane, as the embedded C-dots efficiently absorb visible light, concurrently giving rise to elevated temperatures through heat dissipation.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2021-03-08", "authors": ["SeemaSingh", "NitzanShauloff", "Chetan PrakashSharma", "RanShimoni", "Christopher JArnusch", "RazJelinek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.049"}

{"title": "Gas-Coupled Laser Acoustic Detection technique for NDT of mechanical components.", "abstract": "The use of non-contact ultrasonic detection techniques is essential to develop an apparatus capable of inspecting components in service, operating in adverse environmental conditions or whose surfaces are challenging to access. Among these techniques, Gas-Coupled Laser Acoustic Detection (GCLAD) is based on measuring the deviation that a laser beam sustains when intersecting an ultrasonic wavefront. The method has been recently developed, being hence unestablished in the non-destructive testing (NDT) field. The objective of the present work is to expand knowledge on the physical operating principles of the GCLAD system; this is obtained by investigating, both theoretically and experimentally, the influence of specific working parameters on the detected signals with the aim of maximizing the ultrasonic amplitude. These analyses are essential for proposing effective non-destructive investigation methodologies benefitting from the employment of the GCLAD technique. Based on the information obtained and from an NDT standpoint, test configurations are proposed with a different relative arrangement between the GCLAD system and the structure; these configurations provide peculiar results also based on the type of wave under investigation (surface or bulk waves). Finally, to highlight the capabilities of the GCLAD system in inspections of mechanical pieces, signals detected experimentally on a component (i.e., a railway axle) are presented in the presence and absence of a surface defect.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-03-07", "authors": ["Michelangelo-SantoGulino", "MaraBruzzi", "DarioVangi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106415"}

{"title": "Research and Fabrication of Broadband Ring Flextensional Underwater Transducer.", "abstract": "At present, high-speed underwater acoustic communication requires underwater transducers with the characteristics of low frequency and broadband. The low-frequency transducers also are expected to be low-frequency directional for realization of point-to-point communication. In order to achieve the above targets, this paper proposes a new type of flextensional transducer which is constructed of double mosaic piezoelectric ceramic rings and spherical cap metal shells. The transducer realizes broadband transmission by means of the coupling between radial vibration of the piezoelectric rings and high-order flexural vibration of the spherical cap metal shells. The low-frequency directional transmission of the transducer is realized by using excitation signals with different amplitude and phase on two mosaic piezoelectric rings. The relationship between transmitting voltage response (TVR), resonance frequency and structural parameters of the transducer is analyzed by finite element software COMSOL. The broadband performance of the transducer is also optimized. On this basis, the low-frequency directivity of the transducer is further analyzed and the ratio of the excitation signals of the two piezoelectric rings is obtained. Finally, a prototype of the broadband ring flextensional underwater transducer is fabricated according to the results of simulation. The electroacoustic performance of the transducer is tested in an anechoic water tank. Experimental results show that the maximum TVR of the transducer is 147.2 dB and the operation bandwidth is 1.5-4 kHz, which means that the transducer has good low-frequency, broadband transmission capability. Meanwhile, cardioid directivity is obtained at 1.4 kHz and low-frequency directivity is realized.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-03-07", "authors": ["JiulingHu", "LianjinHong", "LiliYin", "YuLan", "HaoSun", "RongzhenGuo"], "doi": "10.3390/s21041548\n10.1121/1.416806\n10.1121/1.4743820\n10.3390/s18072102\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.01.016\n10.1016/0003-682X(70)90032-0\n10.1121/1.399507\n10.1049/ip-f-1.1984.0044\n10.1016/S0041-624X(99)00021-9\n10.3390/s18093128\n10.1073/pnas.1704450114\n10.3390/s19214659\n10.1121/1.1912539\n10.1109/ultsym.2008.0341\n10.1109/oceans.2003.178221\n10.1121/1.3437975\n10.1121/1.2722053\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2010.10.003\n10.1109/OCEANS.2000.881781"}
{"title": "Self-Powered Wireless Sensor Using a Pressure Fluctuation Energy Harvester.", "abstract": "Condition monitoring devices in hydraulic systems that use batteries or require wired infrastructure have drawbacks that affect their installation, maintenance costs, and deployment flexibility. Energy harvesting technologies can serve as an alternative power supply for system loads, eliminating batteries and wiring requirements. Despite the interest in pressure fluctuation energy harvesters, few studies consider end-to-end implementations, especially for cases with low-amplitude pressure fluctuations. This generates a research gap regarding the practical amount of energy available to the load under these conditions, as well as interface circuit requirements and techniques for efficient energy conversion. In this paper, we present a self-powered sensor that integrates an energy harvester and a wireless sensing system. The energy harvester converts pressure fluctuations in hydraulic systems into electrical energy using an acoustic resonator, a piezoelectric stack, and an interface circuit. The prototype wireless sensor consists of an industrial pressure sensor and a low-power Bluetooth System-on-chip that samples and wirelessly transmits pressure data. We present a subsystem analysis and a full system implementation that considers hydraulic systems with pressure fluctuation amplitudes of less than 1 bar and frequencies of less than 300 Hz. The study examines the frequency response of the energy harvester, the performance of the interface circuit, and the advantages of using an active power improvement unit adapted for piezoelectric stacks. We show that the interface circuit used improves the performance of the energy harvester compared to previous similar studies, showing more power generation compared to the standard interface. Experimental measurements show that the self-powered sensor system can start up by harvesting energy from pressure fluctuations with amplitudes starting at 0.2 bar at 200 Hz. It can also sample and transmit sensor data at a rate of 100 Hz at 0.7 bar at 200 Hz.

{"title": "Mechanical/Electrical Characterization of ZnO Nanomaterial Based on AFM/Nanomanipulator Embedded in SEM.", "abstract": "ZnO nanomaterials have been widely used in micro/nano devices and structure due to special mechanical/electrical properties, and its characterization is still deficient and challenging. In this paper, ZnO nanomaterials, including nanorod and nanowire are characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM) and nanomanipulator embedded in scanning electron microscope (SEM) respectively, which can manipulate and observe simultaneously, and is efficient and cost effective. Surface morphology and mechanical properties were observed by AFM. Results showed that the average Young's modulus of ZnO nanorods is 1.40 MPa and the average spring rate is 0.08 N/m. Electrical properties were characterized with nanomanipulator, which showed that the ZnO nanomaterial have cut-off characteristics and good schottky contact with the tungsten probes. A two-probe strategy was proposed for piezoelectric property measurement, which is easy to operate and adaptable to multiple nanomaterials.

In order to detect these frequency bands of strong wave attenuation experimentally, several devices for wave excitation and measurement can be applied. In this work, piezoelectric transducers are utilized to excite two additively manufactured three-dimensional cellular structures. For the measurement of the transmission factor, we compare two methods. First, the transmitted waves are measured with the same kind of piezoelectric transducer. Second, a laser Doppler vibrometer is employed to scan the mechanical vibrations of the sample on both the emitting and receiving surfaces. The additional comparison of two different methods of spatial averaging of the vibrometer data, that is, the quadratic mean and arithmetic mean, provides insight into the way the piezoelectric transducers convert the transmitted signal.

{"title": "A Pot-Like Vibrational Microfluidic Rotational Motor.", "abstract": "Constructing a micro-sized microfluidic motor always involves the problem of how to transfer the mechanical energy out of the motor. The paper presents several experiments with pot-like microfluidic rotational motor structures driven by two perpendicular sine and cosine vibrations with amplitudes around 10 \u03bcm in the frequency region from 200 Hz to 500 Hz. The extensive theoretical research based on the mathematical model of the liquid streaming in a pot-like structure was the base for the successful real-life laboratory application of a microfluidic rotational motor. The final microfluidic motor structure allowed transferring the rotational mechanical energy out of the motor with a central axis. The main practical challenge of the research was to find the proper balance between the torque, due to friction in the bearings and the motor's maximal torque. The presented motor, with sizes 1 mm by 0.6 mm, reached the maximal rotational speed in both directions between -15 rad/s to +14 rad/s, with the estimated maximal torque of 0.1 pNm. The measured frequency characteristics of vibration amplitudes and phase angle between the directions of both vibrational amplitudes and rotational speed of the motor rotor against frequency of vibrations, allowed us to understand how to build the pot-like microfluidic rotational motor.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-03-07", "authors": ["SuzanaUran", "Matja\u017eMalok", "Bo\u017eidarBratina", "Riko\u0160afari\u010d"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12020177\n10.1109/SENSOR.1991.149072\n10.1039/c001211d\n10.1007/s10404-008-0349-6\n10.1063/1.3600775\n10.1117/12.903220\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141418\n10.1039/C6LC00443A\n10.3390/mi9110596\n10.1007/s42452-020-2495-8\n10.1080/15567260601009221\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/12/010\n10.3390/mi5030681\n10.1038/micronano.2015.1\n10.1039/C8LC01012A\n10.1038/s41598-017-07025-x\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.11.044064\n10.3390/mi10120809\n10.1002/smll.201903605\n10.3390/fluids3040093\n10.1121/1.1907285"}
{"title": "A Multi-Mode Broadband Vibration Energy Harvester Composed of Symmetrically Distributed U-Shaped Cantilever Beams.", "abstract": "Using the piezoelectric effect to harvest energy from surrounding vibrations is a promising alternative solution for powering small electronic devices such as wireless sensors and portable devices. A conventional piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) can only efficiently collect energy within a small range around the resonance frequency. To realize broadband vibration energy harvesting, the idea of multiple-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) PEH to realize multiple resonant frequencies within a certain range has been recently proposed and some preliminary research has validated its feasibility. Therefore, this paper proposed a multi-DOF wideband PEH based on the frequency interval shortening mechanism to realize five resonance frequencies close enough to each other. The PEH consists of five tip masses, two U-shaped cantilever beams and a straight beam, and tuning of the resonance frequencies is realized by specific parameter design. The electrical characteristics of the PEH are analyzed by simulation and experiment, validating that the PEH can effectively expand the operating bandwidth and collect vibration energy in the low frequency. Experimental results show that the PEH has five low-frequency resonant frequencies, which are 13, 15, 18, 21 and 24 Hz; under the action of 0.5 g acceleration, the maximum output power is 52.2, 49.4, 61.3, 39.2 and 32.1 \u03bcW, respectively. In view of the difference between the simulation and the experimental results, this paper conducted an error analysis and revealed that the material parameters and parasitic capacitance are important factors that affect the simulation results. Based on the analysis, the simulation is improved for better agreement with experiments.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-03-07", "authors": ["XiaohuaHuang", "ChengZhang", "KerenDai"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12020203\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113871\n10.1002/admt.201900177\n10.1007/s40684-019-00132-2\n10.1063/1.4927466\n10.1002/advs.202000254\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919986\n10.1155/2014/815467\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.122\n10.1007/s40684-019-00048-x\n10.1002/admt.201900741\n10.1109/TMECH.2015.2459014\n10.3390/s20010077\n10.1063/1.5053945\n10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.053\n10.1063/1.5083910\n10.1007/s00542-017-3408-7\n10.1021/acsnano.8b08274\n10.1021/acsnano.8b04654\n10.1007/s40684-019-00149-7\n10.1002/adfm.201705808\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.10.005\n10.1155/2018/5037187\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1734\n10.1007/s00542-018-3846-x\n10.1007/s00542-019-04321-6\n10.1007/s00542-019-04597-8\n10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103173\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.12.032\n10.1063/1.3629551\n10.1063/1.3159815\n10.1143/JJAP.51.040211\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.05.029\n10.1007/s11664-014-3398-5\n10.1023/A:1012452613720\n10.1007/s12274-016-1275-7\n10.3390/s121216673"}

{"title": "Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Biological Microdissection Device Based on a Novel Flexure Mechanism for Suppressing Vibration.", "abstract": "Biological microdissection has a wide range of applications in the field of molecular pathology. The current laser-assisted dissection technology is expensive. As an economical microdissection method, piezoelectric ultrasonic microdissection has broad application prospects. However, the performance of the current piezoelectric ultrasonic microdissection technology is unsatisfactory. This paper aims to solve the problems of the low dissecting precision and excessive wear of the dissecting needle caused by the harmful lateral vibration of the present piezoelectric ultrasonic microdissection device. A piezoelectric ultrasonic microdissection device based on a novel flexure mechanism is proposed. By analyzing the flexure hinge flexibility, the type of flexure beam and the optimal design parameters are determined. Through harmonic response simulation analysis, the newly designed microdissection device with a vibration-suppressing mechanism achieves the best vibration effect when the driving frequency is 28 kHz. Under this driving frequency, the lateral vibration suppression effect is improved by 68% compared to the traditional effect without vibration suppression. Then, based on 3D printing technology, a prototype of a novel microdissection device is produced, and its performance is tested. Experiments on dissecting needle vibration tests show that the flexure mechanism does indeed suppress the lateral vibration of the needle tip. We conducted various tissue dissection experiments on paraffin tissue sections. First, we determine the optimal dissecting parameters (driving voltage, frequency, feed speed, cutting angle) of the new equipment through various parameter dissecting experiments. Then, we adopt these optimal dissecting parameters to perform three kinds of dissecting experiments on mouse tissue paraffin section (liver, lung, bone), dissecting experiments on tissue sections of different thicknesses (3 \u03bcm, 4 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm), sampling and extraction experiments on complete tissue. The new device has a better dissecting performance for paraffin tissue sections below a 5 \u03bcm thickness and can complete various dissecting tasks. Finally, we compare the wear of the dissecting needles of the new and old devices after the same dissecting tasks. The results prove that the suppression of harmful lateral vibration not only significantly improves the dissecting effect but also increases the service life and durability of the dissecting needle, which is beneficial for reducing the equipment costs.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-03-07", "authors": ["HaiboHuang", "YifanPan", "YanPang", "HaoShen", "XiweiGao", "YichenZhu", "LiguoChen", "LiningSun"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12020196\n10.1038/s41598-020-63495-6\n10.3390/mi4020272\n10.1038/ng.3398\n10.1002/cncy.21550\n10.1186/s12864-016-2437-4\n10.1111/j.1600-0560.2012.01921.x\n10.1002/pmic.201600004\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00284\n10.1126/science.274.5289.998\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.239-242.1343\n10.1007/s10544-014-9859-z\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64669-X\n10.1186/1471-2407-9-4\n10.1007/978-1-62703-269-8_3\n10.1016/S0003-9969(03)00152-3\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.06.010\n10.1109/TASE.2016.2575845\n10.1016/j.measurement.2020.107685\n10.1088/1361-6439/ab9007\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2713302"}
{"title": "Thermodynamic Modeling and Validation of the Temperature Influence in Ternary Phase Polymer Systems.", "abstract": "The effect of the temperature, as a process variable in the fabrication of polymeric membranes by the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique, has been scarcely studied. In the present work, we studied the influence of temperature, working at 293, 313 and 333 K, on the experimental binodal curves of four ternary systems composed of PVDF and PES as the polymers, DMAc and NMP as the solvents and water as the non-solvent. The increase of the temperature caused an increase on the solubility gap of the ternary system, as expected. The shift of the binodal curve with the temperature was more evident in PVDF systems than in PES systems indicating the influence of the rubbery or glassy state of the polymer on the thermodynamics of phase separation. As a novelty, the present work has introduced the temperature influence on the Flory-Huggins model to fit the experimental cloud points.

Herein is presented a bidirectional scanning method designed for STXM with an S-shaped moving track. In this method, artificially designed ramp waves are generated by a piezo-stage controller to control the two-dimensional scanning of the sample. The sample position information is measured using laser interferometric sensors and sent to a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board which also acquires the X-ray signals simultaneously from the detector. Since the data recorded by the FPGA contain the real position of each scanned point, the influence of the backlash caused by the back-turning movement on the STXM image can be eliminated. By employing an adapted post-processing program, a re-meshed high-resolution STXM image can be obtained.

Piezo channels may play a role in this exaggeration, as blocking these channels attenuates the exaggerated pressor response to tendon stretch in T1DM rats. However, tendon stretch constitutes a different mechanical and physiological stimuli than that occurring during muscle contraction. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of Piezo channels in evoking the pressor reflex during an intermittent muscle contraction in T1DM. In unanesthetized decerebrate rats, we compared the pressor and cardioaccelerator responses to intermittent muscle contraction before and after locally injecting grammostola spatulata mechanotoxin 4 (GsMTx-4, 0.25\u2009\u00b5M) into the hindlimb vasculature. Although GsMTx-4 has a high potency for Piezo channels, it has also been suggested to block transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) channels. We, therefore, performed additional experiments to control for this possibility by also injecting SKF 96365 (10\u2009\u00b5M), a TRPC channel blocker.

To optimally attenuate structures vibrating at high-frequency range, i.e. non-deterministic substructure (Non-DS) using a PZT shunt damper, it is found that the impedance of the PZT patch's terminal needs to be the complex conjugate of its inherent capacitance paralleled with the impedance 'faced' by its non-deterministic host structure underline moment actuation. The latter was derived in terms of estimation of the effective line moment mobility of a PZT patch on a Non-DS plate by integrating the expression of driving point moment mobility of an infinite thin plate. This paper conducts a parametric investigation to study the effect of changing the size, quantity and configuration of the PZT patch to the performance of the optimal PZT shunt dampers in dissipating the energy of its non-deterministic host structure.

However, far too little attention has been paid to the companion percolation, another key element to affect the output. Here, the TENG with MXene-embedded polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite film is fabricated, and the dependence of the output capability on the MXene loading is investigated experimentally and theoretically. Specifically, the surface charge density mainly depends on the dielectric permittivity at lower MXene loadings, and in contrast, the percolation becomes the degrading factor with the further increase of the conductive loadings. At the balance between the dielectric and percolation properties, the surface charge density of the MXene-modified TENG obtained 350% enhancement compared to that with the pure PVDF.

Four key design factors: mass placement, triboelectric surface area, extension length and magnetic stiffness were investigated and optimised. The voltage generation from piezoelectric and triboelectric mechanisms was determined individually to understand the effect of each design factor on the mechanisms. An output power of 659\u00a0\u00b5W at 180 k\u03a9 at 44\u00a0Hz was obtained from the optimised MT-HPTEH with a theoretical-experimental discrepancy of less than 10%.

{"title": "Understanding Loss of Soluble High Molecular Weight Species during Filtration of Low Concentration Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies.", "abstract": "Sterile filtration is an integral step in the manufacturing process of biological therapeutics. Protein adsorption to the surface of the filter is an unfortunate, common occurrence that can result in manufacturing difficulties, such as filter fouling or product loss. Although many filters have surface modifications to minimize adsorption, under certain conditions binding can still occur. We observed the loss of high molecular weight species (HMWS) during sterile filtration of eight different therapeutic monoclonal antibodies formulated at low protein concentrations across a commonly used hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter membrane. The protein absorption was specific to HMWS, and each antibody exhibited different degrees of filter adsorption. Debye screening length parameters of the solution (e.g. ionic strength) were adjusted, and influenced the amount of HMWS lost during filtration. Additionally, HMWS of a representative antibody (mAb1) were observed to be more positively charged than other size variants by ion-exchange chromatography. From these results, it is concluded that this HMWS loss is due to electrostatic interactions between HMWS and the filter surface. This adsorption can be reduced by increasing the ionic strength of the buffer matrix, demonstrating the influence of the Debye screening length in the filtration of low concentration proteins.", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "date": "2021-02-22", "authors": ["Arthur JSchick", "LiYi", "PhilippeLam", "PrestonPallante", "NathanielSwanson", "Jacqueline YTyler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.xphs.2021.02.015"}

The dissolved gas concentration was adjusted by controlling the over-head gas pressure.

Simulation of these strain changes could contribute to better understanding of the early formative stages of HF. This is especially important in investigating the poorly understood pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Here, we discuss delivery of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in a murine model to alter left ventricular (LV) regional longitudinal strain (RLS), and use of speckle tracking echocardiography to detect these changes.\nHIFU pulses (pressure amplitude 1.7 MPa) were generated by amplifying a sinusoidal waveform from a function generator into a piezoelectric transducer. These pulses were then directed extracorporeally towards the anterior LV surface of C57BI6 mice during three time periods (early, mid, and late diastole). Speckle tracking echocardiography was then used to quantify changes in RLS within six segments of the LV.\nWe observed an increase in LV RLS with acoustic augmentation during all three time periods. This augmentation was most prominent near the anterior apical region in early diastole and near the posterior basilar region during late diastole.\nOur findings demonstrate the application of HIFU to non-invasively induce changes in RLS within a murine model. Our results also reflect the capability of speckle tracking echocardiography to analyze and quantify these changes.

{"title": "Comb-like structural modification stabilizes polyvinylidene fluoride membranes to realize thermal-regulated sustainable transportation efficiency.", "abstract": "Hydrophobic micro-porous membrane such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with excellent thermal-/chemical-stability and low surface energy has received extensive attention in industrial water treatment and sustainable energy conversion. However, undesirable contaminants caused by inevitable proteins or microorganisms adhesion may lead to a rapid loss of separation efficiency, which significantly deteriorate their porous structures and eventually limit their practical performance. Herein, we present a scalable approach for fabricating comb-like copolymer modified PVDF membranes (PVDF-PN@AgNPs) that prevent bacteria from proliferating on the surface and temperature-controlled release of adhered contaminants. Comb-like structured copolymers were imparted to a polydopamine (PDA)-treated PVDF membrane by Michael addition reaction, which enabled a covalent binding of comb-like structured copolymers to the membrane. Such unique structural design of grafted copolymer, containing hydrophilic side chain and temperature-responsive chain backbone, stably prevents bacteria adhesion and provides reversible surface wettability. Therefore, the resultant membranes were evaluated to prevent bacterial adhesion, high touch-killing efficiency and temperature-controlled contaminants release (~99% of protein and ~75% of bacteria). Moreover, with the collapse and stretch of grafted copolymer chain backbone, the synthetic membrane further reversibly adjusted inner micro-porous structure and surface wettability, which eventually helped to achieve variable water fluid transport efficiency. This study not only provides a feasible structural design for stably coping with the challenging of antifouling and subsequent contamination adhesion of PVDF membrane, but also potentially answers the significant gap between lab research advances and practical application, particularly in the industrial membrane field.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2021-02-18", "authors": ["JingfengYuan", "DongZhang", "YanhongFu", "YifengNi", "YitingWang", "IrynaProtsak", "YutingYang", "YipengPeng", "JunTan", "JintaoYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.091"}

{"title": "A PZT-PVDF Stacked Transducer for Short-Pulse Ultrasound Therapy and Monitoring.", "abstract": "Therapeutic ultrasound technologies using microbubbles require a feedback control system to perform the treatment in a safe and effective manner. Current feedback control technologies utilize the microbubble's acoustic emissions to adjust the treatment acoustic parameters. Typical systems use two separated transducers: one for transmission and the other for reception. However, separating the transmitter and receiver leads to foci misalignment. This limitation could be resolved by arranging the transmitter and receiver in a stacked configuration. Taking advantage of an increasing number of short-pulse-based therapeutic methods, we have constructed a lead zirconate titanate-polyvinylidene fluoride (PZT-PVDF) stacked transducer design that allows the transmission and reception of short-pulse ultrasound from the same location. Our design had a piston transmitter composed of a PZT disk (1 MHz, 12.7 mm in diameter), a backing layer, and two matching layers. A layer of PVDF ( [Formula: see text] in thickness, 12.7 mm in diameter) was placed at the front surface of the transmitter for reception. Transmission and reception from the same location were demonstrated in pulse-echo experiments where PZT transmitted a pulse and both PZT and PVDF received the echo. The echo signal received by the PVDF was [Formula: see text] shorter than the signal received by the PZT. Reception of broadband acoustic emissions using the PVDF was also demonstrated in experiments where microbubbles were exposed to ultrasound pulses. Thus, we have shown that our PZT-PVDF stack design has unique transmission and reception features that could be incorporated into a multielement array design that improves focal superimposing, transmission efficiency, and reception sensitivity.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-02-17", "authors": ["ZhengJiang", "Robert JDickinson", "Timothy LHall", "James JChoi"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3059715"}
{"title": "Optimization Design of Ultrasonic Transducer With Multimatching Layer.", "abstract": "An optimization design strategy is developed for ultrasonic transducer (UT) with multimatching layer to improve its performance. The piezoelectric equivalent circuit model is used to determine the optimization interval of matching layer, and the PiezoCAD software is used to simulate the performance of UT with multimatching layer. The neural network (NN) models are trained by the simulation data to characterize the relationship between the thickness of matching layer and performance of UT. Then, the multiobjective optimality criteria for UT is established based on its performance parameters, including center frequency (CF), -6 dB bandwidth (BW) and pulsewidth (PW). The thickness of matching layer is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. According to the designed performance, the optimized copper thickness and parylene thickness are about 17.76 and [Formula: see text], respectively. The simulation results of UT with the optimized multimatching layer well agree with the designed targets. Also, CF, -6 dB BW, and PW of the fabricated UT with the optimized multimatching layer are 5.672 MHz, 50.08%, and [Formula: see text], respectively, which nearly achieve the designed performance. In addition, the performance of UT with the optimized multimatching layer is much better than that of UT without matching layer. Moreover, compared with UT with single or double matching layers determined by the quarter wavelength theory, the UT with the optimized multimatching layer has better comprehensive performance. Finally, the fabricated UT with the optimized multimatching layer is used to measure the thickness of testing block, and the relative errors are all less than 1.0%, which implies that the optimized UT has excellent performance.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-02-17", "authors": ["ZhaoxiLi", "DongdongChen", "ChunlongFei", "DiLi", "WeiFeng", "YintangYang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3059671"}

Herein, we present direct-written piezoelectric poly(vinylidene difluoride) fibers that are orthogonally assembled into nanofibrous grids (NFGs) as self-powered tactile sensors. Five nanofibrous strips (NFSs) are written on a polyurethane film via a uniform-field electrospinning (UFES) process, and two polyurethane films are orthogonally assembled into 5 \u00d7 5 NFGs with 25 pixels. Benefited from the mechanical flexibility and helical architecture of UFES fibers, stable piezoelectric outputs have been detected according to different locations or different pressures on an NFS, and a sensitivity of 7.1 mV/kPa is detected from the slope of voltage-pressure curves. In the orthogonally assembled NFGs, the pressure on a pixel of an NFS causes corresponding deformations of neighboring NFSs. The piezoelectric outputs vary with the distance from the pressing point, enabling us to position the pressing points and track the pressing trajectory in real time. Through judging piezoelectric outputs of all NFSs, precise locations of any pressed pixel with a resolution of 1 mm are presented vividly via luminous light-emitting diodes (LED), and the mapping profiles are displayed by pressing metal letters (S, W, J, T, and U) on multiple pixels. Furthermore, the coordinates of pressure either on an NFS or between NFSs with a resolution of 0.5 mm are reported digitally on a liquid crystal display (LCD). Thus, we developed novel self-powered tactile sensors with orthogonal NFGs to achieve real-time motion tracking, accurate spatial sensing, and location identification with high resolutions, which provide potential applications in electronic skin, robotics, and interface of artificial intelligence.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2021-02-17", "authors": ["QingjieLiu", "LongJin", "PengZhang", "BinbinZhang", "YingxinLi", "ShuangXie", "XiaohongLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c22318"}

We also manipulated incubation and reaction conditions and assessed the subsequent effects on activity and stability of \u03b2-galactosidase, with comparisons between various solid support materials and free (dissolved) enzyme. Nylon-6 fiber membranes were created by electrospinning and were compared with other materials as solid supports for enzyme binding. The other materials included polyvinylidene fluoride 5-kDa nanofiltration dairy membranes, nylon-6 pellets, and silica glass beads. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the large surface area of NFM, which correlated with greater enzyme activity compared with the relatively flatter surfaces of the other solid support materials. Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically with the color-changing substrate o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside. Compared with the other solid supports, NFM had greater maximum enzyme binding potential. Across pH conditions ranging from 3.5 to 6.0 (including the optimal pH of 4.0-5.0), enzyme activity was maintained on the membrane-immobilized samples, whereas free enzyme did not maintain activity. Altering the storage temperature (4, 22, and 50\u00b0C) affected enzyme stability (i.e., the ability of the enzyme to maintain activity over time) of free and polyvinylidene fluoride membrane samples. However, NFM samples maintained stability across the varying storage temperatures. Increasing the immobilization solution enzyme concentration above the maximum enzyme binding capacity had no significant effect on enzyme stability for membrane-immobilized samples; however, both had lower mean stability than free enzyme by approximately 74%. With further development, \u03b2-galactosidase immobilized on NFM or other membranes could be used in continuous processing in the dairy industry for a combination of filtration and lactose hydrolysis-creating products that are reduced in lactose and increased in sweetness, with no requirement for \"added sugars\" on the nutrition label and no enzyme listed as final product ingredient.", "journal": "Journal of dairy science", "date": "2021-02-17", "authors": ["D AHutchins", "JNoh", "J DKenealey"], "doi": "10.3168/jds.2020-19453"}

Several researches have been reported by mimicking the basilar membrane but still have dimensional drawback due to limitation of controlling a multifrequency band and broadening resonant spectrum for full-cover phonetic frequencies. Here, highly sensitive piezoelectric mobile acoustic sensor (PMAS) is demonstrated by exploiting an ultrathin membrane for biomimetic frequency band control. Simulation results prove that resonant bandwidth of a piezoelectric film can be broadened by adopting a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) membrane on the ultrathin polymer to cover the entire voice spectrum. Machine learning-based biometric authentication is demonstrated by the integrated acoustic sensor module with an algorithm processor and customized Android app. Last, exceptional error rate reduction in speaker identification is achieved by a PMAS module with a small amount of training data, compared to a conventional microelectromechanical system microphone.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2021-02-14", "authors": ["Hee SeungWang", "Seong KwangHong", "Jae HyunHan", "Young HoonJung", "Hyun KyuJeong", "Tae HongIm", "Chang KyuJeong", "Bo-YeonLee", "GwangsuKim", "Chang DYoo", "Keon JaeLee"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.abe5683"}
{"title": "Review on Recent Developments in 2D Ferroelectrics: Theories and Applications.", "abstract": "Although only a few 2D materials have been predicted to possess ferroelectricity, 2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. The ferroelectric properties of 2D ferroelectrics are significantly different than those of traditional bulk ferroelectrics owing to their intrinsic size and surface effects. To date, 2D\u00a0ferroelectrics have been reported to exhibit diverse properties ranging from bulk photovoltaic and piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects to the spontaneous valley and spin polarization. These properties are either dependent on ferroelectric polarization or coupled with it for easy electric control, thus making 2D ferroelectrics applicable to multifunctional nanodevices. At present, cumulative efforts are being made to explore 2D ferroelectrics in theories, experiments, and applications. Herein, such theories and methods are briefly introduced. Subsequently, intrinsic and extrinsic origins of 2D\u00a0ferroelectricity are separately summarized. In addition, invented or laboratory-validated 2D ferroelectric-based applications are listed. Finally, the existing challenges and prospects of 2D ferroelectrics are discussed.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["LuQi", "ShuangchenRuan", "Yu-JiaZeng"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202005098"}
{"title": "Magnetoelectric effect in flexible nanocomposite films based on size-matching.", "abstract": "Flexible magnetoelectric (ME) nanocomposites with a strong coupling between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity are of significant importance from the point of view of next-generation flexible electronic devices. However, a high loading of magnetic nanomaterials is needed to achieve preferable ME response due to the size mismatch of the magnetostrictive phase and piezoelectric phase. In this work, ultra-small CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were prepared to match the size of the polar crystal in poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (POTS) is introduced to enhance the interplay between P(VDF-TrFE) and CoFe2O4. The above multiple effects promote a good connection between the magnetostrictive phase and the piezoelectric phase. Therefore, an effective transference of stress from CoFe2O4 to P(VDF-TrFE) can be achieved. The as-prepared P(VDF-TrFE)/CoFe2O4@POTS exhibits a high ME coupling coefficient of 34 mV cm-1 Oe-1 when the content of CoFe2O4@POTS is 20 wt%.

{"title": "Temperature Characteristics of a Contour Mode MEMS AlN Piezoelectric Ring Resonator on SOI Substrate.", "abstract": "As a result of their IC compatibility, high acoustic velocity, and high thermal conductivity, aluminum nitride (AlN) resonators have been studied extensively over the past two decades, and widely implemented for radio frequency (RF) and sensing applications. However, the temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of AlN is -25 ppm/\u00b0C, which is high and limits its RF and sensing application. In contrast, the TCF of heavily doped silicon is significantly lower than the TCF of AlN. As a result, this study uses an AlN contour mode ring type resonator with heavily doped silicon as its bottom electrode in order to reduce the TCF of an AlN resonator. A simple microfabrication process based on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) is presented. A thickness ratio of 20:1 was chosen for the silicon bottom electrode to the AlN layer in order to make the TCF of the resonator mainly dependent upon heavily doped silicon. A cryogenic cooling test down to 77 K and heating test up to 400 K showed that the resonant frequency of the AlN resonator changed linearly with temperature change; the TCF was shown to be -9.1 ppm/\u00b0C. The temperature hysteresis characteristic of the resonator was also measured, and the AlN resonator showed excellent temperature stability. The quality factor versus temperature characteristic was also studied between 77 K and 400 K. It was found that lower temperature resulted in a higher quality factor, and the quality factor increased by 56.43%, from 1291.4 at 300 K to 2020.2 at 77 K.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["SitaoFei", "HaoRen"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12020143\n10.1109/5.704269\n10.1109/JMEMS.2004.839347\n10.1016/j.elstat.2010.01.005\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/4/045019\n10.1016/j.bios.2019.111354\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.05.037\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.01.056\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2748041\n10.1002/admt.201700279\n10.1143/JJAP.49.07HD09\n10.3390/mi11070630\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/9/095002\n10.1063/1.1396633\n10.3390/mi7120231\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2867813\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.889503\n10.1063/1.124055\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/3/030\n10.1109/JSEN.2003.815780\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/3/035018\n10.1109/TED.2011.2172613\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.2972779\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2347205\n10.1007/s11664-018-6695-6\n10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2179011\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.886012\n10.1007/s10854-019-02480-w\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.05.096\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.554\n10.1016/j.mee.2012.10.004\n10.1109/JMEMS.2008.924253\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2030074"}
{"title": "Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane Via Vapour Induced Phase Separation for Oil/Water Emulsion Filtration.", "abstract": "Membrane-based technology is an attractive option for the treatment of oily wastewater because of its high oil removal efficiency, small footprint and operational simplicity. However, filtration performance is highly restricted by membrane fouling, especially when treating oil/water emulsion as a result of strong interaction between oil droplets and the hydrophobic property of the membrane. This study explores the fabrication of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based membrane via the vapour induced phase separation (VIPS) method while incorporating polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a hydrophilic additive to encounter membrane fouling issues and improve membrane filterability. The resulting membranes were characterized and tested for oil/water emulsion filtration to evaluate their hydraulic, rejection and anti-fouling properties. Results show that the changes in membrane morphology and structure from typical macrovoids with finger-like substructure to cellular structure and larger membrane pore size were observed by the prolonged exposure time from 0 to 30 min through the VIPS method. The enhanced clean water permeability is attributed to the addition of PVP-LiCl in the dope solution that enlarges the mean flow pore size from 0.210 \u00b1 0.1 to 7.709 \u00b1 3.5 \u00b5m.

The tests were carried out using non-destructive testing (NDT). The authors made an attempt to determine the validity of the use and degree of effectiveness of the tests based on laser vibrometry in detecting defects in welded joints. The tests of welded plates were carried out using displacement laser sensors and piezoelectric accelerometers, while the source of vibration extortion was a modal hammer. In the adopted measurement methodology, the application of accelerometers was to obtain the reference data, which allowed for comparison with the measurement data obtained from the laser vibrometer. The analysis of the obtained measurement data, in the fields of time and frequency, made it possible to verify the correctness of the data obtained by means of laser vibrometry and to determine the requirements which are necessary for the correct performance of NDT tests and in the future structural health monitoring (SHM) system of welded joints with the use of a laser vibrometer. The mathematical model developed in the MSC software Pastran-Nastran was also used in the work. The model was developed for the purpose of mutual verification of the measurement and calculation tests. At the present stage of work, it can be stated that the results obtained by laser vibrometry methods should be treated as a supplement to the research conducted with traditional piezoelectric accelerometers.

{"title": "Design Study of a Round Window Piezoelectric Transducer for Active Middle Ear Implants.", "abstract": "This report describes the design of a new piezoelectric transducer for round window (RW)-driven middle ear implants. The transducer consists of a piezoelectric element, gold-coated copper bellows, silicone elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS), metal cylinder (tungsten), and titanium housing. The piezoelectric element is fixed to the titanium housing and mechanical resonance is generated by the interaction of the bellows, PDMS, and tungsten cylinder. The dimensions of PDMS and the tungsten cylinder with output characteristics suitable for compensation of sensorineural hearing loss were derived by mechanical vibrational analysis (equivalent mechanical model and finite element analysis (FEA)). Based on the results of FEA, the RW piezoelectric transducer was implemented, and bench tests were performed under no-load conditions to confirm the output characteristics.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Ring Bender for Characterization of Shear Waves in Compacted Sandy Soils.", "abstract": "Shear wave velocity and small-strain shear modulus are widely used as the mechanical properties of soil. The objective of this study is to develop a new shear wave monitoring system using a pair of piezoelectric ring benders (RBs) and to evaluate the suitability of RB in compacted soils compared with the bender element and ultrasonic transducer. The RB is a multilayered piezoelectric actuator, which can generate shear waves without disturbing soils. For five compacted soil specimens, the shear waves are monitored by using three different piezoelectric transducers. Results of time-domain response show that the output signals measured from the RB vary according to the water content of the specimen and the frequency of the input signal. Except at the water content of 9.3%, the difference in the resonant frequencies between the three transducers is not significant. The shear wave velocities for the RB are slightly greater than those for the other transducers. For the RB, the exponential relationship between the shear wave velocity and dry unit weight is better established compared with that of the other transducers. The newly proposed piezoelectric transducer RB may be useful for the evaluation of the shear wave velocity and small-strain shear modulus of compacted soils.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["Dong-JuKim", "Jung-DoungYu", "Yong-HoonByun"], "doi": "10.3390/s21041226\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1994)120:12(2208)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1991)117:1(89)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1992)118:5(830.2)\n10.1007/BF02486787\n10.1139/cgj-2014-0524\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2005)131:9(1063)\n10.1139/T08-069\n10.1016/j.sandf.2015.09.002\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001645\n10.1520/GTJ20120125\n10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000917\n10.1139/cgj-2014-0306\n10.1139/t94-007\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2016.01.019\n10.1007/s13762-017-1465-1\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(1998)124:6(523)\n10.1016/0267-7261(92)90036-D\n10.2113/JEEG10.2.77\n10.1121/1.381760\n10.3390/s20216291\n10.2136/vzj2009.0131\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.09.113\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2010)136:1(199)\n10.3141/2656-04\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.072\n10.1016/j.geotexmem.2018.12.015\n10.1016/j.geotexmem.2019.01.005\n10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0001147\n10.1016/j.sandf.2015.02.009\n10.1680/geot.2005.55.5.403\n10.1520/GTJ103300\n10.1080/10298436.2020.1743291\n10.3390/s20216054\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120192\n10.1177/0361198196154800112\n10.1139/cgj-2016-0015"}

The motivation of this work was to compare both the SW- and the TW-based motion of a 20-mm long sub-gram glass plate, with attached 3D printed legs, and piezoelectric patches for the actuation. The fabrication of the robot did not require sophisticated techniques and the speed of motion was measured under different loading conditions. In the case of the TW mechanism, the influence of using different pairs of modes to generate the TW on the locomotion speed has been studied, as well as the effect of the coupling of the TW motion and the first flexural vibration mode of the legs. This analysis resulted in a maximum unloaded speed of 6 bodylengths/s (BL/s) at 65 V peak-to-peak (Vpp). The SW approach also examined different modes of vibration and a speed of locomotion as high as 14 BL/s was achieved, requiring, unlike the TW case, a highly precise location of the legs on the glass supporting platform and a precise tuning of the excitation frequency.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2021-02-13", "authors": ["JorgeHernando-Garc\u00eda", "Jose LuisGarc\u00eda-Caraballo", "V\u00edctorRuiz-D\u00edez", "Jose LuisS\u00e1nchez-Rojas"], "doi": "10.3390/mi12020171\n10.1177/0278364906069150\n10.1109/LRA.2020.3003870\n10.1146/annurev-control-053018-023814\n10.1177/0278364914521473\n10.1109/LRA.2018.2793355\n10.1163/016918611X568602\n10.3390/robotics3030235\n10.1109/LRA.2016.2523603\n10.1121/1.392037\n10.1016/S0041-624X(99)00087-6\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025013\n10.1177/1045389X16679284\n10.3390/mi11030321\n10.1088/0964-1726/6/5/014\n10.1063/1.4790278\n10.1109/58.726435\n10.1177/1077546306070619\n10.1109/TRO.2017.2656902\n10.3390/mi11050517\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/7/074003\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.01.019"}

Monitoring and controlling these stimuli on in vitro experiments is not straightforward due to the coupling of these different stimuli. In addition, active and reciprocal cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions are essential to be considered during formation of complex tissue such as myocardial tissue. In this sense, computational models can offer new perspectives and key information on the cell microenvironment. Thus, we present a new computational 3D model, based on the Finite Element Method, where a complex extracellular matrix with piezoelectric properties interacts with cardiac muscle cells during the first steps of tissue formation. This model includes collective behavior and cell processes such as cell migration, maturation, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The model has employed to study the initial stages of in vitro cardiac aggregate formation, considering cell-cell junctions, under different extracellular matrix configurations. Three different cases have been purposed to evaluate cell behavior in fibered, mechanically stimulated fibered, and mechanically stimulated piezoelectric fibered extra-cellular matrix. In this last case, the cells are guided by the coupling of mechanical and electrical stimuli.

{"title": "Nonlinear electromechanical modeling and robustness of soft robotic fish-like energy harvester: insights and possible issues.", "abstract": "This work investigates the possible integration of an energy harvester in a bioinspired fish-like aquatic unmanned vehicle. The defined fish-like system utilizes a reduced complexity prescribed motion as the representation for energy harvester to be subjected to. Nonlinear electromechanical modeling is performed by considering the geometric and piezoelectric nonlinearities. A convergence analysis is carried out in order to determine the required modes in the Galerkin discretization due to the presence of nonlinear interactions between the prescribed and relative motions. The utilization of higher-order modeling for the strain and material leads to the identification of impactful prescribed motions terms that can activate the nonlinearities in the system, results in more harmonics to consider, and leads to the presence parametric excitation terms. Considering a reduced-complex model by decreasing the value of the quadratic constraint envelope that the fish-like system would be forced with, the soft-robotic system behaves more with a base excitation characteristic. Small damping would allow this prescribed motion with reduced quadratic envelope forcing still induces a hardening behavior, but the other harmonics and parametric resonance seen are greatly reduced. Considering this reduced complexity system, the interaction between the prescribed and base excitations is also investigated to demonstrate that when the two excitations are of similar nature constructive and destructive build of the response waveform can occur when looking at near the first natural resonance. It is shown that the quenching phenomenon can take place which may result in a destructive response of the piezoelectric energy harvester. The results show that the robustness of the fish-like robot is directly dependent on the design parameters including the damping of the structure, importance of the undulatory motion, and activation of the resonances.", "journal": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "date": "2021-02-12", "authors": ["RSalazar", "AAbdelkefi"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-3190/abe54c"}

A sufficient set of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) propagation velocities have been measured in cube-shaped samples to obtain the full set of second-order elastic and piezoelectric material constants along with the experimental uncertainties. The cross correlation method was used to accurately measure the time-of-flight (TOF) values between the first two back-wall echoes under a constant room-temperature environment. The calculated BAW velocities and extracted material constants show good agreement with earlier work.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2021-02-11", "authors": ["ShuaiJu", "ChenZhang", "ParhamZahedinejad", "HaifengZhang", "John AKosinski"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2021.3058326"}
{"title": "Practical microcircuits for handheld acoustofluidics.", "abstract": "Acoustofluidics has promised to enable lab-on-a-chip and point-of-care devices in ways difficult to achieve using other methods. Piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers-as small as the chips they actuate-provide rapid fluid and suspended object transport. Acoustofluidic lab-on-chip devices offer a vast range of benefits in early disease identification and noninvasive drug delivery. However, their potential has long been undermined by the need for benchtop or rack-mount electronics. The piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers within require these equipment and thus acoustofluidic device implementation in a bedside setting has been limited. Here we detail a general process to enable the reader to produce battery or mains-powered microcircuits ideal for driving 1-300 MHz acoustic devices. We include the general design strategy for the circuit, the blocks that collectively define it, and suitable, specific choices for components to produce these blocks. We furthermore illustrate how to incorporate automated resonance finding and tracking, sensing and feedback, and built-in adjustability to accommodate devices' vastly different operating frequencies and powers in a single driver, including examples of fluid and particle manipulation typical of the needs in our discipline. With this in hand, the many groups active in lab-on-a-chip acoustofluidics can now finally deliver on the promise of handheld, point-of-care technologies.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2021-02-11", "authors": ["AnHuang", "WilliamConnacher", "MarkStambaugh", "NaiqingZhang", "ShuaiZhang", "JiyangMei", "AditiJain", "SravyaAlluri", "VincentLeung", "Anushi ERajapaksa", "JamesFriend"], "doi": "10.1039/d0lc01008a"}
{"title": "A decellularized oocyte-derived scaffold provides a \"sperm safe\" to preserve mammalian spermatozoa.", "abstract": "Although only one spermatozoon is needed to create a zygote, a significant challenge is the storage and recovery of germ cells when sperm counts are extremely low.\nWe engineered an oocyte-derived biomaterial-the zona pellucida (ZP)-as a \"sperm safe\" for storing spermatozoon. The ZP is a glycoprotein matrix that surrounds the mammalian oocyte.\nWe made a hole in the ZPs using a Piezo drill and mechanically separated them from the oocyte cytoplasm. A subset of ZPs were further purified through decellularization. Using a modified ICSI approach, we injected sperm heads into purified ZPs and tested the efficacy of cryopreservation and recovery of spermatozoon as well as function.\nBetween 1-6 sperm heads were injected into purified ZPs (average 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 sperm heads/ZP), which were then cryopreserved. Upon thawing, an average of 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 sperm heads/ZP were observed, and in 11 of 12 thawed \"sperm safes,\" we recovered all spermatozoa. Decellularized \"sperm safes\" maintained their three-dimensional structure and had a denser matrix relative to untreated controls as assessed by scanning and transmitted electron microscopy. The efficacy of \"sperm safe\" derived spermatozoon was evaluated by ICSI. Spermatozoon stored in either untreated or decellularized \"sperm safes\" elicited egg activation-associated calcium transients and zinc sparks when injected into eggs. Of the resulting zygotes, >80% of them formed pronuclei irrespective of the sperm source. 26.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6% and 18.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0% of the pre-implantation embryos generated from spermatozoon recovered from untreated or decellularized \"sperm safes\" developed to the blastocyst stage, respectively.

{"title": "Emerging Nanomedicine-Enabled/Enhanced Nanodynamic Therapies beyond Traditional Photodynamics.", "abstract": "The rapid knowledge growth of nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology enables and promotes the emergence of distinctive disease-specific therapeutic modalities, among which nanomedicine-enabled/augmented nanodynamic therapy (NDT), as triggered by either exogenous or endogenous activators on nanosensitizers, can generate reactive radicals for accomplishing efficient disease nanotherapies with mitigated side effects and endowed disease specificity. As one of the most representative modalities of NDT, traditional light-activated photodynamics suffers from the critical and unsurmountable issues of the low tissue-penetration depth of light and the phototoxicity of the photosensitizers. To overcome these obstacles, versatile nanomedicine-enabled/augmented NDTs have been explored for satisfying varied biomedical applications, which strongly depend on the physicochemical properties of the involved nanomedicines and nanosensitizers. These distinctive NDTs refer to sonodynamic therapy (SDT), thermodynamic therapy (TDT), electrodynamic therapy (EDT), piezoelectric dynamic therapy (PZDT), pyroelectric dynamic therapy (PEDT), radiodynamic therapy (RDT), and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, the critical roles, functions, and biological effects of nanomedicine (e.g., sonosensitizing, photothermal-converting, electronic, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, radiation-sensitizing, and catalytic properties) for enabling the therapeutic procedure of NDTs, are highlighted and discussed, along with the underlying therapeutic principle and optimization strategy for augmenting disease-therapeutic efficacy and biosafety.

{"title": "Sensorless Self-Excited Vibrational Viscometer with Two Hopf Bifurcations Based on a Piezoelectric Device.", "abstract": "In this study, we propose a high-sensitivity sensorless viscometer based on a piezoelectric device. Viscosity is an essential parameter frequently used in many fields. The vibration type viscometer based on self-excited oscillation generally requires displacement sensor although they can measure high viscosity without deterioration of sensitivity. The proposed viscometer utilizes the sensorless self-excited oscillation without any detection of the displacement of the cantilever, which uses the interaction between the mechanical dynamics of the cantilever and the electrical dynamics of the piezoelectric device attached to the cantilever. Since the proposed viscometer has fourth-order dynamics and two coupled oscillator systems, the systems can produce different self-excited oscillations through different Hopf bifurcations. We theoretically showed that the response frequency jumps at the two Hopf bifurcation points and this distance between them depends on the viscosity. Using this distance makes measurement highly sensitive and easier because the jump in the response frequency can be easily detected. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed sensorless viscometer by a macro-scale measurement system. The results show the sensitivity of the proposed method is higher than that of the previous method based on self-excited oscillation with a displacement sensor.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-02-11", "authors": ["ShinpachiroUrasaki", "HiroshiYabuno", "YasuyukiYamamoto", "SoheiMatsumoto"], "doi": "10.3390/s21041127\n10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2011.12.001\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.03.011\n10.1016/0095-8522(51)90018-9\n10.1121/1.1906989\n10.1016/j.measurement.2014.05.004\n10.1126/science.1411505\n10.1016/S0006-3495(03)75014-0\n10.1038/nnano.2007.388\n10.1021/je700675h\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.07.035\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.930\n10.1122/1.1475978\n10.1063/1.116626\n10.1557/mrs2009.121\n10.1007/s00542-012-1437-9\n10.1116/1.586300\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.09.006\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.04.050\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.05.052\n10.1063/1.4896487\n10.1115/1.4030975\n10.1016/S0304-3991(03)00068-8\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.09.084\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa7a6f\n10.1063/1.4995386\n10.1063/1.370999\n10.1016/j.bios.2006.06.011\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.11.052\n10.1016/j.matpr.2019.03.186\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.10.041\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.11.033\n10.1023/A:1008347523779\n10.1016/j.ajmsc.2013.10.002\n10.1021/je970008x"}

{"title": "Modeling of a Symmetric Five-Bar Displacement Amplification Compliant Mechanism for Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "This paper presents an analytical model to determine a closed form mathematical representation for the output displacement of a displacement amplification compliant mechanism used for energy harvesting. A symmetric five-bar compliant mechanism with right-circular and corner-filleted flexure hinges was mathematically modeled and its displacement was determined using the Castigliano energy theorem. The stresses within the flexure joints, the weakest points in the mechanism body, were calculated. The mathematical model expresses both the displacement amplification and the stresses as functions of the design parameters and the load caused by the harvester. The developed model can be used to optimize the mechanism dimensions for maximum harvested power, while minimizing its structural stresses. The mechanism was also modeled numerically using finite element methods; both the analytical and numerical models were verified experimentally. The mathematical model of the mechanism was integrated with a model representing a piezoelectric energy harvester to calculate the open-circuit voltage. As a proof of concept, experiments were performed using an unimorph piezoelectric cantilever at low-frequency (less than 1 Hz) harmonic excitation inputs. The measured open-circuit voltage was found to be in agreement with that calculated using the proposed model, when integrated with the model representing the piezoelectric beam. The power generated by the piezoelectric harvester, equipped with the proposed displacement amplification mechanism, was more than a hundred times that without amplification.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-02-11", "authors": ["Moataz MElsisy", "Mustafa HArafa", "Chahinaz ASaleh", "Yasser HAnis"], "doi": "10.3390/s21041095\n10.1088/0957-0233/21/2/022001\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073\n10.1002/admt.201900177\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.01.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.07.001\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.11.021\n10.1115/1.4005824\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113871\n10.1016/j.jsv.2015.12.048\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.917125\n10.1088/1742-6596/557/1/012135\n10.1002/stc.465\n10.1177/1045389X16641220\n10.1115/IMECE201551904\n10.1115/SMASIS2015-8829\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa7a83\n10.1115/1.4032178\n10.1002/9781118516485\n10.1115/1.1900750\n10.1177/1045389X18754352\n10.1115/1.4040628\n10.1007/s00158-005-0584-3\n10.1016/S0045-7825(00)00278-4\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2003.07.003\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2013.12.001\n10.1115/detc2005-84371\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.03.051"}
{"title": "The prognostic value of Piezo1 in breast cancer patients with various clinicopathological features.", "abstract": "The effects of piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1) in sensing extracellular mechanical stress have been well investigated. Recently, Piezo1's vital role in cancerogenesis has been demonstrated by many studies. Nonetheless, the prognostic value of Piezo1 in cancer still remains unexplored and unclear. This article aims to investigate the prognostic value of Piezo1 in breast cancer. Human Protein Atlas and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were used to examine Piezo1 expression in different human tissues and human cell lines. The discrepancies of Piezo1 mRNA expression in breast cancer patients with different clinicopathological features were assessed using bc-GenExMiner. The prognostic value of Piezo1 in breast cancer patients was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plotter. Piezo1 mRNA was extensively expressed in human tissues and cell lines, particularly in breast and cancerous breast cancer cell line MCF7. High Piezo1 expression was found correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer. Survival analysis further confirmed unfavorable prognosis of high Piezo1 expression in breast cancer patients with lymph node positive, estrogen receptor positive, Grade 2 (Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system), luminal A, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression, respectively. This study suggested that Piezo1 can serve as a prognostic indicator of breast cancer.", "journal": "Anti-cancer drugs", "date": "2021-02-10", "authors": ["HuiXu", "ZhuoChen", "ChouyangLi"], "doi": "10.1097/CAD.0000000000001049\n10.1002/mc.22831\n10.1093/abbs/gmaa112"}

The two-stage flexure hinge structure is used to provide horizontal thrust and vertical clamping force to the driving feet, which solves the problems of unstable clamping force and insufficient load capacity in traditional stick-slip piezoelectric actuators. Firstly, the main structure of the driver and the working process under the triangular wave excitation voltage are briefly introduced. Secondly, after many simulation tests, the structure of the actuator is optimized and the stability of the structure in providing clamping force is verified. Finally, through the research of the operating performance, when the amplitude is 150 V and the frequency is 3.25 kHz as the excitation source, the maximum speed can reach 338 mm/s and can bear about 3 kg load.

{"title": "Stereocilia Bundle Imaging with Nanoscale Resolution in Live Mammalian Auditory Hair Cells.", "abstract": "Inner ear hair cells detect sound-induced displacements and transduce these stimuli into electrical signals in a hair bundle that consists of stereocilia that are arranged in rows of increasing height. When stereocilia are deflected, they tug on tiny (~5 nm in diameter) extracellular tip links interconnecting stereocilia, which convey forces to the mechanosensitive transduction channels. Although mechanotransduction has been studied in live hair cells for decades, the functionally important ultrastructural details of the mechanotransduction machinery at the tips of stereocilia (such as tip link dynamics or transduction-dependent stereocilia remodeling) can still be studied only in dead cells with electron microscopy. Theoretically, scanning probe techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, have enough resolution to visualize the surface of stereocilia. However, independent of imaging mode, even the slightest contact of the atomic force microscopy probe with the stereocilia bundle usually damages the bundle. Here we present a detailed protocol for the hopping probe ion conductance microscopy (HPICM) imaging of live rodent auditory hair cells. This non-contact scanning probe technique allows time lapse imaging of the surface of live cells with a complex topography, like hair cells, with single nanometers resolution and without making physical contact with the sample. The HPICM uses an electrical current passing through the glass nanopipette to detect the cell surface in close vicinity to the pipette, while a 3D-positioning piezoelectric system scans the surface and generates its image. With HPICM, we were able to image stereocilia bundles and the links interconnecting stereocilia in live auditory hair cells for several hours without noticeable damage. We anticipate that the use of HPICM will allow direct exploration of ultrastructural changes in the stereocilia of live hair cells for better understanding of their function.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2021-02-09", "authors": ["CarolinaGaleano-Naranjo", "A CatalinaVel\u00e9z-Ortega", "Gregory IFrolenkov"], "doi": "10.3791/62104"}
{"title": "Assembly and Operation of an Acoustofluidic Device for Enhanced Delivery of Molecular Compounds to Cells.", "abstract": "Efficient intracellular delivery of biomolecules is required for a broad range of biomedical research and cell-based therapeutic applications. Ultrasound-mediated sonoporation is an emerging technique for rapid intracellular delivery of biomolecules. Sonoporation occurs when cavitation of gas-filled microbubbles forms transient pores in nearby cell membranes, which enables rapid uptake of biomolecules from the surrounding fluid. Current techniques for in vitro sonoporation of cells in suspension are limited by slow throughput, variability in the ultrasound exposure conditions for each cell, and high cost. To address these limitations, a low-cost acoustofluidic device has been developed which integrates an ultrasound transducer in a PDMS-based fluidic device to induce consistent sonoporation of cells as they flow through the channels in combination with ultrasound contrast agents. The device is fabricated using standard photolithography techniques to produce the PDMS-based fluidic chip. An ultrasound piezo disk transducer is attached to the device and driven by a microcontroller. The assembly can be integrated inside a 3D-printed case for added protection. Cells and microbubbles are pushed through the device using a syringe pump or a peristaltic pump connected to PVC tubing. Enhanced delivery of biomolecules to human T cells and lung cancer cells is demonstrated with this acoustofluidic system. Compared to bulk treatment approaches, this acoustofluidic system increases throughput and reduces variability, which can improve cell processing methods for biomedical research applications and manufacturing of cell-based therapeutics.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2021-02-09", "authors": ["Connor SCentner", "Emily MMurphy", "Bryce FStamp", "Mariah CPriddy", "John TMoore", "Paula JBates", "Michael AMenze", "KavithaYaddanapudi", "Jonathan AKopechek"], "doi": "10.3791/62035"}
{"title": "Brush-Paintable Black Electrodes for Poly(vinylidene fluoride)-Based Flexible Piezoelectric Devices.", "abstract": "We investigated simple and unrestricted brush-paintable black electrodes for poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based artistic flexible piezoelectric devices. The conductive black ink for paintable electrodes was synthesized by mixing poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and typical black ink and optimizing the mixing ratio. At an optimal mixing ratio, the brush-paintable black electrodes showed a sheet resistance of 151 \u03a9/sq and high coatability for flexible piezoelectric devices. Noticeably, higher black ink ratios increased adhesion forces, while diminished the shear flow of the conductive black ink. In addition, the optimized conductive black electrode exhibited an outstanding level of mechanical flexibility due to good adhesion between the black electrode and the PVDF substrate. During the repeated inner/outer bending fatigue tests with high strain, no resistance change confirmed the outstanding flexibility of the brush-paintable conductive electrode. As a promising application of the brush-paintable optimized black electrode, we suggested highly flexible piezoelectric devices that can be used. A PVDF-based piezoelectric speaker and a generator with the brush-paintable black electrode showed acoustic and output signal values approximate to those of metallic electrodes fabricated by vacuum-based high-cost thermal evaporators.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors, which was more prone to occur in the metaphysis of long bones, including distal femur and proximal tibia. However, the detailed mechanisms were not fully clear. The purpose of this research was to reveal the functional mechanisms of circ_0007534 and miR-219a-5p in OS.\nThe levels of genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot assay. Cell proliferation ability was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion abilities were measured using the transwell assay. Furthermore, the interaction between miR-219a-5p and circ_0007534 or SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 5 (SOX5) was predicted by starbaseV3.0, and confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay.

{"title": "Anisotropic Piezoelectric Response from InGaN Nanowires with Spatially Modulated Composition and Topography over a Textured Si(100) Substrate.", "abstract": "An anisotropic piezoelectric response is demonstrated from InGaN nanowires (NWs) over a pyramid-textured Si(100) substrate with an interfacet composition and topography modulation induced by stationary molecular beam epitaxy growth conditions, taking advantage of the unidirectional source beam flux. The variations of InGaN NWs between the pyramid facets are verified in terms of morphology, element distribution, and crystalline properties. The piezoelectric response is investigated by electrical atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a statistic analyzing method. Representative pyramids from the ensemble, on top of which InGaN NWs grown with a substrate held at an oblique angle, were characterized for understanding and confirming the degree of anisotropy. The positive deviated oscillation of the peak force error is identified as a measure of the effective AFM tip/NW interaction with respect to the electrical contact and mechanical deformation. The Schottky contact between the metal-coated AFM tip and the NWs on the different facets reveals distinctions consistent with the interfacet composition variation. The interfacet variation of the piezoelectric response of the InGaN NWs is first evaluated by electrical AFM under zero bias. The average current monotonically depends on the scan frequency, which determines the average peak force error, that is, mechanical deformation, with a facet characteristic slope. A piezoelectric nanogenerator device is fabricated out of a sample with an ensemble of pyramids, which exhibits anisotropic output under periodic directional pressing.

{"title": "Influence of dipole and intermolecular interaction on the tuning dielectric and energy storage properties of polystyrene-based polymers.", "abstract": "A dielectric polymer with high energy density is in high demand in modern electric and electronic systems. The current polymer dielectrics are facing the tradeoff between high energy density and low energy loss. Although many efforts have been devoted to solving the problem by modifying biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and glassy polymers, limited success has been achieved. In the present work, we disperse the high polar nitrile units in a low polar polystyrene (PSt) matrix to avoid the strong coupling force among the adjacent polar groups and reduce the relaxation-induced high dielectric loss. In addition, the possible charge transportation offered by phenyl groups could be blocked by the enlarged bandgap. Notably, the induced polarization is established between the nitrile and phenyl groups, which may lead to the copolymer chain being more densely packed. As a result, excellent energy storage performances, including the high energy density and low loss, are achieved in the resultant poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (AS). For instance, AS-4 exhibits a Ue of 11.4 J cm-3 and \u03b7 of 91% at ambient temperature and 550 MV m-1.

{"title": "A Physical Perspective to the Inductive Function of Myelin-A Missing Piece of Neuroscience.", "abstract": "Starting from the inductance in neurons, two physical origins are discussed, which are the coil inductance of myelin and the piezoelectric effect of the cell membrane. The direct evidence of the coil inductance of myelin is the opposite spiraling phenomenon between adjacent myelin sheaths confirmed by previous studies. As for the piezoelectric effect of the cell membrane, which has been well-known in physics, the direct evidence is the mechanical wave accompany with action potential. Therefore, a more complete physical nature of neural signals is provided. In conventional neuroscience, the neural signal is a pure electrical signal. In our new theory, the neural signal is an energy pulse containing electrical, magnetic, and mechanical components. Such a physical understanding of the neural signal and neural systems significantly improve the knowledge of the neurons. On the one hand, we achieve a corrected neural circuit of an inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC) form, whose frequency response and electrical characteristics have been validated by previous studies and the modeling fitting of artifacts in our experiments. On the other hand, a number of phenomena observed in neural experiments are explained. In particular, they are the mechanism of magnetic nerve stimulations and ultrasound nerve stimulations, the MRI image contrast issue and Anode Break Excitation. At last, the biological function of myelin is summarized. It is to provide inductance in the process of neural signal, which can enhance the signal speed in peripheral nervous systems and provide frequency modulation function in central nervous systems.", "journal": "Frontiers in neural circuits", "date": "2021-02-05", "authors": ["HaoWang", "JiahuiWang", "GuangyiCai", "YonghongLiu", "YansongQu", "TianzhunWu"], "doi": "10.3389/fncir.2020.562005\n10.1146/annurev.biophys.36.040306.132643\n10.1016/B978-0-12-396534-9.00009-X\n10.1038/1911104a0\n10.1016/j.jns.2013.01.018\n10.1109/58.949746\n10.1038/nrn2148\n10.1083/jcb.109.1.273\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19970801)49:3<;372::AID-JNR12>;3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1085/jgp.25.1.29\n10.1085/jgp.24.6.771\n10.1002/jcp.1030190202\n10.1109/TBME.1970.4502680\n10.1111/ejn.12001\n10.1113/jphysiol.1972.sp009984\n10.1126/science.1253851\n10.1126/science.133.3470.2058\n10.1016/j.bpc.2016.06.005\n10.1016/S0006-3495(69)86385-X\n10.1016/0378-5955(84)90094-7\n10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764\n10.1093/jxb/35.9.1309\n10.1088/1741-2560/12/5/056015\n10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01547-2\n10.1007/BF01709799\n10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00061-6\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67052219.x\n10.2142/biophysico.14.0_147\n10.1073/pnas.0910222107\n10.1016/0014-4886(76)90236-3\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.038\n10.1002/mrm.22482\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.09.057\n10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019467\n10.1085/jgp.55.4.497\n10.3390/membranes5040495\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002022\n10.1016/j.aca.2006.01.108\n10.1016/S0014-4886(63)80006-0\n10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77895-6\n10.1007/BF00236630\n10.1016/S0092-8240(77)80034-7\n10.1063/1.5000706\n10.1016/S0006-3495(85)83763-2\n10.1142/S1793048010001147\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.005\n10.1016/0025-5564(71)90089-7\n10.12688/f1000research.9277.1\n10.1085/jgp.42.1.39\n10.1002/mrm.24629\n10.1103/PhysRevB.34.5883\n10.1080/01411599108213201\n10.1007/BF01870172\n10.1088/0022-3727/46/9/093001\n10.1126/science.1249766\n10.1083/jcb.3.4.589\n10.1016/j.bpj.2018.06.004\n10.1073/pnas.1211075109\n10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80115-3\n10.1002/mrm.26689\n10.1073/pnas.1206037109\n10.1007/BF01834479\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2016.02.012\n10.1088/0957-4484/24/43/432001\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-071312-121634"}

The AFM probe is used to deflect individual piezoelectric nanorods and to measure the resultant current. However, the torsion data of AFM probes have not been exploited to elucidate the relationship between the applied mechanical force and resultant current. In this study, the effect of the size of ZnO nanorods on the efficiency of conversion of the applied mechanical force into current was investigated by simultaneously acquiring the conductive AFM and lateral force microscopy signals. The conversion efficiency was calculated based on linear regression analysis of the scatter plot of the data. This method is suitable for determining the conversion efficiencies of all types of freestanding piezoelectric nanomaterials grown under different conditions. A pixel-wise comparison of the current and lateral force images elucidated the mechanism of current generation from dense arrays of ZnO nanorods. The current signals generated from the ZnO nanorods by the AFM probe originated from the piezoelectric and triboelectric effects.

{"title": "The Role of the Fiber/Bead Hierarchical Microstructure on the Properties of PVDF Coatings Deposited by Electrospinning.", "abstract": "Among the various polymeric options employed for the deposition of electrospun coatings, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) has been widely investigated thanks to its excellent mechanical properties, high chemical resistance, and good thermal stability. In this work, the electrospinning technique is used for the fabrication of functional PVDF fibers in order to identify and evaluate the influence of the experimental conditions on the nanofiber properties in terms of optical transmittance, wettability, corrosion resistance, and surface morphology. Some of these properties can play a relevant role in the prevention of ice formation in aircrafts. According to this, a matrix of 4 \u00d7 4 samples of aluminum alloy AA 6061T6 was successfully coated by controlling two operational input parameters such as the resultant applied voltage (from 10 up to 17.5 KV) and the flow rate (from 800 up to 1400 \u00b5L/h) for a fixed polymeric precursor concentration (15 wt.%). The experimental results have shown a multilevel fiber-bead structure where the formation of a fiber mesh directly depends on the selected operational parameters. Several microscopy and surface analysis techniques such as confocal microscopy (CM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), UV/vis spectroscopy, and water contact angle (WCA) were carried out in order to corroborate the morphology, transmittance, and hydrophobicity of the electrospun fiber composite.

{"title": "The role of Piezo1 in conventional aqueous humor outflow dynamics.", "abstract": "Controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the mainstay of glaucoma therapy. The trabecular meshwork (TM), the key tissue responsible for aqueous humor (AH) outflow and IOP maintenance, is very sensitive to mechanical forces. However, it is not understood whether Piezo channels, very sensitive mechanosensors, functionally influence AH outflow. Here, we characterize the role of Piezo1 in conventional AH outflow. Immunostaining and western blot analysis showed that Piezo1 is widely expressed by TM. Patch-clamp recordings in TM cells confirmed the activation of Piezo1-derived mechanosensitive currents. Importantly, the antagonist GsMTx4 for mechanosensitive channels significantly decreased steady-state facility, yet activation of Piezo1 by the specific agonist Yoda1 did not lead to a facility change. Furthermore, GsMTx4, but not Yoda1, caused a significant increase in ocular compliance, a measure of the eye's transient response to IOP perturbation. Our findings demonstrate a potential role for Piezo1 in conventional outflow, likely under pathological and rapid transient conditions.", "journal": "iScience", "date": "2021-02-04", "authors": ["WeiZhu", "FeiHou", "JingwangFang", "Mohammad RezaBahrani Fard", "YaniLiu", "ShouyanRen", "ShenWu", "YunkunQi", "ShangruSui", "A ThomasRead", "Joseph MSherwood", "WeiZou", "HongxiaYu", "JingxueZhang", "Darryl ROverby", "NingliWang", "C RossEthier", "KeWeiWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isci.2021.102042\n10.1113/jp281011"}
{"title": "Conical shell vibration optimal control with distributed piezoelectric sensor and actuator layers.", "abstract": "In this study, conical shell vibration with distributed piezoelectric layers on the shell surface is controlled by a distributed optimal controller. Two piezoelectric layers are distributed on the conical shell surface with the same geometry and they are segmented into the same numbers of patches. One piezoelectric layer is considered to be a sensor layer and the other one is considered to be an actuator layer. An optimal controller with various constants for each piezoelectric patch is determined with an optimal input voltage. The conical shell electromechanical equations of motions with piezoelectric layers are extracted. The Galerkin method is used for obtaining the time domain equations and after that optimal constants of the controller are determined. Various kinds of distribution for the piezoelectric layer are considered and their effects on the conical shell vibration control are evaluated. For a better assessment, free vibration response, forced vibration response with concentrated and distributed force, and the frequency response of the considered system are computed and compared with the uncontrolled response. The results show the high impact of the optimal controller on the vibration mitigation of the conical shell and also the actuator applied voltage amplitude is considerably low. The applicability of the piezoelectric layer in the conical shell vibration mitigation is vividly determined by using an optimal controller which decreases the actuator applied voltage amplitude dramatically.", "journal": "ISA transactions", "date": "2021-02-04", "authors": ["RasaJamshidi", "AliasgharJafari"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isatra.2021.01.037"}
{"title": "Review of Current Guided Wave Ultrasonic Testing (GWUT) Limitations and Future Directions.", "abstract": "Damage is an inevitable occurrence in metallic structures and when unchecked could result in a catastrophic breakdown of structural assets. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is adopted in industries for assessment and health inspection of structural assets. Prominent among the NDE techniques is guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT). This method is cost-effective and possesses an enormous capability for long-range inspection of corroded structures, detection of sundries of crack and other metallic damage structures at low frequency and energy attenuation. However, the parametric features of the GWUT are affected by structural and environmental operating conditions and result in masking damage signal. Most studies focused on identifying individual damage under varying conditions while combined damage phenomena can coexist in structure and hasten its deterioration. Hence, it is an impending task to study the effect of combined damage on a structure under varying conditions and correlate it with GWUT parametric features. In this respect, this work reviewed the literature on UGWs, damage inspection, severity, temperature influence on the guided wave and parametric characteristics of the inspecting wave. The review is limited to the piezoelectric transduction unit. It was keenly observed that no significant work had been done to correlate the parametric feature of GWUT with combined damage effect under varying conditions. It is therefore proposed to investigate this impending task.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-02-04", "authors": ["Samuel ChukwuemekaOlisa", "Muhammad AKhan", "AndrewStarr"], "doi": "10.3390/s21030811\n10.1016/j.jlp.2017.04.030\n10.1007/BF02479416\n10.1121/1.2932071\n10.1016/j.ultras.2005.05.001\n10.3390/s19235174\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.440-441.195\n10.3390/s19132930\n10.1177/1045389X12447987\n10.1177/0021998318766595\n10.1177/1045389X04038051\n10.1038/nature01846\n10.1242/jeb.013862\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014054\n10.1121/1.3147497\n10.1002/stc.2007\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2693319\n10.1016/j.jsv.2012.04.033\n10.1117/12.2009458\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2020.107411\n10.3390/app8101815\n10.1121/1.4894801\n10.1109/JPROC.2015.2451218\n10.1016/0041-624X(65)90192-7\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2835146\n10.1016/0020-7683(92)90133-E\n10.1115/1.2900800\n10.1108/IJSI-09-2015-0039\n10.3390/app7050510\n10.5545/sv-jme.2015.2674\n10.1784/insi.2019.61.4.222\n10.1061/9780784413142.009?src=recsys\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00038-3\n10.3390/app9204254\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.05.041\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2008.06.049\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.11.003\n10.12989/sss.2014.14.5.917\n10.1177/0954406216681594\n10.1117/1.OE.55.1.011003\n10.1177/1045389X13500572\n10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2507443\n10.1109/58.143172\n10.21595/vp.2018.20262\n10.1631/jzus.A1500184\n10.3390/s18124470\n10.1121/1.1908685\n10.1121/1.4978244\n10.1017/S0001924000003523\n10.1784/insi.2008.50.9.480\n10.1007/s00419-019-01552-x\n10.1016/S0041-624X(01)00082-8\n10.1117/12.2044789\n10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0001674\n10.3390/mi11080763\n10.3390/s18072122\n10.1007/s10921-017-0443-3\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561631\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106788\n10.1117/12.2309975\n10.3390/s18113958\n10.1063/1.2956396\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/3/035003\n10.1177/1045389X06071435\n10.1016/S0041-624X(02)00455-9\n10.1155/2015/290714\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/11/115010\n10.24018/ejers.2017.2.8.374\n10.1186/2228-5547-4-35\n10.3982/ECTA6706\n10.1016/j.watres.2009.12.020\n10.1016/j.apcbee.2012.06.077\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2018.06.003\n10.3390/met7050182\n10.1117/12.2221893\n10.3390/s17122882\n10.1088/0957-0233/12/8/341\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.01.017\n10.1143/JJAP.50.07HC17\n10.1016/j.jsv.2019.115134\n10.3901/CJME.2011.03.487\n10.1117/12.715016\n10.1177/1461348419886189\n10.1016/S0041-624X(99)00047-5\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.12.001\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.01.052\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2009)22:2(185)\n10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.004\n10.1117/12.2046347\n10.1177/1045389X16651155\n10.1002/pamm.201610059\n10.1177/1045389X07086691\n10.1117/12.474650\n10.1177/104538902761696733\n10.12989/smm.2017.4.4.301\n10.2514/1.44776\n10.1063/1.2407269\n10.1177/1045389X16657427"}
{"title": "Design and fabrication of an E-whisker using a PVDF ring.", "abstract": "Mammalian whiskers can perceive obstacles and airflows. In this study, an electronic whisker (E-whisker) sensor was designed and fabricated by setting a PVDF ring with symmetrical electrodes on the root of a fiber beam. Vibration displacements with different waveforms were applied at the free end of the E-whisker beam to study the relationship between the vibration displacements and the output signals. The E-whisker protrusion sensing ability was investigated by driving it to sweep through the surface of a base platform. A static E-whisker beam and a swinging E-whisker were then separately placed in a wind tunnel to detect the airflow perception of the sensor. The experimental results suggested that the E-whisker could sense the frequencies and amplitudes of displacements at its free end, the height and width of a platform or the heights of other irregular protrusions; the static E-whisker could sense the magnitude or direction of an impact airflow, while the swinging E-whisker could sense the magnitude of a constant airflow. Thus, this kind of E-whisker could perceive the environment and airflow through touch sensation and could be used as a physical model to study the principles and abilities of animal whiskers to perceive obstacles and airflows.", "journal": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "date": "2021-02-03", "authors": ["YaniJiang", "JialingLi", "ZhiWang", "YongbinQin", "GuangmingGuo", "ZaixiangZheng", "YixiangBian"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-3190/abe27a"}

{"title": "Ultrathin two-dimensional Fe-doped cobaltous oxide as a piezoelectric enhancement mechanism in quartz crystal tuning fork (QCTF) photodetectors.", "abstract": "An innovative ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) Fe-doped cobaltous oxide (Fe-CoO) coated quartz crystal tuning fork (QCTF) was introduced for the purpose of developing a low-cost photoelectric detector with a simple configuration. The enhancement mechanism of the piezoelectric signal in the ultrathin 2D Fe-CoO-coated QCTF detector is assumed to be the synergetic photocarrier transfer and photothermal effect of ultrathin 2D Fe-CoO. The ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure of Fe-CoO with a large specific surface area can efficiently absorb and convert light into heat in the QCTF, and the photocarrier transfer from the Fe-CoO nanosheet to the electrode of the QCTF contributes to the enhancement in electricity given the shortened diffusion distance of carriers to the surfaces of the 2D nanosheet. Finite element modeling was adopted to simulate the thermoelastic expansion and mechanical resonance of the QCTF with 2D Fe-CoO coating to support experimental results and analyses. Moreover, the effects of 2D Fe-CoO on the performance of QCTF-based photoelectric detectors were investigated.

An electromechanical (EM) piezoelectric-based system is one of the potential technologies that can produce a compactable system with a fast response and a high power density. However, piezoelectric materials generate a small strain, of around 0.1-0.2% of the original actuator length, limiting their potential in large-scale applications.

In this work, a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based unimorph cantilever actuator is developed with simulation and experimental studies on the effect of DC high voltages on heat production in the PVDF layer. A layer of one-way shape memory polymers (1W-SMPs) is integrated in the actuator to exploit the heat produced to increase the bending angle. The length and mounting location of the SMP layer impacts the bending of the actuator; by using an SMP layer with a length equal to half of the PVDF layer at the center of the unimorph actuator, the absolute bending angle is increased to 40\u00b0 compared to the base piezo bending angle of 4\u00b0 at 20 V/\u00b5m.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-02-03", "authors": ["SudarshanKalel", "Wei-ChihWang"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13030415\n10.1295/polymj.22.7\n10.1088/2631-6331/ab0f48\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.03.025\n10.1177/1045389X18803451\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab0844\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08095.x\n10.1007/s10853-005-7201-0\n10.1177/1045389X9500600308\n10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70047-0\n10.1080/02678292.2013.805832\n10.1039/b922943d\n10.1002/polb.23990"}
{"title": "Lamb Wave Scattering Analysis for Interface Damage Detection between a Surface-Mounted Block and Elastic Plate.", "abstract": "Since stringers are often applied in engineering constructions to improve thin-walled structures' strength, methods for damage detection at the joints between the stringer and the thin-walled structure are necessary. A 2D mathematical model was employed to simulate Lamb wave excitation and sensing via rectangular piezoelectric-wafer active transducers mounted on the surface of an elastic plate with rectangular surface-bonded obstacles (stiffeners) with interface defects. The results of a 2D simulation using the finite element method and the semi-analytical hybrid approach were validated experimentally using laser Doppler vibrometry for fully bonded and semi-debonded rectangular obstacles. A numerical analysis of fundamental Lamb wave scattering via rectangular stiffeners in different bonding states is presented. Two kinds of interfacial defects between the stiffener and the plate are considered: the partial degradation of the adhesive at the interface and an open crack. Damage indices calculated using the data obtained from a sensor are analyzed numerically. The choice of an input impulse function applied at the piezoelectric actuator is discussed from the perspective of the development of guided-wave-based structural health monitoring techniques for damage detection.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-02-03", "authors": ["Mikhail VGolub", "Alisa NShpak", "InkaMueller", "Sergey IFomenko", "Claus-PeterFritzen"], "doi": "10.3390/s21030860\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112813\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115566\n10.1177/1475921718784451\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.03.001\n10.3390/app10093068\n10.3390/s20030826\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00038-3\n10.3390/s16050638\n10.3390/aerospace5040111\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/032\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.06.009\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.02.088\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.09.067\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.10.046\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab6e9e\n10.3390/app10051880\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.11.002\n10.1016/j.ultras.2011.08.003\n10.1177/1475921713483351\n10.3390/s20061790\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/1/015020\n10.3390/app9214600\n10.1134/S1063771019060034\n10.1016/j.apm.2018.08.019\n10.1142/S0218396X01001169\n10.1088/0022-3727/49/45/455102\n10.1016/j.cma.2012.06.011\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112376\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2019.08.015\n10.1016/j.wavemoti.2010.09.003\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.11.021\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2019.02.002\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2011.07.009"}

{"title": "An Open Source Classifier for Bed Mattress Signal in Infant Sleep Monitoring.", "abstract": "To develop a non-invasive and clinically practical method for a long-term monitoring of infant sleep cycling in the intensive care unit.\nForty three infant polysomnography recordings were performed at 1-18 weeks of age, including a piezo element bed mattress sensor to record respiratory and gross-body movements. The hypnogram scored from polysomnography signals was used as the ground truth in training sleep classifiers based on 20,022 epochs of movement and/or electrocardiography signals. Three classifier designs were evaluated in the detection of deep sleep (N3 state): support vector machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory neural network, and convolutional neural network (CNN).\nDeep sleep was accurately identified from other states with all classifier variants. The SVM classifier based on a combination of movement and electrocardiography features had the highest performance (AUC 97.6%). A SVM classifier based on only movement features had comparable accuracy (AUC 95.0%). The feature-independent CNN resulted in roughly comparable accuracy (AUC 93.3%).\nAutomated non-invasive tracking of sleep state cycling is technically feasible using measurements from a piezo element situated under a bed mattress.\nAn open source infant deep sleep detector of this kind allows quantitative, continuous bedside assessment of infant's sleep cycling.", "journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "date": "2021-02-02", "authors": ["JukkaRanta", "ManuAiraksinen", "TurkkaKirjavainen", "SampsaVanhatalo", "Nathan JStevenson"], "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2020.602852\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2005.07.008\n10.1088/1741-2552/ab5469\n10.1109/tnsre.2007.897025\n10.1142/s012906571750023x\n10.1111/j.1651-2227.1990.tb11456.x\n10.1109/titb.2008.2007193\n10.5664/jcsm.26819\n10.1203/00006450-198706000-00010\n10.1016/0013-4694(87)90126-x\n10.1109/tbme.2006.881798\n10.1016/0013-4694(70)90143-4\n10.1002/dev.21482\n10.1016/0020-7101(93)90021-w\n10.2307/2986305\n10.1038/jp.2012.25\n10.1046/j.1365-2869.1996.t01-1-00003.x\n10.1203/pdr.0b013e31821ba200\n10.1177/2374373517747242\n10.1016/j.clinph.2017.02.025\n10.1109/titb.2010.2044797\n10.1016/j.bspc.2014.08.001\n10.1111/j.1542-474x.1996.tb00275.x\n10.1016/s0924-4247(99)00269-1\n10.1109/94.946715\n10.1109/tbme.1985.325532\n10.5664/jcsm.6288\n10.1103/physreve.49.1685\n10.1109/tpami.2005.159\n10.1088/2057-1976/aafbc8\n10.1016/0167-2789(93)90009-p\n10.1016/j.smrv.2010.10.001\n10.1016/j.clinph.2015.08.013\n10.1002/dev.21954\n10.1088/0967-3334/35/7/1493\n10.5664/jcsm.6514\n10.1109/tbme.2009.2038362\n10.1007/s11517-012-0918-4\n10.1093/sleep/10.2.122\n10.1016/0031-9384(79)90052-0\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2017.07.002\n10.1016/j.smrv.2016.03.005\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2017.07.004"}

{"title": "Mechanomyography and acceleration show interlimb asymmetries in Parkinson patients without tremor compared to controls during a unilateral motor task.", "abstract": "The mechanical muscular oscillations are rarely the objective of investigations regarding the identification of a biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether or not this specific motor output differs between PD patients and controls. The novelty is that patients without tremor are investigated performing a unilateral isometric motor task. The force of armflexors and the forearm acceleration (ACC) were recorded as well as the mechanomyography of the biceps brachii (MMGbi), brachioradialis (MMGbra) and pectoralis major (MMGpect) muscles using a piezoelectric-sensor-based system during a unilateral motor task at 70% of the MVIC. The frequency, a power-frequency-ratio, the amplitude variation, the slope of amplitudes and their interlimb asymmetries were analysed. The results indicate that the oscillatory behavior of muscular output in PD without tremor deviates from controls in some parameters: Significant differences appeared for the power-frequency-ratio (p\u2009=\u20090.001, r\u2009=\u20090.43) and for the amplitude variation (p\u2009=\u20090.003, r\u2009=\u20090.34) of MMGpect. The interlimb asymmetries differed significantly concerning the power-frequency-ratio of MMGbi (p\u2009=\u20090.013, r\u2009=\u20090.42) and MMGbra (p\u2009=\u20090.048, r\u2009=\u20090.39) as well as regarding the mean frequency (p\u2009=\u20090.004, r\u2009=\u20090.48) and amplitude variation of MMGpect (p\u2009=\u20090.033, r\u2009=\u20090.37).

The wide diameter distributions and multilevel pore structure of PS fibers were obtained by controlling the precursor solution compositions used in blow spinning. The PS fibrous sponge formed by accumulating naturally exhibited an ultralow density, whose oil adsorption capacity ranged from 74 to 440 g/g for various oils and organic solvents. To enhance the mechanical strength of the PS fibrous sponge, the PVDF/PS composite package with the sandwich structure was fabricated by alternately blow spinning. The PVDF/PS composite package possessed 2.7 times the tensile strength of the PS fibrous sponge while the oil adsorption capacity had merely a slight decrease.

Inverse hysteresis model-based control is difficult to maintain satisfied performance in presence of uncertainties and disturbances. Linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is a practical approach. However, phase lag of the total disturbance estimation degrades its estimation ability and tracking performance. In this work, a phase-leading extended state observer (PLESO) is constructed by adding a phase-leading network to a linear extended state observer. Advantage of the PLESO on estimating the time-varying total disturbance is analyzed, and influence of the multiplication factor introduced by a PLESO is also discussed. By a leading phase provided by the PLESO, the phase-leading active disturbance rejection control (PLADRC) can compensate the total disturbance timelier, and more satisfied positioning can be guaranteed. Experimental results show that the PLADRC is superior to the LADRC in terms of dynamic responses and disturbance rejection.

Through continuous attenuation monitoring of the guided waves, the evolution of mortar and concrete properties was characterized. Four different kinds of metallic rods were tested at the same time to find out the optimal setup.

{"title": "Flexural Damage Diagnosis in Reinforced Concrete Beams Using a Wireless Admittance Monitoring System-Tests and Finite Element Analysis.", "abstract": "The utilization and effectiveness of a custom-made, portable and low-cost structural health monitoring (SHM) system that implements the PZT-based electro-mechanical admittance (EMA) methodology for the detection and evaluation of the damage of flexural reinforced concrete (RC) beams is presented. Tests of large-scale beams under monotonic and cyclic reversal-imposed deformations have been carried out using an integrated wireless impedance/admittance monitoring system (WiAMS) that employs the voltage measurements of PZT transducers. Small-sized PZT patches that have been epoxy-bonded on the steel bars surface and on the external concrete face of the beams are utilized to diagnose damages caused by steel yielding and concrete cracking. Excitations and simultaneous measurements of the voltage signal responses of the PZT transducers have been carried out at different levels of the applied load during the tests using the developed SHM devices, which are remotely controlled by a terminal emulator. Each PZT output voltage versus frequency response is transferred wireless and in real-time. Statistical index values are calculated based on the signals of the PZT transducers to represent the differences between their baseline response at the healthy state of the beam and their response at each loading/damage level. Finite Element Modeling (FEM) simulation of the tested beams has also been performed to acquire numerical results concerning the internal cracks, the steel strains and the energy dissipation and instability parameters. FEM analyses are used to verify the experimental results and to support the visual observations for a more precise damage evaluation. Findings of this study indicate that the proposed SHM system with the implementation of two different PZT transducer settings can be effectively utilized for the assessment of structural damage caused by concrete cracking and steel yielding in flexural beams under monotonic and cyclic loading.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-01-28", "authors": ["Constantin EChalioris", "Violetta KKytinou", "Maristella EVoutetaki", "Chris GKarayannis"], "doi": "10.3390/s21030679\n10.1177/1475921710373296\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2011.06.006\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1994)120:11(3243)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1996)122:5(555)\n10.1088/0964-1726/7/5/013\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9845(199809)27:9<903::AID-EQE757>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1088/0964-1726/9/4/317\n10.3390/s16020234\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.011\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.10.124\n10.3390/s20143954\n10.1177/1045389X9700800903\n10.1106/QXMV-R3GC-VXXG-W3AQ\n10.3390/s19173775\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2004.05.018\n10.1117/12.599853\n10.3390/s19020383\n10.1177/1045389X11414219\n10.12989/smm.2014.1.1.001\n10.3390/s17020394\n10.3390/s18124312\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.02.017\n10.3390/s100505193\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.04.020\n10.1002/stc.1645\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.05.042\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.03.165\n10.1007/978-981-15-2806-4_62\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120348\n10.1177/1045389X13498317\n10.1177/1045389X14554133\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/006\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.074\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/11/115019\n10.12989/smm.2014.1.2.159\n10.1080/15732479.2013.831908\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.148\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.02.094\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80c2\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.12.173\n10.3390/s18051591\n10.7764/RDLC.18.2.282\n10.3390/s19020425\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111489\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.5281/zenodo.10.5281/zenodo.1090964\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.4.997\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.019\n10.1007/s40799-016-0097-6\n10.12989/sss.2018.22.1.000\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.046\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2003.07.001\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/7/075001\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/4/047001\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065026\n10.2495/ERES150191\n10.3390/s18103266\n10.3390/s18072171\n10.1155/2014/784731\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.03.046\n10.1007/s10921-012-0135-y\n10.1177/1475921712458708\n10.3390/s17092001\n10.3390/s17081930\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab3a08\n10.12989/sss.2020.25.4.423\n10.3390/s16101765\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.07.029\n10.1177/1475921705049752\n10.3390/s18051521\n10.3390/s20123410\n10.3390/s20102883\n10.12989/sss.2010.6.5_6.689\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.10.006\n10.1155/2013/932568\n10.2174/2405465801666160830155120\n10.12989/smm.2015.2.2.165\n10.1155/2013/978313\n10.3390/s17122880\n10.12989/sss.2012.9.6.489\n10.3390/s16081343\n10.3390/s17102239\n10.3390/s20041212\n10.3390/s18114018\n10.3390/s8010327\n10.3390/app6110341\n10.3390/s16050639\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.09.006\n10.3390/app9020312\n10.3390/app10010050\n10.1155/2016/2562949\n10.1515/eng-2015-0046\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.1016/j.cscm.2016.03.003\n10.12989/eas.2020.19.1.29\n10.1106/A1HU-23JD-M5AU-ENGW\n10.1115/1.1421056\n10.1007/s11803-003-0005-9\n10.1117/12.2084414\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2000)126:6(638)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2000)126:6(646)\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2020.107088\n10.1007/BF02486267\n10.1016/0020-7683(89)90050-4\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.04.016\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.06.047\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.06.039"}

{"title": "Evaluation of surface roughness after root resection: An optical profilometer study.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the roughness of the apical surface after apical resection performed by six different methods with an optical profilometer. Sixty human single root premolar teeth were used in this in vitro study. After root canal preparation, root canals were filled with gutta-percha and AH Plus root canal sealers by lateral condensation technique. The teeth were randomly divided into six groups according to the apical resection method: steel fissure bur, tungsten carbide fissure bur, Lindeman bur, diamond fissure bur, laser, and ultrasonic surgical piezo with a diamond tip. The root ends were resected 3\u2009mm away from the root apex and at a 90\u00b0 angle. The time required for apicectomy was recorded for each group. After apical resection, the root surfaces were analyzed by an optical profilometer. The Kruskal-Wallis method was used to analyze the differences between groups. The significance level was set at 5%. The roughest surfaces were obtained by laser (25.54\u2009\u00b1\u20099.01\u2009\u03bcm) and Lindeman bur (17.35\u2009\u00b1\u20096.03\u2009\u03bcm), respectively. The longest mean resection times were recorded in piezosurgery and laser surgery (57\u2009\u00b1\u200914.39\u2009s and 50.9 \u00b1\u200916.86\u2009s), respectively. Although the diamond-tipped piezo surgical cutting time is long, it has the best results in terms of surface roughness (5.50\u2009\u00b1\u20091.73\u2009\u03bcm). The optical profilometer is a more convenient tool for evaluating the surface after apical surgery, as it provides an opportunity to evaluate objectively with both visual and numerical data.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2021-01-26", "authors": ["\u00d6merEkici", "KubilayAslanta\u015f", "\u00d6zg\u00fcrKan\u0131k", "AliKele\u015f"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.23714"}
{"title": "Flexible ferroelectric wearable devices for medical applications.", "abstract": "Wearable electronics are becoming increasingly important for medical applications as they have revolutionized the way physiological parameters are monitored. Ferroelectric materials show spontaneous polarization below the Curie temperature, which changes with electric field, temperature, and mechanical deformation. Therefore, they have been widely used in sensor and actuator applications. In addition, these materials can be used for conversion of human-body energy into electricity for powering wearable electronics. In this paper, we review the recent advances in flexible ferroelectric materials for wearable human energy harvesting and sensing. To meet the performance requirements for medical applications, the most suitable materials and manufacturing techniques are reviewed. The approaches used to enhance performance and achieve long-term sustainability and multi-functionality by integrating other active sensing mechanisms (e.g. triboelectric and piezoresistive effects) are discussed. Data processing and transmission as well as the contribution of wearable piezoelectric devices in early disease detection and monitoring vital signs are reviewed.", "journal": "iScience", "date": "2021-01-26", "authors": ["Zois MichailTsikriteas", "James IRoscow", "Chris RBowen", "HamidehKhanbareh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isci.2020.101987\n10.3390/s120709884\n10.3390/s18103476\n10.2165/00007256-200333070-00004\n10.3390/app10020480\n10.1108/SR-07-2017-0126\n10.1002/aenm.201300427\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949335\n10.1002/ppul.21416\n10.1002/adfm.201504755\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2339739\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2013.11.027\n10.1016/j.orgel.2019.105547\n10.1016/j.mser.2018.04.001\n10.1080/01972243.2017.1391912\n10.1021/acsnano.8b02505\n10.1021/acsnano.8b02477\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/8/085020\n10.3390/s17030584\n10.1021/acsami.8b20284\n10.1021/acsami.8b13535\n10.1039/C5TC02173A\n10.1002/admt.202000046\n10.1002/smll.201604245\n10.1002/aelm.201600540\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.10.021\n10.1038/s41565-018-0226-8\n10.1002/adma.201706299\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2006.08.020\n10.1038/nmat4289\n10.1038/ncomms5496\n10.1038/39827\n10.1016/j.tsf.2011.08.050\n10.1002/aenm.201802190\n10.1109/JPROC.2019.2929286\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.05.057\n10.3390/coatings10111094\n10.1126/science.aay7221\n10.3390/s20102820\n10.1080/10584580600949048\n10.3390/en11071850\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.045\n10.3390/s20041160\n10.1039/C7TC00038C\n10.1002/adma.201902133\n10.1021/acsaelm.9b00363\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104516\n10.1002/anie.201511805\n10.1016/j.isci.2020.101360\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.033\n10.1002/adma.201902034\n10.1002/adma.201907336\n10.1016/B978-0-323-37468-2.00011-7\n10.1002/adhm.201700024\n10.1002/adma.201401364\n10.1080/15583724.2020.1729180\n10.1038/s41598-019-44420-y\n10.1117/12.2548873\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2375203\n10.1002/adma.201504366\n10.1002/adfm.201700341\n10.1002/aelm.201600260\n10.1002/smll.201402495\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.056\n10.1002/adfm.201801834\n10.1016/j.solmat.2008.10.004\n10.21037/jtd.2017.10.166\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2934943\n10.1038/srep07887\n10.1038/s41598-017-18571-9\n10.1021/acsnano.8b01805\n10.3390/s150818801\n10.1016/S1369-7021(06)71446-8\n10.1039/C8NR09959F\n10.1002/admi.202000743\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.124205\n10.34133/2020/8710686\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2597312\n10.1002/adma.201901924\n10.1021/jz301805f\n10.1002/adma.201504196\n10.3390/s18020645\n10.1088/1361-6641/aa68d1\n10.1002/admt.201900717\n10.1016/j.mser.2019.100523\n10.3390/mi8010012\n10.1002/adma.201902062\n10.1016/j.matpr.2020.01.282\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2651073\n10.1021/acsapm.9b00846\n10.1038/nmat2834\n10.1097/NOR.0b013e3182a39caf\n10.1002/adfm.201806388\n10.1016/j.aej.2019.09.008\n10.1039/C2RA22929C\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b02088\n10.1002/adma.201702308\n10.1002/adma.201305659\n10.1021/acsami.6b07833\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.107963\n10.1080/10426910500464446\n10.1021/nl104412b\n10.1016/j.matlet.2019.127119\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2750241\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/3/033001\n10.1016/B978-185617431-2/50006-2\n10.1140/epjst/e2015-02600-y\n10.1021/acsami.9b21636\n10.1002/adma.201802898\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1253181\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2965083\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.05.022\n10.1002/adma.201401052\n10.1038/s41598-018-22746-3\n10.3390/s17071622\n10.1007/s11431-018-9386-9\n10.1016/B978-1-78242-465-9.00012-4\n10.1038/s41598-019-45422-6\n10.1155/2015/352036\n10.1016/j.mattod.2019.08.005\n10.1007/978-1-4614-9625-0_1\n10.1038/s41551-020-00612-w\n10.3390/s19092170\n10.1039/C7TC02558K\n10.1002/aelm.201900922\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.03.013\n10.1038/s41928-019-0257-7\n10.1002/adma.201004692\n10.1002/adma.201504244\n10.7567/JJAP.52.05DA06\n10.1038/s41598-018-26263-1\n10.1038/srep35289\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.12.025\n10.1039/c7cs00278e\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03006\n10.3390/s20030851\n10.1002/advs.201500169\n10.1002/aelm.201900428\n10.1002/adfm.201501695\n10.1002/admt.201800626\n10.1080/10584587.2014.957060\n10.1021/nl400169t\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.11.004\n10.1021/acsami.8b22613\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104706\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111789\n10.1002/adma.201201414\n10.1002/advs.201700107\n10.1109/LED.2019.2954878\n10.1007/s11434-010-3251-y\n10.1063/1.5145037\n10.1038/srep23468\n10.1016/j.matlet.2020.127686\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103923\n10.1039/C9EE01785B\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.09.013\n10.1021/acsami.8b02564\n10.1088/1361-6641/ab6bb0"}

{"title": "Magnetic gas sensing: working principles and recent developments.", "abstract": "Gas sensors work on the principle of transforming the gas adsorption effects on the surface of the active material into a detectable signal in terms of its changed electrical, optical, thermal, mechanical, magnetic (magnetization and spin), and piezoelectric properties. In magnetic gas sensors, the change in the magnetic properties of the active materials is measured by one of the approaches such as Hall effect, magnetization, spin orientation, ferromagnetic resonance, magneto-optical Kerr effect, and magneto-static wave oscillation effect. The disadvantages of different types of gas sensors include their chemical selectivity and sensitivity to humidity and high-temperature operation. For example, in the case of chemiresistive-type gas sensors, the change in the sensor resistance can drastically vary in the real environment due to the presence of other gas species and the overall electrical effect is quite complex due to simultaneous surface reactions. Further, it is not easy to make stable contacts for powdered samples for the conventional electrical property-based gas sensors. Fire hazard is another issue for the electrical property-based hydrogen gas sensors due to their flammable nature at higher operating temperature.

When the lower third molar is located below the lower alveolar canal or when it is close to the lower edge of the jaw, the most recommended approach is the extraoral one. The critical issues related to the extraoral approach are the possibility of damaging anatomical structures such as marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve (craniofacial nerve VII), facial artery and vein, and submental artery.

{"title": "Coalescence of Droplets in a Microwell Driven by Surface Acoustic Waves.", "abstract": "Microwell arrays are amongst the most commonly used platforms for biochemical assays. However, the coalescence of droplets that constitute the dispersed phase of suspensions housed within microwells has not received much attention to date. Herein, we study the coalescence of droplets in a two-phase system in a microwell driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The microwell structure, together with symmetric exposure to SAW irradiation, coupled from beneath the microwell via a piezoelectric substrate, gives rise to the formation of a pair of counter-rotating vortices that enable droplet transport, trapping, and coalescence. We elucidate the physics of the coalescence phenomenon using a scaling analysis of the relevant forces, namely, the acoustic streaming-induced drag force, the capillary and viscous forces associated with the drainage of the thin continuous phase film between the droplets and the van der Waals attraction force. We confirm that droplet-droplet interface contact is established through the formation of a liquid bridge, whose neck radius grows linearly in time in the preceding viscous regime and proportionally with the square root of time in the subsequent inertial regime. Further, we investigate the influence of the input SAW power and droplet size on the film drainage time and demarcate the coalescence and non-coalescence regimes to derive a criterion for the onset of coalescence. The distinct deformation patterns observed for a pair of contacting droplets in both the regimes are elucidated and the possibility for driving concurrent coalescence of multiple droplets is demonstrated. We expect the study will find relevance in the demulsification of immiscible phases and the mixing of samples/reagents within microwells for a variety of biochemical applications.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2021-01-23", "authors": ["ASudeepthi", "ANath", "L YYeo", "A KSen"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c03292"}

{"title": "A Self-Powered Hybrid SSHI Circuit with a Wide Operation Range for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "This paper presents a piezoelectric (PE) energy harvesting circuit, which integrates a Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) circuit and a diode bridge rectifier. A typical SSHI circuit cannot transfer the power from a PE cantilever into the load when the rectified voltage is higher than a certain voltage. The proposed circuit addresses this problem. It uses the two resonant loops for flipping the capacitor voltage and energy transfer in each half cycle. One resonant loop is typically used for the parallel SSHI scheme, and the other for the series SSHI scheme. The hybrid SSHI circuit using the two resonant loops enables the proposed circuit's output voltage to no longer be limited.

{"title": "The Radial Electric Field Excited Circular Disk Piezoceramic Acoustic Resonator and Its Properties.", "abstract": "A new type of piezoceramic acoustic resonator in the form of a circular disk with a radial exciting electric field is presented. The advantage of this type of resonator is the localization of the electrodes at one end of the disk, which leaves the second end free for the contact of the piezoelectric material with the surrounding medium. This makes it possible to use such a resonator as a sensor base for analyzing the properties of this medium. The problem of exciting such a resonator by an electric field of a given frequency is solved using a two-dimensional finite element method. The method for solving the inverse problem for determining the characteristics of a piezomaterial from the broadband frequency dependence of the electrical impedance of a single resonator is proposed. The acoustic and electric field inside the resonator is calculated, and it is shown that this location of electrodes makes it possible to excite radial, flexural, and thickness extensional modes of disk oscillations. The dependences of the frequencies of parallel and series resonances, the quality factor, and the electromechanical coupling coefficient on the size of the electrodes and the gap between them are calculated.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-01-23", "authors": ["AndreyTeplykh", "BorisZaitsev", "AlexanderSemyonov", "IrinaBorodina"], "doi": "10.3390/s21020608\n10.1007/978-3-319-42481-1\n10.3390/s20010290\n10.1016/j.joule.2017.09.004\n10.3390/s20123512\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1367475\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.07.009\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.10.016\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.09.016\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8925788\n10.1063/1.2356859\n10.3390/ma12162502\n10.1051/itmconf/20193007002\n10.1080/17436753.2018.1458475\n10.3390/computation6040060\n10.1007/s10825-012-0399-6\n10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308\n10.3390/ma9020071\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1751\n10.1088/0022-3735/22/10/001\n10.3390/s20154165\n10.1109/IEEESTD.1988.79638"}
{"title": "Vibration Suppression of a Composite Prosthetic Foot Using Piezoelectric Shunt Damping: Implications to Vibration-Induced Cumulative Trauma.", "abstract": "Energy-storage-and-return (ESAR) prosthetic feet have improved amputee mobility due to their efficient conversion of strain energy to mechanical work. However, this efficiency is typically achieved using light-weight, high-stiffness materials, which generate high-frequency vibrations that are potentially injurious if transmitted to biological tissues. To reduce the vibration which may cause cumulative tissue trauma, high-frequency vibration suppression by piezoelectric shunt damping patches on a commercial ESAR foot was evaluated.\nTwo patches with either passive or active shunt circuits were placed on the foot to investigate vibration suppression during experimental tests where a plastic hammer was used to hit a clamped ESAR foot on the free end. Prosthesis bending moments at each modal frequency were obtained by finite element methods to identify piezoelectric patch placement.\nBoth shunt circuits decreased vibration amplitudes at specific modes better than the no shunt case, but also increased the amplitude at specific frequencies. The vibration suppression performance of the active shunt circuit deteriorated at the second mode, while the vibration suppression performance of the passive shunt circuit deteriorated at all frequencies above the third mode.\nThese results indicate piezoelectric shunt patches may be a viable strategy for decreasing vibrations of an ESAR foot, with active methods more efficient at suppressing high-frequency vibrations. Additional research is necessary to fine-tune the method for maximal vibration suppression.\nOverall, this study indicates that high-frequency vibration suppression is possible using piezoelectric patches, possibly decreasing the cumulative tissue damage that may occur with repetitive exposure to vibration.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2021-01-22", "authors": ["Jenna KBurnett", "Young TChoi", "HuaLi", "Norman MWereley", "Ross HMiller", "Jae KunShim"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2021.3053374"}

Herein, a 3D printing technique was employed to fabricate a fully printed, flexible self-powered sensor with high piezoelectric performance. This printing technique is based on the hydrophobic surface-functionalized barium titanate (FD-BTO)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite film. To strengthen the interface bond between BTO and PVDF, the BTO nanoparticles were surface functionalized using hydrophobic 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES). As a result, there was an increase in the content of the \u03b2-phase in the PFDTES modified BTO (FD-BTO) nanoparticle composite film. The 3D-printed self-powered sensor based on the optimum FD-BTO/PVDF composite film exhibited excellent sensitivity (61.6 mV kPa-1) with a piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 69.1 pC/N, which is two-fold higher than that of the unfunctionalized BTO/PVDF counterpart. Additionally, the power sensor displayed excellent mechanical durability in the 20\u2009000 cyclic force tests. In practice, the printed devices were used as a sports wearable device to monitor and analyze athlete motion, and a self-powered printed sensor array (5 \u00d7 5), which could effectively detect the pattern image of the external pressure input.

Patients were distributed randomly into three groups (group I treated by piezoelectric RST and immediate implant insertion, augmented by the nHA bone graft only; group II treated by piezoelectric RST augmented by nHA bone graft and covered by AM; while group III was treated by piezoelectric RST augmented with PRF and nHA graft and covered by AM). Patients were evaluated clinically to assess the implant stability quotient (ISQ) and radiographically to assess horizontal ridge dimension, crestal bone level (CBL), and bone densitometric (BD) parameters.\nISQ results showed a non-significant clinical difference between groups while CBL values showed a high statistically significant difference over the 12-month interval when comparing groups III and II with group I. BD outcomes showed statistically significant differences at all intervals in comparisons of group III with groups I and II.\nThe results of this study suggest that concomitant use of PRF with nHA graft covered with AM for augmentation around the dental implant in a narrow posterior mandible after piezoelectric alveolar ridge splitting accelerate osseointegration and significantly increase bone density around the osseointegrated implant and decrease bone resorption in comparison to that achieved with the graft alone.", "journal": "The Saudi dental journal", "date": "2021-01-22", "authors": ["AlaaAbdelqader Altaweel", "AbdelAziz Baiomy Abdullah Baiomy", "ShadiaAbdel-Hameed Elsayed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.sdentj.2019.11.008\n10.1097/01.omx.0000515465.79426.e0\n10.1016/S0020-1383(16)47010-5\n10.1016/J.BJOMS.2008.11.012\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2005.07.009\n10.1080/08977190802636713\n10.1111/j.1600-051X.2008.01269.x\n10.1097/01.omx.0000444061.56326.e8\n10.1016/S0022-3913(08)60070-0\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2010.02127.x\n10.1093/gerona/62.7.707\n10.1016/S0301-2115(00)00345-6\n10.1111/cid.12146\n10.1002/jbm.a.32452\n10.1016/J.JCMS.2011.04.020"}

Sixty-three patients (44 males, 19 females) who presented with bilaterally asymptomatic impacted mandibular third molars were included in this analysis. Each patient was treated, at two separate sessions approximately 4\u00a0weeks apart, with a conventional rotatory hand piece on one side of the mandible and a piezoelectric device on the contralateral side.

This research proposes an embedded ultrasound system to monitor implant fixation and temperature - a potential indicator of infection. Requiring only two implanted components: a piezoelectric transducer and a coil, pulse-echo responses are elicited via a three-coil inductive link. This passive system avoids the need for batteries, energy harvesters, and microprocessors, resulting in minimal changes to existing implant architecture. Proof-of-concept was demonstrated in vitro for a titanium plate cemented into synthetic bone, using a small embedded coil with 10 mm diameter. Gross loosening - simulated by completely debonding the implant-cement interface - was detectable with 95% confidence at up to 12 mm implantation depth. Temperature was calibrated with root mean square error of 0.19\u00b0C at 5 mm, with measurements accurate to \u00b11\u00b0C with 95% confidence up to 6\u00a0mm implantation depth. These data demonstrate that with only a transducer and coil implanted, it is possible to measure fixation and temperature simultaneously.

Multiple all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of Piezo1 further reveal that this tension-independent flattening is accompanied by gating motions that open an activation gate in the pore.

{"title": "Impact of the central frequency of environment on non-Markovian dynamics in piezoelectric optomechanical devices.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric optomechanical devices supply a promising experimental platform to realize the coherent and effective control and measurement of optical circuits working in Terahertz (THz) frequencies via superconducting electron devices typically working in Radio (MHz) frequencies. However, quantum fluctuations are unavoidable when the size of mechanical oscillators enter into the nanoscale. The consequences of the noisy environment are still challenging due to the lack of analytical tools. In this paper, a semi-classical and full-quantum model of piezoelectric optomechanical systems coupled to a noisy bosonic quantum environment are introduced and solved in terms of quantum-state diffusion (QSD) trajectories in the non-Markovian regime. We show that the noisy environment, particularly the central frequency of the environment, can enhance the entanglement generation between optical cavities and LC circuits in some parameter regimes.

{"title": "Study of Piezoresistive Behavior of Smart Cement Filled with Graphene Oxide.", "abstract": "A cement-based piezoelectric composite, modified by graphene oxide (GO), was prepared to study piezoresistive capacity. The testing confirms that GO is more effective than other carbon nanomaterials at improving piezoresistive sensitivity of cement-based composites, because the content of GO in cement paste was much lower than other carbon nanomaterials used in previously published research. Further investigation indicates that the addition of GO significantly improved the stability and repeatability for piezoresistive capacity of cement paste under cycle loads. Based on experiment results, the piezoresistive sensitivity of this composite depended on GO content, water-to-cement weight ratio (w/c) and water-loss rate, since the highest piezoresistive gauge factor value (GF = 35) was obtained when GO content was 0.05 wt.%, w/c was 0.35 and water-loss rate was 3%.

{"title": "Modeling and Compensation for Asymmetrical and Dynamic Hysteresis of Piezoelectric Actuators Using a Dynamic Delay Prandtl-Ishlinskii Model.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in micro- and nano-manufacturing and precision machining due to their superior performance. However, there are complex hysteresis nonlinear phenomena in piezoelectric actuators. In particular, the inherent hysteresis can be affected by the input frequency, and it sometimes exhibits asymmetrical characteristic. The existing dynamic hysteresis model is inaccurate in describing hysteresis of piezoelectric actuators at high frequency. In this paper, a Dynamic Delay Prandtl-Ishlinskii (DDPI) model is proposed to describe the asymmetrical and dynamic characteristics of piezoelectric actuators. First, the shape of the Delay Play operator is discussed under two delay coefficients. Then, the accuracy of the DDPI model is verified by experiments. Next, to compensate the asymmetrical and dynamic hysteresis, the compensator is designed based on the Inverse Dynamic Delay Prandtl-Ishlinskii (IDDPI) model. The effectiveness of the inverse compensator was verified by experiments. The results show that the DDPI model can accurately describe the asymmetrical and dynamic hysteresis, and the compensator can effectively suppress the hysteresis of the piezoelectric actuator.

{"title": "Sensors for Structural Health Monitoring of Agricultural Structures.", "abstract": "The health diagnosis of agricultural structures is critical to detecting damages such as cracks in concrete, corrosion, spalling, and delamination. Agricultural structures are susceptible to environmental degradation due to frequent exposure to water, organic effluent, farm chemicals, structural loading, and unloading. Various sensors have been employed for accurate and real-time monitoring of agricultural building structures, including electrochemical, ultrasonic, fiber-optic, piezoelectric, wireless, fiber Bragg grating sensors, and self-sensing concrete. The cost-benefits of each type of sensor and utility in a farm environment are explored in the review. Current literature suggests that the functionality of sensors has improved with progress in technology. Notable improvements made with the progress in technology include better accuracy of the measurements, reduction of signal-to-noise ratio, and transmission speed, and the deployment of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence in smart IoT-based agriculture. Key challenges include inconsistent installation of sensors in farm structures, technical constraints, and lack of support infrastructure, awareness, and preference for traditional inspection methods.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-01-21", "authors": ["ChrysanthosMaraveas", "ThomasBartzanas"], "doi": "10.3390/s21010314\n10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2009.06.009\n10.3390/app7111157\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2004.03.008\n10.3390/app10030990\n10.3390/app10113938\n10.1016/j.inpa.2018.08.005\n10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000812\n10.1108/ijbpa-12-2019-0111\n10.3390/su11216129\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.02.081\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.172\n10.1109/JLT.2011.2106479\n10.1016/j.watres.2019.06.062\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128144\n10.1016/j.asej.2012.04.011\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2015.10.012\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2005.09.018\n10.1155/2016/8658290\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/4/008\n10.1109/i2mtc.2019.8827067\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.815\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/020\n10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2017.11.001\n10.1016/0950-0618(95)00060-7\n10.1155/2014/919078\n10.1016/j.cscm.2017.04.002\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.04.004\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.10.036\n10.3390/app10010319\n10.1111/mice.12517\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000572\n10.1007/978-3-319-47952-1_28\n10.1016/j.prostr.2017.07.027\n10.1016/j.prostr.2020.04.043\n10.1145/3311950\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2015.07.058\n10.1057/palgrave.jba.2950045\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.792.195\n10.1007/s00226-012-0514-7\n10.17159/sajs.2015/20140001\n10.1016/j.culher.2014.09.010\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.158\n10.1039/C5AN02208H\n10.1007/s00226-012-0485-8\n10.1177/0075424202026002098\n10.1016/j.acme.2017.09.008\n10.1177/1475921717750047\n10.1080/09613218.2019.1681253\n10.1007/s11709-016-0336-z\n10.1155/2014/543090\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.011\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.06.035\n10.1177/1475921719854528\n10.1088/1755-1315/357/1/012015\n10.3390/s19183879\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.09.015\n10.1080/01694243.2014.998001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0162315\n10.1016/j.corsci.2008.08.040\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2006.10.013\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002384\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.118528\n10.1016/j.ces.2008.08.035\n10.1016/j.electacta.2010.08.089\n10.1002/ceat.201700440\n10.1109/icicict46008.2019.8993257\n10.5703/1288284315429\n10.29354/diag/100448\n10.1177/0954406220921196\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.11.170\n10.1016/j.matpr.2019.06.133\n10.1061/9780784482018.067\n10.1088/1742-6596/1425/1/012207\n10.1680/macr.1960.12.34.40\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2015.02.006\n10.1088/2631-8695/ab90c7\n10.1117/12.207744\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2005.03.007\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.12.087\n10.1016/j.prostr.2019.08.097\n10.1016/j.culher.2003.01.001\n10.1007/s00107-013-0709-0\n10.1016/j.acme.2018.12.007\n10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.133\n10.1016/j.matpr.2019.12.071\n10.1016/j.proeng.2014.11.685\n10.1109/JIOT.2019.2901796\n10.1109/mesa.2008.4735744\n10.1080/13573322.2014.956714\n10.1002/stc.1654\n10.1063/1.5128242\n10.3390/ma3042196\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/009\n10.1016/b978-0-12-814391-9.00001-7"}

{"title": "Precise experimental determination of electrical equivalent circuit parameters for ultrasonic piezoelectric ceramic transducers from their measured characteristics.", "abstract": "The letter is devoted to a method for determining electric equivalent circuit parameters of piezoelectric ceramic transducers from their resonance characteristics. These parameters represent equivalents of mechanical damping, effective weight of the oscillating element, compliance of the mechanical element and static capacitance associated with the transducer material. This method is considered cost efficient, focuses on transducers commonly available on the market and is presented on a specific transducer - transmitter. The acquired parameters are important for performing subsequent simulations and defining their suitability for a particular application. However, these parameters are not included in the usual technical documentation of the commercially available piezoelectric ceramic transducers. The key part of this letter is an iterative process of finding the parameters. Before starting the iteration process, it is very important to set default values of these parameters. Then, a linearized system of equations, based on expressing a real part of the impedance, is used to determine these parameters. The advantage of this method is its simplicity to measure only the two above-mentioned characteristics, from which the required parameters can be then calculated. Thus, there is no need for expensive circuit analyzers, which are able to determine these parameters directly. Although the iterative process includes a large number of steps, and therefore can be relatively time consuming, it can be performed on a commercially available computer technology.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2021-01-20", "authors": ["P\u0159emyslJan\u016f", "JosefBajer", "PavelDy\u010dka", "RadekByst\u0159ick\u00fd"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106341"}
{"title": "Hydroxylated BiFeO", "abstract": "Here we report the effect of surface hydroxylation of BiFeO3 fillers on the dielectric, ferroelectric, energy storage and mechanical energy harvesting performance of poly(vinylidene fluoride). Surface hydroxylation helped to improve the interfacial interaction between the filler and PVDF matrix by introducing a strong hydrogen bonding between the -OH group of the hydroxylated BiFeO3 filler surface and the -CF2 dipole of PVDF in place of electrostatic interfacial interaction between non-hydroxylated BiFeO3 and the -CH2 dipole of PVDF. The amount of polar phase increased to around 91% for a 7 wt% hydroxylated BiFeO3 loaded PVDF film (7BFOH) by this new type of interfacial interaction. The dielectric, ferroelectric, energy storage and mechanical energy harvesting performance of the PVDF based composite films also improved by the above said technique. Upon repeated human finger tapping, the 7BFOH film delivered \u223c18 V output peak to peak open circuit ac voltage (VOC). After rectification, the VOC of the 7BFOH film was able to charge a 10 \u03bcF capacitor up to \u223c3 V which was able to light up some LEDs (connected in parallel) together instantaneously, which proved the real life applicability of the composite films in low power consuming self-powered electronic devices.", "journal": "Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "date": "2021-01-20", "authors": ["AbhishekSasmal", "AniketPatra", "P SujathaDevi", "ShrabaneeSen"], "doi": "10.1039/d0dt04017g"}

However, more frequently than not a range of processing routes and/or additives have been used to enhance such properties. In this study, PVDF nanofibers were electrospun from PVDF solution that contained tetra-n-butyl ammonium chloride (TBAC) at different loadings (1, 2, 3, and 5 wt%). The effect of TBAC on the morphology, crystallinity, and polymorphism of PVDF was studied using various characterization techniques. Addition of TBAC significantly improved the electroactive \u03b2-phase of PVDF. The highest \u03b2-phase content of 89% was attained at a TBAC loading of 3 wt%. Consequently, the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the PVDF nanofibers improved significantly. A nanogenerator fabricated using 3 wt% TBAC/PVDF nanofibers exhibited the maximum voltage output of 17.2 V (under 5 N force) and the maximum power density of \u223c1.4 \u03bcW cm-2 (under 3 N force).

However, achieving a sufficiently high spatial resolution to target small animal sub-regions is still challenging, especially in the axial direction.\nTo achieve high axial resolution, we designed a dual-crossed transducer system that achieved high spatial resolution in the axial direction without complex microfabrication, beamforming circuitry, and signal processing.\nHigh axial resolution was achieved by crossing two ultrasound beams of commercially available piezoelectric curved transducers at the focal length of each transducer.

{"title": "Biosensors for rapid detection of Salmonella in food: A review.", "abstract": "Salmonella is one of the main causes of foodborne infectious diseases, posing a serious threat to public health. It can enter the food supply chain at various stages of production, processing, distribution, and marketing. High prevalence of Salmonella necessitates efficient and effective approaches for its identification, detection, and monitoring at an early stage. Because conventional methods based on plate counting and real-time polymerase chain reaction are time-consuming and laborious, novel rapid detection methods are urgently needed for in-field and on-line applications. Biosensors provide many advantages over conventional laboratory assays in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and show superiority in rapid response and potential portability. They are now recognized as promising alternative tools and one of the most on-site applicable and end user-accessible methods for rapid detection. In recent years, we have witnessed a flourishing of studies in the development of robust and elaborate biosensors for detection of Salmonella in food. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on Salmonella biosensors by highlighting different signal-transducing mechanisms (optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric, etc.) and critically analyzing its recent trends, particularly in combination with nanomaterials, microfluidics, portable instruments, and smartphones.

Although its incidence rate has fallen since 2010, this ratio dramatically stalled between 2014 and 2018. New fast and optimized tools in vaccine analysis and seroconversion testing are critically needed. We developed a clinical diagnostic device based on piezo-actuated nanoresonators that perform as quantitative in situ calibrated nano-bio sensors for specific detection of multiple target molecules in serum samples. The immunoassay successfully diagnoses humoral immune responses induced by malaria vaccine candidates and reveals the timeline and stage of the infection. We applied the newly developed strategy to a variety of different samples, from pure antibody/vaccine solutions, to blood samples from clinical trials on both na\u00efve and pre-exposed malaria volunteers from sub-Saharan countries. Our nanomechanical assay provides a direct one-step label-free quantitative immunoassay that is on par with the gold-standard, multi-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We achieve a limit of detection of few pg ml-1, or sub-pM concentrations. The 6 \u03bcl sample volume allows more than 50 experiments from one finger prick. Furthermore, we simultaneously detected multiple analytes by differential functionalization of multiple sensors in parallel. The inherent differential read-out with in situ controls reduces false positive results. Due to the faster turnaround time, the minimal volume required and the automatized handling system, this technique has great potential for miniaturization and routine diagnostics in pandemic emergencies.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2021-01-14", "authors": ["GiulioBrunetti", "FrancescoPadovani", "AnnalisaDe Pastina", "ChiaraRotella", "AmyMonahan", "Stephen LHoffman", "Said AJongo", "SalimAbdulla", "GiampietroCorradin", "GerdPluschke", "ClaudiaDaubenberger", "MartinHegner"], "doi": "10.1039/d0nr08083g"}

{"title": "Fouling Behavior during Sterile Filtration of Different Glycoconjugate Serotypes Used in Conjugate Vaccines.", "abstract": "Sterile filtration can be a particular challenge when processing very large glycoconjugate vaccines. The objective of this study was to examine the sterile filtration performance of a series of glycoconjugate vaccines produced by coupling different polysaccharide serotypes to an immunogenic protein.\nSterile filtration was performed at constant filtrate flux using 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm pore size Durapore\u00ae polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Glycoconjugates were characterized by dynamic light scattering, rheological measurements, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Confocal microscopy was used to examine glycoconjugate capture profiles within the membrane. Transmembrane pressure data were analyzed using a recently developed fouling model.\nAll glycoconjugates deposited in a narrow band near the entrance of the Durapore\u00ae membranes. The rate of fouling varied significantly for the different serotypes, with the fouling parameter correlated with the fraction of glycoconjugates larger than 200\u00a0nm in size.\nThe fouling behavior and sterile filter capacity of the different glycoconjugate serotypes are determined primarily by the presence of large species (>200\u00a0nm in size) as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis.

{"title": "Preliminary indoor evidences of microplastic effects on freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates.", "abstract": "Plastics are to date considered one of the main detrimental drivers for the health of aquatic ecosystems, both in marine and inland waters. Regarding the latter habitat, it seems surprising how the plastic effects on benthic invertebrates are neglected since macroinvertebrates have a long tradition in the water quality assessment activities. In this context, we propose timely indoor observations on the exposure of caddisfly Odontocerum albicorne and mayfly Ephemera danica to various microplastic polymers (ABS, PET, PP, PS, PVDF). Three different experimental designs were performed on caddisflies and mayflies by exposing their larvae to natural and microplastic substrates. Our findings highlighted how microplastics affected both caddisflies in rebuilding its own case (after having removed the natural one) and mayflies burrowing. Particularly, all caddisflies rebuilt cases using the microplastic polymers provided instead of natural items only. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that mayflies burrow mainly in microplastic substrates rather than in natural ones. Our research highlights that macroinvertebrate larvae would use naturally occurring microplastics and this could be of particular concern in freshwaters with high contamination by plastics. Indeed, larvae appear to not necessarily perceive microplastics as a direct stressor. Further studies ought to be conducted to understand the chronic perturbation on larvae fitness and for example, on drift behaviour. Also, further investigations are needed to understand the potentialities of using plastics by benthic macroinvertebrates.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2021-01-14", "authors": ["LucaGallitelli", "AlessandraCera", "GiuliaCesarini", "LorisPietrelli", "MassimilianoScalici"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-80606-5\n10.1038/494169a\n10.1126/science.aad2622\n10.1016/j.watres.2015.09.002\n10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.024\n10.1002/etc.4371\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135578\n10.1111/gcb.14572\n10.1016/j.watres.2018.06.015\n10.3390/d12070276\n10.1126/science.1260352\n10.1038/ncomms15611\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.207\n10.1021/es400931b\n10.1016/j.envpol.2011.08.052\n10.1016/j.envint.2019.104937\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.190\n10.1071/EN14143\n10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.050\n10.1016/j.envint.2018.11.061\n10.1007/s11356-011-0655-5\n10.1016/j.ecss.2013.06.016\n10.1021/es405721v\n10.1021/es401288x\n10.1016/j.watres.2020.116429\n10.1016/j.envpol.2018.10.088\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113348\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134535\n10.1071/EN14218\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.158\n10.1139/cjfas-2018-0388\n10.1007/s11356-020-07954-7\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113865\n10.1002/lol2.10138\n10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.075\n10.1016/j.limno.2019.125708\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134192\n10.1007/s11356-018-3609-3\n10.1021/acs.est.7b03567\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.298\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.271\n10.1016/j.envpol.2015.06.009\n10.1021/acs.est.6b00183\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.103\n10.1016/j.envpol.2016.10.037\n10.1371/journal.pone.0187590\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113233\n10.1139/f80-017\n10.3390/w10111597\n10.3354/ab00711\n10.1021/acs.est.7b05367\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113898\n10.1007/s11356-020-08790-5\n10.1016/j.envpol.2015.09.018\n10.2307/3543295\n10.1080/01650420902812222\n10.1007/s11356-017-9621-1\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.017\n10.1016/j.trac.2018.10.025"}

J Endourol 2015;29(2):210-5.). The short-term follow-up of this international multicenter study carried out now is presented in this article.\nEleven clinics and 13 surgeons in four European counties participated in the trial. In order to ensure a standardized approach and obtain comparable data, all surgeons were obliged to follow a standardized approach for pectopexy, focusing on the area of fixation and the use of a prefabricated mesh (PVDF PRP 3 \u00d7 15 Dynamesh). The mesh was solely used for apical repair. All other clinically relevant defects were treated with native tissue repair. Colposuspension or TVT were used for the treatment of incontinence. Data were collected independently for 14 months on a secured server; 501 surgeries were registered and evaluated. Two hundred and sixty-four patients out of 479 (55.1%) returned for the physical examination and interview after 12-18 months.\nThe mean duration of follow-up was 15 months. The overall success of apical repair was rated positively by 96.9%, and the satisfaction score was rated positively by 95.5%. A positive general recommendation was expressed by 95.1% of patients. Pelvic pressure was reduced in 95.2%, pain in 98.0%, and urgency in 86.0% of patients. No major complications, mesh exposure, or mesh complication occurred during the follow-up period.\nIn clinical routine, pectopexy and concomitant surgery, mainly using native tissue approaches, resulted in high satisfaction rates and favorable clinical findings. The procedure may also be recommended for use by general urogynecological practitioners with experience in laparoscopy.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2021-01-14", "authors": ["G\u00fcnter KNo\u00e9", "SvenSchiermeier", "ThomasPapathemelis", "UlrichFuellers", "AlexanderKhudyakovd", "Harald-HansAltmann", "StefanBorowski", "Pawel PMorawski", "MarkusGantert", "BartDe Vree", "ZbigniewTkacz", "Rodrigo GilUgarteburu", "MichaelAnapolski"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm10020217\n10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181b2b1ae\n10.1007/s00192-018-3755-7\n10.1080/13645706.2018.1510420\n10.1007/s00404-010-1687-7\n10.1097/00006250-196207000-00009\n10.1097/01.AOG.0000139514.90897.07\n10.1016/j.jmig.2007.06.017\n10.1007/s00192-016-3179-1\n10.1002/uog.15882\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2019.10.022\n10.1089/end.2014.0413\n10.1002/nau.20542\n10.1007/s00192-008-0657-0\n10.1007/s00192-011-1361-z\n10.1007/s00192-011-1542-9\n10.1016/j.jogoh.2019.07.006\n10.1080/21681163.2019.1670095\n10.1007/s00192-017-3296-5\n10.1007/s00192-014-2369-y\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2017.11.018\n10.1007/s11255-019-02124-2\n10.1097/MOU.0000000000000395\n10.1155/2012/538426\n10.1089/end.2018.0474\n10.1007/s00192-019-03874-4\n10.1155/2019/9051963\n10.1016/j.ajog.2007.02.045\n10.1016/j.purol.2010.12.003\n10.1056/NEJMoa070416\n10.1001/jama.2013.4919\n10.1007/s00192-019-04041-5\n10.1007/s00192-020-04396-0\n10.1007/s00192-020-04374-6"}
{"title": "Metal-Organic Frameworks: Synthetic Methods and Potential Applications.", "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks represent a porous class of materials that are build up from metal ions or oligonuclear metallic complexes and organic ligands. They can be considered as sub-class of coordination polymers and can be extended into one-dimension, two-dimensions, and three-dimensions. Depending on the size of the pores, MOFs are divided into nanoporous, mesoporous, and macroporous items. The latter two are usually amorphous. MOFs display high porosity, a large specific surface area, and high thermal stability due to the presence of coordination bonds. The pores can incorporate neutral molecules, such as solvent molecules, anions, and cations, depending on the overall charge of the MOF, gas molecules, and biomolecules. The structural diversity of the framework and the multifunctionality of the pores render this class of materials as candidates for a plethora of environmental and biomedical applications and also as catalysts, sensors, piezo/ferroelectric, thermoelectric, and magnetic materials. In the present review, the synthetic methods reported in the literature for preparing MOFs and their derived materials, and their potential applications in environment, energy, and biomedicine are

However, current energy harvesting technologies that directly interact with internal organs often lack flexibility and conformability, and they usually require additional implantation surgeries that impose extra burden to patients. To address this issue, here a Kirigami inspired energy harvester, seamlessly incorporated into the pacemaker lead using piezoelectric composite films is reported, which not only possesses great flexibility but also requires no additional implantation surgeries. This lead-based device allows for harvesting energy from the complex motion of the lead caused by the expansion-contraction of the heart. The device's Kirigami pattern has been designed and optimized to attain greatly improved flexibility which is validated via finite element method (FEM) simulations, mechanical tensile tests, and energy output tests where the device shows a power output of 2.4\u00a0\u00b5W. Finally, an in vivo test using a porcine model reveals that the device can be implanted into the heart straightforwardly and generates voltages up to \u22480.7\u00a0V. This work offers a new strategy for designing flexible energy harvesters that power implantable electronics.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2021-01-13", "authors": ["ZheXu", "CongranJin", "AndrewCabe", "DannyEscobedo", "AleksandraGruslova", "ScottJenney", "Andrew BClosson", "LinDong", "ZiChen", "Marc DFeldman", "John X JZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202002100"}

However, the inevitable safety issues always caused by poor mechanical integrity and internal short circuits of the thin separator must be addressed before this type of separator can be applied to lithium-ion batteries. Here, we developed a novel multilayer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) membrane with a highly porous and lamellar structure, through a combination of evaporation-induced phase separation and selective solvent etching methods. The developed membrane is capable of a greater amount of electrolyte uptake and excellent electrolyte retention resulting from its superior electrolyte wettability and highly porous structure, thereby offering better electrochemical performance compared to that of a commercial polyolefin separator (Celgard). Moreover, benefiting from the layered configuration, the tensile strength of the membrane can reach 13.5 MPa, which is close to the mechanical strength of the Celgard type along the transversal direction. The elaborate design of the multilayered structure allows the fabrication of a new class of thin separators with significant improvements in the mechanical and electrochemical performance.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Sensor-Embedded Smart Rock for Damage Monitoring in a Prestressed Anchorage Zone.", "abstract": "In this paper, a piezoelectric sensor-embedded smart rock is proposed for the electromechanical impedance monitoring of internal concrete damage in a prestressed anchorage zone. Firstly, a piezoelectric sensor-embedded smart rock is analyzed for impedance monitoring in concrete structures. An impedance measurement model is analyzed for the PZT (lead zirconate titanate)-embedded smart rock under compression in a concrete member. Secondly, a prototype of the smart rock embedded with a PZT sensor is designed in order to ascertain, sensitively, the variations of the impedance signatures induced by concrete damage in an anchorage zone. Thirdly, the performance of the smart rock is estimated from a numerical analysis and experimental tests. Variations in the impedance signals under compressive test cases are analyzed in order to predetermine the sensitive frequency band for the impedance monitoring. Lastly, an experiment on an anchorage zone embedded with the smart rocks and surface-mounted PZT sensors is conducted for the impedance measurement under a series of loading cases. The impedance variations are quantified in order to comparatively evaluate the feasibility of the sensor-embedded smart rock for the detection of internal concrete damage in the anchorage zone. The results show that the internal concrete damage was successfully detected using the PZT-embedded smart rock, thus enabling the application of the technique for anchorage zone health monitoring.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-01-13", "authors": ["Quang-QuangPham", "Ngoc-LoiDang", "Jeong-TaeKim"], "doi": "10.3390/s21020353\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000061\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.01.033\n10.12989/sss.2014.14.4.719\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2006.07.024\n10.1260/1369-4332.15.6.997\n10.1007/s12205-014-0633-9\n10.3390/s18071981\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.05.029\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111728\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.118114\n10.3390/app7040339\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2009.08.021\n10.3390/s19051054\n10.3390/s8010327\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.06.100\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.046\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.148\n10.3390/s140101208\n10.1002/stc.2173\n10.1177/1475921720917126\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/038\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000939\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/8/085016\n10.3390/app8101833\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.094\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.03.006\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.04.006\n10.12989/sss.2016.17.1.107\n10.1177/1045389X12437888\n10.12989/sss.2013.12.3_4.381\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/5/055001\n10.3390/s20020510\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.04.020\n10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108018\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.2.375\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.03.006\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035008\n10.1177/1045389X20969916\n10.1177/0040517511420767\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab58e9\n10.1177/1045389X04046309\n10.3390/s18092766\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119395"}

Injection of local anaesthetic close to, but not touching, the nerve is key to outcomes, but the exact relationship between the needle tip and nerve epineurium is difficult to evaluate, even with ultrasound. Ultrasound has insufficient resolution, tissues are difficult to discern due to acoustic impedance and needles are more difficult to see with increased angulation. The limitations of ultrasound have shifted the focus of innovation towards bio-markers that help detect needle tip position by utilising the physical properties of tissues, (e.g. pressure, electrical, optics, acoustic and elastic). Although most are at the laboratory stage and results are as yet only available from phantom or cadaver studies, clinical trials are imminent. For example, fine optical fibres placed within the lumen of block needles can measure needle tip pressure. Electrical impedance differentiates between intraneural and perineural needle tip placement. A new tip tracker needle has a piezo element embedded at its distal end that tracks the needle tip in-plane and out-of-plane as a blue/red or green circle depending on its relative location within the beam. Micro-ultrasound at the tip of the needle is in development.

The aim was to compare cross-section methods of upper included third molars by ultrasonic piezoelectric technique to obtain dental pulp, with diamond-coated tip (DT) against titanium nitride-coated tip (TN), according to the pulp tissue cell viability and the section surface characteristics.\nPatients attending dental consultation were evaluated. Upper third molars (n= 24) were avulsed from 15 patients with exodontia indication, age 18-26 years old, who agreed to participate of the study. Third molars were cross-sectioned at amelocemental junction level with piezoelectric device using DT or TN inserts. Pulps were mechanic and enzymatically treated, and tissue viability determined by Trypan Blue test. Sectioned teeth were visualized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Ethical principles of biomedical research were respected; all patients gave their informed consent.\nViability of pulp tissue was 84.71% not associated to sex (p= 0.141) nor to teeth position, upper right third molar or upper left third molar (p= 0.580). According to the insert used, pulp tissue viability was 85.21% with TN, similar to 84.00% with DT (p= 0.611). By SEM, cut performed by TN insert showed smooth and uniform surfaces, while DT insert surfaces were irregular, porous, with fissures.\nPiezosurgery applied to cross-section upper third molars with both types of inserts showed differences in the cut surfaces but similar effectiveness regarding preservation of pulp tissue with high viability, thus, they could be allocated for further cellular developments.

{"title": "A practical microfluidic pump enabled by acoustofluidics and 3D printing.", "abstract": "Simple and low-cost solutions are becoming extremely important for the evolving necessities of biomedical applications. Even though, on-chip sample processing and analysis has been rapidly developing for a wide range of screening and diagnostic protocols, efficient and reliable fluid manipulation in microfluidic platforms still require further developments to be considered portable and accessible for low-resource settings. In this work, we present an extremely simple microfluidic pumping device based on three-dimensional (3D) printing and acoustofluidics. The fabrication of the device only requires 3D-printed adaptors, rectangular glass capillaries, epoxy and a piezoelectric transducer. The pumping mechanism relies on the flexibility and complexity of the acoustic streaming patterns generated inside the capillary. Characterization of the device yields controllable and continuous flow rates suitable for on-chip sample processing and analysis. Overall, a maximum flow rate of ~\u200912\u00a0\u03bcL/min and the control of pumping direction by frequency tuning is achieved. With its versatility and simplicity, this microfluidic pumping device offers a promising solution for portable, affordable and reliable fluid manipulation for on-chip applications.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10404-020-02411-w.", "journal": "Microfluidics and nanofluidics", "date": "2021-01-12", "authors": ["AdemOzcelik", "ZeynepAslan"], "doi": "10.1007/s10404-020-02411-w\n10.3390/mi2020179\n10.1039/C6LC00951D\n10.1039/b707637a\n10.1039/c2lc21068a\n10.1039/b819887j\n10.3390/mi11030300\n10.1063/1.2988313\n10.1007/s10404-014-1380-4\n10.1007/s10404-020-02335-5\n10.1103/RevModPhys.83.647\n10.1007/s10404-020-02334-6\n10.1063/1.4762851\n10.1073/pnas.1422068112\n10.1038/s41378-018-0002-9\n10.1038/s41378-018-0010-9\n10.1002/elps.201700375\n10.1039/C4LC00806E\n10.1007/s10404-008-0266-8\n10.1039/C4LC00500G\n10.1039/C4LC00510D\n10.1039/C4LC00790E\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.114504\n10.1039/C9LC00535H\n10.1039/b601886f\n10.1039/C8LC00001H\n10.1007/s13239-012-0115-5\n10.1016/j.aca.2019.02.004\n10.1039/c9lc00484j\n10.1007/s10404-013-1316-4\n10.1039/c0lc00397b\n10.1063/1.2768631\n10.1039/c4lc00191e\n10.1039/C5LC00231A\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.05.050\n10.1038/537493a\n10.1007/s10544-019-0364-2\n10.1002/smll.201601760\n10.1038/s41592-018-0222-9\n10.3390/bioengineering7010017\n10.3390/mi10110762\n10.1039/C6LC01318J\n10.1016/S0167-9317(02)00518-X\n10.3390/mi9110609\n10.1039/b812435c\n10.1007/s10404-010-0758-1\n10.1021/acsnano.0c02624\n10.1002/elps.201500404\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04481\n10.1063/1.5141871\n10.1007/s10404-008-0399-9\n10.3390/s20061788\n10.1038/s41378-019-0064-3\n10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00069\n10.1007/s10404-008-0356-7\n10.1038/s41598-019-51464-7\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2007.05.003\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.01.189\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112041\n10.1039/b609813d"}

{"title": "Structure, kinetic properties and biological function of mechanosensitive Piezo channels.", "abstract": "Mechanotransduction couples mechanical stimulation with ion flux, which is critical for normal biological processes involved in neuronal cell development, pain sensation, and red blood cell volume regulation. Although they are key mechanotransducers, mechanosensitive ion channels in mammals have remained difficult to identify. In 2010, Coste and colleagues revealed a novel family of mechanically activated cation channels in eukaryotes, consisting of Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels. These have been proposed as the long-sought-after mechanosensitive cation channels in mammals. Piezo1 and Piezo2 exhibit a unique propeller-shaped architecture and have been implicated in mechanotransduction in various critical processes, including touch sensation, balance, and cardiovascular regulation. Furthermore, several mutations in Piezo channels have been shown to cause multiple hereditary human disorders, such as autosomal recessive congenital lymphatic dysplasia. Notably, mutations that cause dehydrated hereditary xerocytosis alter the rate of Piezo channel inactivation, indicating the critical role of their kinetics in normal physiology. Given the importance of Piezo channels in understanding the mechanotransduction process, this review focuses on their structural details, kinetic properties and potential function as mechanosensors. We also briefly review the hereditary diseases caused by mutations in Piezo genes, which is key for understanding the function of these proteins.", "journal": "Cell & bioscience", "date": "2021-01-11", "authors": ["Xiang-ZhiFang", "TingZhou", "Ji-QianXu", "Ya-XinWang", "Miao-MiaoSun", "Ya-JunHe", "Shang-WenPan", "WeiXiong", "Zhe-KangPeng", "Xue-HuiGao", "YouShang"], "doi": "10.1186/s13578-020-00522-z\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-102314-112441\n10.1007/s12551-019-00587-2\n10.1146/annurev.neuro.051508.135531\n10.1016/S0076-6879(99)94027-2\n10.1007/BF01872883\n10.1113/jphysiol.2011.206789\n10.1038/ncb1218\n10.1073/pnas.0606894103\n10.1152/ajprenal.00308.2007\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00143-4\n10.1254/jphs.FP0061332\n10.1152/ajpcell.00367.2006\n10.1016/j.neuron.2010.06.032\n10.1016/j.brainres.2011.11.044\n10.1016/j.neuron.2012.12.035\n10.1038/cr.2008.88\n10.1074/jbc.274.38.26691\n10.1126/science.1213808\n10.1529/biophysj.106.092478\n10.1113/jphysiol.2010.199034\n10.1152/ajpgi.90610.2008\n10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75267-3\n10.1042/BJ20111147\n10.1038/ncb2053\n10.1038/367470a0\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4580-10.2011\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.11.030\n10.1016/j.neuron.2013.06.019\n10.1038/ng.945\n10.1038/nrn2993\n10.1083/jcb.201006074\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-15-06408.2002\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/nature15247\n10.1038/nature25743\n10.7554/eLife.33660\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1038/s41586-019-1505-8\n10.7554/eLife.07370\n10.1038/s41586-019-1485-8\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00258\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422253\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2017.01.001\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.033\n10.1038/ncomms8223\n10.1016/j.str.2014.08.009\n10.1182/blood-2013-02-482489\n10.1038/s41467-017-01712-z\n10.7554/eLife.12088\n10.1038/ncomms10366\n10.1073/pnas.1905985116\n10.1074/jbc.M114.604033\n10.1038/s41586-019-1499-2\n10.7554/eLife.41968\n10.1073/pnas.0600463103\n10.1038/ncomms2899\n10.1007/s10689-016-9870-z\n10.1038/ncomms9085\n10.1038/ncomms9329\n10.1038/ncomms2899\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.015\n10.1073/pnas.1221400110\n10.1002/ajmg.a.36881\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.7554/eLife.44003\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.12.040\n10.7554/eLife.33149\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108225\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.094\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.07.014\n10.1038/ncomms2673\n10.4161/chan.21050\n10.1186/1756-6606-6-57\n10.1038/s41467-019-09055-7\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.035\n10.1073/pnas.1910213116\n10.1038/s41467-018-03570-9\n10.1038/s41467-019-12501-1\n10.1021/bi200770q\n10.1085/jgp.115.5.583\n10.1038/nature02743\n10.1111/bph.14188\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00177\n10.1016/j.isci.2019.10.037\n10.1016/j.tips.2019.10.002\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1073/pnas.1817070115\n10.1038/35025220\n10.1152/ajpcell.00346.2018\n10.1084/jem.20180483\n10.1152/physrev.1995.75.3.519\n10.1007/s11906-010-0118-2\n10.1016/S0165-6147(02)00005-6\n10.1172/JCI87343\n10.1172/JCI123825\n10.1152/ajpheart.00103.2018\n10.1165/rcmb.2018-0197OC\n10.1038/s41467-017-00429-3\n10.1016/B978-0-444-53491-0.00008-0\n10.1152/physrev.1976.56.1.100\n10.1126/science.aau6324\n10.1146/annurev.ph.49.030187.001141\n10.1021/ac0495992\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00977\n10.1073/pnas.1219777110\n10.3324/haematol.2013.086090\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.047\n10.1073/pnas.1507309112\n10.1038/nrn3383\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.04.002\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150045\n10.1038/nn.4394\n10.1002/glia.23722\n10.3389/fnagi.2018.00332\n10.1101/cshperspect.a020479\n10.1016/j.conb.2017.12.005\n10.2174/1871527315666160815164247\n10.1038/nrm3620\n10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155306\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1073/pnas.1412740111\n10.1038/nrgastro.2013.177\n10.1113/JP272718\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.63.1.119\n10.1007/s00441-016-2455-1\n10.1007/s00441-017-2755-0\n10.1038/nrgastro.2012.32\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.177105\n10.1007/s00441-019-03040-8\n10.1093/rb/rbz022\n10.1074/jbc.M400437200\n10.1073/pnas.1414298111\n10.1177/2045894018767393\n10.1073/pnas.1902165116\n10.1165/rcmb.2019-0024OC\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-011110-130158\n10.1186/s12931-019-1083-1\n10.1096/fj.202000613RRR\n10.1159/000244054\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.11.009\n10.1152/ajprenal.00453.2010\n10.1152/ajprenal.00214.2019\n10.1007/s00424-016-1811-z\n10.1038/embor.2013.170\n10.1074/jbc.M113.528638\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.017\n10.1038/nrn2993\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1038/nature10801\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0522-13.2013\n10.1038/nature13250\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9892\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9897\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.056\n10.1016/j.neuron.2016.11.027\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4584-05.2006\n10.3389/fnmol.2019.00178\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2019.02.015\n10.1038/s41374-019-0357-z\n10.1002/path.5553\n10.1007/s00432-020-03179-w\n10.18632/aging.101934\n10.1126/sciimmunol.abb5168"}

{"title": "Lab-on-a-Filter Techniques for Economical, Effective, and Flexible Proteome Analysis.", "abstract": "Effective and reliable protease digestion of biological samples is critical to the success in bottom-up proteomics analysis. Various filter-based approaches using different types of membranes have been developed in the past several years and largely implemented in sample preparations for modern proteomics.

{"title": "Electrospun PVDF Nanofibers for Piezoelectric Applications: A Review of the Influence of Electrospinning Parameters on the \u03b2 Phase and Crystallinity Enhancement.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is among the most attractive piezo-polymers due to its excellent piezoelectricity, lightweight, flexibility, high thermal stability, and chemical resistance. PVDF can exist under different forms of films, membranes, and (nano)fibers, and its piezoelectric property related to its \u03b2 phase content makes it interesting for energy harvesters and wearable applications. Research investigation shows that PVDF in the form of nanofibers prepared by electrospinning has more flexibility and better air permeability, which make them more suitable for these types of applications. Electrospinning is an efficient technique that produces PVDF nanofibers with a high \u03b2 phase fraction and crystallinity by aligning molecular dipoles (-CH2 and -CF2) along an applied voltage direction. Different nanofibers production techniques and more precisely the electrospinning method for producing PVDF nanofibers with optimal electrospinning parameters are the key focuses of this paper. This review article highlights recent studies to summarize the influence of electrospinning parameters such as process (voltage, distance, flow rate, and collector), solution (Mw, concentration, and solvent), and ambient (humidity and temperature) parameters to enhance the piezoelectric properties of PVDF nanofibers. In addition, recent development regarding the effect of adding nanoparticles in the structure of nanofibers on the improvement of the \u03b2 phase is reviewed. Finally, different methods of measuring piezoelectric properties of PVDF nanofibrous membrane are discussed.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2021-01-10", "authors": ["ZhongchenHe", "Fran\u00e7oisRault", "MarylineLewandowski", "ElhamMohsenzadeh", "FabienSala\u00fcn"], "doi": "10.3390/polym13020174\n10.1106/8BFB-GC8P-XQ47-YCQ0\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2020.108100\n10.1155/2018/8164185\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.003\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2014.10.001\n10.1080/00150193.2020.1736921\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070616-124023\n10.1039/C8EE03006E\n10.1016/j.orgel.2018.04.037\n10.1039/C5TC02043C\n10.1039/C6TA09590A\n10.3390/polym10030228\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.03.023\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.03.007\n10.1039/D0RA05675H\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111841\n10.1039/c3ra40732b\n10.1016/S0378-7753(98)00193-1\n10.3390/membranes8030045\n10.1002/pc.25043\n10.1007/s10856-012-4808-y\n10.1088/1748-6041/7/3/035004\n10.1016/j.matlet.2019.126515\n10.1039/c1jm11445j\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.04.182\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106695\n10.3390/nano9070952\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.04.013\n10.1002/mame.201200143\n10.1007/978-1-4419-7853-0\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.06.030\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.03.038\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.04.026\n10.1002/app.34810\n10.1177/1528083720923773\n10.1002/app.49394\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.06.096\n10.1063/1.2372694\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.02.002\n10.1021/ja310849c\n10.1002/mame.201600569\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.12.011\n10.1002/app.43707\n10.1002/chem.200390064\n10.1080/00150193.2018.1456304\n10.1126/science.266.5193.1961\n10.1002/app.48916\n10.1039/c1ee01437d\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab9471\n10.1002/polb.24618\n10.1002/app.42847\n10.1007/s40430-018-1131-7\n10.1002/adfm.201600907\n10.1209/epl/i1998-00233-9\n10.1126/science.1070821\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2007.11.008\n10.1515/polyeng-2015-0022\n10.1007/s12221-019-8519-6\n10.1002/app.31787\n10.1166/jnn.2016.10692\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/095044\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.11.036\n10.1063/1.373532\n10.1021/am1002525\n10.1039/C5RA25671B\n10.1039/C7RA01299C\n10.1039/c3ee24230g\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.12.112\n10.5923/j.textile.20170604.03\n10.1080/1539445X.2019.1582542\n10.1002/marc.200700544\n10.1007/s42114-017-0016-z\n10.3390/polym10090965\n10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00178-7\n10.1016/j.addr.2010.12.002\n10.1088/1748-6041/8/4/045007\n10.1016/j.mseb.2006.03.035\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa7245\n10.1002/app.21762\n10.1002/polb.20737\n10.1007/s40204-017-0071-0\n10.1016/j.cej.2016.08.125\n10.1021/acsami.5b11356\n10.1007/s10854-017-7491-4\n10.1186/s11671-018-2705-0\n10.1080/1539445X.2010.495630\n10.1080/00405000.2017.1377882\n10.3390/s19173739\n10.1021/la7035407\n10.1002/pen.24192\n10.1021/nn100845b\n10.1002/pen.20497\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.05.211\n10.1080/00405000.2016.1202091\n10.1002/mame.201900796\n10.4236/msa.2010.14036\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.08.003\n10.1166/jnn.2016.13750\n10.1002/app.12267\n10.1002/jbm.b.33778\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.07.032\n10.1039/C5RA11441A\n10.3390/nano8060420\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/4/045009\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025003\n10.1007/s10853-015-8986-0\n10.1039/C4RA16360E\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.10.011\n10.3390/ma13061368\n10.1016/j.polymer.2010.04.021\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.050\n10.1088/1757-899X/230/1/012043\n10.1016/j.polymer.2011.03.024\n10.1007/s10853-013-7341-6\n10.1039/c1nr10467e\n10.1002/app.47049\n10.1142/S0219581X09006092\n10.1155/2014/367671\n10.1177/0040517518792748\n10.1088/2053-1591/aad156\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.09.023\n10.1186/1556-276X-9-522\n10.1007/s00339-015-9197-x\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.170\n10.1063/1.4994968\n10.1002/pat.4463\n10.1021/cm060223+\n10.1515/epoly.2008.8.1.1758\n10.1016/j.desal.2009.01.017\n10.1007/978-3-642-36427-3\n10.1039/C8RA09257E\n10.1021/acsami.0c02578\n10.1021/acsami.0c00708\n10.1149/1945-7111/ab77fb\n10.1002/pi.4314\n10.1021/jp4011026\n10.1016/j.desal.2019.05.005\n10.1016/j.jiec.2020.02.016\n10.1117/12.2026758\n10.1007/s10965-015-0765-8\n10.1007/s12588-011-9001-5\n10.1016/j.energy.2020.117385\n10.1007/s10118-020-2428-4\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2008.11.018\n10.1021/am500061v\n10.1002/adma.200400606\n10.1002/pat.4992\n10.1021/la8024183\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2011.05.017\n10.1021/acsomega.8b00237\n10.1109/TIM.2012.2234576\n10.3390/ICEM18-05404\n10.1177/0391398818785049"}

We show that Janus Te2Se monolayer is preferable for SO2 and NOx molecules with suitable adsorption strength and apparent charge transfers. We further calculated the current-voltage (I-V) curves using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. The transport feature exhibits distinct responses with a dramatic change of I-V curves before and after NOx (SO2) adsorption on Janus Te2Se. Thus, we predict that Janus Te2Se could be a promising candidate for SO2 and NOx sensors with high selectivity and sensitivity. Moreover, the effect of strain on the gas/substrate adsorption systems was also studied, implying that the strained Janus Te2Se monolayer could enhance the sensitivity and selectivity to SO2 and NO2. The adsorbed SO2 and NO2 on Janus Te2Se could escape by releasing the applied strain, which indicates that the capture process is reversible.

A major overview of structural defects in composite materials that have an influence on product performance as well as material strength is presented. Particularly, the proposed diagnostic (health monitoring) system enables to monitor the composite material plate defects during the exploitation in real-time. The investigated health monitoring system can indicate the material structure defects when the periodic test input signal is provided to excite the plate. Especially, the diagnostic system is useful when the defect placement is hard to be identified. In this work, several various numerical and experimental studies were carried out. Particularly, during the first study, the piezoelectric transducer was used to produce mechanical excitation to the composite plate when the impact response is measured with another piezoelectric sensor. The second study focuses on the defect identification algorithms of the raw hologram data consisting of the recorded oscillation modes of the affected composite plate. The main paper results obtained in both studies enable us to determine whether the composite material is characterized by mechanical defects occurring during the response to the periodic excitation. In case of damage, the observed response amplitude was decreased by 70%.

{"title": "Scanning and Actuation Techniques for Cantilever-Based Fiber Optic Endoscopic Scanners-A Review.", "abstract": "Endoscopes are used routinely in modern medicine for in-vivo imaging of luminal organs. Technical advances in the micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) and optical fields have enabled the further miniaturization of endoscopes, resulting in the ability to image previously inaccessible small-caliber luminal organs, enabling the early detection of lesions and other abnormalities in these tissues. The development of scanning fiber endoscopes supports the fabrication of small cantilever-based imaging devices without compromising the image resolution. The size of an endoscope is highly dependent on the actuation and scanning method used to illuminate the target image area. Different actuation methods used in the design of small-sized cantilever-based endoscopes are reviewed in this paper along with their working principles, advantages and disadvantages, generated scanning patterns, and applications.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-01-07", "authors": ["MandeepKaur", "Pierre MLane", "CarloMenon"], "doi": "10.3390/s21010251\n10.2147/CEG.S58157\n10.3410/M4-3\n10.3390/app10196865\n10.1364/BOE.9.005159\n10.1016/j.pacs.2020.100211\n10.1186/s12967-019-1802-x\n10.1117/1.1979504\n10.1364/OE.27.017819\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2294679\n10.1364/AO.47.004560\n10.1002/jbio.200900087\n10.1117/12.648030\n10.3390/mi8070210\n10.1186/s40486-016-0036-4\n10.1364/OL.29.002521\n10.1038/nmeth820\n10.1364/OL.43.001906\n10.1117/1.OE.55.8.083105\n10.1364/BOE.9.004649\n10.1109/TBME.2002.803524\n10.1016/S0030-4018(00)01164-0\n10.1117/1.3103583\n10.1117/12.701004\n10.1049/el:19910450\n10.1364/AO.30.002143\n10.1364/OE.11.000120\n10.1038/443765a\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.203901\n10.1364/OE.20.023944\n10.1117/1.3631798\n10.1364/OE.20.010583\n10.7567/APEX.6.052503\n10.1364/OL.44.003841\n10.1364/OPEX.13.005528\n10.1364/OL.29.002408\n10.1364/OE.15.017681\n10.1364/BOE.3.002851\n10.1364/OL.37.000362\n10.1117/1.JBO.25.3.032005\n10.1364/OL.21.000543\n10.1364/OL.29.001763\n10.1364/OL.39.006675\n10.1364/OE.17.013819\n10.1088/1361-6439/aaceb5\n10.1115/1.4040271\n10.1364/BOE.9.002326\n10.1364/OE.15.002445\n10.1364/OL.28.000628\n10.1364/OE.15.018130\n10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2951102\n10.1364/OE.26.004780\n10.1364/OE.24.003903\n10.1364/OE.380690\n10.1364/OE.18.012065\n10.1364/BOE.7.003345\n10.1364/OE.27.016296\n10.1364/OL.26.001966\n10.1016/j.gie.2005.05.021\n10.1364/OL.31.001265\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.5.050502\n10.1117/12.842617\n10.3390/mi10020085\n10.1364/OL.22.001618\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.09.035\n10.1364/OL.21.000764\n10.1364/OE.14.008604\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2834549\n10.1117/1.JNP.12.033007\n10.1109/JMEMS.2013.2295470\n10.1121/1.1913195\n10.1121/1.382597\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.10.019\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.07.001\n10.1364/OL.44.002232\n10.1364/OE.18.021183\n10.1007/s12213-017-0098-2\n10.3390/mi7020024\n10.1117/1.OE.58.2.023101\n10.1073/pnas.1114746108\n10.1038/lsa.2017.82\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa8915\n10.1016/S0924-4247(96)01247-2\n10.1007/s00542-013-1953-2\n10.1016/0924-4247(92)80076-F\n10.1088/0960-1317/9/1/308\n10.1116/1.1468654\n10.1007/s005420050152\n10.1007/s00542-002-0253-z\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00563-X\n10.3390/mi8070203\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/10/020\n10.1109/memsys.2016.7421637\n10.1109/JMEMS.2005.845449\n10.1109/84.925771\n10.1007/s00542-018-4078-9\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/8/085014\n10.3390/mi3030542\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2992371\n10.1088/0960-1317/3/1/002\n10.3390/mi8050146\n10.12928/telkomnika.v14i3.3998\n10.1109/84.623114\n10.1364/BOE.4.001342\n10.1109/dtip.2014.7056688\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/7/075014\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.10.028\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/2/025020\n10.1109/JMEMS.2002.800561\n10.1080/15599610903174440\n10.1364/OL.31.002018\n10.3390/mi3020509\n10.3390/mi8080240\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00529-X\n10.1364/OL.33.000657\n10.1541/ieejsmas.120.509\n10.1541/ieejsmas.127.75\n10.1109/TMI.2020.3005067\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.06.029\n10.1117/1.2710193"}
{"title": "A Dynamic Hysteresis Model and Nonlinear Control System for a Structure-Integrated Piezoelectric Sensor-Actuator.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric sensor-actuator plays an important role in micro high-precision dynamic systems such as medical robots and micro grippers. These mechanisms need high-precision position control, while the size of the sensor and actuator should be as small as possible. For this paper, we designed and manufactured a structure-integrated piezoelectric sensor-actuator and proposed its PID (Proportion Integral Differential) control system based on the dynamic hysteresis nonlinear model and the inverse model. Through simplifying the structure of the piezoelectric sensor-actuator by the centralized parameter method, this paper establishes its dynamic model and explores the input-output transfer function by taking the relationship between the output force and displacement as the medium. The experiment shows the maximum distance of the hysteresis curve is 0.26 \u03bcm. By parsing the hysteresis curve, this paper presents a dynamic hysteresis nonlinear model and its inverse model based on a 0.5 Hz quasi-static model and linear transfer function. Simulation results show that the accuracy of the static model is higher than that of the dynamic model when the frequency is 0.5 Hz, but the compensation accuracy of the dynamic model is obviously better than that of the static model with the increase of the frequency. This paper also proposes a control system for the sensor-actuator by means of the inverse model. The simulation results indicate that the output root mean square error was reduced to one-quarter of the original, which proves that the structure-integrated piezoelectric sensor-actuator and its control system have a great significance for signal sensing and output control of micro high-precision dynamic systems.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-01-07", "authors": ["XiaobiaoShan", "HenanSong", "HanCao", "LanshuangZhang", "XuhangZhao", "JizhuangFan"], "doi": "10.3390/s21010269\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa9d0e\n10.3390/s20040950\n10.1002/adfm.201806057\n10.1108/IR-08-2018-0159\n10.3390/s20143872\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/5/055011\n10.1109/TMECH.2014.2300333\n10.3390/s141120543\n10.1177/1045389X15575082\n10.3390/s20010134\n10.1007/s40430-018-1445-5\n10.3390/electronics8020169\n10.1063/1.5093000\n10.1016/S0957-4158(01)00043-5\n10.1109/20.43892\n10.3233/JAE-190086\n10.3233/JAE-171251\n10.3233/JAE-2007-750\n10.1109/TMECH.2008.2009936\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/4/045001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.09.004\n10.1063/1.3470117\n10.1109/TMECH.2015.2465868\n10.1063/1.4728575\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1533\n10.1155/S1024123X97000586\n10.1109/37.588158\n10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037216\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab49d7\n10.1109/TMECH.2007.892824\n10.1007/s11071-019-04804-1\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2012.02.086\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106880"}

For this purpose, a multi-analyser detector (MAD) was developed for the high-energy beamline P02.1 at PETRA III of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY). In order to be able to adjust the detector for the high photon energies of 60\u2005keV, an individually adjustable analyser-crystal setup was designed. The adjustment is performed via piezo stepper motors for each of the ten channels. The detector shows a low and flat background as well as a high signal-to-noise ratio. A range of standard materials were measured for characterizing the performance. Two exemplary experiments were performed to demonstrate the potential for sophisticated structural analysis with the MAD: (i) the structure of a complex material based on strontium niobate titanate and strontium niobate zirconate was determined and (ii) an in situ stroboscopy experiment with an applied electric field on a highly absorbing piezoceramic was performed.

The AOTFs with large interaction length apply the bulk acoustic wave (BAW) reflection from the input optical facet. Optimization is based on spectral approach to simulation of the BAW field in anisotropic media and Raman-Nath equations numerically solved for the inhomogeneous acoustic field. It was found that variation of the transducer dimensions can minimize RF power consumption of the AOTF. Comparison of the optimized transducer dimensions with those commonly used in quasicollinear paratellurite AOTFs showed that it is possible to improve the AOTF energy efficiency in about 2 times. It was shown that acoustic field simulation results obtained for one AOTF geometry can be applied to the other geometries but for equivalent frequency providing the same ultrasound beam ray spectrum width. It was also shown that when choosing the quasicollinear AOTF with reflection geometry, one should not rely only on the AO figure of merit value, since the energy efficiency of such AOTF type will be determined by the product of the AO figure of merit and the AOTF efficiency, which takes into account the change in the acoustic beam width in the reflection process.

The PVDF-CuFC showed higher Cs adsorption kinetics and adsorption capacity than PVDF-COOH. Moreover, as the initial pH increased, the amount of Cs adsorption by PVDF-CuFC also increased.

{"title": "Health Monitoring of Single-Element Piezoelectric Transducer Using Its Electromechanical Admittance.", "abstract": "The transducer is an essential part of all ultrasonic systems used for applications such as medical diagnostics, therapy, nondestructive evaluation, and cleaning because its health condition is vital to their proper operation. Defects within the active element, backing or other constitutive elements, and loss of adhesion between layers can significantly weaken the performance of a transducer. The objective of this work is to determine procedures to monitor the behavior of a single-element probe during its lifetime and detect degradations before they significantly affect the performance of the system. To achieve this, electromechanical admittance (EMA)-based method is envisaged numerically and experimentally. A simplified single-element transducer consisting of a piezoceramic disk, a bonding layer, and a backing is studied and the influence of bonding delamination on EMA is investigated. This study considers three different types of delaminations, which are named, respectively, \"center\" (circular delamination from the center of the disk toward the peripheric zone), \"peripheric\" (annular delamination from the peripheric zone toward the center), and \"wedge\" (wedge-shaped delamination with a given angle). For each case, a numerical model based on the finite-element (FE) method is developed: a 2-D FE analysis is implemented for the first two types of delaminations, taking advantage of their axisymmetric structure, and \"wedge\" delamination is modeled in 3-D. Then, transducers with different shapes of 3-D printed backings are mounted and experiments are conducted using an impedance analyzer. Finally, experimental results are found to be in good agreement with numerical solutions and it shows that changes in EMA can particularly reveal the occurrence and extent of delamination in an ultrasound probe.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2020-12-30", "authors": ["WenxiangDing", "MaximeBavencoffe", "MarcLethiecq"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3047944"}

On a molecular scale, these forces are detected by mechanically activated ion channels, which constitute the basis for hearing, touch, pain, cold, and heat sensation, among other physiological processes. Exciting high-resolution structural details of these channels are currently emerging that will eventually allow us to delineate the molecular determinants of gating and ion permeation. However, our structural-functional understanding across the family remains limited. Piezo1 is one of the largest and least understood of these channels, with various structurally identified features within its trimeric assembly. This study seeks to determine the modularity and function of Piezo1 channels by constructing deletion proteins guided by cryo EM structural knowledge. Our comprehensive functional study identified, for the first time, the minimal amino acid sequence of the full-length Piezo1 that can fold and function as the channel's pore domain between E2172 and the last residue E2547. While the addition of an anchor region has no effect on permeation properties. The Piezo1 pore domain is not pressure-sensitive and the appending of Piezo Repeat-A did not restore pressure-dependent gating, hence the sensing module must exist between residues 1 to 1952.

{"title": "Piezo2 channel in nodose ganglia neurons is essential in controlling hypertension in a pathway regulated directly by Nedd4-2.", "abstract": "Baroreflex plays a crucial role in regulation of arterial blood pressure (BP). Recently, Piezo1 and Piezo2, the mechanically-activated (MA) ion channels, have been identified as baroreceptors. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for regulating these baroreceptors in hypertension remains unknown. In this study, we used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and NG-Nitro-l-Arginine (L-NNA)- and Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertensive model rats to determine the role and mechanism of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in hypertension. We found that Piezo2 was dominantly expressed in baroreceptor nodose ganglia (NG) neurons and aortic nerve endings in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The expression of Piezo2 not Piezo1 was significantly downregulated in these regions in SHR and hypertensive model rats. Electrophysiological results showed that the rapidly adapting mechanically-activated (RA-MA) currents and the responsive neuron numbers were significantly reduced in baroreceptor NG neurons in SHR. In WKY rats, the arterial BP was elevated by knocking down the expression of Piezo2 or inhibiting MA channel activity by GsMTx4 in NG. Knockdown of Piezo2 in NG also attenuated the baroreflex and increased serum norepinephrine (NE) concentration in WKY rats. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment suggested that Piezo2 interacted with Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4 type 2 (Nedd4-2, also known as Nedd4L); Electrophysiological results showed that Nedd4-2 inhibited Piezo2 MA currents in co-expressed HEK293T cells. Additionally, Nedd4-2 was upregulated in NG baroreceptor neurons in SHR. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Piezo2 not Piezo1 may act as baroreceptor to regulate arterial BP in rats.

For efficient sensing in liquids, shear waves (either a thickness-shear bulk wave or a shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave) can achieve a high sensitivity, without significant loss of acoustic wave energy. On the other hand, longitudinal bulk waves or out-of-plane displacement waves (such as Rayleigh waves) enable efficient sampling functions and liquid manipulation.

{"title": "Free volume dependence of dielectric behaviour in sandwich-structured high dielectric performances of poly(vinylidene fluoride) composite films.", "abstract": "A dielectric film with a trilayer structure is fabricated to obtain both a high dielectric constant and superior electrical breakdown strength simultaneously. The outer layers of the trilayered composite film are composed of barium titanate (BTO) particles dispersed in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to ensure a relatively high dielectric constant, while the central layer of the composite film consists of exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) dispersed in PVDF to provide high electrical breakdown strength. Compared with pristine PVDF, the dielectric constant and breakdown strength are simultaneously enhanced due to the sandwich structure, and the dielectric loss is maintained at a low level. Most important of all, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) is applied to study the atomic-scale free volume holes of PVDF composite films and the effect of free volume holes on the dielectric constant and breakdown strength. Results show that the size of free volume holes of PVDF increased with the addition of BTO, but it decreased firstly and then increased with the BNNS loading. The correlation between dielectric properties and the size of free volume holes of the PVDF matrix was discussed in each layer. It is illustrated that the experimental dielectric constant of the PVDF/BTO single-layered film is consistent with the theoretical value at a lower BTO loading but smaller than the theoretical value at a higher BTO loading, which is probably ascribed to the increased size of free volume holes. The breakdown strength of the PVDF/BNNS film increased with the introduction of BNNS and the reduced size of free volume holes, which is ascribed to the reduced partial discharge phenomenon. The atomic-scale microstructure analysis based on free volume holes provides valuable ideas and new understanding for the study of the mechanism of the dielectric behaviour of polymer composites.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2020-12-19", "authors": ["LeiYang", "LanqiongYang", "KunMa", "YuWang", "TongSong", "LiliangGong", "JianSun", "LingZhao", "ZhihongYang", "JianmeiXu", "QingWang", "GuogangLi", "WeiZhou"], "doi": "10.1039/d0nr06070d"}

Little is known about the foreign body reaction of IPOM-meshes, which covered a defect of the parietal peritoneum. This is becoming more important, since IPOM procedure with peritoneal-sac resection and hernia port closing (IPOM plus) is more frequently used.\nIn 18 female minipigs, two out of three Polyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) -meshes (I: standard IPOM; II: IPOM with modified structure [bigger pores]; III: IPOM with the same structure as IPOM II\u2009+\u2009degradable hydrogel-coating) were placed in a laparoscopic IPOM procedure. Before mesh placement, a 2x2cm peritoneal defect was created. After 30\u2009days, animals were euthanized, adhesions were evaluated by re-laparoscopy and mesh samples were explanted for histological and immunohistochemichal investigations.\nAll animals recovered after implantation and had no complications during the follow-up period. Analysing foreign body reaction, the IPOM II mesh had a significant smaller inner granuloma, compared to the other meshes (IPOM II: 8.4\u2009\u00b5m\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 vs. IPOM I 9.1\u2009\u00b5m\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

A peritoneal defect covered by a standard or modified IPOM mesh was a significant factor for increasing foreign body granuloma, the amount of CD3+ lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages and decrease of pore size.\nA peritoneal defect covered by IPOM prostheses leads to an increased foreign body reaction compared to intact peritoneum.

The basic properties of such implants comprise of long-term stability and the filtering of fluids without the occurrence of undesirable blockages. This study describes the design and production of a novel material for the treatment of glaucoma disease that is based on electrospinning technology. Non-toxic, biocompatible and non-degradable polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) was selected as the implant material. The research investigated the resistance of this material to the growth of a fibroblast cell line without the use of antifibrotic agents such as mitomycin C. Three different types of PVDF were electrospun separately and mixed with polyethyleneoxide (PEO), following which the degree of cell growth resistance was evaluated. It was discovered that the fiber layers that contained PVDF blended with PEO evinced a statistically significant difference in metabolic activity compared to the PURE PVDF layers. Only small cell clusters formed on the layers that were resistant to cell fibrotization. As a result of the observed clustering, a new program was developed in MATLAB software for the determination of the number of cells involved in cluster formation, which then allowed for the determination of the spatial dependence between the cells in the form of a point pattern.

{"title": "Design of a resonant Luneburg lens for surface acoustic waves.", "abstract": "In this work we employ additive manufacturing to print a circular array of micropillars on an aluminium slab turning its top surface into a graded index metasurface for surface acoustic waves (SAW). The graded metasurface reproduces a Luneburg lens capable of focusing plane SAWs to a point. The graded index profile is obtained by exploiting the dispersion properties of the metasurface arising from the well-known resonant coupling between the micropillars (0.5\u00a0mm diameter and variable length \u223c3\u00a0mm) and the surface waves propagating in the substrate. From the analytical formulation of the metasurface's dispersion curves, a slow phase velocity mode is shown to arise from the hybridisation of the surface wave with the pillar resonance. This is used to compute the radial height profile corresponding to the refractive index given by Luneburg's equation. An initial validation of the lens design, achieved through ray theory, shows that ray trajectories have a strong frequency dependence, meaning that the lens will only work on a narrow band. An ultrasonic experiment at 500 kHz where plane SAWs are generated with a piezoelectric transducer and a laser scanner measures the out of plane displacement on the metasurface, validates the actual lens performance and the manufacturing technique. Finally, comparison between the ray analysis and experimental results offers insight into the behaviour of this type of metasurface especially in the proximity of the acoustic bandgaps and highlights the possibility for acoustic shielding.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-12-09", "authors": ["RafaelFuentes-Dom\u00ednguez", "MengtingYao", "AndreaColombi", "PaulDryburgh", "DonPieris", "AlexanderJackson-Crisp", "DanielColquitt", "AdamClare", "Richard JSmith", "MattClark"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106306"}

The good mechanical and environmental stability of these membranes allowed their use in at least 20 consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles, without significant loss of their characteristics.

{"title": "Critical comparison of image analysis workflows for quantitative cell morphological evaluation in assessing cell response to biomaterials.", "abstract": "Quantitative image analysis is an important tool in understanding cell fate processes through the study of cell morphological changes in terms of size, shape, number, and orientation. In this context, this work explores systematically the main challenges involved in the quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy images and also proposes a new protocol while comparing its outcome with the widely used ImageJ analysis. It is important to mention that fluorescence microscopy is by far most widely used in biocompatibility analysis (observing cell fate changes) of implantable biomaterials. In this study, we employed two different image analyses toolsets: (a) the conventionally employed ImageJ software, and (b) a recently developed automated digital image analyses framework, called ImageMKS. While ImageJ offers a powerful toolset for image analyses, it requires sophisticated user expertise to design and iteratively refine the analyses workflow. This workflow primarily comprises a sequence of image transformations that typically involve de-noising and labeling of features. On the other hand, ImageMKS automates the image analyses protocol to a large extent, and thereby mitigates the influence of the user bias on the final results. This aspect is addressed using a case study of C2C12 mouse myoblast cells grown on poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) based polymeric substrates. In particular, we used a number of fluorescence microscopy images of these mouse myoblasts grown on PVDF-based nanobiocomposites under the influence of electric field. In addition to the MKS workflows requiring much less user time because of their automation, it was observed that ImageMKS workflows consistently produced more reliable results that correlated better with the previously reported experimental studies.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2020-12-02", "authors": ["KRavikumar", "Sven PVoigt", "Surya RKalidindi", "BikramjitBasu"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-605X/abcf5e"}

Herein, novel microfiltration membranes based on 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride ([VBIm][Cl]) grafted PVDF (PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl]) were prepared via the non-solvent induced phase separation method. The chemical composition and microstructure of PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Water contact angle measurements. The results showed that an increasing in [VBIm][Cl] grafting content leads to the increasing hydrophilicity and wetting capacity of the PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] porous membranes. The anti-biofouling properties of membranes were evaluated by measuring the water flux before and after Bovine serum albumin solution treatment. It was found that the modified membranes presented a good anti-biofouling property. The degree of irreversible flux loss caused by protein adsorption dramatically reduced from 42.1% to 2.9% compared with the pristine hydrophobic PVDF membranes. Meanwhile, these PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] membranes also exhibited excellent bactericidal properties against both gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus saureus and gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, while PVDF membranes did not show any antibacterial activity. The vitro biocompatibility of the modified membranes was studied by hemolysis analysis, the platelet adhesion observation, thromboelastography assay and cytotoxicity assay. It was found that the incorporation of [VBIm][Cl] into PVDF membranes has less effect on the hemolysis and cytotoxicity of PVDF membranes. Furthermore, both hydrophilicity and charges of the membrane surface played important role in the adhesion and activation of platelet cells, which consequently affected the clotting process of whole blood. The membrane with appropriate [VBIm][Cl] grafting ratio (2.94\u00a0wt.%) exhibited good hemocompatibility with less blood coagulation effect. As an ultrafiltration membrane, PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] membranes have potential applications in the biomedical field due to the improved antibacterial property and biocompatibility.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

Here, we studied Sb behavior in sediment of a shallow lake in the plain rivers network in Taihu Basin that suffers continual Sb inputs from textile plants. The diffusive gradients in thin films techniques (DGT) made of zirconium oxide based binding resin gel (ZrO-Chelex), agarose diffusive gel and polyvinylidene fluoride filter were deployed in water and sediment to obtain a high-resolution record in situ. The results indicated that (1) pollutants released by textile plants caused relatively high Sb(\u2162), Sb(\u2164) and organoantimony concentrations in the eutrophic shallow lake, (2) Sb was seldomly mobile in the oxic layer where Sb(\u2162) was sorbed on Fe(\u2162) oxides and gradually formed Fe-Sb complexes in the sediment, but in the anoxic environment (oxidation-reduction potential: 366\u00a0-\u00a0-344 mv) Sb(V), Fe(\u2161) and P (V) were simultaneously released to resupply the porewater, (3) the release of Sb from solid phase is decided by the redox condition, and the rate of release is dependent on the labile Sb content of the sediment.

According to the mechanical boundary conditions, the electromechanical equivalent circuits and frequency equation of various piezoelectric composite vibration systems can be obtained, including the radially sandwiched spherical piezoelectric transducer. The correctness of the proposed theory is verified via comparison with the finite element method and the previous theoretical model. In addition, the 2nd-order effective mechanical coupling coefficient for the radially sandwiched spherical piezoelectric transducer is higher than that of 1st-order within a specific range of wall thickness, which can be designed as the high-frequency transducer.

The protein (BSA) band (~0.5\u00a0\u03bcg) and E. coli extract comprising ~25\u00a0\u03bcg total protein can be visualized on polyacrylamide gels. Compared to both Coomassie and Ponceau S staining, the current method displayed more intense bands when proteins are transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Although the walnut-dye (WD) method does not require a time-consuming destaining step, excess background stain can simply be removed by washing in water. Extract from old dried black husks and extract from fresh green husks kept for a year was also effective. Using LC-MS, Myricetin and/or Kaempferol were found to be active compounds responsible for staining proteins. Compared to traditional Coomassie method, the inclusion of expensive and toxic solvents (methanol and acetic acid) is completely avoided resulting in positive health, environmental and economic benefits. In view of all these advantages, the WD method has immense potential to replace currently used protein staining techniques.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2020-11-20", "authors": ["UmarMushtaq", "Sehar SaleemBhat", "Arif AliParray", "SumaiyaNabi", "Aflaq HamidWani", "Ahsanul HaqQurashi", "Khawar SohailSiddiqui", "Firdous AhmadKhanday"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109310"}

Effect of mechanical loads on the basic physical parameters of a piezoelectric pn junction, such as potential barrier region width, contact potential difference, electric potential, and carrier concentrations are analyzed numerically. Results show that asymmetry compressive stresses exert more influence on the movement of the potential barrier region's boundary and the migration of carrier compare to asymmetry tensile stresses. It is also found that asymmetry compressive stresses lead to a pn junction with a thin potential barrier region which enhances the chance of carrier's passing through of potential barrier region.

The occlusal surfaces of 20 extracted human upper and lower third molars without caries or restoration were reduced to expose the occlusal dentin, and the prepared occlusal surfaces were acid-etched with 32% phosphoric acid to remove the smear layer. The tooth specimens were connected to a fluid flow measurement instrument (nanoFlow, IB SYSTEMS, Seoul, Korea), permeability through dentin via dentinal fluid flow (DFF) was measured for 300\u202fs, and the average DFF rate (Baseline DFF rate) was calculated. A desensitizer (SuperSeal, Phoenix Dental, Fenton, MI, USA) was applied to the acid-etched occlusal dentin surface of 10 randomly selected tooth specimens, left for 10\u202fs, and rubbed with a microbrush for 30\u202fs (Group 1). For the remaining teeth, the desensitizer was applied, and a shockwave (100\u202f\u03bcm stroke, 10,000\u202fG) was applied for 10\u202fs (2 shots/s) and rubbed with a microbrush for 30\u202fs (Group 2). After desensitizer application, subsequent DFF was measured for 600\u202fs, and the average DFF rate was calculated (post-application DFF rate).

Understanding the granulation process is vital to address this issue. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an essential role in sludge granulation. However, one crucial aspect of EPS, the adhesive and viscoelastic properties, has been neglected in AGS studies. In this study, we set up two reactors fed with COD/N ratios of 100: 5 (R1) and 100: 10 (R2) for comparison, to investigate the adhesive and viscoelastic properties of sludge EPS during the sludge granulation. We found that R2 showed a more rapid sludge granulation with more stable granules formed, contained a higher abundance of amoA gene, and had a higher production of polysaccharides than R1. We also found a sharp decrease in polysaccharide production and \u03b2-sheets abundance accompanied by granule size decrease in R1 on Day 80, indicating their essential roles in sludge granulation and granule stability. QCM-D (quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring) results showed that EPS became less adhesive and inclined to form unstable layers on the mineral surfaces along with the sludge granulation process. In contrast, they showed the opposite behavior and became more adhesive on the PVDF sensors. Our results suggested that higher polysaccharides, a higher \u03b2-sheets band in proteins, and lower mineral surface-adhesive and viscoelastic properties benefited the aerobic sludge granulation process and the granule maintenance.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2020-11-14", "authors": ["YijingShi", "YangLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128033"}

{"title": "Non-contact measurement of the thickness of a surface film using a superimposed ultrasonic standing wave.", "abstract": "Most methods used to measure the thickness of thin liquid or solid surface films and coatings need access to the coated surface. In this work reflected ultrasonic pulses were used to measure a coating thickness from a solid back face. Piezoelectric transducers on the solid back face emitted ultrasound waves and received the waves that bounced off the front face. The magnitude of the reflected wave was dependent on the film thickness at the front face. Most pulse-echo ultrasonic approaches use the time-of-flight through the surface layer to determine its thickness. However, as the film becomes thinner, the reflected echoes overlap and there is often an acoustic mismatch between the solid and the surface film that reduces the signal strength. In this work, we propose the use of an ultrasonic continuously repeated chirp longitudinal wave to amplify the effect of the surface film. Multiple reflections interfere within the solid to form a superimposed standing wave whose amplitude spectrum is highly dependent on the surface film thickness thus overcoming the acoustic mismatch problem. Two bare 10\u00a0MHz piezoelectric elements were bonded to a 10\u00a0mm thick aluminium solid in a pitch-catch arrangement such that one continuously sends repeating chirp ultrasound waves and the other acts as the receiver. The transmitter was set to send a repeating chirp wave of 4\u00a0ms duration corresponding to the bandwidth of the transducer in order to maximise signal amplitude.

Appropriate deformation models of soft and hard tissues are required for the achievement of real-time haptic feedback. To improve accuracy of modeling and haptic feedback simulation for maxillofacial virtual surgery, mechanical characteristics of soft and hard tissues should be explored.\nCraniofacial soft tissues from one male and female cadavers were divided into two layers: skin and muscle. Maxillofacial tissues were divided into frontal, chin, temporalis, masseter regions. Insertion and cutting process were conducted using VMX42 5-axis linkage system and recorded by piezoelectric dynamometer. Maximum stiffness values were analyzed, and insertion curves before puncture were fitted using a polynomial model. Elasticity modulus and hardness of maxillofacial hard tissues were measured and analyzed using Berkovich nanoindentation.\nTissues in different maxillofacial regions, as well as from different layers (skin and muscle), displayed various mechanical performance. Maximum stiffness values and cutting force of soft tissues in male and female had significant difference. The third-order polynomial was demonstrated to fit the insertion curves well before puncture. Furthermore, elasticity modulus and hardness of enamel were significantly greater than that of zygoma, maxilla and mandible.\nMechanical properties of hard tissues are relatively stable, which can be applied in virtual surgery system for physical model construction. Insertion model and cutting force for soft tissues are meaningful and applicable and can be utilized to promote the accuracy of response for haptic feedback sensations.", "journal": "International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery", "date": "2020-11-02", "authors": ["YuZhuang", "JieChen", "QingchengLiu", "FanZou", "YuhengLin", "QinglongAn", "HongboYu"], "doi": "10.1007/s11548-020-02257-1\n10.1016/j.ogc.2006.01.007\n10.1097/scs.0000000000000862\n10.1016/j.joms.2012.01.031\n10.1016/j.cag.2006.01.029\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.03.004\n10.1177/0954411911424210\n10.1007/s11548-010-0508-6\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e318207f2e8\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e318250556e\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e3182688ed7\n10.1016/j.matdes.2018.107563\n10.1557/JMR.1992.1564\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2006.07.003\n10.1177/0954411913483428\n10.1016/j.artmed.2014.08.005\n10.1007/s11043-009-9098-5\n10.1016/S8756-3282(01)00624-X\n10.1016/S0142-9612(97)00073-2\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2012.11.005\n10.1177/0022034516688659\n10.1016/S0021-9290(99)00111-6\n10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199904)45:1<48::aid-jbm7>3.0.co;2-5"}

The mechanical behaviours and piezopotential properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) NWs under lateral bending are investigated in this paper by using a multiscale modelling technique combining first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and finite-element calculations. Two phase transformation processes are successively found in ZnO NWs by increasing the bending force. As a result, the inner and outer surfaces of bent ZnO NWs transform from the parent wurtzite (WZ) structure to a hexagonal (HX) structure and a body-centred-tetragonal (BCT-4) structure, respectively. Different material properties are found among the WZ, BCT-4, and HX structures, which result in a significant change in the piezopotential distribution in bent ZnO NWs after the phase transformation. Meanwhile, the piezopotential generated in bent ZnO NWs can be enhanced by an order of magnitude due to the phase transformation. Moreover, a significant increase in the electronic band gap is found in the transformed HX structure, which implies that the phase transformation may also affect the piezopotential in bent ZnO NWs by modifying their semiconducting properties especially when the doping level of NWs is large.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2020-10-27", "authors": ["JinZhang"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/abc49f"}

The Baden-Walker scale, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire-Short Form (OAB-q SF), the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12) and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale were used to assess the degree of prolapse, urinary filling and sexual symptoms and the level of satisfaction before and after surgery, respectively. Conventional laparoscopic material and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh were used.\nEighteen patients were included with a minimum follow-up time of 6months. The mean surgical time was 70.3\u00b123.8min. Anatomic correction of prolapse was seen in all cases. Only one recurrence was detected. High levels of patient satisfaction were achieved.\nLACS allowed the anatomical reconstruction of the pelvic floor and proved to be a minimally invasive, fast, effective, safe and reproducible technique.

A combination of physical and chemical (total solids, protein, phosphorus, ammonia, chemical oxygen demand) methods, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and Live/Dead viability assay) and genetic sequencing over a period of 81 days was used to provide an in-depth understanding of the impact of different polymer materials on biofilm formation, bacteria population, and wastewater treatment performance. The results showed that hydrophobic polymeric materials (i.e., PP and PVDF) promoted initial cell adhesion and biofilm formation (<16 days) better than the hydrophilic (i.e., ABS and HDPE) polymeric materials. However, under longer-term and steady-state operation (after 81 days), the hydrophilic materials demonstrated larger mature biofilm quantities and better wastewater treatment performance. The sequencing data showed biofilm bacterial community structures of the ABS and HDPE to be significantly different compared to the other polymeric materials tested. The data showed a positive correlation as well between the phyla present on the ABS and HDPE and COD removal. These results suggest that the type of polymeric material play an important role in biofilm development, bacterial population diversity, and wastewater treatment performance for anaerobic fixed-film systems, and ABS and HDPE performed better than the widely used PVC in the industry.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2020-10-09", "authors": ["YurenZhou", "Patrick DKiely", "RichardKibbee", "BanuOrmeci"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128477"}
{"title": "Mechanical Feed-Forward Loops Contribute to Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.", "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive scarring disease characterized by extracellular matrix accumulation and altered mechanical properties of lung tissue. Recent studies support the hypothesis that these compositional and mechanical changes create a progressive feed-forward loop in which enhanced matrix deposition and tissue stiffening contribute to fibroblast and myofibroblast differentiation and activation, which further perpetuates matrix production and stiffening. The biomechanical properties of tissues are sensed and responded to by mechanotransduction pathways that facilitate sensing of changes in mechanical cues by tissue resident cells and convert the mechanical signals into downstream biochemical signals. Although our understanding of mechanotransduction pathways associated with pulmonary fibrosis remains incomplete, recent progress has allowed us to begin to elucidate the specific mechanisms supporting fibrotic feed-forward loops. The mechanosensors discussed here include integrins, Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels, and nonselective ion channels. Also discussed are downstream transcription factors, including myocardin-related transcription factor and Yes-associated protein/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif.

It is based on the principle of summation on a diametrically vibrating summing plate of vibrations of radially mounted Langevin transducers. The method of their design was created and the optimal design dimensions of the transducers were established. This made it possible to manufacture and research practical designs of transducers at frequencies of 30 and 90 kHz. The created transducers together with disk radiators allowed creating US vibrations of 155 dB in the gas at a frequency of 31.67 kHz and 151 dB at a frequency of 92.82 kHz. In this case, the power of the generated vibrations was limited by existing radiators of disk form and a small wave resistance of gas. As a result, the transducers provided radiation up to 1800 W at a frequency of 31.67 kHz and up to 250 W at a frequency of 92.82 kHz of acoustic power. The transducer can be used at processing of liquids, such as dispersion, emulsification, extraction, degassing of liquids, sterilization, and homogenization. The transducer can be used for agglomeration of suspended dispersed particles in gases, drying of various materials, and liquid spraying when exposed to gases. There are no restrictions on the number of simultaneously operating transducers. However, the overall dimensions exclude tight packaging.

{"title": "SARS-CoV-2 in environmental perspective: Occurrence, persistence, surveillance, inactivation and challenges.", "abstract": "The unprecedented global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is depicting the distressing pandemic consequence on human health, economy as well as ecosystem services. So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators.", "journal": "Chemical engineering journal (Lausanne, Switzerland : 1996)", "date": "2020-09-10", "authors": ["S VenkataMohan", "ManupatiHemalatha", "HarishankarKopperi", "IRanjith", "A KiranKumar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cej.2020.126893"}

Graphene oxide (GO) was used to cover the interface pores of the pristine PVDF membranes via vacuum filtration, and polypyrrole (PPy) was polymerized on the surface to further decorate the membrane structure. Interestingly, the modified membranes exhibited a multilayer structure due to synergistic effect of GO and PPy. The structure and property of PVDF loose NF membranes were investigated in detail.

{"title": "Piezoelectric and Magnetoelectric Scaffolds for Tissue Regeneration and Biomedicine: A Review.", "abstract": "Electric fields are ubiquitous throughout the body, playing important role in a multitude of biological processes including osteo-regeneration, cell signaling, nerve regeneration, cardiac function, and DNA replication. An increased understanding of the role of electric fields in the body has led to the development of devices for biomedical applications that incorporate electromagnetic fields as an intrinsically novel functionality (e.g., bioactuators, biosensors, cardiac/neural electrodes, and tissues scaffolds). However, in the majority of the aforementioned devices, an implanted power supply is necessary for operation, and therefore requires highly invasive procedures. Thus, the ability to apply electric fields in a minimally invasive manner to remote areas of the body remains a critical and unmet need. Here, we report on the potential of magnetoelectric (ME)-based composites to overcome this challenge. ME materials are capable of producing localized electric fields in response to an applied magnetic field, which the body is permeable to. Yet, the use of ME materials for biomedical applications is just beginning to be explored. Here, we present on the potential of ME materials to be utilized in biomedical applications. This will be presented alongside current state-of-the-art for in vitro and in vivo electrical stimulation of cells and tissues.

We show the first-principles plus Monte Carlo simulation evidence that many hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics (e.g. organic PhMDA) can be ideal candidates, which are also flexible and lead-free. Owing to the specific features of hydrogen bonding, their proton hopping barrier will drastically increase with prolonged proton transfer distance, while their hydrogen-bonded network can be easily compressed or stretched due to softness of hydrogen bonds. Their barriers as well as the Curie temperature can be approximately doubled upon a tensile strain as low as 2%. Their Curie temperature can be tuned exactly to room temperature by fixing a strain in one direction, and in another direction, an unprecedented ultra-high piezoelectric coefficient of 2058 pC/N can be obtained. This value is even underestimated and can be greatly enhanced when applying a smaller strain.

{"title": "Rapid Soft Material Actuation Through Droplet Evaporation.", "abstract": "Soft material actuation is a promising field that can potentially solve several limitations of traditional robotic systems. These systems comprise soft and flexible materials to achieve high degrees of freedom and compliance with their surroundings. One method to actuate such structures is to vaporize liquid that is embedded inside the soft material. The soft elastomers are inflated since the generated vapor occupies a much larger volume after phase transformation. The simplest and widely used design to vaporize such liquids is installing a heating element near the liquid. Heating the system beyond the boiling point rapidly boils the liquid and deforms the structure. However, this technique possesses several limitations, such as the heating element must be in the liquid's vicinity, and boiling the liquid requires high temperatures. In addition, embedding a small amount of liquid for faster boiling prevents the use of valves to exhaust the vapor. Instead, the structure is slowly cooled until it returns to its original position. In this study, these limitations are addressed by combining heating with vibrating mesh atomization. The atomizer disperses the liquid into small droplets, which vaporize much faster as compared with simply heating the bulk liquid. Actuation through vibrating mesh atomization was first characterized and compared with other techniques. Then, the introduced method was used to demonstrate cyclic actuation, and a bistable structure was designed and fabricated to demonstrate gripping motion.", "journal": "Soft robotics", "date": "2020-08-25", "authors": ["Han-JooLee", "PeerasaitPrachaseree", "Kenneth JLoh"], "doi": "10.1089/soro.2020.0055"}

{"title": "Immediate Oral Rehabilitation With Quad Zygomatic Implants: Ultrasonic Technique vs Conventional Drilling.", "abstract": "Inserting zygomatic implants is a challenging surgery and requires special care and great precision. Piezoelectric surgery offers several advantages: more precise bone cutting with improved intraoperative visibility and a low temperature increase. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate whether ultrasonic instruments can be as effective as standard drilling instruments for zygomatic implant surgery in terms of clinical outcomes. Ninety-two patients with atrophic maxilla were included in the study. Implant sites were prepared with the ultrasonic technique (test group = 47 patients) or traditional drilling (control group = 45 patients). In total, 368 zygomatic implants were inserted (202 with the extrasinus technique, 77 with the sinus slot technique, and 89 with the Br\u00e5nemark technique). Complete arch provisional prostheses were delivered 3 to 5 hours after the surgical operations. The mean follow-up after surgery was 24 months (range = 12-32 months). The primary outcome evaluations were based on implant survival rates and postoperative complications. Operative time and surgeon's stress were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Implant survival rate was 100% in the test and 98.89% in the control group. Postoperative complications were seen in 9 patients (4 in the test and 5 in the control group); the difference was not statistically significant. Operative time was longer in the test group; however, surgeons were more comfortable using ultrasonic instruments. Within the limitations of this preliminary study, the ultrasonic technique was a feasible alternative to traditional drilling for zygomatic implant surgery.", "journal": "The Journal of oral implantology", "date": "2020-08-12", "authors": ["MarcoMozzati", "GiorgiaGallesio", "FundaGoker", "MargheritaTumedei", "PaoleschiCesare", "AndreaTedesco", "MassimoDel Fabbro"], "doi": "10.1563/aaid-joi-D-19-00195"}

{"title": "An Exact and Practical Analyzing Model for Radial Vibration of Piezoelectric Spherical Transducers With Arbitrary Wall Thickness.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric spherical transducers have attracted extensive attention in hydroacoustics and health monitoring. However, most reported piezoelectric spherical transducers are merely analyzed by the thin spherical shell theory, which is unsuitable for the gradually increased spherical shell thickness. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the radial vibration theory of the piezoelectric spherical transducer with arbitrary wall thickness. Herein, an exact analyzing model for the radial vibration of the piezoelectric spherical transducer with arbitrary wall thickness is proposed. The radial displacement and electric potential for radial vibration of the piezoelectric spherical transducer are precisely given, and then, the electromechanical equivalent circuit is obtained. Based on the electromechanical equivalent circuit, the resonance/antiresonance frequency equations of piezoelectric spherical transducers in the radial vibration are obtained. Besides, the relationship between performance parameters and wall thicknesses is discussed. The wall thickness has a significant influence on the performance parameters of the spherical transducer. The accuracy of the theory is validated by comparing the results with the experiment and finite element analysis.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2020-08-07", "authors": ["ShaWang", "ShuyuLin"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3014437"}
{"title": "Energy Integration Method for Calculating k", "abstract": "Piezoelectric resonators have been extensively used as filters, actuator, and sensors. The effective electromechanical coupling coefficient ( [Formula: see text] is the most useful parameter to evaluate the electromechanical conversion efficiency of piezoelectric resonators. However, even for simple geometry piezoelectric resonators, such as disks, the coupling between different modes makes the resonant characteristics very complex. The coupling causes low electromechanical coupling efficiency of the intended mode. We propose a finite-element-based energy integration method to calculate [Formula: see text] of piezoelectric resonators. This method is more accurate than the conventional resonance-antiresonance method and provides a powerful tool for the design optimization of pure mode resonators. A special case studied here is the fundamental thickness extensional (TE) mode of PZT-8 disks in the aspect ratio range of 2-20. Our results showed that multimode coupling near this mode can be greatly suppressed by modifying the edge surface of the disk to a convex shape. Such an optimized design could enhance [Formula: see text] of the fundamental TE mode by as much as 10%-45% depending on the aspect ratio.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2020-08-04", "authors": ["QiZhou", "WenwuCao"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3011464"}

Based on this model, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on the acoustic-structural coupling of an annular and circular diaphragm-coupled PMUT (AC-PMUT) with a new excitation method. The model-derived results are in good agreement with the simulation and experimental results. Then, an optimized design has been presented to achieve high-output pressure and a good array working performance. In summary, a comparison of the array working performance is conducted between the arrays that consist of AC-PMUTs and traditional circular diaphragm PMUTs (C-PMUTs). The results indicate that the AC-PMUT array has a much lower crosstalk effect than that of the traditional C-PMUT array. By this means, the AC-PMUT array can fully use the high vibration amplitude achieved by each AC-PMUT cell to improve its output ability. As a result, the highest ultrasonic output pressure generated by the AC-PMUT array in its resonant condition can achieve an increase of 155%, compared with that generated by the C-PMUT array.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2020-08-04", "authors": ["TingzhongXu", "LiboZhao", "ZhuangdeJiang", "ShuaishuaiGuo", "ZhikangLi", "PingYang", "GuoxiLuo", "LinSun", "LiangchiZhang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3008179"}

However, this novel method has a problem of low reading speed. To overcome this problem, a novel ferroelectric recording medium with large nonlinear permittivity is required because this data storage method uses the nonlinear dielectric response induced by small-amplitude ac bias to detect the bit data recorded in the form of polarization direction. Therefore, this article discusses nonlinear permittivity enhancement from the viewpoint of data storage application in the framework of the phenomenological theory. We reveal that the Curie-point control is one of the key techniques in material design for FPDS because nonlinear permittivity increases precipitously as the Curie temperature is approached, as with the linear permittivity and piezoelectric constants.

{"title": "S-MRUT: Sectored-Multiring Ultrasonic Transducer for Selective Powering of Brain Implants.", "abstract": "One of the main challenges of the current ultrasonic transducers for powering brain implants is the complexity of focusing ultrasonic waves in various axial and lateral directions. The available transducers usually use electrically controlled phased array for beamforming the ultrasonic waves, which increases the complexity of the system even further. In this article, we propose a straightforward solution for selective powering of brain implants to remove the complexity of conventional phased arrays. Our approach features a Sectored-Multiring Ultrasonic Transducer (S-MRUT) on a single piezoelectric sheet, specifically designed for powering implantable devices for optogenetics in freely moving animals. The proposed unidirectional S-MRUT is capable of focusing the ultrasonic waves on brain implants located at different depths and regions of the brain. The S-MRUT is designed based on Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP) theory, simulated in COMSOL, and fabricated with the microfabrication process. The acoustic profile of the seven different configurations of the S-MRUT was measured using a hydrophone with the total number of 7436 grid points. The measurements show the ability of the proposed S-MRUT to sweep the focus point of the acoustic waves in the axial direction in depths of 1 - 3 mm, which is suitable for powering implants in the striatum of the mouse. Furthermore, the proposed S-MRUT demonstrates a steering area with an average radius of 0.862 mm and 0.678 mm in experiments and simulations, respectively.

The investigators hypothesized laser osteotomy would render acceptable bone healing based on the intraoperative findings and postoperative cut surface analysis.\nWe designed and implemented a comparative bone-cutting surgery in the minipig mandible with a cold ablation robot-guided Er:YAG laser osteotome (CARLO) and a piezoelectric (PZE) osteotome. The sample was composed of different patterns of defects in the mandibles of six grown-up female Goettingen minipigs. The predictor variable was Er:YAG osteotomy and PZE osteotomy. The outcome variable was the cut surface characteristics and bone healing at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively. Descriptive and qualitative comparison was executed.\nThe sample was composed of four kinds of bone defects on both sides of the mandibles of six minipigs. We observed more bleeding during the operation, open-cut surfaces, and a faster healing pattern with the laser osteotomy. There was a possible association between the intraoperative findings, postoperative cut surface analysis, and the bone healing pattern.\nThe results of this study suggest that characteristic open-cut surfaces could explain favorable bone healing after laser osteotomy. Future studies will focus on the quantification of the early healing characteristics after laser osteotomy, its diverse application, and the safety feature. Lasers Surg.

The main outcomes measures were success rates in ED (International Index of Erectile Function-erectile function change, conversion of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors non-responders) and PD (change in deviation and plaque size), differences of used sources of energy, and energy flux densities (EFDs).\n3 different sources of energies are used, that is electromagnetic, electrohydraulic, and piezoelectric .The devices markedly distinguish in the available spectrum of the EFD ranging between 0.09 and 0.55 mJ/mm\u00b2. In terms of the biological effects, the relevant energy parameters are\u00a0-6 dB and the 5 MPa focus, which differ substantially between the ESWT devices. In addition, a great variability in the treatment protocols and applied energy is obvious. The preliminary own experiences with low intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy in 160 ED non-responders and 190 patients with PD with success rates of 45% and 47%, respectively, are reported.\nPositive results were published with all 6 ESWT devices in question in patients with organic ED but with huge differences regarding the EFD and the total energies applied. There is growing evidence that concentrated treatment protocols and increasing energies may yield better results.

Here we present a voltage-free ionization method, Vibrating Sharp-edge Spray Ionization (VSSI), which can generate a spray of liquid samples using only one standard microscope glass slide to which a piezoelectric transducer is attached. Compared with existing ambient ionization methods, VSSI eliminates the need for a high electric field (~5000\u2009V\u00b7cm\nThe VSSI device was fabricated by attaching a piezoelectric transducer onto a standard glass microscope slide using epoxy glue. Liquid sample was aerosolized by either placing a droplet onto the vibrating edge of the glass slide or touching a wet surface with the glass edge. Mass spectrometric detection was achieved by placing the VSSI device 0.5-1\u2009cm from the inlet of the mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive, ThermoScientific).\nVSSI is demonstrated to ionize a diverse array of chemical species, including small organic molecules, carbohydrates, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Preliminary sensitivity experiments show that high-quality mass spectra of acetaminophen can be obtained by consuming 100 femtomoles of the target. The dual spray of VSSI was also demonstrated by performing in-droplet denaturation of ubiquitin. Finally, due to the voltage-free nature and the direct-contact working mode of VSSI, it has been successfully applied for the detection of chemicals directly from human fingertips.\nOverall, we report a compact ionization method based on vibrating sharp-edges.

Intraoral chinplasty was performed during the correction of dentofacial dysmorphisms or associated with nasal surgery.
