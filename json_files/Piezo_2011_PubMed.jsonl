Results showed that the total resistance decreased by about 45% when the feed velocity was increased during clarification of red plum juice due to change in cake resistance. Also, increasing the feed temperature from 20 to 30\u00b0C decreased the total fouling resistance by about 9% due to decreases in the irreversible and reversible fouling resistances. Also, mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membrane (which is hydrophilic) had a lower cake resistance compared to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (which is hydrophobic). Examination of the microfiltration of watermelon juice showed that R t decreased by about 54% when the feed temperature was increased from 20 to 50\u00b0C, partially due to the reduction of reversible fouling resistance by 78%. Also, increasing transmembrane pressures from 0.5 to 2.5 bars greatly increased total fouling resistance.

{"title": "Development and Evaluation of an Actuated MRI-Compatible Robotic System for MRI-Guided Prostate Intervention.", "abstract": "This paper reports the design, development, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility evaluation of an actuated transrectal prostate robot for MRI-guided needle intervention in the prostate. The robot performs actuated needle MRI-guidance with the goals of providing (i) MRI compatibility, (ii) MRI-guided needle placement with accuracy sufficient for targeting clinically significant prostate cancer foci, (iii) reducing interventional procedure times (thus increasing patient comfort and reducing opportunity for needle targeting error due to patient motion), (iv) enabling real-time MRI monitoring of interventional procedures, and (v) reducing the opportunities for error that arise in manually actuated needle placement. The design of the robot, employing piezo-ceramic-motor actuated needle guide positioning and manual needle insertion, is reported. Results of a MRI compatibility study show no reduction of MRI signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) with the motors disabled. Enabling the motors reduces the SNR by 80% without RF shielding, but SNR is only reduced by 40% to 60% with RF shielding. The addition of radio-frequency shielding is shown to significantly reduce image SNR degradation caused by the presence of the robotic device. An accuracy study of MRI-guided biopsy needle placements in a prostate phantom is reported. The study shows an average in-plane targeting error of 2.4 mm with a maximum error of 3.7 mm. These data indicate the system's needle targeting accuracy is similar to that obtained with a previously reported manually actuated system, and is sufficient to reliably sample clinically significant prostate cancer foci under MRI-guidance.", "journal": "IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics : a joint publication of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society and the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division", "date": "2013-01-18", "authors": ["AxelKrieger", "Sang-EunSong", "Nathan BCho", "IulianIordachita", "PeterGuion", "GaborFichtinger", "Louis LWhitcomb"], "doi": "10.1109/TMECH.2011.2163523\n10.1016/S0090-4295(97)00306-3\n10.1038/pcan.2009.42\n10.1007/s00345-007-0151-1\n10.1016/j.eururo.2008.06.001\n10.1586/era.09.63\n10.1002/rcs.192\n10.1002/pros.20298\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.9.121806.160642\n10.1016/S0022-5347(05)00065-0\n10.1186/1748-717X-2-36\n10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07219.x\n10.1007/s00330-005-0100-6\n10.1080/10929080601168254\n10.1080/13645700701520735\n10.1088/0031-9155/55/5/N02\n10.1007/s00330-004-2458-2\n10.1007/s00330-006-0421-0\n10.1016/j.urology.2004.02.036"}

The SAW gyroscopic effect is investigated by applying the surface effective permittivity method in the regime of small ratios of the rotation velocity and the frequency of the SAW. The theoretical analysis indicates that the larger velocity shift was observed from the rotated X-112\u00b0Y LiTaO3 substrate. Then, two SAW delay lines with reverse direction and an operation frequency of 160 MHz are fabricated on a same X-112\u00b0Y LiTaO3 chip as the feedback of two SAW oscillators, which act as the sensor element. The single-phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT) and combed transducers were used to structure the delay lines to improve the frequency stability of the oscillator. The rotation of a piezoelectric medium gives rise to a shift of the propagation velocity of SAW due to the Coriolis force, resulting in the frequency shift of the SAW device, and hence, the evaluation of the sensor performance. Meanwhile, the differential structure was performed to double the sensitivity and compensate for the temperature effects.

Microelectromechanical (MEMS)-based generation techniques can allow for the autonomous operation of implantable biosensors by generating electrical power to replace or supplement existing battery-based power systems. By supplementing existing battery-based power systems for implantable biosensors, the operational lifetime of the sensor is increased. In addition, the potential for a greater amount of available power allows additional components to be added to the biosensing module, such as computational and wireless and components, improving functionality and performance of the biosensor. Photovoltaic, thermovoltaic, micro fuel cell, electrostatic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric based generation schemes are evaluated in this paper for applicability for implantable biosensing. MEMS-based generation techniques that harvest ambient energy, such as vibration, are much better suited for implantable biosensing applications than fuel-based approaches, producing up to milliwatts of electrical power. High power density MEMS-based approaches, such as piezoelectric and electromagnetic schemes, allow for supplemental and replacement power schemes for biosensing applications to improve device capabilities and performance.

The most significant studies are reviewed and integrated into a practical approach to the understanding and designation of these lesions. A paradigm shift is suggested regarding use of the term \"biocorrosion\" to supplant \"erosion\" as it continues to be misused in the United States and many other countries of the world. Biocorrosion embraces the chemical, biochemical, and electrochemical degradation of tooth substance caused by endogenous and exogenous acids, proteolytic agents, as well as the piezoelectric effects only on dentin. Abfraction, representing the microstructural loss of tooth substance in areas of stress concentration, should not be used to designate all NCCLs because these lesions are commonly multifactorial in origin. Appropriate designation of a particular NCCL depends upon the interplay of the specific combination of three major mechanisms: stress, friction, and biocorrosion, unique to that individual case.

The measurement volume is scanned in a circle with sub-micron radius, allowing the determination of diffusion coefficients and concentrations without any a priori knowledge of the size of the detection volume. This is highly important in measurements on two-dimensional surfaces, where the volume size, and therefore the quantitative outcome of the experiment, is determined by the relative position of the surface and the objective focus, a parameter difficult to control in practice. The technique is applied to diffusion measurements on model membrane systems: supported lipid bilayers and giant unilamellar vesicles. We show that the method is insensitive to membrane positioning and to disturbing processes on faster or slower time scales than diffusion, and yields accurate results even for fluctuating or drifting membranes.

We evaluated the different possible actuation methods for an endoscopic needle holder and proposed a new design of hybrid local-actuation, including a micro DC motor and a piezoelectric (PZT) actuator. The DC motor provided the long movement course required for opening-closing function of the gripper while the PZT guaranteed the high gripping force required for holding the needle. A compact serial configuration was considered for the actuators, producing an overall size of 10 mm in diameter and 39 mm in length, so that it could be implemented in the limited space available. The efficacy of the design was analyzed in a simulation study, using FEM and it was shown that the needle holder is capable to apply a sufficiently high gripping force of 22 N.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Characterization of maternal body movement during sleep before and after parturition.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the different features of body movements for females before and after parturition. Body movement signal was measured by a piezoelectric sensor board which was deployed on the abdominal position beneath a mattress during sleep to monitor pressure changes around abdominal area. Body movement epochs were detected by an innovative algorithm based on Hilbert transform. Data were collected from two healthy pregnant females during sleep for 7 weeks before parturition and 6 weeks after parturition. The pressure signal was used to determine the duration and time interval of maternal movements. Characteristics of the detected body movements before and after parturition were investigated through their proportion. The results showed that before and after parturition, the body movement which features as 0~1 min in interval and 0~6 sec in duration has significant difference statistically. It is considered that these differences are highly correlated with the prenatal activities.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Surface acoustic wave (SAW) vibration sensors.", "abstract": "In the paper a feasibility study on the use of surface acoustic wave (SAW) vibration sensors for electronic warning systems is presented. The system is assembled from concatenated SAW vibration sensors based on a SAW delay line manufactured on a surface of a piezoelectric plate. Vibrations of the plate are transformed into electric signals that allow identification of the sensor and localization of a threat. The theoretical study of sensor vibrations leads us to the simple isotropic model with one degree of freedom. This model allowed an explicit description of the sensor plate movement and identification of the vibrating sensor. Analysis of frequency response of the ST-cut quartz sensor plate and a damping speed of its impulse response has been conducted. The analysis above was the basis to determine the ranges of parameters for vibrating plates to be useful in electronic warning systems. Generally, operation of electronic warning systems with SAW vibration sensors is based on the analysis of signal phase changes at the working frequency of delay line after being transmitted via two circuits of concatenated four-terminal networks. Frequencies of phase changes are equal to resonance frequencies of vibrating plates of sensors. The amplitude of these phase changes is proportional to the amplitude of vibrations of a sensor plate. Both pieces of information may be sent and recorded jointly by a simple electrical unit.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2012-01-17", "authors": ["JerzyFilipiak", "LechSolarz", "GrzegorzSteczko"], "doi": "10.3390/s111211809"}
{"title": "Bonding and impedance matching of acoustic transducers using silver epoxy.", "abstract": "Silver epoxy was selected to bond transducer plates on glass substrates. The properties and thickness of the bonding medium affect the electrical input impedance of the transducer. Thus, the thickness of the silver epoxy bonding layer was used as a design parameter to optimize the structure for the transducer input impedance to match the 50 \u03a9 output impedance of most radio frequency (RF) generators. Simulation and experimental results show that nearly perfect matching is achieved without using any matching circuit. At the matching condition, the transducer operates at a frequency band a little bit below the half-wavelength resonant frequency of the piezoelectric plate. In experiments, lead titanate (PT) piezoelectric plates were employed. Both full-size, 11.5 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm, and half-size, 5.75 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm, can be well matched using optimal silver epoxy thickness. The transducer assemblies demonstrate high efficiency. The conversion loss from electrical power to acoustic power in soda-lime glass is 4.3 dB. This loss is low considering the fact that the transducers operate at off-resonance by 12%. With proper choice of silver epoxy thickness, the transducer can be matched at the fundamental, the 3rd and 5th harmonic frequencies. This leads to the possible realization of triple-band transducers. Reliability was assessed with thermal cycling test according to Telcordia GR-468-Core recommendation. Of the 30 transducer assemblies tested, none broke until 2900 cycles and 27 have sustained beyond 4050 cycles.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2012-01-14", "authors": ["Kyu TakSon", "Chin CLee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2011.11.010"}
{"title": "Green Synthesis of Fe and Fe/Pd Bimetallic Nanoparticles in Membranes for Reductive Degradation of Chlorinated Organics.", "abstract": "Membranes containing reactive nanoparticles (Fe and Fe/Pd) immobilized in a polymer film (polyacrylic acid, PAA-coated polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF membrane) are prepared by a new method. In the present work a biodegradable, non-toxic -\"green\" reducing agent, green tea extract was used for nanoparticle (NP) synthesis, instead of the well-known sodium borohydride. Green tea extract contains a number of polyphenols that can act as both chelating/reducing and capping agents for the nanoparticles. Therefore, the particles are protected from oxidation and aggregation, which increases their stability and longevity. The membrane supported NPs were successfully used for the degradation of a common and highly important pollutant, trichloroethylene (TCE). The rate of TCE degradation was found to increase linearly with the amount of Fe immobilized on the membrane, the surface normalized rate constant (k(SA)) being 0.005 L/m(2)h. The addition of a second catalytic metal, Pd, to form bimetallic Fe/Pd increased the k(SA) value to 0.008 L/m(2)h. For comparison purposes, Fe and Fe/Pd nanoparticles were synthesized in membranes using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent. Although the initial k(SA) values for this case (for Fe) are one order of magnitude higher than the tea extract synthesized NPs, the rapid oxidation reduced their reactivity to less than 20 % within 4 cycles. For the green tea extract NPs, the initial reactivity in the membrane domain was preserved even after 3 months of repeated use. The reactivity of TCE was verified with \"real\" water system.", "journal": "Journal of membrane science", "date": "2012-01-10", "authors": ["VSmuleac", "RVarma", "SSikdar", "DBhattacharyya"], "doi": "10.1016/j.memsci.2011.05.054"}

{"title": "Effect of membrane characteristics on the performance of membrane bioreactors for oily wastewater treatment.", "abstract": "Influence of membrane material and pore size on the performance of a submerged membrane bioreactor (sMBR) for oily wastewater treatment was investigated. The sMBR had a working volume of about 19 L with flat sheet modules at the same hydrodynamic conditions. Five types of micro- and ultra-polymeric membranes containing cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose nitrate (CN), polyamide (PA), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and polyethersulfone (PES) were used and their filtration performance in terms of permeability, permeate quality and fouling intensity were evaluated. Characterization of the membranes was done by performing some analysis such as pore size distribution; contact angle and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) microphotograph on all membranes. The quality of permeates from each membrane was identified by measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD). The results showed more irreversible fouling intensity for membranes with larger pore size which can be due to more permeation of bioparticles and colloids inside the pores. Membrane characteristics have a major role in the preliminary time of the filtration before cake layer formation so that the PA with the highest hydrophilicity had the lowest permeability decline by fouling in this period. Also, the PVDF and PES membranes had better performance according to better permeate quality in the preliminary time of the filtration related to smaller pore size and also their better fouling resistance and chemical stability properties. However, all membranes resulted in the same permeability and permeate quality after cake layer formation. An overall efficiency of about 95% in COD removal was obtained for oily wastewater treatment by the membranes used in this study.", "journal": "Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research", "date": "2012-01-05", "authors": ["SMafirad", "M RMehrnia", "M HSarrafzadeh"], "doi": "10.2166/wst.2011.754"}
{"title": "Facilitating high-force single-polysaccharide stretching using covalent attachment of one end of the chain.", "abstract": "Single polysaccharide force spectroscopy has yielded particularly interesting data, the interpretation of which requires the marriage of statistical-mechanical theories of polymer physics to the complexities afforded by possible force-induced conformational transitions of the constituent sugar rings. However, the difficulty of designing handles for the specific attachment of the different ends of polysaccharide chains to substrates, such as piezoelectric scanners, cantilevers or microbeads has meant that the majority of studies to date have been carried out with the polymer physisorbed to the substrates between which it is stretched, or at best chemically attached via bonds formed at uncontrolled locations along the length of the molecule. This means that the lengths of obtained polysaccharide stretches, as well as the forces that can be placed on the molecule without generating detachment, are generally smaller than those obtainable for polymers that offer the ability to be covalently attached to substrates specifically at their ends. As a consequence it is troublesome and tedious to record a statistically significant number of force curves that extend chains to high enough forces to investigate certain conformational transitions, such as the boat-to-inverted chair, exhibited by polysaccharides such as pectin. Herein, single molecule force-extension curves have been measured for the several pectin samples using AFM. The results are compared when either (1) the polymers have been physisorbed between the cantilever and the surface of the piezo-electric scanner, under several different solvent conditions of pH and ionic strength, or (2) the polymer molecule has been chemically attached at one end to the piezo surface using a recently reported coupling procedure. In fact, using such a chemical attachment to tether the end of the polysaccharide, reduced the frequency of successful stretching events obtained in a particular location, confirming the role of surface diffusion in the physisorbed experiments. Nevertheless, when polymer stretches were successfully recorded, the force that could be applied before detachment was significantly increased, indicating that this methodology has great potential for improving the acquisition of data reporting on force-induced conformational transitions of the sugar ring that require the application of significant stresses.", "journal": "Carbohydrate polymers", "date": "2012-01-04", "authors": ["AbdenorFellah", "NaserBelmiloud", "Richard GHaverkamp", "YacineHemar", "DonOtter", "Martin A KWilliams"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.073"}

Our study shows that estrone can be readily removed from water via a unique chemisorption mechanism using nylon microfiltration membranes. Experiments on a laboratory in-line filtration system showed instant removal of estrone from 200 \u03bcg/l aqueous solutions by 0.45-\u03bcm nylon membranes (ca. 35 L per m(2) membrane). Comparisons with 0.45-\u03bcm PVDF, PTFE and glass microfiber membranes suggested that the significant estrone adsorption in nylon membrane should be predominately driven by a different mechanism rather than common physical adsorption. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study on nylon membranes and a model compound, N-methylacetamide, showed that the significant adsorption originated from the hydrogen bonding between terminal -OH groups on estrone molecules and nucleophile -C=O groups in amide groups of nylon 6,6. The saturated nylon membrane showed very low leachability in ambient water, while it could be effectively regenerated in alkaline or ethanol solutions. Preliminary reusability study showed that the membrane maintained a consistent adsorption capacity for estrone during ten cycles of reuse.

{"title": "In vivo MRI visualization of mesh shrinkage using surgical implants loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxides.", "abstract": "Prosthetic mesh implants are widely used in hernia surgery. To show long-term mesh-related complications such as shrinkage or adhesions, a precise visualization of meshes and their vicinity in vivo is important. By supplementing mesh fibers with ferro particles, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to delineate the mesh itself. This study aimed to demonstrate and quantify time-dependent mesh shrinkage in vivo by MRI.\nPolyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) meshes with incorporated superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIOs) were implanted as an abdominal wall replacement in 30 rats. On days 1, 7, 14, or 21, MRI was performed using a gradient echo sequence with repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) of 50/4.6 and a flip angle of 20\u00b0. The length, width, and area of the device were measured on axial, coronal, and sagittal images, and geometric deformations were assessed by surgical explantation.\nIn all cases, the meshes were visualized and their area estimated by measuring the length and width of the mesh. The MRI presented a mean area shrinkage in vivo of 13% on day 7, 23% on day 14, and 23% on day 21. Postmortem measurements differed statistically from MRI, with a mean area shrinkage of 23% on day 7, 28% on day 14, and 30% on day 21. Ex vivo measurements of shrinkage showed in vivo measurements to be overestimated approximately 8%.

{"title": "3D kinematic and dynamic analysis of the front crawl tumble turn in elite male swimmers.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify kinematic and dynamic variables related to the best tumble turn times (3mRTT, the turn time from 3-m in to 3-m out, independent variable) in ten elite male swimmers using a three-dimensional (3D) underwater analysis protocol and the Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) as statistical method. For each swimmer, the best-time turn was analyzed with five stationary and synchronized underwater cameras. The 3D reconstruction was performed using the Direct Linear Transformation algorithm. An underwater piezoelectric 3D force platform completed the set-up to compute dynamic variables. Data were smoothed by the Savitzky-Golay filtering method. Three variables were considered relevant in the best Lasso model (3mRTT=2.58-0.425 RD+0.204 VPe+0.0046 TD): the head-wall distance where rotation starts (RD), the horizontal speed at the force peak (VPe), and the 3D length of the path covered during the turn (TD). Furthermore, bivariate analysis showed that upper body (CUBei) and lower limb extension indexes at first contact (CLLei) were also linked to the turn time (r=-0.65 and p<0.05 for both variables). Thus the best turn times were associated with a long RD, slower VPe and reduced TD. By an early transverse rotation, male elite swimmers reach the wall with a slightly flexed posture that results in fast extension. These swimmers opt for a movement that is oriented forward and they focus on reducing the distance covered.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2011-12-20", "authors": ["FPuel", "JMorlier", "MAvalos", "MMesnard", "MCid", "PHellard"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.11.043"}

{"title": "Optimization of sensing and feedback control for vibration/flutter of rotating disk by PZT actuators via air coupled pressure.", "abstract": "In this paper, a feedback control mechanism and its optimization for rotating disk vibration/flutter via changes of air-coupled pressure generated using piezoelectric patch actuators are studied. A thin disk rotates in an enclosure, which is equipped with a feedback control loop consisting of a micro-sensor, a signal processor, a power amplifier, and several piezoelectric (PZT) actuator patches distributed on the cover of the enclosure. The actuator patches are mounted on the inner or the outer surfaces of the enclosure to produce necessary control force required through the airflow around the disk. The control mechanism for rotating disk flutter using enclosure surfaces bonded with sensors and piezoelectric actuators is thoroughly studied through analytical simulations. The sensor output is used to determine the amount of input to the actuator for controlling the response of the disk in a closed loop configuration. The dynamic stability of the disk-enclosure system, together with the feedback control loop, is analyzed as a complex eigenvalue problem, which is solved using Galerkin's discretization procedure. The results show that the disk flutter can be reduced effectively with proper configurations of the control gain and the phase shift through the actuations of PZT patches. The effectiveness of different feedback control methods in altering system characteristics and system response has been investigated. The control capability, in terms of control gain, phase shift, and especially the physical configuration of actuator patches, are also evaluated by calculating the complex eigenvalues and the maximum displacement produced by the actuators.

{"title": "Contribution of complex stapes motion to cochlea activation.", "abstract": "Classic theories of hearing have considered only a translational component (piston-like component) of the stapes motion as being the effective stimulus for cochlear activation and thus the sensation of hearing. Our previous study (Huber et al., 2008) qualitatively showed that rotational components around the long and short axes of the footplate (rocking-like components) lead to cochlear activation as well. In this study, the contribution of the piston-like and rocking-like components of the stapes motion to cochlea activation was quantitatively investigated with measurements in live guinea pigs and a related mathematical description. The isolated stapes in anesthetized guinea pigs was stimulated by a three-axis piezoelectric actuator, and 3-D motions of the stapes and compound action potential (CAP) of the cochlea were measured simultaneously. The measured values were used to fit a hypothesis of the CAP as a linear combination of the logarithms of the piston-like and rocking-like components. Both the piston-like and rocking-like components activate cochlear responses when they exceed certain thresholds. These thresholds as well as the relation between CAP and intensity of the motion component were different for piston-like and rocking-like components. The threshold was found to be higher and the sensitivity lower for the rocking-like component than the corresponding values for the piston-like component. The influence of the rocking-like component was secondary in cases of piston-dominant motions of the stapes although it may become significant for low amplitudes of the piston-like component.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["AlbrechtEiber", "Alexander MHuber", "MichaelLauxmann", "MichailChatzimichalis", "DamienSequeira", "Jae HoonSim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2011.11.008"}

For the ternary nickel plating processes, the effects of 3d transition metals including Fe(II), Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) on Ni(II) adsorption were evaluated. The influences of the aforementioned coexistent cations and organic acids were elucidated by the continuum solvation model (COSMO)-corrected density functional theory (DFT) method.

It was found that the adsorption capacities of random copolymers on PVDF membranes were all higher than those of block copolymers. However, the specific and overall protein resistance of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on PVDF membranes coated with block copolymers was much higher than that with random copolymers. The increase in styrene content in copolymer increased the amount of polymer coating on the membrane, and the increase in PEGMA content enhanced the protein resistance of membranes. The optimum PS/PEGMA ratio was found to be close to 2 for the best resistance of protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion on the PEGylated diblock copolymer-coated membranes.

{"title": "Novel phage amplified multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal sensor for rapid and sensitive detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "abstract": "The key factors that control the spread and mortality rate of tuberculosis (TB) are rapid detection and diagnosis. However, the current detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) cannot meet the recommended requirements for clinical diagnosis in turnaround time. In this paper, the feature of phage D29 that infects M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) was combined with the sensitivity of multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal sensor (MSPQC) to detect M. tuberculosis. The phage D29 played a role of inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. M. tuberculosis is used to protect phage D29 from being killed by ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) and carries phage D29 into the detection medium containing M. smegmatis. The action of M. smegmatis indicated the existence state of phage D29 in the detection medium. The growth curve of M. smegmatis obtained by MSPQC indicated the state of the growth of M. tuberculosis.

{"title": "Compensator design for improved counterbalancing in high speed atomic force microscopy.", "abstract": "High speed atomic force microscopy can provide the possibility of many new scientific observations and applications ranging from nano-manufacturing to the study of biological processes. However, the limited imaging speed has been an imperative drawback of the atomic force microscopes. One of the main reasons behind this limitation is the excitation of the AFM dynamics at high scan speeds, severely undermining the reliability of the acquired images. In this research, we propose a piezo based, feedforward controlled, counter actuation mechanism to compensate for the excited out-of-plane scanner dynamics. For this purpose, the AFM controller output is properly filtered via a linear compensator and then applied to a counter actuating piezo. An effective algorithm for estimating the compensator parameters is developed. The information required for compensator design is extracted from the cantilever deflection signal, hence eliminating the need for any additional sensors. The proposed approach is implemented and experimentally evaluated on the dynamic response of a custom made AFM. It is further assessed by comparing the imaging performance of the AFM with and without the application of the proposed technique and in comparison with the conventional counterbalancing methodology.

We have been developing a variable-focus liquid lens that employs acoustic radiation force and does not contain any mechanical moving parts. Our liquid lens is more compact and has a faster response than conventional mechanical lenses. Rapid scanning of its focus at 1 kHz has been realized by excitation with an amplitude-modulation (AM) signal. The liquid lens consists of a cylindrical acrylic cell (inner diameter: 10 mm; thickness: 3 mm), two immiscible liquids with different refractive indices (water and silicone oil), and an annular piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate transducer with four electrodes. The oil-water interface functions as a lens surface and it can be deformed by the acoustic radiation force generated by the transducer; this enables the lens to act as a variable-focus lens. The variation of the oil-water interface was observed by optical coherence tomography. The laser beam path through the lens was calculated by ray-tracing simulations. The oil-water interface could be deformed and its focal point could be varied in three dimensions by controlling the input voltages of the PZT electrodes. The displacement angle in the radial direction was approximately 3\u00b0 when two of the electrodes were excited by an input voltage of 45 V at a frequency of 1.9 MHz.

{"title": "Study and comparison of different EMAT configurations for SH wave inspection.", "abstract": "Guided wave inspection has proven to be a very effective method for the rapid inspection of large structures. The fundamental shear horizontal (SH) wave mode in plates and the torsional mode in pipe-like structures are especially useful because of their non-dispersive character. Guided waves can be generated by either piezoelectric transducers or electro- magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), and EMATs can be based on either the Lorentz force or magnetostriction. Several EMAT configurations can be used to produce SH waves, the most common being Lorentz-force periodic permanent magnet and magnetostrictive EMATs, the latter being directly applied on the sample or with a bonded strip of highly magnetostrictive material on the plate. This paper compares the performance of these solutions on steel structures. To quantitatively assess the wave amplitude produced by different probes, a finite element model of the elementary transducers has been developed. The results of the model are experimentally validated and the simulations are further used to study the dependence of ultrasonic wave amplitude on key design parameters. The analysis shows that magnetostrictive EMATs directly applied on mild steel plates have comparatively poor performance that is dependent on the precise magneto-mechanical properties of the test object. Periodic permanent magnet EMATs generate intermediate wave amplitudes and are noncontact and insensitive to the variations in properties seen across typical steels. Large signal amplitudes can be achieved with magnetostrictive EMATs with a layer of highly magnetostrictive material attached between the transducer and the plate, but this compromises the noncontact nature of the transducer.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2011-12-01", "authors": ["RemoRibichini", "FredericCegla", "Peter BNagy", "PeterCawley"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2120"}

PVDF sensors are especially preferred over conventional strain gauges in active vibration control because the PVDF sensors are easy to cut into different sizes or shapes as piezoelectric actuators and they can then be placed as collocated pairs. In this work, to focus on demonstrating the dynamic sensing performance of the PVDF film sensor, we revisit the active vibration control problem of a cantilever beam using a collocated lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuator/PVDF film sensor pair. Before applying active vibration control, the measurement characteristics of the PVDF film sensor are studied by simultaneous comparison with a strain gauge. The loading effect of the piezoelectric actuator on the cantilever beam is also investigated in this paper. Finally, four simple, robust active vibration controllers are employed with the collocated PZT/PVDF pair to suppress vibration of the cantilever beam subjected to impact loadings. The four controllers are the velocity feedback controller, the integral resonant controller (IRC), the resonant controller, and the positive position feedback (PPF) controller.

{"title": "Time-resolved study of the mechanical response of tissue phantoms to nanosecond laser pulses.", "abstract": "We present a time-resolved study of the interaction of nanosecond laser pulses with tissue phantoms. When a laser pulse interacts with a material, optical energy is absorbed by a combination of linear (heat generation and thermoelastic expansion) and nonlinear absorption (expanding plasma), according to both the laser light irradiance and material properties. The objective is to elucidate the contribution of linear and nonlinear optical absorption to bubble formation. Depending on the local temperatures and pressures reached, both interactions may lead to the formation of bubbles. We discuss three experimental approaches: piezoelectric sensors, time-resolved shadowgraphy, and time-resolved interferometry, to follow the formation of bubbles and measure the pressure originated by 6 ns laser pulses interacting with tissue phantoms. We studied the bubble formation and pressure transients for varying linear optical absorption and for radiant exposures above and below threshold for bubble formation. We report a rapid decay (of 2 orders of magnitude) of the laser-induced mechanical pressure measured (by time-resolved shadowgraphy) very close to the irradiation spot and beyond 1 mm from the irradiation site (by the piezoelectric sensor). Through time-resolved interferometry measurements, we determined that bubble formation can occur at marginal temperature increments as low as 3\u00b0C.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "date": "2011-11-25", "authors": ["Francisco GP\u00e9rez-Guti\u00e9rrez", "SantiagoCamacho-L\u00f3pez", "GuillermoAguilar"], "doi": "10.1117/1.3644380"}

Establishing a uniform state of stress in the sample is a fundamental requirement for this type of high-rate testing. Input pulse shaping was utilized to tailor and control the ramping of the incident loading pulse such that a uniform stress state could be maintained within the specimen from the start of the test. Direct experimental verification of the stress uniformity in the sample was obtained via comparison of the force measured by piezoelectric quartz force gages on both the input and the output sides of the shear specimen. The technique was demonstrated for shear loading of silicone gel biosimulant materials and porcine brain tissue. Finite element simulations were utilized to further investigate the effect of pulse shaping on the loading rate and rise time. Simulations also provided a means for visualization of the degree of shear stress and strain uniformity in the specimen during an experiment.

To elucidate the bond strength of individual linkages the unbinding forces of UAT supramolecular polymers were investigated for the first time. The bond rupture was probed at three different, fixed piezo retraction rates in far from equilibrium conditions. The number of supramolecular bonds (N) between AFM tip and the surface was determined by independent knowledge of the linker length. The observed rupture force of urea-aminotriazine (UAT)-based supramolecular polymer chains was found to decrease with increasing rupture length. The dependence of the most probable rupture force on N was in quantitative agreement with the theory of uncooperative bond rupture for supramolecular linkages switched in series. Experiments with three different, fixed loading rates provided identical values (within the experimental error) for the characteristic bond length x(\u03b2) and the off-rate constant in the absence of force k(off)(f = 0). The value of x(\u03b2) was found to agree with literature data on the hydrogen-bond distance obtained via crystallographic data of the hydrogen-bonded dimer.

A semi-empirical computer model utilized the hyperbolic propagation operator to predict the nonlinear pressure field and provide the complex frequency response of the corresponding source transducer. The PVDF hydrophone phase characteristics, which were obtained directly from the difference between the computer-modeled nonlinear field simulation and the corresponding measured harmonic frequency phase values, agree to within 10% with the phase predictions obtained from receive-transfer-function simulations based on software modeling of the membrane's physical properties. Cable loading effects and membrane hydrophone resonances were distinguished and identified through a series of impedance measurements and receive transfer function simulations on the hydrophones including their hard-wired coaxial cables. The results obtained indicate that the PVDF membrane hydrophone's phase versus frequency plot exhibits oscillations about a monotonically decreasing line. The maxima and minima inflection point slopes occur at the membrane thickness resonances and antiresonances, respectively.

These included polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) spot-poled membrane, needle, and capsule designs. One needle hydrophone was designed for high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) applications. The average reproducibility (after repositioning the hydrophone) of the phase measurement was 2.4\u00b0. The minimum-phase model, which implies that the phase response is equal to the inverse Hilbert transform of the natural logarithm of the magnitude response, was tested with TDS hydrophone data. Direct TDS-based measurements of hydrophone phase responses agreed well with calculations based on the minimum-phase model, with rms differences of 1.76\u00b0 (PVDF spot-poled membrane hydrophone), 3.10\u00b0 (PVDF capsule hydrophone), 3.43\u00b0 (PVDF needle hydrophone), and 3.36\u00b0 (ceramic needle hydrophone) over the range from 5 to 18 MHz.

{"title": "Induction of coherent magnetization switching in a few atomic layers of FeCo using voltage pulses.", "abstract": "The magnetization direction of a metallic magnet has generally been controlled by a magnetic field or by spin-current injection into nanosized magnetic cells. Both these methods use an electric current to control the magnetization direction; therefore, they are energy consuming. Magnetization control using an electric field is considered desirable because of its expected ultra-low power consumption and coherent behaviour. Previous experimental approaches towards achieving voltage control of magnetization switching have used single ferromagnetic layers with and without piezoelectric materials, ferromagnetic semiconductors, multiferroic materials, and their hybrid systems. However, the coherent control of magnetization using voltage signals has not thus far been realized. Also, bistable magnetization switching (which is essential in information storage) possesses intrinsic difficulties because an electric field does not break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we demonstrate a coherent precessional magnetization switching using electric field pulses in nanoscale magnetic cells with a few atomic FeCo (001) epitaxial layers adjacent to a MgO barrier. Furthermore, we demonstrate the realization of bistable toggle switching using the coherent precessions.

The simulated velocity vector followed a spiral vortex flow field with an average direction outward from the center of the transducers. These vortices caused the lower signal intensity in the middle of the microarray for the two-piezoelectric disk design. On the contrary, the problem almost disappeared in the three-piezoelectric-disk system.

{"title": "Quantitative force and dissipation measurements in liquids using piezo-excited atomic force microscopy: a unifying theory.", "abstract": "The use of a piezoelectric element (acoustic excitation) to vibrate the base of microcantilevers is a popular method for dynamic atomic force microscopy. In air or vacuum, the base motion is so small (relative to tip motion) that it can be neglected. However, in liquid environments the base motion can be large and cannot be neglected. Yet it cannot be directly observed in most AFMs. Therefore, in liquids, quantitative force and energy dissipation spectroscopy with acoustic AFM relies on theoretical formulae and models to estimate the magnitude of the base motion. However, such formulae can be inaccurate due to several effects. For example, a significant component of the piezo excitation does not mechanically excite the cantilever but rather transmits acoustic waves through the surrounding liquid, which in turn indirectly excites the cantilever. Moreover, resonances of the piezo, chip and holder can obscure the true cantilever dynamics even in well-designed liquid cells. Although some groups have tried to overcome these limitations (either by theory modification or better design of piezos and liquid cells), it is generally accepted that acoustic excitation is unsuitable for quantitative force and dissipation spectroscopy in liquids. In this paper the authors present a careful study of the base motion and excitation forces and propose a method by which quantitative analysis is in fact possible, thus opening this popular method for quantitative force and dissipation spectroscopy using dynamic AFM in liquids. This method is validated by experiments in water on mica using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which can measure the actual base motion. Finally, the method is demonstrated by using small-amplitude dynamic AFM to extract the force gradients and dissipation on solvation shells of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) molecules on mica.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2011-11-11", "authors": ["DanielKiracofe", "ArvindRaman"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/22/48/485502"}

The efficiencies of lipases immobilized on these membranes with different hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties were compared. The lipase immobilized on hydrophobic PVDF-DA-GA membrane exhibited more than an 11-fold increase in activity compared to its immobilization on a hydrophilic RC-DA-GA membrane. The relationship between surface hydrophobicity and immobilized efficiencies was investigated using hydrophobic/hydrophilic GF membranes which were prepared by grafting a different ratio of n-butylamine/1,4-diaminobutane (BA/DA). The immobilized lipase activity on the GF membrane increased with the increased BA/DA ratio. This means that lipase activity was exhibited more on the hydrophobic surface. Moreover, the modified PVDF-DA membrane was grafted with GA, epichlorohydrin (EPI) and cyanuric chloride (CC), respectively. The lipase immobilized on the PVDF-DA-EPI membrane displayed the highest specific activity compared to other membranes. This immobilized lipase exhibited more significant stability on pH, thermal, reuse, and storage than did the free enzyme. The results exhibited that the EPI modified PVDF is a promising support for lipase immobilization.", "journal": "Journal of bioscience and bioengineering", "date": "2011-11-11", "authors": ["Guan-JieChen", "Chia-HungKuo", "Chih-IChen", "Chung-ChengYu", "Chwen-JenShieh", "Yung-ChuanLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.09.023"}
{"title": "Compression of cross-linked poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoro ethylene) films for facile ferroelectric polarization.", "abstract": "In this study, we demonstrated a facile route for enhancing the ferroelectric polarization of a chemically cross-linked poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoro ethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) film. Our method is based on thermally induced cross-linking of a PVDF-TrFE film with a 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine (THDA) agent under compression. The remanent polarization (P(r)) of a metal/ferroelectric/metal capacitor containing a cross-linked PVDF-TrFE film increased with pressure up to a certain value, whereas no change in the P(r) value was observed in the absence of THDA. A film cross-linked with 10 wt % THDA with respect to PVDF-TrFE under a pressure of 100 kPa exhibited a P(r) of approximately 5.61 \u03bcC/cm(2), which is 1.6 times higher than that in the absence of pressure. The enhanced ferroelectric polarization was attributed to highly ordered 20-nm-thick edge-on crystalline lamellae whose c-axes are aligned parallel to the substrate. The lamellae were effective for ferroelectric switching of the PVDF-TrFE when a cross-linked film was recrystallized under pressure. Furthermore, compression of a PVDF-TrFE film with a topographically prepatterned poly(dimethyl siloxane) mold gave rise to a chemically cross-linked micropattern in which edge-on crystalline lamellae were globally oriented over a very large area.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2011-11-11", "authors": ["Yu JinShin", "Richard HahnkeeKim", "Hee JoonJung", "Seok JuKang", "Youn JungPark", "InsungBae", "CheolminPark"], "doi": "10.1021/am201202w"}

{"title": "Measuring neuronal population activity using 3D laser scanning.", "abstract": "Neural tissue is organized in three-dimensional (3D) networks of neuronal and glial cell populations. To understand the functional organization of these networks, it is desirable to achieve 3D activity measurements from large cell populations in intact tissue with high temporal resolution. Repeated acquisition of image stacks with standard laser-scanning microscopes is too slow. This protocol describes fast 3D calcium imaging in the living brain using mechanical laser scanning with standard galvanometric mirrors and a piezoelectric focusing element. The purpose of 3D laser scanning is to create a 3D line scan that samples relatively homogenously from a particular observation volume. The spatial resolution of this approach is low, except along the line. However, the main goal is not to resolve subcellular structures, but rather to hit as many cell bodies as possible within the volume. In this manner, local network activity can be inferred from the somatic calcium signals of a significant fraction of the cell population. With a sinusoidal swinging microscope objective as a constraint, 3D scan trajectories are generated that sample fluorescence signals from the majority of cells within a cuboidal volume. Measurements with 10-Hz temporal resolution can be achieved for population calcium signals from several hundreds of identified neurons and glial cells within cuboids with side lengths of \u223c250 \u00b5m.

Most piezoelectric MEMS resonant sensors are acoustic sensors (with specific coating layers) that enable selective and label-free detection of biological events in real time. These label-free technologies have recently garnered significant attention for their sensitive and quantitative multi-parameter analysis of biological systems. Since piezoelectric MEMS resonant sensors do more than transform analyte mass or thickness into an electrical signal (e.g., frequency and impedance), special attention must be paid to their potential beyond microweighing, such as measuring elastic and viscous properties, and several types of sensors currently under development operate at different resonant modes (i.e., thickness extensional mode, thickness shear mode, lateral extensional mode, flexural mode, etc.).

It was found that BCECs were inhibited to attach onto the PVA surface. Conversely, relatively more hydrophobic biomaterials EVAL, TCPS, and PVDF successfully initiate BCEC adhesion. Compared to EVAL, cultured BCECs on TCPS and PVDF exhibited higher viability. Furthermore, fibroblastic transformation on EVAL and TCPS was observed at day 17, but BCECs maintained typical hexagonal shape on the PVDF surface at day 21. This phenomenon can be rescued by previously coating type IV collagen on TCPS but not on EVAL. In addition, when BCECs were cultured on PVDF, the expressions of gap junction connexin-43, differentiation marker N-cadherin, and tight junction ZO-1 were well-developed, resembling the physiological phenotypes. After examining the type IV collagen expression by Western blot analysis and protein absorption test, a possible explanation for the better proliferation and preservation of BCECs on the PVDF substrate is that PVDF is a bioactive substratum which enables BCECs to synthesize and reserve more extracellular matrix type IV collagen, paving an important way to provide a more preferential environment for BCEC cultures.

We predict that, for typical geometries and donor concentrations, the length of the NW does not significantly influence the maximum output piezopotential because the potential mainly drops across the tip, so that relatively short NWs can be sufficient for high-efficiency nanogenerators, which is an important result for wet-chemistry fabrication of low-cost, CMOS- or MEMS-compatible nanogenerators.

However, the implantation of meshes is related to an inflammatory foreign body reaction (FBR) with serious complications (i.e., persistent seroma, wound infection, mesh migration, entrapment, chronic pain). Adrenal hormones profoundly modify inflammatory response. Their effects on FBR however, remain ill defined. We therefore studied the FBR to polyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) mesh material that was coated with four different substances: hydrocortisone (COR) or mifepristone (MIF), which respectively stimulate and block the glucocorticoid receptor, and aldosterone (ALD) or spironolactone (SPI), which respectively stimulate and block the mineralocorticoid receptor. The coated substances were released from the meshes within 24 h. Seven, 21, and 90 days after implantation, the specimen was evaluated for collagen formation, granuloma size, inflammatory activity, and angiogenesis. COR and SPI coating protected from inflammatory response, while ALD and MIF coating showed little difference to the control group. The COR and SPI groups showed smaller granuloma sizes at all time points, as well as a reduced number of inflammatory cells (p < 0.001) at day 90, and decreased collagen formation starting after 21 days (p < 0.05). There was a negative correlation for angiogenesis with inflammation around foreign body structures.

The influence of three types of natural organic matters on the modified membrane fouling was also studied. Raw water was taken from two different locations, i.e., Harbin and Zhaoyuan, of Songhua River. Dissolved organic compounds in the raw water were fractionated using XAD resins into three fractions, i.e., hydrophobic fraction, transphilic fraction, and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The three adsorbed compounds were further eluted and dissolved into distilled water respectively to prepare the feed for the fouling tests. All solutions were adjusted to a concentration of 10.6 mg C/L, which equals to the total organic carbon (TOC) of the raw water. Results show that the addition of nano-Al\u2082O\u2083 particulars did not affect the inherent traits of the PVDF membranes, however, its surface hydrophilic properties were improved significantly with the addition of nanoparticles and anti-fouling performance was enhanced as well.

This system drastically increases the number of ion channels that can be studied, as multiple ion channel experiments can now be conducted in parallel. However, due to tedious, usually pressure-driven mechanotransduction techniques, there has been a slow integration of this technology into the field of mechanosensitive ion channels. By implementing a piezoelectric quartz substrate into a planar patch clamp system, we show that the patch clamp substrate itself can be used to mechanically actuate ion channels. The piezoelectric substrate transduces an external, applied electric field into a mechanical tension, so precise actuation of the membrane can be accomplished. By applying this electric field only to the outer edges of the substrate, no ulterior electric field is created in the vicinity of the membrane during actuation. Further, with resonant frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 200 MHz, quartz substrates can be used to apply a wide range of time-varying tensions to cell membranes. This will allow for new and instructive investigations into the dynamic mechanotransductive properties of ion channels.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2011-10-22", "authors": ["EricStava", "MinruiYu", "Hyun CheolShin", "HyuncheolShin", "JonathanRodriguez", "Robert HBlick"], "doi": "10.1039/c1lc20636b"}

{"title": "Relation between EPS adherence, viscoelastic properties, and MBR operation: Biofouling study with QCM-D.", "abstract": "Membrane fouling is one of the main constraints of the wide use of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology. The biomass in MBR systems includes extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), metabolic products of active microbial secretion that adversely affect the membrane performance. Solids retention time (SRT) in the MBR is one of the most important parameters affecting membrane fouling in MBR systems, where fouling is minimized at optimal SRT. Among the operating parameters in MBR systems, SRT is known to strongly influence the ratio of proteins to polysaccharides in the EPS matrix. In this study, we have direct evidence for changes in EPS adherence and viscoelastic properties due to changes in the sludge removal rate that strongly correlate with the membrane fouling rate and EPS composition. EPS were extracted from a UF membrane in a hybrid growth MBR operated at sludge removal rates of 59, 35.4, 17.7, and 5.9\u00a0L\u00a0day(-1) (corresponding SRT of 3, 5, 10, and 30 days, respectively). The EPS adherence and adsorption kinetics were carried out in a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technology in several adsorption measurements to a gold sensor coated with Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF). EPS adsorption to the sensor surface is characterized by a decrease of the oscillation frequency and an increase in the dissipation energy of the sensor during parallel flow of aqueous media, supplemented with EPS, above the sensor surface. The results from these experiments were further modeled using the Voigt based model, in which the thickness, shear modulus, and shear viscosity values of the adsorbed EPS layers on the PVDF crystal were calculated. The observations in the QCM-D suggested that the elevated fouling of the UF membrane is due to higher adherence of the EPS as well as reduction in viscosity and elasticity of the EPS adsorbed layer and elevation of the EPS fluidity. These results corroborate with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) image analysis showing thicker EPS in close proximity to the membrane surface operated at reactor conditions which induced more fouling at elevated sludge removal rates.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2011-10-22", "authors": ["AmerSweity", "WangYing", "Mohammed SAli-Shtayeh", "FeiYang", "AmosBick", "GideonOron", "MosheHerzberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2011.09.038"}

A poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) film was surface modified by dip coating in an aqueous solution of dopamine on the basis of its self-polymerization and strong adhesion feature. The self-polymerization and deposition rates of dopamine on film surfaces increased with increasing temperature as evaluated by both spectroscopic ellipsometry and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Changes in the surface morphologies of pDA-coated films as well as the size and shape of pDA particles in the solution were also investigated by SEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface roughness and surface free energy of pDA-modified films were mainly affected by the reaction temperature and showed only a slight dependence on the reaction time and concentration of the dopamine solution. Additionally, three other typical hydrophobic polymer films of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and polyimide (PI) were also modified by the same procedure. The lyophilicity (liquid affinity) and surface free energy of these polymer films were enhanced significantly after being coated with pDA, as were those of PVDF films. It is indicated that the deposition behavior of pDA is not strongly dependent on the nature of the substrates.

A miniscrew was inserted into the bony window to support the elevated sinus membrane. In the second group, anorganic bovine graft (Bio-Oss) was grafted after very careful elevation of the sinus membrane. Collagen membrane was placed over the bone graft. Rabbits were sacrificed after 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. The augmented sinuses were evaluated by immunochemical analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), type I collagen, and osteocalcin content.\nImmunochemically positive cells for PCNA were present along the floor of the replaced bony window and the elevated sinus membrane from 1 to 4 weeks in the graftless group. In the grafted group, immunochemically positive cells for PCNA were not present after 1 week. In the ungrafted group, the expression of type I collagen was present from week 1. However, the expression of type I collagen was present after 2 weeks in the grafted group. Osteocalcin was observed in both groups after 1 week. Osteocalcin was observed along the floor of the replaced bony window in the graftless group but was not observed along the collagen membrane in the grafted group.\nAccording to this immunochemical study, faster and greater new bone formation was observed in sites that received no grafting material.

The probe was then moved using a piezo-actuator to completely detach the cell. The detachment forces were calculated and analyzed statistically for three different groups of implant disks: a titanium (Ti) grit-blasted (TiOblast) surface (n = 15, group 1), a fluoride-modified (OsseoSpeed) surface (n = 15, group 2), and a machined titanium surface (n = 6, group 3).\nThe detachment force was slightly higher for the OsseoSpeed surface than the TiOblast surface, but this difference was not statistically significant. The detachment force on the machined surface was statistically significantly lower than that seen in the other groups, thus supporting the rationale that changes in surface properties would be reflected in the measured detachment force. The OsseoSpeed and TiOblast surfaces demonstrated stronger osteoblast adhesion compared to the machined titanium surface.\nWithin the limitations of this study, this report is a good proof-of-principle for the application of cytodetachment technology to testing implant surfaces.

In this study, three-phase composites comprising poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles, and \u03b2-silicon carbide (\u03b2-SiC) whiskers were prepared. The superiority of this method is that, when compared with the two-phase PVDF/BT composites, three-phase composites not only show significantly increased dielectric constants but also have higher thermal conductivity.

A new classification system that details the type of signals measured by these devices is presented. This proposed system categorizes OOC devices based on measurements of Sleep, Cardiovascular, Oximetry, Position, Effort, and Respiratory (SCOPER) parameters.Criteria for evaluating the devices are also presented, which were generated from chosen pre-test and post-test probabilities. These criteria state that in patients with a high pretest probability of having OSA, the OOC testing device has a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 5 or greater coinciding with an in-lab-polysomnography (PSG)-generated apnea hypopnea index (AHI) \u2265 5, and an adequate sensitivity (at least 0.825).Since oximetry is a mandatory signal for scoring AHI using PSG, devices that do not incorporate oximetry were excluded. English peer-reviewed literature on FDA-approved devices utilizing more than 1 signal was reviewed according to the above criteria for 6 questions. These questions specifically addressed the adequacy of different respiratory and effort sensors and combinations thereof to diagnose OSA. In summary, the literature is currently inadequate to state with confidence that a thermistor alone without any effort sensor is adequate to diagnose OSA; if a thermal sensing device is used as the only measure of respiration, 2 effort belts are required as part of the montage and piezoelectric belts are acceptable in this context; nasal pressure can be an adequate measurement of respiration with no effort measure with the caveat that this may be device specific; nasal pressure may be used in combination with either 2 piezoelectric or respiratory inductance plethysmographic (RIP) belts (but not 1 piezoelectric belt); and there is insufficient evidence to state that both nasal pressure and thermistor are required to adequately diagnose OSA. With respect to alternative devices for diagnosing OSA, the data indicate that peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) devices are adequate for the proposed use; the device based on cardiac signals shows promise, but more study is required as it has not been tested in the home setting; for the device based on end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), it appears to be adequate for a hospital population; and for devices utilizing acoustic signals, the data are insufficient to determine whether the use of acoustic signals with other signals as a substitute for airflow is adequate to diagnose OSA.Standardized research is needed on OOC devices that report LR+ at the appropriate AHI (\u2265 5) and scored according to the recommended definitions, while using appropriate research reporting and methodology to minimize bias.", "journal": "Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine", "date": "2011-10-18", "authors": ["Nancy ACollop", "Sharon LTracy", "VisheshKapur", "ReenaMehra", "DavidKuhlmann", "Sam AFleishman", "Joseph MOjile"], "doi": "10.5664/JCSM.1328"}

{"title": "Uncertainty quantification in nanomechanical measurements using the atomic force microscope.", "abstract": "Quantifying uncertainty in measured properties of nanomaterials is a prerequisite for the manufacture of reliable nanoengineered materials and products. Yet, rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) is rarely applied for material property measurements with the atomic force microscope (AFM), a widely used instrument that can measure properties at nanometer scale resolution of both inorganic and biological surfaces and nanomaterials. We present a framework to ascribe uncertainty to local nanomechanical properties of any nanoparticle or surface measured with the AFM by taking into account the main uncertainty sources inherent in such measurements. We demonstrate the framework by quantifying uncertainty in AFM-based measurements of the transverse elastic modulus of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), an abundant, plant-derived nanomaterial whose mechanical properties are comparable to Kevlar fibers. For a single, isolated CNC the transverse elastic modulus was found to have a mean of 8.1\u00a0GPa and a 95% confidence interval of 2.7-20\u00a0GPa. A key result is that multiple replicates of force-distance curves do not sample the important sources of uncertainty, which are systematic in nature. The dominant source of uncertainty is the nondimensional photodiode sensitivity calibration rather than the cantilever stiffness or Z-piezo calibrations.

We show for the first time that the spotted protein micropatterns remain stable on the PEG surface even after extensive washing, thus significantly simplifying protein pattern formation. We found that adherence and spreading of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts was confined to PLL and collagen areas of the micropatterns. In contrast, primary rat hepatocytes adhered and spread only on collagen micropatterns, where they formed uniform, well defined functionally active cell arrays.

Several IB composites were fabricated with different commercial and experimental piezoelectric ceramics and evaluated to determine a suitable formulation for use in high-frequency linear arrays. It was found that the fabricated fine-scale 2-2 IB composites outperformed 1-3 IB composites with identical pillar- and kerf-widths. This result was not expected and lead to the conclusion that dicing damage was likely the cause of the discrepancy. Ultimately, a 2-2 composite fabricated using a fine-grain piezoelectric ceramic was chosen for the array. The composite was manufactured using one IB operation in the azimuth direction to produce approximately 19-\u03bcm-wide pillars separated by 6-\u03bcm-wide kerfs. The array had a 50 \u03bcm (one wavelength in water) azimuth pitch, two matching layers, and 2 mm elevation length focused to 7.3 mm using a polymethylpentene (TPX) lens. The measured pulse-echo center frequency for a representative array element was 28 MHz and -6-dB bandwidth was 61%. The measured single-element transmit -6-dB directivity was estimated to be 50\u00b0. The measured insertion loss was 19 dB after compensating for the effects of attenuation and diffraction in the water bath. A fine-wire phantom was used to assess the lateral and axial resolution of the array when paired with a prototype system utilizing a 64-channel analog beamformer. The -6-dB lateral and axial resolutions were estimated to be 125 and 68 \u03bcm, respectively. An anechoic cyst phantom was also imaged to determine the minimum detectable spherical inclusion, and thus the 3-D resolution of the array and beamformer.

{"title": "Acoustic, piezoelectric, and dielectric nonlinearities of AlN in coupled resonator filters for high RF power levels.", "abstract": "Coupled resonator filters (CRFs) are the new generation of BAW filters recently designed for the front-end modules of mobile transmission systems. Looking for designers' requirements, CRF devices have been characterized and modeled. The model based on equivalent circuits relies on material constants such as stiffness and electro-coupling coefficients, and works only for linear-mode propagation. Because of their positions between antennas and power amplifiers, they often work under high RF power, inducing nonlinear response in the AlN piezoelectric layer. In this work, we analyze for the first time the nonlinear behavior of AlN material particularly for coupled BAW resonators. To characterize the nonlinear effects in CRFs, we measure the 1-dB gain compression point (P1dB) and the intercept point (IP(3)). Then, we develop a nonlinear model of CRFs using harmonic balance (HB) simulation in commercially available software. The HB environment allows fitting simulations to measurements in terms of P(1dB) and IP(3). We find that a high RF power induces nonlinear changes in the material constants' real parts: elastic stiffness c(33) (4.9%), piezoelectric e(33) (17.4%), and permittivity \u03f5(33) (5.2%).

The neurophysiological basis for the effects of MDMA on somatosensation are unknown. However, MDMA interactions with the serotonin transporter (SERT) and subsequent enhancement of serotonin neurotransmission are well known. The rat trigeminal somatosensory system receives serotonergic afferents from the dorsal raphe nucleus. Because these fibers express SERT, they should be vulnerable to MDMA-induced effects. We found that administration of a challenge injection of MDMA (3 mg/kg i.p.) after repeated MDMA treatment (3 mg/kg per day for 4 days) elicits both serotonin and norepinephrine efflux in the ventral posterior medial (VPM) thalamus of Long-Evans hooded rats, the main relay along the lemniscal portion of the rodent trigeminal somatosensory pathway. We evaluated the potential for repeated MDMA administration to modulate whisker-evoked discharge of individual neurons in this region. After surgically implanting stainless steel eight-wire multichannel electrode bundles, we recorded spike train activity of single cells while activating the whisker pathway using a piezoelectric mechanical stimulator. We found that repeated MDMA administration increased the spontaneous firing rate but reduced both the magnitude and duration of whisker-evoked discharge in individual VPM thalamic neurons. The time course of drug action on neuronal firing patterns was generally consistent with fluctuations in neurotransmitter efflux as shown from our microdialysis studies. On the basis of these results, we propose that single use and repeated administration of MDMA may \"distort,\" rather than enhance, tactile experiences in humans, in part, by disrupting normal spike firing patterns through somatosensory thalamic relay circuits.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2011-10-11", "authors": ["M AStarr", "M EPage", "B DWaterhouse"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.111.185728"}
{"title": "Note: anti-strong-disturbance signal processing method of vortex flowmeter with two sensors.", "abstract": "Some digital signal processing methods have been used to deal with the output signal of vortex flowmeter for extracting the flow rate frequency from the noisy output of vortex flow rate sensor and achieving the measurement of small flow rate. In applications, however, the power of noise is larger than that of flow rate sometimes. These strong disturbances are caused by pipe vibration mostly. Under this condition the previous digital signal processing methods will be unavailable. Therefore, an anti-strong-disturbance solution is studied for the vortex flowmeter with two sensors in this Note. In this solution, two piezoelectric sensors are installed in the vortex probe. One is called the flow rate sensor for measuring both the flow rate and vibration noise, and the other is called the vibration sensor for detecting the vibration noise and sensing the flow rate signal weakly at the same time. An anti-strong-disturbance signal processing method combining the frequency-domain substation algorithm with the frequency-variance calculation algorithm is proposed to identify the flow rate frequency. When the peak number of amplitude spectrum of the flow rate sensor is different from that of the vibration sensor, the frequency-domain subtraction algorithm will be adopted; when the peak number of amplitude spectrum of the flow rate sensor is the same as that of the vibration sensor, the frequency-variance calculation algorithm will be employed. The whole algorithm is implemented in real time by an ultralow power micro control unit (MCU) to meet requirements of process instrumentation. The experimental results show that this method can obtain the flow rate frequency correctly even if the power of the pipe vibration noise is larger than that of the vortex flow rate signal.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2011-10-07", "authors": ["Ke-JunXu", "Qing-LinLuo", "MingFang", "GangWang", "San-ShanLiu", "Yi-BoKang", "LeiShi"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3632119"}

{"title": "Whispering-gallery acoustic sensing: characterization of mesoscopic films and scanning probe microscopy applications.", "abstract": "Full understanding of the physics underlying the striking changes in viscoelasticity, relaxation time, and phase transitions that mesoscopic fluid-like films undergo at solid-liquid interfaces, or under confinement between two sliding solid boundaries, constitutes one of the major challenges in condensed matter physics. Their role in the imaging process of solid substrates by scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is also currently controversial. Aiming at improving the reliability and versatility of instrumentation dedicated to characterize mesoscopic films, a noninvasive whispering-gallery acoustic sensing (WGAS) technique is introduced; its application as feedback control in SPM is also demonstrated. To illustrate its working principle and potential merits, WGAS has been integrated into a SPM that uses a sharp tip attached to an electrically driven 32-kHz piezoelectric tuning fork (TF), the latter also tighten to the operating microscope's frame. Such TF-based SPMs typically monitor the TF's state of motion by electrical means, hence subjected to the effects caused by the inherent capacitance of the device (i.e., electrical resonance differing from the probe's mechanical resonance). Instead, the novelty of WGAS resides in exploiting the already existent microscope's frame as an acoustic cavity (its few centimeter-sized perimeter closely matching the operating acoustic wavelength) where standing-waves (generated by the nanometer-sized oscillations of the TF's tines) are sensitively detected by an acoustic transducer (the latter judiciously placed around the microscope's frame perimeter for attaining maximum detection). This way, WGAS is able to remote monitoring, via acoustic means, the nanometer-sized amplitude motion of the TF's tines. (This remote-detection method resembles the ability to hear faint, but still clear, levels of sound at the galleries of a cathedral, despite the extraordinary distance location of the sound source.) In applications aiming at characterizing the dynamics of fluid-like mesoscopic films trapped under shear between the TF probe and the solid substrate, WGAS capitalizes on the well-known fact that the TF's motion is sensitively affected by the shear-forces (the substrate and its adsorbed mesocopic film playing a role) exert on its tip, which occurs when the latter is placed in close proximity to a solid substrate. Thus, WGAS uses a TF as an efficient transducer sandwiched between (i) the probe (that interact with the substrate and mesoscopic film), and (ii) the acoustic cavity (where an assessment of the probe mechanical motion is obtained). In short, WGAS has capability for monitoring probe-sample shear-force interactions via remote acoustic sensing means. In another application, WGAS can also be used as feedback control of the probe's vertical position in SPM. In effect, it is observed that when the microscope's probe stylus approaches a sample, a monotonic change of the WGAS acoustic signal occurs in the last ~20 nm before the probe touches the solid sample's surface, which allows implementing an automated-control of the probe-sample distance for safely scanning the tip across the sample surface. This principle is demonstrated by imaging the topographic features of a standard sample. Finally, it is worth to highlight that this alignment-free acoustic-based method offers a very direct assessment of the probe's mechanical motion state (the mechanical and the WGAS acoustic frequency responses coincide), which makes the WGAS a convenient metrology tool for studying surface interactions, including interfacial friction at the nanometer scale.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2011-10-07", "authors": ["Andres HLa Rosa", "NanLi", "RodolfoFernandez", "XiaohuaWang", "RichardNordstrom", "S KPadigi"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3635224"}

The considered FSAT design is characterized by a spiral configuration in wavenumber domain, which leads to a spatial arrangement of the sensing material producing output signals whose dominant frequency component is uniquely associated with the direction of incoming waves. The resulting spiral FSAT can be employed both for directional sensing and generation of guided waves, without relying on phasing and control of a large number of channels. The analytical expression of the shape of the spiral FSAT is obtained through the theoretical formulation for continuously distributed active material as part of a shaped piezoelectric device. Testing is performed by forming a discrete array through the points of the measurement grid of a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The discrete array approximates the continuous spiral FSAT geometry, and provides the flexibility to test several configurations.

{"title": "Critical Property in Relaxor-PbTiO(3) Single Crystals --- Shear Piezoelectric Response.", "abstract": "The shear piezoelectric behavior in relaxor-PbTiO(3) (PT) single crystals is investigated in regard to crystal phase. High levels of shear piezoelectric activity, d(15) or d(24) >2000 pC N(-1), has been observed for single domain rhombohedral (R), orthorhombic (O) and tetragonal (T) relaxor-PT crystals. The high piezoelectric response is attributed to a flattening of the Gibbs free energy at compositions proximate to the morphotropic phase boundaries, where the polarization rotation is easy with applying perpendicular electric field. The shear piezoelectric behavior of pervoskite ferroelectric crystals was discussed with respect to ferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transitions and dc bias field using phenomenological approach. The relationship between single domain shear piezoelectric response and piezoelectric activities in domain engineered configurations were given in this paper.

A temperature independent shear piezoelectric response (d(24), in the range of -50\u00b0C to O-T phase transition temperature) is thermodynamically expected and experimentally confirmed in orthorhombic relaxor-PT crystals; relatively high ac field drive stability (5 kV cm(-1)) is obtained in manganese modified relaxor-PT crystals.

The aim of the present prospective study was to assess the outcomes of a surgical protocol to remove 3Ms including the use of ultrasound bone surgery devices and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) as a grafting material.\nTwenty-eight impacted mandibular 3Ms were removed. Fourteen 3Ms were removed by piezoelectric osteotomy and PRF application. Instead, the 14 3Ms of the control group were removed by piezoelectric osteotomy but without PRF application. Probing depth in the distal position for all the mandibular second molars was registered before and 6 months after surgery.\nNo complications were encountered. In the study group, alveolar socket fulfillment was rated as sufficient in 4 cases and adequate in the remaining 10 cases, whereas in the control group, it was rated as insufficient in 3 cases, sufficient in 4 cases, and adequate in 7 cases.

However, agglomeration of nanoparticles remains as one of the major obstacles for generating a uniform surface. In this study, a new method for in situ preparation of Al-containing PVDF ultrafiltration membranes to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles is reported. The strategy of this method is to combine sol-gel process with traditional immersion precipitation process. Al sol was synthesized by the addition of anionic exchange resin in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent containing aluminum chloride. Homogeneous Al-containing PVDF casting solution was then obtained by dissolving PVDF polymer in the Al sol. The membrane formation mechanism was investigated by precipitation kinetics and morphology. Results indicate that the addition of Al species can accelerate phase inversion of casting solution. Scanning electron microscopic images show that a typical transition from sponge-like structure to finger-like structure occurred with increasing Al species content. The existence and dispersion states of Al species in the resultant membrane matrix were further examined by transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The results indicate the Al species nanoparticles were well dispersed throughout PVDF matrix.

Introduction of the less traumatic and more efficient piezo drill-assisted ICSI (PDAI) yielded higher cleavage rates and more consistent results. Nevertheless, PDAI is also associated with disadvantages such as the use of mercury and possible DNA damage. This led us to explore an alternative method avoiding oocyte trauma, namely laser-assisted ICSI (LAI), which involves creating a hole in the ZP prior to ICSI.

Contrary to the analytical approach, the adopted numerical methods, including the ordinary differential equation (ODE) and the stiffness matrix method (SMM), treat separately the electrical and mechanical gradients. The influences of graded variations applied to FGPM film coefficients on the dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves are discussed. The effects of gradient coefficients on electromechanical coupling factor, displacement fields, stress distributions and electrical potential, are reported. The obtained deviations in comparison with the ungraded homogenous film are plotted with respect to the dimensionless wavenumber. Opposite effects are observed on the coupling factor when graded variations are applied separately.

After 4 and 8 hrs, significantly higher cell numbers were associated with bone mill and bone scraper samples compared with those acquired by bone slurry and piezo-surgery.

Furthermore, osteoblasts seeded on bone mill and scraper samples expressed significantly elevated mRNA levels of collagen, osteocalcin, and osterix at 3 and 14 days and produced more mineralized tissue as assessed by alizarin red staining.

Ceramic lead-free piezoelectric materials were prepared in bulk and fiber forms with 1 mol% CuO-added potassium sodium niobate K0.5Na0.5NbO3 and x = 7 mol% lithium-modified (K(0.5-x/2)Na(0.5-x/2)Li(x))NbO(3) compositions. Fibers were drawn using a novel alginate gelation technique. Piezocomposites were prepared from these fibers with 1-3 connectivity and an epoxy matrix. A fully recoverable electrostrain of up to approximately 0.11% was observed in the CuO-added sample, whereas the Li-modified sample yielded up to 0.10% at 50 kV/cm electric field. A strain value of up to approximately 0.03% at 50 kV/cm electric field was obtained for piezocomposites prepared from lithium-modified fibers. The high-field converse piezoelectric coefficient was calculated from the strain-electric field (x-E) graph for all samples.

However, they are also subject to phase transitions affecting their behavior at temperatures and pressures encountered in underwater sonar and actuator applications and in non-destructive testing at elevated temperatures. Materials with modified compositions to reduce these problems are now under development, but application-oriented characterization techniques need further attention. Characterization with temperature variation has been reported extensively, but the range of parameters measured is often limited and the effects of pressure variation have received almost no attention. Furthermore, variation in properties between samples is now rarely reported. The focus of this paper is an experimental system set up with commercially available equipment and software to carry out characterization of piezoelectric single crystals with variation in temperature, pressure, and electrical bias fields found in typical practical use. We illustrate its use with data from bulk thickness-mode PMN-29%PT samples, demonstrating variation among nominally identical samples and showing not only the commonly reported changes in permittivity with temperature for bulk material but also significant and complicated changes with pressure and bias field and additional ultrasonic modes which are attributed to material phase changes.

{"title": "Designing piezoelectric films for micro electromechanical systems.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric thin films are of increasing interest in low-voltage micro electromechanical systems for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting. They also serve as model systems to study fundamental behavior in piezoelectrics. Next-generation technologies such as ultrasound pill cameras, flexible ultrasound arrays, and energy harvesting systems for unattended wireless sensors will all benefit from improvements in the piezoelectric properties of the films. This paper describes tailoring the composition, microstructure, orientation of thin films, and substrate choice to optimize the response. It is shown that increases in the grain size of lead-based perovskite films from 75 to 300 nm results in 40 and 20% increases in the permittivity and piezoelectric coefficients, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in the nonlinearity in the response. Band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy was used to interrogate the nonlinearity locally. It was found that chemical solution-derived PbZr(0.52)Ti(0.48)O(3) thin films show clusters of larger nonlinear response embedded in a more weakly nonlinear matrix. The scale of the clusters significantly exceeds that of the grain size, suggesting that collective motion of many domain walls contributes to the observed Rayleigh behavior in these films. Finally, it is shown that it is possible to increase the energy-harvesting figure of merit through appropriate materials choice, strong imprint, and composite connectivity patterns.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2011-09-23", "authors": ["SusanTrolier-McKinstry", "FlavioGriggio", "CharlesYaeger", "PierreJousse", "DalongZhao", "Srowthi S NBharadwaja", "Thomas NJackson", "StephenJesse", "Sergei VKalinin", "KiyotakaWasa"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2015"}

{"title": "Electromechanical coupling and temperature-dependent polarization reversal in piezoelectric ceramics.", "abstract": "Electrostriction plays a central role in describing the electromechanical properties of ferroelectric materials, including widely used piezoelectric ceramics. The piezoelectric properties are closely related to the underlying electrostriction. Small-field piezoelectric properties can be described as electrostriction offset by the remanent polarization which characterizes the ferroelectric state. Indeed, even large-field piezoelectric effects are accurately accounted for by quadratic electrostriction. However, the electromechanical properties deviate from this simple electrostrictive description at electric fields near the coercive field. This is particularly important for actuator applications, for which very high electromechanical coupling can be obtained in this region. This paper presents the results of an experimental study of electromechanical coupling in piezoelectric ceramics at electric field strengths close to the coercive field, and the effects of temperature on electromechanical processes during polarization reversal.

Our contribution deals only with the mechanical processes and the biological aspects have not been taken into account. It is well known that osteoblasts are able to generate bone in a suitable bony substitute only under fluid action. But the bone created in this manner is not organised to resist specific mechanical stress. Our aim was to suggest the nature of the physical information that can be transmitted - directly or via a biological or biochemical process - to the cell to initiate a cellular activity inducing the reconstruction of the osteon that is best adapted to local mechanical stresses. For this, the cell must have, from our point of view, a good knowledge of its structural environment. But this knowledge exists at the cellular scale while the bone is loaded at the macroscopic scale. This study is based on the SiNuPrOs model that allows exchange of information between the different structural scales of cortical bone. It shows that more than the fluid, the collagen - via its piezoelectric properties - plays an essential role in the transmission of information between the macroscopic and nanoscopic scales.

{"title": "Surface charge and piezoelectric fields control auger recombination in semiconductor nanocrystals.", "abstract": "The dynamics of biexcitons in CdSe nanoparticles are examined as a function of the magnitudes of internal electric fields. We show that the presence of strong internal fields results in rapid Auger recombination. The strengths of the electric fields and hence the Auger recombination rates are controlled in several different ways: specifically, by varying the dielectric constant of the surrounding solvent, by changing the particle surface stoichiometry and hence the magnitude of surface charges, and by inducing a piezoelectric field through the deposition of a lattice-mismatched shell material. Auger recombination is a momentum forbidden process. Fourier transformation of calculated spatial wave functions shows that higher conduction band states have large momentum components that relax the momentum conservation constraints. Relative Auger recombination times depend upon the extent to which the internal electric fields mix conduction band levels, which is easily calculated. Comparison with calculations of valence band states suggests that the excited particle in biexciton Auger recombination is the other electron. The experimental results can therefore be understood in terms of mixing of higher conduction band states with the lowest state from which recombination occurs.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2011-09-16", "authors": ["Zhong-JieJiang", "David FKelley"], "doi": "10.1021/nl201052r"}

It is proposed that a dual-layer hollow fiber consisting of a fully finger-like macrovoid inner-layer and a sponge-like outer-layer may effectively enhance the permeation flux while maintaining the wetting resistance. Dual-layer fibers with the proposed morphology have been fabricated by the dry-jet wet spinning process via careful choice of dopes composition and coagulation conditions. In addition to high energy efficiency (EE) of 94%, a superior flux of 98.6 L m(-2) h(-1) is obtained during the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) desalination experiments. Moreover, the liquid entry pressure (LEP) and long-term DCMD performance test show high wetting resistance and long-term stability. Mathematical modeling has been conducted to investigate the membrane mass transfer properties in terms of temperature profile and apparent diffusivity of the membranes. It is concluded that the enhancement in permeation flux arises from the coupling effect of two mechanisms; namely, a higher driving force and a lower mass transfer resistance, while the later is the major contribution. This work provides an insight on MD fundamentals and strategy to tailor making ideal membranes for DCMD application in desalination industry.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2011-09-09", "authors": ["PengWang", "May MayTeoh", "Tai-ShungChung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2011.08.012"}

{"title": "Note: Piezoelectric strain voltage sensing at ultra-low frequencies.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric sensors have emerged as a versatile tool for measurement of various quantities such as pressure, acceleration, strain, or force across many industrial applications. When mechanically strained, electric charges are produced inside a piezoelectric transducer. These charges result in an electric field that may be measured as a voltage difference between two electrodes, from which the strain can be inferred. To measure this voltage the sensor must be interfaced with an external device that would typically have a finite input impedance. This, together with the capacitive nature of the piezoelectric sensor, results in an inability to measure strain at low frequencies. We propose a method, based on using a varactor diode in an oscillator circuit, which can result in accurate measurements of the piezoelectric voltage at ultra-low frequencies.

{"title": "Determination of acoustic impedances of multi matching layers for narrowband ultrasonic airborne transducers at frequencies <2.5 MHz - Application of a genetic algorithm.", "abstract": "The effective ultrasonic energy radiation into the air of piezoelectric transducers requires using multilayer matching systems with accurately selected acoustic impedances and the thickness of particular layers. One major problem of ultrasonic transducers, radiating acoustic energy into air, is to find the proper acoustic impedances of one or more matching layers. This work aims at developing an original solution to the acoustic impedance mismatch between transducer and air. If the acoustic impedance defences between transducer and air be more, then finding best matching layer(s) is harder. Therefore we consider PZT (lead zirconate titanate piezo electric) transducer and air that has huge acoustic impedance deference. The vibration source energy (PZT), which is used to generate the incident wave, consumes a part of the mechanical energy and converts it to an electrical one in theoretical calculation. After calculating matching layers, we consider the energy source as layer to design a transducer. However, this part of the mechanical energy will be neglected during the mathematical work. This approximation is correct only if the transducer is open-circuit. Since the possibilities of choosing material with required acoustic impedance are limited (the counted values cannot always be realized and applied in practice) it is necessary to correct the differences between theoretical values and the possibilities of practical application of given acoustic impedances. Such a correction can be done by manipulating other parameters of matching layers (e.g. by changing their thickness). The efficiency of the energy transmission from the piezoceramic transducer through different layers with different thickness and different attenuation enabling a compensation of non-ideal real values by changing their thickness was computer analyzed (base on genetic algorithm). Firstly, three theoretical solutions were investigated. Namely, Chebyshev, Desilets and Souquet theories. However, the obtained acoustic impedances do not necessarily correspond to a nowadays available material. Consequently, the values of the acoustic impedances are switched to the nearest values in a large material database. The switched values of the acoustic impedances do not generally give efficient transmission coefficients. Therefore, we proposed, in a second step, the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the best acoustic impedances for matching layers from the material database for a narrow band ultrasonic transducer that work at frequency below the 2.5MHz by considering attenuation. However this bank is rich, the results get better. So the accuracy of the propose method increase by using a lot of materials with exact data for acoustic impedance and their attenuation, especially in high frequency. This yields highly more efficient transmission coefficient. In fact by using increasing number of layer we can increase our chance to find the best sets of materials with valuable both in acoustic impedance and low attenuation. Precisely, the transmission coefficient is almost equal to unity for the all studied cases. Finally the effect of thickness on transmission coefficient is investigated for different layers. The results showed that the transmission coefficient for air media is a function of thickness and sensitive to it even for small variation in thickness. In fact, the sensitivity increases when the differences of acoustic impedances to be high (difference between PZT and air).", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2011-09-07", "authors": ["SaberSaffar", "AmirAbdullah"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2011.08.001"}

In the present studies, we examined the influence of modulating nitric oxide availability on perfusion-contraction matching after recurrent no-flow ischaemia in acute open-chest, anaesthetized dogs. The following three groups were studied: (1) saline; (2) L-NAME (10 mg kg(-1) I.V.); and (3) enalaprilat (1.5 mg kg(-1) I.V.). Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with microspheres and contractile function with piezoelectric crystals to determine systolic wall thickening. Dogs underwent four cycles of 5 min acute ischaemia and 5 min coronary reperfusion; area at risk was similar for all groups. In all dogs, ischaemic zone contractile function was depressed after recurrent no-flow ischaemia despite increased myocardial blood flow during reperfusion; contractile function was further depressed during L-NAME and was partly restored with enalaprilat. Within the ischaemic region, blood flow in subendocardial and subepicardial layers increased significantly compared with baseline during each reperfusion period independently of treatment.

{"title": "Variability in the muscle composition of rat esophagus and neural pathway of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.", "abstract": "Several studies from our laboratory show that axial stretch of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in an oral direction causes neurally mediated LES relaxation. Under physiological conditions, axial stretch of the LES is caused by longitudinal muscle contraction (LMC) of the esophagus. Because longitudinal muscle is composed of skeletal muscle in mice, vagal-induced LMC and LES relaxation are both blocked by pancuronium. We conducted studies in rats (thought to have skeletal muscle esophagus) to determine if vagus nerve-mediated LES relaxation is also blocked by pancuronium. LMC-mediated axial stretch on the LES was monitored using piezoelectric crystals. LES and esophageal pressures were monitored with a 2.5-Fr solid-state pressure transducer catheter. Following bilateral cervical vagotomy, the vagus nerve was stimulated electrically. LES, along with the esophagus, was harvested after in vivo experiments and immunostained for smooth muscle (smooth muscle \u03b1-actin) and skeletal muscle (fast myosin heavy chain). Vagus nerve-stimulated LES relaxation and esophageal LMC were reduced in a dose-dependent fashion and completely abolished by pancuronium (96 \u03bcg/kg) in six rats (group 1). On the other hand, in seven rats, LES relaxation and LMC were only blocked completely by a combination of pancuronium (group 2) and hexamethonium. Immunostaining revealed that the longitudinal muscle layer was composed of predominantly skeletal muscle in the group 1 rats. On the other hand, the longitudinal muscle layer of group 2 rats contained a significant amount of smooth muscle (P < 0.05). Our study shows tight coupling between axial stretch on the LES and relaxation of the LES, which suggests a cause and effect relationship between the two.

In this study, we present two new electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)-based multi-dimensional electrophoresis approaches to isolate and characterize TFs, using detection with either southwestern or western blotting and HPLC-nanoESI-MS/MS analysis for identification. These new techniques involve several major steps. First, EMSA is performed with agents that diminish non-specific DNA-binding and the DNA-protein complex is separated by native PAGE gel. The gel is then electrotransferred to PVDF membrane and visualized by autoradiography. Next, the DNA-protein complex, which has been transferred onto the blot, is extracted using a detergent-containing elution buffer. Following detergent removal, concentrated extract is separated by SDS-PAGE (EMSA-2DE), followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and HPLC-nanoESI-MS/MS analysis, or the concentrated extract is separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (EMSA-3DE), followed by southwestern or western blot analysis to localize DNA binding proteins on blot which are further identified by on-blot trypsin digestion and HPLC-nanoESI-MS/MS analysis. Finally, the identified DNA binding proteins are further validated by EMSA-immunoblotting or EMSA antibody supershift assay. This approach is used to purify and identify GFP-C/EBP fusion protein from bacterial crude extract, as well as purifying AP1 and CEBP DNA binding proteins from a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) nuclear extract.

Radiation responses are recorded in an anechoic chamber with multiple microphones placed at different angles around the violin.

{"title": "The impact of water and hydrocarbon concentration on the sensitivity of a polymer-based quartz crystal microbalance sensor for organic compounds.", "abstract": "Long-term environmental monitoring of organic compounds in natural waters requires sensors that respond reproducibly and linearly over a wide concentration range, and do not degrade with time. Although polymer coated piezoelectric based sensors have been widely used to detect hydrocarbons in aqueous solution, very little information exists regarding their stability and suitability over extended periods in water. In this investigation, the influence of water aging on the response of various polymer membranes [polybutadiene (PB), polyisobutylene (PIB), polystyrene (PS), polystyrene-co-butadiene (PSB)] was studied using the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). QCM measurements revealed a modest increase in sensitivity towards toluene for PB and PIB membranes at concentrations above 90 ppm after aging in water for 4 days. In contrast, the sensitivity of PS and PSB coated QCM sensors depended significantly on the toluene concentration and increased considerably at concentrations above 90 ppm after aging in water for 4 days. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) showed that there is a change in the sorption mechanism at higher toluene levels for PS and PSB. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) studies were performed to investigate the free volume properties of all polymers and to monitor any changes in the free volume size and distribution due to water and toluene exposure. The PALS did not detect any considerable variation in the free volume properties of the polymer films as a function of solution composition and soaking time, implying that viscoelastic and/or interfacial processes (i.e. surface area changes) are probably responsible for variations in the QCM sensitivity at high hydrocarbon concentrations. The results suggest that polymer membrane conditioning in water is an issue that needs to be considered when performing QCM measurements in the aqueous phase. In addition, the study shows that the hydrocarbon response is concentration dependant for polymers with a high glass transition temperature, and this feature is often neglected when comparing sensor sensitivity in the literature.", "journal": "Analytica chimica acta", "date": "2011-08-17", "authors": ["BobbyPejcic", "EmmaCrooke", "Cara MDoherty", "Anita JHill", "MatthewMyers", "XiubinQi", "AndrewRoss"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aca.2011.07.015"}

{"title": "Inkjet printing as a novel medicine formulation technique.", "abstract": "We demonstrate the viability of using an ink-jet printer to produce a formulation capable of controlling the release of a drug. This is shown for the drug felodipine, an antihypertensive, with polyvinyl pirrolidone (PVP) as an excipient. As felodipine is a poorly water soluble drug, its molecular dispersion in a soluble polymer (ie. PVP) is a commonly used approach to improve bioavailability. Various ratios of felodipine and PVP in an ethanol-DMSO mixture (95/5) were dispensed in picoliter quantities using a piezoelectric 'ink-jet' head onto a hydrophobic substrate. The resultant formulation spots were characterized using atomic force microscopy, localized nano-thermal analysis, ATR-IR and imaging confocal Raman spectroscopy. Intimate mixing of the felodipine and PVP within the micro-dots was observed. ATR-IR confirmed the known molecular level interaction of felodipine and PVP through hydrogen bonding. Nanothermal analysis indicated a single glass transition point, indicative of an intimate polymer drug mixture, which is lowered as the drug concentration increases. Confocal Raman microscopy mapping on single micro-scale droplets allowed the visualization of the drug distribution in the spots as well as facilitating characterization of the release of the drug. The drug release can be altered through control of the drug loading. As inkjet printing is an inherently scalable technology, this proof of principal work with single deposited micro-spot formulations demonstrates the potential of this approach to print practical dosage forms (e.g. as an array of many thousands of spots with different release profiles).

{"title": "Enhancing light emission of ZnO microwire-based diodes by piezo-phototronic effect.", "abstract": "Light emission from semiconductors depends not only on the efficiency of carrier injection and recombination but also extraction efficiency. For ultraviolet emission from high band gap materials such as ZnO, nanowires have higher extraction efficiencies than thin films, but conventional approaches for creating a p-n diode result in low efficiency. We exploited the noncentral symmetric nature of n-type ZnO nanowire/p-type GaN substrate to create a piezoelectric potential within the nanowire by applying stress. Because of the polarization of ions in a crystal that has noncentral symmetry, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal under stress. The piezopotential acts as a \"gate\" voltage to tune the charge transport and enhance carrier injection, which is called the piezo-phototronic effect. We propose that band modification traps free carriers at the interface region in a channel created by the local piezoelectric charges. The emission intensity and injection current at a fixed applied voltage have been enhanced by a factor of 17 and 4, respectively, after applying a 0.093% compressive strain and improved conversion efficiency by a factor of 4.25. This huge enhanced performance is suggested arising from an effective increase in the local \"biased voltage\" as a result of the band modification caused by piezopotential and the trapping of holes at the interface region in a channel created by the local piezoelectric charges near the interface.

In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that largely improved interfacial interaction could be obtained in continuously melt-spun fibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) composites, just by an increasing of the deformation extent (draw ratio). The superior interaction is attributed to high deformation inducing a formation of charge-transfer-type F-C bonding between all-trans conformation PVDF chains and extended MWCNTs. As a result, a large mechanical enhancement has been achieved. For the fibers prepared at the highest draw ratio of 200, the tensile strength and modulus are improved for 235% and 109%, respectively, after adding only 0.5 wt% MWCNTs to PVDF. More importantly, a mechanical model fitting, based on the rule of mixtures, indicates that in the case of the highest draw ratio the theoretical strength of MWCNTs is comparable to its real failure strength measured directly between two opposing AFM cantilever tips (Yu et al 2000 Science 287 637). Our present study suggests a great deal of promise for achieving highly efficient CNT enhancement via the non-covalent interaction arising from simple physical fabrication like melt-spinning.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2011-08-09", "authors": ["JinghuiYang", "QiyiChen", "FengChen", "QinZhang", "KeWang", "QiangFu"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/22/35/355707"}

A generalized spring-layer model is employed to characterize the interfacial imperfection. By introducing a dual system of local coordinates for each single layer, the numerical instability usually encountered in the state space method can be avoided. Based on the proposed method, a typical sandwich plate made of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic phases is considered in numerical examples to calculate the dispersion curves and mode shapes. It is demonstrated that the results obtained by the present method is unconditionally stable as compared to the traditional state space method. The influence of different interfacial bonding conditions on the dispersion characteristics and corresponding mode shapes is investigated.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2011-08-09", "authors": ["JunZhu", "WeiqiuChen", "GuiruYe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2011.07.004"}

In this study, starting with the \u03b1-phase dominated sample, the PVDF with extremely high content of \u03b2-crystalline phase was obtained by the incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified by hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs). We proved that, via XRD, DSC as well as the structural characterizations from the polarized optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the success of this strategy was ascribed to the enhanced dispersibility and stability of MWCNTs endowed by the HBCs, which significantly favors the formation of the \u03b2-crystalline phase of PVDF.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2011-08-09", "authors": ["LinghaoHe", "JingSun", "XiuxinWang", "LuYao", "JialongLi", "RuiSong", "YongmeiHao", "YujianHe", "WeiHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2011.07.042"}

{"title": "Characterization and calibration of piezoelectric polymers: in situ measurements of body vibrations.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric polymers are known for their flexibility in applications, mainly due to their bending ability, robustness, and variable sensor geometry. It is an optimal material for minimal-invasive investigations in vibrational systems, e.g., for wood, where acoustical impedance matches particularly well. Many applications may be imagined, e.g., monitoring of buildings, vehicles, machinery, alarm systems, such that our investigations may have a large impact on technology. Longitudinal piezoelectricity converts mechanical vibrations normal to the polymer-film plane into an electrical signal, and the respective piezoelectric coefficient needs to be carefully determined in dependence on the relevant material parameters. In order to evaluate efficiency and durability for piezopolymers, we use polyvinylidene fluoride and measure the piezoelectric coefficient with respect to static pressure, amplitude of the dynamically applied force, and long-term stability. A known problem is the slow relaxation of the material towards equilibrium, if the external pressure changes; here, we demonstrate how to counter this problem with careful calibration. Since our focus is on acoustical measurements, we determine accurately the frequency response curve--for acoustics probably the most important characteristic. Eventually, we show that our piezopolymer transducers can be used as a calibrated acoustical sensors for body vibration measurements on a wooden musical instrument, where it is important to perform minimal-invasive measurements. A comparison with the simultaneously recorded airborne sound yields important insight of the mechanism of sound radiation in comparison with the sound propagating in the material. This is especially important for transient signals, where not only the long-living eigenmodes contribute to the sound radiation.

We designed a human temporal-bone study with controlled direct mechanical stimulation of the RW membrane to identify conditions for successful RW stimulation. Eight human temporal bones were stimulated on the RW by piezoelectric stack actuators with cylindrical aluminium rods of diameter 0.5\u00a0mm and with either flat or 30\u00b0 inclined top surface. Using a dedicated two-stage positioning protocol for\u00a0the actuator, we achieved highly reproducible measurements of the stimulus vibration at the RW and of the resultant vibration of the stapes footplate. The reverse transmission, characterized by the displacement ratio of the stapes-footplate relative to the actuator tip on the RW membrane, yielded an average displacement ratio of 0.089 up to 1.2\u00a0kHz when the actuator was coupled without angular misalignment to the RW membrane. The results suggest that 90-\u03bcm pretension of the RW membrane is essential for optimum and reproducible RW stimulation. The displacements are shown to be roughly consistent with the equal-volume displacement hypothesis under specific assumptions about the displacement mode of the RW membrane. It is further suggested that the large inter-patient variability in the effectiveness of RW stimulation might be due primarily to the success of coupling, rather than to the variability of functionally relevant anatomical parameters.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2011-07-30", "authors": ["Sebastian PSchraven", "BernhardHirt", "Anthony WGummer", "Hans-PeterZenner", "ErnstDalhoff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2011.07.001"}

The system allows various intermittent and continuous distraction protocols to be simply selected using the control software. The maximum force of the laboratory-scale MAGD is 3 N, and the device is ready for adoption in small-animal distraction models such as the rat and mouse.

{"title": "An innovative piezoelectric-based method for measuring pulse wave velocity in patients with hypertension.", "abstract": "Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an accepted surrogate marker of arterial stiffness and may be a useful tool for assessing cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients. The authors sought to compare a novel polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric-based sensing device for measuring PWV in the arm with a validated SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, West Ryde, Australia) in normal and hypertensive patients. They also sought to compare measured PWV in the forearm (brachial-radial PWV [BRPWV]) with values obtained in the carotid-radial segment (carotid-radial PWV [CRPWV]). Under standardized conditions, CRPWV in 108 normotensive patients with both devices was measured. BRPWV was measured with the PVDF device. Identical measurements were made in a group of 82 hypertensive patients before and after optimization of blood pressure control. Mean CRPWV was 8.7 m/s in the normotensive group and 9.4 m/s in the hypertensive group. Mean BRPWV was 9.2\u2003m/s in the normotensive group and 10.3 m/s in the hypertensive group. There was excellent correlation between the 2 devices when comparing individual CRPWV values (normotensive group, R(2) = 0.92; mean bias 0.04 m/s; hypertensive group, R(2) = 0.89, mean bias 0.08 m/s). Correlation was also favorable when measuring changes in CRPWV in hypertensive patients undergoing pharmacotherapy (PVDF -0.52 \u00b1 0.90 m/s vs SphygmoCor -0.53 \u00b1 1.01 m/s; R(2) = 0.81). Measured values for BRPWV were significantly higher than CRPWV values, and this discrepancy was more marked in the hypertensive group. The PVDF piezoelectric device has excellent correlation with the validated SphygmoCor device when measuring PWV.

For the problem of linear static deformations we consider solutions, which are slowly varying in the plane of the plate in comparison to the thickness direction. A small parameter is introduced in the general equations of the theory of elasticity. According to the procedure of asymptotic splitting, the principal terms of the series expansion of the solution are determined from the conditions of solvability for the minor terms. Three-dimensional conditions of compatibility make the analysis more efficient and straightforward. We obtain the system of equations of classical Kirchhoff's plate theory, including the balance equations, compatibility conditions, elastic relations and kinematic relations between the displacements and strain measures. Subsequent analysis of the edge layer near the contour of the plate is required in order to satisfy the remaining boundary conditions of the three-dimensional problem. Matching of the asymptotic expansions of the solution in the edge layer and inside the domain provides four classical plate boundary conditions. Additional effects, like electromechanical coupling for piezoelectric plates, can easily be incorporated into the model due to the modular structure of the analysis. The results of the paper constitute a sound basis to the equations of the theory of classical plates with piezoelectric effects, and provide a trustworthy algorithm for computation of the stressed state in the three-dimensional problem.

{"title": "Elbow loading promotes longitudinal bone growth of the ulna and the humerus.", "abstract": "Mechanical stimulation plays a critical role in bone development and growth. In view of recently recognized anabolic responses promoted by a joint-loading modality, we examined the effects of elbow loading on longitudinal growth of the ulna and the humerus. Using a custom-made piezoelectric loader, the left elbow of growing C57/BL/6 female mice was given daily 5-min bouts of dynamic loading for 10\u00a0days. The right forelimbs of those mice served as contralateral controls, and the limbs of non-treated mice were used as age-matched controls. The effects of elbow loading were evaluated through measurement of bone length, weight, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone mineral content (BMC), as well as mRNA expression levels of load-sensitive transcription factors such as c-fos, egr1, and atf3. The results revealed that the humerus was elongated by 1.2% compared to the contralateral and age-matched controls (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while the ulna had become longer than the contralateral control (1.7%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and the age-match control (3.4%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Bone lengthening was associated with increases in bone weight, BMD and BMC. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of the selected transcription factors were elevated in the loaded ulna and humerus. Interestingly, the increase was observed not only at the elbow but also at the wrist and shoulder in the loaded limb.

A randomized controlled clinical trial.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the performance of conventional rotative instruments and a piezoelectric device for maxillary sinus floor elevation surgery, and to assess whether application of a resorbable membrane reduces resorption of an augmented site in a randomized clinical trial.\nThirty-six consecutive patients (59.2 \u00b1 10.7 years, range 38-76 years) needing bilateral sinus floor elevation surgery agreed to participate in this study. In a parallel split mouth design randomized clinical trial, in which the allocation of the surgical technique to be used on the determined sites was randomly assigned, one site was always treated with conventional rotative instruments (control group) and the other site with piezosurgery (test group). In addition, in a random order, the grafted sites were covered with a collagen membrane or no membrane. After a healing period of 3-4 months implants were placed.\nComparison of clinical features of the test and control sites revealed no differences with regard to wound healing and complications (perforations of the sinus membrane) during or postsurgery (p = .458, p = 1.0, respectively). A clinically insignificant, but statistically shorter operation time was observed when using conventional rotative instruments (11.1 \u00b1 2.4 minutes) than using piezosurgery (15.1 \u00b1 2.9 minutes; p < .001). In both groups, application of a resorbable membrane did not result in less horizontal bone resorption (membrane: 1.43 mm, no membrane: 1.06 mm; p = .062); All 193 implants could be placed with primary stability. One year after functional loading, survival rate was 100%.\nIt can be concluded that, for maxillary sinus floor elevation surgery, a piezoelectric device shows no advantages over rotative instruments as well as that placement of a barrier membrane did not reduce resorption of the augmented site.", "journal": "Clinical implant dentistry and related research", "date": "2011-07-13", "authors": ["DanielaRickert", "ArjanVissink", "James J R HuddlestonSlater", "Henny J AMeijer", "Gerry MRaghoebar"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1708-8208.2011.00364.x"}

The composite membranes thus fabricated were tested for their pervaporation performance in dehydrating an ethyl acetate/water mixture.

Effects of grafting density and spin-coating speed on pervaporation performance were examined. The composite membrane pervaporation performance was elucidated by means of free volume and depth profile data obtained with the use of a variable monoenergy slow positron beam (VMSPB). Results indicated that a smaller free volume was correlated with a higher pervaporation performance of a composite membrane consisting of a selective layer of spin-coated PHEMA on a PHEMA-grafted PVDF substrate (S-PHEMA/PHEMA-g-PVDF).

The experimentally observed excitonic spectrum by Krenner et al (2005) Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 057402 is quantitatively reproduced, and the correct energy states are identified based on a previously validated atomistic tight binding model. The extended devices are represented explicitly in space with 15-million-atom structures. An excited state spectroscopy technique is applied where the externally applied electric field is swept to probe the ladder of the electronic energy levels (electron or hole) of one quantum dot through anti-crossings with the energy levels of the other quantum dot in a two-quantum-dot molecule. This technique can be used to estimate the spatial electron-hole spacing inside the quantum dot molecule as well as to reverse engineer quantum dot geometry parameters such as the quantum dot separation. Crystal-deformation-induced piezoelectric effects have been discussed in the literature as minor perturbations lifting degeneracies of the electron excited (P and D) states, thus affecting polarization alignment of wavefunction lobes for III-V heterostructures such as single InAs/GaAs quantum dots. In contrast, this work demonstrates the crucial importance of piezoelectricity to resolve the symmetries and energies of the excited states through matching the experimentally measured spectrum in an InGaAs quantum dot molecule under the influence of an electric field. Both linear and quadratic piezoelectric effects are studied for the first time for a quantum dot molecule and demonstrated to be indeed important.

{"title": "Structural consequences of ferroelectric nanolithography.", "abstract": "Domains of remnant polarization can be written into ferroelectrics with nanoscale precision using scanning probe nanolithography techniques such as piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). Understanding the structural effects accompanying this process has been challenging due to the lack of appropriate structural characterization tools. Synchrotron X-ray nanodiffraction provides images of the domain structure written by PFM into an epitaxial Pb(Zr,Ti)O(3) thin film and simultaneously reveals structural effects arising from the writing process. A coherent scattering simulation including the superposition of the beams simultaneously diffracted by multiple mosaic blocks provides an excellent fit to the observed diffraction patterns. Domains in which the polarization is reversed from the as-grown state have a strain of up to 0.1% representing the piezoelectric response to unscreened surface charges. An additional X-ray microdiffraction study of the photon-energy dependence of the difference in diffracted intensity between opposite polarization states shows that this contrast has a crystallographic origin. The sign and magnitude of the intensity contrast between domains of opposite polarization are consistent with the polarization expected from PFM images and with the writing of domains through the entire thickness of the ferroelectric layer. The strain induced by writing provides a significant additional contribution to the increased free energy of the written domain state with respect to a uniformly polarized state.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2011-07-07", "authors": ["Ji YoungJo", "PiceChen", "Rebecca JSichel", "Seung-HyubBaek", "Ryan TSmith", "NinaBalke", "Sergei VKalinin", "Martin VHolt", "J\u00f6rgMaser", "KennethEvans-Lutterodt", "Chang-BeomEom", "Paul GEvans"], "doi": "10.1021/nl2009873"}

This paper is devoted to modeling of a resonant power transducer at a high level of dynamic mechanical stress. The power transducer is subjected to a sine electrical field E of varying frequency which was considered as the excitation of the transducer. The mechanical equation of the piezoelectric element is written using electrostriction. The dielectric part is written as a nonlinear function of an equivalent electric field including stress influence (scaling relationship between electric field and mechanical stress). Using various simulations, we show then that typical resonance nonlinearities are obtained, such as jump phenomenon of transducer speed amplitude and phase, resonance peak that become asymmetric, and diminution of mechanical quality factor. As a consequence, we state that those typical nonlinearities are only due to dielectric nonlinearities, in good correlation with typical ferroelectric behavior. Moreover, this demonstrates the usefulness of scaling relationships in ferroelectrics, which explain static depoling under stress and butterfly strain hysteresis loop. The same scaling law gives here several nonlinearities for resonant transducers as well.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2011-07-05", "authors": ["DGuyomar", "BDucharne", "GSebald"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2011.05.017"}

No human data are available for the possible effects of single US applications on microcirculation and their frequency-dependency.\nTo investigated the role of therapeutic low-frequency US on microcirculation of venous leg ulcers in vivo.\nThis is a pilot study on an inpatient basis. We use a newly developed low-frequency continuous-wave US-equipment composed of a US transducer based on piezo-fiber composites that allow the change of frequency. In this study, we apply US of 34 kHz, 53.5 kHz, and 75 kHz respectively. Twelve patients with chronic venous leg ulcers are analyzed. As an adjunct to good ulcer care, therapeutic US is applied, non-contacting, once a day, in a subaqual position for 10 minutes. Microcirculation is assessed in the ulcers adjacent to skin before US-therapy, immediately after the treatment and 30 minutes later.

Contact-free remission spectroscopy (SkinREM3, Color Control Chemnitz GmbH, Chemnitz, Germany) allows contact free measurements in the VIS-NIR range of the spectrum (400 \u00b1 1600 nm).\nIt is seen that therapeutic US is well tolerated. One patient dropped out from a treatment series since he developed erysipelas responding to standard antibiotic. Effects were seen at 34 kHz only. The SO(2) values increased after single US application. The values for rHb were higher in the superficial layer of the wound bed (depth 2 mm) compared to deeper parts (8 mm depth). US treatment did not result in significant changes of rHb and blood cell velocity. The data obtained by remission spectroscopy disclose an increase of oxygenized hemoglobin.\nThe major findings are that continuous-wave low-frequency US of 34 kHz, but not, 53.5 kHz or 75 kHz, has a temporary stimulatory effect on microcirculation mainly due to an improved oxygenation.

{"title": "Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process for the treatment of olive mill wastewater.", "abstract": "Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is an important environmental pollution problem, especially in the Mediterranean, which is the main olive oil production region worldwide. Environmental impact of OMW is related to its high organic load and particularly to the phytotoxic and antibacterial action of its phenolic content. In fact, polyphenols are known as powerful antioxidants with interesting nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. In the present work, the efficiency of OMW Micellar Enhanced Ultrafiltration (MEUF) treatment for removal and concentration of polyphenols was investigated, using an anionic surfactant (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate salt, SDS) and a hydrophobic poly(vinyldene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. The effects of the process experimental conditions on the permeate flux were investigated, and the secondary membrane resistance created by SDS molecules was evaluated. The initial fluxes of OMW processing by MEUF using SDS were 25.7 and 44.5 l/m2 h under transmembrane pressures of 3.5 and 4.5 bar, respectively. The rejection rate of polyphenols without using any surfactant ranged from 5 to 28%, whereas, it reached 74% when SDS was used under optimum pH (pH 2). The MEUF provides a slightly colored permeate (about 88% less dark), which requires clearly less chemical oxygen demand (COD) for its oxidation (4.33% of the initial COD). These results showed that MEUF process can efficiently be applied to the treatment of OMW and for the concentration and recovery of polyphenols.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2011-07-01", "authors": ["AbdelilahEl-Abbassi", "MohamedKhayet", "AbdellatifHafidi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2011.05.044"}

Non-mammalian prestin orthologues are anion transporters without piezoelectric activity. Here, we generated synthetic prestin (SynPres), a chimera of mammalian and non-mammalian prestin exhibiting both, piezoelectric properties and anion transport. SynPres delineates two distinct domains in the protein's transmembrane core that are necessary and sufficient for generating electromotility and associated non-linear charge movement (NLC). Functional analysis of SynPres showed that the amplitude of NLC and hence electromotility are determined by the transport of monovalent anions. Thus, prestin-mediated electromotility is a dual-step process: transport of anions by an alternate access cycle, followed by an anion-dependent transition generating electromotility. The findings define structural and functional determinants of prestin's piezoelectric activity and indicate that the electromechanical process evolved from the ancestral transport mechanism.", "journal": "The EMBO journal", "date": "2011-06-28", "authors": ["Thorsten JSchaechinger", "DmitryGorbunov", "Christian RHalaszovich", "TobiasMoser", "SebastianK\u00fcgler", "BerndFakler", "DominikOliver"], "doi": "10.1038/emboj.2011.202"}

Both groups showed an initial decrease in mean implant stability quotient (ISQ) values: a shift in implant stability to increasing ISQ values occurred after 14 days in the test group and after 21 days in the control group. The lowest mean ISQ value was recorded at 14 days for test implants (97.3% of the primary stability) and at 21 days for the control implants (90.8% of the primary stability).

The developed device uses a piezoelectric actuator to apply a displacement to a tooth's crown, and the resulting force is measured by an integrated force sensor. To measure the tooth displacement independently and non-invasively, two magnets are fixed on the teeth. The change in the magnetic field caused by the movement of the magnets is measured by a total of 16 Hall sensors. The displacement of the tooth is calculated from the movement of the magnets. The device was tested in vitro on premolars of four porcine mandibular segments and in vivo on two volunteers. The teeth were loaded with varying activation curves.

Following qualitative review, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of CLSA for the detection of abnormal lung sounds.\nOf 208 articles identified, we selected eight studies for review. Most studies employed either electret microphones or piezoelectric sensors for auscultation, and Fourier Transform and Neural Network algorithms for analysis and automated classification of lung sounds. Overall sensitivity for the detection of wheezes or crackles using CLSA was 80% (95% CI 72-86%) and specificity was 85% (95% CI 78-91%).\nWhile quality data on CLSA are relatively limited, analysis of existing information suggests that CLSA can provide a relatively high specificity for detecting abnormal lung sounds such as crackles and wheezes. Further research and product development could promote the value of CLSA in research studies or its diagnostic utility in clinical settings.", "journal": "Respiratory medicine", "date": "2011-06-17", "authors": ["AratiGurung", "Carolyn GScrafford", "James MTielsch", "Orin SLevine", "WilliamCheckley"], "doi": "10.1016/j.rmed.2011.05.007"}
{"title": "Integrated scanning Kelvin probe-scanning electrochemical microscope system: development and first applications.", "abstract": "The integration of a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) and a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) into a single SKP-SECM setup, the concept of the proposed system, its technical realization, and first applications are presented and discussed in detail. A preloaded piezo actuator placed in a grounded stainless steel case was used as the driving mechanism for oscillation of a Pt disk electrode as conventionally used in SECM when the system was operated in the SKP mode. Thus, the same tip is recording the contact potential difference (CPD) during SKP scanning and is used as a working electrode for SECM imaging in the redox-competition mode (RC-SECM). The detection of the local CPD is established by amplification of the displacement current at an ultralow noise operational amplifier and its compensation by application of a variable backing potential (V(b)) in the external circuit. The control of the tip-to-sample distance is performed by applying an additional alternating voltage with a much lower frequency than the oscillation frequency of the Kelvin probe. The main advantage of the SKP-SECM system is that it allows constant distance measurements of the CPD in air under ambient conditions and in the redox-competition mode of the SECM in the electrolyte of choice over the same sample area without replacement of the sample or exchange of the working electrode. The performance of the system was evaluated using a test sample made by sputtering thin Pt and W films on an oxidized silicon wafer. The obtained values of the CPD correlate well with known data, and the electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction is as expected higher over Pt than W.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2011-06-17", "authors": ["ArtjomMaljusch", "BerndSch\u00f6nberger", "ArminLindner", "MartinStratmann", "MichaelRohwerder", "WolfgangSchuhmann"], "doi": "10.1021/ac200953b"}

{"title": "Distinguishing homogeneous from heterogeneous catalysis in electrode-driven water oxidation with molecular iridium complexes.", "abstract": "Molecular water-oxidation catalysts can deactivate by side reactions or decompose to secondary materials over time due to the harsh, oxidizing conditions required to drive oxygen evolution. Distinguishing electrode surface-bound heterogeneous catalysts (such as iridium oxide) from homogeneous molecular catalysts is often difficult. Using an electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), we report a method for probing electrodeposition of metal oxide materials from molecular precursors. Using the previously reported [Cp*Ir(H(2)O)(3)](2+) complex, we monitor deposition of a heterogeneous water oxidation catalyst by measuring the electrode mass in real time with piezoelectric gravimetry. Conversely, we do not observe deposition for homogeneous catalysts, such as the water-soluble complex Cp*Ir(pyr-CMe(2)O)X reported in this work. Rotating ring-disk electrode electrochemistry and Clark-type electrode studies show that this complex is a catalyst for water oxidation with oxygen produced as the product. For the heterogeneous, surface-attached material generated from [Cp*Ir(H(2)O)(3)](2+), we can estimate the percentage of electroactive metal centers in the surface layer. We monitor electrode composition dynamically during catalytic turnover, providing new information on catalytic performance.

Attempts to make a diagnosis of this disease need to be improved, especially in endemic areas, and in the tracking and screening of asymptomatic dogs, which are their main host in urban areas. A quartz crystal microbalance immunosensor for the diagnosis of the canine visceral leishmaniasis using a recombinant antigen of Leishmania chagasi (rLci2B-NH6) was developed. The rLci2B-NH6 was tightly immobilized on a quartz crystal gold electrode by self-assembled monolayer based on short-chain length thiol. The strategy was the use of the antigen-histidine tail covalently linked to glutaraldehyde performing a Schift base which permits a major exposure of epitopes and a reduced steric hindrance. The immunosensor showed good results regarding sensitivity and reproducibility, being able to distinguish positive and negative canine serum for L. chagasi. Furthermore, the immunosensor can be reused through exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate solution, which promotes the dissociation of antigen-antibody binding, restoring the sensor surface with immobilized biologically active antigens for further analysis.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "date": "2011-06-15", "authors": ["JoilsonRamos-Jesus", "Kellyanne ACarvalho", "Rosana A SFonseca", "Geraldo G SOliveira", "Stella M BarrouinMelo", "Neuza MAlc\u00e2ntara-Neves", "Rosa FDutra"], "doi": "10.1007/s00216-011-5136-7"}
{"title": "Arrays of indefinitely long uniform nanowires and nanotubes.", "abstract": "Nanowires are arguably the most studied nanomaterial model to make functional devices and arrays. Although there is remarkable maturity in the chemical synthesis of complex nanowire structures, their integration and interfacing to macro systems with high yields and repeatability still require elaborate aligning, positioning and interfacing and post-synthesis techniques. Top-down fabrication methods for nanowire production, such as lithography and electrospinning, have not enjoyed comparable growth. Here we report a new thermal size-reduction process to produce well-ordered, globally oriented, indefinitely long nanowire and nanotube arrays with different materials. The new technique involves iterative co-drawing of hermetically sealed multimaterials in compatible polymer matrices similar to fibre drawing. Globally oriented, endlessly parallel, axially and radially uniform semiconducting and piezoelectric nanowire and nanotube arrays hundreds of metres long, with nanowire diameters less than 15 nm, are obtained. The resulting nanostructures are sealed inside a flexible substrate, facilitating the handling of and electrical contacting to the nanowires.

We further elucidate the formation mechanism on the basis of the characterization by freeze fracture transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry characterizations. Furthermore, contact angle measurements of water on PVDF-HFP/graphene indicates that the hydrophobic nature of PVDF-HFP combined with the micro/nanoscale hierarchical texture creates a superhydrophobic surface.

{"title": "Membrane thickness sensitivity of prestin orthologs: the evolution of a piezoelectric protein.", "abstract": "How proteins evolve new functionality is an important question in biology; prestin (SLC26A5) is a case in point. Prestin drives outer hair cell somatic motility and amplifies mechanical vibrations in the mammalian cochlea. The motility of mammalian prestin is analogous to piezoelectricity, in which charge transfer is coupled to changes in membrane area occupied by the protein. Intriguingly, nonmammalian prestin orthologs function as anion exchangers but are apparently nonmotile. We previously found that mammalian prestin is sensitive to membrane thickness, suggesting that prestin's extended conformation has a thinner hydrophobic height in the lipid bilayer. Because prestin-based motility is a mammalian specialization, we initially hypothesized that nonmotile prestin orthologs, while functioning as anion transporters, should be much less sensitive to membrane thickness. We found the exact opposite to be true. Chicken prestin was the most sensitive to thickness changes, displaying the largest shift in voltage dependence. Platypus prestin displayed an intermediate response to membrane thickness and gerbil prestin was the least sensitive. To explain these observations, we present a theory where force production, rather than displacement, was selected for the evolution of prestin as a piezoelectric membrane motor.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2011-06-07", "authors": ["ChisakoIzumi", "Jonathan EBird", "Kuni HIwasa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2011.04.032"}

Dogs in four groups (n = 7-10), were treated daily for a period of 150 days with placebo (Group-I), 10 mg active UC-II (Group-II), 2000 mg GLU + 1600 mg CHO (Group-III), and UC-II + GLU + CHO (Group-IV). On a monthly basis, dogs were evaluated for observational pain (overall pain, pain upon limb manipulation, and pain after physical exertion) using different numeric scales. Pain level was also measured objectively using piezoelectric sensor-based GFP for peak vertical force and impulse area. Dogs were also examined every month for physical, hepatic (ALP, ALT and bilirubin) and renal (BUN and creatinine) functions. Based on observations, significant (p < 0.05) reduction in pain was noted in Group-II, III, and IV dogs. Using GFP, significant increases in peak vertical force (N/kg body wt) and impulse area (N s/kg body wt), indicative of a decrease in arthritis associated pain, were observed in Group-II dogs only. None of the dogs in any group showed changes in physical, hepatic or renal functions. In conclusion, based on GFP data, moderately arthritic dogs treated with UC-II (10 mg) showed a marked reduction in arthritic pain with maximum improvement by day 150.

{"title": "Effect of flexural and torsional wing flexibility on lift generation in hoverfly flight.", "abstract": "The effect of wing flexibility in hoverflies was investigated using an at-scale mechanical model. Unlike dynamically-scaled models, an at-scale model can include all phenomena related to motion and deformation of the wing during flapping. For this purpose, an at-scale polymer wing mimicking a hoverfly was fabricated using a custom micromolding process. The wing has venation and corrugation profiles which mimic those of a hoverfly wing and the measured flexural stiffness of the artificial wing is comparable to that of the natural wing. To emulate the torsional flexibility at the wing-body joint, a discrete flexure hinge was created. A range of flexure stiffnesses was chosen to match the torsional stiffness of pronation and supination in a hoverfly wing. The polymer wing was compared with a rigid, flat, carbon-fiber wing using a flapping mechanism driven by a piezoelectric actuator. Both wings exhibited passive rotation around the wing hinge; however, these rotations were reduced in the case of the compliant polymer wing due to chordwise deformations during flapping which caused a reduced effective angle of attack. Maximum lift was achieved when the stiffness of the hinge was similar to that of a hoverfly in both wing cases and the magnitude of measured lift is sufficient for hovering; the maximum lift achieved by the single polymer and carbon-fiber wings was 5.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910(2)(\u2009)\u03bcN and 6.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910(2)(\u2009)\u03bcN, respectively.

{"title": "A single vibration mode tubular piezoelectric ultrasonic motor.", "abstract": "A novel tubular ultrasonic motor is presented that uses only a single vibration bending mode of a piezoelectric tube to generate rotation. When the piezoelectric tube bends, the diagonal motion of points on selected areas at the ends of the tube generates forces with tangential components along the same circumferential direction, driving the rotors to rotate. Bi-directional motion is achieved by simply switching the direction of bending. Because only one vibration mode is used, the motor requires only one driving signal and no vibration mode coupling is needed, simplifying the design, fabrication, assembly, and operation of the device. Two prototypes [one with cut-in lead zirconate titanate (PZT) teeth and one with added metal teeth] were built and tested using PZT tubes available to the authors. The tubes have an outside diameter of 6.6 mm, inner diameter of 5.0 mm, and length of 25.4 mm. The working frequencies of the two motors are 27.6 and 23.5 kHz.

{"title": "Expected quality factor of a simple tuned oscillator.", "abstract": "A positive feedback system oscillating under self-sustained mode is shown to have an extremely high gain. Modeled as one port, the expected Q is much higher than the loaded Q-factor of the resonator. With just thermal noise present, random phase/frequency deviation is linear. Centered about the oscillator frequency omega/(0), noise frequency on both sides is more amplified with decreasing separation distance. Ultimately, frequency pulling may result in synchronous locking with hysteresis, which occurs because a real oscillator displays a truncated limiting curve. Once locked onto a signal, smaller levels are ignored. A new approach to the design and characterization of a simple tuned oscillator is offered: According to the phenomenon of injection locking, there exists an expected quality factor relating the shape of the truncated limiting curve to an ideal curve. In this paper, synthesis and innovative analytical methods of academic interest are revealed: 1) application of the transducer loss method is revised to establish a new method for oscillator characterization; 2) a transparent method of normalizing a two-port network in the presence of white noise is developed; and 3) in quartz crystal controlled oscillators, characterization of the noise originating from an equivalent noise-resistance determined from parameter of the quartz crystal is proposed. It is shown that the two-port model can also be approximated on a one-port basis.

In addition, we investigated whether it would be possible to predict three key gait events, heel strike, heel lift and toe off, with a relatively straight-forward algorithm. This worked by predicting gait events to occur at fixed time offsets from specific peaks in the sensor signal.\nOur results showed that, for all subjects, the sensor output exhibited the same general characteristics as the ankle joint angle.

It was found that PBS crystal lamellae nucleated and grew confined inside the matrix of PVDF spherulites. Crystallized PBS domains grow with an ellipsoidal outline within PVDF spherulites formed at a relatively high PVDF crystallization temperature (T(c,PVDF)), while circular domains, engulfing several PVDF spherulites, are seen when growing in the PVDF spherulites created at lower T(c,PVDF). The growth kinetics of PBS confined in the PVDF matrix was investigated under various conditions. The growth rate of PBS (G(PBS)) increases with decreasing crystallization temperature and increasing PBS content under a given PVDF crystallization temperature (T(c,VDF)). For T(c,PVDF) above 145 \u00b0C, G(PBS) decreases with T(c,PVDF) for both 50:50 and 30:70 PVDF/PBS blends. However, for T(c,PVDF) below 145 \u00b0C, 50:50 and 30:70 PVDF/PBS blends exhibit the opposite G(PBS) trend; that is, G(PBS) for the 50:50 blend decreases with decreasing T(c,PVDF), while for the 30:70 PVDF/PBS blend G(PBS) increases with decreasing T(c,PVDF). It is shown that this behavior cannot be associated with the effect of crossing the boundary of smaller PVDF spherulites formed at a lower temperature. Rather, the behavior appears to be related to the interleaving growth of PBS lamellae among PVDF lamellae or between bundles of PVDF lamellae (fibrils), as in situ AFM observation shows.

{"title": "A universal piezo-driven ultrasonic cell microinjection system.", "abstract": "Over the past decade, the rapid development of biotechnologies such as gene injection, in-vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and drug development have led to great demand for highly automated, high precision equipment for microinjection. Recently a new cell injection technology using piezo-driven pipettes with a very small mercury column was proposed and successfully applied in ICSI to a variety of mammal species. Although this technique significantly improves the survival rates of the ICSI process, shortcomings due to the toxicity of mercury and damage to the cell membrane due to large lateral tip oscillations of the injector pipette may limit its application. In this paper, a new cell injection system for automatic batch injection of suspended cells is developed. A new design of the piezo-driven cell injector is proposed for automated suspended cell injection. This new piezo-driven cell injector design relocates the piezo oscillation actuator to the injector pipette which eliminates the vibration effect on other parts of the micromanipulator. A small piezo stack is sufficient to perform the cell injection process. Harmful lateral tip oscillations of the injector pipette are reduced substantially without the use of a mercury column. Furthermore, ultrasonic vibration micro-dissection (UVM) theory is utilized to analyze the piezo-driven cell injection process, and the source of the lateral oscillations of the injector pipette is investigated. From preliminary experiments of cell injection of a large number of zebrafish embryos (n\u2009=\u2009200), the injector pipette can easily pierce through the cell membrane at a low injection speed and almost no deformation of the cell wall, and with a high success rate(96%) and survival rate(80.7%) This new injection approach shows good potential for precision injection with less damage to the injected cells.", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2011-05-17", "authors": ["HaiboHuang", "James KMills", "CongLu", "DongSun"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-011-9544-4"}

The developed force sensor array is composed of a flexible polyimide electrode and barium-titanate-based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). The piezoelectric and material properties of industrial-grade MLCCs are ideal for measuring large-force loadings. The sensors are cheap and easy to integrate with automated manufacturing processes. Prior to experimental measurements, the force responses for the MLCC sensor cells were systematically measured and evaluated, confirming their high fracture strength and good sensing properties. Finite element (FE) simulations were used to calculate the force distribution over the tooth crown from the measurement results of the 3\u00d73 force sensor array. Results indicate that the sensor has great sensitivity and linearity under a high-speed cycle loading of 500 N/s conducted to simulate normal chewing. The total force measured using the developed sensor array within the artificial tooth had an error of less than 5%. In addition, the force distributions over the molar crown obtained using a numerical method of FE analysis agree well with those obtained from experiments.

{"title": "Measurement of biaxial mechanical properties of soft tubes and arteries using piezoelectric elements and sonometry.", "abstract": "Arterial elasticity has gained importance in recent decades because it has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular diseases. Several in vivo and ex vivo techniques have been developed to characterize the elastic properties of vessels. In vivo techniques tend to ignore the anisotropy of the mechanical properties in the vessel wall, and therefore fail to characterize elasticity in different directions. Ex vivo techniques have been focused on studying the mechanical properties in different axes. In this paper, we present a technique that uses piezoelectric elements to measure the elasticity of soft tubes and excised arteries in two directions while maintaining the natural structure of these vessels. This technique uses sonometry data from piezoelectric elements to measure the strain in the longitudinal and circumferential directions while the tubes/arteries are being pressurized. We conducted experiments on urethane tubes to evaluate the technique and compared the experimental results with mechanical testing done on the materials used for making the tubes. We then performed sonometry experiments on excised pig carotid arteries assuming that they are transversely isotropic materials. To evaluate the sensitivity of this technique to changes in the material properties, we changed the temperature of the saline bath in which the arteries were immersed. The calculated Young's modulus from sonometry experiments for the urethane tubes and the mechanical testing values showed good agreement, deviating no more than 13.1%. The elasticity values from the excised arteries and the behavior with the temperature changed agreed with previous work done in similar arteries. Therefore, we propose this technique for nondestructive testing of the biaxial properties of soft material tubes and excised arteries in their natural physiological shape.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2011-05-12", "authors": ["MiguelBernal", "Matthew WUrban", "DanielRosario", "WilkinsAquino", "James FGreenleaf"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/56/11/012"}

The mixing enhancement is achieved through interactions between the oscillating bubbles and fluids. Both experimental studies and numerical simulations are conducted.

The relationship between the resulting asymmetric gait and impairments in the ability to properly coordinate the reciprocal stepping activation of the legs is not clear. The objective of this exploratory study is to quantify the effects of hemiparesis on two putatively independent aspects of the bilateral coordination of gait to gain insight into mechanisms and their relationship and to assess their potential as clinical markers.\nTwelve ambulatory stroke patients and age-matched healthy adults wore a tri-axial piezo-resistive accelerometer and walked back and forth along a straight path in a hall at a comfortable walking speed during 2 minutes. Gait speed, gait asymmetry (GA), and aspects of the bilateral coordination of gait (BCG) were determined. Bilateral coordination measures included the left-right stepping phase for each stride \u03c6i, consistency in the phase generation \u03c6_CV, accuracy in the phase generation \u03c6_ABS, and Phase Coordination Index (PCI), a combination of accuracy and consistency of the phase generation.\nGroup differences (p < 0.001) were observed for gait speed (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 versus 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 m/sec for patients and controls, respectively), GA (26.3 \u00b1 5.6 versus 5.5 \u00b1 1.2, correspondingly) and PCI (19.5 \u00b1 2.3 versus 6.2 \u00b1 1.0, correspondingly). A significant correlation between GA and PCI was seen in the stroke patients (r = 0.94; p < 0.001), but not in the controls.\nIn ambulatory post-stroke patients, two gait coordination properties, GA and PCI, are markedly impaired.

Controller parameters definition is addressed and consideration is given to development of the device with integration of a haptic interface.\nResults show better performance of the control-based method (RMSE < 0.1 N), which is also best for reliability, sterilizability, and material dimensions for the application addressed.\nThe control-based method developed for force estimation is compatible with the neurosurgical application and is also capable of measuring tissue resistance without any additional sensors.

To increase the roughness, modified SiO(2) nanoparticles were introduced into PVDF precursor solution. Then in the electrospinning process, nano-sized SiO(2) particles irregularly inlayed (it could also be regard as self-assembly) in the surface of the micro-sized PVDF mini-islands so as to form a dual-scale structure. This structure was responsible for the superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning property. In addition, epoxy-siloxane copolymer was used to modify the surface of SiO(2) nanoparticles so that the SiO(2) nanoparticles could stick to the surface of the micro-sized PVDF mini-islands. Through the underwater immersion test, the SiO(2) nanoparticles cannot be separated from PVDF easily so as to achieve the effect of durability. We chiefly explore the surface wettability and the relationship between the mass ratio of modified SiO(2) nanoparticles/PVDF and the CA, SA of electrospun mat. As the content of modified SiO(2) nanoparticles increased, the value of CA increased, ranging from 145.6\u00b0 to 161.2\u00b0, and the water SA decreased to 2.17\u00b0, apparently indicating that the membrane we fabricated has a perfect effect of superhydrophobicity.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2011-05-04", "authors": ["ShuaiWang", "YapengLi", "XiaoliangFei", "MingdaSun", "ChaoqunZhang", "YaoxianLi", "QingbiaoYang", "XiaHong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2011.04.004"}

However, the conventional assay using a 96-well microtitration plate is time- and sample-consuming, and therefore is not suitable for rapid diagnosis. To overcome these drawbacks, we performed a sandwich ELISA on a microchip.\nThe microchip was made of cyclic olefin copolymer with straight microchannels that were 300 \u00b5m wide and 100 \u00b5m deep. For the construction of a sandwich ELISA for procollagen type I C-peptide (PICP), a biomarker for bone formation, we used a piezoelectric inkjet printing system for the deposition and fixation of the 1st anti-PICP antibody on the surface of the microchannel. After the infusion of the mixture of 2.0 \u00b5l of peroxidase-labeled 2nd anti-PICP antibody and 0.4 \u00b5l of sample to the microchannel and a 30-min incubation, the substrate for peroxidase was infused into the microchannel; and the luminescence intensity of each spot of 1st antibody was measured by CCD camera. A linear relationship was observed between PICP concentration and luminescence intensity over the range of 0 to 600 ng/ml (r(2)\u200a=\u200a0.991), and the detection limit was 4.7 ng/ml. Blood PICP concentrations of 6 subjects estimated from microchip were compared with results obtained by the conventional method. Good correlation was observed between methods according to simple linear regression analysis (R(2)\u200a=\u200a0.9914). The within-day and between-days reproducibilities were 3.2-7.4 and 4.4-6.8%, respectively.

For the most interesting OPE-NDI zipper, one obtains for the dry film a monolayer thickness of 1.85 nm and a density of 1.58 g/cm(3), while the wet film has a larger monolayer thickness of 3.6 nm with a water content of 36%. The dry thickness of a monolayer in OPE-NDI zippers corresponds to about one-half of the length of the OPE scaffold in agreement with the proposed structure of the zipper. The low water content of the OPE-NDI films confirms their compact structure. The dry monolayer thickness of the POP-NDI films of 1.45 nm is smaller than that for the OPE-NDI films, which is probably related to a tilt of the POP scaffolds within the adsorbed layer.

Commercially available multilayer piezoelectric stack actuators are being considered for driving these precision mirror positioning mechanisms. These mechanisms have potential mission operational requirements that exceed 5 years for one mission life. To test the feasibility of using these commercial actuators for these applications and to determine their reliability and the redundancy requirements, a life test study was undertaken. The nominal actuator requirements for the most critical actuators on the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) in terms of number of cycles was estimated from the Modulation Optics Mechanism (MOM) and Pathlength control Optics Mechanism (POM) and these requirements were used to define the study. At a nominal drive frequency of 250 Hz, one mission life is calculated to be 40 billion cycles. In this study, a set of commercial PZT stacks configured in a potential flight actuator configuration (pre-stressed to 18 MPa and bonded in flexures) were tested for up to 100 billion cycles. Each test flexure allowed for two sets of primary and redundant stacks to be mechanically connected in series. The tests were controlled using an automated software control and data acquisition system that set up the test parameters and monitored the waveform of the stack electrical current and voltage. The samples were driven between 0 and 20 V at 2000 Hz to accelerate the life test and mimic the voltage amplitude that is expected to be applied to the stacks during operation. During the life test, 10 primary stacks were driven and 10 redundant stacks, mechanically in series with the driven stacks, were open-circuited. The stroke determined from a strain gauge, the temperature and humidity in the chamber, and the temperature of each individual stack were recorded. Other properties of the stacks, including the displacement from a capacitance gap sensor and impedance spectra were measured at specific intervals. The average degradation in the stroke over the life test was found to be small (<3%) for the primary stacks and <4% for the redundant stacks. It was noted that about half of the stroke reduction occurred within the first 10 billion cycles. At the end of the life test, it was found that the actuator could recover about half of the lost stroke by applying a dc voltage of 100 V at room temperature.

Using dorsal US sonication and Definity, an MB contrast agent, responses of the cortical cerebral vasculature to BBB opening were observed with varying acoustic peak negative pressure (0.071 to 0.25\u2009MPa) under two-photon microscope. Wistar rats with a craniotomy were sonicated with a single piezoelectric transducer following the intravenous injection of Texas Red for visualization of vasculature and leakage from BBB opening. Based on time-dependent intensity change in the extravascular area, the leakage was classified into three types: fast, sustained, and slow. Fast leakage was characterized by a rapid increase to peak intensity during sonication, but a decrease afterwards, occurring at all pressures and vessels sizes analyzed in our study. Sustained leakage was indicated by a similar, immediate increase to peak intensity but one that remained elevated for the duration of imaging, occurring at low-to-intermediate pressures. Slow leakage began 5 to 15\u2009minutes after sonication, dominating at low pressures, and was more prevalent among smaller vessels than fast and sustained leakage.

We have developed a computer simulation that accurately portrays actual conditions and the results from these simulations are corroborated by the experimental data. These computer simulations can be used to predict outcomes from future designs resulting in a design process that is efficient in terms of financial cost and time.

The top of the chamber is a thin diaphragm which, when deflected, causes the volume of the fluid-filled cylindrical chamber to change thereby causing fluid in the chamber to flow in and out of the micropipette. This enables aspirating and dispensing individual living cells. The diaphragm is deflected by a piezoelectric actuator that pushes against its center. The pump aspirates and dispenses volumes of fluid between 500 pL and 250 nL at flow rates up to 250 nL/s.

As the main target for neutralizing antibodies, HA is currently used as the influenza vaccine potency marker and is measured by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID)(3). However, the dependence of SRID on the availability of the corresponding subtype-specific antisera causes a minimum of 2-3 months delay for the release of every new vaccine. Moreover, despite evidence that NA also induces protective immunity(4), the amount of NA in influenza vaccines is not yet standardized due to a lack of appropriate reagents or analytical method(5). Thus, simple alternative methods capable of quantifying HA and NA antigens are desirable for rapid release and better quality control of influenza vaccines. Universally conserved regions in all available influenza A HA and NA sequences were identified by bioinformatics analyses(6-7). One sequence (designated as Uni-1) was identified in the only universally conserved epitope of HA, the fusion peptide(6), while two conserved sequences were identified in neuraminidases, one close to the enzymatic active site (designated as HCA-2) and the other close to the N-terminus (designated as HCA-3)(7). Peptides with these amino acid sequences were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits for the production of antibodies. The antibody against the Uni-1 epitope of HA was able to bind to 13 subtypes of influenza A HA (H1-H13) while the antibodies against the HCA-2 and HCA-3 regions of NA were capable of binding all 9 NA subtypes. All antibodies showed remarkable specificity against the viral sequences as evidenced by the observation that no cross-reactivity to allantoic proteins was detected. These universal antibodies were then used to develop slot blot assays to quantify HA and NA in influenza A vaccines without the need for specific antisera(7,8). Vaccine samples were applied onto a PVDF membrane using a slot blot apparatus along with reference standards diluted to various concentrations. For the detection of HA, samples and standard were first diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 4M urea while for the measurement of NA they were diluted in TBS containing 0.01% Zwittergent as these conditions significantly improved the detection sensitivity. Following the detection of the HA and NA antigens by immunoblotting with their respective universal antibodies, signal intensities were quantified by densitometry. Amounts of HA and NA in the vaccines were then calculated using a standard curve established with the signal intensities of the various concentrations of the references used. Given that these antibodies bind to universal epitopes in HA or NA, interested investigators could use them as research tools in immunoassays other than the slot blot only.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2011-04-15", "authors": ["CarolineGravel", "ChangguiLi", "JunzhiWang", "Anwar MHashem", "BozenaJaentschke", "GaryVan Domselaar", "RuntaoHe", "XuguangLi"], "doi": "10.3791/2784"}

OP was performed using a Kistler 9286A piezoelectric force plate and the following postural parameters (PPs) were adopted on account of their functional meaning: mean velocity and the root mean square of the distance of the centre of pressure (CoP), sway area, and 95% of the CoP power frequency. Eye condition and fatigue related to the test duration were also examined. The three most meaningful PPs were identified and a logarithmic transformation was then applied to these, as well as standardization. Almost all the PP values were higher preoperatively in the patients as compared with the healthy subjects and it was possible to detect many statistically significant differences between patients and healthy subjects. However, when examining the 181 subjects at the preoperative stage, the PPs did not show congruence with the clinical scores as well as they did during follow-up. Therefore, the use of the OP is not recommended to monitor patients undergoing THA or TKA.", "journal": "Gait & posture", "date": "2011-04-13", "authors": ["LivioQuagliarella", "NicolaSasanelli", "VMonaco", "GBelgiovine", "ASpinarelli", "ANotarnicola", "LMoretti", "BMoretti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gaitpost.2011.03.010"}

Recently, a bio-sensing system has been produced by analysis of the attachment of antibody using alkanethiols, to form SAMs on the face of Au-quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) surfaces. In this study, the attachment of anti-\u03b1-fetoprotein monoclonal antibody to a SAMs surface of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid was achieved using water-soluble N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide as coupling agents. Surface analyses were utilized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The quantization of immobilized antibody was characterized by the frequency shift of QCM and the radioactivity change of \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I labeled antibody. The limit of detection and linear range of the calibration curve of the QCM method were 15 ng/ml and 15-850 ng/ml. The correlation coefficients of \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration between QCM and radioimmunoassay were 0.9903 and 0.9750 for the standards and serum samples, respectively.

The membrane was characterized by SEM, (13)C NMR and FTIR techniques. Quantitative adsorption experiments were performed in view of pH, contact time, temperature, the presence of Ca(II) and lactic acid as the controlling parameters. Adsorption kinetics and equilibrium were examined regarding the single Ni(II) system, binary Ni(II) and Ca(II) system and nickel-lactic acid complexes system. The desorption efficiency was also evaluated, and the adsorption mechanism was suggested based on experimental data. The results show that the sorption kinetics fit well to Lagergren second-order equation and the isotherms can be well described by Langmuir model. At 298 K, the second-order rate constant is calculated to be 4.171, 11.39, 6.203 cm(2)/(mg min) and the equilibrium uptake is 0.0264, 0.0211 and 0.0216 mg/cm(2) in the aforementioned three systems.

{"title": "Sensitive and selective DNA detection based on the combination of hairpin-type probe with endonuclease/GNP signal amplification using quartz-crystal-microbalance transduction.", "abstract": "In order to develop a highly sensitive and selective piezoelectric transducer for the detection of DNA, the bio-recognizing probe is for the first time designed by introducing a hairpin structure and a recognition site for EcoRI into an oligonucleotide sequence and signal amplifiers are prepared by modifying gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with biomolecules, deepening the application and understanding of biomaterials. The piezoelectric transducer is prepared by immobilizing designed hairpin recognition probe onto the quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM). In the absence of target DNA, the hairpin probe is removed from the QCM surface after exposure to endonuclease, inhibiting the subsequent signaling reaction. In contrast, introduction of target DNA can open the hairpin probe due to the probe/target hybridization, dissociating the cleavable double-stranded portion. In this case, even if being treated with endonuclease, the integrated hairpin probe is maintained. Subsequent introduction of GNPs modified with detection probes that can hybridize to the terminal sequence of hairpin probe results in a many-folds increase of the frequency response.

{"title": "A new method for wideband characterization of resonator-based sensing platforms.", "abstract": "A new approach to the electronic instrumentation for extracting data from resonator-based sensing devices (e.g., microelectromechanical, piezoelectric, electrochemical, and acoustic) is suggested and demonstrated here. Traditionally, oscillator-based circuitry is employed to monitor shift in the resonance frequency of the resonator. These circuits give a single point measurement at the frequency where the oscillation criterion is met. However, the resonator response itself is broadband and contains much more information than a single point measurement. Here, we present a method for the broadband characterization of a resonator using white noise as an excitation signal. The resonator is used in a two-port filter configuration, and the resonator output is subjected to frequency spectrum analysis. The result is a wideband spectral map analogous to the magnitude of the S21 parameters of a conventional filter. Compared to other sources for broadband excitation (e.g., frequency chirp, multisine, or narrow time domain pulse), the white noise source requires no design of the input signal and is readily available for very wide bandwidths (1 MHz-3 GHz). Moreover, it offers simplicity in circuit design as it does not require precise impedance matching; whereas such requirements are very strict for oscillator-based circuit systems, and can be difficult to fulfill. This results in a measurement system that does not require calibration, which is a significant advantage over oscillator circuits. Simulation results are first presented for verification of the proposed system, followed by measurement results with a prototype implementation. A 434 MHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator and a 5 MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) are measured using the proposed method, and the results are compared to measurements taken by a conventional bench-top network analyzer. Maximum relative differences in the measured resonance frequencies of the SAW and QCM resonators are 0.0004% and 0.002%, respectively. The ability to track a changing sensor response is demonstrated by inducing temperature variations and measuring resonance frequency simultaneously using the proposed technique in parallel with a network analyzer. The relative difference between the two measurements is about 5.53 ppm, highlighting the impressive accuracy of the proposed system. Using commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs), we believe that this technique can be implemented as a system-on-a-chip solution resulting in a very low cost, easy to use, portable, and customizable sensing system. In addition, given the simplicity of the signal and circuit design, and its immunity to other common interface concerns (injection locking, oscillator interference, and drift, etc.), this method is better suited to accommodating array-based systems.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2011-04-05", "authors": ["FarasatMunir", "AdamWathen", "William DHunt"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3567005\n10.1007/BF01337937\n10.1016/S0925-4005(01)00856-5\n10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00531-X\n10.1109/LED.2007.914085\n10.1016/j.snb.2005.04.047\n10.1088/0957-0233/20/12/124011\n10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00451-5\n10.1109/TUFFC.2002.1041542\n10.1016/0925-4005(96)80121-3\n10.1088/0957-0233/12/4/318\n10.1063/1.1150649\n10.1109/58.330261\n10.1063/1.1147494\n10.1021/ac001065n\n10.1063/1.1370560\n10.1109/JSEN.2006.877977\n10.1088/0022-3735/20/5/011\n10.1002/pmic.200500093\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2009.11.005\n10.1021/nl052134m\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.03.086\n10.1109/TMTT.2006.872947\n10.1021/la035965l\n10.1021/ac981272b\n10.1088/0022-3727/30/3/006\n10.1063/1.370999\n10.1063/1.1358317\n10.1063/1.1145396\n10.1238/Physica.Regular.059a00391\n10.1021/ac8019762\n10.1109/58.156181"}
{"title": "A technique for combined dynamic compression-shear test.", "abstract": "It is critically important to study the dynamic response of materials under a combined compression-shear loading for developing constitutive laws more accurately and fully. We present a novel technique to achieve the combined compression and shear loadings at high strain rates. The main apparatus consists of a strike bar, an incident bar, and two transmission bars. The close-to-specimen end of the incident bar is wedge-shaped with 90\u00b0. In each experiment, there are two identical specimens, respectively, agglutinated between one side of the wedge and one of transmission bars. When a loading impulse travels to specimens along the incident bar, because of the special geometrical shape, the specimen-incident bar interface gets an axial and a transverse velocity. Specimens endure a combined compression-shear loading at high strain rates. The compression stress and strain of the specimens are deduced from signals recorded by strain gages mounted on the bars. The shear stress is measured by two piezoelectric transducers of quartz (Y-cut with rotation angle 17.7\u00b0) embedded at the close-to-specimen end of transmission bars; the shear strain is measured with a novel optical technique, which is based on the luminous flux method. An analytic model was proposed and validated by the numerical simulations. The simulation results yield good agreement with the analytic results.

{"title": "Application of 3 \u00d7 3 transformation matrix in the correction of three-dimensional AFM image tilts through coordinate transformation.", "abstract": "In atomic force microscopy (AFM), it is difficult to maintain samples in a perfect horizontal position on the piezoelectric stage of an AFM to obtain accurate measurement of surface features and to enhance the visual effect of topographic images. Correction of the tilted image therefore requires the use of an appropriate 3 \u00d7 3 transformation matrix which will transform the coordinates to simultaneously correct the tilt in both the x-and y-axes due to the three-dimensional nature of AFM images. In this study, application of transformation matrix in three-dimensions for the simultaneous correction of image tilts in both the x- and y-axes by the method of coordinate transformation in three-dimensions is presented. Application of the matrix in simultaneously correcting tilts in the x- and y-axes of an AFM image is implemented by simulating an image assuming there are tilts in both the x- and y-axes. Results of features measurement after transforming the coordinates with the matrix show the efficacy of the matrix. This will conveniently replace the line-by-line analysis done to remove tilts in AFM, which has been the practice long before now. It also has the advantage of correcting images by simultaneously removing tilts in both the x- and y-axes as a veritable replacement of having to separately correcting tilts in images.

Network-like and brush-like PEGylated layers on PVDF membrane surfaces were achieved by low-pressure and atmospheric plasma treatment. The chemical composition, physical morphology, grafting structure, surface hydrophilicity, and hydration capability of prepared membranes were determined to illustrate the correlations between grafting qualities and hemocompatibility of PEGylated PVDF membranes in contact with human blood. Plasma protein adsorption onto different PEGylated PVDF membranes from single-protein solutions and the complex medium of 100% human plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies. Hemocompatibility of the PEGylated membranes was evaluated by the antifouling property of platelet adhesion observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the anticoagulant activity of the blood coagulant determined by testing plasma-clotting time. The control of grafting structures of PEGylated layers highly regulates the PVDF membrane to resist the adsorption of plasma proteins, the adhesion of platelets, and the coagulation of human plasma. It was found that PVDF membranes grafted with brush-like PEGylated layers presented higher hydration capability with binding water molecules than with network-like PEGylated layers to improve the hemocompatible character of plasma protein and blood platelet resistance in human blood.

The inflection lines are detected using the voltage phase. In the external resistor design step, the resistor values are found for each segment to maximize power output.

Appropriate excitation frequencies and modes for inspection are selected from theoretical and experimental dispersion curves. Dispersion curves are obtained experimentally by short time Fourier transform of the transient signals. Sensitivity of antisymmetric and symmetric modes for delamination detection are investigated. The antisymmetric mode is found to be more reliable for delamination detection. Unlike other studies, in which the attenuation of the propagating waves is related to the extent of the internal damage, in this investigation, the changes in the time-of-flight (TOF) of guided Lamb waves are related to the damage progression. The mode conversion phenomenon of Lamb waves during progressive delamination is investigated.

Among the proposed solutions (for instance, single crystal), it has been shown that applying a simple and low-cost nonlinear treatment to the voltage output can significantly increase the conversion abilities of such materials. However, such an approach also adds significant electrical losses, dramatically reducing the available electric energy generated from the mechanical excitation. Such an observation is even more important when the energy in the system is limited, for example when the structure is submitted to a pulsed excitation. The purpose of this paper is to describe an efficient approach for reducing such losses, based on the transfer of the electrostatic energy when it starts to decrease.

Theoretical impulse responses are derived from a propagation model of bending waves in a thin elastic plate. On the basis of the impulse responses, the time-reversal technique is exploited to spot the impact location as well as to generate haptic feedback. The chief advantage of the time-reversal technique lies in its robustness of tackling broadband sources in a reverberant environment. Piezoelectric ceramic plates and voice-coil motors are used as sensors for localization, whereas only voice-coil motors are used as the actuator for haptic feedback. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed system was effective in precise impact localization for a thin panel, while haptic feedback also implemented using time-reversal principle can generate an impulse at the previously touched position.

{"title": "Magnetization dynamics, Bennett clocking and associated energy dissipation in multiferroic logic.", "abstract": "It has been recently shown that the magnetization of a multiferroic nanomagnet, consisting of a magnetostrictive layer elastically coupled to a piezoelectric layer, can be rotated by a large angle if a tiny voltage of a few tens of millivolts is applied to the piezoelectric layer. The potential generates stress in the magnetostrictive layer and rotates its magnetization by ~90\u00b0 to implement Bennett clocking in nanomagnetic logic chains. Because of the small voltage needed, this clocking method is far more energy efficient than those that would employ spin transfer torque or magnetic fields to rotate the magnetization. In order to assess if such a clocking scheme can also be reasonably fast, we have studied the magnetization dynamics of a multiferroic logic chain with nearest-neighbor dipole coupling using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. We find that clock rates of 2.5 GHz are feasible while still maintaining the exceptionally high energy efficiency. For this clock rate, the energy dissipated per clock cycle per bit flip is ~52,000 kT at room temperature in the clocking circuit for properly designed nanomagnets. Had we used spin transfer torque to clock at the same rate, the energy dissipated per clock cycle per bit flip would have been ~4 x 10\u2078 kT, while with current transistor technology we would have expended ~10\u2076 kT. For slower clock rates of 1 GHz, stress-based clocking will dissipate only ~200 kT of energy per clock cycle per bit flip, while spin transfer torque would dissipate about 10\u2078 kT. This shows that multiferroic nanomagnetic logic, clocked with voltage-generated stress, can emerge as a very attractive technique for computing and signal processing since it can be several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than current technologies.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2011-03-11", "authors": ["Mohammad SalehiFashami", "KuntalRoy", "JayasimhaAtulasimha", "SupriyoBandyopadhyay"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/22/15/155201"}

The effect of surface composition and graft morphology, electrical neutrality, hydrophilicity and hydration capability on blood compatibility of the membranes were determined. Blood compatibility of the zwitterionic PVDF membranes was systematically evaluated by plasma protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, plasma-clotting time, and blood cell hemolysis. It was found that the nonfouling nature and hydration capability of grafted PSBMA polymers can be effectively controlled by regulating the grafting coverage and charge balance of the PSBMA layer on the PVDF membrane surface. Even a slight charge bias in the grafted zwitterionic PSBMA layer can induce electrostatic interactions between proteins and the membrane surfaces, leading to surface protein adsorption, platelet activation, plasma clotting and blood cell hemolysis.

Different types of voice-coil- and piezo-driven membrane actuators, as well as active-wall actuators, located between the reference and error sensors, were demonstrated to be effective in introducing counter-waves into the boundary layer to cancel the travelling TS waves.

The system can respond at frequencies up to 30 Hz with a high position detection accuracy. With the beam stabilization system, we have achieved a laser beam pointing stability within a range of 2 \u03bcrad (horizontal) to 4 \u03bcrad (vertical), corresponding to beam drifts of only 0.5 mm \u00d7 1 mm at the furthest measurement station located 250 meters away from the light source.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2011-03-04", "authors": ["Robert AHardin", "YunLiu", "CaryLong", "AlexanderAleksandrov", "WillemBlokland"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.19.002874"}
{"title": "Active control of transmission loss with smart foams.", "abstract": "Smart foams combine the complimentary advantages of passive foam material and spatially distributed piezoelectric actuator embedded in it for active noise control applications. In this paper, the problem of improving the transmission loss of smart foams using active control strategies has been investigated both numerically and experimentally inside a waveguide under the condition of plane wave propagation. The finite element simulation of a coupled noise control system has been undertaken with three different smart foam designs and their effectiveness in cancelling the transmitted wave downstream of the smart foam have been studied. The simulation results provide insight into the physical phenomenon of active noise cancellation and explain the impact of the smart foam designs on the optimal active control results. Experimental studies aimed at implementing the real-time control for transmission loss optimization have been performed using the classical single input/single output filtered-reference least mean squares algorithm. The active control results with broadband and single frequency primary source inputs demonstrate a good improvement in the transmission loss of the smart foams.

Graft polymerization on membrane surfaces, in general, and grafting with oppositely charged monomers, have been shown to reduce biofouling significantly. In this study, surface forces and macromolecular properties of graft copolymers that possess oppositely charged groups were related to their potent antibiofouling behavior. Graft polymerization was performed using the negatively charged 3-sulphopropyl methacrylate (SPM) and positively charged [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]-trimethylammonium (MOETMA) monomers to yield a copolymer layer on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) surface. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technology was used to monitor the reduced adsorption of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) wastewater treatment facility. Complemented measurements of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy provided evaluation of the antifouling properties of the surface. Increase in water content in grafted layer exposed to 100 mM aqueous NaCl solution was observed by QCM-D. Therefore, the grafted copolymer layer is swelled in the presence of 100 mM NaCl because of reversing of polymer self-association by counterions. Force measurements by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed an increased repulsion between a carboxylate-modified latex (CML) particle probe and a modified PVDF surface, especially in the presence of 100 mM NaCl. The hydration and swelling of the grafted polymer layer are shown to repel EPS and reduce their adsorption.

To model the interactions of surfactants with the barrier lipids of the stratum corneum (SC), it is essential to develop in vitro and in vivo quantitative measurement methods to predict, evaluate, and demonstrate the effect of the different surfactant chemistries and technologies on skin. In the current work, in vitro water vapor uptake and surfactant absorption onto skin lipid model films were quantitatively studied using a technique based on the piezoelectric effect, the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). This approach is straightforward and reliable in providing subtle surface/interface related mass change information with high resolution and sensitivity. The results show that barrier properties of the lipid model system may be damaged by surfactant absorption, as well as by long-term water exposure due to alterations to the lipid film structure. Surfactant absorption is found to be concentration dependent even beyond its critical micelle concentration (CMC).

{"title": "Optoacoustic methods for frequency calibration of ultrasonic sensors.", "abstract": "The frequency response of ultrasonic detectors is commonly calibrated by finding their sensitivity to incident plane waves at discrete frequencies. For certain applications, such as the emerging field of optoacoustic tomography, it is the response to point sources emitting broadband spectra that needs to be found instead. Although these two distinct sensitivity characteristics are interchangeable in the case of a flat detector and a point source at infinity, it is not the case for detectors with size considerably larger than the acoustic wavelength of interest or those having a focused aperture. Such geometries, which are common in optoacoustics, require direct calibration of the acoustic detector using a point source placed in the relevant position. In this paper, we report on novel cross-validating optoacoustic methods for measuring the frequency response of wideband acoustic sensors. The approach developed does not require pre-calibrated hydrophones and therefore can be readily adopted in any existing optoacoustic measurement configuration.

The utility of two different drawing techniques, zone drawing and water immersion drawing were investigated for processing the silk for piezoelectric studies. Silk films zone drawn to a ratio of \u03bb= 2.7 displayed relatively high dynamic shear piezoelectric coefficients of d(14) = -1.5 pC/N, corresponding to over two orders of magnitude increase in d(14) due to film drawing. A strong correlation was observed between the increase in the silk II, \u03b2-sheet content with increasing draw ratio measured by FTIR spectroscopy (C(\u03b2)\u221d e(2.5) (\u03bb)), the concomitant increasing degree of orientation of \u03b2-sheet crystals detected via WAXD (FWHM = 0.22\u00b0 for \u03bb= 2.7), and the improvement in silk piezoelectricity (d(14)\u221d e(2.4) (\u03bb)). Water immersion drawing led to a predominantly silk I structure with a low degree of orientation (FWHM = 75\u00b0) and a much weaker piezoelectric response compared to zone drawing. Similarly, increasing the \u03b2-sheet crystallinity without inducing crystal alignment, e.g. by methanol treatment, did not result in a significant enhancement of silk piezoelectricity.

Blood and urine parameters were assessed periodically while clinical evaluation incorporating a validated veterinary pain scale was performed daily.\nConventional transrectal ultrasound facilitated targeting of the focal volume and provided real-time assessment of cavitation activity. Fractionation of the targeted volume and clearance of the resultant debris with urination produced a treatment cavity in each prostate. No acoustic collateral damage was seen and urothelialization of the treatment cavity developed within 28 days of treatment. Only transient laboratory value abnormalities and minimal hematuria were noted after treatment. Pain scores revealed only mild posttreatment discomfort.\nHistotripsy produced consistent tissue fractionation and prostate debulking without collateral acoustic injury or clinical side effects and it was well tolerated in the canine model.", "journal": "The Journal of urology", "date": "2011-02-22", "authors": ["Christopher RHempel", "Timothy LHall", "Charles ACain", "J BrianFowlkes", "ZhenXu", "William WRoberts"], "doi": "10.1016/j.juro.2010.11.044"}
{"title": "Wire-in-a-nozzle as a new droplet-on-demand electrogenerator.", "abstract": "Many engineering applications assume the generation of single spherical droplets on demand. Piezo and thermo droplet-on-demand (DOD) instruments are not able to produce droplets with a broad range of size distributions from the same nozzle. We show that this challenge can be resolved using the principles of electrostatic generation and capillarity. A thin conductive wire threaded through a needle can be used as the droplet electrogenerator (or DOD generator). By applying a weak-bias electric field, one can deliver a drop from the needle edge to the free wire tip. When the drop moves toward the wire tip, it leaves behind a thin coating film. The capillary pressure of this cylindrical film helps isolate the droplet from the liquid source: the film spontaneously thins, breaking the connection between the droplet and the liquid source. The detachment of a pendant drop from the wire is then achieved by applying a short voltage pulse. Using the wire-in-a-needle nozzle, we were able to produce single droplets ranging from 50 to 500 \u03bcm, and we were able to deposit them with controlled velocity in a prescribed position. Therefore, the proposed method offers new opportunities in fields dealing with the DOD applications.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2011-02-22", "authors": ["TarasAndrukh", "BinyaminRubin", "Konstantin GKornev"], "doi": "10.1021/la104855b"}

The objective of this study was to compare the severity of pain over the first 10 postoperative days in a group of 70 patients who underwent intact canal wall mastoidectomy, with the piezoelectric device, and to compare the results with traditional method by means of microdrill (70 patients). The subjective perception of pain was evaluated on a scale from 0 to 10, such that 0 represented no pain and 10 represented maximum pain; the severity was recorded as null when the score was 0; slight, when it was 1-4; moderate, when it was 5-7; or severe, when it was 8-10. Compared with microdrill, the patients that underwent surgery with the piezoelectric device showed a significant (P < 0.05) lower postoperative pain on day 1 (52 vs. 26 patients presented a slight pain, 12 vs. 37 presented a moderate pain, and 6 vs. 7 presented a severe pain) and day 3 (68 vs. 44 patients presented a slight pain, 2 vs. 23 presented a moderate pain, and 0 vs. 3 presented a severe pain).

The aims of this study were to determine, in 10 asymptomatic subjects who are chewing gum, (i) jerk-cost measures derived from displacement/time data obtained from the JAWS3D jaw-tracking device and from acceleration data obtained from a TPA used in the same jaw movement recordings, (ii) whether there was a significant relationship between jerk-cost measures derived from both devices and (iii) the degree of agreement between the two measures. Jerk-cost data were calculated in the opening phase, the closing phase, and over the full chewing cycle as the first-time derivative from acceleration obtained from the TPA, and the third-time derivative from JAWS3D for each of the X-, Y- and Z-direction series. There was a significant correlation between both measures of jerk-cost over the full chewing cycle and during jaw-opening (r = 0\u00b765, 0\u00b775, respectively; P < 0\u00b7001). There was no significant correlation in the closing phase (r = -0\u00b702, P = 0\u00b799). The Bland-Altman test showed that jerk-cost derived from the JAWS3D can differ by up to 78% below and 21% above that derived from the TPA.

Of particular interest are devices which can conform to irregular, curved surfaces, and operate in vital environments that may involve both flexing and stretching modes. Previous studies have shown significant advances in the integration of highly efficient piezoelectric nanocrystals on flexible and bendable substrates. Yet, such inorganic nanomaterials are mechanically incompatible with the extreme elasticity of elastomeric substrates. Here, we present a novel strategy for overcoming these limitations, by generating wavy piezoelectric ribbons on silicone rubber. Our results show that the amplitudes in the waves accommodate order-of-magnitude increases in maximum tensile strain without fracture. Further, local probing of the buckled ribbons reveals an enhancement in the piezoelectric effect of up to 70%, thus representing the highest reported piezoelectric response on a stretchable medium. These results allow for the integration of energy conversion devices which operate in stretching mode via reversible deformations in the wavy/buckled ribbons.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2011-02-17", "authors": ["YiQi", "JihoonKim", "Thanh DNguyen", "BozhenaLisko", "Prashant KPurohit", "Michael CMcAlpine"], "doi": "10.1021/nl104412b"}

The volumetric productivity of pyruvic acid increased up to 4.2\u00a0g/l/h, about four times higher than that of batch fermentation. Moreover, the membrane was able to filter fermentation broth for more than 300\u00a0h without fouling even though the cell density of the fermentation broth reached 600 as OD(660).

A secondary purpose was to compare the accuracy the Omron to that of a spring-levered pedometer.\nA total of 62 adult volunteers were classified according to body mass index (BMI) category: normal weight (n = 19), overweight (n = 23), and obese (n = 20). Subjects wore five devices during a 24-h period except when bathing or sleeping. The criterion pedometer (StepWatch-3) was worn on the lateral side of the right ankle. Omron HJ-720ITC pedometers were worn in three locations: (a) on the belt, (b) in the pants pocket, and (c) on a lanyard around the neck. A comparison pedometer (Yamax SW-200) was worn on the belt.\nThe Omron HJ-720ITC underestimated the steps per day in all three BMI categories compared with the criterion measure (P < 0.05). The Omron was most accurate in the pocket location, recording 68%, 70%, and 65% of steps in the normal, overweight, and obese BMI categories, respectively. In the obese group, the Omron was more accurate than the Yamax pedometer, but in the normal and overweight groups, it was less accurate than the Yamax.\nResults from our study show that the Omron significantly underestimates steps per day under free-living conditions. This is due, in part, to the presence of a 4-s step filter that contributes to an underestimation of steps accumulated during intermittent activities. In the pocket, the Omron accuracy was similar for lean, overweight, and obese individuals. In contrast, the accuracy of the Yamax pedometer declined with increasing BMI categories.", "journal": "Medicine and science in sports and exercise", "date": "2011-02-12", "authors": ["Nathan ASilcott", "David RBassett", "Dixie LThompson", "Eugene CFitzhugh", "Jeremy ASteeves"], "doi": "10.1249/MSS.0b013e318212888c"}

Using the first principle calculations, we show that compressive strains can induce and enhance the polarization in ferroelectric tunnel barriers, and practically achieve ferroelectricity in two unit cell thickness under a -2.2% compressive strain. More importantly, mechanical strains can significantly change the effective electrostatic potential in FTJ and thus control its tunneling conductance, which is defined as giant piezoelectric resistance (GPR) effect. Our calculations indicate that GPR effect is particularly significant near the paraelectric/ferroelectric phase transition, and increases exponentially with the barrier thickness. Furthermore, it is also found that defects of oxygen vacancies and nitrogen doping have little impact on GPR ratio of strained FTJ. Because of its high-sensitivity to external mechanical loads, FTJ with GPR effect should be adequate for applications in agile mechanical sensors, transducers, and other multifunctional devices.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2011-02-12", "authors": ["XinLuo", "BiaoWang", "YueZheng"], "doi": "10.1021/nn1031438"}

In order to study the surface changes in spermatozoa during their maturation in the epididymis, we previously established several monoclonal antibodies against the 54kDa sialoglycoprotein of mouse cauda epididymal spermatozoa, which gradually increased the expression of antigenic determinants during epididymal transit. One of these monoclonal antibodies, MC121, reacted with mouse sperm glycoproteins on a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane after desialylation of the glycoproteins, and the treatment of the desialylated sperm glycoproteins with \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase greatly decreased the expression of the antigenic determinants. In addition to reacting with mouse cauda epididymal spermatozoa, MC121 reacted with human red blood cells (hRBCs). MC121 induced agglutination of sialidase-treated hRBCs and stained hRBCs fixed with formalin vapor much more heavily than it stained hRBCs fixed with methanol. The thin layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining of the sialidase-treated lipids of hRBCs with MC121 suggested that the epitope-bearing molecule is a glycosphingolipids (GSL), and that MC121 reacts with a pentaose-GSL. Analysis of sialidase-treated GSLs by TLC-Blot-Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) revealed that the GSL bound by MC121 was [HexNAc][HexNAc+Hex][Hex][Hex]-Cer.

Various smart foam prototypes were built and tested in active absorption experiments conducted in an impedance tube under plane wave propagation condition at frequencies between 100 and 1500 Hz. Three control cases were tested. The first case used a fixed controller derived in the frequency domain from estimations of the primary disturbance at a directive microphone position in the tube and the transfer function between the control PVDF and the directive microphone. The two other cases used an adaptive time-domain feedforward controller to absorb either a single-frequency incident wave or a broadband incident wave. The non-linearity of the smart foams and the causality constraint were identified to be important factors influencing active control performance.

A technique capable of early diagnosis, process monitoring, and evaluation of the role of different foulants playing in the fouling process is crucial for the fouling control. We develop surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a new and versatile tool to investigate the fouling process of protein on PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membranes as well as the fouling propensity of three different proteins. We optimized the aggregation level and volume of SERS-active Ag sol and the spectra acquisition method combined with a statistical analysis method to ensure a high detection sensitivity, signal uniformity, and stability. We then used SERS for the early diagnosis of the fouling process and determining when the membrane pores would be blocked. The fouled area was visualized by a combination of the silver staining and Raman mapping. The fouling propensity of different proteins was studied by comparing the relative SERS band intensities of different proteins on a glass slide and after membrane filtration.

{"title": "DNA hybridization enhancement using piezoelectric microagitation through a liquid coupling medium.", "abstract": "In conventional DNA microarray hybridization, delivery of target cDNAs to surface-bounded probes depends solely on diffusion, which is notoriously slow, and thus typically requires 6-20 h to complete. In this study, piezoelectric microagitation through a liquid coupling medium is employed to enhance DNA hybridization efficiency and the results are compared with the standard static hybridization method. DNA hybridization was performed in a sealed aluminium chamber containing DNA microarray glass chip, coupling medium and piezoelectric transducers. 3\u00d7SSC (Saline Sodium Citrate) was used as a coupling medium to prevent overheating of the piezoelectric transducers and to effectively transmit ultrasonic wave to the glass chip. Flow visualization using fluidic dye and velocimetry (PTV) technique was applied to observe fluid transport in the hybridization chamber. It was revealed that the dye solution was homogeneously distributed within 10 min under dynamic agitation while it took over 1 h to reach the same level of homogeneity in static condition. Plasmodium falciparum DNA microarrays and total RNA extracted from parasite cells were used as a model for DNA microarray experiments. It was found that the required hybridization time may be substantially reduced from 16 h to 4 h by the use of dynamic hybridization scheme. With the same hybridization time of 16 h, dynamic hybridization resulted in higher fluorescent signals of \u223c33% and \u223c24% compared to static hybridization in Cy3 and Cy5 channels, respectively. Additionally, good/effective spots, some of which were not formed by static method, were enhanced and distributed more uniformly over the microarray.

As the primary site of action of paracetamol is still the subject of ongoing discussion, the focus of this study is the investigation of a potential mechanism which might contribute to its beneficial effects in the therapy of pain. Loss of inhibitory synaptic transmission within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays a key role in the development of pain following inflammation or nerve injury. Inhibitory postsynaptic transmission in the adult spinal cord involves mainly glycine. In this study we investigated the interaction of paracetamol with strychnine-sensitive \u03b1(1)-glycine receptors (\u03b1(1)-GlyR). \u03b1(1)-GlyR subunits transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells were studied using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and a piezo-controlled liquid filament fast application system.

In this work, a high-speed PAI system has been developed using a commercial US unit and a custom built 128-element piezoelectric-polymer array (PPA) probe using a P(VDF-TrFE) film and flexible circuit to define the elements. Since the US unit supports simultaneous signal acquisition from 64 parallel receive channels, PAI data for synthetic image formation from a 64- or 128-element array aperture can be acquired after a single or dual laser firing, respectively.

The probe is an insulated, sharpened metal wire with a small platinum-black tip (30-35 \u03bcm), which can detect ionic currents in the \u03bcA/cm(2) range in physiological saline. The probe is vibrated at about 200 Hz by a piezoelectric bender. In the presence of an ionic current, the probe detects a voltage difference between the extremes of its movement. A lock-in amplifier filters out extraneous noise by locking on to the probe's frequency of vibration. Data are recorded onto computer.

An interdigital bonded (IB) 1-3 composite was prepared using two IB operations on a fine-grain piezoelectric ceramic. The final composite had 19-\u03bcm-wide posts separated by 6-\u03bcm-wide polymer kerfs. A novel method to remove metal electrodes from polymer portions of the 1-3 composite was established to eliminate the need for patterning and aligning the electrode on the composite to the electrodes on a flexible circuit. Unloaded epoxy was used for both the matching and backing layers and a flexible circuit was used for interconnect. A prototype array was successfully fabricated and tested. The results were in reasonable agreement with those predicted by a circuit-analogous model. The average center frequency estimated from the measured pulse-echo responses of array elements was 33.5 MHz and the -6-dB fractional bandwidth was 57%.

{"title": "High-temperature (>500\u00b0c) wall thickness monitoring using dry-coupled ultrasonic waveguide transducers.", "abstract": "Conventional ultrasonic transducers cannot withstand high temperatures for two main reasons: the piezoelectric elements within them depolarize, and differential thermal expansion of the different materials within a transducer causes them to fail. In this paper, the design of a high-temperature ultrasonic thickness gauge that bypasses these problems is described. The system uses a waveguide to isolate the vulnerable transducer and piezoelectric elements from the high-temperature measurement zone. Use of thin and long waveguides of rectangular cross section allows large temperature gradients to be sustained over short distances without the need for additional cooling equipment. The main problems that had to be addressed were the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves into and from the testpiece that the waveguides are coupled to, and optimization of the wave propagation along the waveguide itself. It was found that anti-plane shear loading performs best at transmitting and receiving from the surface of a component that is to be inspected. Therefore, a nondispersive guided wave mode in large-aspect-ratio rectangular strips was employed to transmit the anti-plane shear loading from the transducer to the measurement zone. Different joining methods to attach the waveguides to the component were investigated and experiments showed that clamping the waveguides to the component surface gave the best results. The thickness of different plate samples was consistently measured to within less than 0.1 mm. Performance at high temperatures was tested in a furnace at 730\u00b0C for 4 weeks without signal degradation.

Nanowires, oriented along their polar axis, ranging from 0.6 to 2.4 nm in diameter were modeled quantum mechanically. A giant piezoelectric size effect is identified for both GaN and ZnO nanowires. However, GaN exhibits a larger and more extended size dependence than ZnO. The observed size effect is discussed in the context of charge redistribution near the free surfaces leading to changes in local polarization. The study reveals that local changes in polarization and reduction of unit cell volume with respect to bulk values lead to the observed size effect.

It is seen that the phase velocity of SH waves decreases with the increase of the magnitude of the initial compression stress, while it increases with the increase of the magnitude of the initial tensile stress. The initial stress has a great effect on the propagation of SH waves with the decrease of the thickness ratio.

{"title": "Virus disinfection in water by biogenic silver immobilized in polyvinylidene fluoride membranes.", "abstract": "The development of innovative water disinfection strategies is of utmost importance to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases related to poor treatment of (drinking) water. Recently, the association of silver nanoparticles with the bacterial cell surface of Lactobacillus fermentum (referred to as biogenic silver or bio-Ag(0)) has been reported to exhibit antiviral properties. The microscale bacterial carrier matrix serves as a scaffold for Ag(0) particles, preventing aggregation during encapsulation. In this study, bio-Ag(0) was immobilized in different microporous PVDF membranes using two different pre-treatments of bio-Ag(0) and the immersion-precipitation method. Inactivation of UZ1 bacteriophages using these membranes was successfully demonstrated and was most probably related to the slow release of Ag(+) from the membranes. At least a 3.4 log decrease of viruses was achieved by application of a membrane containing 2500 mg bio-Ag(0)(powder) m(-2) in a submerged plate membrane reactor operated at a flux of 3.1 L m(-2) h(-1). Upon startup, the silver concentration in the effluent initially increased to 271 \u03bcg L(-1) but after filtration of 31 L m(-2), the concentration approached the drinking water limit ( = 100 \u03bcg L(-1)).

Most studies of organic materials for spintronics focus on nonpolar dielectrics or semiconductors, serving as passive elements in spin transport devices. Here, we demonstrate that employing organic ferroelectrics, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), as barriers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) allows new functionality in controlling the tunneling spin polarization via the ferroelectric polarization of the barrier. Using first-principles methods based on density functional theory we investigate the spin-resolved conductance of Co/PVDF/Co and Co/PVDF/Fe/Co MTJs as model systems. We show that these tunnel junctions exhibit multiple resistance states associated with different magnetization configurations of the electrodes and ferroelectric polarization orientations of the barrier.

{"title": "Direct immobilisation of antibodies on a bioinspired architecture as a sensing platform.", "abstract": "A sensitive and selective immunosensor for the nonlabeled detection of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is constructed using a self-polymerised polydopamine film as the immobilisation platform. Self-polymerisation of dopamine is used as a powerful approach for applying multifunctional coatings onto the surface of a gold electrode. The polydopamine film is used not only as the immobilisation platform, but also as a cross-linker reagent for the immobilisation of the anti-SRB antibody. The polydopamine film is loaded with a high density of anti-SRB antibodies linked to the substrate to obtain high response signals. The formation and fabrication of the biosensor and the quantification of antibody anchoring are monitored, and SRB detection is performed by either quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After modeling the impedance Nyquist plots of the SRB/anti-SRB/polydopamine/gold electrode for increasing concentrations of SRB, the electron transfer resistance (R(ct)) is used as a measure of immunocomplex binding. The R(ct) is correlated with the concentration of bacterial cells in the range of 1.8\u00d710(2) to 1.8\u00d710(6) CFU mL(-1); the detection limit is 50 CFU mL(-1).

{"title": "Progress in developing a thermal method for measuring the output power of medical ultrasound transducers that exploits the pyroelectric effect.", "abstract": "Progress in developing a new measurement method for ultrasound output power is described. It is a thermal-based technique with the acoustic power generated by a transducer being absorbed within a specially developed polyurethane rubber material, whose high absorption coefficient ensures energy deposition within a few mm of the ultrasonic wave entering the material. The rate of change of temperature at the absorber surface is monitored using the pyroelectric voltage generated from electrodes disposed either side of a 60 mm diameter, 0.061 mm thick membrane of the piezoelectric polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) bonded to the absorber. The change in the pyroelectric output voltage generated by the sensor when the transducer is switched ON and OFF is proportional to the delivered ultrasound power. The sensitivity of the device is defined as the magnitude of these switch voltages to a unit input stimulus of power (watt). Three important aspects of the performance of the pyroelectric sensor have been studied. Firstly, measurements have revealed that the temperature dependent sensitivity increases over the range from approximately 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C at a rate of +1.6% \u00b0C(-1). Studies point to the key role that the properties of both the absorbing backing layer and pvdf membrane play in controlling the sensor response. Secondly, the high sensitivity of the technique has been demonstrated using an NPL Pulsed Checksource, a 3.5 MHz focused transducer delivering a nominal acoustic power level of 4 mW. Finally, proof-of-concept of a new type of acoustic sensor responding to time-averaged intensity has been demonstrated, through fabrication of an absorber-backed hydrophone of nominal active element diameter 0.4 mm. A preliminary study using such a device to resolve the spatial distribution of acoustic intensity within plane-piston and focused 3.5 MHz acoustic fields has been completed.

However, here, we observe from the electrical response that significant motional anharmonicity is introduced in the presence of attached analyte. Experiments were conducted with streptavidin-coated polystyrene microbeads of various sizes attached to a quartz crystal resonator via specific and nonspecific molecular tethers in liquid. Quantitative analysis reveals that the deviation of odd Fourier harmonics of the response caused by introduction of microbeads as a function of oscillation amplitude presents a unique signature of the molecular tether. Hence, the described anharmonic detection technique (ADT) based on this function allows screening of biomolecules and provides an additional level of selectivity in receptor-based detection that is often associated with nonspecific interactions. We also propose methods to extract mechanical force-extension characteristics of the molecular tether and activation energy using this technique.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2010-12-17", "authors": ["Sourav KGhosh", "Victor POstanin", "Ashwin ASeshia"], "doi": "10.1021/ac102261q"}

Dentinal fluid was collected during a period of 2 minutes from dentin cavities by using folded polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, which were then transferred to microcentrifugation tubes containing physiologic saline solution. Total MMP-9 levels in these solutions were assessed by using a human MMP-9 fluorescent assay, detection limit 0.25 ng/mL. MMP-9 levels between groups were compared by using Mann-Whitney U test (alpha <0.05).\nThree specimens from the symptomatic teeth were not included because coronal pulps proved to be necrotic on access. Dentinal fluid samples from symptomatic teeth had significantly higher MMP-9 levels than those from clinically healthy counterparts (P < .05). However, merely 7 of the 16 pulpitis samples contained detectable levels of MMP-9. None of the clinically healthy control specimens contained any detectable amounts of MMP-9.\nWith a sensitive assay, it was possible to detect an enzyme linked with pulp tissue destruction (MMP-9) in dentinal fluid.

The blotted spots were stained by anti-ginsenoside-Rb1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) and anti-ginsenoside-Rg1MAb, respectively. The newly established immunostaining method, eastern blotting was applied for the determination of ginsenosides possessing protopanaxadiol and/or protopanaxatriol. Double staining of eastern blotting for ginsenosides using anti-ginsenoside-Rb1 MAb and anti-ginsenoside-Rg1 MAb promoted complete identification of ginsenosides in Panax species. This technique has been devised for the chromatographic separation and identification of ginsenosides using polyethersulfone (PES) membrane. It caused an acceptable separation of ginsenoside-Rb1, -Rc and -Rd in various ginseng extracts. Newly developed technique is quite simple and applies for immunoassay system. Ginsenosides separated using a PES membrane were directly treated with a NaIO(4) solution and then reacted with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for making a ginsenoside-protein conjugate.

Herein, we investigated the role of filler aspect ratio in nanocomposites for energy storage. Nanocomposites were synthesized using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with two different aspect ratio (nanowires, nanorods) fillers at various volume fractions dispersed in a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix. The permittivity constants of composites containing nanowires (NWs) were higher than those with nanorods (NRs) at the same inclusion volume fraction. It was also indicated that the high frequency loss tangent of samples with PZT nanowires was smaller than for those with nanorods, demonstrating the high electrical energy storage efficiency of the PZT NW nanocomposite. The high aspect ratio PZT NWs showed a 77.8% increase in energy density over the lower aspect ratio PZT NRs, under an electric field of 15 kV mm(-1) and 50% volume fraction. The breakdown strength was found to decrease with the increasing volume fraction of PZT NWs, but to only change slightly from a volume fraction of around 20%-50%. The maximum calculated energy density of nanocomposites is as high as 1.158 J cm(-3) at 50% PZT NWs in PVDF. Since the breakdown strength is lower compared to a PVDF copolymer such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-tertrifluoroethylene-terchlorotrifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TreEE-CTFE) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) P(VDF-HFP), the energy density of the nanocomposite could be significantly increased through the use of PZT NWs and a polymer with greater breakdown strength.

Model stones were sonicated for 5 minutes at peak negative pressures (p-) of 10, 15, 19, 22, and 24-MPa.

The histotripsy erosion rate increased with increasing peak negative pressure from 10 to 19 MPa and then saturated, yielding an average rate of 87.9 \u00b1 12.8 mg/min at maximum treatment intensity. Piezoelectric lithotripsy achieved an average treatment rate of 110.7 \u00b1 27.4 mg/min.\nHistotripsy comminution of urinary calculi is a surface erosion phenomenon that is mechanistically distinct from conventional shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), producing only fine debris as opposed to coarse fragments.

Incorporation of IgG within the PAH/PSS multilayer did not give rise to overcharging and did not affect the linear build up. ELISpot test on PAH/PSS multilayer modified polystyrene wells showed that the cytokine response was significantly smaller than on the regular PVDF backed polystyrene wells.

{"title": "Mesh fixation in laparoscopic incisional hernia repair: glue fixation provides attachment strength similar to absorbable tacks but differs substantially in different meshes.", "abstract": "Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has gained popularity among minimally invasive surgeons. However, mesh fixation remains a matter of discussion. This study was designed to compare noninvasive fibrin-glue attachment with tack fixation of meshes developed primarily for intra-abdominal use. It was hypothesized that particular mesh structures would substantially influence detachment force.\nFor initial evaluation, specimens of laminated polypropylene/polydioxanone meshes were anchored to porcine abdominal walls by either helical titanium tacks or absorbable tacks in vitro. A universal tensile-testing machine was used to measure tangential detachment forces (TF). For subsequent experiments of glue fixation, polypropylene/polydioxanone mesh and 4 additional meshes with diverse particular mesh structure, ie, polyvinylidene fluoride/polypropylene mesh, a titanium-coated polypropylene mesh, a polyester mesh bonded with a resorbable collagen, and a macroporous condensed PTFE mesh were evaluated.\nTF tests revealed that fibrin-glue attachment was not substantially different from that achieved with absorbable tacks (median TF 7.8 Newton [N], range 1.3 to 15.8 N), but only when certain open porous meshes (polyvinylidene fluoride/polypropylene mesh: median 6.2 N, range 3.4 to 10.3 N; titanium-coated polypropylene mesh: median 5.2 N, range 2.1 to 11.7 N) were used. Meshes coated by an anti-adhesive barrier (polypropylene/polydioxanone mesh: median 3.1 N, range 1.7 to 5.8 N; polyester mesh bonded with a resorbable collagen: median 1.3 N, range 0.5 to 1.9 N), or the condensed PTFE mesh (median 3.1 N, range 2.1 to 7.0 N) provided a significantly lower TF (p < 0.01).\nFibrin glue appears to be an appealing noninvasive option for mesh fixation in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, but only if appropriate meshes are used.

The preliminary obtained results show a good agreement, however numerical approach has the advantage of conceptual simplicity and flexibility brought about by the stiffness matrix method. The propagation behaviour of Love waves in a functionally graded piezoelectric material (FGPM) is investigated in this article. It involves a thin FGPM layer bonded perfectly to an elastic substrate. The inhomogeneous FGPM heterostructure has been stratified along the depth direction, hence each state can be considered as homogeneous and the ordinary differential equation method is applied. The obtained solutions are used to study the effect of an exponential gradient applied to physical properties. Such numerical approach allows applying different gradient variation for mechanical and electrical properties. For this case, the obtained results reveal opposite effects. The dispersive curves and phase velocities of the Love wave propagation in the layered piezoelectric film are obtained for electrical open and short cases on the free surface, respectively. The effect of gradient coefficients on coupled electromechanical factor, on the stress fields, the electrical potential and the mechanical displacement are discussed, respectively.

One of the proposed mechanisms for its antireflux action is that it reduces lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. We investigated whether fundoplication works through a stretch-sensitive mechanism of LES relaxation.\nStudies were performed in rats. Intravenous and arterial lines were placed and tracheal intubation was performed. A midline laprotomy was performed to place sutures through the esophagus to exert axial stretch on the LES, and the vagus nerve was isolated in the neck for electrical stimulation. The LES pressure was monitored with a 2F solid-state pressure transducer placed through a gastrostomy. Cranial displacement of the LES was recorded using piezoelectric crystals. Data were recorded before and after 360-degree Nissen fundoplication.\nAxial stretch and vagus nerve stimulation induced cranial displacement of the LES as well as LES relaxation in a dose-dependent manner. LES relaxation and axial stretch were each significantly reduced after fundoplication (P < .01). Nitric-oxide-induced LES relaxation was not affected by fundoplication. Removal of fundoplication restored axial stretch- and vagus nerve-stimulated LES relaxation as well as LES cranial displacement.\nFundoplication reduces LES relaxation by interfering with axial stretch on the LES.

Due to the increasing number of neuroscience research projects using genetically engineered mice, the demand for effective recording devices in freely moving mice is also increasing. Although manually and automatically operated microdrive devices are available, they are limited in terms of size, weight, accuracy, manipulability, and convenience for single-unit recording in mice. The present study proposed a novel microdrive that employs a small, lightweight piezo-motor and a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor with a closed-loop position feedback control system. The total weight of the device is 1.82 g, which is perfectly suitable for application to mice. Most importantly, the proposed microdrive is capable of monitoring and adjusting electrode movement on-line by integrating a closed-loop feedback control system, which enhances the accuracy of micro-advancement of the electrode by utilizing position feedback. The performance of this newly developed microdrive was extensively evaluated for both mechanical and physiological concerns at both free-loading and various-loading conditions, including agarose gel matrix and then the hippocampus and thalamus of mice.

A regulated cavitation generator has been developed in an in vitro configuration of standing wave field. This system implements the regulation of the cavitation level during sonication by modulating the applied acoustic intensity with a feedback loop based on acoustic measurements. The experimental setup consists of a plane piezoelectric transducer for sonication (continuous wave, frequency 445 kHz) and a hydrophone pointing to the sonicated medium. The cavitation level is quantified every 5 ms from a spectral analysis of the acoustic signal. The results show that the regulation device generates reproducible mean cavitation levels with a standard deviation lower than 1.6% in the applied intensity range (from 0.12 to 3.44 W/cm(2)), while this standard deviation can reach 76% without regulation.

We hypothesized that \u03b1- and \u03b2-phase PVDF will exert direct but different influences on cell attachment and metabolic activity. PVDF films were fabricated using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) by solvent casting.

The present work focuses on the relative efficiency of a signal combining two neighbouring frequencies and a one-frequency signal for initiating ultrasound inertial cavitation. Experiments were carried out in a water tank, using a 550kHz piezoelectric composite spherical transducer focused on targets with 46\u03bcm roughness. The acoustic signal scattered, either by the target or by the cavitation bubbles, is filtered using a spectral and cepstral-like method to obtain an inertial cavitation activity measurement. The ultrasound excitations consist of 1.8ms single bursts of single frequency f(0)=550kHz excitation, in the monofrequency case, and of dual frequency f(1)=535kHz and f(2)=565kHz excitation, in the bifrequency case. It is shown that depending on the value of the monofrequency cavitation threshold intensity the bifrequency excitation can increase or reduce the cavitation threshold. The analysis of the thresholds indicates that the mechanisms involved are nonlinear. The progress of the cavitation activity beyond the cavitation threshold is also studied. The slope of the cavitation activity considered as a function of the acoustic intensity is always steeper in the case of the bifrequency excitation.

The purpose of this work is to present the theoretical and experimental validation of an ultrasonic methodology for estimating the acoustical properties of paraffin wax on the surface of steel. The method is based on modeling and inversion of the complete electro-acoustic channel from the transmitted voltage over the active piezoelectric element, to the received voltage resulting from the acoustic reverberations in the multilayered structure. In the current work, two conceptually different models of the same multi-layer transducer structure attached to steel is developed and compared with measurements. A method is then suggested for suppressing the strong reverberations in steel, hence isolating the wax signals. This contrast enhancement method is fitted to the model of the structure, facilitating parameter inversion from the wax layer. The results show that the models agree well with measurements and that up to three parameters (travel time, impedance and attenuation) can be inverted from the wax simultaneously.

The survival rate of embryos was greater than 98% using this micromanipulation strategy, which was increased compared to the normal one-cell embryo injection method. More than 90% of injected embryos were GFP positive after subzonal injection of a lentivirus vector carrying the GFP gene with titers of 2 \u00d7 10\u2078 I.U./ml.

The GFP-positive rates were also greater than in the conventional method of injecting one-cell embryos (25.39%). In addition, blastocysts from the two-cell embryo injection group displayed stronger GFP fluorescence than the one-cell embryo injection groups treated with or without the sucrose solution.

These PTFs are useful for e.g. coding and interference based imaging methods, and ultrasound contrast microbubble research. Several optical and acoustic methods to measure a transducer's PTF have been reported in literature. The optical methods require a setup to which not all ultrasound laboratories have access to. The acoustic methods require accurate distance and acoustic wave speed measurements. A small error in these leads to a large error in phase, e.g. an accuracy of 0.1% on an axial distance of 10cm leads to an uncertainty in the PTF measurement of \u00b197\u00b0 at 4MHz. In this paper we present an acoustic pulse-echo method to measure the PTF of a transducer, which is based on linear wave propagation and only requires an estimate of the wave travel distance and the acoustic wave speed. In our method the transducer is excited by a monofrequency sine burst with a rectangular envelope. The transducer initially vibrates at resonance (transient regime) prior to the forcing frequency response (steady state regime). The PTF value of the system is the difference between the phases deduced from the transient and the steady state regimes. Good agreement, to within 7\u00b0, was obtained between KLM simulations and measurements on two transducers in a 1-8MHz frequency range. The reproducibility of the method was \u00b110\u00b0, with a systematic error of 2\u00b0 at 1MHz increasing to 16\u00b0 at 8MHz.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyanoacrylates glue for polypropylene-polyvinylidene fluoride (PP-PVDF) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) fixation in a rabbit model.\nIn 40 New Zealand white rabbits, three pieces (3\u00d73cm) of a PP-PVDF mesh (n=120) were fixed in IPOM technique on both sides of a midline laparotomy. For mesh fixation we used spiral tacks, nonabsorbable sutures, or cyanoacrylate glue in a randomized manner. All animals were killed after 12 wk. The prosthetic materials were excised en bloc with the anterior abdominal wall for evaluation of the tensile strength and histologic analysis. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation.\nMeshes fixed with glue showed a significantly higher tenacity of adhesions (2.75\u00b10.97) compared with those with tacks (2.44\u00b10.97 sutures versus 1.91\u00b10.92 tacks). The percentage of adhesions in the glue group was comparable to the suture group (36.50% \u00b1 27.60% glue, 37.62% \u00b1 27.36% suture). The tensile strength of stapled and sutured meshes was significantly higher than the tensile strength glued mesh (14.15\u00b10.97N suture versus 14.84\u00b10.74 stapler versus 9.64\u00b10.78N glue). Mesh shrinkage was irrespective of the fixation technique. The inflammation reaction was more pronounced in the glue group.\nAlthough cyanoacrylate glue showed a considerable cellular ingrowth in this rabbit model, sutures and tacks proved to be superior for IPOM fixation of PP-PVDF meshes in terms of tensile strength.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2010-03-02", "authors": ["RolandLadurner", "IngaDrosse", "DominikB\u00fcrklein", "WolfgangPlitz", "GregorBarbaryka", "ChlodwigKirchhoff", "SonjaKirchhoff", "WolfMutschler", "MatthiasSchieker", "ThomasMussack"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2009.11.710"}
{"title": "Evaluation of different methods of indirect sinus floor elevation for elevation heights of 10mm: an experimental ex vivo study.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to macroscopically and microscopically evaluate different methods of indirect sinus floor elevation regarding elevation heights of 10 mm.\nFour different methods of indirect sinus floor elevation-osteotome sinus floor elevation (OSFE), bone added osteotome sinus floor elevation (BAOSFE), piezo- surgical sinus floor elevation (PSFE), and sinus floor elevation with an inflatable balloon, balloon-lift-control system (BLC) - were macroscopically and microscopically investigated ex vivo using 36 bisected pigs' heads.\nOSFE and BAOSFE perforated the Schneiderian membrane, whereas the inflatable balloon caused no laceration. PSFE elevated the mucosa without laceration as well, but was technically restricted to an elevation height of 5 mm. BAOSFE, PSFE, and BLC separated the mucosa, leaving the periosteum on the bone. OSFE completely lifted the soft tissue from the bone, including the periosteum.\nThe results of this study indicate that balloon elevation of the sinus floor may extend the indication for indirect sinus floor elevation for elevation heights of up to 10 mm. The histological elevation layer seems to be non-uniform in the different sinus floor elevation methods. Further in vivo experiments have to prove these findings as well as their relevance regarding the clinical outcome of sinus floor augmentation.", "journal": "Clinical implant dentistry and related research", "date": "2009-08-18", "authors": ["FlorianStelzle", "Klaus-UlrichBenner"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1708-8208.2009.00190.x"}
