{"title": "Endophytic Colonization of Plants by the Biocontrol Agent Rhizobium etli G12 in Relation to Meloidogyne incognita Infection.", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The external and internal colonization of potato and Arabidopsis roots by the biocontrol strain Rhizobium etli G12 containing a plasmidborne trp promoter green fluorescent protein transcriptional fusion, pGT-trp, was studied in the presence and absence of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Plant colonization behavior and biocontrol potential of the marked strain G12(pGT-trp) was not altered compared with the parental strain. Plasmid pGT-trp was stable for more than 80 generations without selection and conferred sufficient fluorescence to detect single bacterial cells in planta. Although bacteria were found over the entire rhizoplane, they preferentially colonized root tips, the emerging lateral roots, and galled tissue caused by Meloidogyne infestation. Internal colonization of potato roots was mainly observed in epidermal cells, especially root hairs. G12(pGT-trp) colonization was also observed in inner Arabidopsis root tissues in areas of vascularization. In the presence of M. incognita, G12(pGT-trp) colonized the interior of nematode galls in high numbers. In some cases, bacterial colonization even extended from the galled tissue into adjacent root tissue. The internally colonized sites in roots were often discontinuous. Fluorescence microscopy of gfp-tagged rhizobacteria was a sensitive and a rapid technique to study external and internal colonization of plant roots by bacteria interacting with nematodes.", "journal": "Phytopathology", "date": "2008-10-24", "authors": ["JHallmann", "AQuadt-Hallmann", "W GMiller", "R ASikora", "S ELindow"], "doi": "10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.4.415"}
{"title": "The morphology and selected biological properties of articular cartilage.", "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to present the current state of knowledge regarding the structure and functions of articular cartilage. Articular cartilage is constructed with hyaline cartilage tissue. It is composed of chondrocytes located in lacunae and the extracellular matrix. The chondrial matrix contains water, collagen, proteglycans, non-collagenous matrix proteins, and lipids. Articular cartilage is devided into four zones - superficial, intermediate, deep, and calcified - on the basic of morphology, the orientation of collagen fiber, and the proteoglycan content. The dominant collagen of this tissue is Type II collagen, which, together with smaller quantities of other collagens (i.e. Types IX and XII), forms a network of fibers, with large, aggregating proteoglycans and smaller, non-aggregating proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are proteins that contain covalently attached glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), with water between them. The large aggregating proteoglycans, called \"aggrecans\", form aggregates that bind hyaluronic acid, and together with collagen they are responsible for the mechanical properties of cartilage. The smallnonaggregating proteoglycans, decorin and fibromodulin, limit the formation of collagen fibres. Other proteins in the cartilage matrix - chondrocalcin and the N-propetide of Type II collagen - participate in fiber formation. Yet other proteins - chondronectin, fibronectin, vitronectin and thrombospondin - take part in the interaction between the chondrocytes and the matrix. Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) prevents the vascularization of the cartilage and, perhaps, is responsible for the repair process. The proteins known as Cart-1 and CEP-68 participate in chondrogenesis, while tenascin and Mgp are considered to be cartilage calcification inhibitors. Apart from the structural elements, chondrocytes produce substances that fulfill purely physiological functions: enzymes and cytokines. The enzymes - which include metalloproteinases, adamalysins, serine and cysteine proteases and their inhibitors - participate in cartilage matrix reconstruction. The cytokines - IL-1, TNF-alfa, IL-6, IL-8, and LIF - stimulate the chondrocytes to produce an increased amount of enzymes, while IL-4 inhibits this process. Human articular chondrocytes exibit the constitutive expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), molecules regulating the activation of the complement, and after activation (e.g. under the influence of IFN-alfa, IL-1, TNF-a or in the course of arthritis), also MHC class II and ICAM-1 intracellular adhesion molecules. Numerous studies have shown that chondrocytes also have tissue-specific antigens, which induce the production of antibodies in patients with cartilage grafts, as well as those with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Some of these antibodies react with type II collagen, others are directed against other proteins i.e. anchorin CII and CH65. the role of these diverse molecules, which are present in cartilage cells and separated from the immune system by the matrix, remains unclear.", "journal": "Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja", "date": "2007-11-08", "authors": ["AHyc", "AOsiecka-Iwan", "JJ\u00f3\u017awiak", "SMoskalewski"], "doi": null}

This precludes safe delivery of potentially curative high-dose fractionated proton radiotherapy. To avoid this problem, the authors performed pedicled rhinotomy to resect chordomas in 10 patients.\nPedicled rhinotomy is a midface transnasal route to the intercarotid sella and clivus from the tuberculum sellae to the mid-C-2 level. It involves a lateral rhinotomy incision, osteotomies of nasal bones and cartilage, lateral rotation of the nose, removal of the nasal septum and medial maxillary walls, opening of ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and dissection of nasopharynx and oropharynx to expose the clivus and craniovertebral junction. Tumors involving the sella, medial cavernous sinuses, middle and lower clivus, and C-1 arch and dens can be removed even if they traverse the dura. Closure involves dural repair, grafting of fat and split-thickness skin, rotation of a vascularized mucosal pedicle, and reattachment of nasal cartilage. Ten clival chordomas in adult patients were surgically removed via a pedicled rhinotomy approach. Seven patients had previously undergone a total of nine skull base procedures. In eight of the 10 patients, tumors compressing the brainstem were completely removed using this technique. One patient required an additional subtemporal resection of a suprasellar tumor before definitive radiotherapy could be undertaken. No patient sustained any new neurological deficit; in eight patients headache, diplopia, or hemiparesis improved. One patient developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis that were successfully treated with antibiotic agents and shunt placement.\nPedicled rhinotomy provides excellent shallow-field exposure of midline clival chordomas and permits relief of brainstem compression and the postoperative administration of potentially curative proton beam irradiation.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2006-06-01", "authors": ["GHarsh", "ROjemann", "MVarvares", "BSwearingen", "MCheney", "MJoseph"], "doi": "10.3171/foc.2001.10.3.9"}

{"title": "Calcitonin effects on cartilage and fracture healing.", "abstract": "The literature about the effects of systemically administered calcitonin on fracture healing and in the prevention of disuse osteoporosis after fracture are reviewed in this study. Fracture healing is a biological process of great importance for the survival of the injured animal. Endochondral ossification is augmented in the fracture site followed by fast remodeling of the produced woven bone. There is strong evidence of the direct effects of calcitonin on cartilage proliferation as well as the vascularization of the callus. Calcitonin is found to promote the cartilaginous phase of fracture healing. On the other hand, the innervation of callus reveals an extensive distribution of sensory fibers containing a calcitonin gene-related peptide, a neuropeptide with potent vasodilatory actions. From several experimental studies, salmon calcitonin administration has been found to have a beneficial effect on fracture healing. Studies in humans also concur that calcitonin may speed up the time of fracture repair and facilitate early mobilization of the injured limb. Finally, calcitonin prevents post-fracture bone loss due to increased post-injury remodeling and lowers hydroxyproline and calcium excretion of patients who underwent internal fixation of fracture on the hip.", "journal": "Journal of musculoskeletal & neuronal interactions", "date": "2005-03-11", "authors": ["GLyritis", "P JBoscainos"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Does a pro-angiogenic state exist in the bone-implant interface of aseptically loosened joint prosthesis?", "abstract": "Neovascularization is indispensable to both bone remodeling and the development of chronic inflammation. A pro-angiogenic state in the periprosthetic tissue may augment the inflammatory response to wear debris. To investigate if a pro-angiogenic state exists in the bone-implant interface of aseptically loosened joint prosthesis, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor Flk-1/KDR were studied by immunohistochemistry. The VEGF-Flk/KDR pathway has been implicated as a key signaling requirement for pathological angiogenesis. The level of vascularization in periprosthetic tissue was semi-quantitatively compared to osteoarthritic (OA) and rheumatoid arthritic (RA) synovium. The level of vascularization in areas of periprosthetic tissue with heavy or low/moderate wear debris were also compared semi-quantitatively by image analysis. High levels of VEGF expression (16/16 cases) particularly in the implant synovial-like lining layer together with Flk-1/KDR expression by endothelial cells (13/16), suggests that neovascularization is occurring. Morphometric comparison of periprosthetic tissue with RA and OA synovium revealed no significant difference in microvessel density, but did reveal significantly increased microvessel area in RA synovium (P > 0.05). Areas of high wear debris infiltrate also contained a significantly smaller microvessel area (P > 0.01). Suggesting that wear debris may cause behavioral modification of microvessels.

{"title": "Further evaluation of amniotic membrane banking for transplantation in ocular surface diseases.", "abstract": "Objective: To define the best conditions for amniotic membrane preparation, storage and banking in its use for corneal reconstruction. Methods: Amniotic membrane pieces were prepared under sterile conditions from placentas selected on the basis of donor medical and social history, serology, microbiological tests and histology. The pieces were kept at -140 degrees C but before grafting they were thawed and stored at 4 degrees C in RPMI medium, to have a preparation usable within 72 h. This procedure was validated by testing its therapeutic effectiveness in 25 patients 13 of which had corneal ulcers of various origin, 3 had sequelae of herpes simplex keratitis, 3 band keratopathy and 6 corneal stem cell deficiency due to chemical or thermal burns. Results: The preparation showed appreciable anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. In the absence of corneal stem cell deficiency a stable re-epithelialisation was achieved in 15 out of 19 patients. When the limbus was lesioned, the amniotic membrane decreased vascularization and increased the number of corneal epithelial cells only in 1 of the 6 patients. No adverse reactions attributable to the tissue were recorded. Conclusions: A ready-to-use amniotic membrane preparation stored at 4 degrees C after cryopreservation has been tested in corneal reconstruction. Like the amniotic membrane thawed immediately before grafting, this preparation displayed full therapeutic effect in epithelial defects with stromal ulceration but without severe limbal stem cell deficiency.

The ileo pouch anal anastomosis however, has a 15-35% pouch-related complication rate, 10% failure rate and is accompanied by an unpredictable functional outcome. In order to reduce these unfavourable rates and to improve functional results an alternative surgical technique, the ileo neorectal anastomosis (INRA), was developed experimentally.\nIn an experimental study 12 Yorkshire-Dutch landpigs had a subtotal colectomy and rectal mucosectomy. Subsequently a vascularized ileal mucosa sling was created and transposed on to the denuded rectal muscular cuff in eight. In another four animals a non-vascularized mucosa sling was transposed. The covering ileostomy was closed after 3 weeks. Repeated endoscopies, histological examinations of mucosal biopsies and rectal compliance measurements were carried out to evaluate the functional result of the neorectum.\nThe surgical procedure of the INRA was technically successful in this animal study. Repeated endoscopy and histology showed complete ileal mucosa ingrowth in the neorectum without severe fibrosis in the group of animals with a vascularized sling. At follow up after 1 year no colonic metaplasia had occurred. Measurements of the neorectal reservoirs in the group of animals with a vascularized INRA procedure showed a median 'maximum tolerated volume' of 338 ml (range 300-410 ml).\nThe INRA is technically feasible and reproducible. The histologically proven survival of the vascularized ileal mucosa and development of a compliant neorectal reservoir make the INRA an interesting alternative restorative procedure.

In rats and other species, activated monocytes/macrophages aggravate autoimmune reactions, rejection of non-vascularized allografts and chronic allograft rejection. It is very likely that they also contribute to acute allograft destruction. So far it has been impossible to distinguish the function of monocytes from that of macrophages, because cell phenotypes and their alterations upon activation are ill-defined. We have thus begun to characterize the ex vivo phenotype and function of rat monocytes in the normal state and during renal allograft rejection. Monocytes are recovered from both the central and the marginal blood pool by perfusing either the recipient's circulation or the allograft vasculature. Rat monocytes have a unique surface phenotype. During allograft rejection or after infusion of interferon-gamma they up-regulate class II MHC molecules, CD161 (NKR-P1A), CD62L and CD8, while CD4 and CD43 are down-modulated.

It also summarizes the results of extensive studies of endogenous lectins, their structure, carbohydrate specificity and biological functions with the major emphasis on the significance of lectin-cell surface carbohydrate interactions in a metastatic process. Numerous data demonstrate that malignant transformation is associated with various and complex alterations in the glycosylation process. Some of these changes might provide a selective advantage for tumor cells during their progression to more invasive and metastatic phenotype. Cell glycosylation depends on the expression and function of various glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. Recently, transfection of genes encoding various glysosyltransferases gene in sense and antisense orientation helped to bring direct evidence that changes in cell surface carbohydrates are important for the metastatic behavior of tumor cells. Cell surface carbohydrates affect tumor cell interactions with normal cells or with the extracellular matrix during metastatic spread and growth. These interactions can be mediated via tumor cell carbohydrates and their binding proteins known as endogenous lectins. The family of the discovered endogenous lectins is rapidly expanding. The number of C-type lectins has reached 50 and at least 10 galectins have been identified. The biological significance of the endogenous lectins and their possible role in tumor growth and metastasis formation has started to unravel. Some lectins recognize the 'foreign' patterns of cell surface carbohydrates expressed by microorganisms and tumor cells, and play a role in innate and adaptive immunity. It was shown that lectins affect tumor cell survival, adhesion to the endothelium or extracellular matrix, as well as tumor vascularization and other processes that are crucial for metastatic spread and growth.", "journal": "Cancer metastasis reviews", "date": "2002-06-28", "authors": ["EGorelik", "UGalili", "ARaz"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1015535427597"}

Heparanase, degrading heparan sulfate (HS) at specific intrachain sites, is synthesized as a latent approximately 65 kDa protein that is processed at the N-terminus into a highly active approximately 50 kDa form. The heparanase enzyme is preferentially expressed in human tumors and its overexpression in low-metastatic tumor cells confers a highly invasive phenotype in experimental animals. Heparanase also releases angiogenic factors and accessory fragments of HS from the tumor microenvironment and induces an angiogenic response in vivo. These effects were best demonstrated when the enzyme was secreted and/or expressed on the cell surface. Heparanase may thus facilitate tumor cell invasion, vascularization and survival, all critical events in cancer progression.

We report on our experience in imaging these microcirculation pattern in vivo using simultaneous confocal Fluorescein (FA)- and Indocyaninegreen (ICG) angiography before and after brachytherapy.\nThe simultaneously procured confocal FA- and ICG angiograms of 50 patients with untreated choroidal melanomas were studied for the visibility of microcirculation pattern. Patients were also followed with simultaneous FA/ICG after brachytherapy.\nConfocal FA disclosed signs of tumor vascularization in 12 (24%) of the 50 examined patients but microcirculation pattern only in 3 patients (6%). In contrast, simultaneously obtained confocal ICG disclosed microcirculation pattern in 47 patients (94%). In 10 (77%) of the 13 patients the tumor microcirculation changed considerably after brachytherapy: Distortion, thickening, thinning, as well as complete obliteration of vessels could be observed.\nHistologically demonstrated microcirculation pattern can be imaged in vivo. This offers the possibility to assess the likely biologic behavior of the individual tumor without the need for obtaining a cytologic or histologic specimen via enucleation or fine-needle biopsy. Confocal ICG angiogiography images microcirculation pattern better than FA which can be explained by the different absorption-, fluorescence- and exudation-characteristics ICG. Follow-up with confocal ICG of choroidal melanomas after brachytherapy shows different features and allows for visualization of the microcirculation reaction to the treatment which might be a useful tool for studying the effects of future anti-angiogenesis based tumor therapies.", "journal": "International ophthalmology", "date": "2002-04-12", "authors": ["A JMueller", "D UBartsch", "USchaller", "W RFreeman", "AKampik"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1014471118208"}

The present study gives a historical survey over the research on the cardiac vascularization before 1700 and presents these three authors and their works on the Thebesian vessels with a biographical introduction and a commented translation. As for the biography of the Silesian anatomist Thebesius large, mostly inedited materials from Polish archives and from family archives were studied, among them, poems, a handwritten biography and a pedigree of the family. A schedule tables the studies and articles on the Thebesian vessels and the Thebesian valve published since 1708. As a commentary to the bibliography, the present stage of knowledge on the Thebesian vessels is shortly summarized. Although a compensatory function of the Thebesian vessels in coronary sclerosis and other pathological conditions has been discussed repeatedly, methodical difficulties still do not allow a reliable judgement on the role of the Thebesian vessels in physiological and pathological conditions. This study shows the contradictory results and summarizes all statements which have been published on the embryology, comparative anatomy, macroscopical and (electron-)microscopical anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and cardio-surgery.

In this paper, the vascular anatomy of the distal radius is demonstrated and the surgical technique of VBG harvest is described. Our indications and results for treatment of scaphoid nonunion and Kienb\u00f6ck's disease are discussed and compared with the current literature. Fifteen patients with scaphoid nonunion and nine patients with Kienb\u00f6ck's disease stage IIIa were treated by reverse-flow pedicled VBG. Range of motion and grip strength were measured postoperatively and compared to the contralateral hand in all patients. An outcome questionnaire was used to measure patient's satisfaction and ADL's in the patients with Kienb\u00f6ck's disease. The radiologic diagnostic was performed with conventional X-rays, trispiral tomograms and MRI. In the scaphoid nonunion group, all patients were male, with an average age of 27.6 years. Five patients had prior attempts of autogenous bone grafting which failed. Six patients had a radiographic suggestion of proximal fragment avascular necrosis. All scaphoids healed. Time to union was 11.1 weeks on average. Average follow-up was 36.2 months. Pain relief, range of motion and grip strength were very promising. The treatment of Kienb\u00f6ck's disease was also promising in nine patients. Mean patient age was 31 years, and follow-up averaged 32 months. Six patients had complete pain relief, and three had occasional pain. Grip strength reached 86% of the contralateral side (a 25% improvement from preoperative values).

{"title": "[Molecular and cell aspects of the cancer metastasis].", "abstract": "The metastasis dissemination is a process which leads to a primary tumor cells to migrate, infiltrate host tissues and form a secondary tumor focus at distance. This clinic evolution is a consequence of the cancer natural history and is due to the appearance of new potentialities in tumoral cells, providing to a small quantity of them an invasive and metastatic capability. This dissemination is possible by many factors; among them the lack of cohesion in tumor tissue cells, forming new blood vessels, resistance to anoikis and posterior implantation of tumoral cells in a heterotypic site. The change of cohesion in cell systems, synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, cell motility, modification of signals induced by growth factors, or the substratum for environment adhesion, and lack immune recognition by the immunologic system, are the main contributors to the appearance of metastasis. A permissive ecosystem is necessary to implant tumoral cells in target organs such as: liver, lung and bone marrow. This special environment, which is more favorable to metastasis, supplies an stroma, adhesive systems, growth factors and neo-vascularization. It is important to point out that the development of a metastasis is preceded by some genetic changes which make possible the adaptation of malign cells to a new microenvironment.", "journal": "Acta cientifica venezolana", "date": "2002-03-28", "authors": ["FArvelo", "M FPoupon"], "doi": null}

Tumour cells entrapped in alginate beads were injected subcutaneously into mice. The quantification of alginate implant vascularization was performed with 125I-labeled mouse albumin injected intravenously. In mice bearing transplantable Lewis lung cancer the additive antiangiogenic, but not cytostatic, effect of genistein combined with cyclophosphamide (CY) was observed, since the treatment with genistein alone reduced tumour blood supply in 35% (tumour weight in 36%), with CY in 38% (tumour weight in 70%) and with both compounds in 61% (tumour weight in 75%). In the B16 melanoma model the respective values were: 60 and 44% for genistein, 83 and 79% for CY and 76 and 74% for combined treatment.

An abundance of data on tumor angiogenesis is available and it clearly shows that most human solid tumors are heterogeneously vascularized and oxygenated and contain hypoxic regions. Such regions and areas of reduced vascularization can affect the response to a variety of drugs. Direct measurements of angiogenesis in various types of tumors have, upon correlation of the data with therapeutic outcome, shown that a high vascular density is associated with a decreased response to therapy and short overall survival time.

In both experiments the eyes were examined for 20 days for evidence of corneal irritation and tolerance. At the end of each experiment, histopathologic studies were performed on all corneas.\nThe corneal reaction to the intrastromally injected cyanoacrylate was characterized clinically by slight edema and vascularization localized to the vicinity of the adhesive. A moderate foreign body-type reaction was found histologically. Following application of the adhesive to a central stromal defect, the treated corneas remained totally clear and histopathologic examination showed that the healing process was not altered compared to the controls. The mean retention time of the glue patch was 14 days.\nIntrastromal injection and surface application to a corneal defect of n-butyl-ester cyanoacrylate to a corneal defect induced only a mild inflammatory response and did not interfere with the reparative process.

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects. These observations suggest an etiologic link between hippocampal VFC and hippocampal sclerosis.", "journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "date": "2002-03-21", "authors": ["JWegiel", "IKuchna", "TWisniewski", "M Jde Leon", "BReisberg", "TPirttila", "TKivimaki", "TLehtimaki"], "doi": "10.1007/s00401-001-0471-y"}

The left LD muscle was exposed in order to preserve the proximal tendon with its thoracodorsal nerve and artery. The animal was kept in lateral decubitus over a heating board attached to the mechanical stage of the intravital microscope.

{"title": "Limbal stem cells in health and disease.", "abstract": "Stem cells are present in all self-reviewing tissues and have unique properties. The ocular surface is made up of two distinct types of epithelial cells, constituting the conjunctival and the corneal epithelia. These epithelia are stratified, squamous and non-keratinized. Although anatomically continuous with each other at the corneoscleral limbus, the two cell phenotypes represent quite distinct subpopulations. The stem cells for the cornea are located at the limbus. The microenvironment of the limbus is considered to be important in maintaining stemness of the stem cells. They also act as a \"barrier\" to conjunctival epithelial cells and prevent them from migrating on to the corneal surface. In certain pathologic conditions, however, the limbal stem cells may be destroyed partially or completely resulting in varying degrees of stem cell deficiency with its characteristic clinical features. These include \"conjunctivalization\" of the cornea with vascularization, appearance of goblet cells, and an irregular and unstable epithelium. The stem cell deficiency can be managed with auto or allotransplantation of these cells. With the latter option, systemic immunosuppression is required.

We reviewed our most recent experience with BPFs and tried to determine methods which may effectively reduce its occurrence.\nData on 490 patients with lung resections for NSCLC over a period from 1990 to 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Details regarding surgery and the subsequent treatment were carefully reviewed. Particular attention was paid to factors possibly affecting the occurrence of BPFs: the technique of the initial bronchial closure, previous radiation and/or chemotherapy, need for postoperative ventilation and presence of residual carcinomatous tissue at the bronchial suture line. Information about age, sex, clinical diagnosis, associated conditions, TNM stage, period between primary operation and rethoracotomy and postoperative outcome was also recorded.\nThe overall BPF incidence was 4.4% (22/490). There were 21 (95.5%) males and 1 (4.5%) female, mean age was 57.8 years. BPFs occurred after pneumonectomy in 12 (54.6%), after lobectomy in 9 (40.9%) patients and after sleeve resections in 1 (4.5%) patient. Mortality rate was 27.2% (6/22). Right-sided pneumonectomy and postoperative mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for BPFs (p<0.05). Initial chest re-exploration was performed in 20 (90.9%) patients. After debridement, the bronchial stump was reclosed by hand suture in 10 (45.4%) patients. All 10 (45.4%) patients with a post-lobectomy- and sleeve resection BPF necessitated completion surgery. The BPF was additionally covered with a vascularized flap in 20 (90.9%) patients. In 2 (9%) patients with small BPFs and poor overall condition the initial treatment was endoscopic. In both the fistula persisted and the stump had to be surgically resutured.\nA BPF remains a major complication in the surgery of NSCLC because of its high mortality and morbidity rate. A BPF is more common after right-sided pneumonectomy and is frequently associated with postoperative mechanical ventilation. The management varies according to the initial type of surgery, the size of the BPF, the overall patient condition and that of the remaining lung.

We modified a daily infusion and inflammation model and evaluated it for fibrotic and angiogenic features.

Over a period of 4 weeks, the animals received a daily infusion of Dianeal 4.25% (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) with an initial three doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or physiologic saline. Peritoneal fluid was assayed for transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Animals were humanely killed at week 5. Net ultrafiltration was then measured, and tissue samples were immunostained for factor VIII. Mesenteric tissue was assayed for hydroxyproline content. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of beta-galactosidase was assayed by intraperitoneal administration of the virus, 4 days before the end of the experiment.\nAnimals treated with either Dianeal or physiologic saline showed peritoneal membrane thickening and increased vascularity. Fibrosis was demonstrated by increased hydroxyproline concentration. Ultrafiltration was impaired. We found increased concentrations of VEGF and TGFbeta in the peritoneal fluid of animals treated with LPS and daily infusion. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the peritoneal membrane was demonstrated in the model.\nExposure to LPS and daily Dianeal or physiologic saline leads to peritoneal fibrosis and neoangiogenesis.

{"title": "Keratinocyte-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor accelerates wound healing: Stimulation of keratinocyte proliferation, granulation tissue formation, and vascularization.", "abstract": "Chronic, nonhealing wounds represent a major clinical challenge to practically all disciplines in modern medicine including dermatology, oncology, surgery, and hematology. In skin wounds, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is secreted by keratinocytes shortly after injury and mediates epidermal cell proliferation in an autocrine manner. Many other cells involved in wound healing including macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells synthesize GM-CSF and/or are targets of this cytokine. Therefore, GM-CSF is a pleiotropic cytokine evoking complex processes during wound repair. Despite this complexity and the scarcity of mechanistic understanding GM-CSF has been employed in trials of clinical treatment of skin wounds with some success. In this study, we evaluated a transgenic mouse model in order to analyze the effects of an excess of keratinocyte-derived GM-CSF on excisional wound healing in the skin. Transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing GM-CSF in the basal layer of the epidermis displayed accelerated reepithelialization of full-thickness skin wounds. In the early stages of wound repair, transgenic mice exhibited significantly higher numbers of proliferating keratinocytes at the wound edges and increased formation of granulation tissue with enhanced neovascularization. As a potential mechanism of these beneficial changes, we identified the differential temporal regulation of cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta, a known angiogenetic factor, interferon-gamma, a proinflammatory cytokine, and interleukin 6, an essential factor for reepithelialization, in transgenic mice versus controls. We propose that the beneficial effects observed in GM-CSF transgenics are due not only to direct GM-CSF action but in addition to indirect processes via the induction of secondary cytokines.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2002-03-12", "authors": ["AMann", "KBreuhahn", "PSchirmacher", "MBlessing"], "doi": "10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01600.x"}

The grafts were covered with rotated or slid myocutaneous and conjunctival flaps. The associations of the effect with the blood supply, with the size and the preserved time of the donor tarsal plates, as well as with the follow-up time were analyzed by chi(2) test.\nOf the 43 cases whose plates were fully covered with conjunctival flaps, new blood vessels began growing into the donor tarsal plates one week after the operation. The grafts were vascularized one month later. The donor tarsal plates of 15 cases were only partly covered with conjunctival flaps. As a result, the grafts were vascularized in 2 -- 3 months, and there was dissolution to varying degrees at the surface of the exposed parts of the plates. The effects of the 43 cases with good blood supply were significantly better than the effects of 15 cases with poor blood supply (chi(2) = 5.81, P < 0.05). The sizes of the donor tarsal plates ranged from 5 x 10 mm(2) to 8 x 29 mm(2). Eleven cases were equal or shorter than half of the original sizes of donor tarsal plates, 34 cases were subtotal and 13 cases were total plates. The differences of the sizes led to different results (chi(2) = 6.28, P < 0.05). The preserved times of donor tarsal plates were from 1 week to 2.5 years. However, the results were similar in all cases (chi(2) = 0.99, P > 0.05). All the patients were followed up for 6 months to 10 and half years (mean, 1.8 years). The effects had no statistical significance (chi(2) = 0.85, P > 0.05). The cilia of the donor tarsal plates were preserved in 3 cases, but all of them were totally lost during post-operative one month. After operation slight entropion occurred in 8 cases, slight ectropion in 3 cases, lagophthalmos for 2 -- 3 mm in 7 cases, notch of the palpebral margin in 5 cases and thinness of the donor tarsal plates in 4 cases, but the functional and aesthetic results were normal. Thirty-one cases were cured, 11 cases acquired tangible results and 12 cases were improved. The total effective rate was 93.1%.\nThe more blood supplies of the donor tarsal plates, the better the effects. So we must make all our efforts to improve the blood supplies of the donor tarsal plates. The effects were associated with the sizes of the plates, but not associated with the preserved times of the grafts and the follow-up times. Preserved donor tarsal plate transplantation for the repair of tarsus defect is a relatively simple operation, the rejection is slight and the result satisfactory, thus it is an ideal plastic material.", "journal": "[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology", "date": "2002-02-28", "authors": ["JShi", "YAn", "YMin"], "doi": null}

Here, we present a monoclonal antibody (MAb), which binds to the extracellular portion of the Tie2 receptor and elicits similar agonist effects. Upon MAb binding to the native Tie2 receptor of cultured human umblical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), there is a rapid increase in receptor autophosphorylation with a concomitant enhancement in the recruitment and association of the signalling intermediates Grb2 and SH-PTP2. The antibody further demonstrates functional activity in vascular tissues. In vitro, the antibody promotes the survival of cultured HUVEC and elicits a dose dependent outgrowth and branching of microvessels from cultured explants of rat aorta. When administered in vivo, the antibody enhances the vascularization of subcutaneous Matrigel implants in mice.

During malignant transformation, dysregulation of angiogenesis leads to the formation of a vascular network of tumor-associated capillaries promoting survival and proliferation of the cancerous cells. Activation, migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells into mature blood vessels is driven by several cytokines and growth factors, known to be dysregulated in hematological malignancies. Thus, therapeutic interventions designed to eradicate the malignant clone should incorporate modulation of the angiogenic cascade. Antiangiogenic agents which target different components of the neovascularization process are being investigated in various solid tumors known to have increased vascularity.

{"title": "The efficacy of prevascularization by basic FGF for hepatocyte transplantation using polymer devices in rats.", "abstract": "This study used polymer devices implanted in rats to investigate the effect of prevascularization by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on hepatocyte transplantation (HTx). Lewis rats served as both donors and recipients. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sponges with either hydrogel containing bFGF (bFGF group) or distilled water (control group) were implanted between the mesenteric leaves of recipient rats. Hepatotrophic stimulation was induced by a portacaval shunt and a 70% partial hepatectomy. After 1 week of prevascularization, hepatocytes harvested from the donor Lewis rats using a collagenase digestive method were injected into the sponges. Specimens were harvested at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months after HTx. Histologic examination revealed that the control groups contained small numbers of hepatocytes restricted to the peripheral areas of the sponges. However, a large number of hepatocytes, including clusters, was found distributed uniformly in the bFGF group. In the bFGF group at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months, the percentage of the sponge occupied by hepatocytes was 7.21+/-2.64%, 6.98+/-2.59%, and 5.58+/-3.77%, respectively. The corresponding ratios for the control group were 0.40+/-0.39%, 0.40+/-0.40%, and 0.87+/-1.51%. In addition, the mean number of new blood vessels in the bFGF group was significantly greater than that in the control group at 0 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month after HTx. These results suggest that bFGF strongly induced vascularization, which enabled a large number of hepatocytes to survive in the polymer devices.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2002-01-30", "authors": ["KOgawa", "KAsonuma", "YInomata", "IKim", "YIkada", "YTabata", "KTanaka"], "doi": null}

In our report, two observations of this disorder are presented. Both are interhemispheric in location and are associated with a complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, while having different histological structures. In our first patient, the intracranial formation caused refractory seizures, was partially surgically removed, and a biopsy was performed. Light microscopic examination disclosed the presence of a highly vascularized mature adipose tissue with numerous calcifications. The second case was an incidental finding at autopsy. Microscopically, we found adipose tissue together with numerous foci of hemopoiesis and structures of lamelar bone. In both cases, the indistinct demarcation of the collagenous capsule from the surrounding brain tissue and the continuity of the hamartoma with the leptomeninges were striking. In recent findings about the development of meninges and brain commissures, the origin of this disorder is explained as a defective resorption of the embryonic meninx primitiva. This disorder then causes other developmental aberrations of the brain, which are often found in association. The varying microscopic pattern of these disorders can also be satisfactorily explained by their origin in the primitive meninx, which is formed from both mesenchyme and neuroectoderm.", "journal": "Ceskoslovenska patologie", "date": "2002-01-30", "authors": ["JZ\u00e1mecn\u00edk", "MKyncl"], "doi": null}

New vascularized granulation tissue will generate on this loop for up to 12 weeks. In the study described in this paper three different extracellular matrices were investigated for their ability to accelerate the amount of tissue generated compared with a no-matrix control. Poly-D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) produced the maximal weight of new tissue and vascularization and this peaked at two weeks, but regressed by four weeks. Matrigel was next best. It peaked at four weeks but by eight weeks it also had regressed. Fibrin (20 and 80 mg/ml), by contrast, did not integrate with the generating vascularized tissue and produced less weight and volume of tissue than controls without matrix. The limiting factors to growth appear to be the chamber size and the capacity of the neotissue to integrate with the matrix. Once the sides of the chamber are reached or tissue fails to integrate, encapsulation and regression follow. The intrinsic position of the blood supply within the neotissue has many advantages for tissue and organ engineering, such as ability to seed the construct with stem cells and microsurgically transfer new tissue to another site within the individual.

{"title": "[Aorto-enteric fistulas].", "abstract": "The aorto-enteric fistula (AEF) is a direct communication between aorta and intestinal lumen. There are primary and secondary forms. Primary AEFs are usually due to erosion of an aortic aneurysm (AAA) into the intestine, while secondary forms are caused by reconstructive procedures on the abdominal aorta. The incidence of primary AEF ranges from 0.1 to 0.8%, and secondary from 0.4% to 2.4% [2-4]. The mortality rate after surgical treatment of secondary AEFs is from 14% to 70% [5]. Therefore, they are of great medical importance. The aim of this paper is the presentation of 9 new cases.\nOver a 33-year period (1966-1999) a retrospective analysis of patients' records identified 9 patients with AEFs. All were males with average age of 66.62 (51-70) years. In Tables 1 and 2 are presented data on our cases. Of the total number of 9 patients, there were 4 primary and 5 secondary AEFs. All primary fistulas were caused by AAA rupture. Secondary AEFs developed after aortic abdominal surgery in the period between one and seven years after the operation. In 7 cases fistula involved the duodenum, in one the sigmoid and in one the transversal colon. The dominant manifestation of fistulas was gastrointestinal bleeding: melaena--8 (89%); haematemesis and melaena--2 (22%); proctorrhagia--1 (11%). In cases of primary AEFs gastrointestinal bleeding was followed by low back pain and haemorrhagic shok, while in cases of secondary AEFs by sepsis (fever, increased leucocytes count, sedimentation). In two cases the final diagnosis was established by gastrography and colonoscopy, while in two patients Duplex ultrasonographic examination suspected AEF. In all other cases the diagnosis was established intraoperatively (Figure 1). After aneurysmal resection in cases of primary AEFs, revascularization of the lower limbs was performed with extra-anatomic axillo-bifemoral bypass graft (one case) and with \"in situ\" graft placement (three cases) (Figure 2). The duodenal defect was closed transversally with standard two layers suture techniques in two patients without fistula excision, and in two cases after fistulas excision. In one case associated gastero-entero and entero-entero anastomosis was performed. In all cases with secondary AEFs, after removing of the previously implanted aortic graft, the aorta was closed just below the renal arteries root, and wrapped with a vascularized pedicle of omentum, to separate it from the bowel and the contained area. The duodenal defect was closed after fistulas excision using two layers transversal suture technique in two cases, and in one patient with large fistula a partial duodenectomy and Roux's procedure were necessary. In two patients in whom AEFs involved the transversal and sigmoid colon colostoma was performed. In three cases an extra-anatomic axillo-bifemoral bypass graft was performed for lower limbs revascularization, and in one patient bypass from the ascendent aorta to the femoral artery, using retroperitoneal route was carried out. In one patient the revascularization of the lower limbs was not done because of intraoperative death of the patient.\nSeven of our patients died during the first 15 postoperative days. One died during the operation after massive acute myocardial infarction. In other six cases the mortality causes were: MOFS-3 cases, and secondary enteric fistula-3 cases. Two of our patients survived. One has been followed-up for 15 years, and his axillo-bifemoral bypass is patent. The other with bypass from the ascendent aorta to the femoral artery died 7 years after the operation, also with patent graft. More details are given in Table 3.\nSir Astley Cooper was the first who described primary AEFs caused by AAA rupture in 1817 [6], and Brock in 1953, first described secondary AEF developed 6 months after aortic homograft implantation [8]. In 1957, Haberer successfully treated primary AEF by suture of the duodenal defect and aneurysmorrhaphy [9]. In our country Stojanovitsh and Vujadinovitsh in 1966, first treated primary AEF [16]. Their patient died due to MOFS. However, in 1984 and 1985, Lotina successfully treated two patients with secondary AEFs [11] (Figure 3, Sheme 1). The authors also analyzed literature data on the aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of AEFs. In conclusion, the authors suggest: 1. \"Omega\" extra-anatomic bypass from supraceliac artery trough retroperitonely to femoral arteries; 2. \"In situ\" replacement of the abdominal aorta using cadaveric homografts; 3.

{"title": "Hemangioblast commitment in the avian allantois: cellular and molecular aspects.", "abstract": "We recently identified the allantois as a site producing hemopoietic and endothelial cells capable of colonizing the bone marrow of an engrafted host. Here, we report a detailed investigation of some early cytological and molecular processes occurring in the allantoic bud, which are probably involved in the production of angioblasts and hemopoietic cells. We show that the allantois undergoes a program characterized by the prominent expression of several \"hemangioblastic\" genes in the mesoderm accompanied by other gene patterns in the associated endoderm. VEGF-R2, at least from stage HH17 onward, is expressed and is shortly followed by transcription factors GATA-2, SCL/tal-1, and GATA-1. Blood island-like structures differentiate that contain both CD45(+) cells and cells accumulating hemoglobin; these structures look exactly like blood islands in the yolk sac. This hemopoietic process takes place before the establishment of a vascular network connecting the allantois to the embryo. As far as the endoderm is concerned, GATA-3 mRNA is found in the region where allantois will differentiate before the posterior instestinal portal becomes anatomically distinct. Shortly before the bud grows out, GATA-2 was expressed in the endoderm and, at the same time, the hemangioblastic program became initiated in the mesoderm. GATA-3 is detected at least until E8 and GATA-2 until E3 the latest stage examined for this factor. Using in vitro cultures, we show that allantoic buds, dissected out before the establishment of circulation between the bud and the rest of the embryo, produced erythrocytes of the definitive lineage. Moreover, using heterospecific grafts between chick and quail embryos, we demonstrate that the allantoic vascular network develops from intrinsic progenitors. Taken together, these results extend our earlier findings about the commitment of mesoderm to the endothelial and hemopoietic lineages in the allantois. The detection of a prominent GATA-3 expression restricted to the endoderm of the preallantoic region and allantoic bud, followed by that of GATA-2, is an interesting and novel information, in the context of organ formation and endoderm specification in the emergence of hemopoietic cells.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2002-01-11", "authors": ["ACaprioli", "KMinko", "CDrevon", "AEichmann", "FDieterlen-Li\u00e8vre", "TJaffredo"], "doi": "10.1006/dbio.2001.0362"}

Controversy remains regarding the optimal anastomotic technique, but properly done, end-to-end anastomosis is readily reproducible and is associated with a low incidence of complications. Attempts to restore the bronchial circulation surgically are not associated with significant reductions in airway complications. Similarly, the routine use of vascularized soft tissue reinforcement no longer seems justified. Most complications can be managed readily with a combination of endoscopic techniques, including d\u00e9bridement (with or without laser or cryotherapy), dilation, and stent placement. Resective procedures rarely are indicated, and retransplantation should be reserved for exceptional cases.", "journal": "Chest surgery clinics of North America", "date": "2002-01-10", "authors": ["M SMulligan"], "doi": null}
{"title": "[Role of high resolution color-Doppler US of the sentinel node in patients with stage I melanoma].", "abstract": "The aims of the present work are to assess the diagnostic accuracy of high resolution color Doppler ultrasound (US) of the sentinel node (SN) in patients with cutaneous melanoma skin at stage I. The US findings of nodal involvement could spare the patient a surgical step (selective lymphaderectomy) allowing them to undergo radical lymphadenectomy directly.\nFrom November 1998 to November 2000 94 patients (mean age 52.7 years) underwent lymphoscintigraphy in order to mark the SN site on their skin. An US scan (112 lymphatic basins) was performed within 24 hours with a 10-13 MHz electronic linear probe with color-power-Doppler (Esaote AU5 Idea Scanner, Genoa, Italy). The sonographic features we analysed were: shape (roundness index), hilum displacement, intranodal heterogenicity, eccentric cortical thickness, extranodal invasion, vessel irregularity.\n26 nodes showed US findings consistent with malignant involvement, 86 were negative. All the nodes were surgically removed and controlled by histology. Sensitivity and specificity of US scanning were 89.4% and 90.3%, the positive and negative predictive values 65.3% and 97.6%, respectively. US correctly identified the involved SN in 15,1% cases, so that 17 patients could have avoided the selective lymphadenectomy\nPreoperative lymphoscintigraphy and high-resolution color-Doppler US scanning constitute a useful diagnostic tool in identifying the metastatic SN, with a low margin of error. False negatives were technically induced, even using the more recent scanners, by the low US probe resolution, unable to recognise metastatic microdeposits. The two most reliable parameters in identifying involved lymphnodes were the roundness index and the absence of hilar echo. The advent of technologically more advanced probes should allow better spatial resolution and assessment of lymph node vascularization, enabling diagnosis of metastasis measuring less than 2 mm in diameter.", "journal": "La Radiologia medica", "date": "2002-01-10", "authors": ["M CBossi", "SSanvito", "ELovati", "EDe Fiori", "ATestori", "MBellomi"], "doi": null}
{"title": "A new classification of free combined or connected tissue transfers: introduction to the concept of bridge, siamese, chimeric, mosaic, and chain-circle flaps.", "abstract": "Recently, combined tissues or flaps have been used for the repair of extensively massive or wide defects resulting from radical wide resection. To further advance the development of combined tissue transfers, they should be reclassified. Based on our cases with free tissue transfers, we have created a new classification of combined flaps composed of \"bridge\", \"chimeric\", \"siamese\", \"mosaic\", and \"chain-circle\" flaps. The bridge flap is fabricated out together of separate flaps with short vascular pedicles. These form a compound flap supplied with a solitary vascular source. The chimeric flap is compounded from multiple different flaps but consists of only a single different tissue form. Each of the flaps is usually supplied by different branches from the same source vessel. It differs from the bridge flap in that the pedicle of each flap or tissue has some length for its movement for transfer. The siamese connected flap has 2 adjacent flaps that are simultaneously elevated, and a disparate vascular pedicle for each flap must be reestablished. This connected flap has double isolated pedicles. Themosaic connected flap consists of 2 adjacent flaps that are simultaneously elevated, and the pedicle of the distal flap is anastomosed to the pedicle branch of the proximal flap in the \"bridge\" fashion. The vascular pedicle of the proximal flap is anastomosed to a single vascular source. The chain-circle flap has 2 or more flaps like the bridge and chimeric flaps, and the distal end of the vascular source is anastomosed to the branch of the recipient vessel. Based on results with our patients, the lateral circumflex femoral system seems to be the most suitable candidate for the axial pedicle of these combined flaps, because the system has several branches of large and small caliber, and several tissue components, such as the vascularized ilium, rectus femoris muscle, gracilis muscle, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and fascia lata, are located nearby.", "journal": "Acta medica Okayama", "date": "2002-01-10", "authors": ["IKoshima"], "doi": "10.18926/AMO/31999"}

To avoid postoperative ischaemia of the lower leg, adequate perfusion must be guaranteed before sacrificing the peroneal vessels. Anatomical variations and peripheral arterial occlusive disease add to the risk of ischaemia. Various methods of evaluating the blood supply have been described.\nFifty-two consecutive cases of fibular flaps were evaluated to study the arterial blood supply of the lower extremity. For angiography, the right femoral artery was punctured using the Seldinger technique and a total of 20-25 ml contrast medium (Imeron 300) was infused and images required at a rate of 0.5/sec.\nA patent three-vessel supply to both feet could only be detected in 21 patients. Thirty-one angiograms revealed anatomic and/or arteriosclerotic alterations. Angiography provided accurate information in all patients and allowed successful fibular transfer in those patients who were found preoperatively to have regular conditions.\nPreoperative assessment of the blood supply of the lower extremity is important before fibular osteocutaneous free tissue transfer.

{"title": "Scaphoid nonunions. Pitfalls and pearls.", "abstract": "Our ability to treat scaphoid nonunions has improved dramatically. The degree of collapse and bone loss can be accurately assessed in waist fractures using sagittal images on CT scans. These nonunions require reduction and bone grafting to re-establish the normal geometry of the scaphoid. Magnetic resonance imaging helps evaluate whether or not avascular necrosis is present in the proximal pole. Because of the poor prognosis of conventional bone grafts, a vascularized bone graft is recommended as the primary treatment when AVN is present. The volar collapse of the humpback deformity is best corrected with a volar approach and the proximal pole nonunion is best approached using a dorsal approach. Nearly all proximal pole nonunions require a vascularized bone graft and all acute proximal pole fractures require open reduction and internal fixation. Using specially designed cannulated screws, the nonunions can be stabilized accurately to decrease the time to resolution of the nonunion and minimize the amount of time in a cast. Stable fixation requires that the screw fixation target the central portion of the scaphoid regardless of the type of screw design used. Using these techniques, the hand surgeon should be able to provide a reasonable prognosis for patients presenting with a scaphoid nonunion, and the treatment should result in functional range of motion, grip strength, and relief of pain.", "journal": "Hand clinics", "date": "2002-01-05", "authors": ["TTrumble", "WNyland"], "doi": null}

Xenotransplantation (i.e., the transplantation of organs [tissues or cells] between different species) appears to be a reasonable solution. However, various problems (immunological, physiological, infectious-microbiological, ethical-juridicial) seem to be associated with xenotransplantation. One of the most formidable barriers to xenotransplantation is the phenomenon of hyperacute rejection that may lead to the destruction of the transplanted vascularized organ in a few minutes to hours. In the pathogenesis of hyperacute rejection, xenoreactive antibodies and the complement system appear to be of primary importance. Various methods can be applied to prevent hyperacute rejection; both the recipient and the donor can be treated.

Previously, it was shown that this response was characterized by serosal growth (thickening) which was apparent after 1 day of obstruction, before any visible vascularization was observed. After 1 week of obstruction, significant microvessel formation was seen in the transition region between the detrusor smooth muscle and the thickening serosa; after 2 weeks the entire serosa was vascularized. In this study we investigated the effect of chronic (4 week) partial outlet obstruction on microvessel density and distribution in the bladder wall immunohistochemically using CD31 as a marker for vascular endothelium. Transverse sections of bladder wall were examined after 4 weeks of no surgery, sham surgery or partial obstruction. The microvessel density of the obstructed rabbit bladder mucosa and detrusor smooth muscle increased relative to augmentation of these compartments while new vessels appeared in the thickening serosa.

Evaluation of microvasculature was perfomed by counting the microvessel density (MVD) in selected areas under light microscope as well as by computer assisted image analysis (CAIA). In the latter, the following parameters were used for assessment of microvessels: mean number/field, mean area of the vessels, total area/field and total perimeter/field. MVD values obtained under optical microscope and with CAIA were highly correlated. All parameters characterising microvasculature in CAIA also revealed a significant correlation with the histological grading of tumours; generally the less differentiated tumours manifested more extensive vascular network. No significant relationship was found between the tumour size and any of the CAIA parameters. The area of vessels (both total and mean values) revealed a significant, inverse correlation with the incidence of lymph node metastases.

{"title": "[Osteosynthesis techniques in proximal humeral fractures].", "abstract": "Although proximal humeral fractures are common injuries, there is no generally accepted strategy as to how unstable and displaced two- to four-part fractures should be managed. Surgical therapy is in a conflicting situation between the requirement for anatomical fracture reduction and stable fixation, on the one hand, and the necessity for minimal intraoperative damage to the soft tissue and arterial vascularization of the humeral head in order to avoid avascular necrosis on the other. Whereas minimally invasive procedures using closed or percutaneous reduction and fixation techniques are advantageous for protection of the arterial blood supply of the proximal humerus, plate fixation provides superior fixation stability. Plate fixation seems to be associated with a reduced risk of avascular necrosis when indirect reduction techniques are used. Poor results in the operative management of humeral head fractures are often seen in association with malunion. There is therefore a tendency towards the use of implants with angular stability in order to reduce the risk for secondary loss of reduction during functional after treatment. Innovative new plates and intramedullary nails that provide superior stability of fixation of the humeral head fragment have been actually introduced into clinical practice.

We examined the NOS expression in 35 oligodendrogliomas, WHO grade II, and 7 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, WHO grade III, by immunohistochemical methods using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. We observed only a minor expression of nNOS and sparse expression of eNOS in the tumor cells, but a vivid expression of eNOS in the vascular endothelial cells in both the tumor and the surrounding tissue. The rich expression of eNOS in oligodendroglioma vessels independent of tumor grade may suggest that blood flow and angiogenesis in these richly vascularized tumors are modified by NO. Interestingly, enhanced expression of inducible NOS was observed in the oligodendroglial tumor cells in 19 of 35 oligodendrogliomas (54%) and in 2 of 7 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (29%). This is diverging for iNOS expression in astroglial tumors and the data could be indicative of iNOS exerting anti-tumor activity which may protract the progression from low-grade oligodendrogliomas to more anaplastic types.", "journal": "Clinical neuropathology", "date": "2002-01-05", "authors": ["HBroholm", "OBraendstrup", "MLauritzen"], "doi": null}

The authors report a 65-year-old man who sustained a chronic wound after operative repair of a chronic rupture of the Achilles' tendon. A pedicled medial plantar flap including the surrounding vascularized plantar aponeurosis was elevated. The plantar aponeurosis was split and used to bridge the 4-cm-long tendon defect. The flap donor site was covered with a thin skin graft. The flap survived completely without recurrence of the infection. At the 7-month follow-up, the reconstructed Achilles' tendon showed a good functional result and a normal range of dorsi- and plantar flexion of the foot.

{"title": "Placental circulation: Clinical significance.", "abstract": "Investigation of the mechanisms regulating development of new vessels is crucial to our understanding of both tumor biology and early pregnancy development. The placental vascular system develops through two distinct processes: vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. During vasculogenesis, endothelial progenitor cells angioblasts form a primitive vascular network. Angiogenesis represents the development of new vessels from preexisting vessels. Placental vascular growth begins as early as 21 days post conceptionem and continues throughout gestation. The development of villous capillaries from hemangioblastic cells can be observed until 10-12 weeks of gestation. From 12 weeks onwards, the capillaries coil, bulge, form sinusoids and protrude towards the trophoblastic layer. Although reliable signs of formation of new vessels are absent in the second half of pregnancy, some capillary sprouts can be seen. Human placenta is a rich source of angiogenic substances and these may play an important role in the regulation of placental vessel formation as well as in maternal vascular adaptation to pregnancy. Disturbances in the placental vascular development as demonstrated by reduced fetal capillary branching, maldevelopment of the villous tree and/or alterations in the expression of angiogenic factors in the fetomaternal unit, are associated with following pathologic conditions in pregnancy: early pregnancy losses preeclampsia intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) gestational diabetes and maternal diabetes mellitus Our understanding of the different molecular and functional aspects of the placental vessel formation during gestation might allow the establishment of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pregnancy related pathology.", "journal": "Early pregnancy", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["MZygmunt"], "doi": null}

The aim of our study was to assess the vascularity of the yolk sac and vitelline duct in 150 patients between the 6th and 10th weeks of normal, and uncomplicated pregnancies who were scheduled for termination of pregnancy for psychosocial reasons and 130 complicated pregnancies. In same patients volume of the yolk sac was assessed using Combison 530 3D Voluson, Medison-Kretz Company. Overall visualization rate for yolk sac vessels was 80,38%. The highest visualization rates were obtained in the 7th and 8th weeks of gestation reaching values of 90,71 %. In the same period the visualization rates of the vitelline duct arteries were 87,71% and 91,28% respectively. A characteristic waveform profile included low velocity (5,8+/-1,7 cm/s) and absence of diastolic flow which was obtained from all examined yolk sacs. The PI showed the mean value of 3,24+/-0,94 without significant changes between subgroups (p>0,05). Vitelline vessels showed similar PSV (5,4+/-1,8 cm/s) and PI values (3,14+/0,91) (p>0,05) to that obtained from the yolk sac. Three types of abnormal vascular signals were derived from the yolk sac in patients with missed abortion (n=32): irregular blood flow (n=6), permanent diastolic flow (n=2) and venous blood flow signals (n=5). However, in the most of the patients (n=19) blood flow signals could not have been extracted from these early embryonic structures. Using three-dimensional ultrasound we found a positive correlation between gestational age and volumes of the gestational and yolk sac until 10 weeks gestation. At the end of the first trimester yolk sac volume remained constant, while gestational sac volume continued to grow. It seems that changes in both yolk sac appearance (size, shape, volume and echogenicity) and vascularization are probably a consequence of poor embryonic development or even embryonic death, rather than being a primary cause of an early pregnancy failure.", "journal": "Early pregnancy", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["SKupesic", "AKurjak"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Cardiomyocyte apoptotic cell death in arterial hypertension: mechanisms and potential management.", "abstract": "Hypertensive heart disease is a progressive condition in which the compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy that maintains cardiac output leads to myocardial remodeling, characterized by fibrosis, insufficient vascularization, and alterations in cardiomyocytes, including contractile disturbances, changes in gene expression, and decrease in the number of cells. Structural abnormalities in the myocardial wall accelerate the development of diastolic and systolic dysfunction, resulting in heart failure. Many observations point to the apoptotic cell death of cardiomyocytes as a relevant factor in the transition from compensatory hypertrophy to pump failure in experimental and human hypertension. Potential inducers of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in overloaded hearts include extrinsic factors, such as mechanical forces, neurohormonal activation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and cytokines. Some lines of evidence indicate that angiotensin II and the overstretching of cardiomyocytes are originally involved in the triggering of apoptosis in hypertension, whereas other factors are being investigated. Furthermore, intracellular changes, such as downregulation of survival proteins or activation of death proteins, seem to play an important role. The assumption that the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes worsens hypertensive heart disease prognosis brings forth new approaches to avoid or slow the transition to pump failure. In this respect, experimental data indicate that currently used antihypertensive drugs interfere with cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Moreover, the knowledge of intracellular apoptotic processes in cardiomyocytes provides novel therapeutic strategies to be added to the multimodal approach in the prevention of heart failure.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["M AFortu\u00f1o", "SRavassa", "AFortu\u00f1o", "GZalba", "JD\u00edez"], "doi": "10.1161/hy1201.099615"}

The impact of the microenvironment on these factors was studied using osteosarcomas implanted either subcutaneously or orthotopically around the femur in athymic mice. The uptake of IgG was found to correlate inversely with the interstitial fluid pressure and the tumour volume in orthotopic, but not subcutaneous tumours. No correlation was found between IgG uptake and the level of any of the extracellular matrix constituents. The content of both collagen and glycosaminoglycans depended on the site of tumour growth. The orthotopic tumours had a higher vascular density than the subcutaneous tumours, as the vascular surface and length were 2-3-fold higher.

To address this issue, beads presoaked with the potent angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were implanted in the vicinity of the prospective digit 2 in early chick embryo wing buds and the effects on angiogenesis and digit development were determined over time. We found that VEGF treatment caused a marked local increase in blood vessel number and density. Strikingly, this was accompanied by inhibition of digit 2 development as revealed by lack of expression of chondrogenic transcription factor Sox9 and absence of Alcian blue staining. Vascular distribution and skeletal development in adjacent areas remained largely unaffected. Inhibition of digit formation and excess vascularization were both reversible upon further embryonic growth and dissipation of VEGF activity. When supernumerary digits were induced at the anterior limb margin by retinoic acid treatment, their development was also preceded by vascular regression; interestingly, cotreatment with VEGF inhibited supernumerary digit development as well. Direct exposure of limb mesenchymal cells in micromass cultures to VEGF caused no obvious effects on condensation and chondrogenesis, indicating that VEGF effects are not due to direct action on skeletal cells. Our results are the first to provide evidence that vascular regression is required for mesenchymal condensation and chondrogenesis.

{"title": "Functional outcome of new blood vessel growth into ischemic skeletal muscle.", "abstract": "The administration of angiogenic growth factors and the transfer of well-vascularized tissues have been shown to induce development of new blood vessels in ischemic muscle. The functional significance of these new vessels is unknown. The hypothesis of this study is that the transfer of vascularized muscle and the local infusion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) synergistically improve contractile function of ischemic skeletal muscle.\nTwenty-six rabbits were divided into four groups. An ischemic hindlimb was created in each by ligating the right common iliac artery. The flap + bFGF group (n = 6) had transposition of a contralateral rectus muscle flap onto the thigh. Additionally, bFGF (3 ng/h) was continuously infused at the flap-thigh interface. In the flap group (n = 6), a similar muscle flap was created, but carrier solution was infused at the interface. In the bFGF group (n = 6), no muscle flap was created; instead, bFGF (3 ng/h) was infused into the external iliac artery of the ischemic limb. In the control group (n = 8), carrier solution was infused into the external iliac artery (no flap, no bFGF). After 1 week, the soleus muscle was isolated and stimulated. Maximum twitch tension, the fatigue index (force of contraction after 2 minutes of continuous stimulation/initial force of contraction), maximum recovery, and the number of limbs recovered (ie, limbs that achieve a force of contraction during the recovery period of > 75% of the force of the initial contraction at the start of continuous stimulation) were recorded. Blood vessel density (number of vessels per ***) was determined by immunostaining the soleus muscle with anti-alpha-actin antibody.\nAll values were indexed to the contralateral normal limb. The flap + bFGF group showed significant improvement versus the control group in maximum twitch tension (1.07 +/- 0.13 vs 0.63 +/- 0.12, P < .05), maximum recovery (0.94 +/- 0.05 vs 0.58 +/- 0.05, P < .05), and the number of limbs recovered (5/5 vs 0/6, P < .05). This improved function correlated with increased vessel density (flap + bFGF group, 1.44 +/- 0.11 vs control group, 0.72 +/- 0.01, P < .05).\nReperfusion of an ischemic limb with a well-vascularized muscle flap and local bFGF infusion promoted increased blood vessel density in distal ischemic muscle. This increased vascularity was associated with restoration of otherwise impaired muscle function. Improved function occurred rapidly (1 week).

This study was designed to clarify the potential efficacy of amrinone in plastic surgery by clinically assessing its ability to enhance flap blood flow after reconstructive surgery and relieve intraoperative vasospasm. Its effects were compared with those of prostaglandin E1 and lidocaine, which are widely approved agents for improving the hemodynamics of flaps. In the first clinical study, the effects on flap blood flow after flap transfers were investigated. Twenty-six patients underwent reconstructive surgery with vascularized free or pedicled flaps. Blood flow was measured before and 60 minutes after intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer solution (control), amrinone (10 microg/kg/min), or prostaglandin E1 (10 ng/kg/min) using a laser Doppler flowmeter. In the second study, the effects on relief of vasospasm during operation were evaluated. The blood flow of 28 island flaps was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry immediately after flap elevation and 10 minutes after topical application of saline (control), amrinone (5 mg/ml), or lidocaine (10%) to the pedicle in an attempt to resolve the vasospasm. In both clinical studies, the effects of amrinone were statistically no less than those of prostaglandin E1 and lidocaine.

The development of models, which fully recapitulate spatio-temporal events involved during these processes, are crucial to fully understand their mechanisms of regulation. In vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells has been shown to be a useful tool to investigate factors and genes potentially involved in vasculogenesis (Hirashima et al, 1999; Risau et al, 1988; Vittet et al, 1996; Wang et al, 1992; Wartenberg et al, 1998). We asked here whether this model system can also recapitulate angiogenesis, which may offer new means to study mechanisms involved in this process. ES-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) obtained after 11 days of differentiation, in which a primitive vascular network had formed, were then subcultured into a type I collagen matrix. In the presence of angiogenic growth factors, EBs rapidly developed branching pseudopods. Whole mount immunostainings with a PECAM antibody revealed that more than 75% EBs displayed, within a few days, a large number of endothelial outgrowths that can give tube-like structures with concomitant differentiation of alpha-smooth muscle actin positive cells, thus evoking sprouting angiogenesis. High expression levels of flk1 (VEGFR2), flt1 (VEGFR1), tie-1, and tie-2 are also found, indicating that budding endothelial cells displayed an angiogenic phenotype. The endothelial sprouting response was specifically induced by angiogenic factors with a major contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Known angiostatic agents, such as platelet factor 4 (PF4), angiostatin, and endostatin inhibited the formation of endothelial sprouts induced by angiogenic factors. Moreover, consistent with the in vivo phenotype, VE-cadherin deficient EBs failed to develop angiogenesis in this model. ES cell differentiation can then recapitulate, in addition to vasculogenesis, the early stages of sprouting angiogenesis.

{"title": "Neovastat, a naturally occurring multifunctional antiangiogenic drug, in phase III clinical trials.", "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated that bone marrow angiogenesis is increased in multiple myeloma, suggesting that treatment with an antiangiogenic agent might be useful. Among the new antiangiogenic drugs in development, Neovastat (AE-941; Aeterna Laboratories, Quebec City, Canada) can be classified as a naturally occurring multifunctional antiangiogenic agent. It has a marked inhibitory effect on the formation of blood vessels in the chicken embryo vascularization assay (EVT) and endothelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that oral administration of Neovastat blocks the formation of blood vessels in Matrigel implants containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The antiangiogenic activity of Neovastat was found to be associated with two mechanisms of action. In addition to the inhibition of the matrix metalloproteinase activities (MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12), Neovastat inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to endothelial cells, VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, and VEGF-induced vascular permeability in mice. Neovastat was also found to have a significant antitumor activity. Oral administration of Neovastat in mice with subcutaneous grafted breast cancer (DA3) cells showed a significant reduction in tumor volume. Neovastat also decreased the number of lung metastases in the Lewis lung carcinoma model. Interestingly, the effect of Neovastat was additive to cisplatin in this model. Furthermore, no treatment-related mortality or loss of body weight was observed. Also, toxicology studies in rats and monkeys demonstrate no dose-limiting toxicity or target organ damage after 1 year of chronic exposure, thus suggesting that Neovastat could be safely administered in humans. Four clinical studies have been conducted to establish the dosing, safety, and early efficacy of Neovastat administered orally.

Graves' disease was diagnosed according to the usual clinical and laboratory criteria. On the basis of the clinical and biochemical findings we divided Graves' patients into 4 different groups. Treatment was continued for at least 12 months, CDU examination was carried out after discontinuing therapy. Eight patients showed a relapse of hyperthyroidism within 5 months after suspension of therapy. In all cases the evaluation of intraparenchymal vascularization and PSV at the level of the inferior thyroid artery in basal conditions was followed by administration of contrast agent (Levovist, 300 mg/ml), with slow infusion (<2 ml/min) to avoid blooming artifact. Intraparenchymal vascularization was classified into 4 patterns according to Vitti et al.\nThe value of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the level of the inferior thyroid artery was the best predictor of relapse. A value higher than 40 cm/sec was present in all the patients that showed relapse and only in two patients with stable remission. Administration of contrast agent is important to evaluate the biological activity of the disease. In the 5 patients exhibiting slightly increased vascularization after contrast agent administration we could assume the clinico-pathological recovery.\nCDU study of thyroid vascularization, based on the measurement of PSV at the level of the inferior thyroid artery and on the response to contrast agent administration is useful to distinguish three groups of patients: A) PSV >40 cm/sec with pattern III for at least 10 minutes from the beginning of the contrast agent administration (High risk of relapse); B) PSV <40 cm/sec with pattern II or III after contrast agent administration (Biological activity of the disease-Thyroiditis); C) PSV <40 cm/sec with Pattern I after contrast agent administration (Poor biological activity of the disease-recovery).", "journal": "La Radiologia medica", "date": "2001-12-12", "authors": ["FAmodio", "SDi Martino", "SEsposito", "SIorio", "JHierholzer", "GRea", "ABizzarro", "GVallone"], "doi": null}

Macroscopic observation showed that CHO-ET-1 cell aggregates formed highly vascularized nodules surrounded by radially rearranged vessels, with a strong angiogenic response. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) studies showed an increase in endothelial cell proliferation in the CAM vasculature around CHO-ET-1 nodules. An angiogenic response was also observed with gelatin sponges containing conditioned medium from CHO-ET-1 cells. The specific involvement of ET-1 in the angiogenic effect mediated by CHO-ET-1 was demonstrated by the reduction or abolition of neovascularized CHO-ET-1 nodules by (1) bosentan, a mixed antagonist of ET(A)/ET(B) receptors, (2) an ET(A) receptor antagonist (Ru69986) and (3) phosporamidon, an inhibitor of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1). We also demonstrated that VEGF was involved in CHO-ET-1-mediated angiogenesis, by using a specific inhibitor of VEGF tyrosine kinase receptor activity (PTK787/ZK 222584), which abolished CHO-ET-1 nodule formation and CAM neovascularization.

Both SF-resident matrix metalloproteases and cathepsins have been implicated in cartilage degradation although their identities and individual contributions remain unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression of cathepsin K in SFs, the correlation between cathepsin K expression and disease severity, and the contribution of cathepsin K to fibroblast-mediated collagen degradation. Immunostaining of joint specimens of 21 patients revealed high expression of cathepsin K in SFs in the synovial lining and the stroma of synovial villi, and to a lesser extent in CD68-positive cells of the synovial lining. Cathepsin K-positive SFs were consistently observed at sites of cartilage and bone degradation. Expression levels of cathepsin K in the sublining and vascularized areas of inflamed synovia showed a highly significant negative correlation with results derived from the Hannover Functional Capacity Questionnaire (r = 0.78, P = 0.003; and r = 0.70, P = 0.012, respectively) as a measure of the severity of RA in individual patients. For comparison, there was no correlation between Hannover Functional Capacity Questionnaire and cathepsin S whose expression is limited to CD-68-positive macrophage-like synoviocytes. The expression of cathepsin K was also demonstrated in primary cell cultures of RA-SFs. Co-cultures of SFs on cartilage disks revealed the ability of fibroblast-like cells to phagocytose collagen fibrils whose intralysosomal hydrolysis was prevented in the presence of a potent cathepsin K inhibitor but not by an inhibitor effective against cathepsins L, B, and S. The selective and critical role of cathepsin K in articular cartilage and subchondral bone erosion was further corroborated by the finding that cathepsin K has a potent aggrecan-degrading activity and that cathepsin K-generated aggrecan cleavage products specifically potentiate the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K toward type I and II collagens. This study demonstrates for the first time a critical role of cathepsin K in cartilage degradation by SFs in RA that is comparable to its well-known activity in osteoclasts.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2001-12-06", "authors": ["W SHou", "ZLi", "R EGordon", "KChan", "M JKlein", "RLevy", "MKeysser", "GKeyszer", "DBr\u00f6mme"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63068-4"}
{"title": "Oncogenic co-operation in beta-cell tumorigenesis.", "abstract": "Pancreatic islet neoplasms are rare endocrine tumours. The most common type is of beta-cell origin and is known as insulinoma, which can be either benign or malignant. The majority of insulinomas arise sporadically, but a small proportion develop as part of the hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. As for many human tumours, the genetic events that occur during the initiation and progression of insulinoma are poorly known. The men1 gene product, menin, is deficient in most hereditary cases, but is not obviously affected in the majority of sporadic tumours. Activation of the proto-oncogenes c-myc and ras has been observed during malignant progression, but their role in tumour initiation remains unproven. To address these questions, transgenic mouse models have been increasingly used to explore molecular and genetic events that might also precipitate human neoplasia. Transgenic mice expressing SV40 large T-antigen (Tag) oncogene in beta-cells develop tumours in a multi-stage progression from hyperplasia, angiogenesis, to solid encapsulated tumours. However, Tag, which inactivates the key tumour suppressors p53 and Rb, is not known to be involved in the pathogenesis of human insulinoma. The proto-oncogene, c-myc is implicated in beta-cell growth in both diabetes and tumorigenesis. Activation of Myc appears to be an early event in progression of human insulinoma. The effect of deregulated Myc expression on adult beta-cells in vivo has recently been investigated by developing transgenic mouse models in which the activity of Myc can be regulated ectopically. Although Myc activation initially promotes both proliferation and apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cells, apoptosis is the predominant outcome, giving rise to islet involution and diabetes. Importantly, inhibiting Myc-induced apoptosis (by co-expression of Bcl-x(L)) leads to significantly enlarged islets, many becoming highly vascularized, hyperplastic and invasive. These results suggest that, in the pancreatic beta-cells, early suppression of apoptosis is essential for the survival of Myc-activated beta-cells and islet neoplasia.", "journal": "Endocrine-related cancer", "date": "2001-12-06", "authors": ["SPelengaris", "MKhan"], "doi": "10.1677/erc.0.0080307"}

A scanning electron microscopic study of microvascular corrosion casts.", "abstract": "The microvasculature of the corpus epididymis of adult domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) was studied using the technique of scanning electron microscopy of microvascular corrosion casts. The vascularization of the dog's corpus epididymis is accomplished by small arteries that course in the upper border of the organ. From these vessels arise first order arterioles (200-101 microm) which cross the surface of the epididymis and often show some coiling. The latter vessels supply second order arterioles (100-31 microm) which vascularize segments of the epididymal duct. The coiled and tight course of this duct is responsible for its peculiar microvascular arrangement. This is characterized by a 'bicycle-wheel' pattern and it is provided with precapillary or terminal arterioles (30-11 microm) nourishing a rich periductal network, mostly formed by anastomosing capillaries (10-3 microm). The periductal capillary network drains into postcapillary (11-30 microm), second order (31-100 microm) and first order (101-200 microm) venules, which empty into small calibre veins that course in the upper border of the epididymis. Anastomoses between vessels of the same type are often found. These are arteriovenous anastomoses mainly located at the periductal network. This study demonstrates that the epididymal microvasculature can be subdivided into a distribution microvascular network (DMN), formed by first and second order arterioles and venules, which presents a behaviour independent of the epididymal duct's sinuosities and a nutrition microvascular network (NMN), formed by precapillary arterioles, capillaries and post-capillary venules, characterised by the close relationship of the vessels with the loops of the epididymal duct.", "journal": "Italian journal of anatomy and embryology = Archivio italiano di anatomia ed embriologia", "date": "2001-12-06", "authors": ["DPais", "J AEsperan\u00e7a-Pina"], "doi": null}

We reported previously that overexpression of two VEGF isoforms, VEGF(121) and VEGF(165), by human glioma U87 MG cells induced tumor-associated intracerebral hemorrhage, whereas expression of a third form, VEGF(189), did not cause vessel rupture. Here, we test whether these VEGF isoforms have distinct activities for enhancing vascularization and growth of gliomas in mice. U87 MG cells that overexpressed VEGF(165) or VEGF(189) grew more rapidly than the parental cells in both s.c. and intracranial (i.c.) locations. However, cells that overexpressed VEGF(121) only showed enhancement of i.c. tumor growth but had a minimal effect on s.c. glioma progression. At both anatomical sties, VEGF(165) and VEGF(189) strongly augmented neovascularization, whereas VEGF(121) only increased vessel density in brain tumors. In each type of glioma, expression of VEGF receptors -1 and -2 largely phenocopied the tumor vasculature, because increased VEGF/VEGF receptor-activated microvessel densities were strongly correlated with the angiogenicity and tumorigenicity elicited by the VEGF isoforms at both anatomical sites. One notable difference between the sites was the expression of vitronectin, a prototypic ligand of alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins, detected in i.c. but not in s.c., gliomas. Endothelial cell migration stimulated by VEGF(121) was potentiated by vitronectin to a greater extent than that stimulated by VEGF(165).

Corrosion casts of the entire choroidal vasculature showed that the ophthalmic artery branched into two main ciliary arteries: the nasal and temporal arteries, which extend forward to form the iridociliary circle. Further the inferior ciliary artery arises from the temporal ciliary artery. In the posterior eye segment these arteries form four to seven branches supplying the adjacent choriocapillaris. There are different arrangements of choriocapillaris. The larger veins formed four vortex veins, one in each quadrant, draining blood from the anterior region of the choroid or iris.

{"title": "The physiological environment in cancer vascularization, invasion and metastasis.", "abstract": "One of the most lethal aspects of cancer arises from its ability to invade and metastasize. Determining the factors that promote cancer cell invasion and metastasis is therefore critically important in treating this disease. The tumour physiological environment is uniquely different from normal tissue, and exhibits hypoxia, acidic extracellular pH and high levels of lactate. This environment, dictated largely by abnormal tumour vasculature and metabolism, in turn also promotes angiogenesis. The physiological environment, tumour metabolism, angiogenesis and vascularization are therefore inextricably linked. We have developed and applied non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (I) and spectroscopy (S) techniques to understand the role of vascular, physiological and metabolic properties in cancer invasion and metastasis. These MR studies are performed with human breast and prostate cancer cells maintained in culture or grown as solid tumours in immune-suppressed mice. We have detected significant differences in vascular, physiological and metabolic characteristics of metastatic and non-metastatic human breast and prostate cancer models with MRI and MRS. Using a combined MRI/MRS approach we are currently acquiring metabolic, extracellular pH and vascular images from the same localized regions within a solid tumour to further understand the dynamics between these parameters and their role in cancer invasion and metastasis.", "journal": "Novartis Foundation symposium", "date": "2001-12-01", "authors": ["Z MBhujwalla", "DArtemov", "EAboagye", "EAckerstaff", "R JGillies", "KNatarajan", "MSolaiyappan"], "doi": "10.1002/0470868716.ch3"}

Somatic cell genetics was applied to a fibroblastic cell line (CCOL39) to disrupt either aerobic glycolysis, respiration, or a major pHi-regulating system, the Na-H exchanger (NHE1). We obtained stable mutants impaired either in phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi-), which produce virtually no lactic acid, or in respiration (res-), which over secrete lactic acid (three- to fourfold the wild-type rate). These mutations, which allowed us to analyse the incidence of lactic acid production on tumour development in nude mice, were analysed alone, or in combination, with the mutation nhe1- to evaluate in vivo the role of NHE1 on pHi control and cell proliferation. Ras-transformed pgi- cells (not forming lactic acid) form tumours like wild type transformed cells (100% incidence). The disruption of NHE1 however, strongly reduced tumour incidence to about 20%. In cells bearing both mutations, nhe1-, res-, and which therefore over-produce lactic acid, the situation is even more dramatic (0% incidence). In sharp contrast, association of nhe1- with pgi- restored 100% tumour incidence. We conclude that over-production of lactic acid is detrimental for tumour development and that NHE1, by controlling pHi, plays a key role in cell survival/proliferation and tumour growth. Finally we summarize our current knowledge on the signalling mechanisms leading to VEGF expression, another key component of tumour growth via neo-vascularization.", "journal": "Novartis Foundation symposium", "date": "2001-12-01", "authors": ["JPouyss\u00e9gur", "AFranchi", "GPag\u00e8s"], "doi": "10.1002/0470868716.ch13"}

However, proliferation was inhibited completely by systemic administration of angiostatin without affecting normal retinal vascularization. After intravitreal injection of angiostatin, pathologic proliferation of the retinal blood vessels was impaired by 62%. Neither systemic nor intravitreal treatment impaired the development or growth of organs throughout the body.\nAngiostatin inhibits oxygen-induced intravitreal pathologic retinal angiogenesis without affecting the development of physiological retinal vascularization, development, and growth of newborn mice.

Schwann cells are known to play an important role in regulating nerve growth and survival in other tissues, but they have not been examined in human pathologic intervertebral discs.\nSerial sections of human intervertebral discs were immunostained for the neuronal markers (neurofilament 200, peripherin, protein gene product 9.5), for the Schwann cell marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and for the endothelial cell marker (CD34).\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein-immunopositive cells colocalized with nerves in degenerate discs, but were absent or rarely observed in nondegenerate, aneural discs. These also were seen in the disc matrix, independently of nerves. Much of the nerve and Schwann cell ingrowth was found in vascularized areas of disc tissue, where the lamellar structure of the anulus fibrosus was disrupted. Blood vessels were observed deeper into the discs than nerves or Schwann cells.\nThe appearance of glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunopositive cells in diseased intervertebral discs was closely associated with nerve ingrowth.

In nine minipigs 600 microgram rhOP-1 were used with 8 ml xenogenic bone mineral (BioOss, Geistlich, Waldenburg, Germany) as a carrier and inserted into a pouch prepared in the M. latissimus dorsi. After 6, 12, and 24 weeks the grafts were harvested. The results were evaluated using computed tomography, histology, macro- and microangiography. A high yield of newly formed bone was obtained on the osteoconductive scaffold of the xenogenic bone. It was possible to create a vascularized osseous graft in the given shape of the BioOss blocks. In cross-sections, 68% of the scaffold was coated with new bone. The amount of new bone did not differ between the prefabrication times. Bone overgrowth was 2.1% of the graft volume.

We demonstrated recently that NAC has anti-invasive, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenic effects in in vitro and in vivo test systems. In the present study, s.c. transplantation of KS-Imm cells in (CD-1)BR nude mice resulted in the local growth of Kaposi's sarcoma, a highly vascularized human tumor. The daily administration of NAC with drinking water, initiated after the tumor mass had become established and detectable, produced a sharp inhibition of tumor growth, with regression of tumors in half of the treated mice along with a markedly prolonged median survival time. The production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and certain proliferation markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki-67) were significantly lower in Kaposi's sarcomas from NAC-treated mice than from control mice. Treatment of KS-Imm cells with NAC in vitro resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of chemotaxis and invasion through inhibition of gelatinase-A (matrix metalloproteinase-2, MMP-2) activity without altering MMP-2 or MMP-9 mRNA levels. NAC also significantly inhibited VEGF production but did not affect proliferation markers in vitro. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that total VEGF mRNAs were reduced by 10 mM NAC. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that NAC, the safety of which even at high doses has been established in almost 40 years of clinical use, in addition to its chemopreventive action, has a strong antiangiogenic potential that could be exploited for preventing cancer progression as well as used in cancer adjuvant therapy.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2001-11-24", "authors": ["AAlbini", "MMorini", "FD'Agostini", "NFerrari", "FCampelli", "GArena", "D MNoonan", "CPesce", "SDe Flora"], "doi": null}

As a result, cartilage-sparing otoplasty such as the Mustard\u00e9 and Furnas types has been increasingly popular. However, postauricular suture extrusion may result, and recurrence rates of up to 25 percent have been recorded. In this study, cartilage-sparing otoplasty is refined by the addition of a postauricular fascial flap to reduce suture extrusion and recurrence rates. Fifty-one patients underwent otoplasty (45 bilateral, six unilateral). This technique involves the elevation of a fascial flap from the postauricular region. A new antihelical fold is then created by Mustard\u00e9 sutures, and the conchal bowl is rotated by Furnas-type concha-mastoid sutures. The fascial flap is then advanced to cover the sutures with a supplementary vascularized layer to prevent suture extrusion. In addition, the advancement of the flap acts as a postauricular support to prevent recurrence. A natural-looking antihelical fold and helical rim is created by this technique. There were no hematomas. There was recurrence in eight ears (8 percent) in six patients. Two patients requested further surgery. No patients developed suture extrusion or granuloma. This is a simple and intrinsically safe procedure and does not cause irreparable complications such as anterior scarring or skin necrosis.

Treatments targeted at tumour vasculature have produced impressive results in animal models (Lindsay et al, 1996; Watson et al, 1996; O'Reilly, 1997; Horsman et al, 1998). These therapies are now entering clinical trials. However, the successful introduction of these therapies into clinical practice will require the development of reliable ways to assess angiogenesis and its modification or inhibition in vivo.

Videorecordings of the examination were reanalyzed using a computer image analysis system and software. The appearance of vascular markings was assessed and separately scored for the areas of surface synovium (capsular, CVM), villous proliferation (villous, VVM), and synovium adherent to cartilage (pannus, PVM). Indices of systemic (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR) and local KJS disease activity (clinical index) were obtained before arthroscopy. The morphology and scores of the distinct VM were compared between PsA and RA groups, as was the relationship between respective VM scores and ESR and KJS clinical indices.\nDistinctive VM features were observed for PsA and RA KJS in each separate synovial architecture examined. VVM and CVM scores were significantly correlated with each other in PsA knees, and were significantly higher in PsA compared with RA. In both diseases, VVM and CVM scores were not related to KJS duration or activity or to ESR values, but in RA they were directly correlated with KJS activity. Moreover, the VVM capillary feature \"meandering with tight convolutions,\" considered unique to psoriatic skin, was observed in the synovium of 13 PsA (65%) and one RA KJS (5.5%). The mean KJS duration of the PsA group with typical VVM was significantly lower than the group without VVM (2.6 +/- 1.77 vs 9.4 +/- 8.28 yrs).\nOur macroscopic observations of distinct changes in VM expression in selected anatomical areas of PsA and RA KJS suggest possible pathogenetic differences between the 2 diseases. The typical morphology and higher intensity of villous vascularization, in both early and chronic disease, and the different clinical relevance of VVM scores in PsA compared with RA KJS support the potential use of vascular markings as reliable outcome measures of the PsA process in KJS.", "journal": "The Journal of rheumatology", "date": "2001-11-16", "authors": ["UFiocco", "LCozzi", "FChieco-Bianchi", "CRigon", "MVezz\u00f9", "EFavero", "FFerro", "PSfriso", "LRubaltelli", "RNardacchione", "STodesco"], "doi": null}

Autologous cultured epithelial cells can restore damaged corneas, but this technology is still developing. We sought to establish a culture system that allows preservation of limbal stem cells and preparation of manageable epithelial sheets and to investigate whether such cultures can permanently restore total limbal stem cell deficiency.\nWe selected a homogeneous group of patients whose limbal cell deficiency was evaluated by scoring the gravity of the clinical picture and the keratin expression pattern. Stem cells, obtained from the limbus of the contralateral eye, were cultivated onto a fibrin substrate and their preservation was evaluated by clonal analysis. Fibrin cultures were grafted onto damaged corneas.\nFibrin-cultured limbal stem cells were successful in 14 of 18 patients. Re-epithelialization occurred within the first week. Inflammation and vascularization regressed within the first 3-4 weeks. By the first month, the corneal surface was covered by a transparent, normal-looking epithelium. At 12-27 months follow-up, corneal surfaces were clinically and cytologically stable. Three patients had a penetrating keratoplasty approximately 1 year after restoration of their corneal surface. Their visual acuity improved from light perception or counting fingers to 0.8-1.0.\nPreservation of limbal stem cells in culture gives new perspectives on the treatment of ocular disorders characterized by complete limbal stem cell deficiency.

{"title": "The role of HER2 in angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Recent studies have established that growth factors and their receptors play an essential role in regulating the proliferation of epithelial cells. Abnormalities in the expression, structure, or activity of their proto-oncogene products contribute to the development and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. For example, c-erbB2 encodes the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is overexpressed or amplified or both in several human malignancies including breast, ovarian, and colon cancers. Tumor cells must use the process of vascularization (angiogenesis) for productive growth and metastasis. Overexpression of HER2 in human tumor cells is closely associated with increased angiogenesis and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Indeed, when the VEGF pathway is inhibited, tumor growth is suppressed. The anti-HER2 blocking antibody trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and VEGF expression. Cancer cell invasiveness can be promoted, even in the absence of HER2 overexpression, by transregulation of HER2 by heregulins that bind to HER3 and HER4. Accordingly, heregulin beta1 regulates the expression and secretion of VEGF in breast cancer cells, and trastuzumab inhibits heregulin-mediated angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, potential upregulation of VEGF in cancer epithelial cells likely supports angiogenesis, sustaining and promoting survival and metastasis of tumor cells.", "journal": "Seminars in oncology", "date": "2001-11-14", "authors": ["RKumar", "RYarmand-Bagheri"], "doi": "10.1016/s0093-7754(01)90279-9"}

Therefore, CA9 expression may show hypoxia levels of clinical importance.\nWe assessed the expression of CA9 and the microvessel density (MVD; CD31-positive) in 75 locally advanced squamous cell head and neck cancers treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin.\nStrong membrane/cytoplasmic CA9 expression, noted in 20/75 (26.6%) tumors, mainly occurred in tumors with very poor vascularization (expression in 63% versus 14%; P < 0.0001), was located around areas of focal necrosis, and was related to poor complete response rate (40% versus 70%; P = 0.02).

We have studied the production of proangiogenic (VEGF, FGF-2, PIGF and PDGF) and antiangiogenic (TSP-1) factors in two p73 overexpressing clones obtained from the human ovarian carcinoma cells A2780. TSP-1 was downregulated in both clones compared to mock transfected cells, both at mRNA and protein level. Conversely, both clones showed an increased production of VEGF mRNA and protein. For both TSP-1 and VEGF, regulation of expression was partially due to modulation of the promoter activity, and was dependent on p53 status. Production of the other angiogenic factors FGF-2, PIGF and PDGF-B was also increased in p73 overexpressing clones. The two clones were more angiogenic than parental cells, as shown in vitro by their increased chemotactic activity for endothelial cells, and in vivo by the generation of more vascularized tumors.

{"title": "Platelet glycoprotein gene polymorphisms and risk of thrombosis: facts and fancies.", "abstract": "Over the past several years, platelet glycoprotein gene polymorphisms have received increasing attention as possible inherited determinants of prothrombotic tendency. However, their role in genetic susceptibility to thrombotic disease remains controversial. The glycoprotein IIIa Leu33Pro amino acid substitution appears to be associated with a subtle effect on platelet thrombogenicity in vitro, but is not a major risk factor for arterial thrombotic disease among the general population. Evidence suggests that the glycoprotein IIIa Pro33 allele may be associated with increased risk of thrombotic events following coronary re-vascularization and possibly among younger subjects with atherosclerosis. The nucleotide 807T variant of glycoprotein Ia is associated with increased platelet glycoprotein Ia/IIa receptor density, collagen-induced platelet adhesion and an increased risk of early onset myocardial infarction and stroke. Evaluation of the roles of the glycoprotein Ibalpha Thr145Met and variable number of tandem repeat polymorphisms has been complicated by their lack of well-defined effects on platelet adhesive function and the strong linkage disequilibrium between the two sites. Future epidemiologic studies of platelet glycoprotein gene polymorphisms will require larger sample sizes and family based approaches to further elucidate clinically important associations with thrombotic disease, including gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Other polymorphisms of potential functional significance within genes encoding platelet membrane proteins will undoubtedly be discovered.

Vascularized grafts have higher success rates for union and can better overcome a poor fusion bed than nonvascular grafts. However, they are associated with higher donor site morbidity and greater technical difficulty.\nThree patients with complex medical histories portending a difficult spinal fusion were treated with anterior arthrodesis using vascularized fibular autografts.

Patients reported decreased pain and resumption to previous activities at 24 months follow-up. There were no complications.\nA vascularized fibular graft is a useful alternative to standard grafts for spinal arthrodesis.

{"title": "HLA-G inhibits rolling adhesion of activated human NK cells on porcine endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Human NK cells adhere to and lyse porcine endothelial cells (pEC) and therefore may contribute to the cell-mediated rejection of vascularized pig-to-human xenografts. Since MHC class I molecules inhibit the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, the expression of HLA genes in pEC has been proposed as a potential solution to overcome NK cell-mediated xenogeneic cytotoxicity. HLA-G, a minimally polymorphic HLA class I molecule that can inhibit a wide range of NK cells, is an especially attractive candidate for this purpose. In this study we tested whether the expression of HLA-G on pEC inhibits the molecular mechanisms that lead to adhesion of human NK cells to pEC and subsequent xenogeneic NK cytotoxicity. To this end two immortalized pEC lines (2A2 and PED) were stably transfected with HLA-G1. Rolling adhesion of activated human NK cells to pEC monolayers and xenogeneic cytotoxicity against pEC mediated by polyclonal human NK lines as well as NK clones were inhibited by the expression of HLA-G. The adhesion was partially reversed by masking HLA-G on pEC with anti-HLA mAbs or by masking the HLA-G-specific inhibitory receptor ILT-2 on NK cells with the mAb HP-F1. The inhibition of NK cytotoxicity by HLA-G was only partially mediated by ILT-2, indicating a role for other unknown NK receptors. In conclusion, transgenic expression of HLA-G may be useful to prevent human NK cell responses to porcine xenografts, but is probably not sufficient on its own.

We initiated local granulation tissue formation either by implanting small surgical sponges to elicit a foreign body granulation tissue response, or by ligating the left common carotid to form an organized thrombus. We found that the absence of hematopoietic PDGF B-chain did not decrease the extent of granulation tissue or vascular lesion formation, and that the vascularization of both lesions increased by approximately 100%. We conclude that PDGF B-chain from cells of hematopoietic origin, including platelets and macrophages, is not important for granulation tissue formation, and that it reduces vascularization of granulation issue, probably through disabling of the short-range chemotactic gradients of PDGF that are important for recruiting pericytes/smooth muscle cells to the endothelium of new vessels.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2001-11-07", "authors": ["B SBuetow", "J RCrosby", "W EKaminski", "R KRamachandran", "PLindahl", "PMartin", "CBetsholtz", "R ASeifert", "E WRaines", "D FBowen-Pope"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63033-7"}

Among these lesions which may be benign and malignant, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) finds its place with an incidence in cirrhotic patients becoming higher as the time passes from the onset of cirrhosis. US is of fundamental importance in the regular screening of subjects with viral cirrhosis because of its sensitivity in evaluating focal lesions (79-82%); however, it is not yet the most valuable method for the diagnosis of HCC for which other diagnostic techniques are needed such as CT (Computerized Tomography), MR (Magnetic Resonance) and the US-guided fine-needle biopsy. In fact, the echo-structure of HCC varies with its dimensions and may mimic that of one of many other liver focal lesions. Lately, some new sonographic techniques have become available that can allow a more accurate investigation of HCC. Among them, the \"Tissue Harmonic\" and the \"Pulse Inversion Imaging\" techniques provide a better definition of the grey-scale image thus improving the conspicuity of focal lesions. Color and Power Doppler techniques, while allowing an accurate observation of the lesion vascularization, integrate the sonographic appearance of HCC. The enhancement of the US color Doppler signal obtainable by using echographic contrast agents, represents a further progress for a detailed observation of the focal lesions' micro-vascularization and, thus, for the HCC identification. Further advancements in terms of improvement of the image quality and characterization of the focal lesion are to be expected from the use of \"Tissue Harmonic\" and \"Pulse Inversion Imaging\" techniques associated with echographic contrast agents.

In this study we have shown that, until the sacrifice at 27. day after tumor inoculation in the right hemisphere, MPA had a slight though insignificant activity to reduce the fatality of C6 glioma, growing in right cerebral hemisphere of male Wistar rats. But ibuprofen both alone or with MPA had no effect on survival with gavage application of a 30 mg/kg/day dosing regime. On histological analysis, intra- and peritumoral vessels were counted. Progesterone seemed to lower intratumoral, but to increase peritumoral vessels, especially glomeruloids, around the tumor mass. Coadministration of ibuprofen acted to suppress the peritumoral vessel increase, and to enhance lymphomonocytic infiltration around tumor vessels.", "journal": "Pathology oncology research : POR", "date": "2001-11-03", "authors": ["M AAltinoz", "EOzar", "MTaskin", "EBozcali", "ABilir", "TAltug", "AAydiner", "ASav"], "doi": "10.1007/BF03032347"}
{"title": "Expression of hypoxia-inducible carbonic anhydrase-9 relates to angiogenic pathways and independently to poor outcome in non-small cell lung cancer.", "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA9), a transmembrane enzyme with an extracellular active site, is involved in the reversible metabolism of the carbon dioxide to carbonic acid. Up-regulation of CA by hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway has been recently postulated (Wykoff et al. Cancer Res., 60: 7075-7083, 2000). In the present study we examined the expression of this enzyme in non-small cell lung cancer. Of 107 cases analyzed, 39 (36.4%) had strong membrane/cytoplasmic expression of CA9 and were grouped as positive. The staining was confined around areas of necrosis, and a significant association of CA9 expression with the extent of necrosis was noted (P = 0.004). Nevertheless, 38 of 74 cases with focal or extensive necrosis did not express CA9. CA9 expression was more frequent in the squamous cell histology (P = 0.001) and with advanced T stage (P = 0.009). A significant coexpression of CA9 with platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor receptor expression was noted. Double staining of CA9 with anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody revealed an overall higher microvessel density in the areas expressing CA9 than in negative areas (P = 0.0005). Thirty-one of 38 CA9-positive cases were positive for HIF1a/HIF2a, but HIF positivity was a more common event (68 of 107) and their patterns of expression were diffuse (not confined in the necrotic areas). A direct association of CA9 expression with epidermal growth factor receptor, c-erbB-2, and MUC1 expression was also noted (P < 0.04). Survival analysis showed that CA9 expression is related to poor prognosis. CA9 expression in tumors with low vascularization defined a prognosis similar to the one of patients with highly angiogenic tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that CA9 expression is a significant prognostic factor independent of angiogenesis. We conclude that CA9 is an important molecule in non-small cell lung cancer, the up-regulation of which occurs in highly hypoxic/necrotic regions of the tumors. The expression of CA9 is linked to the expression of a constellation of proteins involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis inhibition, and cell-cell adhesion disruption, which explains the strong association of CA9 with poor outcome.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2001-11-03", "authors": ["AGiatromanolaki", "M IKoukourakis", "ESivridis", "JPastorek", "C CWykoff", "K CGatter", "A LHarris"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Polymeric system for dual growth factor delivery.", "abstract": "The development of tissues and organs is typically driven by the action of a number of growth factors. However, efforts to regenerate tissues (e.g., bone, blood vessels) typically rely on the delivery of single factors, and this may partially explain the limited clinical utility of many current approaches. One constraint on delivering appropriate combinations of factors is a lack of delivery vehicles that allow for a localized and controlled delivery of more than a single factor. We report a new polymeric system that allows for the tissue-specific delivery of two or more growth factors, with controlled dose and rate of delivery. The utility of this system was investigated in the context of therapeutic angiogenesis. We now demonstrate that dual delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, each with distinct kinetics, from a single, structural polymer scaffold results in the rapid formation of a mature vascular network. This is the first report of a vehicle capable of delivery of multiple angiogenic factors with distinct kinetics, and these results clearly indicate the importance of multiple growth factor action in tissue regeneration and engineering.", "journal": "Nature biotechnology", "date": "2001-11-02", "authors": ["T PRichardson", "M CPeters", "A BEnnett", "D JMooney"], "doi": "10.1038/nbt1101-1029"}

The efficiency of SFV-mediated gene delivery was first evaluated for B 16 cells and compared with the efficiency in cells of endothelial origin (HMVECs). HMVECs are more susceptible to SFV infection than B 16 cells. For the in vivo treatment model, phosphate-buffered saline, SFV-LacZ, retrovirus vector GCsap-Endostatin, and SFV-Endostatin were injected to mice bearing B 16 brain tumors. A very significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in the group that had been treated with SFV-Endostatin. A marked reduction of intratumoral vascularization was seen in the tumor sections from the SFV-Endostatin group compared with tumor sections from the SFV-LacZ or GCsap-Endostatin groups. Moreover, at day 7 after intravenous administration of SFV-Endostatin, the serum level of endostatin was augmented more than 3-fold compared to that after intravenous administration of GCsap-Endostatin.

{"title": "Angiostatin enhances B7.1-mediated cancer immunotherapy independently of effects on vascular endothelial growth factor expression.", "abstract": "Tumors must develop an adequate vascular network to meet their increasing demands for nutrition and oxygen. Angiostatin, a multiple kringle (1-4)-containing fragment of plasminogen, is an effective natural inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis. Here we show that gene transfer of angiostatin into small (0.1 cm in diameter) solid EL-4 lymphomas established in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice led to reduced tumor angiogenesis and weak inhibition of tumor growth. In contrast, when angiostatin gene therapy was preceded by in situ gene transfer of the T-cell costimulator B7.1, large (0.4 cm in diameter) tumors were rapidly and completely eradicated, whereas B7.1 and angiostatin monotherapies were ineffective. Combined gene transfer of B7.1 and angiostatin generated potent systemic antitumor immunity that was effective in eradicating a systemic challenge of 10(7) EL-4 cells. Gene transfer of angiostatin expression plasmids led to overexpression of angiostatin in tumors, increased apoptosis of tumor cells, and decreased density of tumor blood vessels, which may allow the immune system to overcome tumor immune resistance. The latter effects were not the result of a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor expression, as tumoral vascular endothelial growth factor expression increased slightly after angiostatin gene transfer, presumably in response to increasing hypoxia. These results suggest that combining immunogene therapy with a vascular attack by angiostatin is a particularly effective approach for eliciting antitumor immunity.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2001-11-01", "authors": ["XSun", "J RKanwar", "ELeung", "KLehnert", "DWang", "G WKrissansen"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700370"}

Mechanisms of metalloprotease action underlying these events include the proteolytic cleavage of growth factors so that they can become available to cells not in direct physical contact, degradation of the ECM so that founder cells can move across tissues into nearby stroma, and regulated receptor cleavage to terminate migratory signaling. Most of these processes require a delicate balance between the functions of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) or metalloprotease-disintegrins (ADAMs) and natural tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs).

Each monoclonal antibody consistently detected the expression of VEGF in different cell types. The R&D Systems antibody only produced surface staining of endothelial cells in tumour capillaries, whereas staining with the Neomarkers antibody was largely confined to tumour cell cytoplasm.

Production of this plasminogen fragment in a cell-free system has allowed characterization of the structure and activity of the protein. p22 consists of amino acid residues 78-180 of plasminogen and therefore embodies the first plasminogen kringle (residues 84-162) as well as additional N- and C-terminal residues. Circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectrum analysis have defined structural differences between p22 and recombinant plasminogen kringle 1 (rK1), therefore suggesting a unique conformation for kringle 1 within p22. Proliferation of capillary endothelial cells but not cells of other lineages was selectively inhibited by p22 in vitro. In addition, p22 prevented vascular growth of chick chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) in vivo.

The hypothesis of this study is that the hypoxic drive of angiogenesis might be minimal or absent in those growing liver metastases which are capable of preserving the stromal structure, including the numerous sinusoidal blood vessels. Representative paraffin sections of liver metastases from 26 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma were investigated. Three different growth patterns were found. In the desmoplastic and in the pushing growth patterns (42% and 46% of all metastases, respectively), the architecture of the liver parenchyma was not preserved. In the replacement growth pattern (12% of all cases), the reticulin pattern of the liver parenchyma was conserved within the metastases at the tumour-liver parenchyma interface. The endothelial cells of the blood vessels near the interface in the metastases of the replacement type did not express CD34, nor were they surrounded by alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive mural cells. In the desmoplastic and in the pushing growth patterns, 23% and 52% of all blood vessels in this area were covered by pericytes. The fraction of proliferating endothelial cells was low in the metastases with a desmoplastic or a replacement growth pattern (about 3%), compared with metastases with a pushing growth pattern (11%). Tumour cell apoptosis was highest in the pushing-type metastases and was inversely correlated with microvessel density in liver metastases. The ratio of the proliferating tumour cell fraction and the proliferating endothelial cell fraction, roughly representing the degree of angiogenesis-dependent growth, was three- to four-fold higher in the replacement-type metastases compared with the other metastases. In summary, the present study has demonstrated that liver metastases are a heterogeneous group, with different growth patterns which predict the fraction of immature blood vessels, the fraction of proliferating endothelial cells, and the fraction of apoptotic tumour cells.

This latter event is associated with a mid-gestational brain hemorrhage when Id dosage is sufficiently low. Partial reduction in Id levels spares the endothelium in the brain but adults born fail to support the vascularization of tumors.

This form of neovascular ARMD, termed retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) in this article, can be confused with CNV.\nThe purpose of this article is 1) to review the clinical and angiographic characteristics of a series of patients with RAP and 2) to propose a theoretical sequence of events that accounts for the neovascularized process.\nIn this retrospective clinical and angiographic analysis, 143 eyes with RAP (108 patients) were reviewed and classified based on their vasogenic nature and course. Clinical biomicroscopic examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography were used to evaluate patients.\nThe results of this series suggest that angiomatous proliferation within the retina is the first manifestation of the vasogenic process in this form of neovascular ARMD. Dilated retinal vessels and pre-, intra-, and subretinal hemorrhages and exudate evolve, surrounding the angiomatous proliferation as the process extends into the deep retina and subretinal space. One or more dilated compensatory retinal vessels perfuse and drain the neovascularization, sometimes forming a retinal-retinal anastomosis. Fluorescein angiography in these patients usually revealed indistinct staining simulating occult CNV. Indocyanine green angiography was useful to make an accurate diagnosis in most cases. It revealed a focal area of intense hyperfluorescence corresponding to the neovascularization (\"hot spot\") and other characteristic findings. Based on understanding of the nature and progression of the neovascularized process, patients with RAP were classified into three vasogenic stages. Stage I involved proliferation of intraretinal capillaries originating from the deep retinal complex (intraretinal neovascularization [IRN]). Stage II was determined by growth of the retinal vessels into the subretinal space (subretinal neovascularization [SRN]). Stage III occurred when CNV could clearly be determined clinically or angiographically. A vascularized pigment epithelial detachment and RCA were inconsistent features of this stage.\nRetinal angiomatous proliferation appears to be a distinct subgroup of neovascular ARMD. It may present in one of three vasogenic stages: IRN, SRN, or CNV. Whereas ICG angiography is helpful in diagnosing RAP and in documenting the stage of the neovascularized process, it is frequently difficult to determine the precise nature and location of the new vessel formation. It is important for clinicians to recognize the vasogenic potential and the associated manifestations of this peculiar form of neovascular ARMD so that a proper diagnosis can be made, and when possible, an appropriate management administered.", "journal": "Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "date": "2001-10-20", "authors": ["L AYannuzzi", "SNegr\u00e3o", "TIida", "CCarvalho", "HRodriguez-Coleman", "JSlakter", "K BFreund", "JSorenson", "DOrlock", "NBorodoker"], "doi": "10.1097/00006982-200110000-00003"}

Limb allografts comprise different types of tissues with varying antigenicities, and the immunosuppressive doses required for these allografts are as high or higher than those required for solid organ allotransplantation. In particular, bone marrow is an early target of the host immune response. This study reports on donor limb modification of the marrow compartment leading to prolonged survival of limb allografts. Chimeric limb allografts comprising a Lewis rat vascularized allograft and Brown Norway rat bone marrow were created. These chimeric limbs were transplanted into three recipients: (1) Buffalo rats (n = 12), where the chimeric limb was allogeneic for both vascular graft and bone marrow; (2) Lewis rats (n = 12), where the limb was allogeneic for marrow alone; and (3) Brown Norway rats (n = 12), where the limb was allogeneic for graft alone. This study found that Brown Norway recipients elicited significantly reduced cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in comparison with the Buffalo and Lewis recipients (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The Buffalo and Lewis recipients both elicited high cell-mediated and humoral responses.

{"title": "The outcome of failed free flaps in head and neck and extremity reconstruction: what is next in the reconstructive ladder?", "abstract": "The indications for free flaps have been more or less clarified; however, the course of reconstruction after the failure of a free flap remains undetermined. Is it better to insist on one's initial choice, or should surgeons downgrade their reconstructive goals? To establish a preliminary guideline, this study was designed to retrospectively analyze the outcome of failed free-tissue transfers performed in the authors hospital. Over the past 8 years (1990 through 1997), 3361 head and neck and extremity reconstructions were performed by free-tissue transfers, excluding toe transplantations. Among these reconstructions, 1235 flaps (36.7 percent) were transferred to the head and neck region, and 2126 flaps (63.3 percent) to the extremities. A total of 101 failures (3.0 percent total plus the partial failure rate) were encountered. Forty-two failures occurred in the head and neck region, and 59 in the extremities. Evaluation of the cases revealed that one of three following approaches to handling the failure was taken: (1) a second free-tissue transfer; (2) a regional flap transfer; or (3) conservative management with debridement, wound care, and subsequent closure by secondary intention, whether by local flaps or skin grafting. In the head and neck region, 17 second free flaps (40 percent) and 15 regional flaps (36 percent) were transferred to salvage the reconstruction, whereas conservative management was undertaken in the remaining 10 cases (24 percent). In the extremities, 37 failures were treated conservatively (63 percent) in addition to 17 second free flaps (29 percent) and three regional flaps (5 percent) used to salvage the failed reconstruction. Two cases underwent amputation (3 percent). The average time elapsed between the failure and second free-tissue transfer was 12 days (range, 2 to 60 days) in the head and neck region and 18 days (range, 2 to 56 days) in the extremities. In a total of 34 second free-tissue transfers at both localizations, there were only three failures (9 percent). However, in the head and neck region, seven of the regional flaps transferred (47 percent) and four cases that were conservatively treated (40 percent) either failed or developed complications that lengthened the reconstruction period because of additional procedures. Six other free-tissue transfers had to be performed to manage these complicated cases. Conservative management was quite successful in the extremities; most patients' wounds healed, although more than one skin-graft procedure was required in 10 patients (27 percent). In conclusion, a second free-tissue transfer is, in general, a relatively more reliable and more effective procedure for the treatment of flap failure in the head and neck region, as well as failed vascularized bone flaps in the reconstruction of the extremities. Conservative treatment may be a simple and valid alternative to second (free) flaps for soft-tissue coverage in extremities with partial and even total losses.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2001-10-18", "authors": ["F CWei", "FDemirkan", "H CChen", "D CChuang", "S HChen", "C HLin", "S LCheng", "M HCheng", "Y TLin"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200110000-00007"}

A technique for distal anastomosis in a a small caliber artery].", "abstract": "CRITICAL ISCHEMIA OF THE LOWER LIMBS: This type of lesion, which spontaneously progresses to gangrene and amputation, is encountered more and more frequently. Emergency endoluminal revascularization or bypass surgery is required. When conventional endoluminal techniques cannot be used, a distal graft using the autologous saphenous vein is a promising alternative to achieve patent vascularization and salvage the limb.\nUsable venous material is not always available due to varicosities, thrombus formation, small size or previous surgery (stripping, coronary surgery, prior revascularization procedure); rates reported range from 20 to 40%. For such patients, other veins (external saphenous, arm veins, superficial femoral veins) may be useful but are not always appropriate for distal repair. Different prostheses might also be used but again do not always provide improved permeability. Most teams however use a polytetrafluoroethylene stent for revascularization of the distal leg. Different technical improvements favor success of prosthetic bypasses, but when used below the knee, flow remains less satisfactory than with venous bypasses.\nThis procedure is a common adjuvant technique positioning a venous cuff between the recipient artery and the prosthesis. The cuff avoids the direct contact between the prosthesis and the fragile artery that is often difficult to suture.\nSeveral series have demonstrated that the rate of success of vein cuff procedures remains lower than venous bypass procedures, but also that flow is better than with simple femorotibial prostheses.\nThe reduction of the neo-intimal hyperplasia observed in experimental models is insufficient to explain entirely the observed in vivo benefit. The fact that the suture is easier to make is one possible reason. Indeed the rate of failure of simple prosthetic bypass surgery is high in the immediate postoperative period. These cases of thrombosis result from technical insufficiencies and are undoubtedly overcome by the use of the venous cuff.", "journal": "Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)", "date": "2001-10-18", "authors": ["CSaliou", "YCastier", "PSoury", "SFukui", "FAngel", "FGigou", "CLaurian"], "doi": null}

After resection of large articular segments adjacent to the dia- or metaphysis of long bones modular endoprosthetic devices are most commonly used for reconstruction. In case non-vascularized corticocancellous bone is transplanted in order to bridge extensive bone defects, the risk of pseudarthrosis and fracture of the donor bone is significantly higher in comparison to a free vascularized transplant. From 1988 until 1999 we treated 20 patients with extensive bone defects after resection of tumors affecting the upper and lower extremity using a vascularized fibular graft. In this retrospective analysis we collected the data focusing on bone integration and functional outcome. The graft union was classified according to the standards of the \"International Symposium of Limb Salvage\". Evaluation of the functional outcome was quantified using the Enneking-score. The stabilisation of the transplant was obtained exclusively by plate fixation in the upper extremity. In 10 in a total of 12 patients the reconstruction using a vascularized fibula transfer was reinforced with an allograft in the lower extremity.

Other complicating factors include exposed dura and spinal implants. Introducing well-vascularized soft tissue to obliterate dead space is critical to reliable wound healing. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of the trapezius turnover flap in the management of these complex wounds. This study is a retrospective review of all patients undergoing trapezius muscle turnover flaps for closure of complex cervicothoracic wounds after spinal operations for metastatic or primary tumors. Six patients (3 male/3 female) were operated over an 18-month period (mean patient age, 43 years). Primary pathologies included radiation-induced peripheral nerve sheath tumor (N = 2), chondrosarcoma (N = 1), nonsmall-cell lung cancer (N = 1), paraganglioma (N = 1), and spindle cell sarcoma (N = 1). Trapezius muscle turnover flaps were unilateral and based on the transverse cervical artery in every patient. Indication for flap closure included inability to perform primary layered closure (N = 3), open wound with infection (N = 2), and exposed hardware (N = 1). All patients had previous operations of the cervicothoracic spine (mean, 5.8 months; range 2-9 months) for malignant disease and prior radiation therapy. Exposed dura was present in all patients, and 2 patients had dural repairs with bovine pericardial patches. Spinal stabilization hardware was present in 4 patients. All patients underwent perioperative treatment with systemic corticosteroids. All flaps survived, and primary wound healing was achieved in each patient. The only wound complication was a malignant pleural effusion communicating with the back wound, which was controlled with a closed suction drain. All wounds remained healed during the follow-up period. Four patients died from progression of disease within 10 months of surgery. The trapezius turnover flap has been used successfully when local tissue conditions prevent primary closure, or in the setting of open, infected wounds with exposed dura and hardware.

Reconstruction of 3500 histological serial sections demonstrated that a new vascular network composed of venous-venous loops of varying sizes grows inside the tumor from the wall of the adjacent main vein. Loops elongate and remodel to establish complex loop systems. The mechanisms of loop formation and remodeling correspond to intussusceptive microvascular growth (IMG). In the tissue surrounding the tumor segmentation, another mechanism of IMG is prevalent in venous vessels. Comparison to vascular morphogenesis in the ovariectomized pedicle not only confirms the existence of corresponding mechanisms in both systems, but also reveals numerous sprouts that are superimposed onto loop systems and pathological deviations of loop formation, remodeling, and segmentation in the tumor.

Loop formation is followed by elongation. Loop remodeling occurs also by intussusception and results in the formation of compound loop systems. All loop systems observed were completely patent. Blind-ending sprouts were extremely rare. Anastomoses between the preexisting vessels subjected to segmentation and the loop systems were established to include the newly formed vessels into the preexisting vascular network.

The systolic and diastolic peak velocities, the end-diastolic velocity, and the pulsatility index and resistance index were calculated for quantitative analysis of the Doppler waveforms. Intraovarian perfusion increased gradually during pro-oestrus. A marked enhancement of intraovarian colouring and blood flow velocities, and a decline in the indices for pulsatility and resistance were observed in the preovulatory period.

The suspended tumor cells rapidly formed solid tumors which invaded the CAM and were vascularized by CAM vessels. When grown on the CAM of quail embryos intratumoral endothelial cells could be specifically stained with the QH1 antibody. In C6 gliomas the vascular pattern was more regular than in 10AS carcinomas.

{"title": "Endocrine and paracrine regulation of endometrial angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The human endometrium is a complex tissue comprised of different cell types, including epithelial, stromal, inflammatory, perivascular, and blood vessel cells. The hormonal receptivity and distribution of these cell populations change during the menstrual cycle. Cyclical endometrial growth is dependent on its ability to regenerate a vascular capillary network, which grows in parallel with the proliferation and differentiation of the endometrial lining. Natural hormonal effects on the endometrium and endocrine manipulation of this tissue, in response to the use of exogenous steroid therapies, can affect endometrial capillary proliferation and function, leading to clinical abnormalities of uterine bleeding. We propose that the regulation of endometrial angiogenesis is mediated indirectly via complex interactions among cell types. Our laboratory has focused on a prototypical member of the angiogenic proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. In this paper we present data demonstrating that VEGF-A expression in normal endometrial epithelial and stromal cells and in Ishikawa adenocarcinoma cells is increased by an ovarian steroid, estradiol. Infiltrating immune cells, particularly polymorphonuclear granulocytes, also are sources of VEGF-A. In inflammatory conditions involving the endometrium (e.g., endometriosis), a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1beta, can mediate neoangiogenesis by inducing VEGF-A gene transcription.

Stem cells are important for corneal epithelial regeneration and wound healing.

Limbal deficiency is characterized by conjunctivalization of the cornea with vascularization and opacification. Partial limbal deficiency can be treated by removing ingrown conjunctival epithelium thus allowing normal limbal epithelium to repopulate the cornea. Unilateral limbus-derived stem cell disease requires either limbal autograft transplantation from the healthy partner eye or kerato-limbal allograft transplantation.

Developments at the beginning of a new century].", "abstract": "Gastrointestinal segments are currently by far the most popular method to create a bladder substitute. Attempts have been made to further reduce the morbidity and burden for patients by using minimal invasive techniques for both cystectomy and urinary diversion. However, laparoscopy for acceptable forms of urinary diversion is time consuming and costly. A neobladder \"off the shelf\" would be a better solution. Tissue engineering is an exciting new field which enables the cultivation and expansion of individual bladder cells obtained by transurethral biopsy, the attachment of these cells to a support matrix, and their reimplantation into the body. Advances both in biomaterials as well as in the cultivation and expansion of bladder cells are described. Promising routine clinical applications of tissue engineering may still need several years. Free neurovascular muscle transfer to the bladder demonstrated both experimentally and clinically to be a suitable treatment modality in patients with bladder acontractility. This may therefore be the next logical step towards an improved bladder substitute by combining well vascularized flaps with urothelial cell seeding. Thus a combination of commonly used flap techniques and tissue engineering may soon be possible.", "journal": "Der Urologe. Ausg.

The SCID mice were first injected s.c. with a human prostatic tumor line, forming a skin tumor that produces a high blood titer of prostate-specific antigen and metastasizes to bone. The icon was encoded in a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector that was injected directly into the skin tumor. The tumor cells infected by the vector synthesize and secrete the icon into the blood, and the blood-borne icon binds with high affinity and specificity to mouse tissue factor expressed on endothelial cells lining the lumen of the tumor vasculature and to human tissue factor expressed on the tumor cells. The Fc domain of the icon activates a cytolytic immune attack against cells that bind the icon. The immunotherapy tests in SCID mice demonstrated that intratumoral injections of the adenoviral vector encoding the mfVII/human Fc icon resulted in long-term regression of the injected human prostatic tumor and also of a distant uninjected tumor, without associated toxicity to the mice. Comparable results were obtained with a SCID mouse model of human melanoma. At the end of the experiments the mice appeared to be free of viable tumor cells.

After nasopharyngectomy, resurfacing the nasopharynx and covering the internal carotid artery is important to minimize the risk of infection, osteoradionecrosis, and carotid rupture. Previous authors have advocated the use of free grafts of skin and mucosa for this purpose but have also described significant rates of partial and total graft failure.\nWe believe that the best and most reliable way to resurface the nasopharynx is with vascularized tissue, and our preference is for the use of a free radial forearm flap. To illustrate our approach, we present two patients who underwent nasopharyngectomy by means of a maxillary swing approach and who had resurfacing of the surgical defect with a free radial forearm flap.\nBoth patients had complete en bloc resection of tumor followed by the insetting of a free radial forearm flap to reline the surgical defect. Both flaps remained completely viable, and both patients achieved successful resurfacing of the entire nasopharynx. The morbidity of surgery was minimal, and there were no perioperative complications. On assessment 1 year later, the free radial forearm flap continues to reline the entire neonasopharynx, and the long-term functional recovery after surgery is excellent.\nResurfacing the nasopharynx after nasopharyngectomy with a free radial forearm flap aids healing and minimizes the risk of complications.

From a statistical point of view, the susceptibility-induced EV BOLD signal changes for both gradient- and spin-echoes are shown to be proportional to cerebral blood volume (CBV). These changes can be expressed by a function of two nondimensional parameters: one represents the characteristic phase change of the signal induced by the deoxyhemoglobin-containing vessels, and the other represents a diffusion effect relative to the vessel radius. The numerical results showed excellent agreement with the analytical solutions obtained previously for the regimes of small and large diffusion effects. Based on the numerical results for gradient- and spin-echoes, it is possible to show the dependence of the EV BOLD contribution on the echo time, the static magnetic field strength, and the stimulation-induced CBV change. This dependence can be demonstrated for vessels of small, intermediate, and large radii, which correspond respectively to the slow, intermediate, and fast diffusion regimes. A more realistic functional MRI (fMRI) simulation which includes an intravascular (IV) contribution is presented, with emphasis on the field strength dependence of the BOLD signal changes.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2001-10-09", "authors": ["NFujita"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.1251"}

Computed tomography remains the dominant imaging modality in the evaluation of orbital trauma. Helical CT axial scanning with multiplanar reconstruction and three-dimensional CT imaging are most helpful in assessing iatrogenic, traumatogenic, and teratogenic orbital abnormalities. Despite its poor histologic specificity, MR imaging provides superior soft tissue contrast, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging has an established role regarding soft tissue tumor infiltration. The greatest value of MR studies in the evaluation of orbital and palpebral tumors is that it has the capacity to show the precise relation between lesions and adjacent structures before the clinician contemplates a surgical approach.

{"title": "Development of the primate retinal vasculature.", "abstract": "Human and macaque retinae have similar retinal vascular anatomy. The general features of the retinal vascular anatomy of these two primates have much in common with more widely studied animal models such as rat and cat. However, primates are unique amongst mammals in having a region in temporal retina specialized for high visual acuity, which includes the fovea centralis (or 'fovea'). Several features distinguish the fovea from other parts of the retina, including a very high local density of cone photoreceptors, a high density of inner retinal cells during development, and an absence of retinal blood vessels. The retinal vascular complex comprises a number of cell types, in addition to vascular endothelial cells, including pericytes, microglia, astrocytes-none of which is intrinsic to the retina. In addition, amacrine-like cells make bouton-like associations with retinal vessels and may be involved in the autoregulation of blood flow. During development endothelial cells 'invade' the retina, accompanied by a population of microglial cells; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes are also seen associated with the developing vasculature, and are in advance of the vascular front by a few hundred microns. Recent findings indicate that astrocytes at the vascular front proliferate in response to factors released by endothelial cells, including leukemia inhibitory factor. Better understood is the role of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes just in advance of the developing vessels. These astrocytes are sensitive to hypoxia and in response release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which in turn promotes the migration, differentiation and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. This hypoxia/VEGF-mediated process of migration, proliferation and differentiation appears common to the retinae of a variety of species, including human. However, in human and macaque retina, different mechanisms appear to govern the development of the retinal vessels growing along the horizontal meridian of the retina towards the central area, which contains the fovea. Despite the relatively advanced state of differentiation and maturation of cells in the central area compared with the periphery, the growth of retinal vessels into the central area has been described as 'retarded', and the incidence of cell proliferation associated with these vessels is lower than in peripheral vessels. Furthermore, neither retinal vessels nor their accompanying astrocytes grow into a circumscribed region which, at a later stage, develops into the foveal depression. These observations suggest that molecular markers define the foveal region and inhibit cell proliferation and vascular growth at the fovea and, perhaps, along the horizontal meridian. The findings also suggest that at the fovea, the retina is adapted morphologically to its blood supply, since in the vicinity of the fovea, the development of retinal vessels is retarded or inhibited. The limitations on vascularization of central retina has implications for its vulnerability to degenerative changes, as seen in age-related macular degeneration.", "journal": "Progress in retinal and eye research", "date": "2001-10-06", "authors": ["J MProvis"], "doi": "10.1016/s1350-9462(01)00012-x"}

We enrolled 2161 spherical soft contact lens-wearing patients. High ametropes were defined as those with at least +/- 5.00 D spherical equivalent refractive error in the right eye. Data on current contact lenses, prescribed care regimens, and slit lamp biomicroscopic signs were provided by the eye care practitioners, and information on actual lens care behaviors and attitudes toward contact lens wear were gathered by survey directly from the patients. All differences between high and low ametropes were compared using the chi-square test.\nCompared with low ametropes, high ametropes were more satisfied with their vision with contact lenses (p < 0.001). More high ametropes wore their lenses on an extended-wear schedule (p = 0.015). Both groups of patients reported a similar degree of lens awareness and lens-associated pain, but fewer high ametropes reported foreign body sensation (p = 0.002). In managing contact lens discomfort, high ametropes were more likely to use an old spare lens (p = 0.01) and more likely to continue wearing their lenses (p = 0.016)--indicators of a propensity for self-management. In response to a damaged lens, high ametropes were less likely to remove both of their lenses (p = 0.002). High ametropes showed more conjunctival staining (p = 0.001) and more corneal scars (p = 0.033). High ametropes also presented with more corneal fluorescein staining (p = 0.001) and more corneal vascularization (p < 0.001). These relations between the degree of ametropia and slit lamp signs of contact lens wear were not significantly affected by daily- vs. extended-wear status.\nIn summary, practitioners should consider the implications of the patient's degree of ametropia when prescribing contact lenses.

Histopathologic examination and ultrastructural examination revealed cellular neoplasms composed of immature adipocytes with relatively well-defined septa, frequent lipoblasts, a fine vascular network, and often a myxoid appearance resembling myxoid liposarcoma. Cytogenetics was performed in 4 cases with chromosome 8q abnormality being most common. The major concern with lipoblastoma in children is to completely excise the tumor to avoid leaving residual tumor and to prevent recurrences. Confusion with myxoid liposarcoma, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and typical lipomas may occur. Although asymptomatic, lipoblastomas may cause dysfunction of other organ systems due to mass effect. Complete surgical excision with at least 2 years of follow-up is the preferred therapy.", "journal": "Ultrastructural pathology", "date": "2001-10-02", "authors": ["JHicks", "ADilley", "DPatel", "JBarrish", "S HZhu", "MBrandt"], "doi": "10.1080/019131201753136359"}

Here, we demonstrate a role for blood vessels as a source of developmental signals during pancreatic organogenesis. In vitro experiments with embryonic mouse tissues demonstrate that blood vessel endothelium induces insulin expression in isolated endoderm. Removal of the dorsal aorta in Xenopus laevis embryos results in the failure of insulin expression in vivo. Furthermore, using transgenic mice, we show that ectopic vascularization in the posterior foregut leads to ectopic insulin expression and islet hyperplasia.

{"title": "Integrins in vascular development.", "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a sustained interest in vascularization processes. Much, if not all, of the work has included the concept of new vessel morphogenesis. Surprisingly, most of the work has not addressed developmental mechanisms directly, but rather as an offshoot of a disease process, wound healing process, or from the perspective of inducing vessels in an ischemic site. One theme has dominated the various studies on capillary or endothelial tube morphogenesis-integrin-mediated cell behavior. Integrin biology impacts virtually every known step of nascent vessel formation. In this review article, we attempted to summarize key findings from the viewpoint of developmental biologists/morphologists. We also attempted to summarize and contrast data obtained using integrin gene ablation approaches in mice with other experimental systems.

{"title": "Ureteroileal anastomosis in orthotopic urinary diversion: how much or how little is necessary?", "abstract": "An increasing number of patients with an orthotopic neobladder and their expanding life expectancy necessitate an effective antireflux protection of the upper urinary tract. During the evolution of urinary diversion in the 20th century, several techniques to perform an ureteroileal anastomosis have been introduced. Those techniques most commonly used for orthotopic neobladders are discussed.\nVascularization of both the ureteral ends and the recipient bowel as well as a meticulous surgical technique are necessary to reduce the reported postoperative stricture rate, which ranges between 3% and 30%. Variations such as preservation of additional periureteral adventitial tissue and its use for coverage of the ureterointestinal suture line are described. High-pressure urinary reflux may lead to mechanical damage of the renal parenchyma, whereas low-pressure occasional reflux in conjunction with chronic bacteriuria will lead to pyelonephritic changes and eventually deterioration of renal function. An intraluminal valve mechanism with increasing efficiency during pouch filling is clearly the most physiological form of antireflux mechanism. Interposition of an afferent ileal limb in addition to the antireflux valve seems advantageous due to the favorable vascularization in the dissected midureter.\nIncreased life expectancy in patients with orthotopic neobladders will increase the number of cases where access to the upper urinary tract becomes necessary due to a benign or malignant disease. Any technique that simultaneously provides an efficient antireflux mechanism and facilitates retrograde manipulation of the ureters (via the pouch) will be greatly appreciated by both patients and treating physicians.", "journal": "Techniques in urology", "date": "2001-09-29", "authors": ["AStenzl", "AHobisch", "HStrasser", "GBartsch"], "doi": null}

We also evaluated the effect of continuous anti-angiogenic treatment with TNP-470 on tumor hemoglobin concentration and tumor vascularity in U87 and MLL tumors. Non-invasive NIRS recordings were performed with a custom-built flash near-infrared spectrometer using light guide-coupled reflectance measurements at 800+/-10 nm. Chalkley counts were obtained from CD31-immunostained cryosections. The NIRS recordings in arbitrary absorbance units increased with tumor size in the individual tumors until a plateau was reached at approximately 150 mm(3). This plateau was relatively tumor line-specific. NIRS recordings at the plateau phase were strongly correlated (P<.001, n=71) to the histological vessel score (Chalkley count) of the same individual tumors excised immediately after the NIRS was performed. Non-invasive NIRS recordings of the highly vascularized gliomas (U87, U118, and U373) plus the MatLyLu tumor line were significantly higher than the three less vascularized SCLC tumor lines (P<.001). Continuous treatment with the anti-angiogenic compound TNP-470, an endothelial cell inhibitor, significantly retarded tumor growth in both U87 and MLL tumors, but all tumors eventually grew. When comparing treated and untreated tumors of similar size, both NIRS recordings and Chalkley counts were significantly lower in TNP-470-treated tumors (P<.05).

Medium follicles were then used as a model to investigate angiogenesis. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for VEGF mRNA demonstrated that granulosa cells represent the main component involved in the production of VEGF. The follicle wall, which presents two distinct concentric vessel networks, showed a vascular area (positive stained area/percent of field area) that was significantly wider in high VEGF follicles than in low VEGF follicles (2.54% +/- 0.58% vs. 1.29% +/- 0.58%, respectively). Medium follicles with high VEGF levels and extensive vascularization accumulated high estradiol levels (150-300 ng/ml), whereas follicles with low VEGF levels had basal estradiol levels that never exceeded 30 ng/ml. Early atretic medium-size follicles had undetectable levels of VEGF and estradiol paralleled by a marked reduction in blood vessel.

Third-party rat and mouse hearts were rejected, though at a slower rate than bone marrow matched naive controls. High levels of antimouse antibodies were detected in rats with rejected hearts. These antibodies were absent in chimeric animals with long-term surviving heart grafts.\nLong-term multilineage bone marrow chimerism can be produced in a mouse --> rat bone marrow transplant model. Long-term survival of donor specific and recipient specific vascularized cardiac grafts can be produced in these chimeric animals. These animals are clinically normal but show signs of subclinical immunosuppression regimen as they reject third-party hearts later than naive animals. Our results suggest that antibodies also play a significant role in concordant xenograft rejection, and induction of bone marrow chimerism can overcome this barrier.", "journal": "The Annals of thoracic surgery", "date": "2001-09-22", "authors": ["M MMohiuddin", "YQin", "XQian", "YMeng", "V JDiSesa"], "doi": "10.1016/s0003-4975(01)02811-9"}
{"title": "Mathematical modeling of capillary formation and development in tumor angiogenesis: penetration into the stroma.", "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present a mathematical model for the tumor vascularization theory of tumor growth proposed by Judah Folkman in the early 1970s and subsequently established experimentally by him and his coworkers [Ausprunk, D. H. and J. Folkman (1977) Migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in performed and newly formed blood vessels during tumor angiogenesis, Microvasc Res., 14, 53-65; Brem, S., B. A. Preis, ScD.

Cancer Inst., 52, 413-419]. In the simplest version of this model, an avascular tumor secretes a tumor growth factor (TGF) which is transported across an extracellular matrix (ECM) to a neighboring vasculature where it stimulates endothelial cells to produce a protease that acts as a catalyst to degrade the fibronectin of the capillary wall and the ECM. The endothelial cells then move up the TGF gradient back to the tumor, proliferating and forming a new capillary network. In the model presented here, we include two mechanisms for the action of angiostatin. In the first mechanism, substantiated experimentally, the angiostatin acts as a protease inhibitor. A second mechanism for the production of protease inhibitor from angiostatin by endothelial cells is proposed to be of Michaelis-Menten type. Mathematically, this mechanism includes the former as a subcase. Our model is different from other attempts to model the process of tumor angiogenesis in that it focuses (1) on the biochemistry of the process at the level of the cell; (2) the movement of the cells is based on the theory of reinforced random walks; (3) standard transport equations for the diffusion of molecular species in porous media. One consequence of our numerical simulations is that we obtain very good computational agreement with the time of the onset of vascularization and the rate of capillary tip growth observed in rabbit cornea experiments [Ausprunk, D.

The subjects underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography using a 4-7 MHz convex broadband transducer. Translabial sagittal scans of the urethra were taken when the subjects had a full bladder, both during the oestrogenic and progestogenic phases. The colour Doppler ultrasonography parameters were optimized to detect slow flows in the anterior and posterior distal, middle and proximal urethra. A rank-sum nonparametric test was used to assess differences between the resistive indices.\nThe statistical evaluation showed a significant difference in the resistive index only in the anterior urethra, between the distal and middle plus proximal urethra, in both the progestogenic (P = 0.002) and oestrogenic (P = 0.0127) phases.\nThis study confirmed that the vascularization of the urethra plays an important role in the 'seal' effect, which is considered one of the most important factors in urethral closure. There was a significantly greater resistive index in the anterior proximal urethra than in the middle and distal urethra. These findings suggest that the seal effect is related to the existence of a rich venous urethral vascularization, involved in the mechanism of urethral closure.

The vascularized extraembryonic membranes of the chick embryo include the area vasculosa and the chorioallantoic membrane. In this study, we investigated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and of its receptor-2, specifically expressed by the endothelial cells, in the chick area vasculosa at days 6, 10 and 14 of incubation. Our results indicate that, in all the three developmental stages examined, vascular endothelial growth factor is clearly expressed in the endodermal cells immediately adjacent to the mesodermal endothelial cells which, in turn, expressed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. These observations suggest that during the development of the vascular system, endodermal cells, expressing vascular endothelial growth factor, initiate angiogenesis by stimulating directly mesodermal cells, which express vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. Moreover, our data demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression is also maintained by endothelial cells in the later stages of development, until day 14 of incubation. In accord with other literature data, this suggests that vascular endothelial growth factor is required not only for proliferation, but also for the survival of endothelial cells.", "journal": "The Histochemical journal", "date": "2001-09-21", "authors": ["BNico", "AVacca", "MDe Giorgis", "LRoncali", "DRibatti"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1017977007479"}
{"title": "Association between host tissue vascularity and the prognostically relevant tumor vascularity in human cervical cancer.", "abstract": "For many human solid tumors including carcinoma of the uterine cervix it has been shown that vascularity is linked to the malignant potential of the neoplasm. However, tumor microvessel density might not just represent the angiogenic potential of the neoplastic cells but could also be influenced by the primary vascularization of the host tissue. Vascular densities were assessed by systematic random sampling of normal cervical stroma and of cervical cancer tissue in surgical specimens of 52 consecutive patients. Spatially defined tumor vascular densities were related to the vascular density of the normal cervix, tumor size and survival probability. Median vascular densities of the normal cervix, tumor periphery and tumor core were 53 (range 16-105), 66 (range 24-181) and 31 (range 3-117) microvessels per mm2, respectively. Vascular densities of the tumor periphery were related to the vascular densities of the normal cervical stroma and did not depend on tumor size, whereas the vascular densities of the tumor core were independent of the vascular densities of the normal cervical stroma and decreased with increasing tumor size. Microvascular 'hot spots' were detected in the tumor periphery in 67% and in the tumor core regions in 33% of the cases. 'Hot spot' vascular densities were independent of tumor size but significantly (p=0.001) correlated with the vascular densities of the normal cervical stroma. Patients with high tumor 'hot spot' vascular densities (> or =40 vessels/counting field) had significantly (p=0.01) poorer survival probability than patients with low tumor 'hot spot' vascular densities (<40 vessels/counting field). Growth of cervical cancer is accompanied by hypervascularity at the periphery and hypovascularity within the tumor core upon comparison with the vascular density of the normal cervical stroma remote from the invasion front. Our study confirms the prognostic relevance of 'hot spot' vascular density in cancer of the uterine cervix. The association between normal cervix microvascular density remote from the tumor and the 'hot spot' vascular density of the tumor suggests an influence of the local host tissue vascularity on the tumor's aggressiveness.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "2001-09-20", "authors": ["SH\u00f6ckel", "KSchlenger", "PVaupel", "MH\u00f6ckel"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Gene transfer of transforming growth factor-beta1 to the rat peritoneum: effects on membrane function.", "abstract": "Long-term peritoneal dialysis is limited by physiologic changes in the peritoneum that lead to ultrafiltration failure. To determine the role of profibrotic cytokines in the alteration of peritoneal transport, a rodent model of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-mediated peritoneal fibrosis was established. An adenoviral vector driving the active form of TGF-beta1 (AdTGFbeta1) was administered intraperitoneally, and peritoneal structure and function were evaluated for 28 d after infection. Seven days after AdTGFbeta1 infection, thickening of the peritoneum, with cellular proliferation and increased vascularization, was noted. By day 28, there was persistent thickening and extensive collagen deposition. The mesenteric collagen content was significantly elevated, compared with control adenovirus-treated animals, 21 d after infection (2.9 versus 1.8 mg hydroxyproline/g tissue, P = 0.006). Blood vessel density, as measured using factor VIII immunohistochemical analyses, was significantly increased from day 4 to day 21 but decreased by day 28. Animals infected with AdTGFbeta1 demonstrated increased transport of solutes and decreased net ultrafiltration, which was maximal on day 7 and returned to baseline levels by day 28. It was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that TGF-beta1 induced production of vascular endothelial growth factor. Overexpression of TGF-beta1 after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer causes peritoneal fibrosis, neoangiogenesis, and increased peritoneal membrane solute transport. This model should allow further delineation of the relative contributions of profibrotic and angiogenic cytokines to changes in peritoneal function and may lead to potential new interventions for peritoneal membrane failure.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2001-09-20", "authors": ["Peter JMargetts", "MartinKolb", "TomGalt", "Catherine MHoff", "Ty RShockley", "JackGauldie"], "doi": "10.1681/ASN.V12102029"}

N-cadherin expression was detected via Western blot analysis and histochemical staining using anti-N-cadherin antibody. In both grafts, the level of N-cadherin expression increased after the operation, but during postoperative weeks 6, 9, and 12, the level in the vascularized graft was significantly (p = 0.00023, 0.0018, and 0.0010, respectively) higher than that in the nonvascularized graft. At postoperative week 14, the level of both grafts returned to the control level. Histochemical findings showed that N-cadherin was expressed around the regenerated axons in both grafts, and the degree of regeneration was greater in the vascularized graft than in the nonvascularized graft.

{"title": "Evaluation of porous networks of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) as interfacial drug delivery devices.", "abstract": "Long-term implantable drug delivery devices are desirable to achieve rapid and reliable delivery of bioactive substances to the body. The limitation of most implantable devices is the resulting chronic inflammatory response and fibrous encapsulation of the implant, which prevents effective drug delivery for prolonged periods. One method of overcoming this problem is the addition of an intermediary that could prevent capsule formation. Biocompatible materials with interconnected pore structures greater than 8-10 microm have been shown to support the ingrowth and maintenance of vascularized tissue. In this investigation, we evaluate the efficacy of using porous hydrogel sponges for the tissue interface in an implantable drug delivery device. Porous networks of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) were synthesized using a thermally initiated free-radical solution polymerization. To characterize the microstructure of the PHEMA networks, scanning electron microscopy and mercury porosimetry were used. By altering the solvent fraction in the reaction mixture, PHEMA sponges were synthesized with interconnected pores ranging in size from from 6 to 15 microm with porosities of 55% to 87%. Following the in vitro evaluation, sponges were attached to the distal end of a 20-gauge catheter tubing, and implanted subcutaneously and intraperitoneally. After 5 months implantation, insulin was infused into the devices from external pumps and rapid insulin absorption was observed in conjunction with dramatic lowering of blood glucose levels.

Recently, we showed that E6/E7-mediated inactivation of p53/pRb, ras pathway activation (initiated by expression of mutant H-Ras), and expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in combination converted normal human astrocytes into cells that formed intracranial tumors resembling human anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). In this study, we created human astrocytes that, in addition to expressing E6/E7, hTERT, and Ras, also expressed a constitutive activated form of Akt intended to mimic the Akt activation noted in grade IV glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Although these cells grew no differently than astrocytes expressing E6, E7, and H-Ras in vitro or in the first 28 days following s.c. implantation, they ultimately formed tumors four to six times larger than those formed by the E6/E7/hTERT/Ras cells. Unlike the poorly vascularized, necrosis-free AA formed by E6/E7/hTERT/Ras cells, the tumors formed by s.c. or intracranial injection of Akt-expressing cells had large areas of necrosis surrounded by neovascularization and were consistent in appearance with grade IV human GBM.

Tracheal reconstructive tissue was characterized as providing for vascularization, support, and/or lining. A tissue equivalent was developed in the rabbit for each of the individual tissues. The individual tissues consisted of nonepithelialized soft tissue (vascularized fascia), epithelialized tissue (vascularized fascia grafted with buccal mucosa), and supportive tissue (ear cartilage). The 3 reconstructive tissues were evaluated in 30 rabbits after repair of an anterior laryngotracheal defect. Morphometric and histologic analysis was applied to the reconstructions. After a 1-month follow-up period, defects repaired with nonepithelialized soft tissue showed healing by secondary intention and a wound that was contracted to 44% of the initial surface area of the defect. Mucosa-lined soft tissue flaps and cartilage grafts showed a less than 10% wound contraction. Compared to cartilage grafts, mucosalined soft tissue (vascularized fascia grafted with buccal mucosa) seemed preferable for clinical use, because it showed healing by primary intention. A mucosa-lined radial forearm fascia flap was used successfully in cases of restenosis after tracheal resection. One deficiency of the mucosa-lined soft tissue was the absence of supportive tissue. In cases of extensive stenosis, it might be useful to obtain additional expansion of the airway lumen by creating a convexity at the site of reconstruction. In a second set of experiments, we attempted to improve the mucosa-lined soft tissue concept by adding elastic cartilage. A composite tissue consisting of vascularized fascia, buccal mucosa, and auricular cartilage was developed. Heterotopic prefabrication of the composite tissue was essential for survival of the cartilaginous component. Additional airway lumen expansion could be obtained after heterotopic flap prefabrication. After experimental evaluation, the concept of the prefabricated composite tissue was successfully applied in a clinical case of long-segment stenosis.

{"title": "Relation of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and 2 alpha in operable non-small cell lung cancer to angiogenic/molecular profile of tumours and survival.", "abstract": "Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha are important proteins involved in the regulation of the transcription of a variety of genes related to erythropoiesis, glycolysis and angiogenesis. Hypoxic stimulation results in rapid increase of the HIF1alpha and 2alpha protein levels, as a consequence of a redox-sensitive stabilization. The HIFalphas enter the nucleus, heterodimerize with the HIF1beta protein, and bind to DNA at the hypoxia response elements (HREs) of target genes. In this study we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of these proteins in 108 tissue samples from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in normal lung tissues. Both proteins showed a mixed cytoplasmic/nuclear pattern of expression in cancer cells, tumoural vessels and tumour-infiltrating macrophages, as well as in areas of metaplasia, while normal lung components showed negative or very weak cytoplasmic staining. Positive HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha expression was noted in 68/108 (62%) and in 54/108 (50%) of cases respectively. Correlation analysis of HIF2alpha expression with HIF1alpha expression showed a significant association (P< 0.0001, r = 0.44). A strong association of the expression of both proteins with the angiogenic factors VEGF (P< 0.004), PD-ECGF (P< 0.003) and bFGF (P< 0.04) was noted. HIF1alpha correlated with the expression of bek-bFGF receptor expression (P = 0.01), while HIF2alpha was associated with intense VEGF/KDR-activated vascularization (P = 0.002). HIF2alpha protein was less frequently expressed in cases with a medium microvessel density (MVD); a high rate of expression was noted in cases with both low and high MVD (P = 0.006). Analysis of overall survival showed that HIF2alpha expression was related to poor outcome (P = 0.008), even in the group of patients with low MVD (P = 0.009).

{"title": "Time necessary for neovascularization of a tracheal segment by the sternohyoid muscle.", "abstract": "The reimplantation of a complete tracheal segment (CTS) as an autograft or homograft often results in total or partial necrosis of the CTS. However, previous experiments suggested that when the CTS is first vascularized by the sternohyoid muscle (SM) 21 days before the reimplantation, the CTS can be reimplanted without ischemia or stenosis. However, it is not clear if the CTS requires 21 days to attain full revascularization.\nThis study aims to ascertain the minimum time necessary for revascularization of the 6 rings CTS by the SM allowing reimplantation free of ischemia.\nFifteen mongrel dogs, divided into 3 groups were submitted to 2 sequential surgical procedures. In the first procedure, a SM flap was used to envelop 6 rings CTS in all dogs. After periods of 21 days (group 1, n = 5), 14 days (group 2, n = 5) and 7 days (group 3, n = 5), the compound flaps (CTS and SM) were neovascularized. Each CTS was transected and mobilized from the trachea and then replaced again in its original site, as an autoflap.\nAfter a period of at least 60 days, none of dogs presented any respiratory alteration. Macroscopic and microscopic analyses demonstrated adequate viability and no stenosis.\nOur findings suggest that it is possible to neovascularize the CTS using a SM flap within a period as short as 1 week.", "journal": "Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2001-09-14", "authors": ["S ATecchio", "F Vde Mello-Filho", "R CMartins Mamede", "M ALlorach Velludo"], "doi": "10.1067/mhn.2001.116980"}

The area of fusion largely determines the imaging modalities used. Thoracic conjunction is most common and requires cardiac assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography provide excellent anatomic and bone detail, demonstrating organ position, shared viscera, and limited vascular anatomy. Contrast material radiography allows evaluation of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and a shared liver requires assessment of anatomy, vascularization, and biliary drainage. Angiography helps define specific vascular supply, which is useful in determining the distribution of shared structures between the twins at surgery. Each set of conjoined twins is unique.

The goal of the present study was to develop reliable methods for successful generation of short-term primary tissue xenografts from benign and tumor-derived human prostate tissue. Primary human prostate xenografts were established in athymic nu/nu mice from eight of eight benign and five of five prostate cancer tissues, collected from a total of 10 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer. An average of 13 xenografts was established per specimen. Two tissue specimens were cryopreserved for >1 month before successful generation of prostate xenografts. After 1 month in vivo, xenograft tissues were harvested and examined regarding: gross evidence of vascularization; tissue morphology; proliferation; apoptosis; and expression of androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen, and high molecular weight cytokeratins specific for basal cells in the prostate. Direct comparison of the original tissue specimen and the 1-month xenografts revealed similar histology; similar apoptotic and proliferative fractions in most cases; and comparable expression levels and expression patterns of androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen, and high molecular weight cytokeratins. These data demonstrate that primary human prostate xenografts, benign and malignant, can be established routinely from human prostate tissue surgical specimens, and that the xenografts maintain tissue architecture and expression of key prostatic markers.

In the last three cases of index lengthening, the distal part was translocated to the tip of the third, deepening at the same stage the first web. The most frequently treated malformation was symbrachydactyly (22 cases).\nMean lengthening was 2.3 cm (0.9 to 3.5) with a mean treatment duration of 3.8 months (1.5 - 8.2).

There was a significant difference between phalanx and metacarpal lengthening, but the amount of lengthening or treatment duration were not affected by technique (Ilizarov vs bone grafting) or age.

The purpose of this study was to produce new bone vascularized in nature to increase the survival rate of the subsequently grafted bone and to fabricate the newly formed bone into the desired shape. Silicone molds in the shape of a rat mandible were used to deliver rat bone matrix impregnated with or without rhBMP-2. A muscle pedicle the same size as the mold was raised on the saphenous vessels in the rat thigh and then sandwiched in the center of the silicone molds. The molds were sliced in half and each section was filled with rat bone matrix that was impregnated either with 25 microg of rhBMP-2 for the experimental group or with diluting material alone for the control group. The sandwiched flaps were then secured by tying them to the adjacent muscles and were harvested at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Three and six rats were used in the control and experimental groups at each time point, respectively. Bone formation was assessed in the ex vivo specimens by macroscopic, radiologic, and histologic evaluation. Macroscopically, the continuation of the vascular pedicle was clearly visible for both the control and experimental muscle flaps. However, no evidence of muscle-tissue transformation was observed in the control flaps, whereas all the flaps treated with rhBMP-2 produced new bone that replicated the shape of the mold exactly and had saphenous vessels supplying the newly formed bone.

We tested this model as an in vivo system for prostate cancer research.\nSingle cell suspensions of LNCaP, PC-3 and Tsu-Pr1 human prostatic cancer cell lines as well as 2 immortalized normal human prostate epithelial cell lines were inoculated on the chorioallantoic membrane of fertilized chicken eggs on day 5 or 6 of breeding. Tumor growth and viability of the embryo was evaluated by stereo microscopy. At day 10 the membranes were removed and embedded in paraffin. Cell morphology was assessed after hematoxylin and eosin staining. Cellular expression of cytokeratin, prostate specific antigen and androgen receptor as well as apoptosis induction was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\nThree days after tumor cell inoculation on the extraembryonic vascular system of the chorioallantoic membrane cell growth and formation of 3-dimensional tumors became apparent in 100% of inoculated membranes. Strong neo-angiogenesis was detected next to the established tumors and tumor cells invading the stroma of the chorioallantoic membrane.

Ultrasound microbubbles may be used as cavitation nuclei for drug and gene delivery. By tailoring the physical properties of microbubbles and coating materials, drugs and genetic drugs can be incorporated into ultrasound contrast agents. As the microbubbles enter the region of insonation, the microbubbles cavitate, locally releasing the therapeutic agents. Cavitation also causes a local shockwave that improves cellular uptake of the therapeutic agent. As a result of the human genome project and continuing advances in molecular biology, many therapeutic genes have been discovered. In the cardiovascular system, gene therapy has the potential to improve myocardial vascularization and ameliorate congestive heart failure. For successful development of clinical gene therapy, however, effective gene delivery vectors are needed. Ultrasound contrast agents can be used to develop new, more effective vectors for gene delivery. Transthoracic ultrasound can be focused on the heart so that an intravenous injection of gene-bearing microbubbles will deliver genes relatively selectively to the myocardium.

{"title": "Transcriptional regulation of vascular development.", "abstract": "Vascular development is a highly organized sequence of events that requires the correct spatial and temporal expression of specific sets of genes leading to the development of a primary vascular network. The first step in this process is the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into endothelial cells. This is followed by endothelial proliferation, migration, and eventual formation of endothelial tubes. Maturation of these primitive tubes into fully developed blood vessels requires the recruitment of surrounding pericytes and their differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells. Many of the events that occur during vasculogenesis are recapitulated during angiogenesis. Transcription factors have been shown to serve as master switches for regulating a number of developmental processes. Using a candidate gene approach, the genomic regulatory regions required to direct vascular-specific gene expression of several receptor tyrosine kinases that are critical for vasculogenesis have been characterized and some of the transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of these genes have recently been identified. Many of these factors are also involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis and may have overlapping functions in determining hematopoietic and endothelial differentiation. Targeted disruption of other transcription factors that were not previously thought to be involved in vascular development have also been recently shown to play a role in blood vessel development.

In each case, one side was treated with the PL and the other with the CWL. The condition of the patients and the treated tissue were monitored periodically after treatment. Histologic assessment of punch biopsies was performed 3 months and 1 year after treatment with hematoxylin-eosin, Masson trichromic, and Verhoeff's stains.\nThe areas treated with the PL achieved earlier epithelialization with a good appearance. Longer-lasting erythema was observed on the side treated with the CWL. On a histologic level, although the PL-treated tissue epithelialized more quickly, at 3 months and 1 year the collagen was better compacted and better aligned in the CWL-treated tissue, and the macroscopic appearance of the CWL-treated areas was more enhanced.\nThe more active vascularization seen in the CWL-treated tissue, associated with the longer-lasting erythema and possibly greater collateral thermal injury, is possibly the reason for the better collagenization and remodeling of collagen and elastin fibers as compared with the results with the PL-treated tissue. This may explain the longer effect associated with CWL treatment.

Laminin, collagen IV, and collagen VII were usually either not present or were present only in discontinuous segments on the surface of the erosion. Fibronectin usually coated the surface of the erosion, either as a continuous sheet or in discontinuous segments. Transmission electron microscopy of 15 samples revealed that the basement membrane was either absent in the area of the erosion or was present only in discontinuous segments. Scanning electron microscopy of eight of nine samples confirmed the absence of continuous basement membrane. Epithelial and extracellular matrix components in the peripheral cornea appeared normal.\nMost canine patients with spontaneous chronic corneal epithelial defects do not have a normal basement membrane structure in the region of the epithelial defect and have other abnormalities in the subjacent extracellular matrix that may reflect a part of the underlying pathophysiology of chronic and recurrent erosions.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2001-08-31", "authors": ["EBentley", "G AAbrams", "DCovitz", "C SCook", "C AFischer", "DHacker", "C MStuhr", "T WReid", "C JMurphy"], "doi": null}

The model deals with a \"delivering\" artery system of an organ that is characterized, first, by the space-filling embedding into the organ tissue and, second, by the uniform distribution of the blood pressure drop over it. The latter assumption is justified using the available physiological data and the idea about conditions needed for perfect self-regulation.

A urethroplasty was performed in 15 patients with middle or posterior hypospadias using a double-faced onlay preputial flap (DOPF). In this method, the urethral plate is preserved and a double-faced preputial flap is developed. The inner face of the flap is sutured to the urethral plate to create the neourethra and the outer face together with the rest of the dorsal prepuce is used for ventral skin coverage. Postoperative complications occurred in 2 patients: 1 developed a fistula in the subcoronal region and 1 had dorsal skin necrosis and suture disruption of the glanular wings. The overall complication rate was 13%. The DOPF provides a well-vascularized ventral skin cover and reduces the area of avascular dorsal skin. The viability of the neourethra can be evaluated by simply looking at the outer face of the flap. However, the complication rate is similar to that of other techniques.", "journal": "Pediatric surgery international", "date": "2001-08-31", "authors": ["T WChin", "C SLiu", "C FWei"], "doi": "10.1007/s003830000566"}

The detection method is an iterative tracking of the vessel centreline with subvoxel accuracy and precise orientation estimation. This tracking algorithm deals with forks. Centrelines of the vessels are modelled by second-order B-spline. This method is used to obtain a high-level description of the whole vascular network. Applications to real angiographic data are presented. An MRA sequence has been designed, and a global segmentation of the whole vascular tree is realised in three steps. Applications of this work are accurate 3D representation of the vessel centreline and of the vascular tree, and visualisation. The tracking process is also successfully applied to 3D contrast enhanced MR digital subtracted angiography (3D-CE-MRA) of the inferior member vessels. In addition, detection of artery stenosis for routine clinical use is possible due to the high precision of the tracking algorithm.", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "date": "2001-08-29", "authors": ["NFlasque", "MDesvignes", "J MConstans", "MRevenu"], "doi": "10.1016/s1361-8415(01)00038-x"}
{"title": "HOXB7: a key factor for tumor-associated angiogenic switch.", "abstract": "We had demonstrated previously a functional bridge between altered homebox (HOX) gene expression and tumor progression through HOXB7 transactivation of basic fibroblast growth factor. Here, we have studied whether HOXB7, in addition to basic fibroblast growth factor, may induce other genes directly or indirectly related to neoangiogenesis and tumor invasion. Parental, beta-galactosidase-transduced, and HOXB7-transduced SkBr3 cell lines were examined for the expression of several growth factors and growth factor receptors involved in the proliferative and angiogenic processes. Vascular endothelial growth factor, melanoma growth-stimulatory activity/growth-related oncogenene alpha, interleukin-8, and angiopoietin-2 were up-regulated by HOXB7 transduction. The exception was angiopoietin-1 expression that was abrogated. Additional analyses included the expression levels of enzymes such as matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and heparanase, capable of proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix and basement membranes. Results showed an induction of only MMP-9. The functional implication of such a finding was tested using an in vitro coculture assay in a three-dimensional matrix. A delay of differentiation with persistent nests of proliferating cells was found in endothelial cells cocultured with HOXB7-transduced SkBr3 cells. Tumorigenicity of these cells has been evaluated in vivo. Xenograft into athymic nude mice showed that SkBr3/HOXB7 cells developed tumors in mice, either irradiated or not, whereas parental SkBr3 cells did not show any tumor take unless mice were sublethally irradiated. Comparison of tumor nodules for vascularization by CD-31 and CD-34 immunostaining revealed an increased number of blood vessels in tumors expressing HOXB7. Together, the results indicate HOXB7 as a key factor up-regulating a variety of proangiogenic stimuli. Thus, HOXB7 gene or protein is a target to aim at to inhibit tumor-associated neoangiogenesis, considering the number and the redundancy of proangiogenic molecules that should be targeted one by one to theoretically achieve the same effect.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2001-08-28", "authors": ["ACar\u00e8", "FFelicetti", "EMeccia", "LBottero", "MParenza", "AStoppacciaro", "CPeschle", "M PColombo"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Migration pathways of human glioblastoma cells xenografted into the immunosuppressed rat brain.", "abstract": "Diffuse invasion of the brain by tumor cells is a hallmark of human glioblastomas and a major cause for the poor prognosis of these tumors. This phenomenon is only partially reproduced by rodent models of gliomas that display a very high rate of proliferation and limited cell migration. We have analyzed the development of human glioblastoma cells (GL15) xenografted into the brain of immunosuppressed rats, in order to define the characteristics of tumor cell invasion. As identified by the specific immunolabeling of the tumor cells for the human HLA-ABC antigen, GL15 tumors reproduced the three types of intraparenchymal invasion observed in patients. First, a majority of multipolar tumor cells intermingled rapidly and profusely with host neural cells in the margin of the injection site. This progressively enlarging area was principally responsible for the tumor growth over time. Second, in the gray matter, columns of thin bipolar tumor cells aligned along capillary walls. Third, in the white matter, elongated bipolar isolated tumor cells were observed scattered between axonal fibers. The maximum migration distances along white matter fibers remained significantly higher than the maximum migration distances along blood vessels, up to two months after injection. Development of the tumor was associated with a significant increase of vascularization in the area of tumor spread. Xenografting of human GL15 glioblastoma cells into the immunosuppressed rat brain allowed to differentiate between the three classical types of invasion identified in the clinic, to quantify precisely the distances of migration, and to evaluate cell morphology for each of these routes. The present results support the existence of host/tumor cells interactions with specific characteristics for each type of invasion.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2001-08-25", "authors": ["J SGuillamo", "FLisovoski", "CChristov", "CLe Gu\u00e9rinel", "G LDefer", "MPeschanski", "TLefran\u00e7ois"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1010620420241"}
{"title": "Ultrasound contrast agents: properties, principles of action, tolerance, and artifacts.", "abstract": "The concept of contrast imaging was introduced to ultrasound almost 30 years ago. The development of ultrasound contrast agents (USCAs), initially slowed by technical limitations, has become more dynamic during the past decade. The ideal USCA should be non-toxic, injectable intravenously, capable of crossing the pulmonary capillary bed after a peripheral injection, and stable enough to achieve enhancement for the duration of the examination. While satisfying cost-benefit requirements, it should provide not only Doppler but also gray-scale enhancement. Already, Doppler examinations are improved by using USCAs when studying deep and small vessels, vessels with low or slow flow, or vessels with a non-optimal insonation angle. Ultrasound contrast agents also enhance detection of flow within abnormal vessels, including tumor vascularization and stenotic vessels, and provide better delineation of ischemic areas. Research is focusing on the development of specific contrast imaging sequences that allow detection of tissue enhancement similar to that obtained with CT or MRI. These sequences take advantage of the nonlinear behavior of the microbubbles within the ultrasound field, bringing real-time perfusion imaging for liver, kidney, and the myocardium into reach. New objectives include targeted agents that could further widen USCA applications to specific delivery of active drugs such as anticoagulants or cytotoxic compounds. The combination of new generations of USCAs and new ultrasound image sequences appears to be very promising and currently represents a significant part of ultrasound research.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2001-08-25", "authors": ["J MCorreas", "LBridal", "ALesavre", "AM\u00e9jean", "MClaudon", "OH\u00e9l\u00e9non"], "doi": "10.1007/s003300100940"}
{"title": "Skeletal reconstruction with a free vascularized fibula graft associated to bone allograft after resection of malignant bone tumor of limbs.", "abstract": "Over the last twenty years, progress in diagnosis and in adjuvant therapy in the field of malignant bone tumor treatment has allowed for development of limb-saving surgical techniques after oncological excision. In this context, the use of vascularized fibula for transplantation represents an important instrument in the reconstruction of bone, either with or without allografts.Moreover, in pediatric cases, the vascularized transplant of the proximal fibula with its open physis allows for an adequate reconstruction of the bone loss and the possibility of conserving the growth potential of the segment. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the various reconstructive possibilities that the use of the combined graft technique (VFT plus allograft) offers in the treatment of large-scale bone loss. In our department from 1988 to 2000, 142 vascularized fibula transplants were performed in oncological cases. Surgical reconstruction was carried out on the tibia in 70 cases, on the femur in 40, on the humerus in 26 and on the radius in 6. Combined graft intercalary reconstructions were 92. In 22 pediatric cases the fibula was transplanted, including the proximal growing epiphysis in the graft; in two of these cases massive allograft was associated to the VFG. Because of its biological properties, the grafted vascularized fibula allowed for fast bone fusion at the level of the osteotomy. It has also demonstrated a tendency of progressive hypertrophy and osteointegration with the allograft, when used. In 22 pediatric cases, the fibula graft with the proximal epiphysis maintained its ability to grow. Unsuccessful outcomes caused by vascular, mechanical, or septic failure were equal to 8.2 %.

Through the dissection of 63 legs of Korean cadavers, we demonstrated that in most cases the musculoperiosteal (mp) and septocutaneous (sc) branches of the peroneal artery were distributed at the middle and lower thirds of the fibula. There were double the number of mp perforators to the skin compared to sc branches. This indicates the inclusion of a generous > 1 cm cuff of Peroneous longus and flexor hallucis longus (FHL) in the distal and middle third of the fibula. The location of the nutrient foramen was just proximal to the midpoint.

T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high signal intensity mass in the suprasellar region without perifocal edema. T1-weighted MRI with gadolinium showed a homogeneously enhanced mass.

On the basis of the pre-operative diagnosis of tuberculum sellae meningioma, total tumor removal was performed. Photomicrographs of the specimen showed numerous capillaries divided by stroma cells. Positive immunostaining for factor VIII related antigen (F VIII RAg) was observed in endothelial cells, but immunostaining for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) was not observed in any cells. A diagnosis of suprasellar hemangioblastoma was made on the basis of these findings. The patient suffered paraparesis on the postoperative seventh day. Since MRI showed a thoracic tumor, a second total tumor removal was performed. The tumor was diagnosed as a meningothelial meningioma.

Thirty-seven malignant melanomas, which had been implanted intra- or subcutaneously in 22 mice, were examined. Various B-mode criteria, power Doppler criteria and spectral Doppler parameters were evaluated before and after IV-application of the d-galactose-based contrast agent Levovist. After sonographic examination, all tumors were analyzed histologically with semiquantitative grading of tumoral vascularization. Unenhanced, in 70% of the tumors, no intratumoral vessels were visible using power Doppler, but only in 11% of the intracutaneous and in 0% of the subcutaneous after injection of the contrast agent. The enhanced mode was definitely superior to unenhanced Doppler in showing the intratumoral vascularity. The intratumoral vascular structure could be sufficiently analyzed in 30% of all tumors by unenhanced Doppler, but in 92% enhanced. The mean percentage vessel area increased about 433% after application of Levovist (intracutaneous: 485%, subcutaneous: 280%). Despite the missing direct correlation between the sonographically and histologically determined grade of tumor vascularization (Pearson's correlation unenhanced 0,356, p <.05/enhanced 0.395, p <.05), the correlation between the percentage vessel area and the histologic grade of vascularization was improved after application of the contrast agent (Pearson's correlation unenhanced 0.347, p <.05/enhanced 0.686, p <.01).

E-cadherin expression was detected by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining with anti E-cadherin monoclonal antibody.

Furthermore, repair of the neural tissue structure was examined by toluidine blue staining.\nIn both cases, the level of E-cadherin expression decreased at first, and then gradually increased. The maximum level was 1.61 +/- 0.066-fold in the nonvascularized nerve graft and 2.254 +/- 0.071-fold in the vascularized nerve graft. From the 1st to the 16th postoperative weeks, the level of E-cadherin expression in the vascularized nerve graft was significantly higher than that in the nonvascularized nerve graft. In the immunofluorescent staining, E-cadherin expression was almost negative or decreased immediately after the operation, but the degree of expression was gradually increased in Schwann cells. The degree of E-cadherin expression in the vascularized nerve graft was greater than that in the nonvascularized nerve graft. In toluidine blue staining, the velocity of tissue repair was more rapid in the vascularized nerve graft than in the nonvascularized graft.\nThese results demonstrate that the E-cadherin expression of grafted nerve was increased during the nerve regeneration, and the expression was mainly observed in Schwann cells.

These objectives attempted to provide answers to the following questions: a) Are there currently substantial changes in the biological behavior of renal adenocarcinoma?, b) Does the route of tumor dissemination (direct infiltration through the capsule, lymphohematogenous, cancer embolus carried by the bloodstream to a distant location) affect the rate of progression to stages III and IV?, and c) What are the most relevant findings of the imaging methods that aid in determining the extent of the renal tumor?\n106 renal masses were evaluated; of these, 93 were renal adenocarcinomas. The diagnosis, clinical evaluation and preoperative staging were based on the clinical history, physical examination, symptoms and imaging methods (IVP, US, CT, and MRI) to assess renal morphological changes, presence of calcifications, mass effect, tumor mass ultrasound characteristics, densitometry or MR signal pattern, perinephric fat involvement, venous vasculature, involvement of renal fascia, locoregional lymph nodes or metastasis and distant neoplastic changes.\nA third of the tumors had a size greater than 10 cms and practically half were 5-10 cms in size. Calcifications were found in 47%; 85% were punctiform and showed a central location. 88% of the tumors showed areas of necrosis. Due to the presence, in most of the cases, of a viable tumor, necrosis, calcification or cystic degeneration, the adenocarcinomas showed a very inhomogeneous ultrasound pattern and with varying degrees of vascularization on CT volumetric assessment. Invasion of perinephric fat and tumor fibrous septae were found in 65% on CT evaluation, although MRI was particularly sensitive in detecting fat infiltration in the early stages of perinephric involvement, venous thrombosis, involvement of adjacent and distant organs and tumor hemorrhagic changes.\nIn determining the biological behaviour of renal adenocarcinoma, preoperative staging of infiltration and prognosis, US, volumetric CT and MRI are currently the diagnostic methods with the highest accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. These diagnostic methods allow early detection of tumors thereby making them potentially curable. Lymphatic drainage of the tumor may be determinant in its more or less rapid progression from Robson stage II to IIIa and IIIb, and thereafter to stage IV. CT and MRI showed a higher accuracy for tumor detection, localization, determining local extent, tumor characterization and staging.

In adult, cells with the antigenic phenotype of mature perinatal astrocytes were restricted to a region surrounding the optic nerve head (ONH), whereas cells at a fourth stage of differentiation, adult astrocytes (Pax2-/vimentin-/GFAP+), were apparent throughout the vascularized retina. APC appearance was centered around the ONH and preceded the appearance of perinatal astrocytes.

{"title": "Early chemokine cascades in murine cardiac grafts regulate T cell recruitment and progression of acute allograft rejection.", "abstract": "The identification of early inflammatory events after transplant in solid tissue organ grafts that may direct T cell recruitment and promote acute allograft rejection remain largely unknown. To better understand temporal aspects of early inflammatory events in vascularized organ grafts, we tested the intragraft expression of four different chemokines in heterotopically transplanted A/J (H-2(a)) and syngeneic heart grafts in C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) recipient mice from 1.5 to 48 h after transplant. Similar temporal expression patterns and equivalent levels of chemokine expression were observed in both syngeneic and allogeneic cardiac allografts during this time period. Expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant growth-related oncogene alpha (KC) was observed first and reached peak levels by 6 h after transplant and was followed by the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (JE) and then macrophage inflammatory proteins 1beta and 1alpha. Administration of rabbit KC antiserum to allograft recipients within 30 min of cardiac transplantation attenuated downstream events including intra-allograft expression of the T cell chemoattractants IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 and monokine induced by IFN-gamma, cellular infiltration into the allograft, and graft rejection. Similarly, depletion of recipient neutrophils at the time of transplantation significantly extended allograft survival from day 8 to 10 in control-treated recipients up to day 21 after transplant. These results indicate the induction of highly organized cascades of neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractants in cardiac grafts and support the proposal that early inflammatory events are required for optimal recruitment of T cells into allografts during the progression of acute rejection of cardiac allografts.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2001-08-18", "authors": ["KMorita", "MMiura", "D RPaolone", "T MEngeman", "AKapoor", "D GRemick", "R LFairchild"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.167.5.2979"}

In the investigated period of fetal development, the general vascular architecture of the spinal cord, corresponding to that described postnatally, seemed to be already established. The observed changes included: (1) remodeling of the supplying (extrinsic) arterial branches, (2) transformation of the posterior anastomotic chain into two distinct posterior spinal arteries, and (3) development of the capillary networks in the gray and white matter. The remodeling of the radicular arteries supplying the spinal cord was accompanied by a decrease in their number and transition from regular to irregular distribution (appearance of intersegmental differences in their frequency). The anterior spinal artery and regular array of the central arteries were already present in the youngest fetuses examined, but the final remodeling of the posterior anastomotic chain into two posterior spinal arteries occurred between 15th and 20th week of fetal life indicating that the vascularization of the anterior region of the spinal cord in the investigated period of fetal life was more advanced as compared with that of the posterior region. The capillary network of the gray matter in the youngest fetuses had the form of discrete glomerular plexuses supplied by groups of central arteries and mainly vascularizing the anterior horns. Successively, the plexuses fused to form a continuous system along the anterior columns and the system expanded to fully vascularize the posterior horns. The white matter in the earlier fetal period seemed to be partially avascular, later the density of capillaries vascularizing those areas was still much lower than in the gray matter. The veins showed considerably greater variability than the arteries, as far as their topography and distribution was concerned. High tortuosity characterized the superficial veins, especially in the younger fetuses, although the degree of tortuosity differed even between individual fetuses. Only anterior spinal and central arteries were usually accompanied by their venous counterparts, the other veins seemed to have no regular topographical relations with the arteries.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2001-08-18", "authors": ["JZawili\u0144ski", "J ALitwin", "MNowogrodzka-Zag\u00f3rska", "JGorczyca", "A JMiodo\u0144ski"], "doi": "10.1016/S0940-9602(01)80175-8"}

{"title": "Influence of different biodegradable carriers on the in vivo behavior of human adipose precursor cells.", "abstract": "The correction of soft-tissue defects presents a challenge in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The implantation of isolated and culture-expanded adipose precursor cells is a solution to this problem because these cells differentiate into adipocytes when implanted in vivo. Appropriate scaffolds are needed in soft-tissue engineering to allow the differentiation of precursor cells. The optimal carrier needs to be defined. In this study, human preadipocytes were isolated and cultured. Three different carrier materials were seeded with 106 preadipocytes each and implanted in 42 nude mice. Sponges and nonwoven carriers based on hyaluronic acid modified by esterification (HYAFF 11) were compared with collagen sponges. Scaffolds without cells served as negative controls in the same animal. After 3 and 8 weeks, the grafts were explanted. Macroscopic appearance, weight, thickness, microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and TEM (scaffold structure, cellularity, penetration depth of the seeded cells, vascularization) were assessed and evaluated for differences in scaffold-cell interactions.Preadipocytes differentiated earlier in vitro when attached to HYAFF 11 scaffolds than to other carrier materials. Macroscopically, all preadipocyte constructs were yellowish and well vascularized, and the controls were white and avascular. Vessel formation was more pronounced around mature adipocytes. Microscopically, HYAFF 11 constructs showed a higher cell density than collagen constructs. The pores of the sponges contained more differentiated adipocytes than the nonwoven carriers, whereas the undifferentiated preadipocytes were more numerous in the nonwoven material. Penetration of adipose precursor cells was deeper and more homogeneous in HYAFF 11 scaffolds. Electron microscopy demonstrated well-differentiated adipocytes and large amounts of extracellular matrix in HYAFF 11 sponges.HYAFF 11 sponges supported the expansion and differentiation of the adipose precursor cells. This carrier is superior to the nonwoven carrier with regard to adipocyte differentiation and superior to the collagen sponge with regard to cellularity.

Conversely, EphB4, a specific receptor for ephrin-B2, is expressed on venous ECs, and both ephrin-B2 and EphB4 play essential roles in vascular development. The bidirectional signals between EphB4 and ephrin-B2 are thought to be specific for the interaction between arteries and veins and to regulate cell mixing and the making of particular boundaries. However, the molecular mechanism during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis remains unclear. Manipulative functional studies were performed on these proteins in an endothelial cell system. Using in vitro stromal cells (OP9 cells) and a paraaortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp) coculture system, these studies found that the stromal cells expressing ephrin-B2 promoted vascular network formation and ephrin-B2(+) EC proliferation and that they also induced the recruitment and proliferation of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)-positive cells. Stromal cells expressing EphB4 inhibited vascular network formation, ephrin-B2(+) EC proliferation, and alpha-SMA(+) cell recruitment and proliferation.

In vitro release of human VEGF165 (2 and 4 microg/cm3 microsphere) was studied for 3 weeks under static conditions at 25 degrees C, and daily hormone release was measured using a competitive enzyme immunoassay. Following an uncontrolled release within the first 4 days, a quite constant zero-order VEGF release of 50 to 90 and 70 to 120 ng/day was achieved from 2 and 4 microg/cm3 polymer loaded microspheres respectively. In vivo angiogenesis was studied for a period of 8 weeks and evaluated using immunoperoidase staining and histopathological measurements.

Urological complications were noted in 14 of the 166 transplantations (8.4%) in 10 boys and 4 girls, including 12 initial and 2 repeat grafts from 2 living related and 12 cadaveric donors. Five of these patients had undergone previous urological surgery. The 2 children (1.2%) with acute ureteral obstruction underwent repeat intervention after stent failure. Anastomotic leakage in 7 cases (4.2%) was treated conservatively in 1 and with a Double-J stent (Medical Engineering Corp., New York, New York) only required in 3. Reoperation was required in 3 cases. One patient (0.6%) with late ureteral stenosis underwent repeat anastomosis, 1 (0.6%) required reimplantation for recurrent pyelonephritis due to vesicoureteral reflux in the graft, 1 (0.6%) with a valve bladder required bladder augmentation and ureteral reimplantation, and 1 (0.6%) with lymphocele and 1 (0.6%) with lithiasis were successfully treated conservatively. Complications were associated with acute rejection in 6 cases. Mean followup without graft loss in patients who presented with versus without complications was 58.3 months (range 1 to 112) versus 75 (range 1 to 118). In the former patients with a mean age of 16 years 9 months versus those without urological complications mean serum creatinine was 116 and 108 mol./l., respectively. Two grafts were lost in patients with urological complications, including 1 who died of pulmonary embolism and 1 with refractory chronic rejection. Seven patients were lost to followup after 54 months (range 12 to 113) of adequate graft function.\nUreteroureteral anastomosis is a safe and effective technique for pediatric renal transplantation with a low complication rate, which may be due to better vascularization of the shorter ureteral end of the graft. Our results should encourage the use of this technique in pediatric renal transplantation.

Access is via a flank or pararectal incision and intraperitoneal surgery is minimal. The colon segments are obtained immediately proximal to the ureteral defect, necessitating little mobilization of the mesenteric pedicle. Metabolic consequences should be absent or low since only minimal amounts of intestine are isolated.

Here we show that a short treatment with these agents induces tolerance to fully mismatched mouse islet allografts that is stable to challenge with donor-type spleen cells and allows acceptance of donor-type vascularized heart grafts. Peritransplant macrophages and DCs from tolerant mice express down-regulated CD40, CD80, and CD86 costimulatory molecules. In addition, DCs from the graft area of tolerant mice secrete, upon stimulation with CD4+ cells, 10-fold lower levels of IL-12 compared with DCs from acutely rejecting mice, and induce a CD4+ T cell response characterized by selective abrogation of IFN-gamma production. CD4+ but not CD8+ or class II+ cells from tolerant mice, transferred into naive syngeneic recipients, prevent rejection of donor-type islet grafts. Graft acceptance is associated with impaired development of IFN-gamma-producing type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ cells and an increased percentage of CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells expressing CD152 in the spleen and in the transplant-draining lymph node. Transfer of CD4+CD25+ cells from tolerant but not naive mice protects 100% of the syngeneic recipients from islet allograft rejection. These results demonstrate that a short treatment with immunosuppressive agents, such as 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3/mycophenolate mofetil, induces tolerance to islet allografts associated with an increased frequency of CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells that can adoptively transfer transplantation tolerance.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2001-08-08", "authors": ["SGregori", "MCasorati", "SAmuchastegui", "SSmiroldo", "A MDavalli", "LAdorini"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.167.4.1945"}

Here we report that BTO-956 given to Fischer 344 rats also inhibits corneal angiogenesis and the growth and neovascularization of the R3230Ac rat mammary carcinoma tumor implanted in skin-fold window chambers. Hydron pellets containing recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (50 ng) and Sucralfate (20 microg) were implanted into surgically created corneal micropockets (day 0). BTO-956 was administrated by oral gavage (500 mg/kg, twice a day for 6 days) on days 1-6 (controls received vehicle alone). On day 7, rats received retrograde infusions of India ink via the thoracic aorta to visualize the corneal vasculature. Digitized images of slide-mounted corneas from control and treated animals were taken with a microscope. For the tumor growth and angiogenesis study, small pieces of R3230Ac tumor from a donor rat were implanted into surgically prepared window chambers (day 0). BTO-956 was given during days 5-11, and images of the tumors and their vasculature were recorded on day 12. No body weight loss was observed in either study. BTO-956 significantly inhibited corneal angiogenesis (by 50-80%), as assessed by measurements of limbal circumference displaying neovascularization, vessel length, vascularized area, and vascular area density. In the window chamber assay, tumors from treated animals were >50% smaller than tumors in control animals. In addition, vascular length densities in peripheral tumor zones were 30% less in treated compared with control animals.

{"title": "VEGF-VEGF receptor complexes as markers of tumor vascular endothelium.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a primary stimulant of the vascularization of solid tumors and has therefore been the focus of intense research aimed at blocking its activity in solid tumors. VEGF production by tumor cells is induced by oncogenic gene mutations and hypoxic conditions inside the tumor mass. VEGF receptor expression on endothelial cells lining blood vessels in the tumor is also induced by hypoxia and the increased local concentration of VEGF. Therefore in the tumor microenvironment there is an upregulation of both VEGF and its receptor leading to a high concentration of occupied receptor on tumor vascular endothelium. The VEGF-VEGF receptor complex (VEGF-VEGFR) presents an attractive target for the specific delivery of drugs or other effectors to tumor endothelium. Herein we review the development of monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind to the VEGF-VEGFR and their use as targeting agents that selectively bind to VEGF activated blood vessels. Additionally, we summarize the properties of 2C3, a novel monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody that blocks VEGF from binding to VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1. 2C3 may be utilized as both an anti-angiogenic agent by inhibiting VEGFR2 activity and potentially as a vascular targeting agent by binding to blood vessels that express the VEGF-VEGFR1 complex.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2001-08-08", "authors": ["R ABrekken", "P EThorpe"], "doi": "10.1016/s0168-3659(01)00333-9"}

Relatively little is known on the topographic differences in vascular supply, distribution and density of brain capillaries in different CNS regions. We developed a simple method consisting of intravascular injection of fluorescent dyes coupled to immunocytochemical techniques that allows for simultaneous observation of glia-neuronal-vascular interactions in immersion-fixed brain specimens from small rodents. This technique permits quantitative evaluation of regional differences in glial/neuronal distribution and the study of their relationship to vascular densities. Variations of this technique also allow the detection of abnormal microvasculature (i.e. 'leaky' vessels), a useful feature for studies of blood-brain barrier function in health and disease. By use of quantitative confocal microscopy, the three-dimensional geometry of cortical and hippocampal structures revealed remarkable differences in vascularization between cortical gray/white matter junction, and hippocampal formation (CA1 and CA3 regions). Significant differences were also observed within the same investigative region: CA1 was characterized by low capillary density compared to neighboring CA3. Following an ischemic insult, CA1 vessels had more extensive blood-brain barrier leakage than CA3 vessels.

{"title": "Selective inactivation of p53 facilitates mouse epithelial tumor progression without chromosomal instability.", "abstract": "We examined the selective pressure for, and the impact of, p53 inactivation during epithelial tumor evolution in a transgenic brain tumor model. In TgT(121) mice, cell-specific inactivation of the pRb pathway in brain choroid plexus epithelium initiates tumorigenesis and induces p53-dependent apoptosis. We previously showed that p53 deficiency accelerates tumor growth due to diminished apoptosis. Here we show that in a p53(+/-) background, slow-growing dysplastic tissue undergoes clonal progression to solid angiogenic tumors in all animals. p53 is inactivated in all progressed tumors, with loss of the wild-type allele occurring in 90% of tumors. Moreover, similar progression occurs in 38% of TgT(121)p53(+/+) mice, also with loss of at least one p53 allele and inactivation of p53. Thus, the selective pressure for p53 inactivation, likely based on its apoptotic function, is high. Yet, in all cases, p53 inactivation correlates with progression beyond apoptosis reduction, from dysplasia to solid vascularized tumors. Hence, p53 suppresses tumor progression in this tissue by multiple mechanisms. Previous studies of fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells show that p53 deficiency can be associated with chromosomal instability, a mechanism that may drive tumor progression. To determine whether genomic gains or losses are present in tumors that progress in the absence of p53, we performed comparative genomic hybridization analysis. Surprisingly, the only detectable chromosomal imbalance was partial or complete loss of chromosome 11, which harbors the p53 gene and is thus the selected event. Flow cytometry confirmed that the majority of tumor cells were diploid. These studies indicate that loss of p53 function is frequent under natural selective pressures and furthermore that p53 loss can facilitate epithelial tumor progression by a mechanism in addition to apoptosis reduction and distinct from chromosomal instability.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2001-08-04", "authors": ["XLu", "GMagrane", "CYin", "D NLouis", "JGray", "TVan Dyke"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.21.17.6017-6030.2001"}

In this study, we have used a prostate tumor progression series comprised of a differentiated rat prostate epithelial cell line, NbE-1, and its highly motile clonal derivative, FB2. Injection of NbE-1 cells into the inferior vena cava of syngeneic rats indicated that these cells are nontumorigenic. Using the same model, FB2 cells generated rapidly growing and well-vascularized tumors in the lungs. NbE-1 expressed marginal levels of VEGF, whereas high levels of VEGF protein were detected in FB2-conditioned medium and in FB2 tumors in vivo. Analysis of (125)I-VEGF(165) binding to NbE-1 and FB2 cells indicated that only motile FB2 cells expressed the VEGF receptor Flt-1. Consistent with this finding, physiological concentrations of VEGF induced chemotactic migration in FB2 but not in NbE-1 cells.

In parallel with accelerated wound closure at later times, blockade of RAGE suppressed levels of cytokines; tumor necrosis factor-alpha; interleukin-6; and matrix metalloproteinases-2, -3, and -9. In addition, generation of thick, well-vascularized granulation tissue was enhanced, in parallel with increased levels of platelet-derived growth factor-B and vascular endothelial growth factor.

{"title": "Early treatment of severe mandibular hypoplasia with distraction mesenchymogenesis and bilateral free fibula flaps.", "abstract": "The technique of distraction has revolutionized the treatment of mandibular hypoplasia; however, presently large mandibular defects still require bone grafts. Microvascular grafting is commonly used in adults. Conversely, in pediatric reconstruction, nonvascularized rib grafts remain standard. Unfortunately, resorption of nonvascularized bone remains a major issue, particularly when soft tissue is hypoplastic. This case study represents a combination of techniques in the treatment of severe mandibular deficiency, and introduces the concept of distraction mesenchymogenesis. The patient was a 2 1/2-year-old boy with severe bilateral Pruzansky class III mandibular hypoplasia. He had a permanent open mouth posture, an overjet of 23 mm, and was unable to move the lower mandibular segment. His oropharyngeal airway diameter was 2.2 mm and he was tracheostomy dependent. The patient was treated with distraction of the lower jaw mesenchyme followed by bilateral functional free fibular microvascular flaps containing reinnervated muscle. This created a well-vascularized body, ramus, and condyle bilaterally within an adequate soft-tissue envelope. Postoperatively, the overjet was reduced to 5 mm. The patient can now actively move his mandible. Airway diameter increased to 10 mm, and the patient is able to tolerate intermittent tracheostomy plugging. This innovative combination of techniques allows early intervention, limits graft resorption, and improves airway control.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2001-08-03", "authors": ["E JStelnicki", "J BBoyd", "R LNott", "YBarnavon", "CUecker", "THenson"], "doi": "10.1097/00001665-200107000-00006"}

At initial examination, the tumors were evaluated for size, vascularity, location, and echogenecity (relative to placenta). Fetuses were assessed anatomically and for early signs of hydrops. Sonographic fetal and tumor examination were repeated weekly until delivery, and associated maternal complications were recorded.\nThe sonographic diagnosis of chorioangiomas was subsequently confirmed pathologically in all cases. The maximum diameter of the tumors varied between 6 and 12 cm. Chorioangioma was hyperechogenic, avascular and complicated by intrauterine fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios in one woman; a healthy but small for date infant was delivered at 38 weeks gestation. Two tumors were partially vascular and hyperechogenic, these tumors were associated with moderate polyhydramnios and preterm delivery of normal infants at 33 and 36 weeks. The remaining 3 tumors were hypoechogenic, diffusely vascular and were associated with severe polyhydramnios. In one case, the tumor was complicated by abrupt generalized non immune fetal hydrops and stillbirth; in the 2nd case, there was acute fetal distress and delivery of a premature anemic infant at 28 weeks; however, in the 3rd case, while the polyhydramnios and tumor vascularization decreased, its echogenecity increased and delivery of normal infant at full term was achieved.\nSonographic assessment of echogenicity and vascularity of the large chorioangioma appears to be detrimental in predicting the clinical outcome of pregnancy. Spontaneous regression of tumor vascularity with subsequent resolution of hydramnios may occur.

Surgical correlation was available for all these lesions. Mammography and US were performed in all patients, Color-Doppler in 13/33 and MR in 10/33.\nHistological findings by percutaneous biopsy demonstrated 26 (79%) benign, 3 (9%) atypical, and 4 (12%) malignant lesions. Histological findings after surgery confirmed the diagnosis for benign and malignant lesions, while of the 3 atypical lesions, 1 was benign and 2 were malignant. One encysted papillary carcinoma in situ at core-biopsy was classified as invasive papillary carcinoma after surgery. PLB were usually found (52%) in subareolar location and the mean size was 17 mm (range 5-60 mm). The most frequent mammographic appearance of benign PLB was of a well-defined (71%), oval (53%) mass. The microcalcifications had variable features; they were isolated in 3/27 (15%) cases and associated with masses in 4/27 (20%). The mammographic finding of papillary carcinoma was of a well-defined (50%) or ill-defined, oval (50%) or lobulated (50%) mass, but never of a spiculated mass. US finding of the benign PLB most commonly showed a well-defined (84%), oval (84%), complex solid/cystic (52%) mass with frequently (60%) posterior enhancement. US finding of papillary carcinoma was of a well-defined (50%) or ill-defined (50%), oval (50%) or lobulated (50%) mass, most commonly solid-inhomogenous-hypoechoic. Color-Doppler showed high blood flow in 8/10 benign PLB and in 2/3 malignant PLB. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging demonstrated usually well-circumscribed, round masses (71%). The intensity/time curve showed marked focal enhancement (peak signal intensity over 70% at the first minute) in both benign and malignant lesions.\nOften the patients with PBL were symptomatic (for presence of nipple discharge or palpable mass). 31/33 papillary lesions identified at the subsequent imaging-guided large-core biopsy and in the 3/33 remaining lesions percutaneous core-biopsy required a subsequent surgical biopsy for the atypical papillary lesions. US proved to have the highest sensitivity, showing the suggestive feature of a frond-like mass within a dilated duct, and color-Doppler demonstrated high blood flow (which should be considered in differential diagnosis of galactocele). Mammographic finding of papillary lesions was often consistent with benign lesions (fibroadenoma, cyst). MR confirmed the high vascularization of these lesions, showing marked enhancement of the solid component.\nUS, with Color-Doppler, proved to be the most useful examination for the identification and demonstration of the solid component of these lesions, which, observed further diagnostic investigation. As no definite mammographic, sonographic or RM pattern could be identified to differentiate between benign and malignant PLB, core-biopsy was required. Percutaneous biopsy has shown to be reliable in the diagnosis of benign and malignant PLB (without any false negative): infact, any atypical lesions require surgical examination. The framing of benign and malignant PLB with imaging and core-biopsy was useful because the frequent association of benign PLB with concurrent or subsequent breast carcinoma suggests surgical excision and radiological follow-up.", "journal": "La Radiologia medica", "date": "2001-08-02", "authors": ["MBazzocchi", "IBerra", "G EFrancescutti", "CDel Frate", "CZuiani", "FPuglisi", "CDi Loreto"], "doi": null}

The acquisition of new capillary vessels provides newly vascularized tumor nodules with a distinct biological advantage over their avascular counterparts by conferring upon them the ability to expand and develop both locally and metastatically. To identify the molecules and mechanisms underlying this rate-limiting step in successful tumorigenesis, we have developed an in vivo tumor model that reproducibly recapitulates the angiogenic switch. Using this model, we have analyzed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression and activity in both avascular and vascular growth phases of the tumor. A significantly higher level of VEGF protein was detected in avascular tumor nodules compared with vascular nodules. As avascular tumors became vascularized, VEGF levels decreased approximately 10-fold. In contrast, bFGF levels were not elevated in avascular nodules but rather were detected at levels approximately 2 times higher in vascular nodules compared with the avascular tumor nodules. Given that VEGF is transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1alpha, immunohistochemical studies of chondrosarcoma nodules were conducted and revealed that the nuclear translocation of HIF-1alpha was detected exclusively in avascular tumor nodules. This study implicates HIF-1alpha-mediated up-regulation of VEGF but not bFGF in the switch to the angiogenic phenotype during tumorigenesis.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2001-08-02", "authors": ["JFang", "LYan", "YShing", "M AMoses"], "doi": null}

The lack of success of encapsulated transplanted islets inside the peritoneal cavity is presently attributed to poor vascularization of the implant. A thick, fibrotic capsule often surrounds the graft, limiting survival. We have tested the hypothesis that neovascularization of the graft material can be induced by the addition of proper angiogenic factors embedded within a polymeric coat. Biocompatible and nonresorbable meshes coated with hydrophilic polymers were implanted in rats and harvested after 1-, 6-, and 12-week intervals. The implant response was assessed by histological observations on the degree of vascularity, fibrosis, and inflammation. Macrostructural geometry of meshes was conducive to tissue ingrowth into the interstitial space between the mesh filaments. Hydrogel coating with incorporated acidic or basic FGF in an electrostatic complex with polyelectrolytes and/or with heparin provided a sustained slow release of the angiogenic growth factor. Anti-factor VIII and anti-collagen type IV antibodies and a GSL I-B4 lectin were used to measure the extent of vascularization. Vigorous and persistent vascularization radiated several hundred microns from the implant. The level of vascularization should provide a sufficient diffusion of nutrients and oxygen to implanted islets.

The C6 rat glioma model was used as a model of high-grade glioblastoma. The signal enhancement was measured as a function of time in the vascular compartment and in different regions of interest (ROIs) within the tumor after the injection of 0.02 mmol x kg(-1) of P760. The results were compared to those obtained after the injection of 0.1 mmol x kg(-1) of Gd-DOTA. We showed that P760, in spite of a Gd concentration five times smaller, produces an enhancement in the blood pool similar to that produced by Gd-DOTA. It was shown that P760 makes possible an excellent delineation of regions containing vessels with a damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB). Images acquired 5-10 minutes after P760 injection showed the location of permeable vessels more accurately than Gd-DOTA-enhanced images. The enhancement produced in the tumor by P760 was, however, less than that produced by Gd-DOTA. The extravasation and/or diffusion rate of P760 in the interstitial medium were found to be strongly reduced, compared to those found with Gd-DOTA.

By day 30, there was concentric intimal thickening, accumulation of alpha-smA+ cells, and collagen deposition. Patchy destruction of the elastic membranes and loss of alpha-smA expression in media were evident. IL-17R:Fc for 6 days decreased MNC infiltration in the intimal and medial compartments at day 7.

Four animals received porous polyethylene implants and 6 received bone-derived hydroxyapatite implants. Small amounts of a bioadhesive (2-octyl cyanoacrylate) were applied to the underside of the muscles. Muscles were placed onto the desired location of the implant with pressure for 15 seconds. The conjunctiva was closed with a 6-0 plain gut suture, and the animals were observed for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, animals were killed and the surgical orbit was exenterated. Orbits and implants were processed for histologic analysis. In addition, tensile strength testing of muscle-implant attachments was performed and compared with various other types of muscle-implant or muscle-sclera attachments.\nAll cases resulted in integration of the muscles without slippage.

In all these patients, approximately 200 punctures were given with a bent 26-gauge needle sparing the peripheral cornea. Patients were examined on days 1 and 7, 1 month, and every 3 months after the procedure. The symptoms, corneal findings, and visual acuity of the patients at last follow-up were noted and compared with the preprocedure findings. For 11 patients who underwent PK, histopathologic study of corneal buttons was performed and a clinicopathologic correlation was attempted.\nOf the 28 patients, there were 15 men and 13 women with a mean age of 61.1 years. The clinical diagnosis was pseudophakic BK in 11 (39.3%), aphakic BK in 11 (39.3%), Fuchs' dystrophy in 4 (14.3%), failed graft in 1 (3.6%), and chronic corneal edema of unknown etiology in 1 (3.6%). The follow-up ranged from 1 to 33 months with a mean of 9.5 +/- 7.5 months. Symptomatic relief was noted in all. Twenty patients (71.4%) had complete relief, whereas eight patients (28.6%) experienced mild symptoms such as tearing and occasional pain. Visual acuity improved in 7 patients (25%), decreased in 12 (42.8%), and remained the same in 9 (32.4%). Objective evidence of scarring after ASP was noted in all patients. Complete regression of epithelial bullae and epithelial edema was found in 10 (35.7%) and partial regression in 18 (62.25%) patients.

Adhesion of epithelium with varying degrees of subepithelial fibrosis was seen in six, whereas in the remaining five buttons, there was complete denudation of the epithelium. Vascularization was seen in five and inflammation in two buttons. Clinicopathologic correlation revealed that symptomatic patients had persistent edema and loose adhesion of the epithelium to the stroma, resulting in detachment.\nASP is a simple, safe, and cost-effective outpatient procedure for symptomatic relief in patients with BK. The possibility of decreased visual acuity after the procedure should be explained to all patients.

Tumors cannot grow if new vessels are not formed to supply the cells with oxygen and other nutrients and to remove waste products. Increased angiogenesis can be correlated with tumor growth and metastatic potential in many tumor types, indicating that neoformation of vessels is a prognostic indicator of tumor behavior. We evaluated microvessel densities in 157 various pituitary adenoma types and seven pituitary carcinomas using immunocytochemistry for CD-34 antigen, a reliable marker of endothelial cells. The lowest percentage of microvessel density was found in growth hormone-producing adenomas, the highest level in pituitary carcinomas. In general, no major correlation was found between MIB-1 index (an indicator of cell proliferation) and microvessel density. The statistical study also demonstrated no gender-dependent changes in the microvessel density of pituitary tumors. Although the microvessel density was not significantly different in relation to invasiveness of pituitary tumors, our results demonstrate a tendency of invasive pituitary tumors to be more highly vascularized than non-invasive ones. Dopamine agonist and long-acting somatostatin analog treatment compared with untreated tumors did not significantly affect microvessel densities. Statistical differences were demonstrated in the microvessel density of macroadenomas between patients older and patients younger than 40 years. Significant differences were also apparent in the microvessel densities between microadenomas and macroadenomas diagnosed in young patients but not in the older age group.

{"title": "[Further experiences with transplantation of the head of the fibula].", "abstract": "We are presenting our experience with vascularized epiphyseal transplantation of the upper end of the fibula, based distally on the anterior tibial artery in two patients, one suffering from septic epiphysitis of the hip with complete loss of the head and neck of the femur, the other suffering from radial club hand following septic loss of the radius, excluding its proximal and distal articular segments. In the first patient, the fibular epiphysis bridged the bone defect and provided growth at the neck of the femur. This restored hip stability, reduced limb-length discrepancy, initiated some degree of acetabular development, and maintained a functional range of hip motion. In the second patient, transplantation of the upper end of the fibula was used to bridge a gap resulting from complete resorption of the right radius and provide for growth of the radius. At follow-up, complete union of the graft was noted. The club-hand appearance improved markedly. Pronation and supination were regained. However, donor-site morbidity was a problem. It included sloughing of part of the peroneal muscles and the skin edge of the incision. This was due to loss of the anterior tibial artery as well as injury to the peroneal vessel collaterals supplying the skin and peroneal muscles. The latter occurred due to opening of the posterior compartment of the leg in an attempt to locate the anterior tibial artery at its origin from the popliteal artery. It is therefore concluded, that transplantation of the upper end of the fibula is a valuable reconstructive alternative for septic epiphysitis with complete loss of the head and neck of the femur as well as for septic loss of the radius. However, whenever an extended part of the upper end of the fibula needs being harvested, this should be performed through an anterior approach, in order to avoid sloughing of the skin and muscles of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg.", "journal": "Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...", "date": "2001-07-27", "authors": ["S MAmr", "A Oel-Mofty", "S NAmin"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2001-15123"}
{"title": "Ribonucleases and their antitumor activity.", "abstract": "The antitumor effect of ribonucleases was studied with animal ribonucleolytic enzymes, bovine pancreatic RNase A, bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase), onconase and angiogenin. While bovine pancreatic RNase A exerts a minor antitumor effect, BS-RNase and onconase exert significant effects. Angiogenin, as RNase, works in an opposite way, it initiates vascularization of tumors and subsequent tumor growth. Ribonunclease inhibitors are not able to inhibit the antitumor effectiveness of BS-RNase or onconase. However, they do so in the case of pancreatic RNases. Conjugation of BS-RNase with antibodies against tumor antigens (preparation of immunotoxins) like the conjugation of the enzyme with polymers enhances the antitumor activity of the ribonuclease. After conjugation with polymers, the half-life of BS-RNase in blood is extended and its immunogenicity reduced. Recombinant RNases have the same functional activity as the native enzymes. The synthetic genes have also been modified, some of them with gene sequences typical for the BS-RNase parts. Recent experimental efforts are directed to the preparation of 'humanized antitumor ribonuclease' that would be structurally similar to human enzyme with minimal immunogenicity and side effects. The angiogenesis of tumors is attempted to be minimized by specific antibodies or anti-angiogenic substances.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

We have studied the repair of infarcted myocardium in mice using highly enriched stem/progenitor cells from adult bone marrow. The left coronary artery was ligated and 5 hours later Lin- c-kit+ bone marrow cells obtained from transgenic male mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were injected into the healthy myocardium adjacent to the site of the infarct. After 9 days the damaged hearts were examined for regenerating myocardium. A band of new myocardium was observed in 12 surviving mice. The developing myocytes were small and resembled fetal and neonatal myocytes. They were positive for EGFP, Y chromosome, and several myocyte-specific proteins including cardiac myosin, and the transcription factors GATA-4, MEF2, and Csx/Nkx2.5. The cells were also positive for connexin 43, a gap junction/intercalated disc component indicating the onset of intercellular communication. Myocyte proliferation was demonstrated by incorporation of BrdU into the DNA of dividing cells and by the presence of the cell cycle-associated protein K167 in their nuclei. Neo-vascularization was also observed in regenerating myocardium. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells in developing capillaries and small arterioles were EGFP-positive. These cells were positive for Factor VIII and alpha smooth muscle actin, respectively. No myocardial regeneration was observed in damaged hearts transplanted with Lin- c-kit- bone marrow cells, which lack bone marrow-regenerating activity.

{"title": "Multiple growth factors regulate coronary embryonic vasculogenesis.", "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating coronary vascularization are not well understood. To test hypotheses regarding the influence of key growth factors and their interactions, we studied vascular tube formation (vasculogenesis) in collagen gels onto which quail embryonic ventricles were placed and incubated in the presence of growth factors or inhibitors. Vasculogenesis in this model is dependent on tyrosine kinase receptors, since tube formation was totally blocked by genestein. Tube formation was attenuated when anti-bFGF or anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies were added to the medium and nearly completely inhibited when the both were added. The attenuation associated with anti-VEGF was due primarily to a decrease in assembly of endothelial cells, while that associated with bFGF was primarily due to a reduction in endothelial cells. Soluble tie-2, the receptor for angiopoietins, also had an inhibitory effect and, when added with either anti-bFGF or anti-VEGF, markedly attenuated tube formation. At optimal doses, tube formation was enhanced 6.5-fold by bFGF and 2.5-fold by VEGF over the controls. Each of these growth factors was dependent upon the other for optimal induction of tube formation, since neutralizing antibodies to one markedly reduced the potency of the other. VEGF potency was also markedly reduced when soluble tie-2 was added to the medium. Tube formation was virtually totally blocked by exogenous TGF-beta at doses > 1 ng/ml, while neutralizing TGF-beta antibodies enhanced tube formation 2-fold in the 30 ng-30 microg range.

It is believed that angiogenic inhibitor(s) exist to inhibit the neo-vascularization of tumor, thus impeding the tumor growth. In this study, growth plate chondrocyte-derived TGFbeta1 was identified to be anti-angiogenic. It was found that growth plate chondrocytes (GPC) secreted TGFbeta1 mostly in latent form as demonstrated by gel filtration and immunoblotting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was followed to quantify TGFbeta1 in GPC conditioned medium (CM), in which 866 pg/ml of TGFbeta1 was found. Besides, the angiogenesis inhibitory effect of GPC CM was abolished by the addition of anti-TGFbeta1 antibody in the in vitro culture system and the in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. This confirmed the anti-angiogenic properties of chondrocyte-derived TGFbeta1. TGFbeta1 was expressed predominantly in the proliferative zone of porcine growth plate. This explains the low incidence of tumor invasion across the entire growth plate. Also, this helps to explain the observation that tumor invasion across the physis increases with age as the proliferative zone gradually disappears. J. Cell. Biochem.

We investigated the effects of angiostatin gene transfer in in vitro and in vivo models of KS-induced neovascularization and tumor growth. A eukaryotic expression plasmid and a Moloney leukemia virus-based retroviral vector for expression of murine angiostatin were generated harboring the angiostatin cDNA with cleavable leader signals under the control of either the strong cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer or the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat. Angiostatin secretion was confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Supernatants of angiostatin-transfected cells inhibited endothelial cell migration in vitro. Stable gene transfer of the angiostatin cDNA by retroviral vectors in KS-IMM cells resulted in sustained angiostatin expression and delayed tumor growth in nude mice, which was associated with reduced vascularization.

{"title": "VEGF as a mediator of tumor-associated immunodeficiency.", "abstract": "Decreased immune function in cancer patients is well-characterized (1), and tumor cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to avoid anti-tumor immune responses (2-8). One mechanism for inhibition of immune cell function by tumors is the production of soluble factors, such as IL- 10, TNF, TGF-beta, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The effects of these factors appear to be twofold: To inhibit effector function and to impair the development of immune cells by acting on earlier stages of immunopoiesis. Immune suppression by tumors is accomplished by a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms, and virtually all branches of the immune system can be affected. VEGF and its receptors have profound effects on the early development and differentiation of both vascular endothelial and hematopoetic progenitors (9). It induces proliferation of mature endothelial cells and is an important component in the formation of tumor neovasculature (10). VEGF is abundantly expressed by a large percentage of solid tumors and this over-expression is closely associated with a poor prognosis (11,12). Some of the earliest hematopoetic progenitors express receptors for VEGF (13), and we have demonstrated that VEGF causes a defect in the functional maturation of dendritic cells (DC) from progenitors. This developmental defect is associated with impaired activation of NF-kappaB (14-17).

The high expression of u-PA by hEMVEC was also found in tissue sections. hEMVEC formed capillary-like structures when cultured in 20% human serum on top of three-dimensional fibrin matrices, and VEGF-A or basic fibroblast growth factor increased this tube formation. This is in contrast with hFMVEC, which formed tubes only after simultaneous stimulation by a growth factor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The high basal level of u-PA contributes to and may explain the higher angiogenic properties of hEMVEC (in vitro).", "journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "date": "2001-07-10", "authors": ["PKoolwijk", "KKapiteijn", "BMolenaar", "Evan Spronsen", "Bvan der Vecht", "F MHelmerhorst", "V Wvan Hinsbergh"], "doi": "10.1210/jcem.86.7.7651"}
{"title": "Number and migratory activity of circulating endothelial progenitor cells inversely correlate with risk factors for coronary artery disease.", "abstract": "Recent studies provide increasing evidence that postnatal neovascularization involves bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The regulation of EPCs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear at present. Therefore, we determined the number and functional activity of EPCs in 45 patients with CAD and 15 healthy volunteers. The numbers of isolated EPCs and circulating CD34/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)-positive precursor cells were significantly reduced in patients with CAD by approximately 40% and 48%, respectively. To determine the influence of atherosclerotic risk factors, a risk factor score including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, positive family history of CAD, and LDL cholesterol levels was used. The number of risk factors was significantly correlated with a reduction of EPC levels (R=-0.394, P=0.002) and CD34-/KDR-positive cells (R=-0.537, P<0.001). Analysis of the individual risk factors demonstrated that smokers had significantly reduced levels of EPCs (P<0.001) and CD34-/KDR-positive cells (P=0.003). Moreover, a positive family history of CAD was associated with reduced CD34-/KDR-positive cells (P=0.011). Most importantly, EPCs isolated from patients with CAD also revealed an impaired migratory response, which was inversely correlated with the number of risk factors (R=-0.484, P=0.002). By multivariate analysis, hypertension was identified as a major independent predictor for impaired EPC migration (P=0.043). The present study demonstrates that patients with CAD revealed reduced levels and functional impairment of EPCs, which correlated with risk factors for CAD. Given the important role of EPCs for neovascularization of ischemic tissue, the decrease of EPC numbers and activity may contribute to impaired vascularization in patients with CAD.

Capillary surface area density and total capillary surface area were decreased in both iron-restricted groups compared with the control group. Capillary length density was decreased in both iron-restricted groups compared with the control group. Total capillary length was significantly reduced in the 1-week, but not in the 2-week, iron-restricted group compared with the control group. Endothelial cell volume was increased in both iron-restricted groups compared to the controls. There were no significant differences in the volume of fetal capillaries, the volume of the maternal blood spaces or the surface area of the maternal-fetal interface between the control and iron-restricted groups. Labyrinthine volume, labyrinthine tissue volume and the surface area of the maternal fetal interface were increased in the 2-week group when compared with the 1-week group.

Ninety-eight percent of all cases showed expression of VEGF, and higher expression was found significantly more frequent in thinner and less vascularized tumors. Possible autocrine loops were suggested by co-expression of VEGF and its two receptors in tumor cells, and by a significant correlation between KDR and tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67) in the subgroup of thicker tumors. Staining of VEGF receptors in endothelium was not correlated with MVD. Strong expression of TSP-1 in tumor stroma was found in 43% of the primary tumors, and was significantly correlated with increased thickness, proliferation and MVD, as well as decreased survival.

{"title": "Procoagulants in fetus rejection: the role of the OX-2 (CD200) tolerance signal.", "abstract": "The spontaneous loss of normal karyotype embryos may be initiated or prevented by the maternal immune system. In mice, loss between the time of implantation (day 4.5) and formation of a vascularized placenta (day 9.5) when the embryo is too large to survive by diffusion alone, is analogous to occult pregnancy failure in humans. They are called occult because usually the woman does not know she is pregnant. From studies in mice, these early losses have a different mechanism than abortion of a vascularized placenta (analogous to clinically evident human spontaneous miscarriage). The latter depend on the activation of the novel prothrombinase fgl2 on the fetal trophoblast and in maternal decidua by the T helper-1 (Th1) type cytokines TNF- alpha+gamma -interferon that arise from NK cells and NK gammadelta T cells; conversion of prothrombin to thrombin which in turn generates IL8 that activates polymorphonuclear leukocytes leads to embryonic death. These inflammatory processes are counteracted by Th2/3-type cytokines that arise in part from V gamma 1 delta 6 T cells reacting to, as yet, unidentified trophoblast antigens in the presence of the 'tolerance signaling molecule' OX-2. By contrast, peri-implantation losses (between implantation and formation of a vascularized placenta, analogous to occult losses in humans) appear to be dependent upon perforin(+)cells, complement activation, and products of alphabeta T and NK alphabeta T cells, but not on TNF- alpha or procoagulant activation.

Long-term acceptance of semi-identical liver allograft was obtained by a transient course of FK506. In a subgroup of six animals, three developed a lethal PTLD. These animals were studied by histology and immunohistochemistry and the anti-donor cellular immune response was assessed. In addition, the possible viral origin of the proliferative process was evoked.\nHistology and immunohistochemistry revealed an abnormal B-cell proliferation in many organs of swine suffering from PTLD. Evidence of human Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus was not evidenced, but a porcine virus responsible for a respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS) was identified in the lymphoid tissue of these animals. In mixed lymphocyte reaction, a significant antiself immune response confirmed an infection by a virus.\nThis is the first report suggesting that PRRS virus might provoke PTLD in immunosuppressed miniature swine after orthotopic liver transplantation.

However, natural antibodies (NAbs) against Galalpha1,3Gal (Gal) pose an additional major barrier to pig-to-human vascularized xenograft acceptance.\nTo determine whether the mixed chimerism approach could also overcome this humoral barrier, T cell-depleted rat (GalT+/+) bone marrow cells (BMC) were transplanted to alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase deficient (GalT-/-) mice conditioned with a nonmyeloablative regimen, consisting of transient T cell and natural killer (NK) cell depletion, 3 Gy whole body irradiation, and 7 Gy thymic irradiation.\nBy giving a high dose (180x106) of rat BMC, persistent mixed chimerism could be induced in GalT-/- mice, although the level of donor-type hematopoietic repopulation declined over time. Induction of mixed chimerism was associated with a rapid disappearance of anti-Gal and anti-rat NAb in the sera. Both anti-Gal Ab-producing cells and B cells with receptors recognizing Gal were undetectable in mixed chimeras, even when the chimerism levels declined, suggesting that a very low level of chimerism could effectively maintain B-cell tolerance to Gal, probably by clonal deletion and/or receptor editing. Mixed chimeras accepted subsequently transplanted donor-type rat hearts (>100 days) without immunosuppressive therapy, whereas delayed vascular and even hyperacute rejection of rat hearts occurred in conditioned control GalT-/- mice. Cellular rejection occurred by 5-6 days in conditioned control wild-type mice.\nThese findings demonstrate that induction of mixed chimerism with a nonmyeloablative regimen can prevent vascularized xenograft rejection by cellular and anti-Gal Ab-dependent pathways in GalT+/+-to-GalT-/- species combinations.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2001-07-04", "authors": ["HOhdan", "Y GYang", "K GSwenson", "HKitamura", "MSykes"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200106150-00009"}

Histological analysis revealed the presence of tissues derived from all three germ layers, in all tumors. However, alpha5-null teratocarcinomas displayed less undifferentiated tissue than did the controls. Decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis were observed in the undifferentiated areas of the alpha5-null teratocarcinomas. The expression of extracellular matrix proteins, fibronectin and tenascin-C, and the basement membrane components, laminin, entactin/nidogen, and collagen IV, was similar in the different tumors, although the deposition of these molecules was more disorganized in alpha5-null teratocarcinomas. The absence of alpha5-integrin in the various tissues of the alpha5-null tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Many vessels, but not all, stained positively for alpha5-integrin, showing that they were host derived. Analysis of the area occupied by vessels revealed, on average, an 8-fold decrease in alpha5-null teratocarcinomas compared with control tumors. Staining for smooth muscle alpha-actin showed that pericytes and smooth muscle cells were recruited around the vessels in all tumors, suggesting similar vessel differentiation. Deposition of EIIIA and EIIIB and fibronectin around the vessels was observed in all tumors. The fact that some, although few, alpha5-integrin-negative vessels existed in alpha5-null tumors indicated that alpha5-/- ES cells could differentiate into endothelial cells. Endothelial cell differentiation and vessel formation were analyzed also in vitro. alpha5-null ES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies, although they were delayed in growth and attachment. Differentiation into endothelial cells was achieved, but the organization into a complex vasculature was delayed compared with controls.

We adopted this transverse design and transferred myocutaneous gracilis flaps measuring up to 17 x 9 cm.

The rationale was to create within the wound space an optimal microenvironment, conducive to cellular proliferation, vascular granulation tissue formation, and epithelialization. This study was performed on various wounds that failed to respond to previous conventional treatments.A total of 288 wounds were within the inclusion criteria, with only contaminated and neoplastic wounds excluded. Most of the patients (80 percent) were ambulatory, and the wounds were examined by the attending physician once every 7 to 14 days at an outpatient clinic. The remaining 20 percent of patients were admitted to the study while hospitalized. Cell culture medium MCDB, supplemented with insulin, thyroxin, and growth hormone, was gelled. The gel was self-applied once a day to freshly washed wounds, covered with a gauze pad, and anchored with netting. Healing started 7 to 14 days after the initiation of treatment with enriched cell culture medium. However, the criterion for success of the treatment was determined on complete wound closure, which was achieved in 189 of 288 wounds (65.6 percent). Wound closure was correlated with the initial wound volume, stage, and origin. The average time required for closure of wounds caused by systemic pathologies (n = 181) and those based on regional status (n = 107) were 12.0 and 4.4 weeks, respectively, compared with 290 and 10.3 weeks of the previous conventional treatment. In 19 extensive wounds, when vascularized granulation tissue was established, a successful surgical closure was attained. Most wounds of patients who did not continue the enriched cell culture medium treatment (34.4 percent) manifested reduced wound volume, ranging from 11 to 98 percent of initial volume.

Over a period of 25 months, the authors used Integra to cover 30 anatomic sites in 20 consecutive patients requiring reconstructive surgery and then analyzed the clinical and histologic outcomes. The most common reason for surgery was release of contracture followed by resurfacing of tight or painful scars. The authors assessed patients' satisfaction using a visual analog scale and scar appearance using a modified Vancouver Burn Index Scale. They evaluated the progress of wound healing by examining weekly punch-biopsy specimens with standard and immunohistochemical stains. Patients reported a 72 percent increase in range of movement, a 62 percent improvement in softness, and a 59 percent improvement in appearance compared with their preoperative states. Pruritus and dryness were the main complaints, and neither was improved much. Four distinct phases of dermal regeneration could be demonstrated histologically: imbibition, fibroblast migration, neovascularization, and remodeling and maturation. Full vascularization of the neodermis occurred at 4 weeks. The color of the wound reflected the state of neodermal vascularization. No adnexa, nerve endings, or elastic fibers were seen in any of the specimens. The new collagen was histologically indistinguishable from normal dermal collagen. The authors conclude that Integra is a useful tool in reconstructive surgery. The additional cost of its use can be justified by its distinct benefits compared with current methodology.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2001-06-23", "authors": ["N SMoiemen", "J JStaiano", "N OOjeh", "YThway", "J DFrame"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200107000-00015"}

The authors demonstrate examples of successful reconstruction for a prosthetic eye that provided adequate and aesthetic soft-tissue support achieved by applying a three-step surgical procedure of reconstruction of the eye socket, the eyelids, and the tarsus and eyelid margin. Because it is highly vascularized and its distal end can be divided into two or three portions for easy three-dimensional reconstruction, the expanded forehead flap alone, with a galea flap, or with a free rectus abdominis muscle perforator flap was used. The expanded forehead flap also provides excellent thin upper lid contour and good color-matching with a recipient site. For the eye socket, sufficient volume of tissue was provided from the expanded forehead flap with or without a galea or a free rectus abdominis muscle perforator flap, and a deep and convex fornix was formed. This resulted in a good fit and in stability of the ocular prosthesis. The surface and the inner lining of the eyelids were reconstructed using portions of the expanded forehead flap. For the tarsus and eyelid margin, conventional reconstruction techniques use cartilage of the concha, which has limitations of length and which does not fit the shape of the tarsal margin.

However, the authors have previously found that intraarterial vasodilators actually reduce collateral blood flow acutely, by preferentially dilating the vasculature of adjacent, nonischemic mesenteric vascular beds, a phenomenon well established in other organs.\nA segment of rat ileum was acutely devascularized, with blood flow provided only by collateral arterial vessels from adjacent, nonischemic bowel. Papaverine (30 or 40 microg/kg/min), isoproterenol (0.06 microg/kg/min), norepinephrine (0.1 or 0.2 microg/kg/min), or vehicle saline was continuously infused into the cranial (superior) mesenteric artery for 48 hours. Viability was then assessed using previously established, objective gross and microscopic criteria.\nAlthough papaverine increased total mesenteric blood flow in normally vascularized rats, it not only failed to improve but actually significantly reduced the length of the devascularized segment maintained viable by collateral blood flow after 48 hours. Isoproterenol had a similar effect. Norepinephrine infusion decreased both normal mesenteric blood flow and viable segment length.\nThese findings suggest that intraarterial vasodilator therapy fails to improve intestinal viability after segmental mesenteric vascular occlusion.", "journal": "Annals of surgery", "date": "2001-06-23", "authors": ["J EMeilahn", "J BMorris", "E PCeppa", "G BBulkley"], "doi": "10.1097/00000658-200107000-00016"}

The sensitivity of Levovist-enhanced color power Doppler was compared to that of standard color power Doppler and contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography (CT) in the detection of vascular signals in hepatocellular carcinoma.\nWe examined 29 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in cirrhotic livers that had appeared avascular on unenhanced color power Doppler. Color power Doppler studies were repeated with and without Levovist enhancement before (15 examinations) and/or after (23 examinations) percutaneous ablation procedures. Findings (vascularized vs nonvascularized) were compared to those obtained with contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography (gold standard) performed no more than 24 h after each of the 38 Doppler examinations.\nIn pretreatment studies, Levovist-enhanced power Doppler correctly revealed vascularization in 12 of 15 lesions that had appeared avascular without echo enhancement and confirmed the avascularity of one other nodule; the remaining two, which appeared avascular on contrast-enhanced Doppler, displayed vascularization on the spiral CT examination. Levovist-enhanced power Doppler was fully concordant with spiral CT findings in all of the posttreatment examinations.\nConsidering the absence of false positive results in this study, echo-enhanced color power Doppler can be considered reliable in diagnosing incomplete necrosis of hepatocellular carcinomas after percutaenous ablation.

Although both B7-1 and B7-2 bind CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells, the role of B7-1 and B7-2 signaling through CTLA-4 in regulating alloimmune responses is incompletely understood. To address this question, we transplanted CD28-deficient mice with fully allogeneic vascularized cardiac allografts and studied the effect of selective blockade of B7-1 or B7-2. These mice reject their grafts by a mechanism that involves both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Blockade of CTLA-4 or B7-1 significantly accelerated graft rejection. In contrast, B7-2 blockade significantly prolonged allograft survival and, unexpectedly, reversed the acceleration of graft rejection caused by CTLA-4 blockade. Furthermore, B7-2 blockade prolonged graft survival in recipients that were both CD28 and CTLA-4 deficient.

Changes in angiogenesis were quantified using bromodeoxyuridine to obtain a proliferation index, and CD31 immunocytochemistry to visualize endothelial cell area. Percentage of proliferating endothelial cells was calculated by double labeling for bromodeoxyuridine and CD31. Vascularization was first observed in follicles containing four granulosa cell layers. A significant increase in proliferation in the thecal layer was observed from the early to late secondary stage, and dual staining showed that 25% of proliferating cells were of endothelial cell origin. VEGF messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed in granulosa cells with an increase of grain density from late secondary to tertiary follicles. Ang-1 was weakly expressed in the theca of tertiary follicles. Ang-2 mRNA was not detected in any follicles. The mRNA for the Flt-1 and Tie-2 receptors was localized in endothelial cells of the theca. Unexpectedly, Tie-2 mRNA was also found in granulosa cells of early follicular stages and its translation was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. VEGF trap treatment for 3 days resulted in an 87% decrease of proliferation in the theca of secondary and tertiary follicles, a reduction in endothelial cell area and a marked decline in Flt-1 mRNA expression. Granulosa cell proliferation also decreased. These results show that onset and establishment of the follicle vasculature takes place early during follicular development.

Ultrasound contrast agents can be used to develop new, more effective vectors for gene delivery. Ultrasound contrast agents lower the threshold for cavitation by ultrasound energy. Using physical properties of microbubbles and coating materials, genetic drugs have been incorporated into ultrasound contrast agents. Gene-bearing microbubbles can be injected IV and ultrasound energy applied to the target region. As the microbubbles enter the region of insonation, the microbubbles cavitate, locally releasing DNA. Cavitation also likely causes a local shockwave that improves cellular uptake of DNA.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of postnatal growth retardation on the incidence and severity of acidosis-induced retinopathy.\n100 newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two expanded litters of 25 pups each and five standard control litters of 10 pups each. All rats were gavaged with 10 mM/kg NH(4)Cl twice daily from days two to seven. Following five days of recovery, retinal vasculature was assessed using ADPase staining, light microscopy, and computer-assisted image analysis. The presence of neovascularization (NV), severity of NV (clock hours), and vascularized retinal areas, were evaluated in a masked manner.\nNV occurred in 52% of rats in expanded litters versus 18% of rats in standard control litters (p = 0.005). Postnatal growth retardation of pups in expanded litters was confirmed by comparing total body weight of pups raised in expanded and standard control litters (10.8g vs 13.4g on day 8, p < 0.001; 20.8g vs 25.2g on day 13, p = 0.002).\nPostnatal growth retardation increases the incidence of acidosis-induced retinopathy in the neonatal rat. Our study provides further evidence that postnatal growth retardation is a risk factor for preretinal neovascularization in immature retinae and is consistent with the clinical observation that the smallest and sickest premature infants are more likely to suffer from ROP.", "journal": "Current eye research", "date": "2001-06-13", "authors": ["SZhang", "D ALeske", "W LLanier", "J MHolmes"], "doi": "10.1076/ceyr.22.2.133.5531"}

We sought to determine whether loss of PC-mediated activities might affect the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. Stable transfectants of alpha(1)-antitrypsin Portland (alpha(1)-PDX) cDNA, coding for a potent PC inhibitor, were analyzed in model HT-29 cells (HT-29/PDX) and in other cell lines. Expression of alpha(1)-PDX resulted in a proinsulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (pro-IGF-1R) processing blockade, hence inhibiting the ability of exogenous IGF-1 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of its beta-subunit and insulin-related substrate-1. Coexpression of IGF-1R with four different PCs or the novel convertase SKI-1 in the furin-defective LoVo-C5 cells demonstrated that pro-IGF-1R ( approximately 200 kDa) cleavage into IGF-1R (beta-subunit, approximately 105 kDa) can be achieved by furin and PC5A, but not by PACE4, PC7, or SKI-1. Expression of alpha(1)-PDX resulted in reduction of DNA synthesis and in anchorage-independent growth. Following serum deprivation, the alpha(1)-PDX transfectants exhibited an enhanced apoptotic phenotype and were insensitive to IGF-1-mediated [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and protection against apoptosis. These cells showed reduced invasiveness that paralleled decreased mRNA levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Comparative subcutaneous inoculation of cells in nude mice revealed that animals injected with HT-29/PDX cells exhibited delayed and lower incidence of tumor development as well as reduced tumor size. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 antigen expression, a marker of endothelial cells, revealed reduced HT-29/PDX tumor vascularization. These findings indicate that PCs actively contribute to the growth and malignant phenotypes of HT-29 tumors, suggesting that PC inhibition strategies may be a useful adduct to the arsenal of colorectal anticancer gene therapies.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2001-06-13", "authors": ["A MKhatib", "GSiegfried", "APrat", "JLuis", "MChr\u00e9tien", "PMetrakos", "N GSeidah"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M101725200"}

{"title": "Close-range shotgun and rifle injuries to the face.", "abstract": "The treatment of extensive shotgun and rifle injuries to the face is extremely difficult and demands experience in microsurgery and craniofacial surgery. Early aggressive surgery with immediate bone and soft tissue reconstruction is recommended for the management of extensive facial gunshot wounds. Experience has shown that early three-dimensional bone replacement can be achieved with bone grafts in the midfacial area if the bone grafts are covered with well-vascularized tissues. Large midfacial defects can be reconstructed safely and effectively with free-tissue transfers, including bone. In the acute stage, microvascular muscle flaps are preferred because of their good vascularity and good filling capacity. These flaps are able to cover the anterior cranial fossa. When vascularized bone is needed, the authors' first choice is a latissimus dorsi flap with scapular bone. Patients treated with an early and aggressive surgical strategy develop fewer problems in form of infection, contraction, scarring, and require fewer secondary corrections. Successful primary treatment allows the surgeon to use multiple modalities, including tissue expansion, free-tissue transfers, and local flaps in a noninfected environment. The treatment is rewarding, and the results are surprisingly good.

Ring preparations (diameter approximately 250 microm) of small femoral bone arteries from oophorectomized and sham-operated rabbits were mounted on a myograph six weeks postoperatively. Cumulative concentration response curves were obtained for various agonists at a normalized lumen diameter. Oophorectomy did not significantly influence lumen diameter, maximal response to high potassium, or maximal response to high potassium and 10(-5) M noradrenaline. However, OOX significantly increased the maximal response to noradrenaline (OOX 2.14 +/- 0.36 N/m, Sham 1.25 +/- 0.14 N/m) and endothelin-1 (OOX 1.76 +/- 0.32, Sham 0.95 +/- 0.15) in metaphyseal arteries. Moreover, the corresponding maximal active pressure for the agonists was significantly increased. OOX did not influence endothelial function assessed by the effects of acetylcholine or substance P. The functional responses of diaphyseal arteries were unaffected by OOX.

Resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were measured in order to monitor flow variations from the renal to the arcuate arteries. PD was used mainly to study the morphology of the cortical vessels. The examinations were performed on an Esaote Biomedica AU-4/5 (Genoa, Italy) using a convex 3.5 MHz probe and a linear 7.5 MHz probe. On the basis of clinical data the patients were divided into 3 groups: A) Normal, B) Acute graft dysfunction, C) Chronic allograft nephropathy. In 87 patients (20%) percutaneous biopsy or FNAB was performed. RI and PI mean values +/-SD were calculated and compared to the other diagnostic parameters considered: serum creatinine level, US morphology, CD and PD vascularization. Finally RI and PI for each group were compared using the t -test in order to determine the statistical significance of the correlation between these indices and the patients clinical conditions.\nThe 436 patients were divided as follows: Group A) 170 patients (39%); Group B) 105 patients (24%); Group C) 161 patients (37%). Urological and surgical complications were ruled out in all patients. RI and PI showed a similar trend exceeding cut-off values in Group B) and C) with highest peaks in Group B. Statistical analysis demonstrated the efficacy of this method in the differentiation between normal and pathological grafts, but there was a reduced statistical difference between the two pathological groups. Histological analysis performed on 87 patients (20%) showed good correlation with RI.\nCD is a non-invasive diagnostic method which provides flow-metric quantitative parameters for the hemodynamic assessment of the renal transplant. These values present a certain sensitivity but are not specific of renal graft dysfunction, as there is no reliable differentiation between acute rejection and other parenchymal pathologies. During the follow-up, RI and PI have no predictive value. RI variations from renal artery to cortical vessels (hylum-cortical ratio) show a good correlation with the clinical evolution of the transplant. The evaluation of RI and PI can generally be limited to renal and interlobar arteries as arcuate sampling is necessary only when the hylum-cortical ratio shows reduction or inversion.

Specimens from 11 healthy horses were examined. Corresponding to the high incidence of gastric lesions in the margo plicatus, special attention was paid to the differentiation between the pars nonglandularis and the margo plicatus as a distinct area of the aglandular mucosa. In both areas, the blood vessels of the lamina propria mucosae were arranged in three vascular layers; i. e. I) a basal, II) an intermediate, and III) a subepithelial horizontal level. In the basal (I) and in the intermediate (II) layers the vascular supply was organised in arterial retia-rete arteriosum profundum, rete arteriosum subpapillare- and venous plexus-plexus venosus profundus, plexus venosus subpapillare. Vertical interconnections integrated the layers into the vascular network of the entire lamina propria. The subepithelial (III) layer represented the blood vessels of all the individual connective tissue papillae in the lamina propria mucosae. Ansae capillares intrapapillares were found in the pars nonglandularis. In contrast, each of the papilla of the margo plicatus contained a \"cone shaped\" rete capillare intrapapillare. The thicker epithelium and lamina propria mucosae of the margo plicatus was therefore supplied by less numerous, but longer intrapapillary blood vessel systems.

{"title": "On the role of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the embryo-endometrial microenvironment: implications for differentiation and implantation.", "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in addition to its well-known endocrine effects on the corpus luteum, may act as a growth and differentiation factor during pregnancy. According to experimental results, its mode of action may be divided into three sequential phases. During the first phase, which begins at the blastocyst stage and lasts until the occurrence in the serum, hCG acts preferentially in a juxtacrine manner. We have used an intrauterine microdialysis system developed in our laboratory to administer low concentrations of hCG to the endometrium of women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. HCG administration provoked profound effects on paracrine parameters of differentiation (IGFBP-1, prolactin) and implantation (LIF, M-CSF). VEGF, a cytokine important for neoangiogenesis, was significantly stimulated by hCG (P < .01), suggesting a role for hCG in the control of endometrial vascularization and placentation. The investigation of endometrial parameters of tissue remodeling revealed a significant increase of MMP-9 (P < .05) but not of TIMP-1 following hCG infusion. The second, endocrine, phase of hCG action is marked by the appearance of hCG in the maternal serum. Rising systemic hCG levels cause a very rapid elevation of serum progesterone reflecting the rescue of the corpus luteum. Other endocrine functions of hCG include its intrinsic thyrotropic activity as well as modulation of fetal testicular, ovarian, and adrenal function. The third phase may be characterized by the expression of full-length hCG/LH receptors on the trophoblasts themselves. Before the ninth week of gestation, human villous trophoblasts express a truncated hCG/LH receptor isoform (50 kDa) and are probably not responsive to hCG. Later, the expression pattern is switched to the full-length receptor (80 kDa), allowing hCG also to modulate the differentiation of the trophoblasts themselves. A special feature is the self-regulation of hCG biosynthesis that may in part explain the unique secretion profile of the hormone with peak levels during the first trimester followed by a rapid decline after the tenth week of gestation. In summary, hCG seems to have a variety of local and systemic functions in and outside the embryo-endometrial microenvironment.", "journal": "Seminars in reproductive medicine", "date": "2001-06-08", "authors": ["PLicht", "VRussu", "LWildt"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2001-13909"}

The identification of promoters that are preferentially active in cancer cells is the starting point for this strategy. The combination of tissue-specific and tumor-specific elements offers the possibility to artificially develop such promoters. We describe the construction and characterization of a hybrid promoter for transcriptional targeting of breast cancer. In many cases, breast cancer cells retain the expression of estrogen receptors, and most solid tumors suffer from hypoxia as a consequence of their aberrant vascularization. Estrogen response elements and hypoxia-responsive elements were combined to activate transcription in cells that present at least one of these characteristics. When a promoter containing these elements is used to control the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene harakiri, the induction of cell death can be activated by estrogens and hypoxia, and inhibited by antiestrogens such as tamoxifen. Finally, we show evidence that these properties are maintained in the context of an adenoviral vector (AdEHhrk). Therefore, infection with this virus preferentially kills estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, or cells growing under hypoxic conditions. We propose the use of this promoter for transcriptional targeting of breast cancer.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2001-06-08", "authors": ["RHernandez-Alcoceba", "MPihalja", "GNunez", "M FClarke"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700304"}

Organs from CBA donors (H-2k) were transplanted into BALB/c (H-2d) hosts with wild-type (WT) or disrupted (GKO, BALB/c mice with disrupted IFN-gamma genes) IFN-gamma genes. In WT hosts, rejecting hearts and kidneys showed mononuclear cell infiltration, intense induction of donor MHC products, but little parenchymal necrosis at day 7. Rejecting allografts in GKO recipients showed infiltrate but little or no induction of donor MHC and developed extensive necrosis despite patent large vessels. The necrosis was immunologically mediated, since it developed during rejection, was absent in isografts, and was prevented by immunosuppressing the recipient with cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil. Rejecting kidneys in GKO hosts showed increased mRNA for heme oxygenase 1, and decreased mRNA for NO synthase 2 and monokine inducible by IFN-gamma (MIG). The mRNA levels for CTL genes (perforin, granzyme B, and Fas ligand) were similar in rejecting kidneys in WT and GKO hosts, and the host Ab responses were similar. The administration of recombinant IFN-gamma to GKO hosts reduced but did not fully prevent the effects of IFN-gamma deficiency: MHC was induced, but the prevention of necrosis and induction of MIG were incomplete compared with WT hosts. Thus, IFN-gamma has unique effects in vascularized allografts, including induction of MHC and MIG, and protection against parenchymal necrosis, probably at the level of the microcirculation.

Although the mechanism of angiostatin action remains unknown, identification of F(1)-F(O) ATP synthase as the major angiostatin-binding site on the endothelial cell surface suggests that ATP metabolism may play a role in the angiostatin response. Previous studies noting the presence of F(1) ATP synthase subunits on endothelial cells and certain cancer cells did not determine whether this enzyme was functional in ATP synthesis. We now demonstrate that all components of the F(1) ATP synthase catalytic core are present on the endothelial cell surface, where they colocalize into discrete punctate structures. The surface-associated enzyme is active in ATP synthesis as shown by dual-label TLC and bioluminescence assays. Both ATP synthase and ATPase activities of the enzyme are inhibited by angiostatin as well as by antibodies directed against the alpha- and beta-subunits of ATP synthase in cell-based and biochemical assays. Our data suggest that angiostatin inhibits vascularization by suppression of endothelial-surface ATP metabolism, which, in turn, may regulate vascular physiology by established mechanisms.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a huge mass, markedly enhanced in and around the right anterior clinoid process, which extended to the orbit and middle cranial fossa. Cerebral angiography revealed a richly vascular tumor fed by branches of both the right external and internal carotid arteries. A presumptive diagnosis of meningioma or hemangiopericytoma was considered.\nThe tumor was exposed through an orbitozygomatic approach. At surgery, the tumor was grossly firm to hard and had destroyed the dura, orbital roof, anterior clinoid process, temporal bone, and muscle. Histological analysis revealed that the tumor was composed of spindle-cell proliferation in a collagen-rich background, but it exhibited regional variations. The vascular network demonstrated irregular vascular lumina with a \"hemangiopericytoma-like\" pattern. Histological features included high cellularity and a high degree of pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor demonstrated diffuse positive staining for CD34 and vimentin. The tumor displayed no positive staining for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, glial fibrillary antigenic protein, S-100 protein, and factor XIII.\nMeningeal solitary fibrous tumor is considered a unique pathological entity.

The in vitro angiogenic potential of culture supernatant of AML cells was assessed using endothelial cell (EC) migration and proliferation assays. Increased EC migration and EC proliferation was induced in 7/20 and 19/20 AML supernatents respectively. The degree of in vivo neovascularization did not correlate with the ability of AML cells to stimulate in vitro endothelial cell migration and/or proliferation. This might be in part a result of the heterogeneous pattern of angiogenic factors produced by AML cells. The expression of different angiogenic factors was studied using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cells from 17/20 AML patients showed wide variation in spontaneous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, 4/19 expressed varied spontaneous blastic fibroblast growth factor mRNA levels and all patient samples showed spontaneous interleukin 8 mRNA expression. All AML samples expressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and/or MMP-9. VEGF mRNA expression correlated well with protein level (P = 0.006). A correlation was found between the degree of VEGF expression and neoangiogenesis (correlation coefficient = 0.448, P = 0.05).

In recent years, it has become apparent that PCOS is also associated with hyperinsulinemia that is probably central to the pathogenesis of PCOS. As a peculiar vascular pattern has been reported to be present in PCOS, the aim of this study was to investigate intraovarian stromal vascularization in PCOS patients and its possible correlation with sex hormones, gonadotropins and insulin levels. Twenty-eight oligomenorrheic or amenorrheic patients with PCOS and 14 eumenorrheic women with a PCOS-like ovarian pattern undergoing endocrine screening and ultrasound color Doppler intraovarian blood flow were recruited to the study. Ten healthy women with regular menses represented the control group. Hormonal assays (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), androstenedione, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and estradiol), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), baseline and glucose-induced insulin levels, and transvaginal ultrasonographic and color Doppler analysis (pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI) and velocity (Vmax) of ovarian stromal flow) were performed in all participants in the early proliferative phase. Endocrine values showed significant differences in PCOS patients compared with PCOS-like women and controls, while PI and RI indices were significantly higher in controls. PCOS patients were divided into hyperinsulinemic (n = 16) and normoinsulinemic (n = 12). Androstenedione was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the hyperinsulinemic than in the normoinsulinemic patients and controls, while SHBG was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in the hyperinsulinemic group. Analysis of color Doppler intraovarian vascularization showed a significantly lower RI and a higher Vmax in the hyperinsulinemic subjects than in the normoinsulinemic PCOS patients and controls. An increased stromal blood flow was observed in the PCOS and PCOS-like patients by transvaginal color Doppler evaluation, but this technique is not able to differentiate these two similar ovarian patterns. However, hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients had an increased vascularity of the ovarian stroma.

Heterotopic neurons are found mainly in the normally cell-sparse layer I within the cerebral hemispheres of dr(J) homozygotes. Neu-N immunostaining confirms the neuronal nature of these heterotopic cells, while bromodeoxyuridine-birthdating shows that the misplaced neurons are generated predominantly during the late stages of corticogenesis (E15-E17), suggesting an over-migration of neurons destined for layer II. Immunohistochemistry for laminin, and staining of reticulin fibres, reveals disruption of the glial limiting membrane specifically overlying the areas of heterotopic neurons. Factor VIII (von Willebrand factor) staining shows an abnormal vascular network in layer I, associated with the fragmented glial limiting membrane. Layer I astrocytes, recognized by immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, exhibit attachment of their end feet to the fragmented glial limiting membrane.

We used trypsin digestion to isolate the intact vascular network from retinas obtained postmortem from nine diabetic donors (age 64 +/- 11 years, duration of diabetes 6 +/- 4 years; mean +/- SD) and eight age-matched nondiabetic donors. Topographically matched sectors (each one-sixth of retina) of diabetic and nondiabetic retinas were tested sequentially with antibodies to fibrin cross-linking factor XIII and platelet glycoprotein (GP)-IIIa to identify fibrin-platelet thrombi. In some trypsin digests, we also examined vascular cell apoptosis. The retina from a nondiabetic donor, 24 years of age, who had died of trauma, was used to exclude confounding influences caused by the postmortem period. When compared with those of nondiabetic donors, the retinas of diabetic donors showed double the number of capillary segments with colocalized immunostaining for factor XIII and GPIIIa (P = 0.02). The total area of the positive segments was fourfold greater in the diabetic than in the nondiabetic donors (P = 0.02) and correlated with the duration of diabetes (r = 0.71, P < 0.05). Large thrombi were six times more frequent in the diabetic donors (P = 0.03), and there was a significant topographical association of microthrombosis with apoptotic cells in both diabetic and nondiabetic vessels (P = 0.0001).

The lack of predictability of successful fracture union and prognostic discrepancies of historic and contemporary classifications may be related to subtle differences of the internal vascular architecture of each scaphoid. Because the possibility of impaired vascularity is greater with fractures located in the proximal third, stable internal fixation is indicated to provide mechanical stability and fracture surface contact to enhance revascularization. Improved healing rates in a shorter time and earlier rehabilitation with percutaneous techniques of internal fixation have produced a clear shift from classic conservative treatment to internal skeletal fixation.

The peroneus brevis muscle is ideally located to provide coverage of the exposed distal fibula.\nAn anatomic dissection of the peroneus brevis muscle and its vascular pedicles was performed in 10 fresh cadaveric leg specimens. Patients who underwent this procedure at our institution were retrospectively reviewed.\nEach dissected muscle had an average of 3.5 vascular pedicles (range, 2-6), which arose from the peroneal artery in all but two cases. The average distance of the distal pedicle from the tip of the lateral malleolus was 6.7 cm (range, 3.5-12.0 cm). The muscle belly ended an average of 6.0 mm proximal to the tip of the lateral malleolus. Half of the specimens had muscle bellies that extended to or past the tip of the lateral malleolus. This rotation flap has been successful in covering four wounds with exposed distal fibula in four patients.\nThe anatomic characteristics of the peroneus brevis muscle are ideal for soft tissue coverage of the distal fibula. Ease of elevation and reliability have made this rotational flap the procedure of choice for small soft tissue defects over the distal fibula at our institution.", "journal": "The Journal of trauma", "date": "2001-05-24", "authors": ["T PMcHenry", "J SEarly", "T GSchacherer"], "doi": "10.1097/00005373-200105000-00025"}

{"title": "Vaginal reconstruction/fistulae.", "abstract": "Vaginal reconstruction is required in congenital absence of the vagina in the paediatric population and in patients with surgical (anterior exenteration) or traumatic loss of the vagina. Although vaginal agenesis is rare, its description and attempts at replacement vaginoplasty date back to antiquity. Different forms of vaginal reconstruction are described, including the use of split-thickness or full-thickness grafts, amnion, peritoneum or bowel. Experience with bowel segments for vaginoplasty, with few complications and high success rates, have expanded the indications for this technique, rendering it of great importance in the field of vaginal reconstruction, especially when large bowel segments are utilized. Most vaginal fistulae occur after gynaecological surgery. There is a multitude of established techniques for closure of vaginal fistulae with comparable success rates, and two different approaches (vaginal or abdominal) may be used. Preferable for complicated or recurrent fistulae is the abdominal approach because a well vascularized pedicled omentum majus flap can be interposed. Postirradiation fistulae, although rare, represent a challenge for the reconstructive surgeon. Fistula excision and closure fails in a high percentage of patients, and in cases of additional bladder and vaginal shrinkage urinary continence can only be achieved by urinary diversion.", "journal": "Current opinion in urology", "date": "2001-05-24", "authors": ["DFilipas"], "doi": "10.1097/00042307-200105000-00004"}

Here, we show that all of 30 melanoma cell lines secreted monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), whereas normal melanocytes did not. When low MCP-1-producing melanoma cells from a biologically early, nontumorigenic stage were transduced to overexpress the MCP-1 gene, tumor formation depended on the level of chemokine secretion and monocyte infiltration; low-level MCP-1 secretion with modest monocyte infiltration resulted in tumor formation, whereas high secretion was associated with massive monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the tumor mass, leading to its destruction within a few days after injection into mice. Tumor growth stimulated by monocytes/macrophages was due to increased angiogenesis. Vessel formation in vitro was inhibited with mAbs against TNF-alpha, which, when secreted by cocultures of melanoma cells with human monocytes, induced endothelial cells under collagen gels to form branching, tubular structures. These studies demonstrate that the biological effects of tumor-derived MCP-1 are biphasic, depending on the level of secretion. This correlates with the degree of monocytic cell infiltration, which results in increased tumor vascularization and TNF-alpha production.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2001-05-22", "authors": ["MNesbit", "HSchaider", "T HMiller", "MHerlyn"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.166.11.6483"}

{"title": "Enhanced invasion and tumor growth of fibroblast growth factor 8b-overexpressing MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8) is a secreted heparin-binding protein, which has mitogenic and transforming activity. Increased expression of FGF-8 has been found in human breast cancer, and it has a potential autocrine role in its progression. Human FGF-8 is alternatively spliced to generate four protein isoforms (a, b, e, and f). Isoform b has been shown to be the most transforming. In this work, we studied the role of FGF-8b in the growth (in vitro and in vivo) of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which proliferate in an estrogen-dependent manner. Constitutive overexpression of FGF-8b in MCF-7 cells down-regulated FGF-8b-binding receptors FGF receptor (FGFR) 1IIIc, FGFR2IIIc, and FGFR4 found to be expressed in these cells. FGF-8b overexpression led to an increase in the anchorage-independent proliferation rate in suspension culture and colony formation in soft agar, when MCF-7 cells were cultured with or without estradiol. FGF-8b also provided an additional growth advantage for cells stimulated with estradiol. In addition, FGF-8b-transfected cells invaded more actively through Matrigel than did control cells. This was possibly due to the increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9. In vivo, FGF-8b-transfected MCF-7 cells formed faster growing tumors than vector-only-transfected cells when xenografted into nude mice. The tumors formed by FGF-8b-transfected cells were more vascular than the tumors formed by vector-only-transfected cells. In conclusion, FGF-8b expression confers a growth advantage to MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to stimulation of proliferation, this growth advantage probably arises from increased invasion and tumor vascularization induced by FGF-8b. The results suggest that FGF-8b signaling may be an important factor in the regulation of tumorigenesis and progression of human breast cancer.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2001-05-19", "authors": ["J KRuohola", "T PViitanen", "E MValve", "J ASepp\u00e4nen", "N TLoponen", "J JKeskitalo", "P TLakkakorpi", "P LH\u00e4rk\u00f6nen"], "doi": null}

This prompted us to examine the 3D vascular network of normal colon mucosa, adenomas and invasive carcinomas by means of quantitative microvascular corrosion casting. Fresh hemicolectomy specimens from 20 patients undergoing cancer or polyposis coli surgery were used for corrosion casting, factor VIII and VEGF immunostaining. In addition, immunostaining was done on colorectal tissue from 33 patients with metastatic and non-metastatic carcinomas, polyposis coli and adenomas. This first quantitative analysis of intervessel and interbranching distances, branching angles and vessel diameters in human cancer specimens revealed distinct patterns of the microvascular unit in the tumour centre and periphery. Irrespective of the tumour localization and grading all individual tumours displayed qualitatively and quantitatively the same vascular architecture. This gives further evidence for the existence of a tumour type-specific vascular architecture as recently demonstrated for experimental tumours. Metastatic tumours displayed different vascular architectures only within hot spots, in terms of smaller intervascular distances than in non-metastatic tumours. Pre-cancerous lesions have in part virtually the same vascular architecture like invasive carcinomas. Comparison of VEGF immunostaining also suggests that angiogenesis sets in long before the progress towards invasive phenotypes and that the so-called angiogenic switch is more likely a sequence of events.", "journal": "British journal of cancer", "date": "2001-05-18", "authors": ["M AKonerding", "EFait", "AGaumann"], "doi": "10.1054/bjoc.2001.1809"}
{"title": "Diagnostic techniques in assessing vessels of the gastrointestinal tract.", "abstract": "Vascular disorders of the gastrointestinal tract include a variety of different underlying diseases, thus requiring different and, in many cases, more than one imaging procedure. Only a knowledge of the newest developments in vascular imaging techniques with all the possibilities and limits will ensure a time- and cost-effective, accurate and reliable diagnosis. In many acute cases and also as a screening procedure, ultrasound in combination with colour Doppler and duplex sonography, plays an important role in setting the right course for further imaging techniques, and can provide the correct diagnosis in many cases.Depending on the most prominent symptoms and the expected disease, the right choice of technique saves valuable time. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are cross-sectional imaging techniques that not only demonstrate lesion vascularization, but also provide information about neighbouring structures and complications in an understandable and demonstrable way. The use of angiography as an invasive tool should be limited to cases where a high temporal and spatial resolution is necessary to make the diagnosis or where therapeutic interventions are also likely to be performed within the same setting. For the diagnosis of gastrointestinal vascular diseases, often no generally valid recommendation can be given, since the impact of all imaging techniques will depend on the examiner's experience, the technical equipment and on their 24-h availability in a hospital.

In total, 40 patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases involving the retina were enrolled; 30 of them were treated with Pycnogenol and 10 with placebo. The results demonstrated a beneficial effect of Pycnogenol on the progression of retinopathy. Without any treatment (placebo) the retinopathy progressively worsened during the trial and the visual acuity significantly decreased; on the contrary, the Pycnogenol-treated patients showed no deterioration of retinal function and a significant recovery of visual acuity was also obtained. The fluorangiography showed an improvement of retinal vascularization and a reduced endothelial permeability and leakage in the Pycnogenol, but not in the placebo-treated, patients. The ophthalmoscopy and the electroretinogram (ERG) also confirmed the beneficial effects of Pycnogenol. The mechanism of action of Pycnogenol may be related to its free radical (FR) scavenging, anti-inflammatory and capillary protective activities.

We examined the gene expression of IL-10/IL-10 receptor and various angiogenic/angioinhibitory factors in 95 NSCLC samples to determine the correlation between IL-10 production and vascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin [Ang (Ang-1 and Ang-2)], thrombospondin, brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (KDR and flt-1), and Ang receptor (TIE2) gene expression were evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR. The cellular localization of these factors and vascularity in the cancer stroma were examined immunohistochemically. Seventy-eight (82.1%) and 93 (97.9%) of these 95 NSCLCs were positive for IL-10 and IL-10 receptor, respectively.

{"title": "The epidermal growth factor receptor as a target for cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors are expressed at high levels in about one third of epithelial cancers, and autocrine activation of EGF receptors appears to be critical for the growth of many tumors. We hypothesized that blockade of the binding sites for EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha on EGF receptors with an antireceptor monoclonal antibody (mAb) might be an effective anti-cancer therapy. We produced murine mAb 225 against EGF receptors and demonstrated blockade of receptor function, as well as inhibition of cell growth in cultures and in nude mouse xenografts. mAb C225 is the human:murine chimeric version of mAb 225. Cell cycle inhibition occurred in G(1) phase, and was due to upregulation of p27(Kip1), resulting in inhibition of cyclin E/cyclin dependent kinase-2 activity and hypophosphorylation of Rb. In addition, the amount and/or activities of a number of proapoptotic molecules were enhanced. The antitumor activity in vivo against xenografts was at least partly attributable to reduced vascularization, resulting from decreased vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor production by the tumor cells. Metastasis of xenografts was curtailed with mAB C225 treatment, accompanied by a decrease in tumor production of MMP-9. Further studies showed that mAbs 225 and C225 enhanced the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy against xenografts of a variety of human cancer cell lines. Well established xenografts resistant to either mAb or drug treatment alone were eradicated by the combination therapy. Drugs for which this has been demonstrated include doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan. Antibody treatment also potentiated the responsiveness of human tumor xenografts to radiation therapy. These findings led to clinical trials of human:murine chimeric mAb C225 in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Results from phase I and II trials involving more than 500 patients are quite promising, in particular in advanced head and neck cancer treated with C225 plus cisplatin or radiation, in advanced colon cancer treated with C225 plus CPT-11, and in advanced pancreatic cancer treated with C225 plus gemcitabine.

{"title": "Lack of cross-species transmission of porcine endogenous retrovirus infection to nonhuman primate recipients of porcine cells, tissues, or organs.", "abstract": "Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been widely used in different porcine xenograft procedures inevitably resulting in exposure to porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). Surveillance for PERV infection in these NHPs may provide information on the risks of cross-species transmission of PERV, particularly for recipients of vascularized organ xenografts for whom data from human clinical trials is unavailable.\nWe tested 21 Old World and 2 New World primates exposed to a variety of porcine xenografts for evidence of PERV infection. These NHPs included six baboon recipients of pig hearts, six bonnet macaque recipients of transgenic pig skin grafts, and nine rhesus macaque and two capuchin recipients of encapsulated pig islet cells. Serologic screening for PERV antibody was done by a validated Western blot assay, and molecular detection of PERV sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma was performed using sensitive polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays, respectively. Spleen and lymph node tissues available from six bonnet macaques and three rhesus macaques were also tested for PERV sequences.\nAll plasma samples were negative for PERV RNA suggesting the absence of viremia in these xenografted animals. Similarly, PERV sequences were not detectable in any PBMC and tissue samples, arguing for the lack of latent infection of these compartments. In addition, all plasma samples were negative for PERV antibodies.\nThese data suggest the absence of PERV infection in all 23 NHPs despite exposure to vascularized porcine organs or tissue xenografts and the use of immunosuppressive therapies in some animals. These findings suggest that PERV is not easily transmitted to these NHP species through these types of xenografts.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2001-05-15", "authors": ["W MSwitzer", "R EMichler", "VShanmugam", "AMatthews", "A IHussain", "AWright", "PSandstrom", "L EChapman", "CWeber", "SSafley", "R RDenny", "ANavarro", "VEvans", "A JNorin", "PKwiatkowski", "WHeneine"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200104150-00022"}
{"title": "Tolerance to musculoskeletal allografts with transient lymphocyte chimerism in miniature swine.", "abstract": "Although transplantation of musculoskeletal allografts in humans is technically feasible, the adverse effects of long-term immunosuppression subject the patient to high risks for correcting a non-life-threatening condition. Achieving immunologic tolerance to musculoskeletal allografts, without the need for chronic immunosuppression, could expand the clinical application of limb tissue allografting. Tolerance to musculoskeletal allografts has been accomplished previously in miniature swine in our laboratory. Although stable, mixed chimerism has been suggested as the mechanism underlying long-term tolerance in a rat limb model, the mechanism of this tolerance induction has not been established. This report explores the possible relationship between hematopoietic chimerism and tolerance to musculoskeletal allografts in swine.\nTwelve miniature swine underwent vascularized musculoskeletal allograft transplantation from histocompatibility complex (MHC) matched, minor antigen-mismatched donors. Eight animals received a 12-day coprse of cyclosporine, one of which was excluded due to subtherapeutic levels. Four recipients were not immunosuppressed. Serial biopsies to assess graft viability and flow cytometry to assess chimerism were performed. Donor and third-party skin grafts were placed on recipients with surviving allografts greater than 100 days to validate tolerance.\nBoth groups developed early peripheral chimerism, but this chimerism became undetectable by postoperative day 19 in the cyclosporine group and by day 13 in the control group. Animals receiving cyclosporine developed permanent tolerance to their allografts, whereas those not receiving cyclosporine rejected their allografts in 6-9 weeks. Animals demonstrating tolerance to their bone allografts also demonstrated prolonged donor skin graft survival.\nInduction of tolerance to musculoskeletal allografts can be achieved in the MHC matched swine. Although hematopoietic chimerism is present in the immediate postoperative period, persistent, long-term chimerism does not seem to be necessary for maintenance of such tolerance.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2001-05-15", "authors": ["J LBourget", "D WMathes", "G PNielsen", "M ARandolph", "Y NTanabe", "V RFerrara", "AWu", "SArn", "D HSachs", "W PLee"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200104150-00005"}
{"title": "Effects of retinoic and glycolic acids on neoangiogenesis and necrosis of axial dorsal skin flaps in rats.", "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) and glycolic acid (GA) are frequently used in the treatment of acne and skin aging, as well as improving skin healing after dermabrasion and in photoaged skin. Examples of histologic alterations caused by these substances are vascularization increase and interference with inflammatory as well as regenerative skin processes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible decrease of skin flap necrosis areas in rats, by applying both substances to the skin 14 and 30 days before surgery, and analyzing histopathologic skin alterations after treatment. Fifty Wistar rats were divided into five groups of 10 animals each. They received daily retinoic acid application for 14 and 30 days, daily glycolic acid application for 14 and 30 days, and vehicle application (control group) for 14 days. After treatment, each rat was submitted to random dorsal skin flap (10 x 3 cm) elevation; flaps were sutured back in place over isolating plastic strips. The rats were sacrificed after 7 days and flap necrosis areas were measured through transparency and then analyzed using computer scanning. Statistical analysis was carried out using monocaudal nonpaired t tests and histopathologic examination was performed in all cases. Compared with the control group, treatment with both acids did not decrease average flap necrosis areas. Though groups RA 30 days and GA 14 days presented larger necrosis area averages (p < 0.05), groups RA 14 days and GA 30 days showed no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) when compared to the control group. Both substances caused spongiosis, stratum corneum thickening, and vascularization increase, with GA inducing greater granulomatous reaction and RA more spongiosis and queratinization. Group RA 30 days showed the most significant dermo-epithelial (including vascular) regenerative and proliferative effects. Retinoic and glycolic acid treatment led to significant and well-known skin alterations, with group RA 30 days showing most notable dermo-epithelial proliferative effects.

{"title": "Altered expression of angiopoietins and Tie2 endothelium receptor in psoriasis.", "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease in which epidermal proliferation is closely associated with excessive microvascular expansion within the papillary dermis. Angiopoietins have recently been identified as the major ligands of the endothelial- specific receptor Tie2. Angiopoietin 1 induces Tie2 signaling as a receptor activator and maintains blood vessel formation, whereas angiopoietin 2 destabilizes vessels by blocking Tie2 signaling as an antagonist of angiopoietin 1 and acts with vascular endothelial growth factor to initiate angiogenesis. In this study we examined the potential role of angiopoietins and the Tie2 receptor in vascular changes of psoriasis. Angiopoietin 1, angiopoietin 2, and Tie2 were upregulated in involved psoriasis skin compared to uninvolved psoriasis skin, healthy skin, and chronic spongiotic dermatitis skin. Angiopoietin 1 was expressed by stromal cells in the highly vascularized papillary dermis of involved psoriasis skin. Angiopoietin 2 was expressed by endothelial cells in the vicinity of the proliferating epidermis that abundantly expressed vascular endothelial growth factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, which were overexpressed in involved psoriasis skin, enhanced angiopoietin 2 and Tie2 expression in dermal microvascular endothelial cell cultures. Thus, our findings suggest that upregulation of angiopoietin 1, angiopoietin 2, and Tie2 is closely associated with the development of microvascular proliferation in psoriasis, and that the angiopoietin-Tie2 system may act coordinately with vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor to promote neovascularization in psoriasis. Moreover, successful antipsoriatic treatment was accompanied by noticeable reduction of angiopoietin 2 expression, suggesting that alteration of angiopoietin 2 expression may be particularly important in controlling vascular proliferation in the treatment of psoriasis.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2001-05-12", "authors": ["KKuroda", "ASapadin", "TShoji", "RFleischmajer", "MLebwohl"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1523-1747.2001.01316.x"}

The effectiveness of the fibular graft seems to be dependent on precise placement in a biologically and anatomically relevant site within the femoral head. The current authors present the Ioannina technique for application of a new computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing process in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head using free vascularized fibular transplantation. The objective was to develop a computer-assisted design and manufacturing system for an accurate and easier approach to the necrotic area in the femoral head. The Ioannina technique uses serial computed tomography scans of the proximal femur to identify the configuration of the proximal femur, and the size, location, and configuration of the lesion using a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing process. Optimal graft placement is determined and a guide wire canal is drilled into an patient-specific aiming device. In this process, identification of the optimal graft location is related to achieving that location surgically. The more arbitrary placement of the graft during conventional fibular graft surgery leads to accurate graft placement in only 55% of the patients, whereas the use of the patient-specific Ioannina aiming device resulted in optimal graft placement in 89% of the patients.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2001-05-12", "authors": ["A EBeris", "P NSoucacos"], "doi": "10.1097/00003086-200105000-00008"}

Thirteen hips of Catterall Group III or IV with collapse (initial stage in nine hips, fragmentation in two hips, healing in two hips) were free from apparent subluxation; however, their epiphyses were not vascularized to the medial margin. Seven hips with apparent subluxation of Catterall Group III or IV (fragmentation stage in three hips, healing in four hips) had extensive vascularized medial viable segments consisting of newly formed small arteries. Penetration of revascularization from the artery of the ligamentum teres was inhibited by collapse initially at the medial margin of the epiphysis. Revascularization consisted of newly formed small arteries that penetrated the medial area of the epiphysis after subluxation. After completion of healing, blood supply from the artery of the ligamentum teres was not important for nourishment of the capital femoral epiphysis.

The microcrystals of HA were prepared by following standard laboratory procedure. Housing, surgical implantation and bleeding procedure of all rams used in this study was conducted according to the NIH guideline and approval of UCUCA. A total of 11 rams were castrated by elastrator rings within a week after birth. At 7 months of age the animals were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 rams (n = 4) were not treated and served as the control group. Rams in group 2 (n = 3) were implanted s.c. with two HA capsules (80 mg DHT/capsule). Each ram (n = 3) in group 3 was implanted with two empty HA capsules and served as a sham group. All animals were housed together throughout this study and water, high quality hay and grain were given ad libitum. The sterilized ceramics were inserted S/C through a single incision using standard aseptic surgical techniques. Gross, radiographic and histological examinations of the site of implantation did not show any untoward reactions during the entire investigation. Histopathological evaluation have revealed that all HA implants were encapsulated with hyaline fibrous tissue at the end of two weeks, and the degree of encapsulation increased with time. Results collected from this investigation showed that the passage of DHT through HA capsules started within 3 days after implantation. Furthermore, sustained delivery of DHT by means of HA devices at levels ranging between 1.4-3.3 ng/ml imposed continuous negative feedback on post-castration rise in serum LH and FSH secretion. Representative retrieved implants showed slight degradation of the implant (27% +/- 38) and increased erosion at the sharp edges with time was observed. Light and electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that at the end of four weeks postimplantation, a well developed granulation tissue is seen surrounding the implants. The thin developing fibrous capsule infiltrated with macrophages and numerous small and large capillaries were observed. A well-developed fibrous capsule formed at 6 months postimplantation. Four different layers were observed: (i) the HA tissue layer contains macrophages, some mononuclear leukocytes, and fibroblasts indicative of the chronic inflammatory responses, (ii) the fibrous capsule layer is composed of longitudinally oriented fibroblasts and mature collagen fibers, (iii) the vascularization layer contains numerous large and small capillaries, and (iii) the outer side of the fibrous capsule predominately composed of adipose tissue. Data obtained from this study suggest that lack of vascularization at the immediate HA tissue layer and the fibrous capsule layer may function to retard the rapid release of DHT from the HA implants. This retardation of DHT release from HA implants by the formation of fibrous capsule is needed to compensate for the macropores formed during the biodegradation of the implants.", "journal": "Biomedical sciences instrumentation", "date": "2001-05-12", "authors": ["HBenghuzzi", "BEngland"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Revascularization and microcirculation of freely grafted islets of Langerhans.", "abstract": "A considerable number of experimental studies have demonstrated that the reestablishment of an appropriate microvascular supply is an essential prerequisite for successful pancreatic islet transplantation. Freely transplanted islets show the first signs of angiogenesis (i.e., capillary sprout formation and protrusion) as early as 2 days after transplantation, and the entire vascularization process is completed after 10 to 14 days. Cryopreservation and culture of the isolated islets before transplantation and hyperglycemia of the transplant recipient seem not to affect the vascularization process essentially. In addition, immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporin A and 15-deoxyspergualin, do not or only slightly inhibit revascularization of syngeneic islets; however, they are not able to prevent completely xenograft-induced microvascular perfusion failure. In contrast, novel immunosuppressants (e.g., RS-61443) or dietary supplementation of the antioxidant vitamin E were shown to prevent microvascular graft rejection almost completely, including leukocyte recruitment and capillary perfusion failure. Thus the development of novel strategies to improve posttransplant islet function should include concepts that accelerate the vascularization process and protect the newly formed microvasculature from rejection-mediated injury.

Cardiomyocyte Grafting for Cardiac Repair: Graft Cell Death and Anti-Death Strategies. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (2001) 33, 907-921. Recent studies indicate that cardiomyocyte grafting forms new myocardium in injured hearts. It is unknown, however, whether physiologically significant amounts of new myocardium can be generated. Pilot experiments showed that death of grafted rat neonatal cardiomyocytes limited formation of new myocardium after acute cryoinjury. Time-course studies showed that, at 30 min after grafting, only 1.8(+/-0.4)% of graft cells were TUNEL-positive. At 1 day, however, TUNEL indices increased to 32.1(+/-3.5)% and remained high at 4 days, averaging 9.8(+/-3.8)%. By 7 days, TUNEL decreased to 1.0(+/-0.2)%. Electron microscopy revealed that dead cells had features of both irreversible ischemic injury and apoptosis. To test whether ischemia contributed to poor graft survival, grafts were placed into vascularized 2-week-old cardiac granulation tissue or normal myocardium. TUNEL indices were reduced by 53% and 86%, respectively. Adenoviral infection of graft cells with the cytoprotective kinase Akt, or constitutively active Akt, reduced TUNEL indices by 31% and 40%, respectively, compared to beta -gal-transfected controls. Neither treatment reached statistical significance compared to untreated controls, however. Heat shock reduced cardiomyocyte death in vitro in response to serum deprivation, glucose depletion, and viral activation of the Fas death pathway. When cardiomyocytes were heat shocked prior to grafting, graft cell death in vivo was reduced by 54% at day 1. Therefore, high levels of cardiomyocyte death occur for at least 4 days after grafting into injured hearts, in large part due to ischemia.

There were 28 balanic, 45 subcoronal, 10 distal penile, 12 mid penile and 7 penoscrotal hypospadias. Twenty-two cases had an associated ventral penile curvature. The Magpi technique was utilized for the balanic hypospadias, the Mathieu for the subcoronal and distal penile hypospadias without curvature, the Duckett technique was utilized for the middle penile third and some penoscrotal hypospadias, and the two-stage procedure with extragenital free skin graft in some of the cases with penoscrotal hypospadias.\nThe overall complication rate was 6.4%. Good results were achieved in all patients treated with the Magpi technique. Two patients treated with the Mathieu technique developed fistula that was corrected in a second procedure, and one patient developed a stricture at 6 years, which required another reconstruction procedure. Three patients treated with the Duckett technique developed fistula that required another repair procedure. There was one case of stricture along the entire length of the graft in the patients treated with the two-stage procedure and extragenital free skin graft, and satisfactory results were achieved in the remaining patients.\nAs in any other urethroplasty procedure, hypospadias repair requires a correct choice of technique for each particular case. Success depends on good tissue vascularization, which a surgeon with experience in these techniques can achieve better than one that is less experienced. It is therefore advisable not to overdiversify.", "journal": "Archivos espanoles de urologia", "date": "2001-05-09", "authors": ["F JGallo Rolan\u00eda"], "doi": null}

The myocutaneous flap vascularized by gluteal inferior artery was anastomosed on thoracodorsal pedicle or on humeral vein. Added procedures have been symmetrizations (21), flap modifications (21), nipple reconstruction (20). Thirty three flaps presented good survey. Cosmetic results were excellent in five cases, good in 21 cases, middle in eight cases. Flap disadvantages were: possible failure of microsurgery with vessel thrombosis and flap necrosis, long operative time (average five hours), variable quality of the skin flap and hypoesthesia of the posterior area of buttock. Flap advantages were: the suffisant volume (300 to 500 g), the simple procedure to raise the flap (after specific training) and discrete scar of the donor site.

We investigated the clinicopathologic correlates and prognostic relevance of MVD in a series of 122 consecutive patients with surgically treated laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma followed-up for a mean of 79 months. MVD was evaluated after CD34 immunostaining in 3 250x microscopic fields representative of the \"hot spot\" area, and expressed as the mean value of the vessel counts per millimeter squared. The overall median value of the intratumoral vessel count was 69.5/mm(2). In the 20 cases we analyzed, MVD increased significantly from normal to dysplastic mucosa and infiltrating carcinoma (p = 0.0001). Nineteen carcinomas (15.6%) had MVD values that were equal to or lower than the highest MVD value (52.7/mm(2)) observed in normal mucosa samples (in which the median MVD count was 34.5/mm(2), range 16.6-52.7/mm(2), mean 35.1 +/- 11.5/mm(2)) and were therefore considered poorly vascularized.

{"title": "Contrasting roles of p57(KIP2) and p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) in transplanted human and bovine adrenocortical cells.", "abstract": "Cell transplantation provides a way to compare the regulation of cell proliferation in the same cell type in cell culture and in a vascularized tissue structure in a host animal. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p57(KIP2), p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) and p27(KIP1) have been extensively studied in cell culture but their role in growth control in tissues is less well understood. In the present experiments we compared the behavior of cell cycle inhibitors in human and bovine adrenocortical cells in culture and following cell transplantation in scid mice. p57 was expressed in the majority of cells in the intact human adrenal cortex. However, double immunofluorescence showed that cells that are in the cell cycle are p57(-) adrenocortical cells, p57 and p27 levels were not affected by inhibition of growth at high cell density, whereas p21 was higher in dividing than growth-inhibited cells. However, p21 was also high in senescent adrenocortical cells. After transplantation of human adrenocortical cells in scid mice, p57 and p27 were observed in most cells in the transplant tissue. Over time the number of p21(+) cells decreased greatly in human adrenocortical cells, but not in bovine adrenocortical cells. This difference correlated with lower levels of cell division (assessed by Ki-67 or incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine) in the human cells in transplant tissues in comparison to bovine cells. The differences between human and bovine cells were observed both when cells were transplanted beneath the kidney capsule and when cells were injected subcutaneously in collagen gel. We conclude that the behavior of p57, but not p21, is consistent with a role as a physiological mediator of proliferative quiescence in the adrenal cortex. The high level of p21 in dividing adrenocortical cells in culture, and in bovine adrenocortical cells in transplant tissues, may be a response to conflicting positive and negative growth influences. Cells may enter the cell cycle under the influence of a strong positive mitogenic signal, but coexisting negative growth stimuli trigger a p21-dependent block to further progression through the cell cycle. This model suggests that bovine adrenocortical cells respond to positive growth stimuli in transplant tissues but human cells lack this response.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2001-05-08", "authors": ["MThomas", "N KPopnikolov", "CScott", "J RSmith", "P JHornsby"], "doi": "10.1006/excr.2001.5214"}
{"title": "Modeling advection and diffusion of oxygen in complex vascular networks.", "abstract": "A realistic geometric model for the three-dimensional capillary network geometry is used as a framework for studying the transport and consumption of oxygen in cardiac tissue. The nontree-like capillary network conforms to the available morphometric statistics and is supplied by a single arterial source and drains into a pair of venular sinks. We explore steady-state oxygen transport and consumption in the tissue using a mathematical model which accounts for advection in the vascular network, nonlinear binding of dissolved oxygen to hemoglobin and myoglobin, passive diffusion of freely dissolved and protein-bound oxygen, and Michaelis-Menten consumption in the parenchymal tissue. The advection velocity field is found by solving the hemodynamic problem for flow throughout the network. The resulting system is described by a set of coupled nonlinear elliptic equations, which are solved using a finite-difference numerical approximation. We find that coupled advection and diffusion in the three-dimensional system enhance the dispersion of oxygen in the tissue compared to the predictions of simplified axially distributed models, and that no \"lethal corner,\" or oxygen-deprived region occurs for physiologically reasonable values for flow and consumption. Concentrations of 0.5-1.0 mM myoglobin facilitate the transport of oxygen and thereby protect the tissue from hypoxia at levels near its P50, that is, when local oxygen consumption rates are close to those of delivery by flow and myoglobin-facilitated diffusion, a fairly narrow range.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2001-05-08", "authors": ["D ABeard", "J BBassingthwaighte"], "doi": "10.1114/1.1359450"}

After elevating a split thickness flap, the graft was harvested from the palate and placed over the denuded root surfaces. The flap was then coronally repositioned and sutured. Three dogs provided the specimens for 7- and 14-day time points and 3 dogs for 28- and 60-day time points. The animals were sacrificed and the blocks obtained were divided in half. One half was processed following the Spalteholtz method and the other was processed for routine histologic examination.\nAt 7 days, a clot was present at the demarcation zones and it was more organized at 14 days. At 28 days, the junctional epithelium was formed and the demarcation zones could not be delineated. At 60 days, the oral epithelium had regained its normal appearance. The attachment of the graft to the root surface was mediated by a combination of epithelial downgrowth and connective tissue attachment. Minimal new bone and cementum formation was observed. The vascularization of the graft at 7 days originated from the periodontal plexus and the overlying flap. At 14 days, the graft was completely vascularized. At 28 and 60 days, normal vascularization was present.\nThe vascularization of the connective tissue graft originates from the periodontal plexus, the supraperiosteal plexus, and the overlying flap.

{"title": "Peritoneal regeneration after implant of a composite prosthesis in the abdominal wall.", "abstract": "Prosthetic materials currently used to repair abdominal wall defects occasionally must be placed in direct contact with the visceral peritoneum. The prosthesis-peritoneum interface is the site of several possible problems, including the formation of adhesions and erosion of the intestinal loops, which may lead to the formation of fistulas. This investigation was designed to compare the behavior of two prosthetic biomaterials in composite form at the level of the peritoneum. Defects (7 x 5 cm) were created in the abdominal wall of 18 white New Zealand rabbits weighing approximately 2500 g. The defects (involving aponeurotic and muscular planes and the parietal peritoneum) were repaired with polypropylene (PL) + ePTFE (Preclude dura substitute) or Parietex composite (PC) prostheses. The prostheses were secured to the edges of the defect by continuous PL sutures interrupted at the corners of the implant. Three study groups were established according to the type of implant: group I (n = 6) (controls)--PL; group II (n = 6)--PL + ePTFE; and group III (n = 6)--PC. The animals were sacrificed 14 days after implant, and the prostheses were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The formation of adhesions at the prosthesis-visceral peritoneum interface were quantified according to a protocol previously described by us. The biomechanical resistance of the implant was evaluated using strips comprising prosthetic material and anchorage tissue. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare data corresponding to each group. There was no postimplant mortality. No infection or rejection of the prosthesis was observed in any of the animals. Firm adhesions were detected in the PL implants, whereas in the PL + ePTFE and PC implants the adhesions were loose. The mean prosthetic surface areas covered by adhesions were 7.67, 0.10 and 0.19 cm2 for groups I, II, and III, respectively, showing a significant difference between values corresponding to groups I and II and to groups I and III (p < 0.05). Comparison of values recorded for groups II and III yielded no significant difference (p > 0.05). In groups II and III, the neoperitoneum was homogeneous and composed of organized and vascularized connective tissue covered by a mesoendothelium that was interrupted by accumulations of fibroblasts and white blood cells. In contrast, a disorganized neoperitoneum of rough texture was observed in the group I specimens. At times, areas of hemorrhage and necrosis corresponding to the sites of adhesion formation could be observed. Resistance to traction of composite implants (mean +/- SD: 15.72 +/- 1.32 and 15.89 +/- 2.73) was similar to that of the PL implants (15.03 +/- 2.92) (Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0.05). It may be concluded that (1) composite prostheses show optimum behavior in terms of adhesion formation at the prosthesis-visceral peritoneum interface; (2) the neoperitoneum formed after the implant of a composite prosthesis almost physically and functionally replaces the normal peritoneum; (3) a significantly greater degree of peritoneal regeneration is achieved after implant of a PC prosthesis; and (4) there was no significant difference regarding biomechanical resistance between PL prostheses and PL + ePTFE and Parietex composites.", "journal": "World journal of surgery", "date": "2001-05-08", "authors": ["J MBell\u00f3n", "AGarc\u00eda-Carranza", "FJurado", "NGarc\u00eda-Honduvilla", "ACarrera-San Martin", "JBuj\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1007/s002680020069"}

The aim of this study was to compare MDR characteristics in vitro and in vivo by immunohistochemic and functional uptake assays in established tumor cell lines cultured and grown in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.\nThe presence of MDR was assessed in vitro in drug-resistant HT-29(mdr1) colon carcinoma cells and in nonresistant HT-29(par) cells by JSB-1 immunohistochemistry, uptake of the fluorescent dye Rhodamine 123, and quantitative measurement of 99mTc-MIBI accumulation. For in vivo imaging, SCID mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of these cell lines were injected with 99mTc-MIBI and 18F-FDG for scintigraphic and PET examination. After imaging, tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.\nAll HT-29(mdr1) cells cultured in vitro exhibited distinct JSB-1 immunoreactivity, although to a variable degree, whereas HT-29(par) cells were completely devoid of JSB-1 staining. Rhodamine 123 accumulated poorly in HT-29(mdr1) cells but strongly in HT-29(par) cells. Accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI was 0.05% +/- 0.01% of the activity of the external medium in HT-29(mdr1) cells, but about eight times higher in HT-29(par) cells (0.40% +/- 0.09%), a very low percentage compared with other tumor cell lines. No difference in 201TlCl accumulation was observed between both cell lines. In vivo, neither HT-29(par) nor HT-29(mdr1) tumors grown in SCID mice could be detected by 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy. In FDG PET, both HT-29(mdr1) and HT-29(par) tumors were clearly visible. FDG uptake was, however, markedly higher in HT-29(par) than in HT-29(mdr1) tumors. Both tumor types were poorly vascularized, as shown histologically. JSB-1 immunoreactivity was absent in all HT-29(par) tumors examined, whereas the majority of HT-29(par) tumor cells were stained. Electron microscopy showed that HT-29(par) tumors contained significantly less mitochondria than hepatocytes of the SCID mouse liver, which displayed high 99mTc-MIBI uptake in our scintigraphy studies.\nSufficient 99mTc-MIBI uptake is the major prerequisite for distinguishing successfully between drug-resistant and sensitive cells. Negative 99mTc-MIBI scintigrams are not necessarily associated with MDR expression. In some tumors, FDG may be an in vivo marker for MDR as suggested by PET.", "journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine", "date": "2001-05-05", "authors": ["D ELorke", "MKr\u00fcger", "RBuchert", "K HBohuslavizki", "MClausen", "USchumacher"], "doi": null}

Our present study was undertaken to examine the relationship between VEGF expression and IUGR in pregnancies with preserved umbilical artery end-diastolic flow.\nVEGF Expression was determined by immunohistochemical analysis of placentas from 17 pregnancies with normal infant birth weight and 17 pregnancies complicated by IUGR.\nWe found no significant differences in the expression of VEGF in villous syncytiotrophoblasts and intermediate trophoblasts in maternal decidua between IUGR and normal pregnancies. However, in both groups there was a strong correlation in the expression of VEGF with villous syncytiotrophoblasts and intermediate trophoblasts. In normal and IUGR pregnancies the infants' Apgar scores at birth were significantly correlated with VEGF staining in both syncytiotrophoblasts and intermediate trophoblasts (P < .05). A strong correlation also was found between cord hematocrit and VEGF staining in villous syncytiotrophoblasts (P < .05), but VEGF staining in intermediate trophoblasts was not correlated with cord hemoglobin or hematocrit.\nOur results suggest that VEGF acts in an autocrine and paracrine fashion in both normal and IUGR placentas, and its expression can have an effect on the well being of the infant at birth.", "journal": "Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation", "date": "2001-05-05", "authors": ["J YTse", "T TLao", "C CChan", "P MChiu", "A NCheung"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Study of the murine allantois by allantoic explants.", "abstract": "The murine allantois will become the umbilical artery and vein of the chorioallantoic placenta. In previous studies, growth and differentiation of the allantois had been elucidated in whole embryos. In this study, the extent to which explanted allantoises grow and differentiate outside of the conceptus was investigated. The explant model was then used to elucidate cell and growth factor requirements in allantoic development. Early headfold-stage murine allantoises were explanted directly onto tissue culture plastic or suspended in test tubes. Explanted allantoises vascularized with distal-to-proximal polarity, they exhibited many of the same signaling factors used by the vitelline and cardiovascular systems, and they contained at least three cell types whose identity, gene expression profiles, topographical associations, and behavior resembled those of intact allantoises. DiI labeling further revealed that isolated allantoises grew and vascularized in the absence of significant cell mingling, thereby supporting a model of mesodermal differentiation in the allantois that is position- and possibly age-dependent. Manipulation of allantoic explants by varying growth media demonstrated that the allantoic endothelial cell lineage, like that of other embryonic vasculatures, is responsive to VEGF(164). Although VEGF(164) was required for both survival and proliferation of allantoic angioblasts, it was not sufficient to induce appropriate epithelialization of these cells. Rather, other VEGF isoforms and/or the outer sheath of mesothelium, whose maintenance did not appear to be dependent upon endothelium, may also play important roles. On the basis of these findings, we propose murine allantoic explants as a new tool for shedding light not only on allantoic development, but for elucidating universal mechanisms of blood vessel formation, including vascular supporting cells, either in the intact organism or in existing in vitro systems.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2001-05-05", "authors": ["K MDowns", "RTemkin", "SGifford", "JMcHugh"], "doi": "10.1006/dbio.2001.0227"}

To evaluate ischemic injury of the bone, 28 amputated hind limbs of Fischer rats (ischemic insult group: four subgroups, each containing seven limbs) were preserved at normothermia for 1, 3, 6 and 9 hr and the tibiae were harvested. To investigate ischemia/reperfusion injury, another 42 amputated limbs were transplanted to recipient Fischer rats after ischemia at normothermia for 1, 3 and 6 hr, respectively. The tibiae from the transplanted limbs were harvested on day 3 and day 7 after the transplantation (ischemia/reperfusion group). Seven fresh tibiae were also harvested and used as controls (control group). The total RNA isolated from the tibia of each group was fractionated by electrophoresis and hybridized with 32P-labelled cDNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the radioactivity of intact and degraded GAPDH mRNA was measured. BVI was calculated as follows: BVI = [A/(A + B)] x 100, where A and B represent the radioactivities corresponding to the intact GAPDH and degraded GAPDH mRNA band, respectively. In the 1-hr and 3-hr ischemia groups, the BVIs of the ischemia/reperfused group were comparable to those of controls, although the indexes of the ischemic insult group were significantly lower than controls. However, in the 6-hr ischemia group, indexes of both the ischemic insult and ischemia/reperfusion groups were significantly lower than controls. These results demonstrated that bone damage was detected with ischemia at normothermia even after 1 hr; however, this tissue damage was overcome by reperfusion. There was no recovery from damage in bones that had been preserved for more than 6 hr, resulting in irreversible degeneration.

{"title": "Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on myocardial vascularization in the adolescent and adult spontaneously hypertensive rat.", "abstract": "To determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition treatment enhances myocardial vascularization in adolescent and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).\nMale SHRs were treated from 7 to 14 or from 16 to 24 weeks of age with the ACE inhibitor, perindopril, in either a low dose (0.1 mg/kg per day) or a high dose (1 mg/kg per day). Some rats were concomitantly treated with a bradykinin antagonist. At termination of treatment, the left ventricular wall was extensively sampled and the surface area density and length density of myocardial blood vessels stereologically determined.\nHigh-dose perindopril treatment prevented the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in adolescent SHRs and markedly reduced blood pressure and left ventricular size in adult SHRs. SHRs treated with the low dose of perindopril remained hypertensive, although there were significant reductions in blood pressure and left ventricular growth. High-dose perindopril treatment in adolescent SHRs led to a significant increase in the surface area density of blood vessels in the left ventricle after 4 weeks of treatment and an increase in both the surface area density and length density of blood vessels after 7 weeks of treatment Co-administration with the bradykinin antagonist did not reverse these effects. In contrast, ACE inhibitor treatment had no effect on myocardial vascularization in adult rats with established hypertension.\nACE inhibitor treatment enhances vascularization in the adolescent heart through reductions in myocardial mass, but not capillary growth. ACE inhibition in the adult heart with established hypertension reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, but does not enhance myocardial capillarization.", "journal": "Journal of hypertension", "date": "2001-05-02", "authors": ["M JBlack", "J FBertram", "C IJohnston"], "doi": "10.1097/00004872-200104000-00016"}
{"title": "The Ets-1 transcription factor is up-regulated together with MMP 1 and MMP 9 in the stroma of pre-invasive breast cancer.", "abstract": "The first steps of stroma generation are of pivotal importance for carcinogenesis because at this stage are initiated both angiogenesis, the prerequisite for continuous tumour growth, and the proliferation of stromal fibroblasts. These developments contribute to the onset of tumour invasion by secreting several matrix-degrading proteases. Both angiogenesis and the production of proteases are tightly controlled at several levels; of significant importance is transcription. The Ets-1 transcription factor transactivates several genes encoding matrix-degrading proteases and is thought to be involved in both tumour vascularization and invasion. This study therefore investigated, by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the expression of Ets-1 and of two of its target genes, encoding matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and MMP 9, in order to demonstrate a topographical in vivo correlation between the expression of these three genes during breast cancer formation. All three genes were first expressed within both endothelial cells and stromal fibroblasts during the onset of stroma generation around intraductal and intralobular in situ carcinomas and they were significantly up-regulated in the stroma of invasive ductal and lobular cancers. The results of this study further support the suggested in vivo role of Ets-1 for both angiogenesis and tumour invasion, via matrix-degrading proteases which are already expressed during the early stages of breast carcinogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2001-05-01", "authors": ["PBehrens", "MRothe", "AWellmann", "JKrischler", "NWernert"], "doi": "10.1002/path.844"}

However, sophisticated immune defense mechanisms, primarily evolved to combat infections, often work against medical transplantation. To investigate the roles of natural and adaptive immune responses in transplant rejection, we functionally inactivated key effector systems of the innate (NK cells) and the adaptive immune system (CD28-mediated costimulation of T cells) in mice. Neither of these interventions alone led to acceptance of allogeneic vascularized cardiac grafts. In contrast, inhibition of NK-receptor-bearing cells combined with CD28-costimulation blockade established long-term graft acceptance. These results indicate a concerted interplay between innate and adaptive immune surveillance for graft rejection. Thus we suggest that inactivation of NK-receptor-bearing cells could be a new strategy for successful survival of solid-organ transplants.", "journal": "Nature medicine", "date": "2001-05-01", "authors": ["SMaier", "CTertilt", "NChambron", "KGerauer", "NH\u00fcser", "C DHeidecke", "KPfeffer"], "doi": "10.1038/87880"}
{"title": "Transcriptional regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in epithelial and stromal cells during mouse mammary gland development.", "abstract": "Accompanying changes in the development and function of the mammary gland is the establishment of a vascular network of critical importance for lactogenesis and tumorigenesis. A potent angiogenic and permeability factor that regulates vascular development in association with epithelial-stromal interactions is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Analysis of VEGF transcription by RT-PCR revealed mRNA for all three VEGF isoforms (VEGF120, 164, 188) within the mammary gland of nulliparous females. During pregnancy the level of VEGF188 declined and became undetectable during lactation in association with the increased abundance of VEGF120 and VEGF164 mRNAS: All three isoforms were expressed at consistent levels within the cleared mammary fat pad throughout development. Furthermore, the presence of VEGF188 mRNA in omental adipose tissue at various stages established that VEGF188 is expressed specifically in adipose tissue within the mammary gland. Using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes it was demonstrated that VEGF188 mRNA transcription occurs as a late event during lipogenesis distinct from earlier induction of VEGF120 and VEGF164 mRNA during differentiation. In contrast, HC11 mammary epithelial cells only expressed mRNA for VEGF120 and VEGF164. Localization of VEGF mRNA and protein revealed that VEGF is expressed in stromal cells of the mammary gland in nulliparous females and then undergoes a transition to epithelial expression during lactation. By contrast, mRNA for the VEGF receptors, Flk-1 and Flt-1, localized to stromal cells within the mammary fat pad during virgin and gestational development and was expressed in the interstitial tissue basal to epithelial cells during lactation. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that VEGF is differentially transcribed by specific cell types within the mammary gland, and that under hormonal regulation it functions in an autocrine/paracrine manner.", "journal": "Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)", "date": "2001-05-01", "authors": ["R CHovey", "A SGoldhar", "JBaffi", "B KVonderhaar"], "doi": "10.1210/mend.15.5.0635"}

Implications for tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.", "abstract": "We evaluated the role of COX-2 pathway in 35 head and neck cancers (HNCs) by analyzing COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in relation to tumor angiogenesis and lymph node metastasis. COX-2 activity was also correlated to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein expression. COX-2 mRNA and protein expression was higher in tumor samples than in normal mucosa. PGE2 levels were higher in the tumor front zone in comparison with tumor core and normal mucosa (P<.0001). Specimens from patients with lymph node metastasis exhibited higher COX-2 protein expression (P=.0074), PGE2 levels (P=.0011) and microvessel density (P<.0001) than specimens from patients without metastasis. A significant correlation between COX-2 and tumor vascularization (r(s)=0.450, P=.007) as well as between COX-2 and microvessel density with VEGF expression in tumor tissues was found (r(s)=0.450, P=.007; r(s)=0.620, P=.0001, respectively). The induction of COX-2 mRNA and PGE2 synthesis by EGF and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in A-431 and SCC-9 cell lines, resulted in an increase in VEGF mRNA and protein production. Indomethacin and celecoxib reversed the EGF- and LPS-dependent COX-2, VEGF, and PGE2 increases.

Low and high IL-8-producing clones were isolated from the heterogeneous PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. The secretion of IL-8 protein correlated with transcriptional activity and levels of IL-8 mRNA. All PC-3 cells expressed both IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. The low and high IL-8-producing clones were injected into the prostate of nude mice. Titration studies indicated that PC-3 cells expressing high levels of IL-8 were highly tumorigenic, producing rapidly growing, highly vascularized prostate tumors with and a 100% incidence of lymph node metastasis. Low IL-8-expressing PC-3 cells were less tumorigenic, producing slower growing and less vascularized primary tumors and a significantly lower incidence of metastasis. In situ hybridization (ISH) analysis of the tumors for expression of genes that regulate angiogenesis and metastasis showed that the expression level of IL-8, matrix metalloproteinases, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and E-cadherin corresponded with microvascular density and biological behavior of the prostate cancers in nude mice.

Endothelial cells lining the blood vessels of these tumors have a high concentration of receptor-bound VEGF on their surface, providing a target for antibody- directed cancer therapy. To obtain a cloned antibody to this target when bound to its receptor on tumor endothelium, we used phage display technology to create a single-chain Fv (sFv) antibody library from mice immunized with the 165-amino acid isoform of human VEGF-A.

As a result, newly formed bone was observed in all experimental sites without the ligation, and the shape of the bone was exactly the same shape as the silicone mold. Newly formed bone was supplied by the superficial inferior epigastric artery, whereas newly formed bone was not observed in the control and the ligated flaps.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) are potent angiogenic molecules, making them ideal candidates for novel gene transfer protocols designed to promote new blood vessel growth. In this study, an ex vivo gene therapy approach utilizing cell encapsulation was employed to deliver VEGF and FGF-2 in a continuous and localized manner. C(2)C(12) myoblasts were genetically engineered to secrete VEGF(121), VEGF(165) and FGF-2. These cell lines were encapsulated in hollow microporous polymer membranes for transplantation in vivo. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a model of acute skin flap ischemia. Capsules were positioned under the distal, ischemic region of the flap. Control flaps showed 50% necrosis at 1 week. Capsules releasing either form of VEGF had no effect on flap survival, but induced a modest increase in distal vascular supply. Delivery of FGF-2 significantly improved flap survival, reducing necrosis to 34.2% (P < 0.001). Flap vascularization was significantly increased by FGF-2 (P < 0.01), with numerous vessels, many of which had a large lumen diameter, growing in the proximity of the implanted capsules. These results demonstrate that FGF-2, delivered from encapsulated cells, is more efficacious than either VEGF(121) or VEGF(165) in treating acute skin ischemia and improving skin flap survival.

The genomic structure and sequence of the smoothelin gene were determined by genomic PCR, RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. Comparison of the cDNA and genomic sequences shows that the small smoothelin isoform is generated by transcription initiation 10 kb downstream of the start site of the large isoform. In addition to the known smoothelin cDNA (c1 isoform) we identified two novel cDNA variants (c2 and c3 isoform) that are generated by alternative splicing within a region, which shows similarity to the spectrin family of F-actin cross-linking proteins. Visceral organs express the c1 form, while the c2 form prevails in well-vascularized tissue as analyzed by RT-PCR. We then generated specific antibodies against the major smoothelin isoforms and could show by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry that the large isoform is specifically expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, while the small isoform is abundant in visceral smooth muscle. These results strongly suggest that the smoothelin gene contains a vascular and a visceral smooth muscle promoter.

In the present study, therefore, a developmental approach was used in the baboon to determine the placental source of VEG/PF and its fms-like tyrosine kinase (flt-1) and kinase-insert domain containing (KDR/flk-1) receptors, and whether the rise in estrogen with advancing pregnancy was associated with a corresponding increase in placental VEG/PF expression and vascularization. VEG/PF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined by competitive RT-PCR in villous cell fractions isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation from placentas obtained on days 45 and 54 (very early), 60 (early), 100 (mid), and 165-170 (late) of baboon pregnancy (term = 184 days). Maternal peripheral serum estradiol increased from very low concentrations early in gestation (0.15-0.20 ng/ml) to an early surge of over 2.5 ng/ml on days 60-85, and peak levels of 4-6 ng/ml late in baboon pregnancy. VEG/PF mRNA was expressed in low level in the syncytiotrophoblast (<2,000 attomol/microgram total RNA), and values in this fraction did not change significantly with advancing gestation. VEG/PF mRNA expression was slightly greater in the inner villous core cell fraction; however, levels decreased (P < 0.05) between early and late gestation. Cytotrophoblasts were a major source of VEG/PF mRNA and levels increased (P < 0.01) from 3,631 +/- 844 attomol/microgram total RNA on day 45 to 25,807 +/- 5,873 attomol/microgram total RNA on day 170. VEG/PF protein expression determined by immunocytochemistry was abundant in cytotrophoblasts and lower in the syncytiotrophoblast and inner villous core cells. The flt-1 and KDR/flk-1 receptors were expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of the baboon villous placenta. The percentage of villous placenta occupied by blood vessels and the number of vessels/mm(2) villous tissue, determined by image analysis, progressively increased (P < 0.001; r = 0.97) from 3.4 +/- 0.2% and 447 +/- 29, respectively, on day 54 to 15.9 +/- 0.9% and 1,375 +/- 71, respectively, on day 170. In summary, the present study shows that villous cytotrophoblasts were a major source of VEG/PF mRNA and protein in the baboon villous placenta, and that cytotrophoblast VEG/PF mRNA levels and vascularization of the villous placenta closely paralleled the increase in estradiol concentrations of advancing pregnancy.

Ten free flaps were transferred to the head and neck region, seven to the lower extremity, four to the upper extremity, and one to the genital area. Ten fasciocutaneous flaps, seven muscle or myocutaneous flaps, and five vascularized bone grafts were transferred. All flaps survived, except for one in an electrical burn patient. The success rate was 95 percent. No vessel spasm was observed. Children tolerated long operation periods better than adults. The recovery time after surgery was considerably shorter than in adults. The mean operative time was 6 hr, and the average hospital stay was 12 days. The mean follow-up period was 27 months.

They attempted to discern any differences of results between FVFGs and CDs for post-traumatic tibial defects. The mean defect length of the FVFG and CD groups were 7.3 cm and 4.6 cm, respectively (p < 0.05). They selected as contributing factors: external fixation time, complication rate, hospital charge, union rate, and functional score (Puno's criteria), in order to compare the treatment of FVFG with that of CD. The external fixation times of the FVFG and CD groups were 176 days and 261 days, respectively. One septic non-union after refracture of the grafted fibula occurred in the FVFG group. Two non-unions (50 percent) at the docking site occurred in the CD group. The mean total costs of the FVFG and CD groups were 7,398,536 yen (US $68,505) and 11,798,153 yen(US $109,242), respectively. The union rates of both groups were 75 percent and 100 percent, respectively. The mean functional scores of both groups were 69.5 and 88.8 points, respectively. The functional results of the FVFG group were as follows: one patient showed good results; one, fair; and two, poor. The functional results of the CD group were as follows: two patients showed excellent results; one, good; and one, fair.

Excessive or insufficient production of IL-6 may contribute to certain diseases of the skin. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of IL-6 in the tumorigenesis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Initially, we transfected IL-6 expression vector, under the control of a CMV promoter, into human BCC cells and successfully obtained IL-6-overexpressing clones (BCC/IL-6-c1 and BCC/IL-6-c2) and a mixture (BCC/IL-6). DNA synthesis assay determined using (3)H-thymidine pulse incorporation revealed that IL-6-expressing BCC cells exhibited a much higher DNA synthesis rate than the neo control or parental BCC cells. We also detected a greater abundance of IL-6-expressing cell colonies formed in soft agar than in the vector control cells. Furthermore, BCC/IL-6 cells, but not vector control cells, were resistant to UV and photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced apoptosis, as confirmed using DNA fragmentation and morphologic change analyses. Immunoblot analysis showed that Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, was specifically up-regulated IL-6 transfectants but not in the control cells. Transient transfection of IL-6 transfectants with antisense mcl-1 greatly enhanced their apoptosis frequency by UV treatment. In tumorigenesis assay, IL-6 transfected clones formed tumors in nude mice more rapidly than the control cells. These tumors appeared to be highly vascularized using pathological examination. Supportive of this finding, we found that IL-6 transfected cells expressed elevated levels of two angiogenic factors, cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These results suggest that overexpression of IL-6 enhances the tumorigenic activity of BCC cells by both suppressing apoptosis and actively promoting angiogenesis.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2001-04-21", "authors": ["S HJee", "S CShen", "H CChiu", "W LTsai", "M LKuo"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1204076"}

{"title": "The Ets family contains transcriptional activators and repressors involved in angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The Ets family contains a growing number of transcriptional activators and inhibitors, which activity is regulated by phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. Among these factors, Ets1, Erg1 and Fli1 are expressed in endothelial cells during angiogenesis in normal and pathological development. The expression of these transcription factors is regulated by angiogenic factors in cultured endothelial cells, as well as by various stresses occurring during angiogenesis. Transfection experiments and transgenic mice analysis revealed that Ets family members are involved in the transcriptional regulation of endothelial specific genes such as those encoding Tie1 and -2, VEGFR1 and -2 and VE-Cadherin. In vitro studies plead for a role of Ets family members in endothelial cell adhesion, spreading and motility. Gene inactivation experiments show that Ets1 is dispensable for embryonic development. The phenotype of knocked-out embryos indicates that Tel is required for maintenance of the developing vascular network in the yolk sac. Altogether, we suggest that Ets family members act both positively and negatively during the different steps of the angiogenic process. The regulation of the initiation of gene transcription arises from the combined activity of different transcriptional regulators. Therefore very few transcription factors are specific for a physiological process, or a given cell type. The transcriptional network that regulates blood vessel formation involves transcription factors which are expressed in a variety of situations. The Lung Kruppel Like Factor (LKLF) which is required for blood vessel stabilisation during murine development is also expressed in the primitive vertebrae and in the lung of the adult (C.T. Kuo, M.L. Veselits, K.P. Barton, M.M. Lu, C. Clendenin, J.M. Leiden, The LKLF transcription factor is required for normal tunica media formation and blood vessel stabilisation during murine embryogenesis, Genes Dev. 11 (22) (1997) 2996-3006). Scl/Tal1 which is essential for angiogenic remodelling of the yolk sac capillary network (J.E. Visvader, Y. Fujiwara, S.H. Orkin, Unsuspected role for the T-cell leukemia protein SCL/tal-1 in vascular development, Genes Dev. 12 (4) (1998) 473-479), is involved in blood cell development and is also expressed in the developing brain. The EPAS transcription factor which was thought to be endothelial cell specific in the mouse embryo (H. Tian, S.L. McKnight, D.W. Russell, Endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), a transcription factor selectively expressed in endothelial cells, Genes Dev. 11 (1) (1997) 72-82) is also expressed in the liver, kidney and cells of the sympathetic nervous system of the chick embryo (J.

Ets1, which expression was originally detected in lymphoid cells of adult tissues, has been the first transcription factor to be identified in endothelial cells during angiogenesis in the embryo (B. Vandenbunder, L. Pardanaud, T. Jaffredo, M.A. Mirabel, D.

{"title": "Morphometric study of regeneration through vascularized nerve graft in a rabbit sciatic nerve model.", "abstract": "Adequate vascularization is essential for a successful nerve graft. Theoretically, immediate vascularization will minimize fibroblast infiltration and support axonal regeneration. In this study, histomorphologic and morphometric studies were carried out to determine whether vascularized grafts are beneficial, in terms of axonal regeneration. In a rabbit model, 4-cm segments of sciatic nerve were obtained and placed as a nonvascularized graft on one side, and as a pedicled vascularized graft fed by the inferior gluteal vessel on the contralateral side. Histomorphologically, the distribution of myelinated nerve fibers and Schwann cells was evaluated after toluidine blue staining, at 2-, 3-, and 4-month intervals. The following results were obtained. 1) Myelinated nerve fibers were more abundant in the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the vascularized nerve group at 2 and 3 months. 2) The average nerve-fiber diameter was greater in the vascularized nerve graft group at 2, 3, and 4 months (2 to 10 microm). 3) Schwann cells were more abundant in the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the vascularized nerve graft group at all time points. Based on the above findings, the immediate restoration of circulation in the vascularized nerve graft can be accountable for the increased number of surviving Schwann cells, the rapid clearing of axons, and myelin-sheath changes that occur during Wallerian degeneration, thus enabling \"morphologically\" optimal regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2001-04-20", "authors": ["K CTark", "T SRoh"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2001-12699"}

Neither cottonseed oil nor sodium chloride extracts of photooxidized heart-valve tissues caused any dermal inflammatory response. After implantation in the rat subcutaneous model for 90 days, the calcium content of 48-h-treated photooxidized cusp tissue [0.04 +/- 0.00 mg/g wet weight (gww)] was comparable to that of unimplanted control tissues (usually <1 mg/gww) and much lower than that of glutaraldehyde-treated controls (71 +/- 15 mg/gww). The porcine aortic wall calcium content (49 +/- 31 mg/gww) was comparable to that of glutaraldehyde-treated controls (59 +/- 8 mg/gww).

Management options include systemic antibiotics and observation, adequate pleural drainage, appropriate parenteral antibiotics, removal of necrotic tissue, and obliteration of residual pleural space. We prefer to treat the empyema with the procedure originally described by Clagett and Geraci in 1963. They demonstrated that postpneumonectomy empyema could be successfully treated by open pleural drainage, frequent wet-to-dry dressing changes, and when the thorax was clean, secondary chest wall closure with obliteration of the pleural cavity with an antibiotic solution. Failure was most often caused by a persistent or recurrent fistula. Because of this, when a BPF is present, the original Clagett technique was modified to include transposition of a well-vascularized muscle to cover the stump at the time of open drainage to prevent further ischemia and necrosis. Our preference is intrathoracic transposition of extrathoracic skeletal muscle. The goals of therapy for postpneumonectomy empyema remain a healthy patient with a a healed chest wall and no evidence of drainage or infection.

{"title": "Tumor vascularity: a histological measure of angiogenesis and hypoxia.", "abstract": "In this study we sought to clarify the relationship between tumor vascularity, hypoxia, and angiogenesis in human cervix tumors. Two hypotheses were established: first, that measurement of tumor vascularity can provide a histological assessment of both hypoxia and angiogenesis; and second, that expression of angiogenesis-related proteins will provide a surrogate measure of tumor hypoxia. To test the first hypothesis, we studied the prognostic significance of tumor vascularity measured as both intercapillary distance (ICD; thought to reflect tumor oxygenation) and microvessel density (MVD; the hotspot method that provides a histological assessment of tumor angiogenesis). The relationship was also examined of tumor hypoxia, measured using an Eppendorf needle electrode [percentage of values less than 5 mm Hg (HP5)], with ICD and MVD. To test the second hypothesis we examined the relationship between HP5 and the expression of angiogenesis-associated proteins [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF)]. All of the biological measurements were made on pretreatment tumors. Analysis of data was carried out using log-rank statistics, Cox multivariate analysis, and Spearman's rank correlation. Both ICD and MVD were significant independent prognostic factors for local control. Patients with poorly vascularized tumors (long ICD) had poor local control (P = 0.042). However, patients with poorly vascularized tumors, measured as low MVD, had good local control (P = 0.036). For 107 patients in whom both of the measurements were obtained on the same tumor sections, ICD and MVD provided independent prognostic information in multivariate analysis. There was a significant correlation between tumor hypoxia and ICD (P < 0.005) but not MVD (P = 0.41). There was no relationship between hypoxia and the expression of angiogenic factors (VEGF, PD-ECGF). These analyses show that measurement of tumor vascularity can provide different biological information that is dependent on the method used. It is, therefore, important that studies measuring vascularity should include an appropriate definition.

In 28 patients, the parenchymal lesion was vascularized by a systemic artery and was separated from the bronchial tree, thus matching the strict definition of PS.

{"title": "Donor-derived IP-10 initiates development of acute allograft rejection.", "abstract": "An allograft is often considered an immunologically inert playing field on which host leukocytes assemble and wreak havoc. However, we demonstrate that graft-specific physiologic responses to early injury initiate and promulgate destruction of vascularized grafts. Serial analysis of allografts showed that intragraft expression of the three chemokine ligands for the CXC chemo-kine receptor CXCR3 was induced in the order of interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible protein of 10 kD (IP-10, or CXCL10), IFN-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant (I-TAC; CXCL11), and then monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig, CXCL9). Initial IP-10 production was localized to endothelial cells, and only IP-10 was induced by isografting. Anti-IP-10 monoclonal antibodies prolonged allograft survival, but surprisingly, IP-10-deficient (IP-10(-/-)) mice acutely rejected allografts. However, though allografts from IP-10(+/+) mice were rejected by day 7, hearts from IP-10(-/-) mice survived long term. Compared with IP-10(+/+) donors, use of IP-10(-/-) donors reduced intragraft expression of cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, and associated leukocyte infiltration and graft injury. Hence, tissue-specific generation of a single chemokine in response to initial ischemia/reperfusion can initiate progressive graft infiltration and amplification of multiple effector pathways, and targeting of this proximal chemokine can prevent acute rejection. These data emphasize the pivotal role of donor-derived IP-10 in initiating alloresponses, with implications for tissue engineering to decrease immunogenicity, and demonstrate that chemokine redundancy may not be operative in vivo.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "date": "2001-04-17", "authors": ["W WHancock", "WGao", "VCsizmadia", "K LFaia", "NShemmeri", "A DLuster"], "doi": "10.1084/jem.193.8.975"}

{"title": "Use of folded vascularized rib graft in anterior fusion after treatment of thoracic and upper lumbar lesions. Technical note.", "abstract": "For lesions involving the anterior and/or middle column of the spine, an anterior approach is adequate for curetting the lesion and restoring spinal stability. Materials such as autogenous bone grafts, cages with bone chips, some artificial materials, or allografts are used as strut materials. Rib material is usually removed when the anterior approach is conducted for thoracic or thoracolumbar lesions. A rib itself is not rigid enough to support the load, and a bone union is not easily obtained. The purpose of this paper is to describe a method of grafting vascularized rib in folded form to fill the defects left after removal of a spinal lesion. The rib, with the artery and vein at two levels cranial to the involved vertebral body, was isolated from surrounding tissues such as the intercostal nerve, muscles, and pleura. After curetting the lesion, the rib was folded into three or four pieces to a length adequate to fill the defect and inserted as a pedicled vascularized graft. A total of 23 cases, including 14 men and nine women, underwent surgery in which this grafting technique was used.

Cyr61 is overexpressed, estrogen-inducible, and associated with more advanced disease.", "abstract": "To identify genes involved in breast cancer, polymerase chain reaction-selected cDNA subtraction was utilized to construct a breast cancer-subtracted library. Differential screening of the library isolated the growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene Cyr61, a secreted, cysteine-rich, heparin binding protein that promotes endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and neovascularization. Northern analysis revealed that Cyr61 was expressed highly in the invasive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, T47D, and MDA-MB-157; very low levels were found in the less tumorigenic MCF-7 and BT-20 breast cancer cells and barely detectable amounts were expressed in the normal breast cells, MCF-12A. Univariate analysis showed a significant or borderline significant association between Cyr61 expression and stage, tumor size, lymph node positivity, age, and estrogen receptor levels. Interestingly, expression of Cyr61 mRNA increased 8- to 12-fold in MCF-12A and 3- to 5-fold in MCF-7 cells after 24- and 48-h exposure to estrogen, respectively. Induction of Cyr61 mRNA was blocked by tamoxifen and ICI182,780, inhibitors of the estrogen receptor. Stable expression of Cyr61 cDNA under the regulation of a constitutive promoter in MCF-7 cells enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar and significantly increased tumorigenicity and vascularization of these tumors in nude mice. Moreover, overexpression of Cyr61 in MCF-12A normal breast cells induced their tumor formation and vascularization in nude mice.

{"title": "Inverse correlation of apoptotic and angiogenic markers in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is essential for tumour growth and metastasis. The induction of tumour vascularization is mediated by the release of angiogenic peptides. Among these factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are thought to be the most important. Previous experimental studies indicate that the process of apoptosis, the programme of cell death, may be related to angiogenesis in head and neck carcinogenesis. Therefore, cryostat sections of 49 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) were investigated immunohistochemically for pro-apoptotic factors caspase-3 and Fas ligand (FasL) using a standard streptavidin-biotin complex procedure. Expression of bFGF, VEGF and MMP-9 served as angiogenic markers. Additionally, intratumoral microvascular density (MVD) was counted by immunostaining of endothelial cells using anti-vWF antibody. Comparing the expression of apoptotic and angiogenic factors, a statistically significant inverse correlation of caspase-3 expression and VEGF and MMP-9 expression was found. Concerning FasL, the correlation of its expression with expression of VEGF, bFGF and MMP-9 was inversely correlated. With respect to vWF-immunostaining, statistical analysis gave a clear inverse correlation between the tumour vascularity and the expression of FasL (p = 0.0008) and caspase-3 (p = 0.0068). Our results suggest that HNSCC tumour angiogenesis contributes to a reduction of apoptosis in tumour cells.

Differential steps of tumor-induced angiogenesis were studied by a novel in vitro confrontation culture of avascular multicellular prostate tumor spheroids and embryoid bodies grown from pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. Vascularization in embryoid bodies started on day 5 of cell culture and was paralleled by down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In parallel, a dissipation of gradients in the pericellular oxygen pressure was observed as measured by O(2)-sensitive microelectrodes. After 24--48 h of confrontation culture, cells positive for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) became visible in the contact region between the embryoid body and the tumor spheroid and sprouted within the confrontation cultures during subsequent days. Tumor-induced angiogenesis resulted in growth stimulation of tumor spheroids, disappearance of central necrosis and a reduction of the pericellular oxygen pressure. Furthermore, tumor vascularization resulted in elevated levels of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), and P-glycoprotein.

{"title": "CD8+ T cell subsets TC1 and TC2 cause different histopathologic forms of murine cardiac allograft rejection.", "abstract": "CD4+ T cell effector function is sufficient to mediate allograft rejection, and it is suggested that CD8+ T cell-mediated effects are dependent on CD4+ T cell help. CD8+ T cells can be classified into at least two functional subsets: Tc1, producing high amounts of interferon (IFN)-gamma and Tc2, producing interleukin (IL)-4, -5, -10, and -13 and low levels of IFN-gamma. Because these subsets express different chemokine receptors, they may have different capabilities of migrating into grafts. Once in the graft, each subset may perform different effector functions dependent on the cytokines it produces. We asked whether allospecific CD8+ T cells, in the absence of CD4+ T cells, are capable of mediating rejection of a primarily vascularized allograft, and if Tcl and Tc2 cells differ in their ability to mediate rejection.\nHearts from H-2d mice were transplanted into H-2b RAG 1-/- recipients. Without manipulation, these fully mismatched allografts would survive indefinitely due to the absence of mature T and B cells. We adoptively transferred allo-(H-2d)-reactive Tcl or Tc2 cells from H-2b mice into each recipient. Grafts were harvested and analyzed on predefined timepoints, rejection was graded on a modified ISHLT scale.\nOn day 7, grafts from Tc1- or Tc2-injected animals showed grade 1-2 parenchymal rejection with stable phenotype and comparable distribution of graft infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Adoptive transfer of IFN-gammahigh Tc1, but not of IFN-gammalow Tc2 cells was followed by the development of graft vasculitis, as well as graft arteriopathy. Adoptive transfer of IL-4high IL-5high Tc2, but not of IL-4low IL-5low Tc1 cells lead to extensive infiltration of eosinophils and formation of giant cells.\nBoth Tc1 and Tc2 cells can mediate murine cardiac allograft rejection in the absence of CD4+ T cell help, although each subset elicits a different type of inflammatory response. In this model, cytokine secretion of either functional CD8+ T effector cell subset is an important effector mechanism in the process of allograft rejection: IFN-gammahigh Tc1 cells are important in early graft vasculitis, although IL-4high IL-5high Tc2 cells promote recruitment of secondary effectors like eosinophils.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2001-04-09", "authors": ["M WDelfs", "YFurukawa", "R NMitchell", "A HLichtman"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200103150-00005"}
{"title": "Heterogeneous vascular dependence of tumor cell populations.", "abstract": "Cells within a tumor are highly heterogeneous with respect to a wide range of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. The latter include such properties as growth, survival, invasion, and metastasis. We asked whether the degree to which individual tumor cells rely on a tumor's vasculature might also be heterogeneous. By adapting an intravital Hoechst 33342 staining technique, we labeled and isolated tumor cells based on their relative proximity to perfused vessels. Because tumor regions distal to the vasculature are likely hypoxic, we examined cells deficient for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcription factor that has been shown to mediate hypoxia-induced responses, including apoptosis. Despite reduced vascularization in HIF-1alpha-/- embryonic stem cell-derived tumors, their growth in vivo was found to be accelerated relative to HIF-1alpha+/+ tumor counterparts. We hypothesized that this paradoxical observation is because of decreased apoptotic rate, resulting in diminished vascular dependence of HIF-1alpha-/- cells. Analysis of heterogeneous tumors established from mixtures of HIF-1alpha+/+ with HIF-1alpha-/- cells revealed that the proportion of cells expressing wild-type HIF-1alpha was increased in perivascular areas and decreased in distal tumor regions. Thus, cells expressing HIF-1alpha were found to be highly dependent on proximity to blood vessels for their growth and survival in vivo, whereas cells that had lost HIF-1alpha expression were much less so. Heterogeneity in angiogenesis dependence was also observed among cell subpopulations isolated from human melanoma xenografts.

{"title": "Corneal blindness: a global perspective.", "abstract": "Diseases affecting the cornea are a major cause of blindness worldwide, second only to cataract in overall importance. The epidemiology of corneal blindness is complicated and encompasses a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory eye diseses that cause corneal scarring, which ultimately leads to functional blindness. In addition, the prevalence of corneal disease varies from country to country and even from one population to another. While cataract is responsible for nearly 20 million of the 45 million blind people in the world, the next major cause is trachoma which blinds 4.9 million individuals, mainly as a result of corneal scarring and vascularization. Ocular trauma and corneal ulceration are significant causes of corneal blindness that are often underreported but may be responsible for 1.5-2.0 million new cases of monocular blindness every year. Causes of childhood blindness (about 1.5 million worldwide with 5 million visually disabled) include xerophthalmia (350,000 cases annually), ophthalmia neonatorum, and less frequently seen ocular diseases such as herpes simplex virus infections and vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Even though the control of onchocerciasis and leprosy are public health success stories, these diseases are still significant causes of blindness--affecting a quarter of a million individuals each.

The present work reports a clinical case which came under observation because of cough, dysphonia and swelling of the left ventricular band with normal motility of the true vocal cords. CT of the neck, performed with contrast medium and axial scanning, showed a solid neoformation starting from the left laryngeal ventricle; densitometry proved moderately non homogeneous and showed radiological signs of hypervascularization.

In the years since computerized tomography came into clinical practice, diagnosis of this pathology has become easier and quicker Computerized tomography provides radiological indication of benignness which is certainly valid for laryngocele, a tumefaction containing air and which is therefore clearly differentiated from the radiodensity of the surrounding tissues. Vice versa, the homogeneous mucous content of the laryngeal mucocele can be altered by bacterial proliferation and may not show up on the CT as a uniformly hypodense area. Phlogosis due to the presence of colonies of bacteria can lead to greater blood flow in the ventricular site, thus making it impossible to distinguish the hyperdense boundary surrounding the hypodense mass. This, in turn, creates a blurry, ambiguous area of hyperdensity typical of increased vascularization. The rarity of the lesion, the relative likelihood of a simultaneous neoplasm and the ambiguousness of the clinical diagnostic elements available justify the use of preliminary bioptic microlaryngoscopy before surgically treating laryngeal mucocele.", "journal": "Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale", "date": "2001-04-01", "authors": ["CMiani", "PPasson", "A MBracale", "CZuiani", "CDel Frate"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Up-Regulation of Bcl-2 in microvascular endothelial cells enhances intratumoral angiogenesis and accelerates tumor growth.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be a potent mediator of angiogenesis that functions as a survival factor for endothelial cells by up-regulating Bcl-2 expression. We have recently reported that human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) seeded in biodegradable sponges and implanted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice organize into functional human microvessels that transport mouse blood cells. In this study, we implanted sponges seeded with OSCC-3 (oral squamous cell carcinoma) or SLK (Kaposi's sarcoma) together with endothelial cells into SCID mice to generate human tumors vascularized with human microvessels. This model system was used to examine the role of both endothelial cell Bcl-2 and the proangiogenic chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) on tumor growth and intratumoral microvascular density. Coimplantation of HDMECs overexpressing Bcl-2 (HDMEC-Bcl-2) and tumor cells resulted in a 3-fold enhancement of tumor growth when compared with the coimplantation of control HDMECs and tumor cells. This was associated with increased intratumoral microvascular density and enhanced endothelial cell survival. To determine whether the enhanced neovascularization mediated by Bcl-2 overexpression in endothelial cells was influenced by the synthesis of endogenous mediators of angiogenesis, we screened these cells for expression of VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and IL-8 by ELISA. HDMEC-Bcl-2 cells and VEGF-treated HDMECs exhibited a 15-fold and 4-fold increase, respectively, in the expression of the proangiogenic chemokine IL-8 in vitro, whereas the expression of VEGF and bFGF remained unchanged. Transfection of antisense Bcl-2 into HDMECs blocked VEGF-mediated induction of IL-8. Conditioned media from HDMEC-Bcl-2 induced proliferation and sprouting of endothelial cells in vitro and neovascularization in rat corneas. Anti-IL-8 antibody added to HDMEC-Bcl-2 conditioned media markedly reduced the potency of these responses. SCID mice bearing VEGF-producing tumor implants that were treated with anti-lL-8 antibody exhibited a 43% reduction in microvessel density and a 50% reduction in tumor weight compared with treatment with a nonspecific antibody. These results demonstrate that the up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression in endothelial cells that constitute tumor microvessels enhances intratumoral microvascular survival and density and accelerates tumor growth. Furthermore, endothelial cells that overexpress Bcl-2 have more angiogenic potential than control cells, and IL-8-neutralizing antibodies attenuate their angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2001-03-31", "authors": ["J EN\u00f6r", "JChristensen", "JLiu", "MPeters", "D JMooney", "R MStrieter", "P JPolverini"], "doi": null}

Osseous foci were a feature in the fibromatous and ossifying epulides. The mitotic rate was low and there was marked hyperplasia of the overlying gingiva with a prominent downgrowth of epithelial cords. These tumors recurred in 8 of 13 cats following surgical excision.

{"title": "Vascularization of the thumb. Anatomy and surgical applications.", "abstract": "Microsurgical procedures require rapid and atraumatic dissection of vessels. The authors have tried to schematize the most common variations of the palmar arteries, dividing the thumb into three segments, delimited from the MCP and interphalangeal flexion crease. If a vascular anastomosis has to be carried out in the first segment, the arteries that intersect the palmar surface of such a region do not generally hold much interest for the surgeon as far as size and constancy are concerned. One therefore can avoid frustration while searching in vain for such an artery by starting dissection in the dorsal compartment, where there is a much better chance of finding an artery suitable in every aspect. In replanting a thumb in the second segment, the ulnar collateral artery should be the artery that is looked for first, because it is usually the biggest, the most superficial, and nearly always is composed of a single trunk (Fig. [figure: see text] 18). Let us not forget, however, that the contralateral artery can frequently have all the necessary requirements for an adequate anastomosis. In the third segment, the layout of the vessels is rather difficult to schematize; if it is true that the inverted Y or H shape can make a microanastomosis easier in cases of distal reimplantation (Fig. 19), it is also true that such a pattern is impossible to foresee, and, therefore, the interest of such classification is more academic than practical. Skin loss coverage at the thumb level greatly differs from the that of fingers. In the past few years, a multitude of useful new flaps has been presented by different authors. Their accomplishment (especially those of the last generation, who base their survival on extremely fine vascular axes) presupposes an adequate knowledge of surgical and microsurgical anatomy. Surgeons dealing with this type of pathology should be capable of performing all of the possible flaps because each may be indicated in specific situations.", "journal": "Hand clinics", "date": "2001-03-31", "authors": ["FBrunelli", "AGilbert"], "doi": null}

Such molecules could serve as molecular addresses differentiating the tumor vasculature from those of the normal brain. We have applied Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) against transformed endothelial cells as a complex target to select single-stranded DNA-ligands (aptamers) that function as histological markers to detect microvessels of rat experimental glioma, a fatal brain tumor that is highly vascularized. Both the SELEX selection procedure as well as subsequent deconvolution-SELEX were analyzed by fluorescence based methods (flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy). Of 25 aptamers analyzed, one aptamer was selected that selectively bound microvessels of rat brain glioblastoma but not the vasculature of the normal rat brain including peritumoral areas. The molecular target protein of aptamer III.1 was isolated from endothelial cells by ligand-mediated magnetic DNA affinity purification. This protein was identified by mass spectrometry as rat homologue of mouse pigpen, a not widely known endothelial protein the expression of which parallels the transition from quiescent to angiogenic phenotypes in vitro. Because neoangiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a key feature of tumor development, the presented aptamer can be used as a probe to analyze pathological angiogenesis of glioblastoma. The presented data show that pigpen is highly expressed in tumor microvessels of experimental rat brain glioblastoma and may play an important role in warranting blood supply, thus growth of brain tumors.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2001-03-30", "authors": ["MBlank", "TWeinschenk", "MPriemer", "HSchluesener"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M100347200"}
{"title": "Interleukin-6 promotes post-traumatic healing in the central nervous system.", "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is an immune-privileged site where the role of immune cells and mediators in traumatic brain injury is poorly understood. Previously we have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-6, a cytokine that acts on a wide range of tissues influencing cell growth and differentiation, is an agonist for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in in vitro vascularization assays for brain microvessel endothelial cells. In this present work we focus on the role of IL-6 in promoting tissue repair in the CNS in vivo. An aseptic cerebral injury (ACI) was created in the right parietal cortex, using both wild type (C57Bl/6J) and IL-6-deficient (C57Bl/6J-IL-6-/-) mice to study the consequences of the absence of IL-6 on the pathology of brain injuries. We monitored the immediate, early, and late responses to this traumatic injury by characterizing several histologic features in the CNS at days 1, 4, 7 and 14 following injury. Acellular necrosis, cellular infiltration, and re-vascularization were characterized in the injured tissues, and each of these histologic features was individually graded and totaled to assign a healing index. IL-6-deficient mice were found to have a comparatively slower rate of recovery and healing. Furthermore, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran intravenous injection demonstrated leaky vessels in IL-6-deficient but not in wild type animals following ACI. Additionally, chronic expression of IL-6 in the CNS using transgenic GFAP-IL-6 mice resulted in more rapid healing following ACI. The accelerated tissue repair in GFAP-IL-6 transgenic animals is primarily due to extensive re-vascularization as detected by endothelial cell markers. Combined, this data suggests an important role of IL-6 in tissue repair processes following traumatic injury in the CNS.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2001-03-30", "authors": ["K RSwartz", "FLiu", "DSewell", "TSchochet", "ICampbell", "MSandor", "ZFabry"], "doi": "10.1016/s0006-8993(01)02013-3"}

Thirty surgical specimens (19 primary lesions and 11 recurrences) from 19 patients were examined. Median survival was 80 months. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using the monoclonal antibodies HMB-45, CD31. Mib-1, and p53.

{"title": "Post-radiotherapy contrast enhancement changes in fast dynamic MRI of cervical carcinoma.", "abstract": "This pilot study determines fast dynamic gadolinium enhanced MRI contrast enhancement parameters (onset of enhancement and time to peak enhancement) before and after radiotherapy in 10 cervical carcinoma patients. Before radiotherapy, onset of enhancement and time to peak enhancement were early, with a median of 4.5 and 5.2 seconds, respectively. High-grade tumors showed early enhancement, compared with low-grade. After radiotherapy, contrast enhancement patterns differed. In survivors, onset of enhancement after radiotherapy was later than before radiotherapy. In non-survivors, onset of enhancement after radiotherapy was still early. The median difference in onset of enhancement before and after radiotherapy in survivors and non-survivors was an increase of 3.2 and a decrease of 1.1 seconds, respectively. Early onset of enhancement after radiotherapy was a better predictor for survival than a high-signal intensity zone on post radiotherapy unenhanced T1/T2-weighted MRI. It is concluded that enhancement parameters from fast dynamic Gd-enhanced MR images can provide additional functional information with regard to tumor vascularization, and may have prognostic significance.

This study evaluates the alteration of the ciliary body vascularization by contact transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation in rabbit eyes.\nPigmented chinchilla bastard rabbits were used. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the parameters for diode laser cyclophotocoagulation of the pars plana or pars plicata. Then, treatment of the pars plicata (three rabbits) or pars plana (three rabbits) was performed in the right eye of six rabbits. After 2, 6 and 12 weeks histologic and transmission electron microscopic studies were performed. Furthermore, three rabbits received pars plicata cyclophotocoagulation of the right and pars plana cyclophotocoagulation of the left eye. After 2, 6 and 12 weeks, vascular casts of the ciliary body were investigated by scanning electron microscopy.\nHistologic and transmission electron microscopic studies showed a marked coagulation necrosis with subsequent ciliary body atrophy, destruction of the ciliary epithelium, pigment dispersion in the ciliary body stroma and peripheral anterior synechiae. Examination of vascular casts of the ciliary body revealed a marked rarefication of the capillary network within the treated areas of the ciliary body in all eyes and at every time of investigation. Anterior to the laser burns the capillary network was not markedly affected in the eyes with cyclophotocoagulation of the pars plana. After 3 months short vessel sprouts were seen, but regeneration was mostly incomplete.\nThe vascular casting technique is an excellent method for the investigation of changes in ciliary body vascularization after cyclodestruction. This study is the first to demonstrate a marked rarefication of the ciliary body vascularization after diode laser cyclophotocoagulation using vascular casts.

Consequently, urokinase-type PA (uPA)/plasmin antagonists are currently being developed for suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Paradoxically, however, high levels of PA inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) are predictive of a poor prognosis for survival of patients with cancer. We demonstrated previously that PAI-1 promoted tumor angiogenesis, but by an unresolved mechanism. We anticipated that PAI-1 facilitated endothelial cell migration via its known interaction with vitronectin (VN) and integrins. However, using adenoviral gene transfer of PAI-1 mutants, we observed that PAI-1 promoted tumor angiogenesis, not by interacting with VN, but rather by inhibiting proteolytic activity, suggesting that excessive plasmin proteolysis prevents assembly of tumor vessels. Single deficiency of uPA, tissue-type PA (tPA), uPA receptor, or VN, as well as combined deficiencies of uPA and tPA did not impair tumor angiogenesis, whereas lack of Plg reduced it. Overall, these data indicate that plasmin proteolysis, even though essential, must be tightly controlled during tumor angiogenesis, probably to allow vessel stabilization and maturation.

{"title": "Bone morphogenetic protein-7 modulates genes that maintain the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype in culture.", "abstract": "The vasculature is an important component in the musculoskeletal system, and vascularization is a key event in the development of normal cartilage and bone formation. Blood vessels deliver nutrients, oxygen, and precursor cells to maintain the structural and functional integrity of joints and soft and hard tissues. Therefore, agents that help to inhibit proliferation and retain the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are of critical importance. In this study, we examined the capacity of bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) to inhibit the proliferation of SMCs and maintain their phenotype.\nA thymidine-incorporation assay was used to monitor the proliferative activity of SMCs on stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), agents known to be stimulatory for these cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Northern blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to monitor the modulation of various genes and gene products. Immunolocalization of SMC specific markers was also performed.\nBMP-7 inhibited both serum-stimulated and growth factor-induced (PDGF-BB and TGF-beta1) SMC growth, as measured by 3H-thymidine uptake and cell number, in primary human aortic smooth muscle (HASM) cell cultures. The addition of BMP-7 stimulated the expression of developmentally regulated as well as SMC-specific markers, namely, Id-1 and Id-2, alpha-actin, and SMC-specific heavy-chain myosin, as examined by semiquantitative and quantitative RT-PCR and by Northern blot analysis. Additionally, BMP-7 exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by downregulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. The collagen type III/I ratio that becomes lower with the transdifferentiation of SMCs into myofibroblasts is maintained in BMP-7-treated cultures compared with untreated controls. Studies on the mechanism of action indicate that BMP-7 treatment induces cyclin-dependent kinase-2 inhibitor, p21, which was inhibited during PDGF-BB-induced proliferation of SMCs. Finally, BMP-7 upregulates the expression of the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, which are known to inhibit TGF-beta superfamily signaling.\nThese results suggest that BMP-7 maintains the expression of the vascular SMC phenotype. Thus, BMP-7 may prevent vascular proliferative disorders and potentially could act as a palliative agent following damage to the vasculature.\nIn musculoskeletal disorders in which the vasculature plays an important role, BMP-7 may be of benefit as an anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative agent for vascular endothelium and help maintain vascular integrity.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

{"title": "Expression of tyrosine kinase receptors Tie-1 and Tie-2 in giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath: a possible role in synovial proliferation.", "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that Tie-1 and Tie-2 are expressed in synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To elucidate the possible involvement of Tie receptors in synovial proliferation, we analyzed their expression by immunostaining in five cases of giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (GCTTS), which represents a proliferating lesion of synovial cells. Strong immunoreactivity for both Tie-1 and Tie-2, regardless of the individual patient's profile, was observed in all cases of GCTTS. Six sets of double immunohistochemical stainings for Tie-1/Tie-2 and fibronectin, CD68, or CD34 were carried out to determine the phenotype of Tie-1 and Tie-2-positive tumor components. In these studies, both Tie-1 and Tie-2 immunoreactivity were widely observed in the fibronectin-positive fibroblastic and the CD68-positive histiocytic mononuclear cells, as well as in the osteoclast-like giant cells. In tumor vasculature, Tie receptors were expressed in the CD34-positive endothelial cells possessing proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunoreactivity. We also evaluated the correlation of Tie-1/Tie-2 expression and proliferating cells in GCTTS by using double staining of Tie-1/Tie-2 together with PCNA. Overexpression of PCNA immunoreactivity was frequently found in Tie receptors-positive cells with no obvious differences in the expression pattern of Tie-1 and Tie-2. These findings suggest the possible involvement of Tie receptors in the pathogenesis of GCTTS other than solely via their involvement in angiogenesis and subsequent vascularization. It was demonstrated that Tie-2 immunoreactivity was restricted to the fibroblastic, but not histiocytic, phenotype in RA synovium, suggesting different regulatory control of Tie-2 expression in GCTTS and RA synovium. Overexpression of Tie receptors in GCTTS may imply a biological role for these receptors in synovial proliferation.", "journal": "Pathology, research and practice", "date": "2001-03-23", "authors": ["MNakashima", "TUchida", "TTsukazaki", "YHamanaka", "EFukuda", "MIto", "ISekine"], "doi": "10.1078/0344-0338-00017"}
{"title": "Lectin and proteoglycan histochemistry of Merkel cell carcinomas.", "abstract": "Changes in carbohydrate residue expression and in proteoglycan distribution occur during different stages of tumor development and progression. However, few data concerning carbohydrate residue analysis as performed by lectin histochemistry and proteoglycan distribution of Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare malignant tumor of the skin, have been reported. Hence, lectin- and proteoglycan immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin wax material of 9 cases of Merkel cell carcinomas characterized by cytokeratin and neurofilament immunohistochemistry. The lectin binding pattern of tumor cells varied between lectins with different sugar binding specificities, while within a given nominal sugar specificity intensities were remarkably similar between tumors from different patients. The most intensive reaction was observed using Con A (mannose/glucose-specific) followed by LCA with the same specificity and the N-Acetyl glucosamine-specific lectins (WGA, UDA, CMA), while no fucose binding sites were detected (UEA-I). In addition, N-Acetyl galactosamine residues were only occasionally detected. The lectin binding pattern of Merkel cell carcinoma cells indicated that predominantly N-linked glycans and not O-linked glycans, typical for mucins of most epithelia, were present. Hence these tumor cells were relatively undifferentiated and resembled stem cells more closely than differentiated epithelia. The tumor stroma was especially evaluated in this study and showed a lectin reaction, which was intermediate between the tumor cells and extra-tumoral stroma. For example, the reactions of N-Acetyl galactosamine-specific lectins were intensive in the extra-tumoral stroma but nearly negative in tumor cells, while the lectin reaction of the intra-tumoral stroma was similar to the cellular reaction. These results indicated an influence of tumor cells on the stromal constituents. Antibodies against chondroitin type glycosaminoglycans reacted with the tumor stroma and the pericellular substance around the tumor cells most intensely in - and around the major tumor septae which, in general, were well vascularized. The most intensive immunoreactivity was detected using the chondroitin-6-sulfate antibody. The cellular and membrane-associated reaction for heparan sulfate was less intensive in comparison to epidermal cells. In conclusion the pattern of lectin-binding sites, the high chondroitin(sulfate) specific reactivity and the relatively low intensity of heparan sulfate immunohistochemistry indicate a low degree of differentiation and high malignity of the tumors, which is consistent with the clinical behavior of Merkel cell carcinomas.", "journal": "Experimental dermatology", "date": "2001-03-22", "authors": ["KSames", "USchumacher", "ZHalata", "E JVan Damme", "W JPeumans", "BAsmus", "RMoll", "IMoll"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1600-0625.2001.010002100.x"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis in the placenta.", "abstract": "The mammalian placenta is the organ through which respiratory gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged between the maternal and fetal systems. Thus, transplacental exchange provides for all the metabolic demands of fetal growth and development. The rate of transplacental exchange depends primarily on the rates of uterine (maternal placental) and umbilical (fetal placental) blood flows. In fact, increased uterine vascular resistance and reduced uterine blood flow can be used as predictors of high risk pregnancies and are associated with fetal growth retardation. The rates of placental blood flow, in turn, are dependent on placental vascularization, and placental angiogenesis is therefore critical for the successful development of viable, healthy offspring. Recent studies, including gene knockouts in mice, indicate that the vascular endothelial growth factors represent a major class of placental angiogenic factors. Other angiogenic factors, such as the fibroblast growth factors or perhaps the angiopoietins, also may play important roles in placental vascularization. In addition, recent observations suggest that these angiogenic factors interact with the local vasodilator nitric oxide to coordinate placental angiogenesis and blood flow. In the future, regulators of angiogenesis that are currently being developed may provide novel and powerful methods to ensure positive outcomes for most pregnancies.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2001-03-22", "authors": ["L PReynolds", "D ARedmer"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod64.4.1033"}

In the present study, the biocompatibility of various EN-crosslinked collagen matrices was evaluated following subcutaneous implantation in rats for periods up to 10 weeks. The effects of the crosslink density, referred to as the number of free primary amino groups per 1,000 amino acid residues (EN10, EN14, EN18, or EN22), the amount of heparin immobilized to EN14, and the effect of preloading heparinized EN14 with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the induced tissue reaction were studied. EN-crosslinked collagen was biocompatible at both early and late time intervals, and matrices with high crosslink densities (i.e., EN14, EN10) especially demonstrated a significantly decreased antigenic response when compared to noncrosslinked collagen. Furthermore, increased crosslinking resulted in a decreased degradation rate. Immobilization of heparin onto EN14 resulted in a similar to EN14 (thus without heparin) or somewhat reduced tissue reaction, but fibrin formation and vascularization were increased with increasing quantities of immobilized heparin. Matrices preloaded with bFGF also demonstrated good biocompatibility, especially in combination with higher amounts of immobilized heparin. The latter matrices [EN14 with high heparin and bFGF, thus EN14-H (0.4)F and EN14-H(1.0)F] demonstrated significantly increased vascularization for periods up to 3 weeks. Neither heparin immobilization nor bFGF preloading induced an increased antigenic response. It is concluded that the results of this study justify further evaluation of bFGF preloaded, heparin immobilized EN14 collagen, as a matrix for endothelial cell seeding in experimental animals.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research", "date": "2001-03-20", "authors": ["P Bvan Wachem", "J APlantinga", "M JWissink", "RBeernink", "A APoot", "G HEngbers", "TBeugeling", "W Gvan Aken", "JFeijen", "M Jvan Luyn"], "doi": "10.1002/1097-4636(20010605)55:3<368::aid-jbm1025>3.0.co;2-5"}
{"title": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase mediates the change from retinal to vitreal neovascularization in ischemic retinopathy.", "abstract": "Intravitreal neovascular diseases are a major cause of blindness worldwide. It remains unclear why neovessels in many retinal diseases spread into the physiologically nonvascularized vitreous rather than into the ischemic retinal areas, where the angiogenic factors are released. Here we show that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in the ischemic retina. Using iNOS knockout mice and the iNOS inhibitor 1400W, we demonstrate that iNOS expression inhibits angiogenesis locally in the avascular retina, mediated at least in part by a downregulation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in cells adjacent to iNOS-expressing cells. At the same time, pathological intravitreal neovascularization is considerably stronger in iNOS-expressing animals. These findings demonstrate that iNOS plays a crucial role in retinal neovascular disease and show that it offers an ideal target for the control of vitreal neovascularization through improvement of the vascularization of the hypoxic retina.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2001-03-20", "authors": ["FSennlaub", "YCourtois", "OGoureau"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI10874"}

{"title": "Induction of bone formation by recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 and sintered porous hydroxyapatite in adult primates.", "abstract": "A critical issue in tissue engineering and morphogenesis of bone is the development of novel biomimetic biomaterials that are capable of optimizing the biological activity of recombinant human bone morphogenetic and osteogenic proteins, which are molecules that initiate bone formation in vivo. From a therapeutic perspective, a carrier matrix is required for the local delivery of these proteins to evoke a desired osteogenic effect. In view of the affinity of these proteins for hydroxyapatite, which may reflect the in vivo supramolecular assembly of bone proteins bound to both the extracellular matrix and the mineral component of bone, we investigated the efficacy of single applications of different doses of human osteogenic protein-1 (hOP-1) adsorbed onto sintered porous hydroxyapatites for bone induction in orthotopic calvarial defects in 12 adult male baboons (Papio ursinus) and heterotopically in the rectus abdominis of four additional baboons. In orthotopic specimens, pretreatment of sintered porous hydroxyapatites with 100 microgram of hOP-1 in 500 microliter of 5 mM hydrochloric acid resulted in rapid and diffuse osteoinduction restricted within the porous spaces of the hydroxyapatite, as evaluated by histology and histomorphometry on day 30. Hydroxyapatites treated with 500 microgram of hOP-1 showed a different pattern of bone formation and distribution on day 30 as compared with the lower dose of the recombinant morphogen. Although bone formation was extensive with the higher dose, it was found on the endocranial and pericranial aspects of the specimens, enveloping the implanted hydroxyapatite carrier, and the internal porous spaces were occupied by a rich vascular network without any bone formation. By 90 and 365 days after the implantation of both doses of hOP-1, however, there was remodelling and complete penetration of the newly induced bone within the available porous spaces. The combination of hOP-1 and hydroxyapatite also showed extensive bone formation in heterotopic specimens harvested from the rectus abdominis muscle of the baboon using doses of 5, 25, and 45 microgram of hOP-1 per implant. These findings in the adult primate demonstrate extensive bone formation by hOP-1 adsorbed onto sintered porous hydroxyapatites and suggest that predictable osteogenesis in clinical contexts for treatment of craniofacial bone defects may be engineered using inorganic, nonimmunogenic, and carvable delivery systems that initiate osteogenesis with relatively low doses of recombinant osteogenic proteins, thus mimicking the macrostructure and microstructure of living bone.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2001-03-17", "authors": ["URipamonti", "JCrooks", "D CRueger"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200104010-00012"}

{"title": "Gene array analysis of osteoblast differentiation.", "abstract": "We have used gene array technology to chart changes in gene expression during differentiation of the mouse calvarial-derived MC3T3-E1 cell line to an osteoblast-like phenotype. Expression was analyzed on a mouse gene array panel of 588 cDNAs representing tightly regulated genes with key roles in various biological processes. When compared with NIH3T3 fibroblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells showed generally higher expression of cyclins and Bcl-2 family members, as well as specific expression of products such as the CD44 antigen, which is consistent with their calvarial origin. MC3T3-E1 cells also showed a surprisingly high level of p53. Differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells involves withdrawal from the cell cycle by day 7, accompanied by matrix accumulation and, ultimately, mineralization. Gene expression patterns in induced MC3T3-E1 cells generally reflected these stages. Cyclins were sharply down-regulated, and expression of certain antiproliferative factors and tissue-restricted genes was induced. Many of the observed changes, such as the induction of follistatin, bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A, transforming growth factor beta, and matrix remodeling factors, reflect expected patterns and support the physiological relevance of the results. Other observed changes were not anticipated and offer new insight into the osteoblast differentiation process. An example is the sharp induction of the Tob antiproliferative factor, which has previously been associated specifically with terminal differentiation in muscles. Another example is the induction of the DNA damage-associated proteins EI24 and Gadd45, apparently as a normal aspect of osteoblast differentiation. The oxidative stress-induced protein A170 and the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates metabolic responses to oxidative stress, were also induced. This response may reflect the in vivo requirement for vascularization during bone growth and fracture repair.

The postero-basal and postero-mesial segments are irrigated almost exclusively by the right coronary artery. In the remaining segments the vascularization was of mixed type, although a considerable degree of exclusive arterial perfusion was observed in the antero-apical segment. The segmental analysis allows us to conclude that although arterial vascularization of the right ventricle depends fundamentally on the right coronary artery, the anterior interventricular artery irrigates more than 20% of the right ventricular myocardium.

{"title": "Vessel size imaging.", "abstract": "Vessel size imaging is a new method that is based on simultaneous measurement of the changes Delta R(2) and Delta R(2)(*) in relaxation rate constants induced by the injection of an intravascular superparamagnetic contrast agent. Using the static dephasing approximation for Delta R(2)(*) estimation and the slow-diffusion approximation for Delta R(2) estimation, it is shown that the ratio Delta R(2)/Delta R(2)(*) can be expressed as a function of the susceptibility difference between vessels and brain tissue, the brain water diffusion coefficient, and a weighted mean of vessel sizes. Comparison of the results with 1) the Monte Carlo simulations used to quantify the relationship between tissue parameters and susceptibility contrast, 2) the experimental MRI data in the normal rat brain, and 3) the histologic data establishes the validity of this approach.

The aim of this study was to determine whether VEGF inhibition could intervene in ongoing luteal angiogenesis using immunoneutralisation of VEGF starting in the mid-luteal phase. In addition, the effects on endothelial cell survival and the recruitment of periendothelial support cells were examined. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody to VEGF, or mouse gamma globulin for control animals, commenced on day 7 after ovulation and continued for 3 days. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), used to label proliferating cells to obtain a proliferation index, was administered one hour before collecting ovaries from control and treated animals. Ovarian sections were stained using antibodies to BrdU, the endothelial cell marker, CD31, the pericyte marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and 3' end DNA fragments as a marker for apoptosis. VEGF immunoneutralisation significantly suppressed endothelial cell proliferation and the area occupied by endothelial cells while increasing pericyte coverage and the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis. Luteal function was markedly compromised by anti-VEGF treatment as judged by a 50% reduction in plasma progesterone concentration. It is concluded that ongoing angiogenesis in the mid-luteal phase is primarily driven by VEGF, and that a proportion of endothelial cells of the mid-luteal phase vasculature are dependent on VEGF support.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2001-03-10", "authors": ["S EDickson", "RBicknell", "H MFraser"], "doi": "10.1677/joe.0.1680409"}

Endothelial cells have been shown to be the primary target of the recipient's immune responses that mediate both hyperacute and delayed xenograft rejection. Under conditions of oxidative stress induced by thiol deprivation, but not under normal conditions, pretreatment of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) with the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine, dramatically inhibited killing of PAEC target cells by IL-2-activated human NK cells. This same combined treatment reduced both surface expression and mRNA levels of E-selectin. Moreover, anti-E-selectin mAb, but not Ab to VCAM-1, protected PAEC from lysis by human IL-2-activated NK cells in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that expression of porcine E-selectin is important for the cytotoxicity of PAEC mediated by activated human NK cells and may be involved in the redox-mediated modulation of that cytotoxicity. It is known that NF-kappa B activation is required for transcription of E-selectin, and the current data show that the suppression of E-selectin expression by S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine pretreatment and thiol deprivation was associated with reduced NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity in PAEC. These data suggest that the regulation of porcine E-selectin may be important for modulating delayed xenograft rejection and that manipulation of cellular redox systems may provide a means to protect xenogeneic endothelial cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2001-03-10", "authors": ["STsuyuki", "J AHorvath-Arcidiacono", "E TBloom"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.166.6.4106"}

To investigate when and how such a simple cell aggregation forms the complex PP architecture, we analyzed the distribution of cells expressing IL-7R alpha (PP inducer cells), VCAM-1 (mesenchymal cells), CD11c (dendritic cells), and mature lymphocytes by whole-mount immunostaining of 17.5 days post coitus to 2 days postpartum mouse gut. Our results show that compartmentalization of PP anlagen commences at day 18.5 of gestation by clustering and subsequent follicle formation of IL-7R alpha(+), VCAM-1(+), and CD11c(+) cells. This process adds the primitive architecture of PP anlage with several follicles in which IL-7R alpha(+) cells localize in the center, while VCAM-1(+) and CD11c(+) cells localize at the fringe. This follicle formation is accompanied by the establishment of PP-specific vascular network expressing mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1. Mature B and T lymphocytes entering in the PP anlage are distributed promptly to their own target zones; B cells to the follicle and T cells to nonfollicular zones. Our analysis of scid/scid mouse indicate that the initial processes including formation of PP-specific vascular network occur in the absence of lymphocytes.

Eighty patients underwent repeated corneal transplantation, of which six underwent repeated corneal transplantation in both eyes, totaling 86 eyes. A total of 208 keratoplasties were performed in this group; 86 primary and 122 repeated keratoplasties. The most common primary indications for corneal transplantation were vascularized corneal scar in 31 of the 86 eyes (36%), followed by pseudophakic and aphakic bullous keratopathy (PBK, ABK). Of the repeated transplants, 55 eyes (64%) had one repeated graft, 27 eyes (31.4%) had two repeated grafts, three (3.5%) had three repeated grafts, and one (1.2%) had four repeated transplants.\nFinal visual outcome and clarity of corneal graft.\nAt the end of the follow-up period, 44 of the 86 eyes (51%) had clear grafts, but only 39.5% had good visual outcome.

An anatomical study and experience of five clinical cases].", "abstract": "The antecubital flap is a fasciocutaneous strip that has its blood supply provided by the first proximal collateral of the radial artery. This flap was described for the first time in 1983 by Lamberty and Cormack, but it has not been widely used and there have been only a few reports in the literature concerning this procedure. The aim of the present investigation was to demonstrate via an anatomical study and a report on five cases the viability of the various anatomical features of this cutaneous flap, and also its positive contribution to elbow reconstruction. The anatomical study involved eight fresh cadavers (eight upper limbs). An injection of colored prevulcanized latex was made in the humeral artery in the lower third of the arm. The aim was to determine which artery provided blood supply to the flap, its anatomical location, and also to look for possible distal anastomoses which would permit a distal pedicled flap to be removed. Contrary to the findings of other authors, in the present study it was found that the vessel providing blood to the antecubital flap always branched off from the radial artery. However, no anastomoses with distal vascularization were detected, which would have permitted a distal pedicled flap to be obtained. The use of the antecubital flap for elbow coverage was then illustrated by five clinical cases of soft tissue defects of the elbow. This method was found to be reliable, practical, and the flap could be rapidly dissected. Moreover, this particular technique is sensitive, and has an interesting rotational arc. The distal cutaneous island flap has the advantage of limiting scar tissue. A comparison between the antecubital flap and other pedicled flaps has then been made. In conclusion, it appears that this little-known procedure has definite advantages, and that it should be included in the range of surgical techniques that are available for soft tissue reconstruction in the case of elbow defects.", "journal": "Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique", "date": "2001-03-10", "authors": ["FDuteille", "LRocchi", "GDautel", "MMerle"], "doi": null}

Preliminary results in three cases of mandibular reconstruction].", "abstract": "The vascularized free fibular graft has been used in mandibular reconstructive surgery since 1975. This technique has been progressively developed, and it is now the procedure of choice for mandibular reconstruction although in certain postoperative circumstances it can be difficult if not impossible to monitor bone vitality. However, bone vascularization can be detected by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as this technique has been experimentally and clinically validated in the early diagnosis of osteonecrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MRI for the postoperative monitoring of vascularized free fibular grafts in human mandibular reconstruction. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was used to study the variation in contrast over time following injection of gadolinium contrast medium, and to evaluate the degree of bone marrow perfusion of the fibular graft. This variation in signal intensity was visualized in the form of a curve, i.e., a perfusion curve for the bone marrow region. An examination was performed in three patients at different postoperative times and under different conditions. In one case, MRI confirmed the presence of fibula blood supply in spite of the necrosis of the adjacent fascio-adipose layer. In this article, the methodological difficulties have been discussed, particularly as regards data processing, and the present results have been compared with the findings in the literature. Dynamic MRI is a simple, reliable, non-invasive technique and its use in the postoperative monitoring of bone marrow perfusion and vascularized free fibular grafts permits a determination of the status of the latter following surgery, i.e., whether there is an adequate blood supply or not.", "journal": "Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique", "date": "2001-03-10", "authors": ["EBey", "AParanque", "CPharaboz", "J LCariou"], "doi": null}

The orthotopic implantation model of human cancer has been well characterized, and fluorescence shadowing replaces the laborious histological techniques for determining blood vessel density.

A quantitative time course of angiogenesis was determined for an orthotopically growing human prostate tumor periodically imaged intravitally in a single nude mouse over a 19-day period. Whole-body optical imaging of tumor angiogenesis was demonstrated by injecting fluorescent Lewis lung carcinoma cells into the s.c. site of the footpad of nude mice. The footpad is relatively transparent, with comparatively few resident blood vessels, allowing quantitative imaging of tumor angiogenesis in the intact animal. Capillary density increased linearly over a 10-day period as determined by whole-body imaging. Similarly, the green fluorescent protein-expressing human breast tumor MDA-MB-435 was orthotopically transplanted to the mouse fat pad, where whole-body optical imaging showed that blood vessel density increased linearly over a 20-week period.

{"title": "Extraordinary case of matrotrophy in the African skink Eumecia anchietae.", "abstract": "The viviparous African skink, Eumecia anchietae, exhibits a matrotrophic fetal nutritional pattern. Until well after the limb bud stage, extravitelline nutritional provision is in the form of holocrine secretion originating from the stratified uterine epithelium of the uterine incubation chambers. Uterine secretions are absorbed by a specialized yolk sac ectoderm and chorioallantois through histotrophy. The yolk sac is not in close contact with the uterine lining from the limb bud stage onwards. The yolk sac ectoderm forms invaginations filled with uterine secretion and consists of a single layer of vacuolated hypertrophied cells bearing microvilli. The chorioallantois at the limb bud stage is extensive, well-vascularized, and not intimately associated with the uterine epithelium. Where the uterus is folded, the chorioallantois may interdigitate loosely. Chorionic cells are low to high columnar, clearly vacuolated, and bear microvilli. The allantoic layer consists primarily of squamous cells exhibiting villous projections. By the time embryos have well-defined digits, the specialized yolk sac ectoderm has regressed and the yolk sac lumen has been invaded by vitelline cells. The chorioallantois is very extensive and in areas greatly folded. Where it contacts the uterine epithelium, a proper chorioallantoic placenta is formed.

{"title": "A permissive role for tumor necrosis factor in vascular endothelial growth factor-induced vascular permeability.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces both angiogenesis and an increase in vascular permeability, 2 processes that are considered to be important for both tumor growth and the delivery of drugs to the site of tumors. This study demonstrates that transmembrane expression of tumor necrosis factor (tmTNF) is up-regulated in the endothelium of a murine methylcholanthrene (meth A)-induced sarcoma in comparison to the adjacent normal dermal vasculature and is also present on cultivated human endothelial cells. It is further shown that tmTNF is required for VEGF-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro and in vivo. This permissive activity of TNF appears to be selective, because anti-TNF antibodies ablated the VEGF-induced permeability but not proliferation of cultivated human endothelial cells. Furthermore, tnf gene-deficient mice show no obvious defects in vascularization and develop normally but failed to respond to administration of VEGF with an increase in vascular permeability. Subsequent studies indicated that the tmTNF and VEGF signaling pathways converge at the level of a secondary messenger, the \"stress-activated protein kinase-2\" (SAPK-2)/p38: (1) up-regulated endothelial expression of tmTNF resulted in the continuous activation of SAPK-2/p38 in vitro, and (2) an inhibitor of SAPK-2/p38 activation abolished the vascular permeability activity of VEGF in vivo. In conclusion, the study's finding that continuous autocrine signaling by tmTNF sensitizes endothelial cells to respond to VEGF by increasing their vascular permeability provides new therapeutic concepts for manipulating vascular hyperpermeability.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2001-02-27", "authors": ["MClauss", "CSunderk\u00f6tter", "BSveinbj\u00f6rnsson", "SHippenstiel", "AWilluweit", "MMarino", "EHaas", "RSeljelid", "PScheurich", "NSuttorp", "MGrell", "WRisau"], "doi": "10.1182/blood.v97.5.1321"}
{"title": "The use of muscle flaps to treat left ventricular assist device infections.", "abstract": "Left ventricular assist devices have become an important adjunct in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with end-stage heart failure. Although they may provide a bridge to transplantation, they are prone to certain problems, expecially infection. Because these are life-sustaining devices, changing the device or simple explantation may be a risky, if not impossible, option. Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness of a surgical alternative, namely, coverage of infected devices with muscle or myocutaneous flaps. Eighty-two consecutive patients who underwent the insertion of 88 left ventricular assist devices at our institution over a 6.5-year period were evaluated. Follow-up was provided for all patients and ranged from 1 to 7.5 years. The duration of ventricular support ranged from 0 to 434 days. All patients who demonstrated clinical evidence of infection were identified. Overall, 54 patients (66 percent) had infections locally at the device site, at distant sites, or systemically during support. Cultured organisms included gram-positive and -negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Of the 56 infections in these 54 patients, 21 (38 percent) were device-related, i.e., in the pocket created by the device, in the device itself, or from the driveline. Thus, 24 percent (21 of 88) of all ventricular support devices inserted demonstrated device infection during use. Therapeutic modalities used to combat device-related infection included both nonsurgical management with antibiotics alone and surgical procedures such as device change or relocation, device explant, and flap coverage. Eight of the 20 patients in whom the 21 device-related infections occurred underwent surgical intervention. Four of these eight patients undenwent local flap coverage of their infected left ventricular assist devices. All four patients also had evidence of systemic infection, or \"device endocarditis.\" Coverage was successfully achieved in all cases with pedicled rectus abdominis flaps. There were no perioperative complications. Two patients later underwent successful transplantation; the other two died from causes unrelated to the flap. In conclusion, the treatment of infected left ventricular assist devices currently includes both nonsurgical and surgical alternatives. Of the latter, muscle flaps should be considered a first-line intervention to assist in eradicating infection by providing well-vascularized tissue. Although there were no perioperative complications, the 50 percent mortality rate is consistent with that reported for patients with \"device endocarditis.\" It may be that flap coverage of infected ventricular assist devices, if instituted at an earlier stage in the therapeutic process, could help prevent systemic infection in these patients and, therefore, improve their overall outcome.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["O ZHutchinson", "M COz", "J AAscherman"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200102000-00011"}

In the present study, we confirmed the placental expression of DA D2 Rc transcripts by Northern blot analysis. Using in situ hybridization, we also first revealed that DA D2 Rc mRNA was expressed in cytotrophoblasts, syncytial trophoblasts, vascular endothelial cells, Hafbauer cells, and fibroblasts in the chorionic villi of the human placenta. The expression sites of DA D2 Rc mRNA led us to suspect other functions of DA in the placenta besides the regulation of human placental lactogen. Since the cells expressing DA D2 Rc mRNA are related to proliferation and remodeling of placental tissue, we tried to evaluate a possible involvement of DA in the regulation of placental angiogenesis. To this end, we used the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. In CAM assay, apomorphine, a potent nonselective agonist of DA, has an anti-angiogenic effect.

All seven patients were faced with a clinical situation that required surgical removal of a long portion of their affected distal femur. Three of the adult patients initially were treated for osteosarcoma with long distal femoral resections and allograft arthrodesis of the knee. The allografts ultimately failed, two because of aseptic failure and one because of infection. One patient required distal femoral removal for chronic osteomyelitis and pathologic fracture. Of the three children who were treated, two had turn-ups after long resection of the distal femur for bone malignancy, and one had a secondary turn-up after failure of a long distal femoral endoprosthesis. The technique uses the normal ipsilateral tibia as a vascularized pedicle graft to restore femoral length. The ultimate result, even after very high above knee resection, is a long above knee amputation stump. The followup of the patients in the current study ranged from 2 to 8 years.

To investigate the impact of the modulation of FGF2 expression on the neovascularization at different stages of tumor growth, we generated stable transfectants (Tet-FGF2) from the human endometrial adenocarcinoma HEC-1-B cell line in which FGF2 expression is under the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter (Tet-off system). After transfection, independent clones were obtained in which FGF2 mRNA and protein were up-regulated compared with parental cells. Also, the conditioned medium of Tet-FGF2 transfectants caused proliferation, urokinase-type plasminogen activator up-regulation, migration, and sprouting of cultured endothelial cells. A 3-day treatment of Tet-FGF2 cell cultures with tetracycline abolished FGF2 overexpression and the biological activity of the conditioned medium without affecting their proliferative capacity. Tet-FGF2 cells formed tumors when nude mice received s.c. injections. The administration of 2.0 mg/ml tetracycline in the drinking water before cell transplantation, continued throughout the whole experiment, inhibited FGF2 expression in Tet-FGF2 tumor lesions. This was paralleled by a significant decrease in the rate of tumor growth and vascularization to values similar to those observed in lesions generated by parental HEC-1-B cells. Tetracycline administration 20 days after tumor cell implant, although equally effective in reducing FGF2 expression and inhibiting tumor vascularity, only minimally impaired the growth of established Tet-FGF2 tumors. The results indicate that FGF2 expression deeply affects the initial tumor growth and neovascularization of HEC-1-B human endometrial adenocarcinoma in nude mice. On the contrary, the growth of established tumors appears to be independent of the inhibition of FGF2 expression and decreased vascular density.

Our study aimed to quantify the cyclic changes of perifollicular vascularization and to characterize the biological role of VEGF for hair growth, angiogenesis, and follicle cycling. We found a significant increase in perifollicular vascularization during the growth phase (anagen) of the hair cycle, followed by regression of angiogenic blood vessels during the involution (catagen) and the resting (telogen) phase. Perifollicular angiogenesis was temporally and spatially correlated with upregulation of VEGF mRNA expression by follicular keratinocytes of the outer root sheath, but not by dermal papilla cells. Transgenic overexpression of VEGF in outer root sheath keratinocytes of hair follicles strongly induced perifollicular vascularization, resulting in accelerated hair regrowth after depilation and in increased size of hair follicles and hair shafts. Conversely, systemic treatment with a neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody led to hair growth retardation and reduced hair follicle size. No effects of VEGF treatment or VEGF blockade were observed in mouse vibrissa organ cultures, which lack a functional vascular system.

Osteopontin is expressed in osteoclasts and is also present in bone matrix; however, its biological function has not been fully understood. To elucidate the role of osteopontin in the process of osteoclastic bone resorption, we conducted ectopic bone implantation experiments using wild-type and osteopontin knockout mouse. In the wild-type group, bone discs from calvariae implanted ectopically in muscle were resorbed, and their mass was reduced by 25% within 4 weeks. In contrast, the mass of the bone discs from calvariae of osteopontin knockout mice was reduced by only 5% when implanted in osteopontin knockout mice. Histological analyses indicated that the number of osteoclasts associated with the implanted bones was reduced in the osteopontin knockout mice. As osteopontin deficiency does not suppress osteoclastogenesis per se, we further examined vascularization immunohistologically and found that the number of vessels containing CD31-positive endothelial cells around the bone discs implanted in muscle was reduced in the osteopontin knockout mice. Furthermore, sc implantation assays indicated that the length and branching points of the newly formed vasculatures associated with the bone discs were also reduced in the absence of osteopontin. In this assay, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive area of the bone discs was also reduced in the osteopontin knockout mice, indicating further the link between the osteopontin-dependent vascularization and osteoclast accumulation. The bone resorption defect could be rescued by topical administration of recombinant osteopontin to the bones implanted in muscle. These observations indicate that osteopontin is required for efficient vascularization by the hemangiogenic endothelial cells and subsequent osteoclastic resorption of bones.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2001-02-22", "authors": ["YAsou", "S RRittling", "HYoshitake", "KTsuji", "KShinomiya", "ANifuji", "D TDenhardt", "MNoda"], "doi": "10.1210/endo.142.3.8006"}
{"title": "Constitutive expression of interleukin-8 by Mutatect cells markedly affects their tumor biology.", "abstract": "Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemokine for neutrophils and an angiogenic factor. Human tumors that express IL-8 may exhibit intense neutrophil infiltration and increased vascularization. Mutatect cells are a murine fibrosarcoma that can be grown as subcutaneous tumors in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Since neutrophils are a source of cytotoxic and genotoxic species, we constructed Mutatect cell lines that constitutively express human IL-8 to explore the involvement of neutrophils in tumor biology and genetic instability. An IL-8/neo expression plasmid was stably transfected into Mutatect MC17-51 cells and clone MIL-4 was isolated. Tumors initiated with 5x10(5) MIL-4 cells grew very slowly compared with tumors from pure MC17-51 cells or from 0.5 to 4x10(5) MIL-4 cells mixed with 5x10(5) MC17-51 cells. Over 95% of cells recovered from slow-growing pure MIL-4 tumors lost the transgene as measured by loss of (i) resistance to G418, (ii) expression of IL-8 protein and (iii) IL-8-specific DNA sequences. When tumors from mixed cell types were examined, loss of the transgene did not occur; rather, IL-8 producing cells appeared to have some growth advantage. The neutrophil content of tumors (as measured by myeloperoxidase) was directly proportional to the level of IL-8 expressed at the time tumors were excised. As reported earlier, the frequency of mutations at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase locus was also directly proportional to neutrophil content. To explain some of these biological findings, we postulate that early in development of pure MIL-4 tumors, genotoxic/cytotoxic neutrophils are attracted by IL-8, which in turn leads to loss of the transgene and to localized cytotoxicity of IL-8 producing cells. In mixed tumors, where the initial IL-8 concentration may be lower, tumors might become established more readily because fewer neutrophils may be attracted. This relatively simple experimental paradigm has revealed some of the complex biological changes that can occur as a result of IL-8 in tumors.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2001-02-22", "authors": ["A SHaqqani", "J KSandhu", "H CBirnboim"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/22.2.243"}

The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), averaged over all 26 subjects with an average gestational age of 29 +/- 6 weeks (mean +/- sd), was found to be 2.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(-9) m(2)/sec (mean +/- sd), but a trend was found indicating that ADC increased with gestational age at the rate of 0.07 x 10(-9) m(2)/sec per week (P = 4 x 10(-5)). To determine the usefulness of this data in predicting lung maturity, a simple three-compartment model was proposed which was comprised of intra-lung amniotic fluid, intra-tissue water, and vascular blood. The relative proportions of each compartment were taken from the literature, and exchange between the compartments was assumed to be minimal.

The transfer of the vascularized epiphyseal plate, although controversial, is advantageous in cases where future growth is needed (i.e., congenital anomalies and tumor resections in children). The use of the free fibular head flap, based on epiphyseal blood supply augmentation, was reported using the anterior tibial artery, or part of it, as the nutritional vessel. By using both the peroneal artery and the specific branch to the fibular head as a bipedicled free flap, we ensured both long-bone fibula reconstruction and augmented blood supply to the head. We report a case of subtotal resection of the humerus due to osteosarcoma in a child that was reconstructed by this method. A preoperative study was conducted on fresh cadavers to identify the specific pedicle of the fibular head. The biceps femoris tendon was used to better stabilize the shoulder joint. The child recovered well and showed good progress in rehabilitation. On follow-up 1 year postoperatively, the shoulder joint remained limited, but showed no signs of substantial remodeling on x-ray.

{"title": "Angiogenesis: regulators and clinical applications.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a fundamental process in reproduction and wound healing. Under these conditions, neovascularization is tightly regulated. Unregulated angiogenesis may lead to several angiogenic diseases and is thought to be indispensable for solid tumor growth and metastasis. The construction of a vascular network requires different sequential steps including the release of proteases from \"activated\" endothelial cells with subsequent degradation of the basement membrane surrounding the existing vessel, migration of endothelial cells into the interstitial space, endothelial cell proliferation, and differentiation into mature blood vessels. These processes are mediated by a wide range of angiogenic inducers, including growth factors, chemokines, angiogenic enzymes, endothelial specific receptors, and adhesion molecules. Finally, when sufficient neovascularization has occurred, angiogenic factors are down-regulated or the local concentration of inhibitors increases. As a result, the endothelial cells become quiescent, and the vessels remain or regress if no longer needed. Thus, angiogenesis requires many interactions that must be tightly regulated in a spatial and temporal manner. Each of these processes presents possible targets for therapeutic intervention. Synthetic inhibitors of cell invasion (marimastat, Neovastat, AG-3340), adhesion (Vitaxin), or proliferation (TNP-470, thalidomide, Combretastatin A-4), or compounds that interfere with angiogenic growth factors (interferon-alpha, suramin, and analogues) or their receptors (SU6668, SU5416), as well as endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis (endostatin, interleukin-12) are being evaluated in clinical trials against a variety of solid tumors.

Histologically these tumors were associated with hepatocellular steatosis and focal proliferations of small vessels. To study the cellular origin of these lesions we inactivated VHL tissue-specifically in hepatocytes. Deletion of VHL in the liver resulted in severe steatosis, many blood-filled vascular cavities, and foci of increased vascularization within the hepatic parenchyma. These histopathological changes were similar to those seen in livers from mice heterozygous for the 1-lox allele. Hypoxia-inducible mRNAs encoding vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 1, and erythropoietin were up-regulated.

Loss of VHL protein function is associated with constitutive expression of mRNAs encoding hypoxia-inducible proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor. Overproduction of angiogenic factors might explain why VHL(-/-) RCC tumors are so highly vascularized, but whether this overproduction is sufficient for oncogenesis still remains unknown. In this report, we examined the activity of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), another VHL-regulated growth factor. We show that TGF-alpha mRNA and protein are hypoxia-inducible in VHL(-/-) RCC cells expressing reintroduced VHL. In addition to its overexpression by VHL(-/-) RCC cells, TGF-alpha can also act as a specific growth-stimulatory factor for VHL(-/-) RCC cells expressing reintroduced wild-type VHL, as well as primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, the likely site of origin of RCC. This role is in contrast to those of other growth factors overexpressed by VHL(-/-) RCC cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and TGF-beta1, which do not stimulate RCC cell proliferation. A TGF-alpha-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide blocked TGF-alpha production in VHL(-/-) RCC cells, which led to the dependence of those cells on exogenous growth factors to sustain growth in culture. Growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells was also significantly reduced by a drug that specifically inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor, the receptor through which TGF-alpha stimulates proliferation.

From C127I cells expressing wtVEGF(165), intensely vascularized and invasive tumors developed within 2 to 3 weeks.

No metastases were detected in mice carrying either wtVEGF or mutant VEGF expressing tumors. Thus, because proliferation-defective VEGF-mutants cannot induce angiogenesis, we conclude that the proliferation-inducing effect of VEGF is crucial for tumor angiogenesis and growth.

Antibodies against mouse heart, erythrocytes and lymphocytes and against the Forssman antigen were raised in the rat. Upon heterotopic heart transplantation the respective antisera were intravenously (i.v.) injected. Passive transfer of antiheart, antierythrocyte or antilymphocyte serum resulted in hyperacute rejection of the transplanted mouse heart. Subfractionation of the antiheart serum showed that the capacity to induce hyperacute rejection was carried by the immunoglobulin (Ig)G fraction. When antierythrocyte serum adsorbed with mouse erythrocytes was administered the cardiac grafts remained beating. To the contrary, antilymphocyte serum adsorbed with erythrocytes still had the capacity to induce hyperacute rejection. None of the rats that had previously been challenged with the Forssman antigen rejected their grafts hyperacutely. Subsequent investigations by electron microscopy revealed that the Forssman antigen is expressed on dendritic cells (DC) adjacent to the vessels, but not on the vascular endothelium, thus explaining the inability of the anti-Forssman serum to induce hyperacute rejection. Taken together, we have demonstrated the existence of several xenoantigens that can be targets for antibody-mediated rejection, suggesting that more than one relevant xenoantigen exists also in more distantly related combinations, such as the pig-to-human combination.", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of immunology", "date": "2001-02-13", "authors": ["M LGustavsson", "CJohnsson", "PAlbertsson", "DLukes", "L MSteen", "B RJohansson", "LMj\u00f6rnstedt", "JNorrby", "GTufveson", "MOlausson"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-3083.2001.00840.x"}

It may be due to uremic toxicity and the influence of peritoneal dialysate components. We intended to clarify to which degree peritoneal fibrosis and vascular changes were associated with the modalities of PD and the peritoneal transport characteristics.\nPeritoneal biopsies of 41 patients suffering from end-stage renal disease were examined. Sixteen patients were at the initiation of dialysis treatment, and 25 patients were studied during chronic PD treatment [9 patients on continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) and 16 patients on automatic PD (APD)]. Twenty nonuremic patients undergoing abdominal surgery served as the controls. Samples were taken from the parietal peritoneum under standardized conditions and were examined by light microscopy using different staining techniques, semiquantitative grading, and computer-based histomorphometry.\nA marked loss of mesothelial cells during PD treatment was only observed in cases with two or more preceding episodes of peritonitis, but an increase of the submesothelial fibrous tissue was a common finding and was related to the cumulative glucose load on PD. Patients on PD also had a significantly increased density of small vessels and capillaries in the submesothelial peritoneal layer (12.8 +/- 6.9 per field vs. 6.6 +/- 2.9 in normal controls, P < 0.01). The wall/lumen index of the vessels was increased indicating vascular sclerosis. The degree of vascularization correlated with the amount of fibrous tissue. Patients characterized as high transporters according to the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) had an increased submesothelial fibrous layer. Patients on APD tended to have an increased membrane diameter submesothelial stroma and vascularization (P = NS), although they were treated for a shorter period of time than the CAPD group.

This microangiographic technique was adopted here, for the first time, to study the effects of cadmium on cardiovascular development in zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish embryos were incubated in culture medium containing 100 microM cadmium from 5 h post fertilisation (hpf) to 48 hpf. At 48 hpf, embryos were examined for viability and occurrence of malformations. The 100 microM cadmium caused 32.21 +/- 3.65% mortality and 20.33 +/- 4.04% visible malformations in surviving embryos. In the remaining embryos with no visible signs of malformations, further assessments for less obvious abnormalities were performed. Assessments on craniofacial development were made by digital measurements on areas of brains and eyes. Cardiac development was assessed by immunostaining the heart with the antibody MF20 specific for myosin heavy chain. Body lengths of the embryos were also measured. Embryonic development of brains, eyes, hearts and body lengths of visibly healthy embryos in the cadmium treatment group showed no significant difference from the controls. Embryonic vasculature of these visibly healthy embryos was then studied by microinjecting fluorescent microbeads of diameter 0.02 microm into the circulation. All the cadmium treated embryos showed localised vascular defects in the dorsal aortae, segmental and cranial vessels while none of the control embryos showed any aberrant patterns in the networking of the vasculature. Improved image analyses on the anterior regions revealed that cadmium treated embryos had markedly less complex networks of cranial vessels with fewer vessels perfusing the craniofacial regions. The number of branch points in the vascular network was counted. In untreated embryos, there were 135.6 +/- 51 branches in the vasculature in entire body. In the cadmium treated embryos, there were 64.5+/-31 branches. The difference was significant when assessed with Student's t-test. It appeared that although cadmium did not cause any signs of external malformations in these visibly healthy embryos, nonetheless induced impaired branching and anastomsis of the cranial vessels. This study revealed, for the first time, that vital vascular structures in fish embryos could be affected by exposure to cadmium.

Among these, lowered oxygen pressure, hypoxia, is one of the most potent inducers/initiators of an angiogenic response. Significant evidence indicates that hypoxia acts as a morphogen during vascularization - inducing and shaping the recruitment and formation of new vascular beds through critical transcriptional control pathways. Recent advances indicate that extensive interactions occur between developing blood vessels, the tissues that they vascularize, and the interstitial environment to control and shape the establishment of new capillary beds. Identification of the processes that control the hypoxic response intracellularly has allowed an increasingly sophisticated understanding of angiogenesis as a process that is very closely tied to the microenvironment that it occurs in.

When comparisons were made between uteri carrying embryos in delay at the primitive streak stage and those growing more rapidly, many differences were noted. During delay the developing chorioallantoic placenta was generally smaller, contained a higher ratio of cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast, and had been invaded only to a limited extent on its embryonic side by mesoderm. Furthermore, much of the cytotrophoblast appeared relatively undifferentiated, randomly-oriented, linked primarily by primitive junctions, and lacked a basal lamina. In contrast, in placentae serving somite and limb-bud stage embryos, sizeable areas were noted that consisted only of more highly differentiated syncytiotrophoblast perforated by maternal vascular spaces (trophospongium). The first contact of the allantois with the developing placenta was also noted at the somite stage, and this initiated widespread invasion of the placenta by mesenchyme and allantoic blood vessels. Wherever this invasion had occurred, the cytotrophoblast between the mesenchyme and syncytiotrophoblast of the interhaemal barrier consisted of a single, polarized layer of more differentiated cells with an associated basal lamina. Eventually, all of the trophospongium was invaded by cytotrophoblast and vascularized fetal mesenchyme. These observations suggest that in addition to its germinal function, cytotrophoblast in this bat may play a major role in controlling mesenchymal invasion and angiogenesis on the embryonic side of the placenta. During the period of delay, highly invasive trophoblast is also released by the placenta. This invades the myometrium and sometimes extrauterine tissues via interstitial migration along maternal capillaries and veins.", "journal": "Placenta", "date": "2001-02-13", "authors": ["N KBadwaik", "J JRasweiler"], "doi": "10.1053/plac.2000.0590"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term performance of selectively biodegradable filament-wound vascular prostheses, comprising elastomeric poly(ether urethane) (Lycra) scaffolds and flexible, hydrophilic biodegradable coatings.\nTwo types of selectively biodegradable vascular grafts were manufactured, comprising a filament-wound Lycra scaffold, subsequently coated with a biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(lactic acid) (PELA) block copolymer. The two types of grafts differed in both the overall porosity of the scaffold and the hydrophilicity of the biodegradable constituent. A 60-mm-long and 6-mm-diameter filament-wound and polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts were implanted as interposition prostheses, randomly, at the right- and left-side carotid arteries.\nImplantation studies proved the grafts to be patent and pulsatile for periods of up to 3 months. Increasing the scaffold porosity and enhancing the hydrophilicity of the biodegradable component improved both the transmural tissue ingrowth process and the vascularization of the prosthesis wall. Also, a well-adhered peripheral tissue and a thin, uniform intima and endothelial lining were obtained. All ePTFE graft controls, although patent, were rather stiff and nonpulsatile. A thick pseudointima, poorly attached to the prosthesis inner surface, was observed. The compliance of the wet grafts was significantly higher than in the dry state, stemming mainly from the water-plasticizing effect on the biodegradable component. The grafts explanted after a period of 6 weeks exhibited compliance only slightly lower than that of the wet grafts. After 12 weeks, however, the hoop compliance was 20% lower than that prior to implantation. At 100 mm Hg, for example, the original compliance of the wet graft was 2.5%/100 mm Hg decreasing to 2.0%/100 mm Hg after a 3-month implantation. The compliance reduction with implantation is attributed to the ingrowth of the perigraft tissue as revealed by the histological study. A compliance of 2.0%/100 mm Hg is slightly better than that of a standard PTFE graft with an original compliance of 1.6%/100 mm Hg.

Moreover, grafting a mixed hamster/rat thymic epithelial cell graft could prevent the autoimmune syndrome.

Histopathologic analysis was obtained in one case. One additional referred case was included in this report.\nThe plugs were completely extruded from the punctal lumen 6 to 14 months after insertion after an otherwise uncomplicated postoperative course. All plugs were retained at the punctal margin by an encircling band of vascularized mucosal tissue originating from the canalicular lumen. The band consisted of connective tissue of canalicular mucosal origin, attached just below the junction of the punctal and canalicular epithelium. Mild mononuclear infiltration was present in the connective tissue component of the punctal region. There was no cytologic or architectural evidence of abnormal epithelium or connective tissue or of pyogenic granuloma.\nThese observations suggest that progressive lacrimal punctal plug extrusion may relate to mucosal dissection by the plug edges. We speculate that mechanical stress induced by eyelid closure on an improperly sized or placed implant may result in plug tilt. Subsequent epithelial hyperplasia further enhances the tilt, and the sharper edge of the conical bulb promotes separation of the canalicular mucosa from its distal luminal aspect.

Emerging evidence suggests that angiogenic stress of vascular trauma may induce mobilization of CEPs to the peripheral circulation. In this regard, we studied the kinetics of CEP mobilization in two groups of patients who experienced acute vascular insult secondary to burns or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In both burn and CABG patients, there was a consistent, rapid increase in the number of CEPs, determined by their surface expression pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), and AC133. Within the first 6 to 12 hours after injury, the percentage of CEPs in the peripheral blood of burn or CABG patients increased almost 50-fold, returning to basal levels within 48 to 72 hours. Mobilized cells also formed late-outgrowth endothelial colonies (CFU-ECs) in culture, indicating that a small, but significant, number of circulating endothelial cells were BM-derived CEPs. In parallel to the mobilization of CEPs, there was also a rapid elevation of VEGF plasma levels. Maximum VEGF levels were detected within 6 to 12 hours of vascular trauma and decreased to baseline levels after 48 to 72 hours. Acute elevation of VEGF in the mice plasma resulted in a similar kinetics of mobilization of VEGFR2(+) cells. On the basis of these results, we propose that vascular trauma may induce release of chemokines, such as VEGF, that promotes rapid mobilization of CEPs to the peripheral circulation.

METHODS: To evaluate its stability relative to conventional methods of fixation with interosseous wires or miniplates, an in vitro model using beech dowels was developed. Torsional stiffness and strength and compression stiffness and strength were examined. RESULTS: The compression test results showed that maximum strength of interosseous wires is significantly less than memory staples, which in turn are significantly weaker than titanium miniplates. Miniplates are significantly the most rigid form of fixation. Torsional testing showed no significant difference in strength between staples and miniplates and only a marginal difference in elasticity. Interosseous wires show a rapid decrease of strength and rigidity during torsional stress. CONCLUSION: When considering interosseous wires the least and miniplates the most stable form of fixation by which bone healing can occur, memory staples can provide enough stability to ensure consolidation.

{"title": "Estimating the selective advantage of mutant p53 tumour cells to repeated rounds of hypoxia.", "abstract": "The tumour suppressor gene, p53, plays an important role in tumour development. Under low levels of oxygen (hypoxia), cells expressing wild-type p53 undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis), whereas cells expressing mutations in the p53 gene may survive and express angiogenic growth factors that stimulate tumour vascularization. Given that cells expressing mutations in the p53 gene have been observed in many forms of human tumour, it is important to understand how both wild-type and mutant cells react to hypoxic conditions. In this paper a mathematical model is presented to investigate the effects of alternating periods of hypoxia and normoxia (normal oxygen levels) on a population of wild-type and mutant p53 tumour cells. The model consists of three coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the densities of the two cell types and the oxygen concentration and, as such, may describe the growth of avascular tumours in vitro and/or in vivo. Numerical and analytical techniques are used to determine how changes in the system parameters influence the time at which mutant cells become dominant within the population. A feedback mechanism, which switches off the oxygen supply when the total cell density exceeds a threshold value, is introduced into the model to investigate the impact that vessel collapse (and the associated hypoxia) has on the time at which the mutant cells become dominant within vascular tumours growing in vivo. Using the model we can predict the time it takes for a subpopulation of mutant p53 tumour cells to become the dominant population within either an avascular tumour or a localized region of a vascular tumour.

Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease, is characterized by a paucity of IL-4 and an abundance of synovial macrophage-derived mediators. Herein, the effect of a single injection of adenovirus-producing rat IL-4 (AxCAIL-4) or a control virus with no inserted gene was compared with the effect of PBS injection into rat ankles. Ankles were injected before arthritis onset or at maximal inflammation. Preventatively, AxCAIL-4 reduced adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA)- and/or AIA/adenoviral-induced ankle inflammation, decreasing articular index scores, ankle circumferences, paw volumes, radiographic scores, mean levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, the number of inflammatory cells, and the number of synovial blood vessels. Therapeutically, AxCAIL-4 also decreased ankle circumferences and paw volumes in comparison with a control virus with no inserted gene and PBS groups. After arthritis onset, mean levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and RANTES were decreased in AxCAIL-4 rat ankle homogenates compared with PBS-treated homogenates. Thus, increased expression of IL-4 via gene therapy administered in a preventative and/or therapeutic manner reduced joint inflammation, synovial cellularity, levels of proinflammatory cytokines, vascularization, and bony destruction in rat AIA, suggesting that a similar treatment in humans may be beneficial.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2001-01-06", "authors": ["J MWoods", "K JKatschke", "M VVolin", "J HRuth", "D CWoodruff", "M AAmin", "M AConnors", "HKurata", "KArai", "G KHaines", "PKumar", "A EKoch"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.166.2.1214"}
{"title": "Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 in corneal lymphangiogenesis.", "abstract": "Lymphangiogenesis has been reported in vascularized corneas. However, the molecular mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis in the cornea are still unclear. Since lymphatic vessels may contribute to a decreased success rate of keratoplasty in vascularized cornea by accelerating antigen recognition and graft rejection, elucidation of the mechanisms of corneal lymphangiogenesis will facilitate the inhibition of lymphatic vessels and may improve the outcome of keratoplasty. This study aimed to examine the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), which is the only endogenous lymphangiogenic factor reported so far, and one of its receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), in corneal lymphangiogenesis. A rat model was used in which silver nitrate application resulted in corneal circumferential neovascularization. The presence of lymphatic vessels in the rat injured cornea was examined with electron microscope. Corneal VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 mRNA levels were quantified with competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 proteins were studied in situ using immunohistochemical analysis. Electron microscopy revealed lymphatic vessels in the vascularized rat corneas. Competitive RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of VEGF-C mRNA in the rat cornea was normally absent, and was dramatically up-regulated 3 days after the injury, which gradually decreased. The VEGFR-3 expression in the rat cornea was minimally detected before the injury and was up-regulated 3 and 7 days after the injury. It was also minimally detected 2 and 4 weeks after the injury. In immunohistochemical analysis of the rat cornea 3 days after the injury, VEGF-C was mainly detected in inflammatory cells, and VEGFR-3 was demonstrated in several new vessels in the corneal stroma. These data suggest that VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 are pathophysiologically relevant endogenous factors in corneal lymphangiogenesis.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2001-01-03", "authors": ["TMimura", "SAmano", "TUsui", "YKaji", "TOshika", "YIshii"], "doi": "10.1006/exer.2000.0925"}
{"title": "Uncoupling of chondrocyte death and vascular invasion in mouse galectin 3 null mutant bones.", "abstract": "Galectin 3 is a beta-galactoside binding protein which localizes to the cytoplasm of proliferative, mature, and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate cartilage of developing long bones. To elucidate the function of galectin 3 during bone development, we examined the epiphyseal femurs and tibias of fetal mice carrying a null mutation for the galectin 3 gene. Detailed histological and ultrastructural studies identified abnormalities in the cells of the proliferative, mature, and hypertrophic zones and in the extracellular matrix of the hypertrophic zone, as well as a reduction in the total number of hypertrophic chondrocytes. The expression patterns of several chondrocyte and bone cell markers were analyzed and revealed a subtle modification of Ihh expression in the galectin 3 mutant growth plate. A striking difference was observed at the chondrovascular junction where many empty lacunae are present. In addition, large numbers of condensed chondrocytes exhibiting characteristic signs of cell death were found in the late hypertrophic zone, indicating that the rate of chondrocyte death is increased in the mutants. These results suggest a role for galectin 3 as a regulator of chondrocyte survival. In addition, this unique phenotype shows that the elimination of chondrocytes and vascular invasion can be uncoupled and indicates that galectin 3 may play a role in the coordination between chondrocyte death and metaphyseal vascularization.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2001-01-03", "authors": ["CColnot", "S SSidhu", "NBalmain", "FPoirier"], "doi": "10.1006/dbio.2000.9933"}

On the basis of experiments showing that tumors implanted into isolated perfused organs failed to develop whereas the same tumors implanted within 6 mm of blood vessels induced angiogenesis, grew, and metastasized (2,3), Folkman proposed that solid tumors are dependent on angiogenesis for growth beyond a few millimeters in size, and that increase in tumor diameter required a corresponding increase in vascularization (4).

{"title": "Surrogate markers of angiogenesis and metastasis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from a preexisting vascular network, is a complex multistep process under the control of positive and negative factors (bi1,bi2). Growth, progression, and metastasis of malignant tumors are angiogenesis-dependent processes (3-bi5). There is compelling evidence that development of angiogenic phenotype is a common pathway in the biology of tumor progression and metastasis, and the angiogenesis is correlated with other molecular mechanisms (e.g., the control of wild-type p53 on vascular endothelial growth factor or thrombospondin-1) (6,7). Angiogenesis can be directly determined, and so it may be useful as a biomarker (8-bi10). Tumor microvessel density (11-13) or tissue angiogenic factors expression may predict which patients are at different risk of metastasis (14-16), and serum levels of angiogenic factors may serve as tumor markers (17,18).At present the most widely used method to assess angiogenesis is quantification of intratumoral microvessel density (IMD) of the primary tumor by using specific markers for endothelial cells such as factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RA), anti-CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, PECAM), or anti-CD34 antibodies (19,22), using a standard immunocytochemistry immunoperoxidase technique to stain micro vessels (23,24). The basic principles of immunocytochemistry are described in Chapter 2 by Brooks and use of immunocytochemistry employing antibodies against factor VIII-related antigen and CD31 is described in Chapter 8 by Turner and Harris.", "journal": "Methods in molecular medicine", "date": "2001-01-01", "authors": ["GRanieri", "GGasparini"], "doi": "10.1385/1-59259-136-1:99"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis assays.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis-the formation of a vascular network-is essential for the support of a developing tumor when simple diffusion of nutrients is impossible. The ability of a solid tumor to achieve metabolic needs beyond simple diffusion is dependent on the development of this neovascular network. The process of angiogenesis lets the tumor become self-sufficient to grow, and also gives it the ability to metastasize. Growth factors added to human-vein endothelial cells in culture may demonstrate tubularization of cells, but this does not necessarily imply angiogenesis.

{"title": "Purification of Growth Factor mRNA in Renal Tissues:bFGF-2, FGF-2, TGF\u03b1, and EGFR.", "abstract": "Growth factors are polypeptides that induce cell mitogenicity, and thus play an important role in the etiology and progression of tumors (1). Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) constitute a family of structurally related polypeptides of 146 amino acids, which exhibit a wide spectrum of biologic activities, including angiogenesis or the formation of a vascular network. FGFs are mitogenic towards many mesodermal and ectodermal cell types, and can also induce and/or inhibit differentiation of cells (2). These heparin-binding factors are categorized as FGF-1 through FGF-10. Acidic FGF, or FGF-1, is found mostly in brain and other neural tissues. Basic FGF, or FGF- 2, a protein of 18 kDa mw, is one of the most ubiqitous growth factors. It is found in numerous benign and cancerous human and animal tissues, including kidney, prostate, and bladder (3-6). In some cases it has also been demonstrated to have potential as a tumor marker (7-11). One group reported greater recovery of both FGF-2 protein and FGF-2 mRNA from renal-cancer tissue compared to equal amounts of normal renal tissue (5). Furthermore, when purified FGF-2 from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is added exogenously to other established renal tumorcell lines and endothelial cell lines, it demonstrates significant mitogenic activity (6). Thus, renal tumors may use FGF-2 in an autocrine manner to sustain themselves.", "journal": "Methods in molecular medicine", "date": "2001-01-01", "authors": ["J HMydlo"], "doi": "10.1385/1-59259-144-2:151"}

Ag-activated donor-specific CD4 T cells are major initiators and effectors in the allograft rejection response. Interfering with the intragraft homing of activated CD4 T cells may represent a novel therapeutic approach in transplant recipients. We have developed a FACS-based short-term homing assay that allows tracing in vitro-generated Ag-reactive CD4 T cells after adoptive transfer in test rat recipients. Allospecific cell lines were preincubated with anti-alpha(4)beta(1) or anti-alpha(L)beta(2) mAb, because of enhanced expression of both integrin receptors after alloactivation. The pretreated Lewis(BN) lymphocytes were carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester labeled and adoptively transferred into Lewis rat recipients of Brown Norway kidney allografts. The injection of equal numbers of PKH-26-labeled untreated cells allowed quantitative comparison of both populations in the same animal. Ex vivo treatment with anti-alpha(4)beta(1) mAb diminished intragraft infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells by 85% in a donor-specific fashion. In contrast, treatment with anti-alpha(L)beta(2) mAb did not affect intragraft cell sequestration. Hence, blocking alpha(4)beta(1) integrin interactions represents a novel strategy in preventing local intragraft recruitment of Ag-reactive CD4 T cells in transplant recipients.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2000-12-21", "authors": ["M HHammer", "YZhai", "MKatori", "TRitter", "H DVolk", "A JCoito", "J WKupiec-Weglinski"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.166.1.596"}
{"title": "The biology of melanoma micrometastases.", "abstract": "The biology and significance of micrometastases remain poorly understood. Whether such deposits represent hypothetical \"dormant\" metastases, simply the earliest metastases recognizable, or both has not been resolved. Attempting to answer the latter question among many others, we carried out studies on the rates of proliferation, and microvessel counts in melanoma micrometastases taken from sentinel lymph nodes as compared to conventional melanoma lymph node macrometastases. We found that these micrometastases were not vascularized and had low (and comparable) rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting a steady or dormant state. On the other hand, the macrometastases were fully vascularized and more proliferative, i.e., they had rates of proliferation that were significantly higher compared to the micrometastases and rate of apoptosis. How micrometastases develop is also poorly understood. Tumor cells are thought to arrive in lymph nodes and other sites through the blood and lymphatic circulation and to extravasate. However, in addition to the latter explanation, another mechanism may be operable which we have proposed as extravascular migratory metastasis. In studies of metastatic melanoma we have identified melanoma cells positioned on the surface of endothelial cells both by light and electron microscopy. We have also identified ultrastructurally the presence of an amorphous matrix interposed between the latter two cell types that shows immunostaining for laminin and, recently, the beta-2 chain of laminin. Thus, we currently believe that the latter form of \"free\" laminin may play a role in this proposed mechanism of metastasis and thus in the formation of micrometastases.", "journal": "Recent results in cancer research.

{"title": "The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor HESR1 regulates endothelial cell tube formation.", "abstract": "Human endothelial cells can be induced to form capillary-like tubular networks in collagen gels. We have used this in vitro model and representational difference analysis to identify genes involved in the formation of new blood vessels. HESR1 (HEY-1/HRT-1/CHF-2/gridlock), a basic helix-loop-helix protein related to the hairy/enhancer of split/HES family, is absent in migrating and proliferating cultures of endothelial cells but is rapidly induced during capillary-like network formation. HESR1 is detectable in all adult tissues and at high levels in well vascularized organs such as heart and brain. Its expression is also enriched in aorta and purified capillaries. Overexpression of HESR1 in endothelial cells down-regulates vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) mRNA levels and blocks proliferation, migration, and network formation. Interestingly, reduction of expression of HESR1 by antisense oligonucleotides also blocks endothelial cell network formation in vitro. Finally, HESR1 expression is altered in several breast, lung, and kidney tumors. These data are consistent with a temporal model for HESR1 action where down-regulation at the initiation of new vessel budding is required to allow VEGFR2-mediated migration and proliferation, but re-expression of HESR1 is necessary for induction of tubular network formation and continued maintenance of the mature, quiescent vessel.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2000-11-09", "authors": ["A MHenderson", "S JWang", "A CTaylor", "MAitkenhead", "C CHughes"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M008506200"}
