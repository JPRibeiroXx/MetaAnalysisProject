Three-dimensional visualization of vasculature in whole tissues using confocal microscopy is a valuable tool for examining cellular and architectural changes accompanying altered vascular function. The relative affinities of plant lectins for carbohydrate moieties present on luminal surfaces of endothelial cells can be used to characterize endothelium in distinctive physiologic and pathologic states. Perivascular cells that wrap around blood endothelial cells can be visualized using antibodies immunoreactive with alpha-smooth muscle actin. Similarly, lymphatic endothelial cells can be detected by antibodies immunoreactive to the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1.

{"title": "Can thymic tissue induce tolerance to kidney allografts?", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effect of donor thymic tissue to induce tolerance in thymokidney allografts, transplanted to thymectomized cross-bred canines.\nSeven pairs of transplant donors and recipients were selected from 3- to 4-month-old cross-bred canines with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatches. Recipients underwent partial thymectomy 4 weeks before transplantation and received an autologous thymic graft under the renal capsule, which had been engrafted in the donors 3 months before transplantation (thymokidney). Successful engraftment with evidence of thymocyte development in the donors was determined by gross and histologic examination at the time of transplantation. Biopsy specimens were obtained at the transplant day and 3 months after transplantation and were studied histologically for evidence of hyperacute or acute rejection.\nAt 90 days after the operation, all 7 juvenile thymic grafts had developed with normal thymic structure under the renal capsule. Hyperacute rejection was not observed in allografts, and all of them were functioning until the end of follow-up; however, all of the allografts showed acute cell-mediated rejection 3 months after transplantation.\nNo tolerance was induced by vascularized donor thymokidneys in MHC-mismatched canines. The advantages of tolerance over chronic immunosuppression are so great that a potentially tolerogenic approach such as thymic transplantation would seem worthy of further investigations on large animal models. To evaluate the beneficial effects of thymic tissue in tolerance induction, utilizing a short course, low-dose adjuvant immunosuppressant to this regimen and/or application of in-bred MHC-matched canines is suggested.", "journal": "Urology journal", "date": "2007-07-03", "authors": ["SaeedShakeri", "AlirezaAminsharifi", "AbdolazizKhezri", "AhmadMonabbati", "NaderTanideh"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Modulation of corneal vascularization.", "abstract": "Avascularity of normal cornea is a result of homeostasis between anti-angiogenic and pro-angiogenic stimuli. Disruption of this delicate balance during corneal wound healing can lead to pathological corneal vascularization. Several unique characteristics in the ocular surface epithelia modulate corneal avascularity. Normal cornea contains heparan sulfate to prevent the release of potent angiogenic cytokines, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) from the Bowman's layer. Potent angiostatic factors, such as endostatin and angiostatin, can be produced from degradation of corneal extracelluar matrix. In contrast, conjunctiva contains angiogenic cytokines, such as bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition to regulating release of angiogenic and angiostatic cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteolytic enzymes can modulate corneal vascularization via matrix degradation to allow endothelial migration and tissue remodeling. When the cornea becomes vascularized, inflammatory cells and mediators gain uninhibited access to the cornea, thus rendering immune sensitization and increased risk of corneal graft rejection. Novel therapies targeting angiogenic cytokines or MMPs have been shown to suppress corneal vascularization effectively in animal models, and may have therapeutic potential for clinical use.", "journal": "The ocular surface", "date": "2007-01-12", "authors": ["Andrew J WHuang", "De-QuanLi", "Cheng-HuiLi", "Tie-YanShang", "EleutHernandez"], "doi": "10.1016/s1542-0124(12)70253-7"}

This study elucidates the anatomic conditions and pathologic process of retinal detachment associated with colobomas.\nThe records, including histologic slides, of 14 children (1 day to 17 months old) and 7 adults (17 to 78 years old) with colobomas were examined.\nIn children, colobomas were associated with lethal malformations. The extracolobomatous inner retinal layers extended centrally, forming the intercalary membrane. Duplication of the outer retinal layers and a horizontal shift of M\u00fcllerian glia created a triangle and a locus minoris resistentiae adjacent to the laterally displaced pigment epithelium. Part of the locus was an incomplete layer of photoreceptors excluding M\u00fcllerian glia. In adults, atrophy of the intercalary membrane, manifested as central schisis, thinning of the neuroepithelium, and hole formation, was related to a paucity of blood vessels within and underneath the intercalary membrane and the size of colobomas. The margins featured blood vessels, pigment epithelial hypertrophy, and choroidal and scleral thickening in a compact, intertwined arrangement.\nGlial atrophy, schisis, and hole formation in the intercalary membrane and separation of the locus minoris resistentiae from the pigment epithelium can disrupt barriers to fluid flow and set the stage for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. That process is exacerbated by scleral ectasia, increasing vitreous traction at the margin, and retinovascular ischemia within the intercalary membrane.

At exploratory laparotomy a haemorrhagic infiltration was found in Retzius' space and the anterior wall of the bladder, which appeared thickened and swollen below the peritoneum. We tried to drain the haematoma, however, we failed to drain it completely because of the large blood infiltration in the bladder wall. Clinical and ultrasound follow-up examinations showed a progressive reduction of the haematoma which completely disappeared nine months later. The haemodynamic changes occurring during pregnancy and labour, associated with strong mechanical stress, seem to be among the major causative factors of haematoma formation. Moreover, the venous load in the pelvic vascular system is increased during pregnancy; a stress-induced increase in venous blood pressure might play a prominent role, especially in cases of venous ectasia, where the resistance of blood vessel walls is reduced. Intraoperative evidence seemed to suggest a haemorrhage secondary to the rupture of the venous vessels in the Santorini plexus. The rupture was probably caused by the thrust of the fetal head, associated with abnormality or fragility of the blood vessels, or by some pathologic changes occurring in the anatomical structures during pregnancy, which could not be accurately defined because of the severity and degree of the haematoma infiltration found intraoperatively.", "journal": "Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis", "date": "2006-05-09", "authors": ["StefaniaFieni", "RobertoBerretta", "CarlaMerisio", "MauroMelpignano", "DandoloGramellini"], "doi": null}

Although, usually retro-pyelic artery trajectory is arcade like, we found this aspect in 38.46% cases. In 19.71% cases the trajectory has an italic \"S\" or double arcade aspect, in 31.73% cases, retro-pyelic artery is terminated by bifurcation, trifurcation in 9.13% cases and ramification in four branches in only 0.96% cases. Regardless of it's aspect, in most of the cases (31.73%), retro-pyelic artery branches vascularize the posterior half of the kidney, in 28.36% cases, just the posterior middle part of the kidney and in the remaining cases does not vascularize the superior pole (18.75%) or the inferior pole (21.15%).", "journal": "Revista medico-chirurgicala a Societatii de Medici si Naturalisti din Iasi", "date": "2006-04-13", "authors": ["ElenaSapte", "PBordei", "MihaelaPundiche", "IBulbuc"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Spreading vasodilatation in resistance arteries.", "abstract": "Focal application of vasodilators such as acetylcholine (ACh), which evoke arterial hyperpolarization, cause coordinated dilatation along the length of an artery with minimal decay with distance from the site of application. This phenomenon is called spreading vasodilatation. In an artery wall, the endothelium is separated from the surrounding smooth muscle cell layers by an internal elastic lamina (IEL). Adjacent endothelial cells are strongly connected via gap junctions, which can allow direct communication between the cells, including the passage of small molecules and electrical current. Direct communication between an endothelial cell and a smooth muscle cell, through a hole in the IEL, has recently been observed in arteries. Spreading vasodilatation is associated with a spread of hyperpolarization which may be a key mechanism responsible for this spreading arterial vasodilatation. Endothelial cells appear to play an important role in such spread, even though the facilitating mechanisms underlying this spread are as yet unclear. These spreading responses are likely to have an important physiological role in the coordination of blood flow within a vascular network.", "journal": "Journal of smooth muscle research = Nihon Heikatsukin Gakkai kikanshi", "date": "2006-03-25", "authors": ["HiromichiTakano", "Kim ADora", "Christopher JGarland"], "doi": "10.1540/jsmr.41.303"}

Our objective was to search for factors influencing outcome and identify appropriate indications.\nBetween 1984 and 1999, 103 patients were treated with a non-vascularized corticocancellous graft. Fifty-seven patients (58 wrists) were retained for analysis (4 deaths, 30 not attending follow-up consultation far from their residence, and 12 lost to follow-up). Mean follow-up was 106 months (range 19-212). Mean age was 36 years (20-62). Mean time to diagnosis of fracture was 35 months (6-252); the fracture was not recognized initially in 45 patients. According to the Schernberg classification, fractures were localized in zone II (n = 11), zone III (n = 40), and zone IV (n = 7). Using the Alnot classification, nonunion was grade I (n = 13), grade IIA (n = 20), grade IIB (n = 22), grade IIIA (n = 2), and grade IIIB (n = 1). Mean immobilization after grafting was 2.7 months.\nAt three months, bone healing was achieved in 42 wrists. Thirty-six patients were very satisfied, 18 satisfied and four not satisfied. Twenty-seven patients presented significant pain at the graft harvesting site which regressed in all. There were no harvesting sequelae. Compared with the healthy wrist, we noted reduced flexion (8.7 degrees on average), extension (12.8 degrees on average), and radial inclination (10.5 degrees on average). Other wrist motions were not affected, particularly pronation and supination. The index of carpal height was 0.54 on average (range 0.47-0.57); carpal height was diminished in nine wrists. The radiolunate angle was 4.8 degrees on average (-17 degrees to +27 degrees). Dorsal intercalated segmental instability (DISI) was noted in twenty wrists. Bone healing was not achieved in eleven wrists, seven of which presented initial necrosis of the proximal pole. Pain improved in all patients. Persistence of DISI favored osteoarthritic degeneration.\nWith this technique, we achieved bone healing in 81% of the cases. Non-vascularized grafting cannot provide cure in the event of advanced osteoarthrtic degeneration. Correction of DISI appears to be an indispensable element for the prevention of osteoarthritis.

We have previously shown that chronic hypomagnesemia did not induce any inflammatory process in the lung, hence neither EC activation, nor lung remodelling. In the present study we have investigated the effects of allogeneic blood perfusion on lungs from magnesium-deficient mice in our experimental model of isolated mouse lung. After 3h of isogeneic or allogeneic perfusion, no inflammatory process was detected by histochemical examination of lung tissue; the mRNA levels of the adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-2 in lung tissue, determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were similar, and the expression of E-selectin and I-Ab antigen on EC by immunohistochemical staining was undetectable. All of these markers were shown to be dramatically increased after allogeneic perfusion of lung from magnesium-non deficient mice. Our results clearly show that allogeneic perfusion of lungs from magnesium-deficient mice cannot induce EC activation or lung inflammation, indicating that hypomagnesemia in donors does not constitute an additional risk for allograft outcome and might allow to lighten the recipient's immunosuppressive treatment.", "journal": "Magnesium research", "date": "2006-03-22", "authors": ["FSabbagh", "FLecerf", "PMaurois", "PBac", "MGerman-Fattal"], "doi": null}

The prevalence of this pathology is very variable and fluctuates between 1.7% and 30% of all thyroid damages. The actual classification is provided by the radiologic examination of the chest and, above all, by the new techniques of imaging.\nIn the period between January 1998 and December 2003, 332 patients with thyroid pathology have been treated surgically. Forthy-five (13.5%) of these were afflicted with a cervico-mediastinic goiter. In 32/45 (71.1%) cases a total thyroidectomy has been performed by collar carving in accordance with Kocher; in 11/45 (24.5%) cases an hemithyroidectomy has been performed by collar incision; in 2/45 (4.4%) cases, already submitted to surgical intervention of isthmus-lobectomy a totalization has been performed.\nThe surgical technique foresees always an anterior collar neck incision. This way of access is to prefer in the substernal goiters, both for the presence of a cervical vascularization easy to control and for the possibility, nearly always realizable, to dislocate the goiter by that way. As for what concerns the results of the histological examination, in 2/45 (4.5%) cases it has been set a diagnosis of follicular carcinoma (one of them surely invading and the other, leastly invading), in 3/45 (6.6%) cases papillary carcinoma, in 4/45 (8.8%) cases colloido-cystic goiter, in 33/45 (73.5%) cases micro-macrofollicular hyperplasia (in one of which contemporarily compromise from lymphoma of Hodgkin); in 3/45 (6.6%) cases of adenomatous hyperplasia of the thyroid.\nThe surgical approach has been in all cases the collar neck incision in accordance to Kocher, and it has never been necessary to associate a sternotomy or thoracotomy. After the intervention, in all the patients the symptomatology tied to the mediastinal compression has disappeared. The goiter showed signs of neoplastic degeneration in 11.1% of the cases, with prevalence of the papillary carcinoma in the 6.6% and, in the remaining 4.5%, of follicular carcinoma.

Yet, despite the production of angiogenic factors within ischemic tissues, compensatory growth of new vessels fails to provide adequate vascularization. Thus, we hypothesized that local factors counter efficient revascularization. Whereas ischemia is often considered to be synonymous with an oxygen deficit, it is also associated with a concomitant local elevation of carbon dioxide (CO2). Although studies suggest that hypercapnia impacts tissue neovascularization, its significance relative to the abundantly described effects of hypoxia and its underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hypercapnia on blood vessel growth in models of developmental and ischemic neovascularization. Acute and prolonged CO2 exposure inhibited developmental neovascularization of the rodent retina, as well as revascularization of the ischemic retina. Hypercapnia induced early increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase and nitrative stress, associated with astrocyte impairment and endothelial cell death, as well as downregulation of the proangiogenic prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3.

Some experts believe that this phenomenon occurs naturally in human beings, specifically during recovery from a myocardial infarction. Recently, stem cells have been used with the therapeutic intention of regenerating damaged tissues. Cardiac experiments, mainly with adult homologous stem cells, have proved that this therapy is safe and may improve myocardial vascularization and pump function. We review current fundamental concepts regarding the normal development of embryonic stem cells into myocardial tissue and the heart as a whole.

We show here that a bovine bone-derived growth factor mixture (GFM) of TGFbetas, BMPs, and no more than 0.1% aFGF can initiate a dose-dependent angiogenic response in subcutaneously implanted Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel plugs that includes abundant smooth muscle actin positive (SMA+) tubes and functional CD31+, red blood cell filled, capillaries. Tube forming activity of the single factors, recombinant bFGF and bone-derived TGF-beta2, were comparable to GFM, but only the bone-derived factors were able to create a larger fraction of SMA+ tubes than Matrigel alone at an equal dose. Basic FGF formed a greater number of RBC-filled capillaries within the plugs than GFM or TGF-beta2 at the highest doses, although GFM created RBC-filled capillaries that penetrated deeper into the plugs than bFGF. However, bFGF showed the greatest number of non-cell-lined, RBC-filled pools, suggestive of vessel rupture, and the largest number of plugs showing signs of fluid accumulation in the form of large, cell-lined clefts in the implants. TGF-beta2 showed less RBC-filled pools, but a significant number of implants with signs of fluid accumulation. At high doses of GFM penetration by blood vessels and mesenchymal cells was obstructed by cartilage development within the plugs accompanied by a prominent band of SMA+ granulation tissue with abundant RBC-filled capillaries encapsulating the implants. Thus, GFM is also capable of dramatically remodeling the vascular system in the interstitial space surrounding the plug. These results show that GFM is capable of inducing the formation of a more mature vascular system than that formed by the single factors bFGF and TGFbeta-2.

Hair follicles represent an efficient reservoir for the penetration of topically applied substances with subsequent targeting of distinct cell populations, e.g., nestin-expressing follicular bulge cells. The volume of this reservoir can be determined by differential stripping technology. The follicular penetration processes are significantly influenced by the state of the follicular infundibulum; recent experimental investigations could demonstrate that it is essential to distinguish between open and closed hair follicles. Topically applied substances can only penetrate into open hair follicle. Knowledge of follicular penetration is of high clinical relevance for functional targeting of distinct follicular regions. Human hair follicles show a hair-cycle-dependent variation of the dense neuronal and vascular network. Moreover, during hair follicle cycling with initiation of anagen, newly formed vessels occur. Thus, the potential of nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells to form neurons and blood vessels was investigated.", "journal": "The journal of investigative dermatology.

It was found that as compared with normal myometrium, the proliferating uterine myoma had an extensive peripheral vascularization of myomatous nodule with a decreased resistance index, which is a marker of myocyte proliferative activity in the myomatous nodule. These data were supported by histological findings in material obtained at operations, which demonstrated the signs of proliferative growth. Using EPR, it was shown that uterine myoma was characterized by an estrogen-dependent intensification of the processes of free-radical oxidation, which correlated with a degree of hormonal changes. Accumulation of free-radical oxidation activators and of ions of ferritin-unbound iron in the tumor tissue is indicative of the intensification of proliferative activity of the cells of uterine myoma and is one of the risk factors of neoplastic growth. Hyperestrogenemia, characteristic for the myoma development, is one of the reasons for NO synthesis activation, which, in the oxidative stress, is transformed into cytotoxic peroxinitrite, contributing to further intensification of an oxidative stress and malignant transformation of tissues.", "journal": "Morfologiia (Saint Petersburg, Russia)", "date": "2005-12-31", "authors": ["M VPa\u012dlodze", "T VSanikidze"], "doi": null}

The sequelae of inflammation, whether occurring before corneal transplantation or subsequently, exert a profound influence by predisposing the graft to rejection. Of the developments that have been instrumental in reducing rejection in vascularized organ transplantation, living-related donation is not an option for corneal transplantation. However, HLA matching may be beneficial and requires reassessment. The evidence base to support the use of systemic immunosuppressive agents in corneal transplantation is thin, and topical glucocorticosteroids remain the drugs of choice to prevent or reverse rejection episodes. Experimental approaches to local allospecific immunosuppression, including the use of antibody-based reagents and gene therapy, are being developed but may be difficult to translate from the laboratory bench to the clinic.\nCorneal allograft rejection remains a major cause of graft failure.

The poorly vascularized necrotic tissue may cause pain and/or instability, and it cannot resist infection well, which may result in secondary osteomyelitis. When these processes affect the cervical spine, the resulting instability and neurological deficits can be devastating, and immediate reestablishment of spinal stability is paramount. Reconstruction of the cervical spine can be particularly challenging in this subgroup of patients in whom the spine is poorly vascularized after radical surgery, high-dose irradiation, and infection. The authors report three cases of cervical spine osteoradionecrosis following radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies. Two patients suffered secondary osteomyelitis, severe spinal deformity, and spinal cord compression. These patients underwent surgery in which a vascularized fibular graft and instrumentation were used to reconstruct the cervical spine; subsequently hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy was instituted. Fusion occurred, spinal stability was restored, and neurological dysfunction resolved at the 2- and 4-year follow-up examinations, respectively. The third patient experienced pain and dysphagia but did not have osteomyelitis, spinal instability, or neurological deficits. He underwent HBO therapy alone, with improved symptoms and imaging findings. Hyperbaric oxygen is an essential part of treatment for osteoradionecrosis and may be sufficient by itself for uncomplicated cases, but surgery is required for patients with spinal instability, spinal cord compression, and/or infection. A vascularized fibular bone graft is a very helpful adjunct in these patients because it adds little morbidity and may increase the rate of spinal fusion.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

VEGF(165) signaling through VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) is a highly regulated process involving the formation of a tertiary complex with glypican (GYP)-1 and neuropilin (NRP)-1. Both VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression are reduced in emphysematous lungs; however, the mechanism of regulation of VEGF(165) signaling through the VEGFR-2 complex in response to cigarette smoke exposure in vivo, and in smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is still unknown. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke exposure disrupts the VEGF(165)-VEGFR-2 complex, a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of emphysema. We show that cigarette smoke exposure reduces NRP-1 and GYP-1 as well as VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels in rat lungs and that VEGF, VEGFR-2, GYP-1, and NRP-1 expression in the lungs of both smokers and patients with COPD are also reduced compared with nonsmokers. Moreover, our data suggest that specific inhibition of VEGFR-2 alone with NVP-AAD777 would appear not to result in emphysema in the adult rat lung. As both VEGF(165) and VEGFR-2 expression are reduced in emphysematous lungs, decreased GYP-1 and NRP-1 expression may yet further disrupt VEGF(165)-VEGFR-2 signaling. Whether or not this by itself is critical for inducing endothelial cell apoptosis and decreased vascularization of the lung seen in emphysema patients is still unclear at present.

The cervical skin defect was closed with an island deltopectoral flap. A soft stent was kept in the neotrachea for 3 weeks, and a tracheostomy tube was left beneath it. The tracheostomy was subsequently closed with local advancement flaps, and the patient currently maintains an excellent airway.\nPrefabricated composite free flaps are an attractive option for certain challenging cases of airway reconstruction.", "journal": "The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology", "date": "2005-12-20", "authors": ["Marita STeng", "Benjamin DMalkin", "Mark LUrken"], "doi": "10.1177/000348940511401102"}

The neonatal rat retina is incompletely vascularized at birth, providing a model for the human premature infant retina and for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We hypothesized that T4 supplementation would accelerate vascular development of normal neonatal rat retina.\nTwo hundred twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were raised in litters of 10 in room air and received either 0.05 microg/g, 0.5 microg/g, or 1.0 microg/g of intraperitoneal T4 or saline control beginning on day 1 of life for 3 days, 7 days, or 3 days followed by 4 days recovery. Rats were sacrificed on either day 4 or day 8 of life. Left eyes were fixed, retinae dissected and ADPase-stained. Flat mounted retinae were digitized and total retinal areas and retinal vascular density were evaluated in a masked manner. Serum T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured at each time point.\nRetinal vascular density was reduced in animals receiving daily 1 microg/g T4 compared with saline controls after 3 days of T4 (16.8 +/- 1.4 vessels/mm vs. 18.3 +/- 1.3 vessels/mm, p = 0.04) and 7 days of T4 (14.4 +/- 1.3 vessels/mm vs. 16.8 +/- 1.1 vessels/mm, p < 0.0006). However, retinal vascular density returned to normal after 3 days of treatment and 4 days of recovery. Vascularized retinal area was reduced in animals receiving 1 microg/g T4 for 3 days followed by 4 days recovery compared with saline controls (85 +/- 6% vs. 92 +/- 3%, p = 0.002). At lower doses of T4 (0.05 microg/g and 0.5 microg/g for 3 or 7 days) and at 1 microg/g T4 for 7 days, there was no effect on vascularized retinal area. Serum T4 levels were increased, with corresponding TSH suppression, after T4 treatment for 3 or 7 days. Serum IGF-1 levels were unaffected by T4 supplementation.\nSystemic T4 supplementation at 1 microg/g per day was detrimental to retinal vascular development in neonatal animals.

The histopathological hallmarks of malignant astrocytomas are microvascular proliferation and formation of vascular entities, which are referred to as \"glomeruloid bodies.\" The significance of glomeruloid bodies and the molecular mechanisms driving the abnormal vascular architecture in malignant astrocytomas are not understood. We have observed that overexpression of angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) in both subcutaneous and intracranial xenograft models of malignant astrocytomas reproduces many of the vascular features of these tumors, including glomeruloid bodies. To confirm that the formation of glomeruloid bodies was directly dependent on Ang1, we performed experiments where levels of Ang1 expression were regulated under tetracycline control, and we found a direct correlation between levels of Ang1 expression and the occurrence of glomeruloid bodies in xenografts. Additionally, we inhibited the action of Ang1 by blocking its cognate receptor Tie2, and we found that the formation of glomeruloid bodies was inhibited.

After 48 h of incubation, HET0016 reduced the proliferation of 9L in vitro by 55%, and this was associated with a fall in p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase phosphorylation and increased apoptosis. HET0016 inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced proliferation and diminished phosphorylation of PDGF receptors. A stable 20-HETE analog increased 9L cell proliferation. In vivo, chronic administration of HET0016 (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 2 weeks reduced the volume of 9L tumors by 80%. This was accompanied by a 4-fold reduction in the mitotic index, a 3- to 4-fold increase in the apoptotic index, and a approximately 50% decrease in vascularization in the tumor. HET0016 treatment increased mean survival time of the animals from 17 to 22 days. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry experiments indicated that neither 9L cells grown in vitro nor 9L tumors removed produce 20-HETE when incubated with arachidonic acid. The normal surrounding brain tissue, however, avidly makes 20-HETE, and this activity is selectively inhibited by HET0016. These results suggest that HET0016 may be the prototype of a class of antigrowth compounds that may be efficacious for treating malignant brain tumors. In vivo, it may act in part by inhibiting the formation of 20-HETE by the surrounding tissue.

Monitoring the expression during placental development revealed that in first trimester and term placentae both molecules are equally expressed at the RNA level.

To identify the contribution of the different vascular compartments in the diabetic impairment of vascularization, we employed streptozotocin- and control-treated 3-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice in an isogeneic pinnal cardiac allograft model, revealing a significant delay in vascularization of wild-type cardiac tissue transplanted into diabetic mice. To investigate the basis of this impairment, the function of diabetic bone marrow cells was tested by transplantation of bone marrow cells isolated from diabetic and control mice into intact, unirradiated 18-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice, which have impaired function of both EPCs and peripheral endothelial cells. Importantly, cells derived from control, but not diabetic, bone marrow integrated into transplanted cardiac allografts. To assess the contribution of diabetic changes in the local vasculature, diabetic mice were treated with pinnal injections of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB, which promotes cardiac angiogenesis in wild-type mice. However, whereas PDGF-AB enhanced allograft function in control mice, the activity of the cardiac transplants in the PDGF-AB-treated diabetic mice was significantly decreased. To decipher the potential interactions between systemic bone marrow-derived cells and local vascular pathways, diabetic mice were transplanted with wild-type bone marrow cells with or without PDGF-AB pinnal pretreatment, resulting in improved allograft function and donor cell recruitment only in the combination treatment arm.

{"title": "Infra-inguinal revascularization surgical site infections: Australasian benchmark.", "abstract": "Infra-inguinal revascularization surgery remains one of the most commonly performed major vascular procedures in contemporary practice. Surgical site infections (SSI) are a common cause of morbidity in this patient cohort and generate high rates of limb loss and mortality when vascular graft involvement occurs. An overall reduction in North American SSI has been attributed to the establishment of national benchmarks. A comparable Australasian benchmark does not exist. The purpose of the present study was to assess the methods used by Australasian vascular units to determine SSI rates and to instigate the development of an acceptable benchmark.\nA structured questionnaire pertaining to SSI after infra-inguinal revascularization surgery was sent to 26 Australasian vascular units. Data requested included the number and type of lower extremity revascularization procedures performed. Units were also asked to report the methods employed for defining and detecting wound infections and to document their SSI rate. The incidence of SSI causation by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was also sought.\nThe total number of revascularizations performed annually varied from 28 to 179 between units. The SSI rates ranged from 0 to 38%. The incidence of MRSA involvement varied from <1% to 56%. The SSI surveillance methodology varied considerably between units.\nThe present study confirms the significant incidence of SSI after infra-inguinal revascularization surgery in contemporary vascular practice. Standardized definitions and surveillance protocols are required to facilitate inter- and intrahospital comparisons.

{"title": "Role of the vascular endothelial growth factor isoforms in retinal angiogenesis and DiGeorge syndrome.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to characterize the specific role of the various vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms in different aspects of blood vessel formation: vessel outgrowth, arterial and venous differentiation, and vascular remodeling and patterning. Although the role of VEGF in the early stages of vascular assembly has been studied extensively, its role in the maturation stage, involving vascular remodeling and patterning, as well as in the establishment of arteries and veins, remains enigmatic. The three major VEGF isoforms are known to differ in their solubility (VEGF120 is freely soluble and VEGF188 is completely matrix-bound, while VEGF164 has intermediate properties) and receptor binding properties (VEGF164 does and VEGF120 does not bind to neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1)), but the specific biological function of these VEGF isoforms is largely unknown. To study the differential function of the VEGF isoforms in these particular aspects of vascular development, three different transgenic mice were generated: VEGF(120/120), VEGF(164/164) and VEGF(188/188), that express only VEGF120, VEGF164 or VEGF188, respectively. Postnatal blood vessel formation was studied in the retina, which is an excellent organ to study angiogenesis because of the unique structural properties of the retinal vascular bed. Subsequently, the cardiac outflow tract and pharyngeal arch system were analyzed during embryogenesis, since vascular remodeling and patterning play a crucial role in the establishment of the mature configuration of these vascular structures. Both vascular systems are of major clinical relevance. Retinal neovascularization, the major cause of blindness, is a complication of a variety of common eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, and vascular occlusions. Abnormal remodeling of the pharyngeal arch system and the cardiac outflow tract, on the other hand, results in life-threatening congenital cardiovascular defects, and occurs in association with craniofacial, thymic and parathyroid defects in DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) that affects 1/4000 live births. Eigthy to ninety percent of DGS-affected individuals are heterozygous a micro-deletion of chromosome 22q111, but the search for causal genes in the remaining 10-20% of patients with DGS remains ungoing. Moreover, the variable penetrance and severity of this syndrome suggests the contribution of additional modifier genes outside this chromosomal region. Finally, deletions of chromosome 22q11 only encounter for 15% of all cases of conotruncal defects, and the other gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these conotruncal defects in remain to be identified. The identification and characterization of these additional causal and modifier genes is an important goal for the future. Extensive investigation of the various aspects of vascular development in the VEGF isoform specific mice, using the retina as a model, revealed that vascular development was normal in VEGF(164/164) mice (that only express VEGF164), indicating that this isoform contains all necessary information for normal (arterial and venous) outgrowth, remodeling and patterning of blood vessels. In contrast, VEGF(120/120) mice exhibited pronounced vascular defects, with impaired venous and severely defective arterial vascular development in the retina. VEGF(188/188) mice had normal venous development, but aborted retinal arterial outgrowth. Dramatically reduced retinal vascular outgrowth in the mice that exclusively express the soluble VEGF120 isoform indicates that the longer isoforms are crucial for the establisment of a VEGF-gradient that guides the endothelial cells towards the periphery of the retina. Moreover, mice that lack the VEGF164 isoform exhibit impaired arterial outgrowth despite normal arterial and venous differentiation. This observation provides evidence for the recent theory that arterial and venous differentiation is predetermined in endothelial cells rather than established after initial outgrowth of undifferentiated vessels, and dedicates a novel role to VEGF164 in outgrowth of arterially differentiated endothelial cells. Predominant arterial expression of Nrp-1 implies that VEGF164 may mediate arterial outgrowth via Nrp-1. Half of the VEGF(120/120) neonates die within a few hours after birth because of conotruncal defects that are typically observed in DiGeorge syndrome. Further analysis revealed that these mice also exhibit aortic arch anomalies, a cleft palate, micrognathia, as well as absent and/or ectopic parathyroid glands and thymus. Thus, absence of the VEGF164 isoform in mice causes the entire spectrum of characteristic lifethreatening cardiovascular malformations and craniofacial, thymic and parathyroid defects of DGS, while mice expressing only the VEGF164-isoform appear normal. VEGF164 expression consistently colocalized with its receptor, Nrp-1 at DGS predilection sites, suggesting that both provide critical guidance or differentiation cues for vascular remodeling. In the VEGF164 deficient mice, no neural crest cell migration or differentation defects were detected. Moreover, the DGS phenotype was most prominent in mice with severe vascularization defects, possibly indicating that derailed signaling by vascular growth factors may be more important than originally anticipated, and suggesting a vascular etiology underlying DGS. This vascular hypothesis implies that DGS may be primarily a vascular phenotype, irrespective of the involvement of neural crest cells. Taken together, our observations indicate that, while the distinct VEGF isoforms are redundant for initial vessel assembly and growth, they differ greatly in providing critical spatial guidance cues for vascular remodeling and, perhaps also for differentiation of neural crest cell-derived tissues. These data implicate that the VEGF164-isoform may represent a candidate disease effector or modifier in the pathogenesis of congenital cardiovascular malformations in general, and of DGS in particular. Finally, I would like to conclude with the recent words of Dr. D. Srivastava: \"Discovery of the causes of complex genetic traits, such as congenital heart defects, has been difficult. However, the observation that secondary factors, be they genetic or environmental, may contribute to DiGeorge syndrome provides hope for the treatment and prevention of congenital heart defects. While prospects for gene therapy remain in the distant future, knowledge of the genetic pathways regulating cardiogenesis should lead to some of the secondary factors that may be modulated during the period of embryonic heart development. Given the rapid pace of discovery and the ever-increasing tools available to scientists and clinicians, the hope of translating genetic information regarding heart formation into tangible benefits for families with congenital heart defects has never been brighter\".", "journal": "Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van Belgie", "date": "2005-12-13", "authors": ["IStalmans"], "doi": null}

However, gene transfer to the pancreas is difficult because of its anatomic location and structure, and pancreatitis is a serious concern. Like the human pancreas, the canine pancreas is compact, with similar vascularization and lobular structure. It is therefore a suitable model in which to assess gene transfer strategies. Here we examined the ability of adenoviral vectors to transfer genes into the pancreas of dogs in which pancreatic circulation had been clamped. Adenoviruses carrying the beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene were injected into the pancreatic-duodenal vein and the clamp was released 10 min later. These dogs showed beta-gal-positive cells throughout the pancreas, with no evidence of pancreatic damage. beta-Gal was expressed mainly in acinar cells, but also in ducts and islets. Moreover, transduction was prominent in connective tissue of the lobe septa. beta-Gal expression in the exocrine pancreas of a diabetic dog was also found to be similar to that observed in healthy dogs. Thus, efficient gene transfer to canine pancreas in vivo may be achieved by adenovirus injection after clamping pancreatic circulation.

There is no consensus on the ideal method for shoulder reconstruction. We report the functional outcome in a homogeneous series of eight patients treated by arthrodesis using a vascularized free fibular flap.\nEight patients were included in this study. All had an aggressive tumor of the upper humerus. Tumor resection was associated with a rotator cuff and deltoid muscle resection in all patients. All patients then underwent shoulder arthrodesis using a free vascularized fibular flap fixed with a plate. Clinical and radiological evaluation was available for six patients at mean 28 months. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society function score was used to assess overall function of the upper limb. The cosmetic outcome and radiographic bone healing as well as hypertrophy of the fibular graft were noted.\nActive abduction and active flexion were 82 degrees on average. All patients could bring their hand to the mouth. Circumduction was possible but limited in amplitude. The mean function score was 26.5/30 with an excellent functional outcome in all patients. The cosmetic outcome was considered poor by all patients. Radiographically, bone healing was achieved at last follow-up in all patients but there was one case of failed fusion between the fibular graft and the scapula which required secondary iliac grafting. Mean fibular graft hypertrophy was 32.8% at last follow-up.\nTwo reconstruction methods have been described for patients who require tumor resection of the upper humerus: reconstruction with preservation of glenohumeral joint function and shoulder arthrodesis. Many techniques have been described for each method. It is however difficult to compare the different series reported in the literature because rotator cuff and deltoid muscle resection was not systematically performed and reconstruction methods varied between patients. An analysis of the literature shows that preservation of motion of the scapular glenoid joint can give good functional results when the rotator cuff and deltoid muscle can be preserved.

The distraction distances ranged from 16 to 22 mm. They were able to gain enough advancement in all three cases. A reoperation of a fronto-orbital advancement is more difficult than the primary operation because of possible infection, much loss of blood, low blood supply to advanced bones, a tendency of advanced bones to relapse, increased scalp skin tension, and the existence of bone defects. In these poor conditions, distraction osteogenesis has many advantages: good vascularization, no relapsing, a low infection rate, and no need for bony fixating points in the bone defects.

Clinically, four of five cases had shown features of limbal and scleral involvement.\nGranulomatous inflammation in the posterior corneal stroma, is not an uncommon finding in Acanthamoeba keratitis and could possibly be immune-mediated, contributing to persistence and progression of disease.\nPresence of granulomatous inflammation in Acanthamoeba keratitis, in most cases is associated with limbal and scleral involvement and therefore could be considered as one of the poor prognostic markers.

{"title": "Integrins and angiogenesis: a sticky business.", "abstract": "From an evolutionary point of view, the development of a cardiovascular system allowed vertebrates to nourish the several organs that compose their wider multicellular organism and to survive. Acquisition of new genes encoding for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and their cognate integrin receptors as well as secreted pro- and anti-angiogenic factors proved to be essential for the development of vascular networks in the vertebrate embryo. Postnatal tissue neo-vascularization plays a key role during wound healing and pathological angiogenesis as well. There is now clear evidence that building blood vessels in the embryo and in the adult organism relies upon different endothelial integrins and ECM ligands. A successful vascular development depends on fibronectin and its major receptor alpha5beta1 integrin, but not on alphavbeta3, alphavbeta5, and alpha6beta4 integrins that are instead central regulators of postnatal tumor angiogenesis. Here, endothelial alphavbeta3 elicits anti- or pro-angiogenic signals depending respectively on whether it is occupied by a soluble (e.g. type IV collagen derived tumstatin) or an insoluble (vitronectin) ECM ligand. The laminin-5 receptor alpha6beta4 integrin, expressed only by endothelial cells of mature blood vessels, controls the invasive phase of tumor angiogenesis in the adult organism. Finally, regulation of vascular morphogenesis relies upon the fine modulation of integrin activation by chemoattractant and chemorepulsive cues, such as angiogenic growth factors and semaphorins.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2005-12-06", "authors": ["GuidoSerini", "DonatellaValdembri", "FedericoBussolino"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.020"}
{"title": "Cell elongation is key to in silico replication of in vitro vasculogenesis and subsequent remodeling.", "abstract": "Vasculogenesis, the de novo growth of the primary vascular network from initially dispersed endothelial cells, is the first step in the development of the circulatory system in vertebrates. In the first stages of vasculogenesis, endothelial cells elongate and form a network-like structure, called the primary capillary plexus, which subsequently remodels, with the size of the vacancies between ribbons of endothelial cells coarsening over time. To isolate such intrinsic morphogenetic ability of endothelial cells from its regulation by long-range guidance cues and additional cell types, we use an in vitro model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in Matrigel. This quasi-two-dimensional endothelial cell culture model would most closely correspond to vasculogenesis in flat areas of the embryo like the yolk sac. Several studies have used continuum mathematical models to explore in vitro vasculogenesis: such models describe cell ensembles but ignore the endothelial cells' shapes and active surface fluctuations. While these models initially reproduce vascular-like morphologies, they eventually stabilize into a disconnected pattern of vascular \"islands.\" Also, they fail to reproduce temporally correct network coarsening. Using a cell-centered computational model, we show that the endothelial cells' elongated shape is key to correct spatiotemporal in silico replication of stable vascular network growth. We validate our simulation results against HUVEC cultures using time-resolved image analysis and find that our simulations quantitatively reproduce in vitro vasculogenesis and subsequent in vitro remodeling.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2005-12-06", "authors": ["Roeland M HMerks", "Sergey VBrodsky", "Michael SGoligorksy", "Stuart ANewman", "James AGlazier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.003"}

Transgenic mice containing the HIF-1alpha gene under the control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter were constructed. Myocardial infarction was produced by coronary ligation in HIF-1alpha transgenic mice and control animals.

The PH is associated with sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary artery remodeling. Furthermore, lung alveolarization and vascularization are reduced in the Denver FHR. We have recently shown that RhoA/Rho kinase signaling is involved in both vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling in animal models of hypoxic PH. In this study, we investigated the role of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling in the PH of Denver FHR. In alpha-toxin permeabilized pulmonary arteries from Denver FHR, the contractile sensitivity to Ca2+ was increased compared with those from sea-level FHR. RhoA activity and Rho kinase I protein expression in pulmonary arteries of Denver FHR (10-wk-old) were higher than in those of sea-level FHR. Acute inhalation of the Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil selectively reduced the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure in Denver FHR in vivo. Chronic fasudil treatment (30 mg.kg-1.day-1, from birth to 10 wk old) markedly reduced the development of PH and improved lung alveolarization and vascularization in Denver FHR.

Recent studies indicate that the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) may contribute to the vascularization of some tumors by disrupting the equilibrium between positive and negative angiogenic regulatory molecules. We determined whether IL-6 participates in the angiogenesis observed during the progression of ovarian carcinoma. We measured IL-6 production by human ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Not all cell lines secreted IL-6 in vitro; however, when the cell lines were implanted into the peritoneal cavity of female nude mice, every line secreted IL-6. Most human ovarian carcinoma cell lines tested secreted significant levels of the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Endothelial cell lines established from the ovary and mesentery of female H-2K(b)-tsA58 mice were tested for response to IL-6. Both endothelial cell lines expressed the IL-6R and their stimulation with the exogenous ligand significantly enhanced cell migration and activated the downstream signaling molecule signal transducers and activators of transcription 3. Dual immunohistochemical staining for IL-6R and CD31 revealed IL-6R expression on human endothelial cells within normal ovary and carcinoma specimens. Gelfoam sponges containing 0.4% agarose and IL-6 or basic fibroblast growth factor and implanted into the subcutis of BALB/c mice were vascularized to the same extent.

{"title": "Tumor inflammatory angiogenesis and its chemoprevention.", "abstract": "The importance of angiogenesis for the growth of tumors is widely recognized. Drugs that successfully target the endothelium, such as antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, are beginning to have an effect on the life expectancy of cancer patients. However, the endothelial cell is not the only possible target for antiangiogenic therapy or prevention of vascularization (angioprevention). It is evident from the literature that native immune cells recruited into tumors in turn stimulate the endothelium and are responsible for an indirect pathway of tumor vascularization. Inflammation-dependent angiogenesis seems to be a central force in tumor growth and expansion, a concept supported by the observation that the use of \"classic\" anti-inflammatory drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, leads to angiogenesis inhibition. The mechanisms of inflammatory angiogenesis provide new approaches to target, cure, or even better, prevent tumor angiogenesis by treatment with synthetic or natural agents with anti-inflammatory properties.

{"title": "Locally applied angiogenic factors--a new therapeutic tool for meniscal repair.", "abstract": "Tears in the peripheral part of the menisci have a better healing potential than tears in the central part, because the central two-thirds of the menisci are avascular. The avascular status of the meniscus is maintained by the expression of antiangiogenic factors such as endostatin. The distribution of endostatin in the menisci correlates with the degree of vascularization. Endostatin immunostaining is strong in the avascular zone and reduced in the vascularized outer one-third. Endostatin interacts with signal transduction of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by reducing VEGF-induced kinase (Erk1/2) phosphorylation. VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis in fetal menisci and it is down-regulated in the adult meniscus. We hypothesized that healing of meniscal tears in the avascular zone can be promoted by the local application of the angiogenic factor VEGF. To evaluate this hypothesis a tear was created in the avascular zone of the medial meniscus in 18 merino sheep. The tear was then repaired with an uncoated suture (group 1), a suture coated with PDLLA (group 2), and by a suture coated with PDLLA/VEGF (group 3). After 6 weeks we observed increased factor VIII immunostaining in the VEGF-treated group. However, in this treatment group (VEGF/PDLLA) no meniscus healed. In the uncoated suture group and in the PDLLA-coated suture group partial healing was observed in three animals and complete healing in three animals, respectively. Factor VIII expression is normally restricted to vascular endothelial cells. In this study, however, single endothelial cells could be detected in the menisci of the VEGF/PDLLA group. This finding suggests that the application of VEGF might have stimulated proliferation of vascular endothelial cells but the application of VEGF was not successful in stimulating the more complex process of vasculogenesis. Further immunohistochemical examinations of the specimen have shown that in the VEGF/PDLLA group there is strong immunostaining against matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13). In vitro studies have shown that VEGF can stimulate chondrocytes to proliferate but also to express MMP-13 via HIF1-alpha induction. Since meniscal fibrochondrocytes express the VEGF receptor 2 (KDR) the induction of MMP expression might be another factor which inhibits healing despite increased angiogenesis. In conclusion, the local application of VEGF via PDLLA-coated sutures does not promote meniscal healing. A single growth factor might not always be a promising tool for the promotion of tissue repair. Further studies have to find out if growth factor combinations (VEGF and angiopoitin) might be more effective in stimulating vasculogenesis during meniscal healing.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2005-12-03", "authors": ["WolfPetersen", "ThomasPufe", "ChristianSt\u00e4rke", "ThomasFuchs", "SebastianKopf", "MichaelRaschke", "RolandBecker", "BernhardTillmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2005.04.010"}

In the human being and sand rat, the cartilaginous endplate undergoes calcification with aging and is replaced by bone. Endplate sclerosis has long been thought to play a role in disc degeneration by decreasing nutrient availability to the disc, but this is still poorly understood.

Architectural features were scored on a semiquantitative scale for smoothness of the endplate face, irregularities on the endplate margin, and endplate thickness. There were 2 smaller sets of animals (n = 18) evaluated for endplate vascularity following in vivo injection of a fluorescent vascular tracer or by the use of immunocytochemistry to identify blood vessels.\nmicroCT revealed a solid bony surface to the endplate, which was not penetrated by vasculature; with aging/disc degeneration, there was roughening and pitting of the plate surface, and the development of irregular margins. In L5-6 and L6-7, sites of prominent disc degeneration evident on radiographs, the proportion of abnormalities in surface smoothness, margin irregularity, and endplate thickening were all statistically significant in both younger and older animals (P < or = 0.0027).

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in the promoting action of nicotine on gastric cancer growth. However, the action of nicotine and the relationship between COX-2 and VEGF/VEGFR system in tumorigenesis remain undefined. In this study, the effects of nicotine in tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis were studied with sponge implantation and Matrigel membrane models. Nicotine (200 microg/mL) stimulated gastric cancer cell proliferation, which was blocked by SC-236 (a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor) and CBO-P11 (a VEGFR inhibitor). This was associated with decreased VEGF levels as well as VEGFR-2 but not VEGFR-1 expression. Topical injection of nicotine enhanced tumor-associated vascularization, with a concomitant increase in VEGF levels in sponge implants. Again, application of SC-236 (2 mg/kg) and CBO-P11 (0.4 mg/kg) partially attenuated vascularization by approximately 30%. Furthermore, nicotine enhanced tumor cell invasion through the Matrigel membrane by 4-fold and promoted migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a cocultured system with gastric cancer cells.

The biopsies were cut into 40-microm-thick sections, labeled with antibodies against beta4-intergin (a lamina lucida marker), collagen IV, and the N-terminal end of collagen VII (lamina densa markers) and C-terminal end of collagen VII (a sublamina densa marker) and studied using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction of various regions of the BMZ showed a decreased number and size of the dermal papillae both in morphea and lichen sclerosus compared with normal skin. In morphea, the continuity of the BMZ at the level of lamina lucida, lamina densa, and sublamina densa was preserved whereas in LS numerous invaginations and holes were present in the BMZ at the level of the lamina lucida and lamina densa. Thus the alterations of the BMZ in morphea differ from those in lichen sclerosus. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the skin vascular network showed increased angiogenesis only in the early inflammatory stage of morphea, whereas in inactive morphea and lichen sclerosus various numbers of enlarged vessels were visible. The changes in the vascular network in morphea appear to be related to the activity of the disease.", "journal": "The American Journal of dermatopathology", "date": "2005-11-30", "authors": ["CezaryKowalewski", "AnnaKoz\u0142owska", "MartaG\u00f3rska", "KatarzynaWo\u017aniak", "MaciejKrajewski", "MariaB\u0142aszczyk", "StefaniaJab\u0142o\u0144ska"], "doi": "10.1097/01.dad.0000183679.40184.23"}

Dose-limiting toxicities reported at the maximum-tolerated doses > or = 75 mg/d were reversible grade 3 fatigue, grade 3 hypertension, and grade 2 bullous skin toxicity. Therefore, the recommended dose was 50 mg/d. At this dose, the main adverse effects were sore mouth, edema, and thrombocytopenia. Hair discoloration and yellow coloration of the skin were observed at doses > or = 50 mg/d. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that potentially active target plasma concentrations > or = 50 ng/mL can be achieved with moderate interpatient variability and a long half-life compatible with a single daily dosing. Six objective responses were observed in three renal cell carcinomas, one neuroendocrine tumor, one stromal tumor, and one unknown primary adenocarcinoma patient. At higher doses (> or = 75 mg/d), tumor responses were often associated with reduced intratumoral vascularization and central tumor necrosis, eventually resulting in organ perforation or fistula.\nAt the dose of 50 mg/d (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off), sunitinib displays manageable toxicity.

Furthermore, PLCdelta1/PLCdelta3 double-knockout embryos supplied with a normal placenta by the tetraploid aggregation method survived beyond E14.5, clearly indicating that the embryonic lethality is caused by a defect in trophoblasts.

These uni or bilateral lesions are potentially lethal mainly due to associated injuries and massive pelvic hemorrhage. The most frequently injured arteries are parietal branch of the commune, internal or external arteries because of their proximity to the bone, the sacro-iliac joint and the inferior ligaments of the pelvis. The pelvic bone dislocation and the increase of pelvic volume facilitate blood effusion. The aim of this study was to determine, on a cadaver fracture model, the direct anatomical consequences of \"open-book\" pelvic fracture on the ilio-lumbar pedicle and the pelvic cavity volume.\nBilateral open-book pelvic ring injuries were created in ten non-embalmed cadaver specimens by directly disrupting the pubic symphysis, the right and the left sacro-iliac joints. Pelvic volume was determined after total pelvic exenteration. Consequences of this fracture on vascular parietal network, nervous pelvic trunk and pelvic cavity volume were studied.\nThe mean volume of the pelvic cavity after complete visceral exenteration was 872.5 cm(3) (extremes 580-756 cm(3)). The average increase of pelvic volume was 20.8% after 5 cm of pubic diastasis. In all cases, because of a transversal disposition of the ilio-lumbar pedicle with regard to the sacro-iliac joint, reproduction of the open-book fracture caused a venous dilaceration of the ilio-lumbar vein in 12 cases after 5 cm of pubic diastasis (12/20=60%). No arterial dilaceration was observed on the ilio-lumbar artery, but this artery was put in tension.\nOpen-book fractures create an increase of pelvic volume that facilitates blood diffusion from parietal pelvic vascular network.

The study took placed in the Department of Medical Science Application and Research Center of Dicle University, Diyarbakir, Turkey, in 2002. Group 1 (control group) received no ovariectomy; all animals in the other groups were bilaterally ovariectomized and kept for 60 days.

We then cut the paraffin sections, which we obtained by routine histologic methods, into 5 mm and stained them with hematoxylin-eosin. We later evaluated the stained sections under a light microscope.\nThe body weight was higher in the ovariectomized rats compared to the control groups. Ovariectomy did not result in significant changes in the wet weight of the adrenal gland. Furthermore, body weight increased after estrogen therapy, and the wet weight of the adrenal gland increased in the estrogen group. It was obtained in the sham-operated group that ovariectomy resulted in a decrease in the activity of the adrenal cortex. In the sham-operated and estrogen group, we observed a prominent capsule, expanded zona glomerulosa cells, regular parallel columns in zona fasciculata and there was an increased vascularization in the medulla, after the estrogen treatment.\nWe determined that bilateral ovariectomy can result in a decrease in the activity of the adrenal cortex.

Cigarette smoke appears to have adverse effects along a continuum of reproductive processes. We therefore studied the effect of nicotine on follicular growth and vascularization of freely transplanted ovarian follicles.\nWe used the skinfold chamber model in Syrian golden hamsters, which allows the in vivo microscopy of follicular grafts. Animals were treated daily with nicotine at doses mimicking low-rate and high-rate smokers (0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously). Saline-treated animals served as controls. To further evaluate the effect of nicotine on angiogenesis, an in vitro aortic ring assay was used.\nThe re-vascularisation rate of follicles was similar in nicotine-treated animals and controls. During the 7 days after transplantation, nicotine further caused a dose-dependent inhibition of follicular growth. In contrast, the vascularized area and microvessel density were not affected by the nicotine exposure. In vitro aortic ring assays confirmed that nicotine does not influence sprouting and microvessel formation. However, immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 revealed a large extent of granulosa cell apoptosis within transplanted follicles of high-dose nicotine-treated animals.\nNicotine as one toxic component of cigarette smoke does not affect vascularization, but adversely influences follicular growth by an increase in apoptotic cell death. As follicular growth is a crucial step in normal ovulation and fertilization, nicotine-induced cell apoptosis may represent one of the mechanisms underlying the well-established link between smoking and fertility disorders.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2005-11-29", "authors": ["RBordel", "M WLaschke", "M DMenger", "BVollmar"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/dei393"}

High numbers of neutrophils accumulated around the Col-I fibers and degradation of Col-I fibers into small fragments was observed on day 14. Active MMP-8 co-localized with the neutrophils on day 14, indicating enzymatic degradation of Col-I by neutrophil collagenase. Highly vascularized extracellular matrix remained at day 70. No differences were observed in the FBR to Col-I after application on healthy or injured myocardium. The FBR had no adverse effects on the adjacent myocardial tissue.

In contrast, pathological angiogenesis, which is a conspicuous feature of tumor growth, ischemic diseases, and chronic inflammation, is characterized by vessels with aberrant angioarchitecture and compromised barrier function. Herein we review the subject of pathological angiogenesis, particularly that driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), from a new perspective. We propose that the serious structural and functional anomalies associated with VEGF-A-elicited neovessels, reflect, at least in part, imbalances in the internal molecular cues that govern the ordered assembly of ECs into three dimensional vascular networks and preserve vessel barrier function. Adopting such a viewpoint widens the focus from solely on specific pro-angiogenic stimuli such as VEGF-A to include a key set of cytoskeletal regulatory molecules, the Rho GTPases, which are known to direct multiple aspects of vascular morphogenesis including EC motility, alignment, multi-cellular organization, as well as intercellular junction integrity. We offer this perspective to draw attention to the importance of endothelial cytoskeletal dynamics for proper neovascularization and to suggest new therapeutic strategies with the potential to improve the pathological vascular phenotype.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2005-11-29", "authors": ["Janice ANagy", "Donald RSenger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.017"}

These strategies include trifunctional bispecific antibodies (trAb) as promising tools for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells and micrometastases. To date, these chimeric molecules have demonstrated their antitumor potential mainly in vitro. Here, trAb-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) displayed considerable antitumor activity, accompanied by the release of cytokines, which contributed to the antitumor activity but, on the other hand, may evoke serious limiting side-effects in vivo, demanding therapeutic interventions.\nThe antitumor activity and cytokine release by trAb-activated PBMCs were studied in co-cultures with multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS), which represent a three-dimensional in vitro model for solid tumors, especially non-vascularized micrometastases. The glucocorticoid prednisolone was tested for its influence on the release of TNF-alpha and the activity of PBMCs.\nIt was shown that PBMCs, which were stimulated with a trifunctional bispecific antibody, BiUII, displayed an excellent antitumor activity, resulting in complete disintegration of the MTS. Also, it was demonstrated that prednisolone significantly reduced the release of TNF-alpha, without impairing the antitumor activity of BiUII-activated PBMCs. In contrast, unspecific killing was reduced, as demonstrated with an identical trAb (Bi48), which recognizes an antigen absent from the target cells.\nThe in vivo application of bispecific antibodies for adjuvant tumor therapies may be limited by the manifest activation of immune effectors, accompanied by overwhelming cytokine release. Glucocorticoids, like prednisolone, may effectively reduce cytokine release without impairing the antitumor activity of trAb-activated immune cells.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2005-11-29", "authors": ["AnnetteWalz", "MichaelaAndratschke", "BarbaraWollenberg", "HorstLindhofer", "ReinhardZeidler"], "doi": null}

Bone regeneration was examined radiographically and histologically.\nIn the irradiation group, the radiographs showed little regeneration during the elongation phase. During the maturation phase, the callus appeared slowly, and its formation was spotty. Furthermore, regeneration was not completed until the fourth week of the maturation period. Histological examination at the end of distraction showed a gap in the distraction consisting of loose connective tissue, with part of the fibrous tissue oriented longitudinally. Four weeks after completion of distraction, the major part of the radiolucent region consisted of cartilage. The spotty osteogenesis was identified as enchondral ossification. Immunohistochemical examination of the regeneration area revealed that the blood vessels were extremely localized, and that the level of expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the osteoblasts was high. Microangiography showed that vascularization at the distracted sites was poor. Distraction osteogenesis was decreased markedly by preoperative irradiation in terms of both rate and process. The results suggested that most of the osteoprogenitor cells were damaged immediately after irradiation.

To elucidate the role of Gal alpha1,3Gal (alpha-Gal) epitopes in these processes in the absence of anti-Gal antibodies (Ab), this determinant was aberrantly expressed in HAEC. HAEC were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the porcine alpha1,3 galactosyltransferase to express alpha-Gal at high frequencies (75-95%). Alpha-Gal expression on HAEC did not increase their ability to support monocyte transendothelial migration or adhesion under either static or flow conditions. Porcine and human endothelium supported static adhesion and migration of monocytes equally well. However, human monocytes adhered less to PAEC than to HAEC (P = 0.03) under flow following human, but not porcine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha stimulation. In the absence of anti-Gal Ab, the alpha-Gal epitope does not contribute to increased monocyte adhesion to, or migration across, endothelium.

Retinal diseases are the most important causes of blindness (40-54%) in established economy nations while cataract (44-60%) and corneal diseases (8-25%) are the most common causes of blindness in countries with less developed economies. Keratitis during childhood, trauma, and keratitis during adulthood resulting in a vascularized corneal scar and adherent leucoma are the most frequent causes of corneal blindness in developing countries. Corneal diseases are responsible for 20% of childhood blindness. Nearly 80% of all corneal blindness is avoidable. The outcome of keratoplasty for vascularized corneal scar and adherent leucoma is unsatisfactory, necessitating repeat surgery in a high proportion of these cases. Other barriers for keratoplasty in these nations are suboptimal eye banking, lack of trained human resources, and infrastructure.\nSince the developing world carries most of the load of corneal blindness and the major causes of corneal blindness are corneal scar and active keratitis, development of corneal transplantation services need a comprehensive approach encompassing medical standards in eye banking, training of cornea specialists and eye banking personnel and exposure of ophthalmologists to care of corneal transplants for better follow-up care.

Cerebrovascular lesions frequently coexist with AD, creating an overlap in the clinical and pathological features of VaD and AD. This review assembles evidence for a role for cholinergic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of VaD, as has been established for AD. We first consider the anatomy and vascularization of the basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal system, emphasizing its susceptibility to the effects of arterial hypertension, sustained hypoperfusion, and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The impact of aging and consequences of disruption of the cholinergic system in cognition and in control of cerebral blood flow are further discussed. We also summarize preclinical and clinical evidence supporting cholinergic deficits and the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with VaD.

Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that integrin alphavbeta3 expression was restricted to tumor vasculature; the tumor cells were immunonegative. Only 2.5% of vessels detected with CD34 were immunopositive for integrin alphavbeta3. At present, no therapeutic implications can be drawn from our observations.

Four cases of congenital ulnar pseudarthrosis treated with free vascularized fibular graft are presented here. In two cases, the vascularized fibular graft included the proximal fibular epiphysis to reconstruct the DRUJ and ulnocarpal joints. Average age of the four patients at time of vascularized fibular grafting was 10 years (range 3-16 years). Patients had undergone up to three previous failed operations. A step-cut osteotomy technique with rigid internal fixation was used in all patients. Donor-site distal tibiofibular arthrodesis was performed in skeletally immature patients when appropriate. At average follow-up of 60 months (range 33-83 months), all patients achieved bony union with full wrist range of motion compared with the contralateral extremity. The DRUJ was stable in all patients. Two skeletally immature patients with concomitant epiphyseal transfer showed continued skeletal growth. Two patients nearing skeletal maturity achieved revascularization of the distal ulna. Free vascularized fibular grafting is a successful option in the treatment of congenital ulnar pseudarthrosis.

Its speed and automation (2 s per entire image versus 20 s per segment for manual methods) enables detailed level-by-level measurements over wider areas. An automated tracing algorithm is used to estimate vessel centerlines, thickness, directions, and locations of landmarks such as bifurcations and crossover points. The hierarchical structure of the vascular network is recovered from the trace fragments and landmarks by a novel algorithm. Optical densities (OD) are measured from vascular segments using the minimum reflected intensities inside and outside the vessel. The OD ratio (ODR=OD600/OD570) bears an inverse relationship to systemic HbO2 saturation (SO2). The sensitivity for detecting saturation change when breathing air versus pure oxygen was calculated from the measurements made on six subjects and was found to be 0.0226 ODR units, which is in good agreement with previous manual measurements by the dual-wavelength technique, indicating the validity of the automation.

{"title": "Rationale for reconstruction of large scalp defects using the anterolateral thigh flap: structural and aesthetic outcomes.", "abstract": "The advent of free tissue transfer has provided multiple options that allow preservation and maintain both the structural and aesthetic status of the scalp. Since the first report of the anterolateral thigh flap in 1984, it has become one of the most commonly used flaps for the reconstruction of various soft-tissue defects. Eleven free anterolateral thigh flaps were used to reconstruct soft-tissue defects of different regions of the scalp. Two of these flaps were used for the occipital region, six for temporal regions, two for the frontoparietal midline region, and the remaining flap for a defect of the forehead. The study consisted of 10 males and one female whose ages ranged from 18 to 82 years (mean age: 52.5 years). Six patients had primary or recurrent cancer, four had acute or subacute wounds resulting from trauma or craniotomy, and one had high-tension electrical burn injury. The size of the flaps ranged from 14 to 27 cm in length and from 6 to 18 cm in width. The overall flap success rate was 100%. In two cases, primary thinning of the flap was performed to reconstruct a tissue defect of the temporal region in one patient and a forehead defect in the other. In two patients, the fascial layer of the flap was used as a source for a vascularized fascial flap to cover defects of the dura mater. No secondary corrections, including debulking procedures or scar revision, were necessary. No infections or hematomas were observed. Six cases underwent split-thickness skin grafting of the donor site and, in the remaining cases, the donor sites were closed directly. No donor-site morbidity was observed.

Angiogenic activity of wound fluid from latissimus flaps was determined by thymidine incorporation in porcine microendothelial cells exposed to various concentrations of wound fluid and control media. Angiogenic and matrix growth factors were altered in a linear fashion during the wound-healing process. Regression analysis provided evidence for decreasing levels of PDGF and EGF for latissimus flaps. Also, statistically significant differences of growth factor levels were found for paired comparison of flap types at different times after operation. Growth of in-vitro endothelial cells was stimulated most by 10 percent wound fluid, compared to any of the individual recombinant angiogenic factors or combinations of these factors. The data suggest that vascularized tissue flaps will promote wound healing by providing sufficient sources of growth factors in the wound environment.

VEGF gene therapy improves perfusion of ischemic myocardium in experimental models and possibly in patients with end-stage coronary artery disease. In addition to its proliferative and migratory effect on endothelial cells, it also activates and up-regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Therefore, the authors investigated coronary endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in patients before and after VEGF gene therapy. The effect of intracoronary acetylcholine infusion on coronary diameter was assessed at baseline and after 3 months follow-up in patients with end-stage coronary artery disease treated with VEGF gene and in controls scheduled for elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) (acetylcholine test at diagnostic angiography and before a subsequently scheduled PTCA). Five out of six VEGF patients experienced a reduction in anginal complaints. Angiographic evidence for improved collateral filling was evident in two out of six patients. The vasoconstrictive response to acetylcholine was partly converted into dilatation. In contrast, the acetylcholine response in control patients remained vasoconstrictive.

{"title": "Changes in response to spinal cord injury with development: vascularization, hemorrhage and apoptosis.", "abstract": "Chick embryos are capable of functional spinal cord regeneration following crush injury until embryonic day 13. Developmental changes occurring thereafter result in failure to regenerate. Secondary injury mechanisms can result in apoptotic cell death and make a major contribution to cell loss after trauma. We report here that around embryonic day 13 there is a dramatic increase in blood vessel numbers in the spinal cord, and that the extent of hemorrhage in response to injury increases with developmental age. This is paralleled by increased apoptosis and subsequent cavitation in spinal cords injured at embryonic day 15 as compared with embryonic day 11. Following spinal cord injury at embryonic day 15, apoptotic cell death is extensive and spreads to the same extent as the hemorrhage. When hemorrhage is reduced by treatment with the hemostatic drug desmopressin the extent of apoptosis and cavity formation in spinal cords injured at embryonic day 15 decreases. Furthermore, manipulations of embryonic day 11 spinal cords that increase hemorrhage also increase apoptosis and result in cavitation in contrast to the effective repair typical of this stage.

There were no differences in LH pulse characteristics, area of VWF staining, proliferation index, steroidogenic cell characteristics, basal or LH-stimulated progesterone production by luteal cells between cows with an early or late progesterone rise (P > 0.10). However, the area of VWF staining increased from days 5 to 8, while the proliferation index decreased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the luteal cells were more responsive to LH on day 8 (P < 0.01).

{"title": "Perlecan knockdown in metastatic prostate cancer cells reduces heparin-binding growth factor responses in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.", "abstract": "Perlecan (Pln) is a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) of extracellular matrices and bone marrow stroma. Pln, via glycosaminoglycans in domains I and V, acts as a co-receptor for delivery of heparin binding growth factors (HBGFs) that support cancer growth and vascularization. Specifically, glycosaminoglycans bind HBGFs and activate HBGF receptors, including those for FGF-2 and VEGF-A. The contribution of Pln to prostate cancer growth was tested using a ribozyme approach to knockdown Pln expression levels. Transfection into the androgen-independent, bone targeted prostate cancer line, C4-2B, and efficient stable knockdown of Pln was demonstrated by quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Three individually isolated subclones with 75-80% knockdown in Pln mRNA, protein expression and secretion into ECM were used to study in vitro growth responses to FGF-2 and VEGF-A. While cells with normal Pln levels responded to both HBGFs, knockdown cells responded poorly. All lines responded to serum growth factors and IGF-I. Anchorage-independent growth assays showed reduced colony size and cohesiveness by all Pln deficient subclones compared to parental C4-2B cells. In vivo effects of Pln knockdown were measured by inoculating knockdown and control ribozyme transfected cell lines into athymic mice. A reduced growth rate, smaller tumor size, diminished vascularization and failure to elevate serum PSA characterized mice bearing Pln knockdown C4-2B cells. Poor vascularization correlated with reduced levels of VEGF-A secreted by Pln knockdown lines. We conclude that Pln is an essential ECM component involved in growth responses of metastatic prostate cancer cells to HBGFs deposited in local and metastatic microenvironment.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2005-11-12", "authors": ["CristianaSavor\u00e8", "ChuZhang", "CarolineMuir", "RitingLiu", "JeffreyWyrwa", "JunShu", "Haiyen EZhau", "Leland W KChung", "Daniel DCarson", "Mary CFarach-Carson"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-005-2339-3"}

We induced retinopathy in tumor necrosis factor receptor-deficient mice (TNFR-) in order to examine the role TNF-alpha plays in the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity.\nOn postnatal day (P) 7, TNFR-knockout mice and their congenic controls, B6129JF1 (B6129) mice, were exposed to 75% oxygen for up to 5 days and then allowed to recover in room air. Retinopathy was qualitatively assessed by examining fluorescein (FITC) angiography. Furthermore, retinal vascular changes were quantified by immunolabeling retinal vessels in cross sections with an anti-type IV collagen antibody. Disease pathology was quantified by counting preretinal neovascular nuclei. TUNEL analysis was performed to determine if TNFR-mice exhibited a reduced number of apoptotic cells after oxygen-induced retinopathy.\nFITC-perfused retinas qualitatively demonstrated similar degrees of vascular development and vaso-obliteration on P12 in the room air and hyperoxia-exposed TNFR- and B6129 mice. On P17, the hyperoxia-exposed TNFR- and B6129 mice qualitatively appeared to develop a similar degree of retinal neovascularization. However, FITC-perfused retinal flat mounts on P21 suggested that the hyperoxia-exposed TNFR-mice had a prolonged neovascular response compared to the hyperoxia-exposed B6129 mice. Type IV collagen staining revealed delayed development of the deep intraretinal vessels in the TNFR-room control mice and hyperoxia-exposed TNFR-mice, as compared with B6129 controls. On P17, the average number of preretinal nuclei was similar between the hyperoxia-exposed TNFR-mice and B6129 mice. However, on P21, the neovascularization in the B6129 mice had regressed (3.9 +/- 0.57, preretinal nuclei), whereas neovascularization in the TNFR-mice remained prominent (25.6 +/- 6.3, preretinal nuclei). On P21, the B6129 mice exhibited increased apoptosis in preretinal vascular tufts as compared with TNFR- mice.\nTNFR- mice had both an altered development of the intraretinal vessels and altered angiogenic response after hyperoxia.

Despite significant advances in surgical technique and anesthetic management, significant morbidity and mortality remain associated with their repair. In compliance with principles of reducing postoperative morbidity, we developed a thoraco-abdominal endovascular graft in experimental models of type III and type IV thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm. This device had to preserve the vascularization of the visceral arteries while ensuring full aneurysmal exclusion.\nSix implantations of the endovascular graft were performed. This graft was a modular system, made of: 1) a custom made main body containing 4 prosthetic visceral branches, 2) 4 self-expandable stent-grafts connecting prosthetic visceral branches with visceral arteries, 3) a custom made tubular endovascular graft connecting the main body with one of the iliac arteries.\nOn angiographic controls, full aneurysmal exclusion was achieved while maintaining visceral artery perfusion.

To this purpose, in vitro integrin-binding assays were used to screen a library of conformationally constrained bicyclic lactam Arg-Gly-Asp-containing pseudopeptides. The results identified ST1646 as a high-affinity specific ligand for alpha(v)beta3 and alpha(v)beta5 integrins with negligible interacting with alpha5beta1 integrin. In all the assays, ST1646 was equipotent to or more potent than the well-characterized integrin antagonists c(RGDfV) and cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-[NMe]Val) (EMD121974). In the chorioallantoic membrane assay, topical administration of ST1646 was able to prevent the angiogenic responses elicited by recombinant fibroblast growth factor-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, systemic administration of ST1646 in mice exerted a significant antiangiogenic activity on neovascularization triggered by mammary carcinoma MDA-MB435 cells implanted s.c. in a dorsal air sac via a (Millipore Filter Corporation, Bedford, MA) chamber. Moreover, ST1646 delivery via an osmotic pump inhibited the growth and vascularization of tumor xenografts originating from the injection of alpha(v)beta3/alpha(v)beta5-expressing human ovarian carcinoma cells in nude mice. In agreement with the biochemical and pharmacologic studies, Monte Carlo/Stochastic Dynamics simulation showed that the bicyclic scaffold in ST1646 forced the compound to assume a preferred conformation superimposable to the X-ray conformation of alpha(v)beta3-bound EMD121974. Accordingly, computer-docking studies indicated that the ST1646-alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex maintains the ligand-receptor distances and interactions observed in the crystalline EMD121974-alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex.

{"title": "HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis and angiogenesis are reduced in cyclooxygenase-2 knockout mice.", "abstract": "The inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is overexpressed in approximately 40% of human breast cancers and at higher frequencies in preinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Cox-2 expression is particularly associated with overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu). To definitively interrogate the role of Cox-2 in mammary neoplasia, we have used a genetic approach, crossing Cox-2-deficient mice with a HER2/neu transgenic strain, MMTV/NDL. At 20 weeks of age, mammary glands from virgin MMTV/NDL females contained multiple focal tumors, or mammary intraepithelial neoplasias, which histologically resembled human DCIS. Mammary tumor multiplicity and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels were significantly decreased in Cox-2 heterozygous and knockout animals relative to Cox-2 wild-type controls. Notably, the proportion of larger tumors was decreased in Cox-2-deficient mice. HER2/neu-induced mammary hyperplasia was also substantially reduced in Cox-2 null mice. Additionally, mammary glands from Cox-2 knockout mice exhibited a striking reduction in vascularization, and expression of proangiogenic genes was correspondingly reduced. Decreased vascularization was observed both in dysplastic and normal-appearing regions of Cox-2-null mammary glands. Our data provide the first genetic evidence that Cox-2 contributes to HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis.

In this study we describe an in vivo model which allows neovascularization of engineered cardiac tissue. Three-dimensional cardiac tissue, termed \"cardioids,\" was engineered in vitro from the spontaneous delamination of a confluent monolayer of cardiac cells. Cardioids were sutured onto a support framework and then implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in syngeneic recipient rats. Three weeks after implantation, cardioids were recovered for in vitro force testing and histological evaluation. Staining for hematoxylin and eosin demonstrated the presence of viable cells within explanted cardioids. Immunostaining with von Willebrand factor showed the presence of vascularization. Electron micrographs revealed the presence of large amounts of aligned contractile proteins and a high degree of intercellular connectivity. The peak active force increased from an average value of 57 microN for control cardioids to 447 microN for explanted cardioids. There was also a significant increase in the specific force. There was a significant decrease in the time to peak tension and half relaxation time. Explanted cardioids could be electrically paced at frequencies of 1-5 Hz. Explanted cardioids exhibited a sigmoidal response to calcium and positive chronotropy in response to epinephrine. As the field of cardiac tissue engineering progresses, it becomes desirable to engineer larger diameter tissue equivalents and to induce angiogenesis within tissue constructs.

We report here expression of the Wilms' tumor gene-1, Wt1, in coronary vessels, which could contribute to the defective cardiac vascularization in Wt1-/- mice. Furthermore, the high-affinity neurotrophin receptor TrkB, which is expressed in the epicardium and subepicardial blood vessels, was nearly absent from Wt1-deficient hearts. Activation of Wt1 in an inducible cell line significantly enhanced TrkB expression. The promoter of NTRK2, the gene encoding TrkB, was stimulated approximately 10-fold by transient cotransfection of a Wt1 expression construct. The critical DNA-binding site for activation of the NTRK2 promoter by Wt1 was delineated by DNase I footprint analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Transgenic experiments revealed that the identified Wt1 consensus motif in the NTRK2 promoter was necessary to direct expression of a reporter gene to the epicardium and the developing vasculature of embryonic mouse hearts. Finally, mice with a disrupted Ntrk2 gene lacked a significant proportion of their intramyocardial blood vessels.

{"title": "Enhancement of tendon-bone healing of anterior cruciate ligament grafts by blockage of matrix metalloproteinases.", "abstract": "The use of soft-tissue grafts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction delays the healing process. This delay may be due to biochemical and/or biomechanical insults. We hypothesized that the blocking effect of alpha2-macroglobulin on synovial matrix metalloproteinase activity may enhance the healing of tendon graft in a bone tunnel.\nThe study was performed on twenty-eight healthy, skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits. Each rabbit underwent bilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of the ipsilateral semitendinosus tendon. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha2-macroglobulin) was injected into the knee joint in one limb, and the contralateral limb served as a control. The rabbits were killed two weeks (fourteen rabbits) or five weeks (fourteen rabbits) after the operative procedures. The presence of matrix metalloproteinases in synovial fluid, and the blocking effect of alpha2-macroglobulin on them, were determined with enzymatic assays. Healing between the tendon and the bone tunnel was assessed morphologically by determining the presence of fibrovascular tissue and collagen fibers. Healing also was assessed quantitatively by measuring the ultimate load to failure of the reconstructed complex.\nThere was an increase in matrix metalloproteinases in the control group; in contrast, there was a decrease in the study group (p < 0.05). In the control specimens, the fibrovascular tissue at the bone-tendon interface had developed into dense connective tissue with poor vascularization. In the treated specimens, the bone tunnel had more areas of denser connective-tissue ingrowth. The interface tissue was more mature and contained numerous perpendicular collagen bundles (Sharpey fibers). The ultimate load to failure was significantly greater in the alpha2-macroglobulin-treated specimens than in the untreated controls at both two and five weeks.\nThe present study demonstrated that alpha2-macroglobulin blockade of matrix metalloproteinases can enhance bone-tendon healing.

Previously, we developed an in vitro model of this process, wherein human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) differentiate to chondrocytes when cultured in a three-dimensional porous collagen sponge containing DBP. In other studies, medium perfusion was beneficial in maintaining phenotype and viability of many cell types in plain porous collagen sponges, including fibroblasts, bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts, and epidermal cells. In contrast, medium perfusion inhibited chondrogenesis by articular chondrocytes; reduction of oxygen tension to 5%, however, restored chondrogenesis. These observations are consistent with the fact that in vivo cartilage is avascular and relatively hypoxic compared with other vascularized tissues. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that low oxygen tension (hypoxia, 5% oxygen) would enhance induced chondrogenesis in hDFs cultured with DBP. As expected, hypoxia upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha in hDFs in all conditions (i.e. +/- perfusion, +/- DBP). Hypoxia increased accumulation of cartilage-specific matrix chondroitin 4-sulfate in hDFs, but only in the presence of DBP (165%, compared to normoxia, p < 0.05). Hypoxia did not appear to have detrimental effects on cell viability and proliferation. In sum, hypoxia enhanced cartilage matrix accumulation by hDFs cultured with DBP.

Six patients (3 males; 3 females) met these criteria and received FAMM flap repair. Outcomes were assessed based on comparison of preoperative versus last follow-up (range, 10-30 months; mean 17 months) assessment of perforation size and symptomatology. Overall discomfort was rated at each time point on a 1-10 scale.\nAge at time of operation ranged from 21 to 44 years, with a mean of 34 years of age. Causes of septal perforation included blunt trauma (50%), cocaine abuse (33%), and submucous resection (17%). Preoperatively, maximal recorded dimensions of septal perforations ranged from 3.1 to 4.0 cm with a mean of 3.5 +/- 0.4 cm. Symptoms included pain (83%), dryness (67%), crusting (50%), discharge (33%), epistaxis (33%), and obstruction (33%). Three or more symptoms were experienced by 5 patients (83%). Overall discomfort ranged from 6-10, with a mean of 8.4. Postoperatively at last follow-up, all 6 patients (100%) achieved closure of their septal defect (P < 0.001). Overall discomfort score was zero for all 6 patients (100%) (P < 0.0001). Complete symptomatic resolution was also noted among all 6 patients (100%) (P < 0.01).\nIn summary, the advantages of the FAMM flap closure technique were (1) no visible external scar, with minimal donor site morbidity; (2) successful closure of large septal defects (>2 cm) with vascularized tissue in a single stage; and (3) resolution of patient symptomatology.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2005-11-01", "authors": ["Justin BHeller", "Joubin SGabbay", "AndrewTrussler", "Misha MHeller", "James PBradley"], "doi": "10.1097/01.sap.0000184012.63970.c3"}

Although the arterial supply to the PG is generally known, contributions from different arterial branches such as the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), and middle cerebral artery (MCA) have not been comprehensively studied. The aim of the present study was to provide detailed information about the arteries of the PG.\nTwenty adult human brains (40 hemispheres) were obtained, and ACA, MCA, and PCA were separately cannulated and injected with latex. The PG was identified.\nThe ACA supplied the medial one third and the MCA supplied the lateral two thirds of the PG. The PCA did not reach the PG in any of the hemispheres. In 16 hemispheres (40%), the callosomarginal artery and, in 13 hemispheres (32.5%), the pericallosal artery were dominant for the medial one third of the PG. In 11 hemispheres (27.5%), equal dominance was observed. MCA branches at the lateral tip of the PG were classified into precentral, central, and postcentral groups. In 29 hemispheres (72.5%), the central group, and in 4 hemispheres (10%), the precentral group were dominant for the lateral two thirds of the PG. In 7 hemispheres (17.5%), the precentral and central groups were equally dominant.

Bioengineered cardiac grafts are created by combining autologous cell transplantation with a degradable scaffold as a temporary extracellular matrix. Here we present a system for engineered myocardium combining cultured cardiomyocytes and a novel biodegradable scaffold with a unique extracellular matrix-like topography.\nCardiomyocytes were harvested from neonatal rats and cultured in vitro on biodegradable electrospun nanofibrous poly(epsilon-caprolactone) meshes. Between days 5 and 7, the meshes were overlaid to construct 3-dimensional cardiac grafts. On day 14 of in vitro culture, the engineered cardiac grafts were analyzed by means of histology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy.\nThe cultured cardiomyocytes attached well to the meshes, and strong beating was observed throughout the experimental period. The average fiber diameter of the scaffold is about 250 nm, well below the size of an individual cardiomyocyte. Hence the number of cell-cell contacts is maximized. Constructs with up to 5 layers could be formed without any incidence of core ischemia. The individual layers adhered intimately. Morphologic and electrical communication between the layers was established, as verified by means of histology and immunohistochemistry. Synchronized beating was also observed.\nThis report demonstrates the formation of thick cardiac grafts in vitro and the versatility of biodegradable electrospun meshes for cardiac tissue engineering.

We investigated the lipid content and fatty acid composition of the human placental phospholipids at 2 gestational periods, early in pregnancy (8-14 wk, n = 48) and at term (38-41 wk of gestation, n = 19). The subjects were healthy, normotensive, and free of medical and obstetric complications. The lipid concentration of placentae increased from 0.8% in early gestation to 1.4% at term (P < 0.0001). The mean proportions of AA were lower in the choline (P < 0.05), inositol (P < 0.0001), and ethanolamine (P < 0.0001) phosphoglycerides of the term compared with the early placenta. In contrast, the proportions of the immediate precursor of AA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), were higher in the term placenta, particularly in the inositol and serine phosphoglycerides (P < 0.0001). In sphingomyelin, the percentage of lignoceric acid was increased and that of nervonic acid was reduced at term (P < 0.01). The dominance of AA, particularly in the early placenta, suggests that it has an important role for placental development, i.e., organogenesis and vascularization. There was no evidence of an accumulation of AA in the placenta toward term, which might be a trigger for parturition. In contrast, the increased proportion of DGLA (precursor of the vasorelaxant and anticoagulant prostaglandin E(1)) at term is more consistent with a profile favoring optimal blood flow to nourish the fetal growth spurt.", "journal": "The Journal of nutrition", "date": "2005-10-28", "authors": ["DemetrisBitsanis", "Michael ACrawford", "TherishneeMoodley", "HolmHolmsen", "KebreabGhebremeskel", "OvrangDjahanbakhch"], "doi": "10.1093/jn/135.11.2566"}
{"title": "Vascular development of the brain requires beta8 integrin expression in the neuroepithelium.", "abstract": "We showed previously that loss of the integrin beta8 subunit, which forms alphavbeta8 heterodimers, results in abnormal vascular development in the yolk sac, placenta, and brain. Animals lacking the integrin beta8 (itgbeta8) gene die either at midgestation, because of insufficient vascularization of the placenta and yolk sac, or shortly after birth with severe intracerebral hemorrhage. To specifically focus on the role of integrins containing the beta8 subunit in the brain, and to avoid early lethalities, we used a targeted deletion strategy to delete itgbeta8 only from cell types within the brain. Ablating itgbeta8 from vascular endothelial cells or from migrating neurons did not result in cerebral hemorrhage. Targeted deletion of itgbeta8 from the neuroepithelium, however, resulted in bilateral hemorrhage at postnatal day 0, although the phenotype was less severe than in itgbeta8-null animals. Newborn mice lacking itgbeta8 from the neuroepithelium had hemorrhages in the cortex, ganglionic eminence, and thalamus, as well as abnormal vascular morphogenesis, and disorganized glia. Interestingly, adult mice lacking itgbeta8 from cells derived from the neuroepithelium did not show signs of hemorrhage.

To examine the short-term effects of DC101, we surface transplanted the squamous cell carcinoma cell line A5-RT3 onto nude mice. After short-term treatment with DC101, we observed rapid reduction in vascularization and reversion of the tumor phenotype. Beginning 24 hours after treatment, VEGFR-2 inhibition resulted in decreased vessel density within the tenascin-c-staining tumor-associated stroma and reduced endothelial cell proliferation. Stromal expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -13 was drastically reduced 96 hours after VEGFR-2 inhibition as detected by in situ hybridization and in situ zymography. Moreover, the morphology of the tumor-stroma border changed from a highly invasive carcinoma to a well-demarcated, premalignant phenotype. The latter was characterized by the appearance of a regular basement membrane in immunostaining and ultrastructural analyses. These findings suggest that VEGFR-2 inhibition by DC101 evokes very rapid reduction of preformed vessels and decreases both stromal protease expression and gelatinolytic activity, resulting in the modulation of the tumor-stroma border zone and reversion of the tumor phenotype. Thus, short-term inhibition of VEGF signaling results in complex stromal alterations with crucial consequences for the tumor phenotype.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2005-10-28", "authors": ["Daniel WMiller", "SilviaVosseler", "NicolaeMirancea", "Daniel JHicklin", "PeterBohlen", "Hans EV\u00f6lcker", "Frank GHolz", "Norbert EFusenig"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61226-6"}

{"title": "Microcirculation and venous ulcers: a review.", "abstract": "Recent histological and immunocytochemical analyses of venous leg ulcers suggest that lesions observed in the different stages of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may be related to an inflammatory process. This inflammatory process leads to fibrosclerotic remodeling of the skin and then to ulceration. The vascular network of the most superficial layers of the skin appears to be the target of the inflammatory reaction. Hemodynamic forces such as venous hypertension, circulatory stasis, and modified conditions of shear stress appear to play an important role in an inflammatory reaction accompanied by leukocyte activation which clinically leads to CVI: venous dermatitis and venous ulceration. The leukocyte activation is accompanied by the expression of integrins and by synthesis and release of many inflammatory molecules, including proteolytic enzymes, leukotrienes, prostaglandin, bradykinin, free oxygen radicals, cytokines, and possibly other classes of inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory reaction perpetuates itself, leading to liposclerotic skin and subcutaneous tissue remodeling. In light of the mechanisms of venous ulcer formation cited above, therapy in the future might be directed against leukocyte activation in order to diminish the magnitude of the inflammatory response. With this in mind, the attention of many investigators has been drawn to two different drugs with an anti-inflammatory effect: pentoxifylline and flavonoids.", "journal": "Annals of vascular surgery", "date": "2005-10-26", "authors": ["LuigiPascarella", "Geert W SchmidSch\u00f6nbein", "John JBergan"], "doi": "10.1007/s10016-005-7661-3"}

Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess reliability. RESULTS.: EV measurements were highly reproducible (ICC > or = 0.97) without significant differences between planes and rotation steps. Endometrial and subendometrial VI, FI, and VFI presented ICCs above 0.90 with the exception of the subendometrial FI (ICC > or = 0.80). There were no significant differences according to measurement plane and rotation step except for subendometrial VFI. Nevertheless, 3D power Doppler indices calculated in the coronal plane and 9 degrees rotation step obtained the highest ICC. ICCs for 3D-PDA indices from the tumoral endometria were significantly higher than those calculated from the stimulated endometria.\nEndometrial volume and endometrial and subendometrial 3D power Doppler indices have an acceptable reproducibility, significantly higher in tumoral endometria. The reliability of measurements does not seem to be significantly influenced by the rotation plane and degrees of rotation. These results support that 3D-PDA and VOCAL are reliable methods to evaluate the physiological and pathological changes of the endometrium.", "journal": "Gynecologic oncology", "date": "2005-10-26", "authors": ["Luis TMerc\u00e9", "Juan LAlc\u00e1zar", "VirginiaEngels", "JuanTroyano", "SantiagoBau", "Jos\u00e9 MBajo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ygyno.2005.09.024"}

Forty-five patients were treated for active hyperthyroidism, 161 were euthyroid (85 immediately before withdrawal of antithyroid drug at maintenance doses, 76 in stable remission after withdrawal of antithyroid treatment). Free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyrotropin, and disease-specific autoantibodies (antithyrotropin-releasing hormone antibody) were determined in all patients.\nThe ultrasound images were classified on the basis of homogeneous, finely unhomogeneous, or micronodular appearance. The proportion of unhomogeneous plus micronodular patterns was greater in hyperthyroid (77.8%) than in euthyroid patients (62.1%). In the latter group, the pattern distribution was significantly different in patients who were antibody positive relative to patients who were antibody negative (p < 0.01). In the stable remission subgroup, the pattern distribution differed according to thyrotropin levels (p < .01). There was a correlation between echopattern and color Doppler sonography as vascularization variables progressively increased in the transition from homogeneous to unhomogeneous and micronodular echopattern (most evident echotexture changes).\nA sonographic-based classification in Graves' disease can distinguish subgroups of patients with different clinical courses and disease activity.

However, limited donor sites and technical difficulty limit its application. Vascular bundle transplantation may provide an alternative. However, even if vascular ingrowth is presumed to occur in such situations, its extent in aiding revascularization for ultimate graft incorporation is not well understood. A rabbit tibia model was used to study and compare vascularized, segmental, diaphyseal, nonvascularized conventional, and vascular bundle-implanted grafts with a combination of angiographic, radiographic, histopathologic, and bone scanning techniques. Complete graft incorporation in conventional grafts was observed at 6 months, whereas it was 8 to 12 weeks with either of the vascularized grafts. The pattern of radionuclide uptake and the duration of graft incorporation between vascular segmental bone grafts (with intact endosteal blood supply) and vascular bundle-implanted segmental grafts were similar. A vascular bundle implanted in the recipient bone was found to anastomose extensively with the intraosseous circulation at 6 weeks. Effective revascularization of bone could be seen when a simple vascular bundle was introduced into a segment of bone deprived of its normal blood supply.

{"title": "Tissue engineering of bone: search for a better scaffold.", "abstract": "Large bone defects still represent a major problem in orthopedics. Traditional bone-repair treatments can be divided into two groups: the bone transport (Ilizarov technology) and the graft transplant (autologous or allogeneic bone grafts). Thus far, none of these strategies have proven to be always resolving. As an alternative, a tissue engineering approach has been proposed where osteogenic cells, bioceramic scaffolds, growth factors and physical forces concur to the bone defect repair. Different sources of osteoprogenitor cells have been suggested, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) being in most cases the first choice.\nIn association with mineral tridimensional scaffolds, BMSC form a primary bone tissue which is highly vascularized and colonized by host hemopoietic marrow. The chemical composition of the scaffold is crucial for the osteoconductive properties and the resorbability of the material. In addition, scaffolds should have an internal structure permissive for vascular invasion. Porous bioceramics [hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium phosphate] are osteoconductive and are particularly advantageous for bone tissue engineering application as they induce neither an immune nor an inflammatory response in the implanted host. Earlier, we first reported a cell-based tissue engineering procedure to treat three patients with long bone segmental defects. Cells were loaded on a 100% HA porous ceramic. These scaffolds proved to have good osteoconductive properties resulting in a good functional recovery, but they have not been resorbed after more than 5 years from the implant. In addition, due to the high density of the mineral and the relatively low porosity (50-60%), it was very difficult to monitor the patient recovery during the post-surgery time using X-rays.\nWe report here some pre-clinical testing of new scaffolds.

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor gene-activated matrix (VEGF165-GAM) enhances osteogenesis and angiogenesis in large segmental bone defects.", "abstract": "Healing of fractures is dependent on vascularization of bone, which is in turn promoted by VEGF. It was shown that 0.1 and 1 mg of pVEGF165-GAM led to a significant increase in vascularization and bone regeneration in defects that would otherwise have led to atrophic nonunions.\nOne reason for lack of bone healing in nonunions is the absence of vascularization. In skeletogenesis, which is tightly linked to angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes the vascularization of the growth plate and transformation of cartilage to bone. We postulate that a gene-activated matrix (GAM), created with a plasmid coding for human VEGF165, coated on a collagen sponge could efficiently accelerate bone healing in large segmental defects.\nSixty New Zealand white rabbits received a 15-mm critical size defect on one radius, which was filled with either 0.1 or 1 mg plasmid-DNA as GAM. Radiographs were obtained every 3 weeks. After 6 or 12 weeks, animals were killed. New bone was measured by microCT scans. Vascularity was measured using anti-CD31 staining of endothelial cells in 18 regions of interest per implant.\nScaffold and control plasmid showed no defect healing, whereas most of the animals in the VEGF groups showed partial or total bone regeneration. Significantly more bone was found in the VEGF groups, with no significant differences between the 0.1- and 1-mg groups. Immunohistochemical staining of endothelial cells revealed that the VEGF groups showed two to three times the number of vessels and a significantly larger endothelial area after 6 weeks. Twelve weeks after surgery, the amount of vascularization decreased, whereas more new bone was detectable.\nThe rabbit critical size defect was appropriate in size to produce atrophic nonunions.

We have previously established that Klf6 is expressed in neuronal tissue, hindgut, heart, lung, kidney, and limb buds during midgestation. To explore the potential role of Klf6 in mouse development, we analyzed Klf6-/- mice and found that the homozygous mutation is embryonic lethal by embryonic day (E) 12.5 and associated with markedly reduced hematopoiesis and poorly organized yolk sac vascularization. Additionally, mRNA levels of Scl and Gata1 were reduced by approximately 80% in Klf6-/- yolk sacs. To further analyze this phenotype, we generated Klf6-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination, and compared their capacity to differentiate into the hematopoietic lineage with that of either Klf6+/- or Klf6+/+ ES cells. Consistent with the phenotype in the early embryo, Klf6-/- ES cells displayed significant hematopoietic defects following differentiation into EBs. Prolongation of epiblast-like cells and delays in mesoderm induction were also observed in the Klf6-/- EBs, associated with delayed expression of Brachyury, Klf1, and Gata1. Forced expression of KLF6 using a tet-inducible system enhanced the hematopoietic potential of wild-type EBs.

Components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are expressed in ovarian granulosa cells; nevertheless, its potential involvement in granulosa cell tumorigenesis has not been examined. To this end, human (n = 6) and equine (n = 18) granulosa cell tumors (GCT) were analyzed for beta-catenin expression by immunohistochemistry. Unlike granulosa cells of normal ovaries, most (15 of 24) GCT samples showed nuclear localization of beta-catenin, suggesting that activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays a role in the etiology of GCT. To confirm this hypothesis, Catnb(flox(ex3)/+); Amhr2(cre/+) mice that express a dominant stable beta-catenin mutant in their granulosa cells were generated. These mice developed follicle-like structures containing disorganized, pleiomorphic granulosa by 6 weeks of age. Even in older mice, these follicle-like lesions grew no larger than the size of antral follicles and contained very few proliferating cells. Similar to corpora lutea, the lesions were highly vascularized, although they did not express the luteinization marker Cyp11a1. Catnb(flox(ex3)/+); Amhr2(cre/+) females were also found to be severely subfertile, and fewer corpora lutea were found to form in response to exogenous gonadotropin compared with control mice. In older mice, the ovarian lesions often evolved into GCT, indicating that they represent a pretumoral intermediate stage. The GCT in Catnb(flox(ex3)/+); Amhr2(cre/+) mice featured many histopathologic similarities to the human disease, and prevalence of tumor development attained 57% at 7.5 months of age.

Selective catheterization and embolization of both uterine arteries, which are the predominant source of blood flow to fibroid tumors in most cases, is the cornerstone of treatment. Although embolization for treatment of uterine fibroid tumors is widely accepted, great familiarity with the normal and variant pelvic arterial anatomy is needed to ensure the safety and success of the procedure. The uterine artery classically arises as a first or second branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery and is usually dilated in the presence of a uterine fibroid tumor. Angiography is used for comprehensive pretreatment assessment of the pelvic arterial anatomy; for noninvasive evaluation, Doppler ultrasonography, contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and MR angiography also may be used. After the uterine artery is identified, selective catheterization should be performed distal to its cervicovaginal branch. For targeted embolization of the perifibroid arterial plexus, injection of particles with diameters larger than 500 mum is generally recommended. Excessive embolization may injure normal myometrium, ovaries, or fallopian tubes and lead to uterine necrosis or infection or to ovarian failure. Incomplete treatment or additional blood supply to the tumor (eg, via an ovarian artery) may result in clinical failure.

Angiogenesis-associated parameters are important prognosticators, and tumor blood vessels are an emerging target for therapy.

Tumor vascularization is higher in lymphoma tissue than in reactive lymph nodes and increases in step with clinically more aggressive lymphoma subtypes and advanced-stage disease. High levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in blood and tissue are associated with adverse prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors are also present in lymphoma cells. Therapy against vascular endothelial growth factor in animal models is effective and points to both the tumor cell and the host endothelium as targets. Structural microvessel abnormalities are present in some lymphoma subtypes. The role of angiogenesis might vary in lymphoma subtypes because the prognostic value of microvessel density and the expression of angiogenesis-related molecules differ between lymphoma subtypes. There are also differences in blood vessel phenotype between lymphoma subtypes. This heterogeneity may have implications for antiangiogenic therapies. Antiangiogenic therapy in human lymphoma is still in its infancy.\nThe role of angiogenesis in malignant lymphoma is evident. Tumor vasculature is an attractive target for lymphoma therapy.

We and others have shown that renal anlagen transplanted into animal hosts undergo differentiation and growth, become vascularized by blood vessels of host origin, exhibit excretory function and support life in otherwise anephric hosts. Renal anlagen can be transplanted across both concordant (rat to mouse) and highly disparate (pig to rodent) xenogeneic barriers. Similarly, pancreatic anlagen can be transplanted across concordant and highly disparate barriers, and undergo growth, differentiation and secrete insulin in a physiological manner following intra-peritoneal placement. Successful transplantation of organ primordia depends on obtaining them at defined windows during embryonic development within which the risk of teratogenicity is eliminated, growth potential is maximized, and immunogenicity is reduced.

{"title": "Human acellular dermal matrix for repair of abdominal wall defects: review of clinical experience and experimental data.", "abstract": "The use of prosthetic mesh for the tension-free repair of incisional hernias has been shown to be more effective than primary suture repair. Unfortunately, prosthetic materials can be a suboptimal choice in a variety of clinical scenarios. In general, prosthetic materials should not be implanted into sites with known contamination or infection because they lack an endogenous vascular network and are thus incapable of clearing bacteria. This is of particular relevance to the repair of recurrent hernias, which are often refractory to repair because of indolent bacterial colonization that weakens the site and retards appropriate healing. Although fascia lata grafts and muscle flaps can be employed for tension-free hernia repairs, they carry the potential for significant donor site morbidity. Recently, a growing number of clinicians have used human acellular dermal matrix as a graft material for the tension-free repair of ventral hernias. This material has been shown to become revascularized in both animal and human subjects. Once repopulated with a vascular network, this graft material is theoretically capable of clearing bacteria, a property not found in prosthetic graft materials. Unlike autologous materials such as fascial grafts and muscle flaps, acellular dermal matrix can be used without subjecting the patient to additional morbidity in the form of donor site complications. This article presents a thorough review of the current literature, describing the properties of human acellular dermal matrix and discussing both animal and human studies of its clinical performance. In addition to the review of previously published clinical experiences, we discuss our own preliminary results with the use of acellular dermal matrix for ventral hernia repair in 46 patients.", "journal": "Journal of long-term effects of medical implants", "date": "2005-10-13", "authors": ["Luther HHolton", "DanielKim", "Ronald PSilverman", "Eduardo DRodriguez", "NavinSingh", "Nelson HGoldberg"], "doi": "10.1615/jlongtermeffmedimplants.v15.i5.70"}
{"title": "Characterization of the bystander effect of somatostatin receptor sst2 after in vivo gene transfer into human pancreatic cancer cells.", "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and devastating human malignancies. The present study was conducted to determine whether in vivo sst2 gene transfer into human pancreatic tumors would impair tumor progression, and to characterize sst2 antitumoral bystander mechanisms. sst2 administration, using the synthetic vector PEI, strongly inhibited tumor progression of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, in vivo. sst2 gene transfer induced intratumoral production of its ligand somatostatin. Disruption of this autocrine loop by RNA interference completely reversed sst2 antitumoral activity. Mice depleted of natural killer (NK) cells did not hamper sst2 tumor growth inhibition. However, microvessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were markedly reduced in sst2-transfected tumors, whereas sst3 somatostatin receptor was upregulated. Depleting somatostatin by RNA interference completely abolished the sst2 inhibitory effect on VEGF expression and tumor angiogenesis, and sst2-induced sst3 expression in peripheral tumor vessels. We conclude that in vivo sst2 gene transfer elicited intratumoral somatostatin production and strongly impaired human pancreatic tumor growth. NK cells were not involved in this antitumoral bystander effect. VEGF and tumor vascularization were identified as novel targets for sst2-mediated antitumoral bystander effect. sst3 somatostatin receptor was upregulated in sst2-transfected tumors. Therefore, in vivo gene delivery of sst2 receptor to target the angiogenic process in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma might be a new therapeutic approach for treatment of pancreatic cancer in patients with unresectable disease.", "journal": "Human gene therapy", "date": "2005-10-13", "authors": ["NicolasCarrere", "FabienneVernejoul", "AnnySouque", "AmaniAsnacios", "NicoleVaysse", "LucienPradayrol", "ChristianeSusini", "LouisBuscail", "PierreCordelier"], "doi": "10.1089/hum.2005.16.1175"}

KS lesions from the onset are dispersed and multicentric. KS probability increases in solid organ transplant recipients (approximately 3/1000 patients). KS occurrence is associated with: type and dose of immunosuppression, chronic stimulation by foreign allograft antigens, viral infections (Herpes virus 8), anti rejection and induction therapy, etc. 90% of KS cases appear as dark blue or purplish macular lesions that may form nodular tumors. Histological picture shows networks of spindle shaped cells and vascular spaces surrounded by an endothelial cell layer. There is no uniform schema of KS treatment in renal transplant recipients. Immunosuppression must be reduced to the lowest levels which preserve allograft function. CsA should be converted to mofetil mycophenolate or mTOR-inhibitors.

The operations were performed in 12- to 16-week-old Balb/c mice weighing 25 to 30 grams as both donor and recipient animals. Extended vascularized groin cutaneous flaps based on the superficial epigastric vessels were used. A total of 10 groin cutaneous flaps were transplanted. Three temporary assisting suspension sutures of 11-0 nylon were placed at the 12-, 4-, and 8-o'clock positions to donor and recipient artery and vein before the anastomosis. This technique allowed atraumatic dissection of delicate and thin vessels, prevented vessel wall collapse, and facilitated adequate exposure of the lumen during placement of the permanent microvascular sutures. Thus, the microvascular anastomosis was performed in an unusual manner. The temporary assisting suspension sutures were removed just before the permanent suture was tied down. The mean operation time was 1 hour and 45 minutes with an ischemia time of 1 hour. Ninety-percent success in immediate and late-term patency rates was achieved, which was confirmed by transplant survival.

For these patients, pelvic reconstruction is needed to maintain the stability of the pelvis and the spinal column and to allow ambulation. In this report, the authors' experiences with pelvic ring reconstruction are described.\nPelvic ring reconstruction with free double-barreled vascularized fibular grafts was performed after resection of malignant pelvic tumors in five patients. The graft was fixed with a fixation plate and screws in three patients and with the Cotrel-Dubousset rod system in two patients. After surgery, perioperative and postoperative findings were evaluated.\nIn one patient, a pedicled rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap was transferred to repair defects of the skin and underlying soft tissue. The free fibular graft was transferred successfully in four of five patients; however, the graft was removed in one patient because of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After surgery, three of the four patients with successful grafts could walk with full weight bearing and without a cane; the fourth patient died as a result of multiple metastases to the lung before walking was attempted.\nThe double-barreled fibular graft is well vascularized and can achieve satisfactory bone union. It is a safe and effective method for reconstructing the pelvic ring.

An alternative is AlloDerm (decellularized human cadaveric dermis), which becomes vascularized and remodeled into autologous tissue after implantation. When used for fascial reconstruction, AlloDerm forms a strong repair, causes minimal abdominal adhesions, and resists infection.\nWe did a retrospective study of cancer patients at increased risk for mesh-related complications who underwent trunk reconstruction with AlloDerm over a 1-year period. Risk factors included unavoidable placement of mesh directly over the bowel or lung, perioperative irradiation, and/or bacterial contamination of the defect. The indications, defect characteristics, reconstructive techniques, complications, and surgical outcomes were evaluated.\nThirteen patients were included in the study. Indications for reconstruction were oncologic resection, resection of enterocutaneous fistula, and/or ventral hernia repair.

First, when immature female mice were treated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the number of ovulated oocytes was markedly decreased in ADAMTS-1 null mice in comparison to ADAMTS-1 (+/-) controls. The proportion of anovulated follicles to total mature follicles was significantly higher in ADAMTS-1 null females when compared with controls. The numbers of growing follicles at each stage were counted. The number of follicles at type 5b (late preantral) and later stages was markedly reduced in ADAMTS-1 null mice, irrespective of gonadotropin treatment (no gonadotropins, PMSG alone or PMSG/hCG). These data demonstrate that impairment of ovarian function to ovulate oocytes in ADAMTS-1 null mice occurs at two different levels: in the development of growing follicles and ovulatory processes. Furthermore, ADAMTS-1 null ovaries included a number of unusual atretic follicles that showed no sign of oocyte degeneration but lost the surrounding granulosa cell layers and were considered to be derived from type 4 or 5a follicles. These results suggest that ADAMTS-1 is important for follicular development beyond the type 4 and/or 5a and for maintaining normal granulosa cell layers in follicles. Finally, the number of large blood vessels in the medullar zone was significantly decreased in ADAMTS-1 null mice ovaries, suggesting that ADAMTS-1 is also involved in the organization of the medullary vascular network.", "journal": "Journal of molecular endocrinology", "date": "2005-10-12", "authors": ["MShozu", "NMinami", "HYokoyama", "MInoue", "HKurihara", "KMatsushima", "KKuno"], "doi": "10.1677/jme.1.01735"}

{"title": "Heterogeneous remodeling of lung vessels in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.", "abstract": "Recently, several reports suggest differences in the vascularization of the various histopathologic patterns of parenchymal remodeling seen in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). In this study, we sought to validate the importance of vascular remodeling in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to examine the relationship between vascular remodeling and parenchymal remodeling or pulmonary function. Open lung biopsies were performed in 57 patients with IPF, and vascular changes in alternating areas of parenchymal remodeling (UIP histologic patterns) were studied. Quantitative analysis of the internal area, internal perimeter, wall thickness, and surrounding cellularity of medium or large pulmonary arteries, as well as their distribution according to air/parenchymal ratios, was performed. Semiquantitative analysis also was used to determine the grade of vascular occlusion. An inverse association was found between vascularization and UIP parenchymal remodeling (p < 0.05); that is, the decreased internal luminal area and perimeter as well as the increased wall thickness run in parallel with progression from alveolar collapse toward severe mural-organizing fibrosis with honeycombing. Vascular regression (diminished internal area and perimeter of vessels) was also associated with higher FEV(1), FVC, and RV values (r = 0.48, p< 0.05), reflecting a tight relationship between vascular remodeling and pulmonary function. A progressive regression of vascularization, reflected by different degrees of luminal occlusion after vascular remodeling, coincided with parenchymal remodeling (alveolar collapse, mural-organizing fibrosis, and honeycombing).

The ATRA yielded several osseous branches supplying the tibial metaphysis and the anterior part of the tibial epiphysis and several rami supplying the anterior tibial tuberosity and the lower part of the patellar tendon. The ILGA ran under the lateral collateral ligament and had a horizontal direction towards the retro-patellar fat pad. The ILGA yielded 4-6 branches ascending or descending perpendicularly to its main direction. Full anastomoses between branches derived from the ATRA and the ILGA were observed in front and behind the lateral intercondylar tubercle in all the specimens, but each vessel seemed to provide predominantly the blood supply to a specific area. The anterior part of the LTC drew its blood supply from the ATRA, the posterior part from the ILGA and the mid-portion from both arteries. The standard anterolateral approach to LTC fractures with sub-meniscal arthrotomy appears particularly harmful to epiphyseal vascularization since it interrupts many of the branches deriving from the ILGA and ATRA.

We have generated transgenic mice expressing the nasopharyngeal carcinoma-derived CAO strain of LMP1 and LMP1 of the B95-8 strain, using the viral ED-L2 promoter for epithelial expression. LMP1(CAO) and LMP1(B95-8) induce transforming growth factor alpha expression and epidermal hyperplasia. However, levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) decline with the appearance of phosphorylated EGFR products, suggesting that the negative feedback loop upon EGFR expression is intact or that there is faster turnover at these early stages of carcinogenesis. In the L2LMP1(CAO) mice, increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor are also seen at an early stage in the skin. As the phenotype worsens, with increasing hyperplasia and vascularization leading to keratoacanthoma, p16(INK4a) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression is induced. The lesions can progress spontaneously to carcinoma. Carcinoma cell lines developed from these mice show high levels of total and phosphorylated EGFR. These data show that the induction of signaling through EGFR by LMP1 is an early event in carcinogenesis and that any inhibition upon EGFR expression is lifted during progression. Furthermore, expression of LMP1 is not sufficient to inhibit induction of p16(INK4a) in response to abnormal proliferation. These data are consistent with the cooperative effects seen between LMP1 and loss of the INK4a locus in transgenic mice and with the frequency of loss of this locus in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2005-10-06", "authors": ["DavidStevenson", "ChrystallaCharalambous", "Joanna BWilson"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0591"}

Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses of HIF-1alpha were performed to determine HIF-1alpha activation patterns. To simulate cartilage loss from disease or injury, the top layers of cartilage were removed from osteochondral explants, and the residual cartilage was assessed for HIF-1alpha immunolocalization and proteoglycan synthesis.\nWe demonstrated continuous nuclear translocation of HIF-1alpha in deeper layers of intact articular cartilage. HIF-1alpha was not completely degraded in chondrocytes exposed to normoxia, but rather, colocalized to the Golgi complex, a finding not previously reported for any cell type. Following alteration of the oxygen gradient by removal of the top layers of cartilage, predominantly perinuclear HIF-1alpha was found in the deeper layers. Restoration of intranuclear HIF-1alpha to these areas was achieved by hypoxia and simulated hypoxia. Under conditions in which HIF-1alpha was inactivated, matrix synthetic activity was altered (P < 0.0001) compared with control cartilage.\nThese findings demonstrate that hypoxia-dependent activation of HIF-1alpha is highly conserved and that changes in oxygen tensions following cartilage loss from injury or disease alter cartilage metabolism in part by changing HIF-1alpha activity.

{"title": "Redundant roles of VEGF-B and PlGF during selective VEGF-A blockade in mice.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and its 2 transmembrane tyrosine-kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, constitute a ligand-receptor signaling system that is crucial for developmental angiogenesis. VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF) activate VEGFR-1 selectively, however, mice lacking either ligand display only minor developmental defects. We hypothesized that the relative contributions of VEGF-B and PlGF to VEGFR-1 signaling may be masked in the presence of VEGF-A, which is abundantly expressed during postnatal development. To test this hypothesis, neonatal or adult mice were treated with a monoclonal antibody (G6-23-IgG) blocking murine VEGF-A or a soluble VEGFR-1 receptor IgG chimeric construct [mFlt(1-3)-IgG], which neutralizes VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF. Both compounds attenuated growth and survival of neonatal mice to similar extents and the pathophysiologic alterations, including a reduction in organ size and vascularization, changes in gene expression, and hematologic end points, were essentially indistinguishable. In adult mice, we observed only minor changes in response to treatment, which were similar between both anti-VEGF compounds. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PlGF and VEGF-B do not compensate during conditions of VEGF-A blockade, suggesting a minor role for compensatory VEGFR-1 signaling during postnatal development and vascular homeostasis in adults. The absence of compensatory VEGFR-1 signaling by VEGF-B and PlGF may have important implications for the development of anticancer strategies targeting the VEGF ligand/receptor system.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2005-09-29", "authors": ["Ajay KMalik", "Megan EBaldwin", "FranklinPeale", "GermaineFuh", "Wei-ChingLiang", "HenryLowman", "GloriaMeng", "NapoleoneFerrara", "Hans-PeterGerber"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2005-05-2047"}

The term \"stromatogenesis\" is used to describe this unique process that involves host peritumorous fibroblasts and is very different to reactive fibrosis.\nTo investigate the activation status of host fibroblasts at the invading tumour edge, assessed as MIB1 proliferation index and thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression. Results were related to vascular density and certain properties of invading cancer cells-MIB1 proliferation activity, TP expression, expression of endogenous markers of hypoxia (hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha; HIF1alpha) and acidity (lactate dehydrogenase-5; LDH5). Standard immunohistochemical techniques were applied to 150 colorectal adenocarcinomas.\nNormal fibroblasts at the tumour edge had a median MIB1 index of 2%-significantly higher than normal submucosal fibroblasts (0.3%) and significantly lower than cancer cells (40%). Normal peritumorous fibroblasts with a proliferation rate above the median strongly expressed TP and were supported by an increased vascular network. Cancer cells close to these fibroblasts had a high MIB1 proliferative index, high HIF1alpha and LDH5 reactivity, and a clear trend to extramural extension. All associations were significant.\nThese results suggest that activated fibroblastic status at the invading tumour front sets the stage for stromatogenesis and new blood vessel formation, facilitating deep transmural invasion in colorectal adenocarcinomas. This complicity of peritumorous fibroblasts in the overall aggressiveness/invasive and metastatic ability of colorectal tumours, occurring within the framework of cancer-stromal cell interactions, is probably favoured by the altered microenvironmental conditions of hypoxia and acidity.", "journal": "Journal of clinical pathology", "date": "2005-09-29", "authors": ["ESivridis", "AGiatromanolaki", "M IKoukourakis"], "doi": "10.1136/jcp.2005.026260"}

This study investigates the anatomical details of this muscle in 13 fresh male cadavers. The medial plantar artery (MPA) was studied by dissection and macroscopic analyses to document the relationship of its superficial and deep branches with respect to the abductor hallucis muscle (AHM). Three main patterns could be described. In Pattern A (54%) the MPA divides into two branches. The deep branch reaches the deep surface of the AHM, supplying its proximal part, and the superficial branch courses between the AHM and the flexor digitorum brevis, to end as the first plantar metatarsal artery. The latter supplies two to three small branches to the distal part of the AHM. The fibers of the AHM end symmetrically on the two sides of the tendon and the muscle presents an arciform shape. The MPA, in Pattern B (38%), lacks a deep branch and continues along the lateral border of the AHM as a superficial branch that supplies proximal and distal collaterals to the muscle. The muscle fibers of the AHM end mainly on the medial side of the tendon. The muscle belly presents an arciform shape and is located on the medial margin of the foot superomedially with respect to Pattern A. In Pattern C (8%) the MPA continues as a large deep branch on the deep surface of the AHM and ends as the medial collateral artery of the big toe. A smaller superficial branch of the MPA provides a few collaterals to the AHM from its proximal part and to the flexor digitorum brevis in its distal part. The AHM fibers end mainly on the lateral side of the tendon and morphologically the muscle presents a straight line on the sole of the foot compared to Pattern A. Although Patterns B and C, from a surgical point of view, necessitate interruption of the main trunk of the MPA, Pattern A may permit the vascularization of the muscles of the medial side of the sole of the foot by the superficial trunk of the MPA. Because preoperative radiological study of the plantar vessels correlate with the morphological characteristics of the AHM observed during surgery, such imaging may be useful in determining the appropriate flap design based on the patient's unique pattern of MPA branching.", "journal": "Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2005-09-28", "authors": ["VeronicaMacchi", "CesareTiengo", "AndreaPorzionato", "CarlaStecco", "AnnaParenti", "FrancescoMazzoleni", "RalphGer", "RaffaeleDe Caro"], "doi": "10.1002/ca.20147"}
{"title": "Cyclin D1 genotype and expression in sporadic hemangioblastomas.", "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas are highly-vascularized tumors occurring in sporadic form or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). The VHL protein (pVHL) regulates various target genes, one of which is the CCND1 gene, encoding cyclin D1, a protein that plays a critical role in the control of the cell cycle. Overexpression of cyclin D1 is found in many cancers. The CCND1 gene contains a common G --> A polymorphism (870G > A) that enhances alternative splicing of the gene. CCND1 genotype is associated with clinical outcome in a number of cancers although prognostic significance varies with tumor type. In VHL disease, CCND1 genotype has been suggested as a genetic modifier that influences susceptibility to hemangioblastomas. In order to analyze whether CCND1 genotype plays a role in sporadic CNS hemangioblastomas, we investigated CCND1 genotype in tumor tissue of 17 sporadic and also in five VHL-related CNS hemangioblastomas. In addition, in these tumors the extent and localization of cyclin D1 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry. We found no deviation in CCND1 genotype distribution and allele frequencies from expected values. Also, there was no correlation between age at onset and CCND1 genotype. The expression of cyclin D1 as detected by immunohistochemistry was highly variable within and between tumors, without a clear correlation with CCND1 genotype. We conclude that, whereas variable but sometimes high cyclin D1 expression is a feature of sporadic hemangioblastomas, CCND1 genotype is unlikely to be an important genetic modifier in the oncogenesis of these tumors.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2005-09-28", "authors": ["Johanna M MGijtenbeek", "Sandra H EBoots-Sprenger", "BarbaraFranke", "PieterWesseling", "Judith W MJeuken"], "doi": "10.1007/s11060-004-7326-z"}

However, some patients, especially after adjuvant radiotherapy, may develop severe chronic wounds resulting in persistent tracheocutaneous fistula. Local wound care and plastic reconstruction strategies are required in such cases. We present two patients with head and neck cancer treated with primary surgical regimen including temporary tracheostomy and adjuvant radiotherapy. Both patients developed a persistent, poorly healing wound with persistent tracheocutaneous tissue defect. After local debridement and wound care, the peristomal necrotic tissue was excised down to the level of the trachea. The defect of the anterior tracheal wall was closed with a autogenous ear cartilage graft. The graft was harvested from the cavum conchae and sutured to the tracheal defect. The soft tissue defect was covered by transposition of a well-vascularized, fasciocutaneous deltopectoral flap. In both cases, the flaps healed satisfactorily. The donor defect was closed primarily. Complications were not observed in these two cases. A flexible tracheo-bronchoscopy showed no stenosis of the trachea at the site of cartilage graft transplantation.

{"title": "The impact of proteinase-induced matrix degradation on the release of VEGF from heparinized collagen matrices.", "abstract": "The in vivo application of engineered matrices in human wound healing processes is often hampered by the slow rate of vascularization. Therefore much research is directed towards enhancing the angiogenic properties of such matrices. One approach for enhancing the vascularization is the incorporation of angiogenic growth factors. Recently, we and others have reported on immobilizing such factors into collagen matrices either by covalent attachment or by physical binding to covalently incorporated heparin. Especially the latter procedure has been shown to lead to substantial increase rates in vascularization in in vivo experiments. The increases have been proposed to depend on the sustained release of the incorporated angiogenic growth factors from the heparinized collagen matrices. In this paper, we report on investigations to study the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from collagen matrices under conditions which mimic potential in vivo situations. Relevant proteinase concentrations were deduced from in vitro experiments in which we evaluated the secretion of selected matrix metalloproteinases from fibroblasts in contact with collagen. The release of VEGF from non-modified, cross-linked and heparinized collagen matrices in the absence and in the presence of varying concentrations of proteinases was then determined by ELISA and liquid scintillation counting. The release behaviour appears to be controlled by both the presence of heparin and the levels of proteinases applied. Experiments with matrices containing radioactively labelled heparin suggest that VEGF release results from the consecutive and simultaneous release of three species of VEGF molecules that differ in their binding affinities to the differently modified collagen matrices. The species binding specifically to heparin most likely accounts for the previously observed increases in angiogenic potential between loading VEGF to non-heparinized and heparinized collagen matrices.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2005-09-27", "authors": ["ChangYao", "MartinRoderfeld", "TimoRath", "ElkeRoeb", "J\u00fcrgenBernhagen", "GuySteffens"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.08.037"}

The presence of calcitonin receptor, calcitonin receptor-like receptor, and receptor activity-modifying proteins in human microvessel endothelial-1 cells was tested by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). The proangiogenic action of calcitonin was examined in several in vitro models of angiogenesis using HMEC-1 cells and also in vivo using dorsal skinfold assays. Calcitonin expression of PC-3M cells was modulated, and its effect on angiogenesis was examined in in vitro as well as in vivo models. The results of RT-PCR and radioligand receptor assays showed the presence of functional calcitonin receptor in HMEC-1 cells. Calcitonin stimulated all phases of angiogenesis through the calcitonin receptor, but its effect on tube morphogenesis by endothelial cells occurred at the concentration of the Kd of calcitonin receptor. Silencing of calcitonin receptor expression in HMEC-1 cells abolished calcitonin-induced tube formation. Vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies attenuated but did not abolish calcitonin-induced tube morphogenesis. PC-3M prostate cancer cells induced angiogenesis in in vivo and in vitro models.

The fifth kringle domain (K5) of human plasminogen is distinct from angiostatin and has been shown, on its own, to act as a potent endothelial cell inhibitor. We propose that tumor-targeted K5 cDNA expression may act as an effective therapeutic intervention as part of a cancer gene therapy strategy. In this study, we provide evidence that eukaryotically expressed His-tagged human K5 cDNA (hK5His) is exported extracellularly and maintains predicted disulfide bridging conformation in solution. Functionally, hK5His protein produced by retrovirally engineered human U87MG glioma cells suppresses in vitro migration of both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human macrophages. Subcutaneous implantation of Matrigel-embedded hK5His-producing glioma cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice reveals that hK5His induces a marked reduction in blood vessel formation and significantly suppresses the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating CD45+ Mac3+ Gr1- macrophages. Therapeutically, we show in a nude mouse orthotopic brain cancer model that tumor-targeted K5 expression is capable of effectively suppressing glioma growth and promotes significant long-term survival (>120 days) of test animals. These data suggest that plasminogen K5 acts as a novel two-pronged anticancer agent, mediating its inhibitory effect via its action on host-derived endothelial cells and tumor-associated macrophages, resulting in a potent, clinically relevant antitumor effect.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2005-09-17", "authors": ["Sabrina RPerri", "JosephineNalbantoglu", "BorhaneAnnabi", "ZafiroKoty", "LaurenceLejeune", "Mo\u00efraFran\u00e7ois", "Marcos RDi Falco", "RichardB\u00e9liveau", "JacquesGalipeau"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0508"}

All patients were non-smokers. On the buccal site the bone dehiscence ranged between 3 and 9 mm. Primary stability was achieved in all but one implant. The exposed threads were covered with a xenograft (Bio-Oss) and a non-resorbable expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. The flap was sutured leaving the implant head non-submerged. The membrane was removed when (1) the membrane became exposed or (2) after a maximum of 24 weeks. All implants received singular cemented crowns. The implants were followed for a period ranging from 12 to 114 months. Whole-mouth plaque index (Pl), the % of bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth and signs of peri-implantitis were recorded. Every year periapical radiographs were taken using a long cone technique.\nAll but one implant integrated successfully. At the time of membrane removal, all previously exposed threads were completely covered with richly vascularized tissue except for two implants where the coverage reached 63% and 87%, respectively. The whole-mouth plaque score and BOP remained low in all patients during the observation period. None of the implants had plaque and, except for one implant BOP never occurred. All implants were stable and in function. Swelling, redness or purulence was never observed. On the periapical radiographs no bone resorption was observed on the mesial and distal site except for one implant in one patient with a mesial and distal bone resorption of 2 and 3 mm. Probing depth was never higher than 3 mm except for one patient where the implant was placed deeply subgingival for esthetical reasons.\nThis prospective long-term study shows that with the use of non-submerged transmucosal implants, large bony dehiscences can be treated in a one-stage approach using a stiff non-resorbable membrane combined with a xenograft.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2005-09-17", "authors": ["Annemarie LDe Boever", "Jan ADe Boever"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0501.2005.01154.x"}

The aim of this study was to visualize the course of the arteries using different techniques, to perform macroscopic- and microscopic analyses, and to develop recommendations for incisions in implant dentistry.\nThe vascular systems of seven edentulous human cadavers were flushed out and filled with either red-colored rubber bond or Indian ink and formalin mixture. After fixation a macroscopic preparation was performed to reveal the course, distribution and supply area of the major vessels. In the area of the edentulous alveolar ridge specimens of the mucosa were taken and analyzed microscopically.\nThe analyses revealed the major features of mucosal vascularization.

Both X-linked disorders are due to mutations in the NDP gene, which encodes a 133 amino acid protein called Norrin, but autosomal recessive (AR) and autosomal dominant (AD) forms of FEVR have also been described. In this study, we report the molecular findings and the related phenotype in five Spanish families affected with Norrie disease or XL-FEVR due to mutations of the NDP gene.\nThe study was conducted in 45 subjects from five Spanish families. These families were clinically diagnosed with Norrie disease or similar conditions. The three exons of the NDP gene were analyzed by automatic DNA sequencing. Haplotype analyses were also performed.\nTwo new nonsense mutations, apart from other mutations previously described in the NDP gene, were found in those patients affected with ND or X-linked FEVR.\nAn important genotype-phenotype variation was found in relation to the different mutations of the NDP gene.

{"title": "Salzmann's nodular degeneration of the cornea: a review and case series.", "abstract": "Salzmann's nodular degeneration is a rare, noninflammatory, slowly progressive, degenerative condition. Bluish-white nodules raised above the surface of the cornea characterize it. It has usually developed in corneas with a history of phlyctenulosis, trachoma, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, measles, scarlet fever, and various other viral diseases. However, today the majority of cases have been seen without recognized previous keratitis. It is composed of dense irregularly arranged collagen tissue with hyalinization between epithelium and Bowman's layer or beyond. Manual removal, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) with or without the use of topical mitomycin-C, lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty have been used in the treatment of this disease. Salzmann's nodular degeneration does not seem to consist of one clinical entity. In some cases, elevated and pannus-like tissue can be separated easily from the corneal surface leaving Bowman's layer almost untouched. In these eyes, subsequent PTK may be necessary to smooth the surface. Recurrences are rare in these eyes. In contrast, some eyes (often with major peripheral vascularization) are left with deep defects in Bowman's layer and superficial stroma after difficult mechanical removal of nodules. In these eyes, multiple masking/laser ablation procedures are mandatory to acquire a homogenous surface. In our experience, the required laser ablation depth is significantly greater and the best-corrected visual acuity to be expected is reduced in contrast to the eyes with easy removal of the nodules. In these eyes recurrences seem to occur more frequently after treatment. Of 35 eyes documented to have Salzmann's nodular degeneration during the last 15 years in our department, 22 needed PTK treatment. Visual acuity increased from 0.4 to 0.7 on average. As a routine, laser ablation should be combined with previous conventional removal of nodules and excessive pannus tissue.

The developing chick embryo brain was assessed as a new xenograft model for the production, growth, and study of human and rat glioma cell lines. Three established glioma lines (U-87 MG, C6, and 9L) were injected into chick embryo brain ventricles on embryonic day (E) 5 and brains were examined after several days to two weeks after injection. All glioma lines survived, produced vascularized intraventricular tumors, and invaded the brain in a manner similar to that in rodents. Rat C6 glioma cells spread along vasculature and also invaded the neural tissue. Human U-87 glioma cells migrated along vasculature and exhibited slight invasion of neural tissue. Rat 9L gliosarcoma cells were highly motile, but migrated only along the vasculature. A derivative of 9L cells that stably expressed the cell surface adhesion molecule NgCAM/L1 was produced and also injected into chick embryo brain ventricles to see if this protein could facilitate tumor cell migration away from the vasculature into areas such as axonal tracts. 9L/NgCAM cells, however, did not migrate away from the vasculature and, thus, this protein alone cannot be responsible for diffuse invasiveness of some gliomas. 9L/NgCAM cell motility was assessed in vitro using sophisticated time-lapse microscopy and quantitative analysis, and was significantly altered compared to parental 9L cells.

Its role in lung cancer is, however, still unknown. In the present study, we assessed the expression of Src in three different human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC-9, PC14PE6, A549), and explored the effect of a novel Src kinase inhibitor, M475271, on the behavior of the cell lines. The three cell lines expressed various levels of auto-phosphorylated Src. While M475271 reduced Src-phosphorylation and invasiveness of all three cell lines, it inhibited the proliferation of PC-9 and A549 cells with highly phosphorylated Src, but not PC14PE6 cells. We further examined the effect of M475271 on subcutaneous tumors and lung metastasis caused by PC-9 and/or A549 cells in NK-cell depleted SCID mice. Daily oral treatment with M475271 inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors with PC-9 and A549 cells via inhibition of tumor cells proliferation, VEGF production and/or vascularization in the mice in a dose-dependent manner. In the metastasis model with A549 cells, the lung weight in the M475271 (50 mg/kg)-treated group was less than that of the control group, despite no difference in the number of metastatic nodules. Our results suggest that inhibition of tyrosine kinase Src by M475271 could reduce the growth, invasion and VEGF-mediated neovascularization of lung adenocarcinoma cells, resulting in inhibition of growth of subcutaneous tumors and lung metastasis.

A total of 93 blastocysts obtained by nuclear transfer of somatic cells (granulosa cells) were transferred into 41 recipient ewes, and pregnancies were monitored by ultrasound scanning. In vitro derived, fertilized embryos (IVF, n=123) were also transferred to assess oocyte competence, and naturally mated ewes (n=120) were analysed as well. Cloned embryos developed to the blastocyst stage and implanted at the same rate as IVF embryos. After day 30 of gestation, however, dramatic losses occurred, and only 12 out of 93 (13%) clones reached full-term development, compared to 51 out of 123 (41.6%) lambs born from the IVF control embryos. Three full-term lamb clones were delivered stillborn, as a result of placental degeneration. A further five clone recipients developed hydroallantois. Their lambs died within 24h following delivery by caesarian section, and displayed degenerative lesions in liver and kidney resulting from the severe hydroallantois. One set of twins was delivered by assisted parturition at day 150, but died 24h later due to respiratory distress syndrome. The remaining two clone recipients underwent caesarian section, and the corresponding two lambs displayed signs of respiratory dysfunction and died at approximately 1 month of age due to a bacterial complication. Blood samples collected from the cloned lambs after birth revealed a wide range of abnormalities indicative of kidney and liver dysfunction. Macroscopical and histopathological examination of the placentae revealed a marked reduction in vascularization, particularly at the apex of the villous processes, as well as a loss of differentiation of the trophoblastic epithelium.

On ultrasound, the mass had a tissue density and sharp contours; the mass was not highly vascularized on Doppler. MRI revealed a mass that enhanced markedly on both early and late contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences and was hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences.

Consequently, a successful antiangiogenic therapy should provide long-term inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis, suggesting long-term gene transfer as a therapeutic strategy. In this study a soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sFlt-1) and an angiostatin-endostatin fusion gene (statin-AE) were codelivered to human glioblastoma xenografts by nonviral gene transfer using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon. In subcutaneously implanted xenografts, co-injection of both transgenes showed marked anti-tumor activity as demonstrated by reduction of tumor vessel density, inhibition or abolition of glioma growth, and increase in animal survival (P = 0.003). Using luciferase-stable engrafted intracranial gliomas, the anti-tumor effect of convection-enhanced delivery of plasmid DNA into the tumor was assessed by luciferase in vivo imaging. Sustained tumor regression of intracranial gliomas was achieved only when statin-AE and sFlt-1 transposons were coadministered with SB-transposase-encoding DNA to facilitate long-term expression.

Retinal capillary hemangiomas are the most common manifestation of VHL disease, which can occur in the optic nerve, where it may simulate disc edema, or in the retinal periphery, which is characterized by massive retinal exudation. Both locations can result in progressive accumulation of exudates leading to a decrease in visual acuity and potentially to a serous retinal detachment.\nA juxtapapillary hemangioma was observed in a 72-year-old man who presented for a routine examination. The patient was asymptomatic, despite the presence of a trace afferent papillary defect. This finding had to be carefully differentiated from sectoral disc edema. Blood tests, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) all had normal results. Fluorescein angiography was a valuable secondary test showing early filling of the vascular network overlying the nerve head and characteristic late hyperfluorescence.\nThere are 2 distinct forms of capillary hemangiomas--the juxtapapillary tumor or the peripheral capillary hemangioma.

The folding techniques are theoretically less prone to these risks, although they have other disadvantages due to the bulky ureter. According to the literature, these 2 approaches have similar complication rates of 4% to 25%, to include stenosis, reflux and leakage. We introduce a modified ureteroplasty technique with the aim of ensuring effective reduction of the ureteral diameter with minor risks to the vasculature.\nA total of 42 consecutive patients underwent ureteroplasty and reimplantation (Cohen 16, Politano-Leadbetter 3, psoas hitch 23) between 1994 and 2004, and were followed for 1 to 9 years. The ureter was opened longitudinally on its less vascularized area. Two parallel longitudinal incisions were made from the luminal side up to the musculature layer, leaving the adventitia untouched. The mucosal aspects lateral to these lines were discarded. The inner layer was closed with a running suture. The adventitial layer was closed with single stitches.\nNo leakage, stenosis or reflux was observed. In 3 ureters persistent dilatation was observed, without obstruction or reflux.\nOur modification combines some principles of the 2 classic techniques, with the purpose of decreasing the risks and disadvantages of both. We believe that our approach affords better preservation of the ureteral vasculature because the adventitia is preserved untouched, as well as effective caliber reduction so that the bulking problem is avoided.

We investigated the importance of microvessel density (MVD), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (Flk-1) immunohistochemical expression in a large series of small conventional clear cell renal carcinomas treated with partial nephrectomy and assessed the prognostic value of their expression in terms of patients survival at long-term followup.\nA total of 48 patients with a mean age +/- SD of 58.2 +/- 9.5 years who had conventional single RCC were considered. Median tumor diameter was 2.92 +/- 0.82 cm (range 1.3 to 5). Disease was grades 1 to 4 in 15, 29, 2 and 2 patients, respectively. Median followup was 92.9 months (range 17 to 186).\nFour patients (3.9%) had died of metastatic renal cancer at a median followup of 23.5 months, of whom 1 had a grade 2, 1 had a grade 3 and 2 had grade 4 RCC. Patients with MVD expression higher than the median (44.4 vessels per mm) did not show a significant difference in survival compared to patients with MVD expression lower than the median. Patients with VEGF expression higher than 25% in the histological specimen showed worse survival than patients with VEGF expression lower than 25%. Different Flk-1 expression did not determine a significant difference in survival. On univariate analysis of patient survival in relation to the different considered factors Fuhrman grading was the most important factor for survival.\nOur study shows that recurrence and death are possible even in patients with small renal tumors. MVD, VEGF and Flk-1 expression do not depend on tumor size in pT1a RCC. Therefore, to date Fuhrman grading appears to be the only factor predictive of survival even in small RCC. Thus, Fuhrman grading is predictive of mortality.

However, the lack of IL-6 or T and B cells did not impact on tumor growth. While IL-6 did not regulate tumor growth or tumor vascularization, gp130(757F/F)/IL-6(-/-) mice showed approximately 10-20-fold more submucosal tumor invasion, reduced mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate, and greater IL-11 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 and MMP-9 synthesis than gp130(757F/F) mice.

In addition, treatment with recombinant IL-11 stimulated expression of MMP-13 and MMP-9 in stomachs of wild-type mice.\nIncreased submucosal invasion in gp130(757F/F)/IL-6(-/-) mice could not be explained by increased vascularization or reduced immunosurveillance but was most likely facilitated by augmented metalloproteinase activity driven by elevated IL-11 levels.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "date": "2005-09-07", "authors": ["MeeganHowlett", "Louise MJudd", "BrendanJenkins", "Nicole LLa Gruta", "DianneGrail", "MatthiasErnst", "Andrew SGiraud"], "doi": "10.1053/j.gastro.2005.06.068"}

Light microscopy of Masson-stained, paraffin-embedded transverse tissue sections served to attribute cast vascular structures to defined layers of bile ducts and gallbladder. In all segments of the bile tract, a mucosal and a subserosal vascular network was found. In glandular segments, the mucosal network was composed of a meshwork of subepithelial and circumglandular capillaries, which serve the mucosal functions. Differences in the angioarchitectonic patterns existed only in the subserosal networks as hepatic ducts own one supplying arteriole only, while the common bile duct owns a well-defined rete arteriosum subserosum. A well-developed dense subserosus venous plexus was present throughout the bile tract. Vascular patterns of the gallbladder body resembled those of the bile duct, whereby the dense subserous venous plexus was located close to the mucosal capillary network. The subserosal network in the neck of the gallbladder resembled that of the cystic duct. Spatial changes of the mucosal vascular network during volume changes of the gallbladder were documented. Measurements from tissue sections revealed bile tract diameters of 220-400 microm (extrahepatic ducts), 500-650 microm (cystic duct), and 4-6 mm (common bile duct). Data gained from high-powered SEM micrographs of vascular corrosion casts revealed vessel diameters of 200 microm (cystic artery), 90-110 microm (cystic vein), 30-40 microm (feeding arterioles), and 25-110 microm (subserosal venules).

This article presents three cases with penile skin defects treated by means of a pedicled fascia lata attached either to the tensor fascia lata (one case) or an anterolateral thigh flap (two cases). The cause of the wounds included electrical burn, Fournier's gangrene, and self-mutilation. The size of flaps ranged from 10-13 cm in width and 15-30 cm in length. All flaps included vascularized fascia lata, which covered part or the circumference of the penis. All flaps survived completely. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh was included in the designed flaps in all instances, and normal protective sensation was recorded postoperatively. The patients reported normal erectile function and ability to perform intercourse. The flaps, though relatively bulky and hairy, had a good color and texture match with the penis and suprapubic region. Based on our limited experience, we believe that the anterolateral thigh flap has greater dimensions with a longer pedicle, and allows for greater flexibility in flap design compared to the tensor fascia lata flap. An anterolateral thigh flap can be safely thinned in a second stage, and it is our flap of choice for penis resurfacing.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2005-09-06", "authors": ["Andreas IGravvanis", "Dimosthenis ATsoutsos", "Thomais GIconomou", "Stefanos GPapadopoulos"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.20149"}

Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies showed that this effect is tied to an increased expression of PAR2 coupled to cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Pharmacological dissection performed with specific inhibitors confirmed the functional involvement of cyclooxygenase-2 in PAR2 vasodilatory effect. This vasodilatory response was confirmed to be dependent on expression of PAR2 in the smooth muscle component by immunohistochemistry studies performed on aorta isolated by both NOD-III and transgenic PAR2 mice.\nOur data demonstrate an important role for PAR2 in modulating vascular arterial response in diabetes and suggest that this receptor could represent an useful therapeutic target.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2005-09-06", "authors": ["FiorentinaRoviezzo", "MariarosariaBucci", "VincenzoBrancaleone", "AnnaritaDi Lorenzo", "PierangeloGeppetti", "SilvanaFarneti", "LucaParente", "GiuseppeLungarella", "StefanoFiorucci", "GiuseppeCirino"], "doi": "10.1161/01.ATV.0000184770.01494.2e"}
{"title": "Blood monocytes mimic endothelial progenitor cells.", "abstract": "The generation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from blood monocytes has been propagated as a novel approach in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and lectin binding together with endothelial marker expression are commonly used to define these EPCs. Considerable controversy exists regarding their nature, in particular, because myelomonocytic cells share several properties with endothelial cells (ECs). This study was performed to elucidate whether the commonly used endothelial marker determination is sufficient to distinguish supposed EPCs from monocytes. We measured endothelial, hematopoietic, and progenitor cell marker expression of monocytes before and after angiogenic culture by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The function of primary monocytes and monocyte-derived supposed EPCs was investigated during vascular network formation and EC colony-forming unit (CFU-EC) development. Monocytes cultured for 4 to 6 days under angiogenic conditions lost CD14/CD45 and displayed a commonly accepted EPC phenotype, including LDL uptake and lectin binding, CD31/CD105/CD144 reactivity, and formation of cord-like structures. Strikingly, primary monocytes already expressed most tested endothelial genes and proteins at even higher levels than their supposed EPC progeny. Neither fresh nor cultured monocytes formed vascular networks, but CFU-EC formation was strictly dependent on monocyte presence. LDL uptake, lectin binding, and CD31/CD105/CD144 expression are inherent features of monocytes, making them phenotypically indistinguishable from putative EPCs. Consequently, monocytes and their progeny can phenotypically mimic EPCs in various experimental models.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2005-09-06", "authors": ["EvaRohde", "ChristinaMalischnik", "DanielaThaler", "TheresaMaierhofer", "WernerLinkesch", "GerhardLanzer", "ChristianGuelly", "DirkStrunk"], "doi": "10.1634/stemcells.2005-0072"}

Remarkably, in both Ihh-/- and Ihh-/-; Gli3-/- embryos, vascularization promoted osteoblast development in perichondrial progenitor cells.

To our knowledge, there have been no prospective case-controlled studies comparing the effectiveness of vascularized fibular grafting with that of nonvascularized fibular grafting for the prevention of progression and collapse of the lesion.\nNineteen patients (twenty-three hips) with a large osteonecrotic lesion of the femoral head (Stage IIC in ten hips, Stage IIIC in two, and Stage IVC in eleven, according to the classification system of Steinberg et al.) underwent vascularized fibular grafting. This group was retrospectively matched according to the etiology, stage, and size of the lesion to a group of nineteen patients (twenty-three hips) who underwent nonvascularized fibular grafting during the same time period. A prospective case-controlled study of the two groups, with a mean duration of follow-up of four years, was then performed.\nThe mean Harris hip score improved for 70% of the hips treated with a vascularized graft and 35% of the hips treated with a nonvascularized graft (p < 0.05). At the time of the final follow-up, nine of the ten hips with a Stage-IIC lesion treated with a vascularized fibular graft had not collapsed whereas seven of the thirteen hips with a larger lesion (Stage IIIC or IVC) had collapsed. Three hips (13%) were converted to a total hip replacement. The mean dome depression measured 2.8 mm. In the group treated with a nonvascularized graft, five of the ten Stage-IIC hips had not collapsed and eleven of the thirteen hips with a larger lesion had collapsed.

The effect of BMP-2 overexpression on tumor vascularization was also analyzed in xenografts of human BMP-2 transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MCF-7/BMP2) in mice.\nBMP receptor activation selectively induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in contrast to the ERK1/2 MAP kinases. In keeping with this finding, BMP-2 had no significant effect on endothelial cell proliferation but promoted HDMEC tube formation in the matrigel assay. The transcription factor inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1), which is known to play an important role in neovascularization of tumors, was confirmed as a BMP target in HDMECs.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated markedly higher expression of Ppara, Pparg, and Rxra mRNA in labyrinth zone trophoblast as compared with basal zone near term. There was also a marked increase in Pparg (65%, P < 0.05) and Ppara (91%, P < 0.05) mRNA specifically in the labyrinth zone over the final third of pregnancy.

Placental expression of Ppara, Ppard, and Rxra was unaffected by dexamethasone treatment.

{"title": "Early-outgrowth of endothelial progenitor cells can function as antigen-presenting cells.", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been recently found to exist circulating in peripheral blood of adults, and home to sites of neovascularization in peripheral tissues. They can also be differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs). In tumor tissues, EPCs are found in highly vascularized lesions. Few reports exist in the literature concerning the characteristics of EPCs, especially related to their surface antigen expressions, except for endothelial markers. Here, we aimed to investigate the surface expression of differentiation markers, and the functional activities of early-outgrowth of EPCs (EO-EPCs), especially focusing on their antigen-presenting ability. EO-EPCs were generated from PBMNCs, by culture in the presence of angiogenic factors. These EO-EPCs had the morphological and functional features of endothelial cells and, additionally, they shared antigen-presenting ability. They induced the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes in a mixed-lymphocyte reaction, and could generate cytotoxic lymphocytes, with the ability to lyze tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner. The antigen-presenting ability of EO-EPCs, however, was weaker than that of monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but stronger than peripheral blood monocytes. Since EO-EPCs play an important role in the development of tumor angiogenesis, targeting EPCs would be an effective anti-angiogenic strategy. Alternatively, due to their antigen-presenting ability, EO-EPCs can be used as the effectors of anti-tumor immunotherapy. Since they share endothelial antigens, the activation of a cellular immunity against angiogenic vessels can be expected.

SU6668 was used as the antiangiogenic drug and recombinant murine B7.2-IgG fusion protein was used to stimulate T cell-mediated immune destruction of tumor cells. SU6668 is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of three angiogenic receptors VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR), PDGFRbeta and FGFR1 that play a crucial role in tumor-induced vascularization. Our studies show that B7.2-IgG treatment of mice with established RM1 prostate tumors resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were responsible for this effect. SU6668 therapy substantially inhibited tumor vascularization and tumor growth. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with SU6668 in combination with B7.2-IgG, the antitumor effects were substantially higher than in mice treated separately with SU6668 or B7.2-IgG. Prolonged treatment of mice with SU6668 did not inhibit the immunoreactivity of T lymphocytes. On the contrary, T cells from mice treated with a combination of SU6668 and B7.2-IgG showed higher proliferative responses and cytokine production following anti-CD3 stimulation than T cells of mice treated separately with these modalities. These results indicate that antiangiogenic and immune therapies using SU6668 and B7.2-IgG are compatible and manifest complementary antitumor effects.

Vascularized free-fibula transfer allows the potential for rapid autograft incorporation in areas compromised by radiation, chemotherapy, and resection. A retrospective case series of vascularized free-fibula transfers for humeral reconstructions is reported. Fifteen patients were identified; nine had surgery for glenohumeral arthrodesis (three primary fusions, six salvage/revision), four had surgery for intercalary defects (three primary reconstructions, one salvage), one patient had an onlay graft for a pathologic fracture in irradiated bone, and one patient had an osteoarticular graft. Average followup was 68 months. One patient died from disease 41 months after surgery. Oncologic outcome was excellent with no local recurrence and preservation of all limbs. There were an average of 0.8 major complications (requiring reoperation) and 0.5 minor complications per patient. The most frequent complication was fracture, occurring in six of 15 patients. All patients went on to bony union except two patients with glenohumeral arthrodesis with asymptomatic fibrous unions. Mean time to union was 12 months.

To date, this has been achieved using rat, pig and human metanephroi, with unilateral nephrectomy (UNX) of recipient rats a requisite of renal development. The aim of this study was to adapt this approach for use in mice and examine the parameters affecting successful onward development in this species.\nMetanephroi at embryonic age (E) 13.5 were transplanted either onto the body wall, abdominal fat pads or omentum of recipient isogenic C57/Bl6 mice using either sutures or polyglycolic acid mesh. Having established greatest success with polyglycolic acid mesh on the body wall, E12.5 and 15.5 days metanephroi from C57/Bl6 mice were then transplanted onto the body wall of control (non-pregnant non-UNX), UNX or 12.5 days post-coitum pregnant isogenic recipients. After 7 days, implanted tissue was harvested and examined using histology and immunohistochemistry for markers of renal maturation. The mean number of S-shaped bodies and glomeruli per section were recorded and statistically analysed for significant differences between all recipient groups and untransplanted metanephroi. The degree of development was scored qualitatively.\nTransplanted E12.5 metanephroi developed S-shaped bodies and glomeruli in all recipient groups, although there were statistically higher numbers of S-shaped bodies in UNX (n = 2) and pregnant recipients (n = 9) than in control recipients (n = 4). Continued development, as indicated by mature vascularized glomeruli, was only observed in those E15.5 metanephroi transplanted into pregnant recipients (n = 11) with a 15.5-fold increase in S-shaped bodies and 4-fold increase in glomeruli compared with control transplants (n = 12).\nWe have successfully established metanephros transplantation in mice and demonstrated enhancement of onward development of E12.5 metanephroi in response to both pregnancy and UNX. Using E15.5 metanephroi, continued development only occurred in pregnant recipients, implying pregnancy provides an environment conducive to continued organogenesis.

To elucidate the relationship between pedicel capacity and fruit growth and to determine the main factor responsible for larger fruit size at harvest, fruit growth and pedicel vascularization after GA application were examined and the carbohydrate fluxes were monitored in a spur unit by non-invasive techniques using 13C tracer. Histological studies of fruit revealed that GA increased the cell size of the mesocarp but not the cell number and core size. The investigation of carbon partitioning showed that an increase in the specific rate of carbohydrate accumulation in fruit or the strength of fruit should be responsible for an increase of fruit weight in GA-treated trees. Observation of pedicel vascularization showed that an increase in pedicel cross-sectional area (CSA) by GA application mainly resulted from phloem and xylem CSA, but it is unlikely that an increase in the transport system is the direct factor for larger fruit size. Therefore, it can be concluded that larger fruit size resulting from GA application during the period of rapid fruit growth caused an increase in the cell size of the mesocarp and increased carbon partitioning to the fruit. Although GA is closely involved with pedicel vascularization, it seems that photosynthate accumulation in fruit is limited by the sink strength of fruit rather than by the transport capacity of the pedicel.", "journal": "Journal of experimental botany", "date": "2005-09-01", "authors": ["CaixiZhang", "KenjiTanabe", "FumioTamura", "KazuhiroMatsumoto", "AkiraYoshida"], "doi": "10.1093/jxb/eri264"}

{"title": "Biologics in the treatment of transplant rejection and ischemia/reperfusion injury: new applications for TNFalpha inhibitors?", "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors have proven efficacy in various autoimmune diseases such as Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Indeed, some TNFalpha inhibitors have already been approved for the management of the inflammatory manifestations associated with Crohn disease and rheumatoid arthritis. These agents are increasingly used for treatment of corticosteroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation, and case reports have documented their efficacy in treating corticosteroid- and muromonab-resistant rejection after intestinal transplantation. Thus, the potential role of TNFalpha inhibitors in transplantation of other vascularized solid organs is worthy of investigation. Experimental evidence indicates that TNFalpha plays a key role in mediating ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury after liver, kidney, intestine, heart, lung, and pancreas transplantation. TNFalpha was also identified as a marker cytokine during organ rejection. Single-center studies evaluating the role of TNFalpha inhibitors in kidney transplantation have been initiated but the results are not yet available. TNFalpha is known to be a contributing factor in kidney allograft rejection, and may have value in predicting the onset of steroid-resistant acute rejection after liver transplantation. Experimental and preliminary clinical data have shown that circulating levels of TNFalpha are increased during cardiac graft rejection, and indicate that TNFalpha plays a role in the pathogenesis of acute cardiac allograft rejection. Anti-TNFalpha therapy was shown to prolong cardiac allograft survival when used alone or in combination with other drugs. TNFalpha genotype has been strongly associated with mortality in humans due to acute cell-mediated heart transplant rejection. In addition, there is evidence for a genetic predisposition toward acute rejection after kidney and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. TNFalpha inhibition has been used successfully as part of an induction therapy for pancreatic islet cell transplantation. Apart from IR injury and acute rejection after lung transplantation, TNFalpha was also found to be involved in the pathoimmunology of obliterative bronchiolitis. In conclusion, a substantial body of experimental evidence and preliminary clinical data suggest that TNFalpha inhibitors may play an important role in solid-organ transplantation, both in the amelioration of IR injury and in the treatment and prevention of acute rejection. Pharmacodynamic monitoring and pharmacogenetic screening may help to identify patients most likely to benefit from TNFalpha blockade.

{"title": "Induction of interleukin-8 preserves the angiogenic response in HIF-1alpha-deficient colon cancer cells.", "abstract": "Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is considered a crucial mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia through its regulation of genes that control angiogenesis. It represents an attractive therapeutic target in colon cancer, one of the few tumor types that shows a clinical response to antiangiogenic therapy. But it is unclear whether inhibition of HIF-1 alone is sufficient to block tumor angiogenesis. In HIF-1alpha knockdown DLD-1 colon cancer cells (DLD-1(HIF-kd)), the hypoxic induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was only partially blocked. Xenografts remained highly vascularized with microvessel densities identical to DLD-1 tumors that had wild-type HIF-1alpha (DLD-1(HIF-wt)). In addition to the preserved expression of VEGF, the proangiogenic cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 was induced by hypoxia in DLD-1(HIF-kd) but not DLD-1(HIF-wt) cells. This induction was mediated by the production of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent activation of NF-kappaB. Furthermore, the KRAS oncogene, which is commonly mutated in colon cancer, enhanced the hypoxic induction of IL-8. A neutralizing antibody to IL-8 substantially inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in DLD-1(HIF-kd) but not DLD-1(HIF-wt) xenografts, verifying the functional significance of this IL-8 response. Thus, compensatory pathways can be activated to preserve the tumor angiogenic response, and strategies that inhibit HIF-1alpha may be most effective when IL-8 is simultaneously targeted.", "journal": "Nature medicine", "date": "2005-08-30", "authors": ["YusukeMizukami", "Won-SeokJo", "Eva-MariaDuerr", "ManishGala", "JingnanLi", "XiaoboZhang", "Michael AZimmer", "OthonIliopoulos", "Lawrence RZukerberg", "YutakaKohgo", "Maureen PLynch", "Bo RRueda", "Daniel CChung"], "doi": "10.1038/nm1294"}
{"title": "The tomato Aux/IAA transcription factor IAA9 is involved in fruit development and leaf morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins are transcriptional regulators that mediate many aspects of plant responses to auxin. While functions of most Aux/IAAs have been defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana, phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations have been scarce and subtle. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. IAA9-inhibited lines have simple leaves instead of wild-type compound leaves, and fruit development is triggered before fertilization, giving rise to parthenocarpy. This indicates that IAA9 is a key mediator of leaf morphogenesis and fruit set. In addition, antisense plants displayed auxin-related growth alterations, including enhanced hypocotyl/stem elongation, increased leaf vascularization, and reduced apical dominance. Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family.", "journal": "The Plant cell", "date": "2005-08-30", "authors": ["HuaWang", "BrianJones", "ZhengguoLi", "PierreFrasse", "CorinneDelalande", "FaridRegad", "SalmaChaabouni", "AlainLatch\u00e9", "Jean-ClaudePech", "MondherBouzayen"], "doi": "10.1105/tpc.105.033415"}
{"title": "[Uterus after irradiation].", "abstract": "Today, the good prognosis of girl's cancers raises the question of her future fertility. Several studies have focused on preservation of ovarian function, but the uterus, irradiated in childhood, is a crucial component to bear in mind because the somatic damages, in terms of endometrial and myometrial atrophy, scar fibrosis and hypovascularization, are negative factors for the establishment and maintenance of a pregnancy and for a convenient labour. Consequences for procreation are related to the morphologic uterine sequelae and its altered function: early miscarriages, abnormal placentation etc. In addition to some spontaneous pregnancies reported in literature, a few pregnancies, for women experiencing a premature iatrogenic ovarian failure due to mild irradiation, have been obtained after in vitro fertilization and oocyte donation with increased estrogen treatment. Recently, a real hope has surged in relation to the opportunity to reverse the radio-induced fibrosis and thus to obtain a better trophic uterus, using the antioxidant pathway. So, a treatment combining pentoxifylline 800 mg/d and tocopherol 1000 IU/d for 12 months allowed improvement of local uterine conditions such as endometrial thickness (x2), myometrial dimensions (x1.5) and uterine vascularization in all six sterile women studied, who have received high irradiation in childhood (>or=45 Gy). Moreover, two women mildly irradiated (#20 Gy) with endometrium resisting to physiological estrogen status, became spontaneously pregnant after using this combined treatment, and gave birth to healthy children.

{"title": "How to explain the differences between renin angiotensin system modulators.", "abstract": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays important roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, renal diseases, cardiac hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Angiotensin II exerts classic hemodynamic and renal effects, but it is also a local biologically active mediator with direct effects on endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Two subtypes of Ang II receptors, type 1 (AT(1)) and type 2 (AT(2)), have been identified. Their roles have been investigated in depth in vivo and in vitro, although few data are available concerning the role of the AT(2) receptors in the adult circulation in humans. The two receptors, both of which belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors, have different signaling pathways and different functions. The AT(1) receptor subtype is expressed ubiquitously and is involved in most of the well-known biological functions of Ang II. The AT(1) receptor transactivates growth pathways and mediates major Ang II effects such as vasoconstriction, increased cardiac contractility, renal tubular sodium reabsorption, cell proliferation, vascular and cardiac hypertrophy, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. In contrast to AT(1), the physiologic role of AT(2) receptors has long remained an enigma. The AT(2) receptors are highly expressed in fetal tissues, although their expression dramatically decreases after birth, being restricted to a few organs, including the cardiovascular system. The AT(2) receptor is re-expressed in the adult animal after cardiac and vascular injury and during wound healing, suggesting a role for this receptor in tissue remodeling, growth, or development. Recent and concordant data suggested that overstimulation of AT(2) receptors might be implied in cardiac and vascular hypertrophic processes. Both Ang II receptors are involved in hypoxia-induced neovascularization. A large set of experimental evidence suggests that activation of the AT(1) receptor results in proangiogenic effects, whereas AT(2) receptors mediate apoptosis and thus antiangiogenic effects. Furthermore, bradykinin through its B(1) or B(2) receptors is a potent activator of experimental hypoxia-induced neovascularization. Thus, pharmacologic blockade of the AT(1) receptor and resulting overactivation of AT(2) receptors could impair or delay neovascularization in ischemic tissues in patients receiving chronic treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers. In contrast, increased tissue bradykinin resulting from inhibition of converting enzyme could help to restore functional vascularization in ischemic tissues. These basic concepts deserve a second reading and reevaluation to discuss differences in vascular protection in large clinical trials with different classes of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system.", "journal": "American journal of hypertension", "date": "2005-08-30", "authors": ["Bernard ILevy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.amjhyper.2005.05.005"}

{"title": "Tissue-specific hemostasis in mice.", "abstract": "Blood coagulation is essential to maintain hemostasis in organisms with a vascular network. Formation of a fibrin-rich clot at a site of vessel injury is a highly complex process that is orchestrated by the coagulation protease cascade. This cascade is regulated by 3 major anticoagulant pathways. Removal of a clot is mediated by the fibrinolytic system. Defects in the regulation of clot formation lead to either hemorrhage or thrombosis. Tissue factor, the primary cellular initiator of blood coagulation, is a transmembrane receptor that is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The 3 major anticoagulants are tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin, and protein C, the latter requiring a transmembrane receptor called thrombomodulin for its activation. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin are expressed by endothelial cells in a tissue-specific manner, whereas antithrombin and protein C circulate in the plasma. Fibrinolysis requires the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, which is mediated by tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Interestingly, tissue-type plasminogen activator is expressed by a subset of endothelial cells of discrete size and location.

{"title": "Myocardial vascular and metabolic adaptations in chronically anemic fetal sheep.", "abstract": "Little is known about the vascular and metabolic adaptations that take place in the fetal heart to maintain cardiac function in response to increased load. Chronic fetal anemia has previously been shown to result in increased ventricular mass, increased myocardial vascularization, and increased myocardial expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We therefore sought to determine whether chronic fetal anemia induces expression of HIF-1-regulated angiogenic factors and glycolytic enzymes in the fetal myocardium. Anemia was produced in chronically instrumented fetal sheep by daily isovolemic hemorrhage (80-100 ml) for either 3 (n = 4) or 7 days (n = 11) beginning at 134 days of gestation (term 145 days). Catheterized, nonbled twins served as controls. Isovolemic hemorrhage over 7 days resulted in decreased fetal hematocrit (37 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 1%) and arterial oxygen content (6.5 +/- 0.4 to 2.8 +/- 0.2 ml O2/dl). Myocardial blood flow and vascularization were significantly increased after 7 days of anemia. Myocardial HIF-1 protein expression and VEGF (left ventricular), VEGF receptor-1 (right ventricular), and VEGF receptor-2 (right ventricular, left ventricular) mRNA levels were elevated (P < 0.05) in 7-day anemic compared with control animals. Myocardial expressions of the glycolytic enzymes aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase A, phosphofructokinase (liver), and phosphoglycerol kinase were also significantly elevated after 7 days of anemia. Despite the absence of a significant increase in myocardial HIF-1alpha protein in 3-day anemic fetuses, expressions of VEGF, VEGF receptor-1, and the glycolytic enzymes were greater in 3-day compared with 7-day anemic animals. These data suggest that HIF-1 likely participates in the fetal myocardial response to anemia by coordinating an increase in gene expressions that promote capillary growth and anaerobic metabolism. However, factors other than HIF-1 also appear important in the regulation of these genes. We speculate that the return of mRNA levels of angiogenic and glycolytic enzymes toward control levels in the 7-day anemic fetus is explained by a significantly increased resting myocardial blood flow, resulting from coronary vascular growth and increased coronary conductance, and a return to a state of adequate oxygen and nutrient delivery, obviating the need for enhanced transcription of genes encoding angiogenic and glycolytic enzymes.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

By six months an almost normal range of motion was achieved in the PIP (10 to 90 degrees ) and DIP (5 to 30 degrees) joints and radiographs showed complete metaplasia of the chondral graft into an ossified phalanx at 20 months follow-up. The joint spaces also remodelled, and this was confirmed with MRI scanning. Reports on partial replacement of diaphysis or epiphyses in the digits are discussed, but the only valid comparison of total phalanx replacement is free toe phalanx grafting. We did not choose this solution in a normal hand because of the length discrepancy between finger and toe phalanges. This case shows that, in this particular paediatric situation, the free non-vascularised transfer of a chondral graft restored excellent function, with remodelling of the phalanx and joint spaces of the finger.", "journal": "Chirurgie de la main", "date": "2005-08-27", "authors": ["ASalon", "JR\u00e9mi", "FBrunelle", "J LDrap\u00e9", "ChGlorion"], "doi": "10.1016/j.main.2005.04.003"}

The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of non-invasive selective fetal reduction using HIFU in a rabbit model.\nA protocol for HIFU-induced tissue coagulation was developed in the rabbit model. The fetal heart was targeted with ultrasound-guided tissue ablation by a HIFU beam. Five time-mated does between 20-29 days' gestation underwent transabdominal fetal cardiac ablation in a total of 11 fetuses. The HIFU system consisted of a 7-MHz high-power transducer, operated at 2000 W/cm2. The fetal heart rate was observed using real-time ultrasound with Doppler flow velocimetry. All lesions were assessed macroscopically and by histological analysis.\nSevere bradycardia leading to asystole was observed in all targeted fetuses with ultrasound examination. Dissection of fetuses demonstrated a necrotic intrathoracic lesion similar in size to the HIFU focus (approximately 1 x 9 mm).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of the foot and ankle after a VFBG using validated functional outcome measures in patients with no preexisting lower limb pathology.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of our health center database and identified 28 patients who underwent free flap transfer for maxillofacial reconstruction. Patients were contacted by phone and mailed functional questionnaire packages. Functional outcome assessments were obtained through the use of the following validated functional outcome instruments: the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Functional Foot Index (FFI), and the lower limb component of the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System (MODEMS). A matched student t-test was used to compare the experimental limb to the appropriate control group.\nThe response rate was 77%. The incidence of wound complications was 23% (five of 22). Two of the five were caused by wound dehiscence, and three were caused by infection. There was an 18% incidence of clawing of the great toe.

The presence of 15dPGJ2 during DMBA and TPA treatment inhibited apoptosis and increased the rate, number, size and vascularization of the papillomas, some of them progressing into carcinomas. Moreover, skin sections from mice treated for one week with DMBA and 15dPGJ2 showed a much reduced rate of apoptotic cells, and an enhanced expression of vascular epithelial growth factor when compared with animals receiving DMBA, with or without PGE2. The analysis of molecular events in the MCA3D keratinocyte cell line showed that 15dPGJ2 activated Ras and improved cell viability by inhibiting DMBA-dependent apoptosis. In addition to this, cell adhesion was impaired in MCA3D keratinocytes co-treated with 15dPGJ2 and DMBA, at the same time when the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was observed under these conditions.

However, detailed information is meager. The present study examined the formation process of the articular cavity in the rat TMJ by immunocytochemistry for CD31, RECA-1, and ED1, which are useful cellular markers for endothelial cells and monocyte/macrophage lineages, respectively. The upper articular cavity formation had begun by embryonic day 21 (E21) and was completed at postnatal day 1 (P1) in advance of the lower cavitation; the latter took place from P1 to P3. The occurrence and distribution pattern of the CD31-, RECA-1-, and ED1-positive cells differed between the upper and lower articular cavity-forming areas: the ED1-positive cells exclusively occurred in the area of the prospective upper articular cavity prior to its formation, while no ED1-positive cell appeared in the lower cavity-forming area. In contrast, the CD31- and RECA-1-positive endothelial cells were restricted to the lower cavity-forming area (never the prospective upper cavity) at E19 and diminished thereafter. Throughout the cavity formation, we failed to find any apoptotic cells in the cavity formation area, indicating no involvement of apoptosis in the cavity formation in TMJ. The present findings on the behaviors of endothelial cells and ED1-positive cells show a possibility of different mechanism in the cavity formation between the upper and lower articular cavities in the rat TMJ.

{"title": "Macrophage migration and gene expression in response to tumor hypoxia.", "abstract": "Monocytes are recruited into tumors from the circulation along defined chemotactic gradients and they then differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Recent evidence has shown that large numbers of TAMs are attracted to and retained in avascular and necrotic areas, where they are exposed to tumor hypoxia. At these sites, TAMs appear to undergo marked phenotypic changes with activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, dramatically upregulating the expression of a large number of genes encoding mitogenic, proangiogenic and prometastatic cytokines and enzymes. As a consequence, high TAMs density has been correlated with increased tumor growth and angiogenesis in various tumor types. Since hypoxia is a hallmark feature of malignant tumors and hypoxic tumor cells are relatively resistant to radio- and chemotherapy, these areas have become a target for novel forms of anticancer therapy. These include hypoxia-targeted gene therapy in which macrophages are armed with therapeutic genes that are activated by hypoxia-responsive promoter elements. This restricts transgene expression to hypoxic areas, where the gene product is then released and acts on neighboring hypoxic tumor cells or proliferating blood vessels. In this way, the responses of macrophages to tumor hypoxia can be exploited to deliver potent antitumor agents to these poorly vascularized, and thus largely inaccessible, areas of tumors.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2005-08-18", "authors": ["CraigMurdoch", "Claire ELewis"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.21422"}

Control rats were similarly injured and then implanted with scaffolds containing the fibrin solution with SCs lentivirally transduced to produce express GFP only or with the fibrin solution only. Transgene production and biological activity in vitro, SC survival within the scaffold in vitro and in vivo, scaffold integration, axonal regeneration and myelination, and hind limb motor function were analyzed at 1, 2, and 6 weeks after implantation. In vitro, lentivirally transduced SCs produced 87.5 ng/24 h/10(6) cells of D15A as measured by neurotrophin-3 activity in ELISA. The secreted D15A was biologically active as evidenced by its promotion of neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture. In vitro, SCs expressing GFP were present in the scaffolds for up to 6 h, the end of a typical surgery session. Implantation of SC-seeded scaffolds caused modest loss of spinal nervous tissue. Reactive astrocytes and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans were present in spinal tissue adjacent to the scaffold. Vascularization of the scaffold was ongoing at 1 week post-implantation.

Using immunohistochemistry, we have investigated the non-neuronal factors that contribute to these properties. Extensive vascularization was observed in FN mats by 1 week along with heavy macrophage infiltration by 3 days post-implantation. By 1 week post-implantation, laminin tubules had formed and were associated with axons and p75 immunoreactive Schwann cells. By 4 weeks post-implantation, most axons were associated with Schwann cell derived myelin. Few oligodendrocytes were present within the mat, even with an increase in the number of oligodendrocyte precursors around the implant site by 7 days post-implantation. Astrocyte proliferation also occurred in the intact tissue, with a prominent glial scar forming around the implant within 4 weeks. However, by 2 months post-implantation astrocytes were present in the FN implant site and were intermingled with the axons. Axonal ingrowth and integration of the FN mats is probably due to the ability of FN mats to support and organize infiltration of Schwann cells and deposition of laminin. At later time points, myelinated axons remain in the implant site, even after other elements (e.g. macrophages and laminin) have disappeared.

{"title": "Inflammation and cancer: when NF-kappaB amalgamates the perilous partnership.", "abstract": "Chronic inflammation has long been suggested to constitute a risk factor for a variety of epithelial cancers such as malignancies of prostate, cervix, esophagus, stomach, liver, colon, pancreas, and bladder. An inflammatory response is typically accompanied by generation of free radicals, stimulation of cytokines, chemokines, growth and angiogenic factors. Free radicals, capable of both directly damaging DNA and affecting the DNA repair machinery, enhance genetic instability of affected cells, thus contributing to the first stage of neoplastic transformation also known as \"initiation\". Cytokines and growth factors can further promote tumor growth by stimulating cell proliferation, adhesion, vascularization, and metastatic potential of later stage tumors. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that are widely believed to trigger both the onset and the resolution of inflammation. NF-kappaB also governs the expression of genes encoding proteins essential in control of stress response, maintenance of intercellular communications, and regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Recent data have expanded the concept of inflammation as a critical component in carcinogenesis suggesting new anti-inflammatory therapies for a complementary approach in treating a variety of tumor types. These observations highlighted the NF-kappaB pathway as an attractive avenue for drug discovery and development.

Nevertheless, the major interest concerns the vital function it plays in early embryo growth and development. Two compartments are recognized in this organ: the yolk sac proper and the vitelline stalk. In this study we report the identification and partial characterization of a glomus-like body in the wall of the secondary YS in humans. A detailed structural description is also presented on the time course of formation of this new structure, at precisely sequential stages between 4-8 wk post-conception. The significance of this new compartment on the YS function is analyzed. Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the microstructure of the YS and the vitelline stalk during the first 8 wk of development. Ten YSs were collected from embryos (aged between 24-50 days) obtained from emergency salpingectomies due to tubal ectopic pregnancy. From 5 wk onward a new structure was observed in the YS located near the apex of the pear-shaped yolk vesicle and closed to the connecting stalk. We designate this differentiation as glomus-like body. This structure is 1-1.5 mm long and merged from a pocket-like structure of the extraembryonic splanchnic mesoderm of the YS wall. It likely represents an area of convergence of the vascular network of the YS wall. Our findings underline the remarkable complexity of the human secondary yolk sac during early development. The detailed description of the microanatomy of this vital organ is of theoretical and practical interest in order to unravel the mechanisms used by the yolk sac to transport nutrients to the embryo.", "journal": "Italian journal of anatomy and embryology = Archivio italiano di anatomia ed embriologia", "date": "2005-08-17", "authors": ["JPereda", "ECorral", "GFranchitto"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Pored domes in adrenocortical capillaries. An ultrastructural study in mammals.", "abstract": "The adrenocortical gland is one of the most vascularized organs of the mammalian body. It undergoes continuous morphological changes dynamically dependent upon special permeability conditions related to various physiological and physiopathological events. The adrenal cortex of different adult mammals (3 pigs, 2 mice, 3 sheep) was studied by means of scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. As seen by SEM it is formed of polyhedral cells which delimit a characteristic continuous labyrinth system of intercellular lacunae occupied by sinusoid-like capillaries. The capillary wall is fenestrated and is lined by flattened endothelial cells with their nuclear part bulging into the capillary lumen. The fenestrae are round or oval pores measuring 50-100 nm in diameter. They are usually clustered to form sieve plates and characteristically present a thin membranous diaphragm. Irregular microelevations and dome-like projections are often seen. These structures are made of thin cytoplasmic plates interrupted by numerous small pores which show a sieve plate profile. The pored-domes on the nuclear portion seem to be identical in structure to those found in the thinner endothelial part; some of them appear to detach from the endothelial cell. The pored-domes are structurally comparable to those reported both in the renal glomerular endothelium and in liver sinusoids. These endothelial structures may be an expression of the high rate of filtration of these tissues and may be also related to the final step of the replacement of the sieve plates during endothelial regeneration.", "journal": "Italian journal of anatomy and embryology = Archivio italiano di anatomia ed embriologia", "date": "2005-08-17", "authors": ["S CUrsu", "UMuglia", "GFamiliari", "CMotta", "SCorrer"], "doi": null}

Diameters of stem (parent, mother) vessels and daughter vessels (branches), interbranching distances and branching angles between stem and daughter vessels lastly define the overall three-dimensional structure of the vascular network as well as the basic transport capacity of the system. Here we use scanning electron microscopy and 3D-morphometry to measure these variables from stereo paired images of vascular corrosion casts of the anterior cerebral artery and its main branches and from arteriolar bifurcations of the mesencephalic optic tectum in the actinopterygian fish, Acipenser ruthenus. We then calculate bifurcation indices, area ratios, asymmetry ratios and test for the optimality principles underlying the bifurcations studied. Our results show that arteriolar bifurcations in the optic tectum are in favor of the principles of minimum pumping power and minimum volume rather than the principles of minimum surface and minimum drag. We conclude that scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts in conjunction with 3D-morphometry is an excellent tool to thoroughly analyze vascular trees in healthy and diseased tissues and organs, as well as on an ontogenetic and phylogenetic scale.", "journal": "Italian journal of anatomy and embryology = Archivio italiano di anatomia ed embriologia", "date": "2005-08-17", "authors": ["ALametschwandtner", "BMinnich", "BSt\u00f6ttinger", "W DKrautgartner"], "doi": null}

Lower extremities of 20 (12 male, eight female; mean age, 51 years; range, 10-84 years) patients undergoing vascularized free-flap procedures were examined at multi-detector row CT angiography. In five patients, legs were assessed as potential fibular free-flap donors for mandibular, maxillary, or radial reconstruction. In 15 patients, legs were assessed as recipient sites for free flaps. Vascular maps obtained with volume rendering, maximum intensity projections, and curved planar reformations were generated, and assessment was made in the depiction of calf vessels and presence of stenosis, occlusion, and anatomic anomaly. Findings of CT angiography, physical examination, and surgery were compared, where applicable, and successful CT-based prediction of the surgical intervention was assessed. Immediate and long-term (>70 days) viability of the graft was assessed in all patients.\nCT angiography depicted the entirety of all four major calf arteries in 29 of 32 legs scanned. In three legs, external-fixation hardware obscured some segments. There were no discrepancies between CT findings and those identified at the time of surgery. Arterial abnormalities, including stenosis, occlusion, and variant anatomy, were seen in 12 lower extremities in 10 patients. Only two were suspected on the basis of physical examination findings.

Here, we show that overexpression of HIF-2alpha in rat glioma tumors enhances angiogenesis but reduces growth of these tumors, in part by increasing tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of HIF-2alpha reduced apoptosis in hypoxic human malignant glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, inhibition of HIF by overexpression of a dominant-negative HIF transgene in glioma cells or HIF-2alpha deficiency in teratomas reduced vascularization but accelerated growth of these tumor types.

COX-2 overexpression is frequently observed in bladder carcinoma and has been correlated with an increased disease stage and with reduced patient survival.\nNS-398 was used to inhibit COX-2 selectively in human T24 bladder carcinoma cells. Lentiviral transduction of the firefly luciferase gene allowed us to assess the effect of NS-398 on orthotopic bladder carcinoma growth over time in a noninvasive manner. Immunohistochemistry on bladder tissue sections was performed to determine the effect of NS-398 treatment on tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and angiogenesis (von Willebrand factor; CD31).\nT24 cells expressed COX-2 and secreted prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Selective COX-2 inhibition using NS-398 abrogated PGE2 secretion and inhibited cell proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting cell viability. In vivo administration of NS-398 reduced the outgrowth of experimental orthotopic T24 bladder carcinoma. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in Ki-67-positive tumor cells but not by a reduction in tumor cell viability or tumor vascularization.\nSelective COX-2 inhibition by NS-398 reduces the outgrowth of T24 human bladder carcinoma in an orthotopic mouse model.

Since the work of Duret in 1874 on vascularization of the brain, many textbooks and atlases have shown schematic drawings of the supply areas of the major cerebral arteries. Recent postmortem studies demonstrated that the variability of the cerebral vascular territories is significantly greater than previously assumed. The aim of the present study was to investigate in vivo, the variability of flow territories of major brain feeding arteries. Flow territory mapping of the anterior (internal carotid arteries) and posterior (basilar artery) circulation was performed in 115 (58 +/- 9 years of age) subjects with selective arterial spin labeling MRI. Flow territory maps for the entire population indicated significant variation in flow territories. However, when the subjects are further categorized into groups with a complete circle of Willis, with a missing A1 segment and with a unilateral or bilateral fetal-type posterior cerebral artery, the results showed considerably lower variation within groups. It is therefore concluded that, the variation observed from the entire population is mainly caused by anatomical variants of the circle of Willis.

{"title": "Computational modeling of multicellular constructs with the material point method.", "abstract": "Computational modeling of the mechanics of cells and multicellular constructs with standard numerical discretization techniques such as the finite element (FE) method is complicated by the complex geometry, material properties and boundary conditions that are associated with such systems. The objectives of this research were to apply the material point method (MPM), a meshless method, to the modeling of vascularized constructs by adapting the algorithm to accurately handle quasi-static, large deformation mechanics, and to apply the modified MPM algorithm to large-scale simulations using a discretization that was obtained directly from volumetric confocal image data. The standard implicit time integration algorithm for MPM was modified to allow the background computational grid to remain fixed with respect to the spatial distribution of material points during the analysis. This algorithm was used to simulate the 3D mechanics of a vascularized scaffold under tension, consisting of growing microvascular fragments embedded in a collagen gel, by discretizing the construct with over 13.6 million material points. Baseline 3D simulations demonstrated that the modified MPM algorithm was both more accurate and more robust than the standard MPM algorithm. Scaling studies demonstrated the ability of the parallel code to scale to 200 processors. Optimal discretization was established for the simulations of the mechanics of vascularized scaffolds by examining stress distributions and reaction forces. Sensitivity studies demonstrated that the reaction force during simulated extension was highly sensitive to the modulus of the microvessels, despite the fact that they comprised only 10.4% of the volume of the total sample. In contrast, the reaction force was relatively insensitive to the effective Poisson's ratio of the entire sample. These results suggest that the MPM simulations could form the basis for estimating the modulus of the embedded microvessels through a parameter estimation scheme. Because of the generality and robustness of the modified MPM algorithm, the relative ease of generating spatial discretizations from volumetric image data, and the ability of the parallel computational implementation to scale to large processor counts, it is anticipated that this modeling approach may be extended to many other applications, including the analysis of other multicellular constructs and investigations of cell mechanics.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2005-08-13", "authors": ["James EGuilkey", "James BHoying", "Jeffrey AWeiss"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.06.017"}
{"title": "Allometric scaling of the maximum metabolic rate of mammals: oxygen transport from the lungs to the heart is a limiting step.", "abstract": "The maximum metabolic rate (MMR) of mammals is approximately proportional to M(0.9), where M is the mammal's body weight. Therefore, MMR increases with body weight faster than does the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is approximately proportional to M(0.7). MMR is strongly associated with the capacity of the cardiovascular system to deliver blood to capillaries in the systemic circulation, but properties of this vascular system have not produced an explanation for the scaling of MMR.\nHere we focus on the pulmonary circulation where resistance to blood flow (impedance) places a limit on the rate that blood can be pumped through the lungs before pulmonary edema occurs. The maximum pressure gradient that does not produce edema determines the maximum rate that blood can flow through the pulmonary veins without compromising the diffusing capacity of oxygen. We show that modeling the pulmonary venous tree as a fractal-like vascular network leads to a scaling equation for maximum cardiac output that predicts MMR as a function of M as well as the conventional power function aM(b) does and that least-squares regression estimates of the equation's slope-determining parameter correspond closely to the value of the parameter calculated directly from Murray's law.\nThe assumption that cardiac output at the MMR is limited by pulmonary capillary pressures that produce edema leads to a model that is in agreement with experimental measurements of MMR scaling, and the rate of blood flow in pulmonary veins may be rate-limiting for the pathway of oxygen.", "journal": "Theoretical biology & medical modelling", "date": "2005-08-13", "authors": ["Page RPainter"], "doi": "10.1186/1742-4682-2-31\n10.1016/j.resp.2004.01.006\n10.1038/417166a\n10.1073/pnas.0436428100\n10.1126/science.276.5309.122\n10.1006/jtbi.2003.3198\n10.1016/0034-5687(81)90077-3\n10.1006/jtbi.1998.0723\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000146785.15995.67\n10.1016/S0894-7317(96)90478-2\n10.1097/00003677-200401000-00006\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.09.037\n10.1016/0029-7844(95)00348-7\n10.1016/0034-5687(84)90018-5"}

Although the three-dimensional organization of the capillaries has been previously investigated, the structural features underlying the formation of the new capillaries remains poorly understood. Thus, in the hope of better understanding the mechanism of formation of the stellate reticulum capillaries, upper first molar tooth germs of newborn and 3-day-old rats were fixed in glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde and processed for light and electron microscopy. Our results showed that blood capillaries are initially in close proximity to the outer enamel epithelium. Between and intercalated with the capillaries are round/ovoid clusters of cells, some of which are vacuolated, closely apposed to the outer enamel epithelium. The outer enamel epithelium is not a continuous layer, but exhibits gaps between the cells. This suggests that the capillaries penetrate the enamel organ through these gaps, since no invagination of the epithelium was observed. The presence of a cluster of cells containing vacuoles suggests that vasculogenesis is taking place. Images showing loss of the basal lamina, proliferation of endothelial cells, presence of filopodia and lateral sprouting suggests that angiogenesis is also occurring. Thus, neoformation of capillaries of the molar enamel organ of rat seems to occur simultaneously by mechanisms of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2005-08-12", "authors": ["EManzke", "EKatchburian", "F PFaria", "EFreym\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10363"}

Pyramidal spastic quadriparesis (3/5) with a sensory level at C5-C6 was found neurologically. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain and spine revealed extradural cord compression at C3-C5 as the sole abnormality.

MMP9 promotes local tumor progression and distant metastasis in mouse models by enhancing extracellular matrix degradation, releasing VEGF from extracellular matrix and promoting vascular pericyte recruitment. Furthermore, increased plasma MMP9 expression levels in human subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) inversely correlates with survival. In contrast, MMP9 can benefit the host by generating inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation such as angiostatin and NC1 domains of collagen IV. To better understand the role of host MMP9 on the primary growth and metastatic potential of NSCLC, we performed an orthotopic model of NSLC in integrin alpha1-null mice (a genetic model for increased MMP9). In these mice we observed decreased number, size and vascularization of primary NSCLC tumors when compared to wild type controls. In addition, decreased number and size of NSCLC-derived metastases were evident in the alpha1-null mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of MMPs in the alpha1-null mice at the time of tumor cell injection resulted in an increase in the number of both primary and metastatic lung cancer as compared to untreated mice, suggesting that primary growth and metastases of NSCLC are worsened by the early inhibition of MMPs.

We identify a series of angiogenesis related genes that are similarly regulated by the two drugs.

The anti-oxidants affect expression of several components of the TNFalpha response pathway including downstream genes that are regulated in the opposite direction in the absence of the inflammatory cytokine. The interference with the TNFalpha pathway is reflected by reduced NFkappaB activation in anti-oxidants treated cells but the compounds are not able to contrast TNFalpha mediated activation of NFkappaB.

{"title": "Significance of vascular stabilization for tumor growth and metastasis.", "abstract": "This mini review highlights the role of vascular stabilization which is apparently mediated by factors belonging to both the pro- and anti-angiogenic group. Knowingly angiopoietin-1 has pro-angiogenic properties while endostatin acts anti-angiogenic. But both factors suppress tumor growth in experimental tumor models. The crossing points of mechanisms of their action are the parameters vascular stabilization and vascular permeability, which are of high importance not only for tumor vascularization, but also for tissue vascularization in general. Both angiopoietin-1 and endostatin reduce the vascular permeability, but promote vascular stabilization. Vascular stabilization is significantly increased under experimental treatment of tumors with angiogenesis inhibitors such as endostatin. It inhibits tumor growth and probably tumor metastasis. The understanding of temporal and spatial sequences of vascular stabilization is an important challenge for scientists working on tumor vascularization and anti-angiogenic tumor therapy.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2005-08-09", "authors": ["SuleymanErgun", "DeryaTilki", "LeticiaOliveira-Ferrer", "GunterSchuch", "NerbilKilic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2005.06.033"}

Vasodilation of vascular networks induces increase in blood volume and blood velocity. Both can be measured by Laser Doppler Velocimetry. We propose in this article a method permitting comparison between experimental and numerical results. Experimental data was obtained by Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Numerical results were obtained by a continuous model of the vascular network. The model consists of three layers. First and last layer are described by anisotropic and heterogeneous porous media. They represent the irrigation and the drainage of the vascular system. The intermediate layer is described by a lumped parameter model that does not permit horizontal fluxes. All vessels are compliant. The permeabilities depend on the volumes of the specific layer. Skin irritation is modeled by a change in compliance of small arterial blood vessels. The comparison between experimental and numerical data is based on the model proposed by Bonner and Nossal [1981. Model for laser Doppler measurements of blood flow. Appl. Opt. 20, 2097-2107]. The model describes the Doppler frequency spectrum S(omega) as a function of the optical phenomena creating the frequency shift. The comparison is based on the model of the first moment M1 approximately integralomegaS(omega)domega. The variables of the first moment can be determined by results of the numerical model. We have shown, that it exists a linear relation between the change in compliance and the following increase in first moment.

Angiosuppressive therapy has now entered the management of progressing cancers, therefore it is clinically important to obtain information on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and microvessel density (MVD) of bone metastasis of BRC.\nVEGF expression and MVD were evaluated in bone metastases of BRC immunohistochemically in paraffin samples of 18 patients and compared to their primary tumors. MVD was determined by using the hot-spot method and the endothelial marker, CD34.\nChemo- and/or endocrine therapy-na\u00efve BRC cases progressed to the bone with a concomitant increase in their angiogenic potential, suggesting that this is the \"natural history\" of BRC progression. On the other hand, this study revealed that vascularization of the bone metastases of BRC patients that had received adjuvant (chemo- and/or endocrine) therapy was significantly decreased compared to the corresponding primary tumors, also supported by a decreased VEGF expression in metastases, both suggesting that the treatment significantly affected the angiogenic phenotype of the progressing disease.\nAngiosuppressive therapy is a new approach to cancer management including BRC and is frequently applied in the advanced stage of disease. Tumors with a prominent angiogenic phenotype (high MVD and VEGF) are primary candidates for such regimes.

Only patients with less than optimal results of the basic color-Doppler examination (grade of vascularization 0-1) were included in the study. The data were then compared with the final histological results.\nAccording to B-mode ultrasonography, all neoplasms were hypoechogenous; 8 showed irregular margins and, of these, 6 were carcinomas. We did not obtain significant data regarding size and echostructure. In 10 cases, we observed the presence of multiple locoregional formations in the lymph nodes. Patients were selected on the basis of unsatisfactory color-Doppler examination results; following injection of the contrast medium, we were able to visualize an increased number of vascular signals in 40 out of 56 patients, compared to the basic examination. This enabled us to better assess the vascular map of the neoplasms, as well as more easily trace the vascular blood flow and perform a better extrapolation of the quantitative and semi-quantitative data. This study demonstrated the importance of the vascular pattern, which is predictive of a malignant lesion when it is high-grade with multiple vascular poles and irregular vascular distribution. Furthermore, certain semi-quantitative parameters proved to be important, particularly the velocity of the systolic peak (SP), the cut-off of which was approximately 25 cm/s. The resistance index (RI) and pulsality index (PI) did not prove significant and showed overlapping values.\nWe observed that the contrast medium was useful in characterizing lesions, of the salivary glands by allowing for a more precise vascular map of the lesions, as well as greater diagnostic accuracy in tracing the vascular blood flow and calculating quantitative and semiquantitative data.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2005-08-06", "authors": ["AdolfoGallipoli", "GiovanniManganella", "ElisabettaDe Lutiodi di Castelguidone", "AngeloMastro", "FrancoIonna", "LucianoPezzullo", "PaoloVallone"], "doi": null}

A 2 x 2-cm full-thickness dermal wound was made on each db/db mouse. Animals were divided into three groups, with eight animals in each group as follows: group I, empty wound; group II, lentiviral PDGF; and group III, lentiviral GFP.

Harvested wounds were assessed for residual epithelial gap, granulation tissue area, PDGF expression, collagen formation (picrosirius red), and angiogenesis (CD31 staining).\nLentiviral vectors were constructed and transfected dermal fibroblasts demonstrated in vitro production of PDGF mRNA as measured by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry for PDGF confirmed successful in vivo transfection of the PDGF gene. At 21 days, reepithelialization and granulation tissue area were similar in all groups. However, there was a statistically significant increase in angiogenesis and substantially thicker, more coherently aligned collagen fibers in the PDGF group compared with controls.\nPDGF lentiviral vectors were successfully transfected into the regenerated dermis in diabetic wounds.

{"title": "Pericranial wrapping of the frontal bone after anterior skull base tumor resection.", "abstract": "Classic craniofacial resection and the subcranial approach are well-established techniques for the removal of tumors involving the anterior skull base. These techniques require frontal craniotomy to allow broad exposure of the anterior cranial fossa, a procedure that may be further complicated by local infection and osteomyelitis or because of a reduction in tissue perfusion and direct communication between the osteotomy and the contaminated nasoethmoidal cavity. The authors present a new method for wrapping of the frontal bone segment with a pericranial flap with the intention of preventing these serious complications.\nBy means of this new approach, the frontonaso-orbital bone segment is removed, the frontal sinus bone is cranialized, and the frontonaso-orbital segment is repositioned in its original anatomical place following tumor extirpation. Wrapping is accomplished by a double-sided covering of the bone segment with the pericranial flap. This vascularized tissue is guided underneath the bony segment to cover the intranasal surface and then is externalized over the entire frontal area. The frontonaso-orbital segment and its overlying pericranial flap are fixed with the prebent titanium plates.\nTo date, the authors have performed 20 subcranial operations for resection of malignant tumors of the anterior skull base using this technique. None of these patients developed bone flap necrosis or osteomyelitis following radiotherapy. In the authors' hands, the rate of osteoradionecrosis was significantly lower in patients undergoing malignant subcranial tumor resection with pericranial wrapping than in those operated on before the study was activated (0 percent versus 20 percent, respectively; p = 0.056).\nPericranial wrapping is suitable for patients undergoing extirpation of anterior skull base tumors and for whom perioperative radiotherapy is recommended and for patients who have undergone multiple surgical procedures.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2005-08-05", "authors": ["ZivGil", "Dan MFliss"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000172761.65844.d0"}

We further addressed the biological function of VEGF-D for induction of lymphatic metastasis in a nude mouse xenograft model using two human ductal pancreatic cancer cell lines with overexpression of VEGF-D. Compared to normal human pancreas, pancreatic cancer tissue showed overexpression of VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 in conjunction with a high lymphatic vascularization as determined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Tumors derived from VEGF-D-overexpressing cells had a higher microvessel density compared to their mock-controls, as determined based on CD31 immunohistochemistry. Importantly, these tumors also revealed a significant induction of intra- and peritumoral lymphatics, as judged from immunohistochemical detection of LYVE-1 expression. This was associated with a significant increase in lymphatic vessel invasion by tumor cells and an increased rate of lymphatic metastases, as indicated by pan-cytokeratin reactive cells in lymph nodes.

Recent experimental data suggests that ACE inhibitors and AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists have beneficial effects on tumor progression, vascularization and metastasis, and that the AngII type 2 receptor (AT2R) subtype has a potential role in cancer.

However, few basic studies have addressed problems such as the union of bone segments after osteotomy, the effects of dental implant placement on blood flow, and bone formation at the bone:implant interface in grafted bone. Nine adult beagle dogs were divided into three groups of three dogs each. Each group received osteotomized vascularized tibial grafts, osteotomized tibial grafts with implants (implants placed in contralateral limbs as control), or simple (non-vascularized) tibial grafts. The development of bone around the implants was studied by histological examination, contact micro-radiography (CMR), and fluorescent bone labeling. In the dogs receiving osteotomized vascularized tibial grafts, bone bridging was confirmed at both the medial and distal junctions of the bone segments after 4 weeks. Additional newly formed bone was observed after 8 weeks, and bone union at the surface of the segments was completed after 12 weeks. In contrast, bone formation was clearly delayed in dogs receiving simple (non-vascularized) tibial grafts. Histologically, no difference in bone union was evident between limbs with dental implants in tibial bone and control limbs without implants, suggesting that implant placement does not negatively affect revascularization. Fluorescent bone labeling technique confirmed high vascularity of the vascularized tibial bone grafts but not of the simple (non-vascularized) tibial bone grafts early after the procedure.

Some of the mentioned perforators vascularize both the internal capsule and basal nuclei, while some of them also perfuse the adjacent brain structures. Dorsal part of the anterior limb, knee and posterior limb of the internal capsule are commonly supplied by lateral MCA perforators. The intermediate part of the anterior limb is perfused by medial MCA perforators, while its ventral part is nourished by ACA perforators and Heubner's artery. The intermediate part of the knee is supplied by medial MCA perforators, while its ventral part is mostly vascularized by ICA and proximal AChA perforators. The intermediate part of the posterior limb is perfused by medial MCA perforators anteriorly and the proximal AChA perforators posteriorly. The ventral part is supplied by AChA perforators. The retrolenticular and sublenticular portions of the internal capsule are mainly nourished by distal AChA perforators. The caudate nucleus is supplied by perforators of the ACA, MCA and AChA, as well as by branches of the lateral posterior choroidal artery. Most of the putamen is vascularized by MCA perforators, and smaller parts by ACA and AChA perforators.

Antimetabolites were applied peroperatively in 28/45 eyes (62.2%) with a history of previous filtering surgery (12/28 eyes) and/or advanced glaucomatous damage (22/28 eyes). Antimetabolites were not used in the 17/45 other eyes with lower surgical risk factors and higher target IOP, surgical procedure was not augmented with antimetabolites. Postoperative management included laser suture lysis, withdrawal of adjustable sutures and 5-FU injections when needed.

{"title": "Tumor transition zone: a putative new morphological and functional hallmark of tumor aggressiveness.", "abstract": "A small primary or secondary tumor load can occasionally induce more deleterious effects than a histologically identical larger one. In the four murine models studied herein this enhanced tumor aggressiveness could not be attributed to NRAS mutations or other hereditary changes, differential vascularization of live tumor tissues, or necrosis content. Instead, the main tumor feature associated with a more aggressive behavior was the presence of a high number of vessels, sometimes filled with inflammatory cells, inside a tumor area, which we have identified and designated as the transition zone between the live and the necrotic zones. Our experiments suggest that during tumor growth, different cachectic factors are produced within the transition and necrotic zones by dying tumor cells and by tumor infiltrating macrophages only reaching the general circulation through the vessels present in the transition zone. Therefore, a small tumor displaying high vascularization of its transition area could be harmful to its host, while, in contrast, a large tumor could behave as a relatively benign one if its transition zone exhibited little or no vascularization, and in consequence its cachectic factors remained \"trapped.\" Similar histological images to those observed in mice were seen in a significant percentage of human cancer biopsies, raising the possibility that such images might have a prognostic value.", "journal": "Oncology research", "date": "2005-07-30", "authors": ["Oscar DBustuoabad", "Ra\u00fal ARuggiero", "Pedrodi Gianni", "M GabrielaLombardi", "CarolinaBelli", "Gabriela VCamerano", "GracielaDran", "CarolinaSchere-Levy", "H\u00e9ctorCosta", "Martin AIsturiz", "MarinaNarvaitz", "Nicovan Rooijen", "Victoria de los ABustuoabad", "Roberto PMeiss"], "doi": "10.3727/096504005776367933"}
{"title": "Possible use of adaptation to hypoxia in Alzheimer's disease: a hypothesis.", "abstract": "Disorders in memory and other cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from an exhaustion of adaptive reserves in the brain. Therefore it is a challenge to find methods to increase the adaptive reserve of the organism to combat AD. Excitotoxicity, Ca2+ homeostasis disruptions, oxidative stress, disturbed synthesis of NO, and impaired cerebral circulation are suggested as key pathogenic factors of AD. At present it appears that stimulation of the self-defense systems in neural cells is a promising strategy in restricting the progression of AD. These systems include those of antioxidants, heat shock proteins (HSPs), NO, and other so-called stress-limiting systems. Non-drug activation of these systems can be achieved most efficiently by adaptation of the organism to environmental challenges, such as hypoxia. In this paper the potential of methods used in adaptive medicine is explored. The protective mechanisms of adaptation to hypoxia may be related to restriction of oxidative stress in the hippocampus, the limitation of a decrease in NO production induced by beta-amyloid, and increased density of the vascular network in the brain. In this review we selectively present data that support the idea that adaptation to hypoxia is a possible non-drug means in the prevention of AD.

Fifty two patients with low back pain without disc herniation underwent MRI and discography successively.

However, some B16-F10.P1 lung metastases were resistant to infiltration by the A-NK cells and also resistant to the A-NK cell treatment. The infiltration-resistant (I-R) B16-F10.P1 metastases had a unique \"compact\" morphology compared to the \"loose\" morphology of the infiltration-permissive (I-P) metastases. Here, we show that I-P loose tumors and I-R compact tumors are also found in lung metastases of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL), MCA-102 sarcoma, and MC38 colon carcinoma as well as rat MADB106 mammary carcinoma origin. Furthermore, the infiltration resistance of the compact tumors is not restricted to A-NK cells, since PHA and IL-2 stimulated CD8+ T-cells (T-LAK cells) also infiltrated the compact tumors poorly. Analyses of tumors for extracellular matrix (ECM) components and PECAM-1(+) vasculature, revealed that the I-R lesions are hypovascularized and contain very little laminin, collagen and fibronectin. In contrast, the I-P loose tumors are well-vascularized and they contain high amounts of ECM components. Interestingly, the distribution pattern of ECM components in the I-P loose tumors is almost identical to that of the normal lung tissue, indicating that these tumors develop around the alveolar walls which provide the loose tumors with both a supporting tissue and a rich blood supply. In conclusion, tumor infiltration by activated NK and T cells correlates with the presence of ECM components and PECAM-1(+) vasculature in the malignant tissue.

{"title": "Expression and regulation of murine macrophage angiopoietin-2.", "abstract": "Our understanding of angiogenesis has increased significantly in the past few years with the discovery of angiopoietins (Ang). Specifically, Ang2 has been associated with pathologic as well as normal vascularization. While previous studies have shown that a major source of Ang2 has been endothelial cells and tumor cells, we reasoned that macrophages would also have the ability to express angiopoietins, specifically Ang2, due to that cell's role in wound healing, tumor angiogenesis, and a number of non-oncological diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. In this study, murine macrophages constitutively expressed both transcripts and protein for Ang2 but not Ang1 or Ang3. The secretion of Ang2 was enhanced by treatment with lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, prostaglandin E2 and other cyclic AMP-elevating agents, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) played a major role in this enhancement since the PKA inhibitor, H89, blocked secretion of Ang2. Since stimulation of the PKA pathway can lead to macrophage production of VEGF, it is possible that enhancement of Ang2 production by macrophages may be due to autocrine responsiveness to VEGF. Adding anti-VEGF antibodies to the supernatants of stimulated macrophages blocked secretion of Ang2. This study is the first to show murine macrophage production of Ang2 and to provide evidence that it can be regulated. Understanding the regulation of macrophage Ang2 production is especially important in an effort to target the pathologic role of macrophages while preserving their role in immunity and homeostasis.", "journal": "Cellular immunology", "date": "2005-07-28", "authors": ["Neil EHubbard", "DeboraLim", "MithiaMukutmoni", "AnnCai", "Kent LErickson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellimm.2005.06.001"}

Tumor sections were stained for: endothelial cells with CD31 and PAS or hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF).\nMost tumors <35 mm3 were white but tumors >35 mm3 were pink and had a vascularized capsule. The cortex within 100 microns of the capsule had little vascularization. Blood vessels, capillaries, and endothelial pseudopods were found at >100 microns from the capsule (subcortex). Tumors >35 mm3 treated with IR 24 hours previously or with TEMF had decreased blood vessels in the subcortex and more endothelial pseudopods projecting into hypoxic, HIF positive areas than tumors from the control group. Mice that received either IR or TEMF had significantly fewer lung metastatic sites and slower tumor growth than did untreated mice.

{"title": "Glioma cells under hypoxic conditions block the brain microvascular endothelial cell death induced by serum starvation.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is one of essential components for the growth of neoplasms, including malignant gliomas. However, tumor vascularization is often poorly organized and marginally functional due to tumor structural abnormalities, inducing regional or temporal hypoxic conditions and nutritional shortages in tumor tissues. We investigated how during angiogenesis migrating endothelial cells survive in these hypoxic and reduced nutritional conditions. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) underwent apoptosis and necrosis after serum withdrawal. This endothelial cell death was blocked by recombinant VEGF protein or the culture medium of U251 glioma cells exposed to hypoxia (H-CM). Hypoxic treatment increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) expression in U251 glioma cells. H-CM activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) protein and increased the gene expression of antiapoptotic factors including Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), survivin and X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in endothelial cells. The survival activity of H-CM for endothelial cells was abolished by two kinds of VEGF inhibitors {Cyclopeptidic VEGF inhibitor and a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (4-[(4'-chloro-2'-fluoro) phenylamino]-6, 7-dimethoxyquinazoline)} or NFkappaB inhibitors (ALLN and BAY 11-7082). These VEGF inhibitors did not block the activation of NFkappaB induced by H-CM in endothelial cells. On the contrary, TNF-alpha antagonist WP9QY enhanced the survival activity of H-CM for endothelial cells and blocked NFkappaB activation induced by H-CM under serum-starved conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that both the secretion of VEGF from glioma cells and activation of NFkappaB in endothelial cells induced by TNF-alpha are necessary for endothelial cell survival as they increase the expression of antiapoptotic genes in endothelial cells under conditions of serum starvation. These pathways may be one of the mechanisms by which angiogenesis is maintained in glioma tissues.", "journal": "Journal of neurochemistry", "date": "2005-07-27", "authors": ["YoshifumiUeda", "TakaoNakagawa", "ToshihikoKubota", "KazunoriIdo", "KazufumiSato"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03343.x"}

A 2-centimeter section of vascularized small bowel was spliced away from the gut without disruption of the mesenteric attachments. We introduced OVA directly into the lumen of the loop prior to footpad immunization. By excising segments of bowel that contain PPs in some mice and segments without patches in others, we could study the necessity of the M cell and the underlying patch versus epithelial cells in induction of mucosal tolerance. We show that OVA-specific T cell proliferation and serum antibody responses are reduced in mice that have previously been given OVA both in PP-containing loops and in loops without patches. Furthermore, both high- and low-dose tolerance could be induced in the absence of PPs. Low-dose tolerance is associated with bystander suppression and requires IL-10, which indicates active suppression and the induction of regulatory cells. These data suggest that there is a critical role for components of the mucosal immune system other than PPs in antigen sampling and induction of oral tolerance.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2005-07-26", "authors": ["Thomas AKraus", "JensBrimnes", "ChristineMuong", "Jian-HuaLiu", "Thomas MMoran", "Kelly ATappenden", "PeterBoros", "LloydMayer"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI19102"}

Each ovarian follicle is described through a 2D density function giving an age and maturity-structured description of its cell population. The control intervenes in the velocity, gain and loss terms of the conservation law ruling the changes in the density. The model accounts for the changes in the total cell number, growth fraction and global maturity of both ovulatory and degenerating follicles for various intensities of the selection rate.

In this model, the skin component of the hindlimb was stripped away to the ankle level, and the remaining part along with the vascularized epigastric skin was transplanted heterotopically to the inguinal space of the recipient. No osteotomy and intramedullary fixation were performed. Thirty heterotopic and orthotopic hindlimb transplantations were performed in two groups. Each group involved 15 transplantations from inbred, male Brown Norway (BN; RT1n) weighing 150-200 g to Lewis rats (LEW; RT1(1)) weighing 250-300 g. The animals were followed up for 2 weeks under immunosuppression with cyclosporine A (16 mg/kg/day). Mean operation times for heterotopic and orthotopic hindlimb transplantations were 60 and 105 min, with ischemia times of 35 and 85 min, respectively. No animal deaths or major complications were encountered in heterotopic hindlimb transplantation during the follow-up period. Seroma formation was observed in one animal as the only minor complication. The mortality rate for orthotopic hindlimb transplantation was 26.7%, and there were minor complications in 35%, including infection, ulceration, and loss of rigid fixation. This model circumvents the disadvantages of osteotomy and intramedullary fixation, which may increase the risk of blood loss, embolus, and infection in immunosuppressed animals. It also helps avoid tension or kinking on the anastomosis due to inadequate judgment of the osteotomy level, distortion associated with loss of rigid fixation, and weight mismatch between donor and recipient.

The length of the transferred phalanx averaged 75% of the contralateral comparable toe phalanx and 44% of the contralateral digit proximal phalanx. Most patients had good or simple use of the hand with active joint motion. There was universal shortening of the donor toe with hypoplasia of the middle and distal phalanges.

Thirty SD rats without kidney resection were divided into 6 equal groups and underwent allografting embryonic metanephroi in the same manner as mentioned above. The E15 metanephroi of Lewis rats were allografted into the omenta of Thirty adult Brown Norway (BN) rats with one kidney resected. Were divided into 6 equal groups, received allografting of embryonic metanephroi, and injected with CsA of normal saline in the manner as mentioned above (E15CsABN and E15BN).

In conjunction with the tight junctions restricting the paracellular pathway, polarized specific transport systems in the choroidal epithelium allow a fine regulation of CSF-borne biologically active mediators. The highly vascularized stroma delimited by the choroidal epithelium can be a reservoir for retrovirus-infected or activated immune cells. In this work, new insight in the implication of the blood-CSF barrier in neuroinfectious and inflammatory diseases is provided by using a differentiated cellular model of the choroidal epithelium, exposed to infected T lymphocytes. We demonstrate that T cells activated by a retroviral infection, but not non-infected cells, reduce the transporter-mediated CSF-to-blood efflux of organic anions, in particular that of the potent pro-inflammatory prostaglandin PGE2, via the release of soluble factors. A moderate alteration of the paracellular permeability also occurs. We identified the viral protein Tax, oxygenated free radicals, matrix-metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines as active molecules released during the exposure of the epithelium to infected T cells. Among them, tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 1 are directly involved in the mechanism underlying the decrease in some choroidal organic anion efflux. Given the strong involvement of CSF-borne PGE2 in sickness behaviour syndrome, these data suggest that the blood-CSF barrier plays an important role in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammation and neuroinfection, via changes in the transport processes controlling the CSF biodisposition of PGE2.", "journal": "Journal of neurochemistry", "date": "2005-07-20", "authors": ["Seng ThuonKhuth", "NathalieStrazielle", "PascaleGiraudon", "Marie-Fran\u00e7oiseBelin", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisGhersi-Egea"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03309.x"}

We initially identified TGH as a yeast two-hybrid system interactor of the transcription initiation factor TATA-box binding protein 2. TGH has apparent orthologs in all eukaryotic model organisms with the exception of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TGH contains domains with strong similarity to G-patch and SWAP domains, protein domains that are characteristic of RNA binding and processing proteins. Furthermore, TGH colocalizes with the splicing regulator SRp34 to subnuclear particles. We therefore propose that TGH plays a role in RNA binding or processing. Arabidopsis tgh mutants display developmental defects, including reduced plant height, polycotyly, and reduced vascularization. We found TGH expression to be increased in the amp1-1 mutant, which is similar to tgh mutants with respect to polycotyly and defects in vascular development.

Such strategies include a focus on dedicated training time, the use of simulators, and a move towards progression based on satisfactory completion of a defined curriculum and competency assessment rather than the amount of time served. With insufficient time to train in every aspect of general surgery, a move towards fragmentation into its sub-specialty components seems unavoidable.

The aim of this study was to characterise the histomorphometry of terminal villi in shared and non-shared cotyledons in monochorionic placentae, both from uncomplicated twins and from those with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or discordant growth restriction (DeltaIUGR).\nForty-one monochorionic placentae from Caucasian non-smokers were obtained at caesarean section. Their vascular anatomy and placental territories were ascertained by dye injection. After fixation, full thickness histological blocks were obtained by systematic random sampling from each twin's territory and the shared cotyledons. Fifty randomly selected terminal villi were assessed for: (i) median villus diameter (ii) median villus capillary diameter (iii) median fetomaternal diffusion distance (iv) median no. of capillaries/villus (v) degree of vascularization (median percentage cross-sectional area of terminal villi occupied by capillaries) using a stage micrometer and image analysis programme. The histomorphometric findings were then correlated with birthweight discordance, placental territory discordance and DeltaAVAs (no. of AVAs from smaller twin (donor) to larger twin (recipient) minus no. of AVAs from larger to smaller twin).\nHistomorphometric variables were similar in shared and non-shared cotyledons of uncomplicated MCDA twins. However, the median diameter of terminal villi in shared cotyledons in DeltaIUGR and TTTS placentae was significantly smaller [51.2 microm (48.2-58.3), p<0.001 and 52.6 microm (53.1-50.4), p<0.001], and had a similar number of smaller capillaries, larger fetomaternal diffusion distance and reduced vascularization compared to non-shared IUGR and TTTS placentae. However, Deltadiameter (defined as the difference between median diameters of terminal villi in large minus small twins' territories) rose with increasing birthweight discordance (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.82, p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that Deltadiameter was influenced by placental territory discordance (p<0.001) and birthweight discordance (p<0.01): log10 Deltadiameter=1.38+(0.01 x birthweight discordance)+(0.56 x log10 placental territory discordance) (R2=0.82, p<0.001), but there was no significant relationship with DeltaAVA and AAA. In the TTTS group, Deltadiameter correlated significantly with DeltaAVA only: log10Deltadiameter=1.44+(0.02 x DeltaAVA) (R2=0.3, p<0.001).\nThis is the first study to characterise the histomorphometry of shared and non-shared cotyledons in MC twins.

The bioreactor generates new, ectopic host bone with the capability of vascularized tissue transfer. More importantly, bone is reproducibly formed in a closed and malleable environment. In a rat model, the superficial inferior epigastric vessels were isolated, ligated, and then threaded through a prefabricated coral cylinder (hydroxyapatite, ProOsteon 500). Experimental groups were characterized by the following variables: (1) with/without incorporation of vascular pedicle; (2) with/without addition of BMP-2 (0.02 mg/cm3). Scaffolds were harvested 6 weeks after implantation, embedded and sectioned. Tissue samples were decalcified, fixed, and stained with H&E, trichrome green, and CD31/PECAM-1 (a marker of endothelial cells). Vascularized coral scaffolds supplemented with BMP-2 presumably recruited circulating mesenchymal stem cells to generate bone. Bone formation was quantified through histological analysis, and reported as a percentage, area bone/area cross section scaffold x 100. Mean bone formation was 11.30%+/-1.19. All scaffolds supplied by the vascular pedicle, regardless of BMP-2 supplementation, demonstrated neo-vascular ingrowth. Scaffolds lacking a pedicle showed no evidence of vascular ingrowth or bone formation.

{"title": "'Smart' delivery systems for biomolecular therapeutics.", "abstract": "There is a strong need for drug delivery systems that can deliver biological signals from biomaterials and tissue engineering scaffolds, and a particular need for new delivery systems that can efficiently deliver biomolecules to intracellular targets. Viruses and pathogens have evolved potent molecular machinery that sense the lowered pH gradient of the endosomal compartment and become activated to destabilize the endosomal membrane, thereby enhancing protein or DNA transport to the cytoplasmic compartment. A key feature of many of these biological delivery systems is that they are reversible, so that the delivery systems are not directly toxic. These delivery systems have the ability to change their structural and functional properties and thus display remarkable 'smart' material properties. The objective of this presentation is to review the initial development of smart polymeric carriers that mimic these biological delivery systems and combine similar pH-sensitive, membrane-destabilizing activity for the delivery of therapeutic biomolecules.\nWe have developed new 'smart' polymeric carriers to more effectively deliver and broaden the available types of biomolecular therapeutics. The polymers are hydrophilic and stealth-like at physiological pH, but become membrane-destabilizing after uptake into the endosomal compartment where they enhance the release of therapeutic cargo into the cytoplasm. They can be designed to provide a range of pH profiles and membrane-destabilizing activities, allowing their molecular properties to be matched to specific drugs and loading ranges. A versatile set of linker chemistries is available to provide degradable conjugation sites for proteins, nucleic acids, and/or targeting moieties.\nThe physical properties of several pH-responsive polymers were examined. The activity and pH profile can be manipulated by controlling the length of hydrophobic alkyl segments. The delivery of poly(propyl acrylic acid) (PPAA)-containing lipoplexes significantly enhanced wound healing through the interconnected effects of altered extracellular matrix organization and greater vascularization. PPAA has also been shown to enhance cytoplasmic delivery of a model protein therapeutic. Polymeric carriers displaying pH-sensitive, membrane-destabilizing activity were also examined. The pH profile is controlled by the choice of the alkylacrylic acid monomer and by the ratio of the carboxylate-containing alkylacrylic acid monomer to alkylacrylate monomer. The membrane destabilizing activity is controlled by the lengths of the alkyl segment on the alkylacrylic acid monomer and the alkylacrylate monomer, as well as by their ratio in the final polymer chains.\nThe molecular mechanisms that proteins use to sense and destabilize provide interesting paradigms for the development of new polymeric delivery systems that mimic biological strategies for promoting the intracellular delivery of biomolecular drugs. The key feature of these polymers is their ability to directly enhance the intracellular delivery of proteins and DNA, by destabilizing biological membranes in response to vesicular compartment pH changes. The ability to deliver a wide variety of protein and nucleic acid drugs to intracellular compartments from tissue engineering and regenerative scaffolds could greatly enhance control of important processes such as inflammation, angiogenesis, and biomineralization.", "journal": "Orthodontics & craniofacial research", "date": "2005-07-19", "authors": ["P SStayton", "M E HEl-Sayed", "NMurthy", "VBulmus", "CLackey", "CCheung", "A SHoffman"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1601-6343.2005.00336.x"}
{"title": "Targeting of antioxidant and anti-thrombotic drugs to endothelial cell adhesion molecules.", "abstract": "The endothelium represents an important therapeutic target for containment of oxidative stress, thrombosis and inflammation involved in a plethora of acute and chronic conditions including cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and diabetes. However, rapid blood clearance and lack of affinity to the endothelium compromise delivery to target and restrict medical utility of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., catalase) and fibrinolytics. The use of \"stealth\" PEG-liposomes prolongs circulation, whereas conjugation with antibodies to endothelial determinants permits targeting. Constitutive endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM, such as ICAM-1 and PECAM-1, which are stably expressed and functionally involved in oxidative stress and thrombosis) are candidate determinants for targeting of antioxidants and fibrinolytics. CAM antibodies and compounds conjugated with anti-CAM bind to endothelial cells and accumulate in vascularized organs (preferentially, lungs). Pathological stimuli enhance ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells and facilitate targeting, whereas PECAM-1 expression and targeting are stable. Endothelial cells internalize 100-300 nm diameter conjugates possessing multiple copies of anti-CAM, but not monomolecular antibodies or micron conjugates. This permits size-controlled sub-cellular targeting of antioxidants into the endothelial interior and fibrinolytics to the endothelial surface. Targeting catalase to PECAM-1 or ICAM-1 protects endothelial cells against injury by oxidants in culture and alleviates vascular oxidative stress in lungs in animals. Anti-CAM/catalase conjugates are active for a few hours prior to lysosomal degradation, which can be delayed by auxiliary drugs. Conjugation of fibrinolytics to monovalent anti-ICAM permits targeting and prolonged retention on the endothelial surface. Therefore, CAM targeting of antioxidants and fibrinolytics might help to contain oxidative and thrombotic stresses, with benefits of blocking CAM.

{"title": "Maternal nutrient restriction and the fetal left ventricle: decreased angiotensin receptor expression.", "abstract": "Adequate maternal nutrition during gestation is requisite for fetal nutrition and development. While a large group of epidemiological studies indicate poor fetal nutrition increases heart disease risk and mortality in later life, little work has focused on the effects of impaired maternal nutrition on fetal heart development. We have previously shown that 50% global nutrient restriction from 28-78 days of gestation (early to mid-pregnancy; term = 147 days) in sheep at mid-gestation retards fetal growth while protecting growth of heart and results in hypertensive male offspring at nine months of age. In the present study, we evaluate LV gene transcription using RNA protection assay and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression using western blot, of VEGF and AT1 and AT2 receptors for AngII at mid-gestation in fetuses from pregnant ewes fed either 100% (C) or 50% (NR) diet during early to mid-gestation.\nNo difference between the NR (n = 6) and C (n = 6) groups was found in gene transcription of the AngII receptors. Immunoreactive AT1 (1918.4 +/- 154.2 vs. 3881.2 +/- 494.9; P < 0.01) and AT2 (1729.9 +/- 293.6 vs. 3043.3 +/- 373.2; P < 0.02) was decreased in the LV of NR fetuses compared to C fetuses. The LV of fetuses exposed to NR had greater transcription of mRNA for VEGF (5.42 +/- 0.85 vs. 3.05 +/- 0.19; P < 0.03) than respective C LV, while no change was observed in immunoreactive VEGF.\nThe present study demonstrates that VEGF, AT1 and AT2 message and protein are not tightly coupled, pointing to post-transcriptional control points in the mid gestation NR fetus. The present data also suggest that the role of VEGF and the renin-angiotensin system receptors during conditions inducing protected cardiac growth is distinct from the role these proteins may play in normal fetal cardiac growth. The present findings may help explain epidemiological studies that indicate fetuses with low birth weight carry an increased risk of mortality from coronary and cardiovascular disease, particularly if these individuals have reduced cardiovascular reserve due to an epigenetic decrease in vascularization.", "journal": "Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E", "date": "2005-07-16", "authors": ["Jeffrey SGilbert", "Alvin LLang", "Mark JNijland"], "doi": "10.1186/1477-7827-3-27\n10.1530/ror.0.0020105\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.617ad.x\n10.1095/biolreprod.102.012120\n10.1113/jphysiol.2004.061697\n10.1186/1477-7827-1-6\n10.1095/biolreprod.104.029645\n10.1113/jphysiol.2005.084202\n10.1113/jphysiol.2004.078139\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0561a.x\n10.1113/eph8602075\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.038778\n10.1007/s001090050182\n10.1210/er.18.1.4\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000138688.78906.6b\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00843-X\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.032565\n10.1016/S1071-5576(99)00016-7\n10.1002/ar.a.10110\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000128531.39964.c0\n10.1159/000045121\n10.1210/en.142.7.2854\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0162\n10.1210/en.138.2.725\n10.1074/jbc.M407261200\n10.1016/S1043-2760(03)00111-5\n10.1074/jbc.273.37.24037\n10.1136/heart.84.6.595\n10.1074/jbc.270.34.20225\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000159192.93968.8f\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.045278\n10.1006/jmcc.1995.0135\n10.1023/A:1006887510678\n10.1210/er.13.1.18\n10.1002/jcp.20002\n10.1074/jbc.M105293200"}

Recent studies have shown that they are widely expressed outside the nervous system and that they may play important roles in cancers. Several of the genes encoding these proteins are localized on chromosomal region associated with frequent loss-of-heterozygosity in tumors and cancer cell lines and there is also significant hypermethylation of their promoter suggesting that they may act as tumor suppressors. In addition, proteins in all these families and their receptors appear to control the vascularization of the tumors.

{"title": "Experiences with microsurgical tissue transfers in elderly patients.", "abstract": "The combination of advances in microsurgery and the improvement of anesthetic management with increased understanding of the physiology of preoperative and postoperative care has significantly raised the upper age limit for free-flap transfer in elderly patients. Despite pessimistic opinions regarding elderly patients who have poor recovery potential and decreased physiological reserves, the unique feature of free-tissue transfer is that it allows the transfer of well-vascularized tissue to defects in a single-stage procedure, and leads to improved quality of life. In this report, a retrospective analysis of 55 patients aged 50 and older who underwent microsurgical tissue transfer is presented. Hospital and our own records were used to review various parameters. The preoperative medical status of each patient was assessed using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification of Physical Status. Each patient's preoperative medical records, age, sex, transferred tissue type, and length of operation were outlined. Postoperative recorded parameters were the fate of flaps and the short-term postoperative outcome, including surgical complications, medical morbidity, and death within 30 days of surgery. Fifty-eight microvascular tissue transfers were performed in 55 consecutive patients. The study comprised 38 male and 17 female patients, with a mean age of 64.8 years. ASA classification status was class 1 for 15 patients, class 2 for 26 patients, and class 3 for 14 patients. Twenty-five flaps were used for lower extremity reconstruction, 32 flaps were used for head and neck reconstruction, and 1 was used for breast reconstruction. The average operative time was 5.7 h, ranging between 2-13 h. There were 14 major medical complications, resulting in an overall medical complication rate of 25%. There were 3 deaths within 30 days postoperatively. Thus, the overall surgical mortality rate was 5.4%. The longer operation times were associated with the development of postoperative total medical and surgical complications (P = 0.008). While the relationship between ASA class and medical complications was significant (P = 0.0007), no significant relation was determined between ASA class and surgical complications (P = 0.66). It was revealed that the greater the age group, the greater the occurrence of postoperative medical complications (P = 0.0001). The relationship between postoperative surgical complications and age groups was not significant (P = 0.07). It was also demonstrated that the advanced age of patients was associated with a higher ASA class (P = 0.0017). Eleven flaps required reoperation for vascular compromise. While 10 of these were salvaged with vascular anastomosis revisions, one flap was lost. Thus the overall flap success rate was 98.3%. In conclusion, if a patient's medical problems do not constitute a handicap, age itself should not be considered a barrier to free-flap transfer. It is important to be familiar with preoperative medical problems and possible postoperative medical complications in order to achieve a successful outcome. Contrary to what is generally suggested, surgical complications do not constitute a special consideration in older patients.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2005-07-14", "authors": ["OmerOzkan", "H EgeOzgentas", "KemalIslamoglu", "NevalBoztug", "ZekiyeBigat", "M BahadirDikici"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.20136"}

Given the increased use of radiation therapy and combined chemotherapy-radiation therapy regimens in treatment of head and neck malignancies, it is anticipated that osteoradionecrosis will continue to be an important clinical problem. Recently, new concepts have been introduced regarding the pathogenesis of osteoradionecrosis, and these ideas help outline new guidelines for treatment.\nCurrent literature focuses on the probability of a fibroatrophic mechanism for the development of osteoradionecrosis, rather than the traditional vascular insufficiency mechanism. Because of the evolution of this new idea, as well as a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study finding no benefit from the use of hyperbaric oxygen for advanced osteoradionecrosis of the mandible, new treatment considerations have emerged. Ongoing research is also being conducted to clarify the role of osteoclasts in the pathogenesis of osteoradionecrosis. Restoration of blood supply or vascularized tissue to the affected area continues to be of primary importance in the resolution of osteoradionecrosis.\nIt is clear that the cause and pathogenesis of osteoradionecrosis are far more complex than originally believed.

{"title": "Retinal blood vessels develop in response to local VEGF-A signals in the absence of blood flow.", "abstract": "The role of hemodynamic forces and other signals from circulating blood in guiding the development of the retinal vasculature was examined by following the growth of these vessels in organ cultures. Retinal vascular development in organ cultures was monitored by immunofluorescent staining of retinal whole-mounts using antibodies against ICAM-2, a specific marker for endothelial cells and by vascular adenosine disphosphatase activity. Under culture conditions, the retinal vasculature from mice at postnatal day 3 (P3) grew from the optic nerve area to the edge of the retina in a manner similar to that observed in vivo. Both inner and outer vascular plexuses formed in retinal explants. Within the first few days of organ culture, the initial uniform meshwork of blood vessels was reorganized into arterioles, venules, and capillaries. As in animals, the initial retinal vascular plexus contained abundant vessels, and afterward some vessels regressed leading to the formation of a mature vascular bed. Changes in vascular density due to blood vessel growth and remodeling were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses of ICAM-2 mRNA and protein levels, respectively. In addition, during in vitro retinal vascularization, arterioles acquired mural cell coverage, as shown by positive staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin. Thus, blood flow and blood-derived signals were not required for the development and maturation of retinal vessels. In contrast, stability of blood vessels in retinal explants was tightly regulated by endogenous levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A was expressed in the explants throughout the culture period, and addition of neutralizing antibodies against VEGF-A to the organ culture caused a severe regression of blood vessels from the vascular front toward the optic nerve. In contrast, addition of anti-FGF-2 antibodies had no effect on the developing vasculature. Thus, retinal vascular development is dependent on local VEGF-A signals rather than systemic signals.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2005-07-14", "authors": ["Anna MariaCuratola", "DavidMoscatelli", "AsmaNorris", "KarenHendricks-Munoz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exer.2005.06.001"}

Systemic eEPC infusion into mice after ischemic cardiac insult increased postischemic heart output measured by a marked improvement in left ventricle developed pressure and both systolic and diastolic functions. In vitro, eEPCs strongly induced vascular outgrowths from aortic rings. To address the molecular basis of this intrinsic angiogenic potential, we investigated the eEPC transcriptome. Genome-wide Affymetrix GeneChip analysis revealed that the eEPCs express a wealth of secreted factors known to induce angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and organogenesis that may contribute to the eEPC-mediated beneficial effects.

During the past decade, advances in ophthalmic imaging systems have enabled the recognition of presumed new distinct choroidal neovascular lesions that share some unique clinical and angiographic peculiarities as well as better comprehension of the pathophysiologic mechanisms related to such entities. Amongst presumed newer exudative maculopathies, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, which has been described as a distinct choroidal abnormality characterized by inner choroidal vascular network of vessels ending in polyp-like structures only identified on indocyanine green angiography and mostly affecting African-American and Asian descendents, has gained special interest from the ophthalmic community particularly because of its growing recognition among patients with clinical appearance of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Thus far, however, the exact nature of the vascular structure of the polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy lesion remains unclear and data from recent studies have conflicted with the initial concept of a benign exudative maculopathy with long-term preservation of good vision. All together, such factors make difficult the establishment of an appropriate treatment, if any, for the entity. Herein, by using a modified technique of conventional indocyanine green angiography, we demonstrate new information about the morphologic characteristics, and to some extent the blood flow dynamics perfusion, of the polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy lesion. Our results suggest that the PCV lesion should be considered a variety of choroidal neovascularization rather than a distinct clinical entity, characterized by one single large neovascular complex presenting well-defined arterial neovascular vessels arising from one major \"ingrowth site\" and draining vessels that present aneurysm-like dilations corresponding to the polyp-like structures typically described for the entity. Finally, the visual acuity and angiographic findings observed after selective ingrowth site photothrombosis corroborate the existence of one major \"ingrowth site\" for the PCV neovascular complex and point toward a new treatment paradigm for this variety of choroidal neovascularization.", "journal": "Progress in retinal and eye research", "date": "2005-07-12", "authors": ["Rog\u00e9rio ACosta", "Eduardo VNavajas", "Michel EFarah", "DanielaCalucci", "Jose ACardillo", "Ingrid UScott"], "doi": "10.1016/j.preteyeres.2005.01.001"}

Several alpha7 null embryos were identified with cerebrovascular hemorrhages and showed reduced vascular smooth muscle cells and cerebral vascularization. The alpha7 null mice that survived to birth exhibited vascular smooth muscle defects, including hyperplasia and hypertrophy. In addition, altered expression of alpha5 and alpha6B integrin chains was detected in the cerebral arteries of alpha7 null mice, which may contribute to the vascular phenotype.

Localization of VEGF in the anterior pituitary raises the possibility that Ang must be present in the pituitary gland as well. In this study Ang expression was detected in the normal rat pituitary gland at the gene level by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. The latter was analyzed by both light and confocal microscopy. Constitutive expression of Ang1, Ang2, and their receptor Tie2 was detected at both the mRNA and protein level in all the pituitary glands studied. Of interest was the localization of both Ang1 and Ang2 in scattered PAS positive adenohypophysial cells rather than in endothelial cells. Confocal microscopy showed colocalization of both Ang1 and Ang2 proteins within the same adenohypophysial cells. Dual immunostaining for Ang1 and the anterior pituitary hormones that show PAS positivity demonstrated colocalization of Ang1 with follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. In the posterior pituitary, strong Ang1 signal observed in vascular endothelial cells masked the weak Ang2 signal, a pattern that is similar to that reported in brain endothelial cells. The presence of both angiopoietins and VEGF in the pituitary gland suggest that these ligands interact during angiogenesis as they are known to do in other systems to maintain the rich vascular network of the gland.

{"title": "Increased blood vessel density provides the mole rat physiological tolerance to its hypoxic subterranean habitat.", "abstract": "The blind subterranean mole rat superspecies Spalax ehrenbergi has evolved adaptations that allow it to survive and carry out intensive activities in its highly hypoxic underground sealed burrows. A key component of this adaptation is a higher capillary density in some Spalax tissues, primarily in muscles used in digging and in other energetic activities, resulting in a shorter diffusion distance for oxygen. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor that is critical for angiogenesis during development and is found in response to tissue ischemia. We demonstrate here that due to physiological differences, the Spalax muscle regulatory mechanism for VEGF is different than in Rattus muscle. In vivo, the constitutive level of the VEGF mRNA and the mRNA levels of its transcriptional regulator HIF-1alpha and its mRNA stabilizer HuR are significantly higher in Spalax muscle than in Rattus muscle. Furthermore, as opposed to Rattus, the mRNA levels of HIF-1alpha, HuR, VEGF, as well as that of LDH-A, the enzyme that catalyzes the production of lactate, an accepted marker of anaerobic metabolism, are not increased in Spalax after hypoxia. However, ex vivo, when oxygenation by blood vessels is no longer relevant, the expression pattern of all these genes is similar in the two rodents under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our studies provide evidence that the highly vascularized muscle in Spalax, the most energy consuming tissue during digging, is resistant to the effects of oxygen deprivation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate 64Cu-radiolabeled folate-conjugated shell cross-linked nanoparticles (SCKs) as candidate agents to shuttle radionuclides and drugs into tumors overexpressing the folate receptor (FR).\nSCKs were obtained by cross-linking the shell of micelles obtained from amphiphilic diblock copolymers. SCKs were then functionalized with folate, fluorescein thiosemicarbazide (FTSC), and 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (TETA). The specific interaction of SCK-folate with the FR was investigated on KB cells. The biodistributions of 64Cu-TETA-SCK and 64Cu-TETA-SCK-folate were evaluated in athymic mice bearing small-size KB cell xenografts (10-100 mg), whereas the intratumor distributions were investigated by autoradiography in 0.3- to 0.6-g KB cell xenografts.\nA global solution-state functionalization strategy has been introduced for attaching optimum numbers of targeting and imaging agents onto the SCKs for increasing the efficiency of interaction with cell-surface receptors. Epifluorescence microscopy confirmed the specific interaction of FTSC-SCK-folate with the FR in vitro. 64Cu labeling of TETA-SCKs led to the radiolabeled compounds with 15%-20% yield and >95% radiochemical purity. The biodistribution results demonstrated high accumulation of 64Cu-labeled SCKs in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (56.0 +/- 7.1 %ID/g and 45.7 +/- 3.5 %ID/g [percentage injected dose per gram] in liver at 10 min after injection for folated and nonfolated SCKs, respectively) and a prolonged blood circulation. No increase of SCK tumor uptake deriving from folate conjugation was observed (5.9 +/- 2.8 %ID/g and 6.0 +/- 1.9 %ID/g at 4 h after injection for folated and nonfolated SCKs, respectively). However, tumor accumulation was higher in small-size tumors, where competitive block of SCK-folate uptake with excess folate was observed. Autoradiography results confirmed the extravasation of radiolabeled SCKs in vascularized areas of the tumor, whereas no diffusion was observed in necrotic regions.\nDespite high RES uptake, the evaluated 64Cu-labeled SCKs exhibited long circulation in blood and were able to passively accumulate in tumors. Furthermore, SCK-folate uptake was competitively blocked by excess folate in small-size solid tumors, suggesting interaction with the FR. For these reasons, functionalized SCKs are promising drug-delivery agents for imaging and therapy of early-stage solid tumors.", "journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine", "date": "2005-07-08", "authors": ["RaffaellaRossin", "DipanjanPan", "KaiQi", "Jeffrey LTurner", "XiankaiSun", "Karen LWooley", "Michael JWelch"], "doi": null}

It is involved in many normal and diseased conditions, as well as in the application of tissue-engineered products. There has been extensive effort made to develop strategies for controlling pathological angiogenesis and for promoting vascularization in biomedical engineering applications. Central to advancing these strategies is a mechanistic understanding of the angiogenic process. Angiogenesis is tightly regulated by local tissue environmental factors, including soluble molecules, extracellular matrices, cell-cell interactions, and diverse mechanical forces. Great advances have been made in identifying the biochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the control of angiogenesis. This review focuses on work that explores the biophysical aspect of angiogenesis regulation. Specifically, we discuss the role of cell-generated forces, counterforces from the extracellular matrix, and mechanical forces associated with blood flow and extravascular tissue activity in the regulation of angiogenesis. Because angiogenesis occurs in a mechanically dynamic environment, future investigations should aim at understanding how cells integrate chemical and mechanical signals so that a rational approach to controlling angiogenesis will become possible.

In the current study the pattern of vascular supply of the proximal humerus was studied in six cadavers by the corrosion technique. Furthermore, the effect of fractures on the vascular supply was also investigated. In all preparations the intraosseous arteries of the humeral head arose from the circumflex arteries, which surrounded the humerus and dispatched branches towards the proximal end. The main vessel was the branch of the anterior circumflex artery, penetrating the major tubercle in six of six cases. Due to the intraosseous arch shape of this vessel it is referred to as the arcuate artery. Besides other smaller vessels, there was also a vascular network arising from the posterior circumflex artery. Their branches penetrated medially at the cartilage bone interface in five of six preparations. The medial bone arteries appear to gain distinctive importance in humeral head fractures by their impact on the vascularisation of the fracture fragments. After disruption of the arterial supply from the arcuate artery, the vascularisation of the head fragments is most likely ensured by this group of vessels.

One of the main issues in this approach is the limited viability of transplanted cells because vascularization of the scaffold site is either too slow or insufficient. We now address this by enhancing scaffold vascularization before cell transplantation via sustained delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and by examining the liver lobes as a platform for transplanting donor hepatocytes in close proximity to the host liver. The vascularization kinetics of unseeded VEGF-releasing scaffolds on rat liver lobes were evaluated by analyzing the microvascular density and tissue ingrowth in implants harvested on days 3, 7, and 14 postimplantation. Capillary density was greater at all times in VEGF-releasing scaffolds than in the control scaffold without VEGF supplementation; on day 14, it was 220 +/- 33 versus 139 +/- 23 capillaries/mm2 (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 35% of the newly formed capillaries in VEGF-releasing scaffolds were larger than 16 microm in diameter, whereas in control scaffolds only 10% exceeded this size. VEGF had no effect on tissue ingrowth into the scaffolds. HT onto the implanted VEGF-releasing or control scaffolds was performed after 1 week of prevascularization on the liver lobe in Lewis rats. Fifty implants were harvested on days 1, 3, 7, and 12 and the area of viable hepatocytes was evaluated.

Our observations in raccoons demonstrated a photoreceptor layer associated with rich lymph and a poorly vascularized retina. The meridian region of the eye, which lies in the horizontal plane and pass around the optic disc, had a markedly sparse capillary network. This horizontal sparse vascular band may correspond to a visual streak. Ciliary process capillaries were delicate, and formed a well-developed and compact network. Choriocapillaries were quite thin and formed a coarse capillary network. This contrasted with the dense retinal and well-extended choroidal capillary networks noted in the macaques. Our findings suggest that the sparse retinal capillary network in raccoons is extremely beneficial for photon capture, thereby allowing the raccoon to see well at night, as the retinal vessels restrict the inflow of photons toward the photoreceptors.

This study evaluated the functional results of zygomatic implants and vascularized bone graft reconstruction of the maxillary defects in 4 patients.\nComplex resections of the maxilla produced a three-dimensional defect in 4 patients. On the basis of an axial spiral CT data, anatomical models of natural size by CAD/CAM system was manufactured to enable preoperative measurements of relevant parameters. After tumor resection, reconstruction using the fibula or iliac osteocutaneous flap with titanium osseointegrated implants was performed. Maxillary and zygomatic measurements were also used to obtain information for installing 6 zygomatic implants and 7 dental implants.\nThe bone from the fibula or iliac osteocutaneous flap was contoured to recreate the maxillary arch in 4 patients. The anatomical model and surgical palate was used for preoperative planning and intraoperative control of the insertion of 6 zygomatic fixtures after subtotal maxillectomy. The implants could be positioned precisely as preoperatively planned.\nThe use of zygomatic fixtures after ablative tumor surgery with resection of the maxillary bone is valuable in providing new zygomatic buttresses that play a key role in the form of the midface. Maxillary rehabilitation can be further improved by using the vascularized bone graft and zygomatic implants. Reconstitutions of the buttresses system ensure a stable base for occlusion, which is essential to optimal functional and esthetic maxillary rehabilitation.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm to rescue the extremity from amputation and to restore the functional ability combined with coverage of the defects. After initial management with decompression and debridement of the nonviable tissues surrounding the brachial artery, we used local fasciocutaneous flaps or pedicled latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle/musculocutaneous flaps immediately to cover and also to avoid the perforation of this artery with a mean of 5.5 operations and with an amputation rate of 12.5%. When perforation or necrotic focus was seen on the arterial wall without viable tissue around the brachial artery, circulation was restored with vein grafts. Deep defects in the cubital fossa with exposure of the brachial artery should be covered with well-vascularized tissue as soon as possible after serial debridements. If the necrotic focus is seen on the wall of the artery, it often requires a venous graft with flap coverage. In the presence of viable tissue around the artery, however, fasciocutaneous flaps are useful and they reduce the operation time and duration of hospital stay. We treated deep defects with exposure of the brachial artery in the cubital fossa according to our established algorithm.

To support the hypothesis that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are antiangiogenic for IMTs by interfering with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling via cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition, IMT specimens were immunohistochemically examined for expression of COX-2 enzyme and VEGF.\nThe diagnosis of IMT was confirmed in all 18 cases comprising the study.

The vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall was carefully reviewed, and they reported Huger's classification into three zones (zones I, II, and III). The third zone, which corresponds to the lateral areas of the abdomen, provides the vascular supply to the undermined abdominal wall flaps. Whenever this lateral vascularization is spared, there is no risk of skin necrosis.

In unique demand situations, a vascularized fibular flap is regarded as an \"improvement\" to the standard procedure. While a vascularized flap does deliver living tissue to the region, it does so with added potential morbidity and increased technical demand. The indications in the literature for this procedure have not been clearly defined. In this article, the authors review specific high-demand situations where they believe a vascularized flap is indicated. They also review patient outcomes after this procedure.\nFibular free flaps were used in six patients with failed previous cervical spine arthrodeses. Three of the six patients had preoperative radiation therapy, and one received postoperative radiation treatment. All six patients had tumor and/or osteomyelitis present.\nOne patient died of intraoperative hypotension 3 days after a successful free flap transfer during an elective posterior spine instrumentation procedure. One flap was lost from a venous thrombosis, and the patient was then treated successfully with a second fibular free flap. Clinical and radio-graphic evidence of fusion was obtained at 3 months in the five surviving patients, and neurologic function remained stable or improved.\nAnalyzing their results and the literature, the authors propose that fibular free flaps are indeed a useful adjunct in difficult cervical spine stabilization procedures.

Hypervascular lesions were embolized 3 to 5 days before surgery. The same surgical technique was used to resect all tumors. The surgical defect was covered with vascularized myofascial flaps. The internal carotid artery was infiltrated in two patients, and a saphenous graft bypass was carried out before removal of the lesions.

In the present study we evaluated the mechanisms by which a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, affects tumor growth of two differentially invasive human breast cancer cell lines.\nMDA-MB-231 (highly invasive) and MDA-MB-468 (moderately invasive) cell lines were treated with varying concentrations of celecoxib in vitro, and the effects of this agent on cell growth and angiogenesis were monitored by evaluating cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and vasculogenic mimicry. The in vitro results of MDA-MB-231 cell line were further confirmed in vivo in a mouse xenograft model.\nThe highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells express higher levels of COX-2 than do the less invasive MDA-MB-468 cells. Celecoxib treatment inhibited COX-2 activity, indicated by prostaglandin E2 secretion, and caused significant growth arrest in both breast cancer cell lines. In the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, the mechanism of celecoxib-induced growth arrest was by induction of apoptosis, associated with reduced activation of protein kinase B/Akt, and subsequent activation of caspases 3 and 7. In the less invasive MDA-MB-468 cells, growth arrest was a consequence of cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 checkpoint. Celecoxib-induced growth inhibition was reversed by addition of exogenous prostaglandin E2 in MDA-MB-468 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, MDA-MB-468 cells formed significantly fewer extracellular matrix associated microvascular channels in vitro than did the high COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Celecoxib treatment not only inhibited cell growth and vascular channel formation but also reduced vascular endothelial growth factor levels. The in vitro findings corroborated in vivo data from a mouse xenograft model in which daily administration of celecoxib significantly reduced tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 cells, which was associated with reduced vascularization and increased necrosis in the tumor mass.\nThe disparate molecular mechanisms of celecoxib-induced growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells depends upon the level of COX-2 expression and the invasive potential of the cell lines examined.

{"title": "Quantitation of microvessel density in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck by computer-aided image analysis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from a preexisting vascular network. In healthy individuals it is normally suppressed and observed only transiently during development, reproduction and wound healing. However, growth, invasion, and metastasis of most solid tumors are dependent on angiogenesis. Without formation of new blood vessels, also termed as neovascularization, tumors cannot exceed a size of about 1 mm3. Therefore, neovascularization is a basic requirement for nutrition and oxygenation of tumor cells. Numerous studies in different solid as well as non-solid tumors have evaluated the prognostic value of tumor neovascularization. In solid tumors the increased microvessel density, the pathological correlate to tumor neovascularization, has been linked to a worse prognosis of the disease. The aim of the current study was to assess the prognostic value of tumor neovascularization for recurrences in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck by determining microvessel density. Data was collected using an automated-computerized method and as well as a manual counting method.\nImmunohistochemistry was performed to detect intratumoral microvessels in tumor samples of 50 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We used a monoclonal mouse antibody directed against the CD34 antigen. After immunostaining, the entire tumor section was scanned microscopically at low power (x 40) to identify hot spots, which are the areas of highest neovascularization. Individual tumor microvessels were then counted under high power (x 200) to obtain a vessel count in a defined area, and the average vessel count in 4 hot spots was taken as the microvessel density. Microvessel counting was performed twice by computerized method, as well as manually by two independent investigators without any previous knowledge of patients' pertinent clinical data. Subsequently, both counting techniques were statistically compared with each other.\nOn computer-aided image analysis an increased microvessel density was significantly correlated with recurrence of disease (p = 0.02). Repetitive computer counts yielded similar results (p = 0.08), whereas repeated manual counts by two investigators varied significantly (p = 0.04). However, no further statistical correlations between microvessel density and patients clinical data i.e. tumor status, lymph node status, overall survival, or disease free interval could be found. Furthermore, estimation of overall survival of patients with an increased microvessel density by Kaplan-Meier curves revealed non-significant results.\nThere is mounting evidence that suggests, that assessment of tumor neovascularization might provide a novel approach of prognostication in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. In particular, in the present study, the degree of angiogenesis of a tumor, as assessed by microvessel density, was found to be correlated with recurrent disease in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Computer aided image analysis, an automated technique, constitutes a time-efficient and reproducible technique for quantification of tumor vascularization. We suggest that this computerized microvessel determination could be used as a reliable method for microvessel counts, which, furthermore, seems to be superior to manual counting.

In all other situations, and in nonreplantable amputations, there is no alternative but to reconstruct the penis using autologous tissues to create the most similar substitute, hoping for a possible allogeneic transplantation in the future. There are many unresolved issues and unanswered questions related to functional recovery after replantation of the penis. In this study, to overcome these drawbacks and to guide and show the feasibility of allogeneic transplantation of the penis in humans in the future, we describe a penile composite tissue flap based on the internal pudendal artery and its autotransplantation in an economical animal species. Fifty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 400 to 500 g were used. In 20 rats, the vascular anatomy of the male perineal region was determined by anatomic dissections. Based on this anatomic study, the penile composite flap was created based on the internal pudendal vessels. In 10 rats, the penile flap was raised as an island flap based on its vascular pedicle and replaced in situ. In 10 rats, distant flap transfer was accomplished to determine the feasibility of the flap being transferred as a free flap and to demonstrate the viability of the flap components in a heterotopic region. For this purpose, the flap was transferred to the groin region performing anastomoses between internal pudendal vessels and superficial epigastric vessels. In the control group (n=10), while the same surgical procedure was performed, the flap was transferred to the groin region but no anastomosis was performed. The procedure required approximately 3 to 4 hours of operating time in the free flap group. Five of the animals died in the early postoperative days, while all others survived. Direct observation and microangiography were used to assess the viability of the flaps. On the basis of direct observation on the seventh postoperative day, all the pedicled flaps survived completely. In the free-flap group, all but 1 of the vascularized flaps showed complete survival, whereas all the nonvascularized flaps completely necrosed. The authors conclude that the penile flap of the rat offers the following advantages: (1) the composite tissue flap is harvested from a small animal species, (2) the flap is an exact representation of the clinical original penile composition, (3) it can be transferred as a free flap without the need for an isogeneic animal, (4) the vascular pedicle is consistent and allows for microvascular anastomoses. The flap will provide a means for future physiological studies, especially for replantation cases. The feasible autotransplantation of the penile flap with successful results will also guide researchers towards the future allogeneic transfer of the penis in humans.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2005-06-30", "authors": ["MustafaAkyurek", "OmerOzkan", "TuncSafak", "H EgeOzgentas", "Raymond MDunn"], "doi": "10.1097/01.sap.0000164521.17537.b3"}

To assess the ability of CEUS to identify the vascularization of solid pancreatic tumors in comparison to helical CT.\nForty-two resected pancreatic tumors, found at US, were studied with CEUS and helical CT. The tumor enhancement at CEUS was scored in comparison to the baseline aspect of the lesion and/or the extralesional pancreatic parenchyma together with the adjacent vessels during the dynamic study. All the lesions underwent pathological examination using H&E stains and CD34 markers with an evaluation of the microvessel density (MVD). The correlation of CEUS and helical CT with the MVD of the lesions was established with Spearman's test.\nThe correlation of CEUS with the MVD of the lesions was significantly superior (Rs = 0.914; p < 0.0001) to that of helical CT (Rs = 0.635; p < 0.0001).\nCEUS is better than helical CT in the identification of the vascularization of solid pancreatic tumors. CEUS, when the pancreatic gland is optimally visualized, should be therefore considered a complementary imaging modality in the characterization of pancreatic tumors.

Herein we wanted to evaluate whether creation of pores in Pelvicol, facilitating ingrowth of fibrous tissue and vessels, would result in a higher tensile strength at d30 without compromising longer term results.\nFirst tensile strength of Pelvicol modified with different pore sizes was evaluated ex vivo. In a second step, Pelvicol implants with pores were used to cover full-thickness abdominal wall defects in 36 rats. Implants were either Pelvicol (non-porous) or with pores of Phi : 0.7, 1.2, or 2.0 mm (n=6 each). Animals were sacrificed on d30 and 90 to evaluate the presence of herniation, infection, adhesions, change in thickness and tensile strength. Histopathology was performed to assess inflammatory response and collagen deposition. Data were compared to available data on Prolene implanted animals at same time points.\nPelvicol with pore diameter of 2.5 mm was significantly weaker ex vivo. Animals repaired with non-porous material did develop seroma (2/6) or clinical infection (1/6) whereas none in the other groups did. There was a trend for increasing tensile strength at 30 d with increasing pore diameter, being significant in the 2.0-mm pore size group. This difference disappeared by 90 d, where all materials were equally strong as Prolene. The foreign body reaction was less intense in a pore-size dependent manner, with more abundant neo-vascularization and collagen deposition passing through the pores.\nCreation of pores in Pelvicol promotes neo-vascularization, collagen deposition, and fibrous tissue ingrowth, and at pore size 2.0 mm tensile strength was increased at d30 whereafter all materials had comparable strength.", "journal": "Neurourology and urodynamics", "date": "2005-06-25", "authors": ["FangZheng", "EricVerbeken", "Dirkde Ridder", "JanDeprest"], "doi": "10.1002/nau.20148"}

The characterization of arterial- and venous-specific genes may improve our understanding of cardiovascular development and disease. Here we report the results of a subtractive hybridization screen for arterial-specific genes, and describe in detail the expression of a novel arterial-specific gene, Depp (decidual protein induced by progesterone), using a GFP-Cre knock-in that permits a comparison of both instantaneous and cumulative expression patterns in situ. Several features of Depp expression are noteworthy. First, Depp is expressed in endothelial cells of peripheral tissues, but not in atrial or ventricular endocardial cells of the heart. Very few genes have been reported to discriminate between these two cell types, and therefore this specificity may be useful in generating conditional mutations in other genes implicated in cardiovascular development. Second, Depp reveals an unexpected degree of molecular heterogeneity among arterial endothelial cells. Third, Depp is up-regulated in subsets of endothelial cells, in settings of adult neo-vascularization, including tumor angiogenesis. Taken together, these data reveal unanticipated temporal and spatial heterogeneity among arterial endothelial cells of various tissues and organs, raising new questions regarding the functional significance of this diversity.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2005-06-25", "authors": ["DonghunShin", "David JAnderson"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.20479"}

We show here that the retina in Col18a1-/- mice becomes densely vascularized by anomalous anastomoses from the persistent hyaloid vasculature by day 10 after birth. In situ hybridizations revealed normal VEGF mRNA expression, but the phenotype of collagen XVIII deficient mice closely resembled that of mice expressing VEGF120 and VEGF188 isoforms only, suggesting that type XVIII collagen may be involved in VEGF function. Type XVIII collagen was found to be indispensable for angiogenesis in the eye, as also oxygen-induced neovascularization was less intense than normal in the Col18a1-/- mice. We observed a marked increase in the amount of retinal astrocytes in the Col18a1-/- mice. Whereas the retinal vessels of wild-type mice are covered by astrocytes and the regressing, thin hyaloid vessels are devoid of astrocytes, the retinal vessels in the Col18a1-/- mice were similarly covered by astrocytes but not the persistent hyaloid vessels in the vitreous body. Interestingly, double null mice lacking type XVIII collagen and its homologue type XV collagen had the persistent hyaloid vessels covered by astrocytes, including the parts located in the vitreous body. We thus hypothesize that type XV collagen is a regulator of glial cell recruitment around vessels and that type XVIII collagen regulates their proliferation.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2005-06-25", "authors": ["MerjaHurskainen", "LauriEklund", "Pasi OH\u00e4gg", "MarcusFruttiger", "RaijaSormunen", "MikaIlves", "TainaPihlajaniemi"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.04-3101fje"}

Cellular distribution was determined using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify the findings of vasculature. Biochemical assays were performed to quantify DNA, collagen, and elastin content of each of the six different types of chordae tendineae.\nBlood vessels were observed in the longitudinal and circumferential directions of the chordae. The strut chordae on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve showed an increased degree of vascularization compared with the other chordae. All chordae had an inner layer characterized by a high concentration of collagen and an outer layer that was mostly elastin with interwoven collagen fibers. The collagen microstructure was characterized by directional crimping. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed fibroblasts evenly distributed throughout the inner and outer layer of the chordae tendineae. Quantitative analysis showed significantly higher levels of DNA and collagen content in the anterior and posterior marginal chordae compared with the other chordae.\nThe chordae tendineae were seen to have different microstructures according to chordal type. The presence of vessels characterized the chordae tendineae as complex living components that work in coordination with the papillary muscles and mitral valve leaflets to prevent mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation.

In this clinical report, prosthodontic rehabilitation of oral function in a bilateral maxillecitomy patient combined with a new fibular osteocutaneous flap, which was designed to have two oronasal slits for the retention of an obturator prosthesis, was described. A 58-year-old man with a maxillary alveolar carcinoma underwent bilateral maxillectomy. The defect was reconstructed using a vascularized fibular bone wrapped circumferentially with a peroneal flap, which was fixed with miniplates between the right malar prominence and cut edge of the left zygoma remaining two slits anterior and posterior to the graft. Two and half weeks after the surgery, a delayed surgical obturator was delivered and an obturator prosthesis was delivered 6 weeks after the surgery. This obturator prosthesis could be extended into the slits to engage the tissue undercuts, and was stable during use. Mastication, deglutition, articulation and the mid-facial profile of the patient were rehabilitated. After installation of the obturator prosthesis, relining of the prosthesis base was carried out alongside the healing process of the graft, and adjustment of occlusions and high-pressure spots was carried out. No clinical disorders were observed either in the grafted tissue or the obturator prosthesis with a 3-year prognosis.

However, when applied in solution, b-FGF rapidly diffuses from the implant site. In another approach for tissue engineering, poly-lactide-based copolymers have shown promise as scaffolds for chondrocytes used to tissue engineer auricular cartilage in the shape of an ear. This study evaluated the effectiveness of b-FGF impregnated in gelatin microspheres to achieve slow growth factor release for augmenting the in vivo chondrogenic response. Whereas 125I-labeled b-FGF injected in solution showed rapid in vivo clearance from the injection site (only 3% residual after 24 h), when incorporated into gelatin microspheres, 44% and 18% of the b-FGF remained at 3 and 14 days, respectively. Canine chondrocytes were isolated and grown in vitro onto ear-shaped poly-lactide/caprolactone copolymers for 1 week, then implanted into the dorsal subcutaneous tissue of nude mice; implants contained b-FGF either in free solution or in gelatin microspheres. A third group underwent preinjection of b-FGF in gelatin microspheres 4 days before chondrocyte-copolymer implantation. The implants with b-FGF-incorporated microspheres showed the greatest chondrogenic characteristics at 5 and 10 weeks postoperatively: good shape and biomechanical trait retention, strong (histologic) metachromasia, rich vascularization of surrounding tissues, and increased gene expression for type II collagen (cartilage marker) and factor VIII-related antigen (vascular marker). In the case of implant site preadministration with b-FGF-impregnated microspheres, the implant architecture was not maintained as well, and reduced vascularization and metachromasia was also apparent.

Organ shortage for primary transplants and retransplants has led to donor-pool expansion to include elderly donors, knowing that aging per se promotes arteriosclerosis. The current understanding that donor age negatively affects organ and/or patient survival outcome is undermined by variables such as the use of immunosuppressive drugs, their toxicity to the graft, degree of donor-recipient histocompatibility, and the resulting chronic rejection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the donor's age or recipient's age matters the most in transplant arteriosclerosis in the absence of such variables.\nA syngeneic combination was used where young (2-month-old) and old (22-month-old) donor aortas were injured to initiate neointimal thickening, then transplanted into age-mismatched recipients for 14, 60, and 90 days and then assessed for neointimal thickening. Base level injury response due ischemia and surgery was evaluated in age-matched and noninjured aortic grafts, respectively.\nYoung aortas invariably developed thicker neointima when transplanted into old recipients than when transplanted into young ones. Correspondingly, old aortas transplanted in young recipients consistently developed less neointimal thickening than when transplanted into old recipients.\nOur findings strongly suggest that the severity of age-related neointima formation is primarily determined by the recipient's age rather than the donor's age.

{"title": "EGFL7 is a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and is up-regulated in angiogenesis and arterial injury.", "abstract": "The endothelium of the adult vasculature is normally quiescent, with the exception of the vasculature of the female reproductive system. However, in response to appropriate stimuli (ie, wound healing, atherosclerosis, tumor growth and metastasis, arthritis) the vasculature becomes activated and grows new capillaries through angiogenesis. We have recently identified a novel endothelial-restricted gene, Egfl7, that encodes a 41-kd secreted protein (Fitch MJ, Campagnolo L, Kuhnert F, Stuhlmann H: Egfl7, a novel epidermal growth factor-domain gene expressed in endothelial cells. Dev Dyn 2004, 230:316-324). Egfl7 is expressed at high levels early during mouse embryonic development and is strictly associated with the vascular bed. In this study, we investigated Egfl7 expression in the quiescent adult vasculature, in the pregnant uterus, and in two different models of arterial injury, namely ballooning and ferric chloride injury. By RNA in situ hybridization, Egfl7 expression in the vasculature was found to be restricted to the endothelium of the capillaries and mature vessels. In the pregnant uterus, increased vascularization was accompanied by up-regulation of Egfl7. On arterial injury, Egfl7 expression was up-regulated in the regenerating endothelium, but not in the neointima. Importantly, the EGFL7 protein acted as a chemoattractant for embryonic endothelial cells and fibroblasts in a cell migration assay. Together, these results suggest that Egfl7 functions in the formation and maintenance of endothelial integrity and that its up-regulation may be a critical component in the reorganization of the vascular bed in response to angiogenic stimuli.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2005-06-24", "authors": ["LuisaCampagnolo", "AmyLeahy", "SmitaChitnis", "StefanKoschnick", "Michael JFitch", "John TFallon", "DavidLoskutoff", "Mark BTaubman", "HeidiStuhlmann"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62972-0"}

Fifteen patients who had at least 2 noncontiguous, uniradicular teeth indicated for extraction were selected. In group I, the extraction sockets were covered by ADMG alone; and in group II, the alveoli were filled with RHA before the placement of the ADMG. After 6 months, re-entry surgeries and biopsies were performed. Although ridge thickness had been preserved in both groups, the means were significantly greater (P < 0.05) for group II when compared to group I (6,8 +/- 1.26 and 5.53 +/- 1.06). The histologic analysis showed small bone formation in some samples for group II, where the presence of a highly vascularized fibrous connective tissue surrounding the particles was a common finding. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the ADMG was able to preserve ridge thickness and that the additional use of RHA favored the preservation of the ridges along with an increase in the width of keratinized tissue.", "journal": "Implant dentistry", "date": "2005-06-22", "authors": ["Sonia MLuczyszyn", "VulaPapalexiou", "Arthur BNovaes", "M\u00e1rcio F MGrisi", "S\u00e9rgio L SSouza", "M\u00e1rioTaba"], "doi": "10.1097/01.id.0000165082.77499.41"}

However, little is known about the direct effects of VEGF on tumor cells. In this study, we investigate the ability of VEGF to promote proliferation and invasion of human glioma cells (U251n). Since the chemokine and its receptor, SDF-1/CXCR4, promote glioma cell proliferation and are up-regulated in human glioblastomas, we also tested the effects of VEGF on SDF-1 and CXCR4 mRNA expression. Using cell culture, the effect of VEGF on proliferation of U251n cells was measured using ELISA to detect incorporated BrdU as a marker of DNA syntheses. The effects of VEGF and SDF-1 on U251n cell invasion and proliferation were measured using inhibitors to VEGF receptor1 and receptor2, DC101 and MF1, respectively, and a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100). SDF-1 and CXCR4 mRNA expression in U251n and U87MG cells were measured using quantitative PCR. VEGF antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-VEGF) was also used to down-regulate VEGF expression in U251n cells. VEGF significantly increased U251n cell proliferation and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were blocked by the VEGF receptor inhibitors, DC101/MF1. The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 blocked U251n increased invasion, but not proliferation. CXCR4 and SDF-1 mRNA were up-regulated when U251n and U87MG cells were treated with VEGF.

It is based on 1- to 10 microm-sized gas microbubbles, which can cross the capillary beds of the lungs and are effective echo enhancers. It is known that high cell density, high transendothelial fluid exchange, and poorly functioning lymphatic circulation all provoke solid stress, which compresses vessels and drastically reduces tumor blood flow. Given their size, we supposed that the perfusion of microbubbles is affected by anatomic features of tumor vessels more than are contrast agents traditionally used in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Here, we compared dynamic information obtained from CEUS and DCE-MRI on two experimental tumor models exhibiting notable differences in vessel anatomy. We found that tumors with small, flattened vessels show a much higher resistance to microbubble perfusion than to MRI contrast agents, and appear scarcely vascularized at CEUS examination, despite vessel volume adequate for normal function. Thus, whereas CEUS alone could induce incorrect diagnosis when tumors have small or collapsed vessels, integrated analysis using CEUS and DCE-MRI allows in vivo identification of tumors with a vascular profile frequently associated with malignant phenotypes.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2005-06-22", "authors": ["MircoGali\u00e8", "MirkoD'Onofrio", "MauraMontani", "AugustoAmici", "LauraCalderan", "PasquinaMarzola", "DonatellaBenati", "FlaviaMerigo", "CristinaMarchini", "AndreaSbarbati"], "doi": "10.1593/neo.04730"}

Diagnostic approach and prognostic interpretation are still matter of controversy. The case reported herein may summarize some of the issues in this regard. A 54-year-old woman, on renal replacement therapy since 1974, and a kidney graft recipient from 1975 to 1999, received a second graft in 2001. The donor age was 65 years (cold ischemia 22 hours; two mismatches). The early posttransplant follow-up was characterized by delayed graft function, hypertension, and diabetes. During the initial hypertension workup, renal graft ultrasound (US) Doppler demonstrated increased vascular resistances, stable over time (resistance index 0.74 to 0.77); renal scintiscan displayed homogeneously parenchymoa and angio-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an homogeneous parenchymal vascularization. Initial immunosuppression with tacrolimus and steroids was modulated by adding mycophenolate mofetil to taper tacrolimus (to reduce nephrotoxicity and hypertension). Despite this, kidney function slowly deteriorated; serum creatinine reached 3 to 3.5 mg/dL by the second year. After a severe hypertensive crisis with unchanged scintiscan and US doppler examinations, angio-MRI revealed the almost complete disappearance of parenchymal enhancement beyond the lobar arteries. A renal biopsy confirmed the severe vascular damage. The patient was switched to rapamycine and a low-dose of an angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. She did relatively well (serum creatinine 2.2 to 3 mg/dL) for 6 months, when rapid functional impairment forced her to restart hemodialysis.

However, the exact incidence of protein C and/or S deficiency in patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency has not been established. Furthermore, given the lack of adequate studies to define the natural history and angiographic findings of these patients, the treatment has not been well delineated. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to investigate the prevalence, characteristic angiographic findings and optimal treatments in patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency associated with protein C and/or S deficiency. Between September 2000 and August 2004, 133 patients who presented with peripheral arterial insufficiency underwent hypercoagulability tests before the initiation of any treatments. Of these, 11 patients (8.3%) with protein C and/or S deficiency were included in this study. There were nine males and two females. The ages ranged from 38 years to 72 years (mean 57 years). All patients showed characteristic angiographic findings: long segment thrombotic occlusion of a main peripheral artery without evidence of atherosclerosis or with mild atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and other major arterial trees.

The variables analyzed were cervical volume (cm3), vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). Intraobserver repeatability was expressed as the difference between two measurement results (mean difference +/- 2 SD, i.e. limits of agreement) and as intraclass correlation coefficient (intra-CC). Interobserver agreement was expressed as the difference between the results of the two observers (limits of agreement) and as interclass correlation coefficient (inter-CC). The contribution of various factors (examiner, acquisition, analysis of acquired volume) to intrasubject variance was estimated using different analysis of variance models.

The results presented are those obtained after antilogarithmic transformation, i.e. the results are presented as ratios between two results of the same observer, or as ratios between the results of Observer 1 and Observer 2.\nAll intraobserver and interobserver log-transformed differences were normally distributed.

Treatment of NeuYD or NeuYD x VEGF mice with rapamycin dramatically inhibited tumor growth accompanied by a marked decrease in tumor vascularization.

In this work we used vector-based RNA interference to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that transduction with a plasmid carrying a small interfering RNA targeting all isoforms of VEGF, dramatically impairs the expression of this growth factor in the human prostate cancer cell line PC3. As a consequence, PC3 cells loose their ability to induce one of the fundamental steps of angiogenesis, namely the formation of a tube-like network in vitro. Most importantly, our \"therapeutic\" vector is able to impair tumor growth rate and vascularization in vivo. We show that a single injection of naked plasmid in developing neoplastic mass significantly decreases microvessel density in an androgen-refractory prostate xenograft and is able to sustain a long-term slowing down of tumor growth.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of relaxin on the development of vascular tissue at wound sites in a novel VEGF receptor 2-luc (VEGFR2-luc) transgenic mouse wound model by monitoring the rate of VEGFR2-luc-mediated gene expression using bioluminescence and real-time imaging. To this end, 12 FVB/N VEGFR2-luc transgenic male mice were assigned to treatments (six per group): saline alone or relaxin (1 g/6 h/14 days) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). On day 0, a set of full-thickness wounds (6-mm punch) were generated under anesthesia on the dorsal aspect of each mouse. Photonic emissions were recorded (5-min collection of photons) from wound sites 10 min after the administration of luciferin (150 mg/kg i.p.) on day 0 and on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 postwounding to quantify luciferase activity using an IVIS 100 biophotonic imaging system. Animals were sacrificed (three per group) on day 7 or 14, and wound tissue specimens were recovered for molecular and histologic analyses. Although photonic emission from wound sites increased (P < .001) over time with peak values obtained by day 7, no significant (P > .05) effect of relaxin treatment on VEGFR2-luc gene expression was noted at wound sites. Whereas measuring relaxin's effect on angiogenesis indirectly via the VEGFR2 model was not successful, photonic imaging provides an exciting new tool using alternative models (i.e., VEGF-luc mouse) to study relaxin-induced gene expression in normal (i.e., wound healing) or tumorigenic tissues in real time.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2005-06-16", "authors": ["Peter LRyan", "Ramey CYoungblood", "JaneHarvill", "Scott TWillard"], "doi": "10.1196/annals.1282.061"}

This study was designed to determine whether new vascularized bone could be engineered by transplantation of osteoblasts around existing vascular pedicles using biodegradable, synthetic polymer as a cell delivery vehicle. Cells were isolated from the periosteum of fetal bovine humerus, and then seeded onto non-woven multifilament, polyglycolic acid polymer. The polymers provided three dimensional support during in vitro culture. The cell-polymer constructs were maintained in vitro for two weeks and then implanted around the right femoral vessels of twelve athymic nude rats. The polymer templates without the cells were implanted around left femoral vessels of each mouse as a control. Twelve rats were sacrificed at the following intervals: three rats at six,and nine rats at nine weeks. New bone formation was evident in 10 out of the 12 periosteal-derived cell seeded implants. At six weeks, the tissue was primarily composed of what appeared both grossly and histologically to be cartilage enveloping small islands of osteoid. The degree of osteoid and bone formation progressed with time, as blood vessels invaded the tissue. This tissue ultimately underwent morphogenesis to become an organized trabeculated bone with a vascular pedicle.

Applications for bone defect replacement in undesirable clinical circumstances such as large defects, bacterial or other pathogen-contaminated fields, and irradiated surgical wound bed necessitate vascularized bone regeneration. Use of a fascial flap including regenerated bone would be a very powerful tool for treatment. It would be especially beneficial in cases where normal bone regeneration is not expected due to a lack of sufficient blood supply, extensive surgical scarring, or bacterial contamination. In this study, we used nude rats in which the superficial epigastric flap of the experimental group was used to wrap around a mixture of human mesenchymal stem cells, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and basic fibroblast growth factor cytokines in a gelatin carrier. These rats showed significantly higher bone mineral density at 4 weeks compared to the other experimental groups containing phosphate buffered saline, human mesenchymal stem cells alone, or the two cytokines alone (p < 0.01). There were no remarkable histologic differences up to 7 days. At 2 weeks, more progressive vascularity and perivascular tissue deposits were seen in the experimental group. Basophilic mineral structure surrounded the fibroblast-like mesenchymal stem cells at 4 weeks, presumably osteoblastic or osteoclastic cell lining. Bone marker immunohistochemistry against alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin revealed diffuse and distinct immunoreactivity in osteoblastic cells in the experimental group at 4 weeks. Further transcriptional expression of polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2alphaA suggested that the human transplanted cells proceeded to osteogenic lineage in 4 weeks.

Oxidized regenerated cellulose/collagen (ORC/collagen) has been shown to improve wound healing of chronic wounds. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of ORC/collagen on dermal and epidermal healing as well as growth factor concentration in acute wounds. Rats received a full-thickness excision wound and were treated with either ORC/collagen plus a hydrocolloid dressing or a hydrocolloid dressing alone. Planimetry, immunological assays, histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine dermal and epidermal regeneration, protein concentration, and growth factor concentration. In addition, dermal vascularization and structure were determined. Wounds treated with ORC/collagen showed a significantly faster reepithelization than those treated with hydrocolloid alone, p < 0.05. This accelerated wound healing rate may be explained by significantly higher levels of platelet-derived growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in the ORC/collagen group leading to antiapoptotic effects of skin cells, p < 0.05. There were no significant differences in collagen morphology or deposition, neo-angiogenesis, or vascular endothelial growth factor concentration between both treatment groups. We conclude that ORC/collagen matrix accelerates epidermal regeneration and locally increases growth factor concentrations. Increased reepithelization was associated with decreased skin cell apoptosis.

Gene transfer with virus vectors has been introduced as a highly capable route of administration for growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor or fibroblast growth factor. Extracorporal shock waves (ESW) deliver energy by means of high amplitudes of sound to the target tissue and have been shown to induce angiogenesis. We compared the effectiveness of gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and ESW therapy to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of 10 each with an 8 x 8 cm epigastric skin flap. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus (Ad) encoding TGF-beta (10(8) pfu) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15 mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. Flap viability was evaluated after 7 days and digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area calculated. Histologic evaluation and increased angiogenesis were confirmed by CD31 immunohistochemistry. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-beta group and the ESW group compared to the control group (ESW group: 97.7 +/- 1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-beta: 90.3 +/- 4.0% and control group: 82.6 +/- 4.3%; p < 0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-beta group (ESW group: 97.7 +/- 1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-beta: 90.3 +/- 4.0%; p < 0.05). Flap vascularization was increased by Ad-TGF-beta and ESW with numerous vessels, however, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-beta treatment and thus represents a modality that is feasible, cost-effective, and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.", "journal": "Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society", "date": "2005-06-15", "authors": ["Georg MHuemer", "RomedMeirer", "RaffiGurunluoglu", "Florian SKamelger", "Karin MDunst", "SiegmundWanner", "HildegundePiza-Katzer"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1067-1927.2005.130308.x"}

Better criteria are therefore necessary to establish the viability of a transferable embryo. Early prognosis of the developmental fate of the oocyte would help in selecting the best embryos to transfer, but non-invasive selection at the oocyte stage (extracytoplasmic and intracytoplasmic morphology) has proved to be of little prognostic value. Recently, it has been shown that follicular vascularization appears to be predictive of oocyte developmental fate, making it a good first-step approach for selection. Observation of pronuclei patterns at the zygote stage appears to offer an additional prognostic tool, correlating well with IVF outcome. Morphological evaluation of the embryo at days 2-3 remains the most used and valid method of selection, even though it is not sufficient to select embryos with the higher implantation potential. Blastocyst culture is another possible strategy for selecting the best embryos with reduced risk of aneuploidies, though not all major chromosomal aberrations are excluded by prolonged in-vitro culture.

The purpose of intervention is to allow a cartilage-wrapped bone to heal and maintain a smooth articular surface. Proposed treatment options for scaphoid nonunions have varied success rates. Using the Mack-Lichtman classification for nonunions, a plan can be formulated for individual patients based on motion loss, degenerative changes, carpal collapse, and fracture instability manifested by bone loss. Stable nonunions may benefit from bone grafting and internal fixation. Unstable nonunions require grafting and fixation. With the development of arthritis, grafting and fixation must be weighed against suitability of a proximal row carpectomy or a four-corner fusion with scaphoid excision. Advanced carpal collapse and arthritis mandates fusion, either limited or complete. CT allows preoperative planning to assess grafting requirements. MRI defines vascular supply fa vascular graft is considered. Vascularized graft options have multiplied as attention has been focused on the impact of improved blood supply on the avascular scaphoid. Patient- and fracture-specific factors are important considerations when determining surgical options; underestimating their importance can compromise surgical results even with a high level of technical skill.

Its cyclic growth and development takes place under the influence of gonadotropic hormones. If pregnancy does occur, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) takes over the function of luteinizing hormone (LH) and, in contrast to LH, extends the functional life span of the CL. In this study, we investigated the effects of hCG and LH in a spheroidal cell culture model of CL development. Our data indicate that GCs secrete factors under the control of hCG that increase sprout formation of EC-spheroids. We demonstrate that the most prominent of these factors is VEGF-A. Furthermore, we found that both LH and hCG decrease sprout formation of GC-spheroids. After forming EC-GC coculture spheroids and consequently bringing GCs and ECs in close contact, sprouting increased under the influence of hCG, however not under LH. These experiments provide evidence for an hCG dependent functional switch in the GCs after coming in contact with ECs. Moreover, it demonstrates the considerably different effects of hCG and LH on GCs although their signaling is transmitted via the same receptor.", "journal": "Molecular reproduction and development", "date": "2005-06-11", "authors": ["AWalz", "CKeck", "HWeber", "CKissel", "DPietrowski"], "doi": "10.1002/mrd.20325"}

The differentiation of stem cells after leaving their niches depends predominately on the local milieu and its new microenvironment, and is facilitated by soluble factors but also by the close cell-cell interaction in a three-dimensional tissue or organ system. We have isolated CD34-negative, mesenchymal stem cell lines from human bone marrow and peripheral blood and generated monoclonal cell populations after immortalization with the SV40 large T-antigen. The cultivation of those adult stem cell clones in an especially designed in vitro environment, including self-constructed glass capillaries with defined growth conditions, leads to the spontaneous establishment of pleomorphic three-dimensional cell aggregates (spheroids) from the monoclonal cell population, which consist of cells with an osteoblast phenotype and areas of mineralization along with well-vascularized tissue areas. Modifications of the culture conditions favored areas of bone-like calcifications. After the transplantation of the at least partly mineralized human spheroids into different murine soft tissue sites but also a dorsal skinfold chamber, no further bone formation could be observed, but angiogenesis and neovessel formation prevailed instead, enabling the transplanted cells and cell aggregates to survive.

The small, pale tumors of antibody treated animals consisted of degenerate hyaline material with remnant nests of leukemic cells, whereas large tumors showed sheets of leukemic cells and numerous blood vessels. Specimens processed for CD31 antigen showed scarce or absence of blood vessels in the small, pale tumors in contrast to intensive staining from a rich network of blood vessels in the large, highly vascularized tumors.

These responses include increases in glycolytic activity, vascularization, breathing, and red blood cell production. These responses are mediated in part by the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which receive information on O2 levels from a group of iron- and O2-dependent hydroxylases. Hypoxia mimics, such as cobalt chloride, nickel chloride, and deferoxamine, act to simulate hypoxia by altering the iron status of these hydroxylases. To determine whether these mimics are appropriate substitutes for the lower O2 tension evoked naturally, we compared transcriptional responses of a Hep3B cell line using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. A battery of core genes was identified that was shared by all four treatments (hypoxia, cobalt, nickel, and deferoxamine) including glycolytic enzymes, cell cycle regulators, and apoptotic genes. Importantly, cobalt, nickel, and deferoxamine influenced transcription of distinct sets of genes that were not affected by cellular hypoxia. These global responses to hypoxia indicate a balancing act between adaptation and programmed cell death and suggest caution in the use of hypoxia mimics as substitutes for the low O2 tension that occurs in vivo.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2005-06-09", "authors": ["AVengellur", "J MPhillips", "J BHogenesch", "J JLaPres"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00045.2004"}

In human tumors, Ets-1 is expressed in endothelial cells and fibroblasts of the tumor stroma and is proposed to play a role in tumor vascularization and invasion by upregulating expression of matrix-degrading proteases. In human carcinomas, Ets-1 is also expressed by neoplastic cells, but little is known about the functional implications of this observation. We have addressed the role of Ets-1 in epithelial HeLa tumor cells by selecting stably Ets-1 over and underexpressing HeLa cells. Ets-1 expression increases the transformed phenotype of HeLa cells, by promoting cell migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth, while Ets-1 downregulation reduces cell attachment. In correlation with these results, Ets-1 upregulation increases integrinbeta2 expression but not that of other integrins.

Vascularization within the developing mouse neural tube depends on vessel sprouting from the surrounding vascular plexus. Previous studies implicated possible roles of VEGF/Flk-1 and Angiopoietin-1(Ang-1)/Tie-2 signaling as candidate molecules functioning in this process. Examining gene expressions of these factors at embryonic day (E) 9.5 and 10.5, we unexpectedly found that both VEGF and Ang-1 were expressed in the motor neurons in the ventral neural tube. The motor neurons were indeed located in the close vicinity of the infiltrating vessels, suggesting involvement of motor neurons in the sprouting. To substantiate this possibility, we inhibited induction of the motor neurons in the cultured mouse embryos by cyclopamine, a Shh signaling blocker. The vessel sprouting was dramatically impaired by inhibition of Shh signaling, together with nearly complete loss of the motor neurons. Expression of Ang-1, but not VEGF, within the neural tube was remarkably reduced in the cyclopamine treated embryos.

We have shown that addition of low-dose tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to systemic Doxil administration dramatically improved tumor response in the highly vascularized rat soft tissue sarcoma BN175. Whether a similar enhanced efficacy can be achieved in less vascularized tumors is uncertain. We therefore examined the effect of systemic administration of Doxil in combination with low-dose TNF in intermediate vascularized osteosarcoma-bearing rats (ROS-1). Small fragments of the osteosarcoma were implanted s.c. in the lower limb. Treatment was started when the tumors reached an average diameter of 1 cm. Rats were treated with five i.v. injections at 4-day intervals with Doxil or doxorubicin and TNF. Systemic treatment with Doxil resulted in a better tumor growth delay than free doxorubicin, but with progressive diseases in all animals. The 3.5-fold augmented accumulation of Doxil compared to free doxorubicin presumably explains the enhanced tumor regression. Addition of low-dose TNF augmented the anti-tumor activity of Doxil, although no increased drug uptake was found compared to Doxil alone. In vitro studies showed that ROS-1 is sensitive to TNF, but systemic treatment with TNF alone did not result in a tumor growth delay. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment with Doxil alone or with TNF resulted in massive coagulative necrosis of tumor tissue.

We used this model to compute the spatial distribution of the microspheres that lodge in capillaries. We used the distribution model as input to a finite-element heat transfer model of the FEH treatment. The overall appearance of the vascular tree is subjectively similar to that of the disorganized vascular network which encapsulates tumours. The microspheres are distributed in the tumour periphery in similar patterns to experimental observations.

In some groups, a vascularized periosteal flap was harvested from the medial surface of the tibia. In group 1, the femoral defects in the animals were filled with the OPLA-HY matrix alone; in group 2, the OPLA-HY matrix was covered by the vascularized periosteal flap; in group 3, 20 mug of rhBMP-2 was added to the OPLA-HY matrix; and in group 4, the femoral defect containing the OPLA-HY matrix and 20 mug of rhBMP-2 was wrapped circumferentially by the vascularized periosteal flap. The presence and density of new bone formation in the femoral defect were evaluated radiographically, histologically, and with histomorphometry at four and eight weeks postoperatively.\nGroups 1 and 2, which were not treated with rhBMP-2, showed no radiographic or histologic evidence of mature bone formation at four or eight weeks. Both groups 3 and 4, which were treated with rhBMP-2, demonstrated excellent bone formation.

{"title": "The yin and yang of corpus luteum-derived endothelial cells: balancing life and death.", "abstract": "A dense network of capillaries irrigates the corpus luteum (CL) allowing an intricate cross talk between luteal steroiodgenic and endothelial cell (EC) types. Indeed, luteal endothelial cells (LEC) play pivotal roles throughout the entire CL life-span. Microvascular endothelial cells are locally specialized to accommodate the needs of individual tissues, therefore unraveling the characteristics of LEC is imperative in CL physiology. Numerous studies demonstrated that endothelium-derived endothelin-1 (ET-1) is upregulated by the luteolytic hormone-prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) and functions as an important element of the luteolytic cascade. To have a better insight on its synthesis and action, members of ET system (ET-1, ET converting enzyme -ECE-1 and ET(A) and ET(B) receptors) were quantified in LEC. The characteristic phenotype of these cells, identified by high ET-1 receptor expression (both ET(A), ET(B)) and low ET-1 and ECE-1 levels, was gradually lost during culture suggesting that luteal microenvironment sustains the selective phenotype of its resident endothelial cells. Proper vascularization and endothelial cell activity per se are essential for normal CL function. Therefore, factors affecting vascular growth are expected to play major role in the regulation of luteal function. Concomitantly with the angiogenic process, luteal PGF2alpha and its receptors (PGFR) are induced and maintained during most of the CL life-span, suggesting a possible role of PGF2alpha in LEC proliferation and function. Dispersed LEC expressed PGFR and incubation with the prostaglandin stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. PGF2alpha activated p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation also in long-term cultured LEC. In this cell type, PGF2alpha increased cell number, 3H-Thymidine incorporation and cell survival. Additionally, PGF2alpha rapidly and transiently stimulated the expression of immediate-early response genes, i.e. c-fos and c-jun mRNA, further suggesting a mitogenic effect for this prostaglandin in LEC. These data imply that PGF2alpha may assume different and perhaps opposing roles depending on luteal microenvironment.", "journal": "Domestic animal endocrinology", "date": "2005-06-02", "authors": ["RinaMeidan", "NitzanLevy", "TaniaKisliouk", "LenaPodlovny", "MayaRusiansky", "EyalKlipper"], "doi": "10.1016/j.domaniend.2005.04.003"}
{"title": "[Overload damage to the Achilles tendon: the importance of vascularization and angiogenesis].", "abstract": "In the Achilles tendon, degenerative changes mostly occur in regions that are hypo- or avascular. Angiogenesis is mediated by angiogenic factors and recent studies have shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is highly expressed in degenerative Achilles tendons, whereas VEGF expression is nearly completely downregulated in healthy tendons. VEGF expression in tendon fibroblasts is regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Several factors are able to upregulate VEGF expression in tenocytes: hypoxia, inflammatory cytokines and mechanical load. Angiogenesis plays an important role in the tendinotic process. The neovessels are accompanied by small glutamate positive neural structures. This finding suggests that angiogenesis plays an important role in the pain experienced during the degenerative tendon disease. On the other hand, there is some evidence that HIF-1/VEGF induced angiogenesis has an effect on the material properties of the tendinotic tendon tissue. Since VEGF has the potential to stimulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and inhibits the expression of tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) in various cell types this cytokine might play a significant role in the pathogenetic processes during degenerative tendon disease. These experimental findings are in accordance with clinical results which show that eccentric training leads to a regression of neovessels and decrease of pain.

During circumscribing incision mucosal collars were preserved and used to create a normal appearing circumcision line. A ventral based vascular dartos tissue was preserved as a flap and used as a second layer to cover the entire neourethra before glans closure.\nAll repairs were completed in 1 stage. Mean follow-up was 10.5 months (3-37 months). There were 5 (8.3%) cases of fistula and 6 (10%) cases of meatal stenosis. All patients with fistula formation had meatal stenosis. All patients, except for patients with fistula and/or metal stenosis, were voiding a straight stream and have a slit like meatus with cosmetically normal looking circumcised penis.\nVentral based flaps are easier to harvest and transpose to cover the neourethra.

{"title": "DRP1A is responsible for vascular continuity synergistically working with VAN3 in Arabidopsis.", "abstract": "In most dicotyledonous plants, vascular tissues in the leaf have a reticulate venation pattern. We have isolated and characterized an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant defective in the vascular network defective mutant, van3. van3 mutants show a discontinuous vascular pattern, and VAN3 is known to encode an ADP-ribosylation-factor-GTPase-activating protein that regulates membrane trafficking in the trans-Golgi network. To elucidate the molecular nature controlling the vein patterning process through membrane trafficking, we searched VAN3-interacting proteins using a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two hybrid system. As a result, we isolated the plant Dynamin-Related Protein 1A (DRP1A) as a VAN3 interacting protein. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of DRP1AGUS and VAN3GUS were very similar. The subcellular localization of VAN3 completely overlapped to that of DRP1A. drp1a showed a disconnected vascular network, and the drp1a mutation enhanced the phenotype of vascular discontinuity of the van3 mutant in the drp1a van3 double mutant. Furthermore, the drp1 mutation enhanced the discontinuous vascular pattern of the gnom mutant, which had the same effect as that of the van3 mutation. These results indicate that DRP1 modulates the VAN3 function in vesicle budding from the trans-Golgi network, which regulates vascular formation in Arabidopsis.", "journal": "Plant physiology", "date": "2005-06-01", "authors": ["ShinichiroSawa", "KojiKoizumi", "SatoshiNaramoto", "TakuDemura", "TakashiUeda", "AkihikoNakano", "HirooFukuda"], "doi": "10.1104/pp.105.061689"}

Hysteroscopic detection of focal or extensive endometrial thickening, irregular vascular network, architectural distortion and crowding of gland openings, and gland cyst formation were considered endoscopic features consistent with hyperplasia. Overall sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values (NPV), and positive predictive values (PPV) of hysteroscopy in order to foresee a diagnosis of hyperplasia were calculated. These figures were calculated both in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients.

However, the role of the material in control and guidance of their development and commitment into complex and viable three-dimensional (3D) tissues is still poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the role of material composition and structure on promoting ES cells growth and differentiation, by culturing mouse ES cell-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) in various semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs), made of collagen, fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LM). We show that both composition and strength of the supportive matrix play an important role in EBs development. High collagen concentrations inhibit EBs cavitation and hence the following EBs differentiation, by inhibiting apoptosis. The presence of FN in 3D collagen constructs strongly stimulates endothelial cell differentiation and vascularization. Conversely, LM increases the ability of ES cells to differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes. Our data suggest that matrix composition has an important role in EBs development and that it is possible to influence stem cell differentiation toward preferential pattern, by modulating the physical and biochemical properties of the scaffold.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2005-06-01", "authors": ["SabrinaBattista", "DanielaGuarnieri", "CristinaBorselli", "StefaniaZeppetelli", "AssuntaBorzacchiello", "LauraMayol", "DiegoGerbasio", "Douglas RKeene", "LuigiAmbrosio", "Paolo ANetti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.04.003"}

In contrast, no adhesion to the visceral organs was observed for the AGP patch. Histologically, inflammatory cells were found mainly surrounding the GP patch. In contrast, host cells (inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and neo-capillaries) were able to infiltrate into the AGA and AGP patches. Unlike the AGA patch, the AGP patch retrieved at 1-month post-operatively became well integrated with the host tissue near the suture line. Additionally, there were some mesothelial cells, identified by the van Gieson stain, observed on the AGP patch. At 3-month post-operatively, a neo-peritoneum was observed on the AGP patch. The neo-peritoneum consisted of organized vascularized connective tissues covered by an intact layer of mesothelial cells. The calcium contents of the polypropylene mesh and the AGA patch increased significantly at 3-month post-operatively, while those of the GP and AGP patches stayed minimal throughout the entire course of the study.\nThe results obtained in the study revealed that the AGP patch effectively repaired abdominal wall defects in rats and successfully prevented the formation of post-surgical abdominal adhesions.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2005-06-01", "authors": ["Po-HongLai", "YenChang", "Huang-ChienLiang", "Sung-ChingChen", "Hao-JiWei", "Hsing-WenSung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2005.03.016"}
{"title": "Endothelial cell pseudopods and angiogenesis of breast cancer tumors.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A neoplastic tumor cannot grow beyond a millimeter or so in diameter without recruitment of endothelial cells and new blood vessels to supply nutrition and oxygen for tumor cell survival. This study was designed to investigate formation of new blood vessels within a human growing breast cancer tumor model (MDA MB231 in mammary fat pad of nude female mouse). Once the tumor grew to 35 mm3, it developed a well-vascularized capsule. Histological sections of tumors greater than 35 mm3 were stained with PAS, with CD-31 antibody (an endothelial cell maker), or with hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha antibody (HIF). The extent of blood vessel and endothelial cell pseudopod volume density was measured by ocular grid intercept counting in the PAS stained slides. RESULTS: The tumor area within 100-150 mum of the well-vascularized capsule had few blood vessels and only occasional endothelial cell pseudopods, whereas the area greater than 150 mum from the capsule had more blood vessels, capillaries, and a three-fold increase in volume density of pseudopods sprouting from the capillary endothelial cells. This subcortical region, rich in pseudopods, some of which were observed to have vacuoles/lumens, was strongly positive for presence of HIF. In some larger tumors, pseudopods were observed to insinuate for mm distances through hypoxic regions of the tumor. CONCLUSION: The positive correlation between presence of HIF and the increased extent of pseudopods suggests volume density measure of the latter as a quantifiable marker of tumor hypoxia. Apparently, hypoxic regions of the tumor produce HIF leading to production of vascular endothelial growth factors that stimulate sprouting of capillary endothelial cells and formation of endothelial cell pseudopods.", "journal": "Cancer cell international", "date": "2005-05-28", "authors": ["Ivan LCameron", "NicholasShort", "LuzheSun", "W ElaineHardman"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-2867-5-17\n10.1002/aja.1000520102\n10.1038/74651\n10.1023/A:1024532022166\n10.1002/ar.1091540105\n10.1073/pnas.2436101100"}

Twenty cadaver lower limbs were cut into sagittal, coronal, or axial sections after the injection of a red-colored gelatin solution. Ten anatomical samples were selected for histology. Then 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled in a contrast-enhanced ultrasonography study (CUS). Calcaneal tendon and plantar aponeurosis entheses were studied first without any contrast-agent (B-mode, power Doppler). A single dose (2.4 ml) of the contrast agent was then administered for studying each enthesis of the right foot. The operators had to look for blood flow within the entheses and in the adjacent soft tissues. Anastomotic transverse branches were seen macroscopically at the back of the calcaneal tendon, giving some capillaries penetrating the enthesis. None of these vessels could be seen with CUS. In contrast, a high-density vascular network could be detected in Kager's triangle with CUS. No blood vessel could be seen within the plantar aponeurosis enthesis, either macroscopically or microscopically. No evidence of entheseal vascularization was found with any contrast-enhanced imaging technique. Inferior branches of the lateral plantar artery were seen on coronal and sagittal sections of the hindfoot, and could be detected with CUS. These arterioles were running toward the anterior aspect of the calcaneal tuberosity, near the plantar aponeurosis insertion. In conclusion, no vascularization was detected with CUS at the cortical bone insertion of normal heel entheses. However, some vascularization could be seen in the immediate vicinity of heel entheses.

In this study we compared the ability of the four EETs (5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs) to regulate endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo and determined the molecular mechanism by which EETs control these events. Inhibition of the epoxygenase blocked serum-induced endothelial cell proliferation, and exogenously added EETs rescued cell proliferation from epoxygenase inhibition. Studies with selective ERK, p38 MAPK, or PI3K inhibitors revealed that whereas activation of p38 MAPK is required for the proliferative responses to 8,9- and 11,12-EET, activation of PI3K is necessary for the cell proliferation induced by 5,6- and 14,15-EET. Among the four EETs, only 5,6- and 8,9-EET are capable of promoting endothelial cell migration and the formation of capillary-like structures, events that are dependent on EET-mediated activation of ERK and PI3K. Using subcutaneous sponge models, we showed that 5,6- and 8,9-EET are pro-angiogenic in mice and that their neo-vascularization effects are enhanced by the co-administration of an inhibitor of EET enzymatic hydration, presumably because of reduced EET metabolism and inactivation. These studies identify 5,6- and 8,9-EET as powerful and selective angiogenic lipids, provide a functional link between the EET proliferative chemotactic properties and their angiogenic activity, and suggest a physiological role for them in angiogenesis and de novo vascularization.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2005-05-27", "authors": ["AmbraPozzi", "InesMacias-Perez", "TristinAbair", "ShouzuoWei", "YanSu", "RoyZent", "John RFalck", "Jorge HCapdevila"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M501730200"}

Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated the records of all patients admitted to the University Hospital of Geneva from January 1999 through October 2004, with diagnoses of severe foot infection (+/- osteomyelitis) documented during surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-five severe diabetic foot infections were identified, 21 with osteomyelitis. The most common risk factors were age older than 60 years (n=10), chronic renal failure (n=7), severe arteriopathy (n=6), and immune depression (n=2). Most lesions were classified as grade 3 or 4 of Wagner's classification. 80% of the surgical samples were polymicrobial. Blood cultures were positive in 4 patients, one in septic shock.

At dpD, the vascular distribution in most of CCRs (11/14) was classified as pattern 3 or 4 (peripheral and mixed penetrating/peripheral, respectively) and was significantly different in respect to AMLs, that showed patterns 1 and 2 (intratumoral focal and penetrating, respectively), in respect to other types of lesions, that were with prevalent pattern 2, and in respect of indeterminate lesions, that presented all patterns (from 1 to 4). The SPV was more elevated in CCRs than in all other types of lesions.

{"title": "Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the mouse embryo studied using quail/mouse chimeras.", "abstract": "Using quail/chick chimeras, we have previously shown that different embryonic territories are vascularized through two distinct mecanisms, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis occurs in tissues of somatopleural origin, vasculogenesis occurs in territories of splanchnopleural origin. The aim of this work was to establish if these modes of vascularization were conserved in the mammalian embryo. Since in vivo manipulations with mammalian embryos are difficult to perform, we used a quail/mouse chimera approach. Mouse limb buds of somatopleural origin, and visceral organ rudiments of splanchnopleural origin, were grafted into the coelomic cavity of 2.5 day-old quail embryos. After four to seven days, the hosts were killed and the origin of the endothelial cells in the mouse tissues was determined by double staining with the quail endothelial and hematopoietic cell-specific marker, QH1 and mouse-specific VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 probes. Our findings show that the great majority of vessels which developed in the mouse limbs was QH1+, indicating that these tissues were vascularized by angiogenesis. Conversely, visceral organs were vascularized through the vasculogenesis process by mouse endothelial cells which differentiated in situ. These results demonstrate for the first time that in the mouse embryo, as previously shown in avian species, the tissues from somatopleural origin are vascularized by angiogenesis, while rudiments of a splanchnopleural origin are vascularized by vasculogenesis, both at vascular and lymphatic levels.", "journal": "The International journal of developmental biology", "date": "2005-05-21", "authors": ["MichelPudliszewski", "LucPardanaud"], "doi": "10.1387/ijdb.041956mp"}

In this study, we tested the hypothesis of utilizing gene transfer via replication-competent retroviral (RCR) vectors for chronic protein delivery. We now show that bioactive human interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP10) can be secreted from a variety of mammalian cells upon transduction with RCR vectors carrying the human IP10 gene. The production of IP10 from RCR-transduced cells could be maintained for at least three months in culture. The level and duration of IP10 expression in vivo was sufficient to inhibit growth of subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors as well as metastatic lesions in mice. This tumor inhibition was correlated to a marked reduction in tumor vascularization and mitotic activity. By conducting immunohistological studies, we have been able to show that IP10 vector-affected tumors evidenced elevated levels of IL-12p35 mRNA, with no sign of changes in the local inflammatory response, however, as determined by macrophage infiltration and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.

To explore the mechanisms of this observation, we analyzed the development and distribution of regulatory T cells (Treg), which play an important protective role against allograft rejection in transplantation tolerance. Alloantigen-specific tolerance was induced using either anti-CD2 plus anti-CD3 mAbs, or anti-CD40L mAbs plus donor-specific transfusion, in fully mismatched (BALB/c donor, C57BL/6 recipient) vascularized cardiac allografts. An expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD62L(high) T cells was observed specifically within the LN of tolerant animals, but not in other anatomic sites or under nontolerizing conditions. These cells exhibited a substantial up-regulation of Foxp3 expression as measured by real-time PCR and by fluorescent immunohistochemistry, and possessed alloantigen-specific suppressor activity. Neither LN nor other lymphoid cells expressed the regulatory phenotype if recipients were treated with anti-CD62L mAbs, which both prevented LN homing and caused early allograft rejection. However, administration of FTY720, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that induces CD62L-independent T cell accumulation in the LNs, restored CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg in the LNs along with graft survival. These data suggest that alloantigen-specific Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg develop and are required within the LNs during tolerization, and provide compelling evidence that distinct lymphoid compartments play critical roles in transplantation tolerance.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2005-05-21", "authors": ["Jordi COchando", "Adam CYopp", "YuYang", "AlexandreGarin", "YansuiLi", "PeterBoros", "JaimeLlodra", "YaozhongDing", "Sergio ALira", "Nancy RKrieger", "Jonathan SBromberg"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.174.11.6993"}

Wound dehiscence may lead to devastating complications. In this paper, the efficacy of the bilateral modified V-Y advancement flap procedure was investigated in terms of simplicity, donor-site morbidity, and reliability.\nThe authors presented 10 neonates treated with a modified subcutaneous advancement procedure. Unlike the typical V-Y advancement techniques, the apical extensions of the \"V\" flaps were elevated based on the paraspinous perforators. A standard closure algorithm was not followed, as the well-vascularized apical extensions facilitated intraoperative decision making for the most appropriate adaptation pattern, depending on the size, shape, and localization of the defect. As well as that, transposition of these apical flaps to the defect site was further supported by the advancement of the V-Y flaps to decrease the tension along the closure.\nMean follow-up period was 13.6 months (range 3-37 months), and no complications that might be attributable to the operative procedure were observed.\nUtilization of bilateral modified V-Y flaps for the closure of large meningomyelocele defects is a simple and effective procedure.

Of particular importance to this vascular remodeling process is the requirement of the Tek/Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase.

To identify the underlying genetic mechanisms regulating the process of vascular remodeling, transcriptomes modulated by Tie2 signaling were analyzed utilizing serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). Two libraries were constructed and sequenced using embryonic day 8.5 yolk sac tissues from Tie2 wild-type and the Tie2-null littermates. After tag extraction, 45,689 and 45,275 SAGE tags were obtained for the Tie2 wild-type and Tie2-null libraries, respectively, yielding a total of 21,376 distinct tags.

To investigate the role of Vhl in cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis, we utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), a common tool for analyzing cell cycle regulation, and generated Vhl(-)(/)(-) MEF-derived fibrosarcomas. Surprisingly, growth of both Vhl(-)(/)(-) MEFs and fibrosarcomas was impaired, although tumor vascularity was increased. Decreased proliferation of Vhl(-)(/)(-) MEFs was correlated with an overexpression of cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21 and p27. The transcription of p21 and p27 is inhibited by c-Myc; therefore, the induction of CKIs was attributed to the ability of HIF to antagonize c-Myc activity. Indeed, p21 mRNA levels were elevated under normoxia in Vhl(-)(/)(-) MEFs, while c-Myc transcriptional activity was markedly reduced. Gene silencing of HIF-1alpha by small interfering RNA reduced p21 and p27 protein and mRNA levels in Vhl(-)(/)(-) MEFs. The induction of p21 and p27, mediated by constitutive activation of the HIF pathway, provides a mechanism for the decreased proliferation rates of Vhl(-)(/)(-) MEFs and fibrosarcomas.

Neovascularization is a common feature also of disc herniation. Intervertebral disc aggrecan is inhibitory to sensory nerve growth, but the effects of disc aggrecan on endothelial cell growth are not known.\nAggrecan monomers were isolated separately from the anulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus of human lumbar intervertebral discs, and characterized to determine the amount and type of sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains present.

In an animal model of cisplatin-induced neuropathy, nerve blood flow was markedly attenuated, and there was a profound reduction in the number of vasa nervorum associated with marked endothelial cell apoptosis, resulting in a severe peripheral neuropathy with focal axonal degeneration characteristic of ischemic neuropathy. After intramuscular gene transfer of naked plasmid DNA encoding VEGF-1 in animals with an established neuropathy, vascularity and blood flow returned to levels similar to those of control rats, peripheral nerve function was restored, and histological nerve architecture was normalized.

Leaves treated with chemical inhibitors of polar auxin transport exhibited vascular phenotypes that include increased vein thickness and vascularization. We describe a recessive mutant, thickvein (tkv), which develops thicker veins in leaves and in inflorescence stems. The increased vein thickness is attributable to an increased number of vascular cells. Mutant plants have smaller leaves and shorter inflorescence stems, and this reduction in organ size and height is accompanied by an increase in organ vascularization, which appears to be attributable to an increase in the recruitment of cells into veins. Furthermore, although floral development is normal, auxin transport in the inflorescence stem is significantly reduced in the mutant, suggesting that the defect in auxin transport is responsible for the vascular phenotypes. In the primary root, the veins appear morphologically normal, but root growth in the tkv mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin. The tkv mutation was found to reside in the ACL5 gene, which encodes a spermine synthase and whose expression is specific to provascular cells.

Levels of angiogenic chemokines, CC chemokine ligand 2/murine homologue of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and CXC chemokine ligand 1-3/keratinocyte-derived chemokine, were significantly lower in TNFR1-deficient mice at days 1 and 7 after implantation, respectively. These observations suggest that TNFR1-mediated signals have a critical role in sponge-induced angiogenesis, possibly by influencing the effector state of inflammatory cells and hence, modulating the angiogenic molecular network.", "journal": "Journal of leukocyte biology", "date": "2005-05-17", "authors": ["L SBarcelos", "ATalvani", "A STeixeira", "L QVieira", "G DCassali", "S PAndrade", "M MTeixeira"], "doi": "10.1189/jlb.1104682"}
{"title": "Functional expression of particular isoforms of excitatory amino acid transporters by rodent cartilage.", "abstract": "In the present study, we have attempted to demonstrate functional expression by the rodent cartilage of particular isoforms of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) essentially required for central glutamatergic signal termination. Constitutive expression of mRNA was shown for the first time with the neuronal EAAT subtype excitatory amino acid carrier-1 (EAAC1), in addition to glial subtypes such as glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), in rat costal chondrocytes cultured for 7-21 days on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Western blotting analysis confirmed the expression of corresponding proteins for both GLAST and GLT-1 in cultured chondrocytes. The accumulation of [(3)H]glutamate (Glu) occurred in a temperature- and sodium-dependent manner with biochemical and pharmacological profiles similar to those seen for brain EAATs in chondrocytes cultured for 7 days, while [(3)H]Glu accumulation consisted of a single component with a K(m) of 39.1+/-2.3 microM and a V(max) of 1320+/-120pmol/mg protein/min, respectively. In organotypic cultured metatarsals isolated before vascularization from embryonic mice, where cells underwent maturational development from resting to proliferating, prehypertrophic, hypertrophic and calcified chondrocytes in a progressive order of cellular differentiation, moreover, mRNA expression was seen for GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAT4 but not for EAAC1 subtypes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed distribution profiles different from each other with GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAT4 isoforms in sections of cultured metatarsals and isolated tibiae. These results suggest that extracellular Glu could be cleared up into intracellular locations through particular glial and/or neuronal EAAT isoforms functionally expressed by the rodent cartilage.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2005-05-17", "authors": ["EiichiHinoi", "LiyangWang", "AkihiroTakemori", "YukioYoneda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2005.04.025"}

In all children, a standard tubularized incised-plate urethroplasty was followed by reconstruction of new surrounding urethral tissue. A longitudinal dartos flap was harvested from excessive dorsal preputial and penile hypospadiac skin, and transposed to the ventral side by a buttonhole manoeuvre; it was sutured to the glans wings around the neomeatus, and to the corpora cavernosa over the neourethra. Thus the neourethra was completely covered with well-vascularized subcutaneous tissue.\nAt a mean (range) follow-up of 21 (6-65) months, the result was successful, with no fistula or urethral stenosis, in all 67 children.\nWe suggest that urethral covering should be part of the Snodgrass procedure.

Genetic ablation of COUP-TFII results in early embryonic lethality and demonstrates that this gene is required for cardiac and vascular development. Expression of COUP-TFII persists throughout postnatal life in various tissues including the female reproductive tract. However, the physiological function of COUP-TFII in female reproduction has not been extensively analyzed. Here, we provide phenotypic evidences that haploinsufficiency of COUP-TFII in mice demonstrates an important role of COUP-TFII for normal female reproduction. COUP-TFII +/- females show significantly reduced fecundity, irregular estrus cycles, delayed puberty, and retarded postnatal growth. Analysis of the reduced fertility revealed that although ovarian function was normal with respect to ovulation, the ovaries have reduced ability to synthesize progesterone in response to exogenous gonadotropins. This reduction is due to the reduction of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes important for progesterone synthesis and the reduction of vascularization in COUP-TFII heterozygotes. Analysis of uterine function demonstrated a reduced response to an experimentally induced decidual cell reaction indicating that the ability of the uterus to support embryo implantation was reduced. Taken together, our data show global impact of gene dosage effects of COUP-TFII on female postnatal life and indicates requirement of COUP-TFII in normal female reproduction, in particular for uterine endometrial functions during the peri-implantation period.", "journal": "Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)", "date": "2005-05-14", "authors": ["NorioTakamoto", "IsaoKurihara", "KevinLee", "Francesco JDemayo", "Ming-JerTsai", "Sophia YTsai"], "doi": "10.1210/me.2005-0019"}

{"title": "Initial vascularization and tissue differentiation are influenced by fixation stability.", "abstract": "Fracture healing requires a certain degree of mechanical stability and an adequate blood supply. The hypothesis of the present study was that increased interfragmentary shear leads to a reduced initial vascularization and prolonged healing. The aim of the study was to quantitatively analyze the histological appearance of vascularization and tissue differentiation with regard to fracture stability during the course of healing. A mid-shaft osteotomy of the tibia was performed in two groups of sheep and stabilized with either a rigid or semirigid external fixator, differing in bending stiffness. Interfragmentary movements and ground reaction forces were evaluated in vivo during a 9-week period. The sheep were sacrificed at 2, 3, 6, and 9 weeks postoperatively. The tibiae were tested biomechanically and histological sections from the callus were prepared for analysis of tissue differentiation and vascularization. Larger interfragmentary shear movements in the semirigid fixator group were associated with a reduced initial blood supply. At 6 weeks the semirigid fixator group showed a significantly lower percentage of mineralized bone and a higher amount of fibrous tissue leading to a significantly lower stiffness of the callus than the rigid fixator group. This initial delay in healing was compensated for in the later stages with the production of greater volumes of callus tissue so that both groups showed the same callus stiffness at 9 weeks. However, the rigid fixator group showed signs of the beginning of callus remodeling at the latest time points suggesting a faster bone healing. The results indicate the important role of the initial mechanical stability specifically in the vascularization of an osteosynthesis.

{"title": "Hypoxia inducible factor pathways as targets for functional foods.", "abstract": "The etiology of most chronic angiogenic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes complications, and cancer includes the presence of pockets of hypoxic cells growing behind aerobic cells and away from blood vessels. Hypoxic cells are the result of uncontrolled growth and insufficient vascularization and have undergone a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. Cells respond to hypoxia by stimulating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which is critical for survival under hypoxic conditions and in embryogenesis. HIF is a heterodimer consisting of the O2-regulated subunit, HIF-1alpha, and the constitutively expressed aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, HIF-1beta. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1alpha is stable, accumulates, and migrates to the nucleus where it binds to HIF-1beta to form the complex (HIF-1alpha + HIF-1beta). Transcription is initiated by the binding of the complex (HIF-1alpha + HIF-1beta) to hypoxia responsive elements (HREs). The complex [(HIF-1alpha + HIF-1beta) + HREs] stimulates the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, vascular permeability, and inflammation. Experimental and clinical evidence show that these hypoxic cells are the most aggressive and difficult angiogenic disease cells to treat and are a major reason for antiangiogenic and conventional treatment failure. Hypoxia occurs in early stages of disease development (before metastasis), activates angiogenesis, and stimulates vascular remodeling. HIF-1alpha has also been identified under aerobic conditions in certain types of cancer. This review summarizes the role of hypoxia in some chronic degenerative angiogenic diseases and discusses potential functional foods to target the HIF-1alpha pathways under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. It is reported that dietary quinones, semiquinones, phenolics, vitamins, amino acids, isoprenoids, and vasoactive compounds can down-regulate the HIF-1 pathways and therefore the expression of several proangiogenic factors. Considering the lack of efficiency or the side effects of synthetic antiangiogenic drugs at clinical trials, down-regulation of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis by use of naturally occurring functional foods may provide an effective means of prevention.", "journal": "Journal of agricultural and food chemistry", "date": "2005-05-12", "authors": ["Jack NLosso", "Hiba ABawadi"], "doi": "10.1021/jf0479719"}

Intraovarian vascularization was investigated in eight ewes by using contrast-enhanced power Doppler after intravenous injection of Sonovue at five different times during each of ten normal estrous cycles. Sheep under general anesthesia underwent transvaginal B mode and power Doppler ultrasound examination of both ovaries, then received two successive doses of 5 ml of Sonovue, one dose for each ovary. Each ovary was monitored after the contrast injection, and a 3-min video clip was stored for each side. The video clip was used to derive time-intensity curves, which were then used to derive the contrast parameters. A total of 108 doses of contrast agent were used; 93% of the injections were available for contrast enhancement analysis. The optimal dose was determined on the first two sheep. Enhancement was strongest and longest with the 5-ml dose. In one sheep, enhancement of both ovaries remained weak irrespective of the period of the cycle. No adverse side effects of Sonovue were seen in the sheep. Contrast injection improved visualization of ovarian microcirculation by 248% (95% confidence interval [CI], 210 to 285%) for 74.2 sec (95% CI, 68.2 to 80.2 sec). Ovaries on the side of ovulation had a stronger enhancement compared with the ovary with no ovulation (368% versus 175%, P < 0.001), but the enhancement time was the same.

Medial chondropathy was scored by using Societe Francaise d'Arthroscopie (SFA) score (0-100) and reader's overall assessment (VAS score, 100 mm). Progression of medial chondropathy was defined by a change in SFA and VAS scores over 4.5 and 8.0 mm after 1 year, respectively. Medial perimeniscal synovium was scored as normal (few translucent and slender villi, fine vascular network), reactive (proliferation of opaque villi), or inflammatory (hypervascularization and/or proliferation of hypertrophic and hyperemic villi).

Synovial abnormalities were present in 50% of the patients with reactive and inflammatory aspects in 29% and 21% of the patients, respectively.

The worsening in medial chondropathy after 1 year was statistically more severe in the group of patients with an inflammatory perimeniscal synovial membrane at baseline compared to patients with normal and reactive aspects, with no difference between these two latter groups. The odds ratio for progression in VAS score after 1 year was 3.11 (95% CI [1.07, 5.69]) for patients with inflammatory synovium at baseline compared to patients with normal synovium.\nThis study suggests that abnormalities of the medial perimeniscal synovium are a common feature of painful medial knee OA, associated with more severe medial chondropathy.

{"title": "Encapsulation of islets in rough surface, hydroxymethylated polysulfone capillaries stimulates VEGF release and promotes vascularization after transplantation.", "abstract": "The transplantation of encapsulated islets of Langerhans is one approach to treat type 1 diabetes without the need of lifelong immunosuppression. Capillaries have been used for macroencapsulation because they have a favorable surface-to-volume ratio and because they can be refilled. It is unclear at present whether the outer surface of such capillaries should be smooth to prevent, or rough to promote, cell adhesions. In this study we tested a new capillary made of modified polysulfone (MWCO: 50 kDa) with a rough, open-porous outer surface for islet transplantation. Compared with free-floating islets, encapsulation of freshly isolated rat islets affected neither the kinetics nor the efficiency of glucose-induced insulin release in perifusion experiments. Free-floating islets maintained insulin secretion during cell culture but encapsulated islets gradually lost their glucose responsiveness and released VEGF. This indicated hypoxia in the capillary lumen. Transplantation of encapsulated rat islets into diabetic rats significantly reduced blood glucose concentrations from the first week of implantation. This hypoglycaemic effect persisted until explantation 4 weeks later. Transplantation of encapsulated porcine islets into diabetic rats reduced blood glucose concentrations depending on the islet purity. With semipurified islets a transient reduction of blood glucose concentrations was observed (2, 8, 18, 18 days) whereas with highly purified islets a sustained normoglycaemia was achieved (more than 28 days). Explanted capillaries containing rat islets were covered with blood vessels. Vascularization was also observed on capillaries containing porcine islets that were explanted from normoglycaemic rats. In contrast, on capillaries containing porcine islets that were explanted from hyperglycemic rats a fibrous capsule and lymphocyte accumulations were observed. No vascularization on the surface of transplanted capillaries was observed in the absence of islets. In conclusion, encapsulated islets can release VEGF, which appears to be an important signal for the vascularization of the capillary material. The rough, open-porous outer surface of the polysulfone capillary provides a site well suited for vascular tissue formation and may allow a prolonged islet function after transplantation.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2005-05-11", "authors": ["NLembert", "JWesche", "PPetersen", "MDoser", "PZschocke", "H DBecker", "H P TAmmon"], "doi": null}

Vascular maturation was detected in vivo by vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, measured by BOLD contrast MRI and validated by immunostaining of histologic sections to alpha-smooth muscle actin. Vascular permeability was measured in vivo by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using albumin-based contrast material and validated in histologic sections by fluorescent staining of the biotinylated contrast material. MRI as well as histologic correlation maps between vascular maturation and vascular permeability revealed a wide range of vascular phenotypes, in which the distribution of vascular maturation and vasoreactivity did not overlap spatially with reduced permeability.

Increased levels of circulating microparticles have been documented in inflammatory disorders, diabetes mellitus, and many cardiovascular diseases. Perturbations of angiogenesis play an important role in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

Herein, using the Matrigel assay of angiogenesis in vitro and a topological analysis of the capillary-like network by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we investigated the effects of EMPs on formation of the vascular network.

The effects included decreases in total capillary length (24%), number of meshes (45%), and branching points (36%) and an increase in mesh area (38%). The positional and topological order indicated that EMPs affect angiogenic parameters uniformly over the capillary network. Treatment with the cell-permeable SOD mimetic Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (Mn-TBAP) partially or completely restored all parameters of angiogenesis affected by EMPs. EMPs reduced cell proliferation rate and increased apoptosis rate in time- and dose-dependent manners, and this phenomenon was also prevented by Mn-TBAP treatment. Our data demonstrate that EMPs have considerable impact on angiogenesis in vitro and may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of diseases that are accompanied by impaired angiogenesis.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Absence of recipient CCR5 promotes early and increased allospecific antibody responses to cardiac allografts.", "abstract": "Acute rejection is mediated by T cell infiltration of allografts, but mechanisms mediating the delayed rejection of allografts in chemokine receptor-deficient recipients remain unclear. The rejection of vascularized, MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts by CCR5(-/-) recipients was investigated. Heart grafts from A/J (H-2(a)) donors were rejected by wild-type C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) recipients on day 8-10 posttransplant vs day 8-11 by CCR5(-/-) recipients. When compared with grafts from wild-type recipients, however, significant decreases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and macrophages were observed in rejecting allografts from CCR5-deficient recipients. These decreases were accompanied by significantly lower numbers of alloreactive T cells developing to IFN-gamma-, but not IL-4-producing cells in the CCR5(-/-) recipients, suggesting suboptimal priming of T cells in the knockout recipients. CCR5 was more prominently expressed on activated CD4(+) than CD8(+) T cells in the spleens of allograft wild-type recipients and on CD4(+) T cells infiltrating the cardiac allografts. Rejecting cardiac allografts from wild-type recipients had low level deposition of C3d that was restricted to the graft vessels. Rejecting allografts from CCR5(-/-) recipients had intense C3d deposition in the vessels as well as on capillaries throughout the graft parenchyma similar to that observed during rejection in donor-sensitized recipients. Titers of donor-reactive Abs in the serum of CCR5(-/-) recipients were almost 20-fold higher than those induced in wild-type recipients, and the high titers appeared as early as day 6 posttransplant. These results suggest dysregulation of alloreactive Ab responses and Ab-mediated cardiac allograft rejection in the absence of recipient CCR5.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2005-05-10", "authors": ["HiroyukiAmano", "AliceBickerstaff", "Charles GOrosz", "Andrew CNovick", "HiroshiToma", "Robert LFairchild"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6499"}

Interestingly, gamma-secretase cleaves several proteins including Notch, E-cadherin, CD44 and ErbB-4 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4), which are important modulators of angiogenesis. The beta-amyloid precursor protein, which is cleaved by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase to produce beta-amyloid, is highly expressed in the endothelium of neoforming vessels suggesting that it might play a role during angiogenesis. These data prompted us to explore the effects of beta and gamma-secretase inhibitors of different structures on angiogenesis and tumor growth. Both the gamma and beta-secretase inhibitors tested reduce endothelial cell proliferation without inducing cellular toxicity, suppress the formation of capillary structures in vitro and oppose the sprouting of microvessel outgrowths in the rat aortic ring model of angiogenesis. Moreover, they potently inhibit the growth and vascularization of human glioblastoma and human lung adenocarcinoma tumors xenotransplanted into nude mice. Altogether these data suggest that the gamma and beta-secretases play an essential role during angiogenesis and that inhibitors of the beta and gamma-secretases may constitute new classes of anti-angiogenic and anti-tumoral compounds.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2005-05-10", "authors": ["DanielParis", "AmitaQuadros", "NikunjPatel", "AnthonyDelleDonne", "JamesHumphrey", "MichaelMullan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.02.050"}

The graft-bearing kidney was, in some cases, dissected out and perfused in vitro to evaluate the effect of angiotensin II and losartan on glucose-stimulated insulin release from the grafts.\nLosartan treatment throughout the 4-week post-transplantation period had negative effects on islet revascularisation as well as on islet graft insulin release. However, administration of losartan, either intravenously or orally, after the formation of a new vascular network, improved islet graft blood perfusion. PO2 in the islet transplants was also effectively improved by the losartan treatment. Graft perfusion experiments showed a markedly better first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release in transplanted islets when exposed to losartan. In contrast, acute administration of angiotensin II decreased islet graft blood flow, PO2 and glucose-stimulated insulin release.\nThis study shows that inhibition of the islet reninangiotensin system may be a feasible strategy to increase the blood perfusion, PO2 and function within islet grafts.

While bone is a rigid structure, it is not inert, with the cells of the skeleton being able to repair damage and respond to alterations in mechanical stimuli and various endocrine agents. Several important factors related to bone physiology that could influence the success of a pharmacological treatment include heterogeneity in bone remodeling activities throughout the skeleton, differences in blood supply and local vascularization, and the \"blood-bone\" barrier. The structural qualities of bone, especially the presence of hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone mineral and the established binding of certain molecules to this mineral phase, including tetracyclines, bisphosphonates, and other chelators, provide unique opportunities to treat skeletal diseases using targeted drug delivery. Additional opportunities exist in targeting sites with contrasting bone surface activities, including surfaces that are inactive, forming new bone or being resorbed.

VEGF189 is the largest molecule with the strongest cellular binding ability, and is thought to be most potent for vascularization in various cancers. This study aims to clear the clinicopathological characteristics of VEGF189 in the pulmonary adenocarcinoma. We finely and quantitatively examined the expression of VEGF-A isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF165 and VEGF189) by real-time polymerase chain reaction in a total of 100 pulmonary adenocarcinomas resected by surgical operation. The VEGF isoform expression status was analyzed on clinicopathological features including stromal vascularization, vascular involvement, distant metastasis, lymph nodal metastasis, postoperative relapse time and prognosis of long-term observation periods. All the pulmonary adenocarcinomas showed significant expression of VEGF-A. Twenty-two cases with the adenocarcinomas overexpressing VEGF-A significantly showed earlier postoperative relapse and poorer prognosis between 5- to 15-year periods (p = 0.0093 and p = 0.0240, Kaplan Meier, log-rank test).

Therefore, comparative histochemical and biochemical studies of u-PA and the effects of amiloride were performed on rabbit corneas and tear fluid using the sensitive fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. Rabbit eyes were repeatedly irradiated with UVB for 9 days and during the irradiation topically treated with amiloride (1 mg/ml saline) or placebo (saline) (dropwise, 5 times daily). Results show that in placebo-treated eyes, UVB evoked the appearance of u-PA activity in cornea and tear fluid in early stages of irradiation, and u-PA levels increased during irradiation. Corneal epithelium was gradually lost and remnants of the epithelium as well as keratocytes in the upper part of corneal stroma showed high u-PA activity. Finally, corneas lost their epithelium completely. In corneal stroma, numerous u-PA-containing inflammatory cells were present. Corneas were vascularized. When amiloride was dropped on the eye surface on the first day of irradiation and subsequently daily until the end of the experiment, u-PA activity in both cornea and tear fluid was strongly inhibited. Corneas were covered with a continuous epithelium until the end of the experiment. The number of inflammatory cells was significantly decreased. Corneal vascularization was reduced by 50%.

In vitro, lower porosity stimulates osteogenesis by suppressing cell proliferation and forcing cell aggregation. In contrast, in vivo, higher porosity and pore size result in greater bone ingrowth, a conclusion that is supported by the absence of reports that show enhanced osteogenic outcomes for scaffolds with low void volumes. However, this trend results in diminished mechanical properties, thereby setting an upper functional limit for pore size and porosity. Thus, a balance must be reached depending on the repair, rate of remodeling and rate of degradation of the scaffold material. Based on early studies, the minimum requirement for pore size is considered to be approximately 100 microm due to cell size, migration requirements and transport. However, pore sizes >300 microm are recommended, due to enhanced new bone formation and the formation of capillaries. Because of vascularization, pore size has been shown to affect the progression of osteogenesis. Small pores favored hypoxic conditions and induced osteochondral formation before osteogenesis, while large pores, that are well-vascularized, lead to direct osteogenesis (without preceding cartilage formation). Gradients in pore sizes are recommended for future studies focused on the formation of multiple tissues and tissue interfaces. New fabrication techniques, such as solid-free form fabrication, can potentially be used to generate scaffolds with morphological and mechanical properties more selectively designed to meet the specificity of bone-repair needs.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2005-04-30", "authors": ["VassilisKarageorgiou", "DavidKaplan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.002"}

The cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of young female mice. Six weeks later, mice were randomly divided into two diet groups: 1) mice with 10% corn oil (rich in omega 6 fatty acids) in their food, 2) mice consuming a 10% fat diet that was enriched in n-3 fatty acids. After two weeks on the diet, treatment with 200 cGy of IR every second day for four treatments (total 800 cGy) was initiated on half of the mice from each diet group. Some mice in each of the 4 groups were euthanized 24 hours after the end of IR while the remaining mice were followed for 3 additional weeks. Tumor sections were stained for endothelial cells with CD31 and PAS and for hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-\u03b1).\nThe tumor cortex within 100 microns of the well-vascularized capsule had little vascularization. Blood vessels, capillaries, and endothelial pseudopods were found at areas greater than 100 microns from the capsule (subcortex). Mice on the corn oil diet and treated with IR 24 hours previously or non-irradiated mice fed the n-3 diet had tumors with fewer blood vessels in the subcortex and more endothelial pseudopods projecting into hypoxic (HIF- \u03b1 positive) areas than did mice from the non-irradiated corn oil fed group. The tumor growth rate of mice that received IR or that were fed the n-3 fatty acid enriched diet was significantly slower than in the mice fed the 10% corn oil diet. Harmful side effects were found only in the IR treated mice.\nThe omega-3 fatty acid enriched diet proved to be a safe means for retarding tumor growth and vascularization.", "journal": "Cancer cell international", "date": "2005-04-30", "authors": ["W ElaineHardman", "LuZheSun", "NicholasShort", "Ivan LCameron"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-2867-5-12\n10.1002/ijc.10130\n10.1016/S0304-3835(99)00396-1\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6690713\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6600175\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6690654\n10.1186/bcr789\n10.1186/1475-2867-2-10\n10.1016/S0304-3835(98)00171-2\n10.1002/ijc.11725"}
{"title": "Ventricle and outflow tract of the African lungfish Protopterus dolloi.", "abstract": "We report a morphologic study of the heart ventricle and outflow tract of the African lungfish Protopterus dolloi. The ventricle is saccular and appears attached to the anterior pericardial wall by a thick tendon. An incomplete septum divides the ventricle into two chambers. Both the free ventricular wall and the incomplete ventricular septum are entirely trabeculated. Only a thin rim of myocardium separates the trabecular system from the subepicardial space. The outflow tract consists of proximal, middle, and distal portions, separated by two flexures, proximal and distal. The proximal outflow tract portion is endowed with a layer of compact, well-vascularized myocardium. This portion is homologous to the conus arteriosus observed in the heart of most vertebrates. The middle and distal outflow tract portions are arterial-like, thus being homologous to the bulbus arteriosus. However, the separation between the muscular and arterial portions of the outflow tract is not complete in the lungfish. A thin layer of myocardium covers the arterial tissue, and a thin layer of elastic tissue underlies the conus myocardium. Two unequal ridges composed of loose connective tissue, the spiral and bulbar folds, run the length of the outflow tract. They form an incomplete division of the outflow tract, but fuse at the distal end. The two folds are covered by endocardium and contain collagen, elastin, and fibroblast-like cells. They appear to be homologous to the dextro-dorsal and sinistro-ventral ridges observed during the development of the avian and mammalian heart. Two to three rows of vestigial arterial-like valves appear in the dorsal and ventral aspects of the conus. These valves are unlikely to have a functional role.

The air capillaries (ACs) are rather rotund structures that interconnect via short, narrow passageways, and the blood capillaries (BCs) comprise proliferative segments of rather uniform dimensions. The ACs and BCs anastomose profusely and closely intertwine with each other, forming a complex network. The two sets of respiratory units are, however, absolutely not mirror images of each other, as has been claimed by some investigators. Historically, the terms 'air capillaries' and 'blood capillaries' were derived from observations that the exchange tissue of the avian lung mainly consisted of a network of minuscule air- and vascular units. The entrenched notion that the ACs are straight (non-branching), blind-ending tubules that project outwards from the parabronchial lumen and that the BCs are direct tubules that run inwards parallel to and in contact with the ACs is overly simplistic, misleading and incorrect. The exact architectural properties of the respiratory units of the avian lung need to be documented and applied in formulating reliable physiological models. A few ostensibly isolated ACs were identified.

Surgical specimens and tumor cells in primary culture of salivary pleomorphic adenomas were used for immunohistochemistry for CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors Flk-1 and Flt-1, as well as for hypoxia markers, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and lactate dehydrogenase-1 (LDH). At the same time, alternative splicing modes of the VEGF gene and expression levels of the HIF-1alpha gene were analyzed in surgical specimens by means of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing of the PCR products. In addition to co-immunolocalization with CD31+ vascular endothelial cells, VEGF and its receptors were demonstrated in normal duct epithelial and myoepithelial cells as well as in tumor cells in ductal structures and in myxochondroid stromata. Immunolocalizations for HIF-1alpha and LDH were confirmed in the VEGF-positive area. Immunofluorescence signals for VEGF and others were confirmed in pleomorphic adenoma cells in culture. RT-PCR results showed that there were at least four splicing modes of the VEGF gene, among which VEGF(121) was most enhanced, and higher HIF-1alpha levels in pleomorphic adenomas.

The potential spread of infection into the mediastinum, involving the prosthetic valve, grafts, and suture lines, makes this an extremely serious complication confronting both cardiac and plastic surgeons.\nTopical negative pressure (TNP) dressing has been proven to be effective for wound healing. We want to take advantages of this equipment to improve the results of intractable sternal wound infection. The results are discussed.\nFrom December 1996 to July 2002, 25 patients with sternal wound infections were treated at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital. Nine patients suffering intractable sternal osteomyelitis were managed with debridement and TNP dressings. These patients received 1-3 debridements (an average of 2.2 debridements), and the average TNP dressing treatment period was 20.2 days (ranging from 3 to 43 days). After management, the infections were controlled and healthy vascularized wounds were achieved. Then, flap reconstruction could be performed for complete wound closure. Seven of the nine patients survived, and there was no recurrence of sternal osteomyelitis during follow-up period (ranging from 5 to 70 months).\nThe advantages of applying TNP dressings in cases of intractable sternal wound infections include (1) protecting the underlying mediasternal structure from infection, (2) permitting delayed sternal closure to avoid cardiac compression induced compromised cardiopulmonary function, (3) possibility of repeated wound inspection and bedside debridement, (4) cost-effectiveness of wound care, and (5) providing an option to promote sternal wound secondary healing for patients in poor physical condition.", "journal": "Journal of cardiac surgery", "date": "2005-04-28", "authors": ["Su-ShinLee", "Sin-DawLin", "Huai-MinChen", "Tsai-MingLin", "Chin-ChiangYang", "Chung-ShengLai", "Ying-FuChen", "Chaw-ChiChiu"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1540-8191.2005.200416.x"}

We validated the model by comparing responses to the cell wall lipids from Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) to reported activities in other models. BCG lipid-coated beads and bone marrow-derived macrophages (input macrophages) were injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. Input macrophages and recruited peritoneal exudate cells took up fluorescently tagged BCG lipids, and matrix-associated macrophages and neutrophils produced tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1alpha, and interleukin-6. Leukocyte numbers and cytokine levels were greater in BCG lipid-bearing matrices than matrices containing non-coated or phosphatidylglycerol-coated beads. Leukocytes arrived in successive waves of neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils, followed by NK and T cells (CD4(+), CD8(+), or gammadelta) at 7 days and B cells within 12 days.

A significant complication experienced by physicians who perform bone defect filling surgery is the risk of subsequent bacterial infections and the inefficiency of oral antibiotics to provide adequate prophylaxis against microorganisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In order to deliver both DBM and an efficient antiobiotic at high local concentrations without deleterious systemic effects, a ceramic sustained delivery system was implanted and monitored over the course of 30 days for bone regeneration, infection, and systemic effects. Twenty-five adult Sprague Dawley albino male rats were used in the experiment. They were randomly divided into five equal groups. Animals in group 1 were used as control, group 2 animals had a created 5mm defect, in group 3 defect induced and implanted with devices loaded with antibiotic (tobramycin) alone, group 4 had a created defect plus DBM, and group 5 had a created defect, plus tobramycin (which is effective against the aforementioned organisms) and DBM. At 30 days post-implantation, the experimental animals showed no significant difference in weight when compared to the control and sham animals. X-rays taken at this time showed the experimental femurs to be totally healed and virtually indistinguishable from control. Initial dissections revealed that the implants were accepted by the hosts as shown by the fibrous, vascularized sheath that surrounded the femurs and capsules.

This can turn an elective procedure into a complicated and cost-intensive problem. Only a few studies have addressed the incidence of dural tears, but there have been many studies dealing with various techniques that can be employed to repair dural tears. The present study was carried out to analyze predisposing factors for dural tears during trepanation in order to optimize the design of a robot-assisted trepanation system.\n100 patients were analyzed prospectively. An evaluation sheet was designed to document size and location of the lesion and the craniotomy, the geometry and number of burr holes, and the auxiliary tools used during bone flap removal. Furthermore, the suspected histology was noted and anatomical facts, including cranial vault thickness and the presence of hyperostosis frontalis interna, were documented.\nIn 100 craniotomies performed, in the majority of cases (64 %), in order to gain access to intracerebral lesions, 30 dural tears were seen, involving both dural layers in 26 cases. There were 26 tears located under the margins of the craniotomy; the length was 0-3 cm in 18 patients (69 %). Significant predisposing factors were the thickness of the cranial vault and the presence of a hyperostosis frontalis. Furthermore, the location (frontal) and the diagnosis of an extracerebral pathology, including meningiomas, were significant factors for dural tears. Elderly patients and the use of the drill to complete the trepanation were also significant predisposing factors. Dural repair was done using suturing, in most of the cases combined with a free periostal flap. Central dural tears were integrated into the planned dural opening. A vascularized flap or muscle was used in the minority of cases. Postoperative cerebral fluid leakage was seen in two patients, wound infections in three.\nDural tears occurring during craniotomy cannot be prevented, when predisposing factors are taken into account. The absence of brain damage may due to two factors: 1) in elderly patients with hyperostosis, an additional atrophy of the brain is present; 2) extracerebral tumors, with their space-occupying growth, shift the underlying brain away from the calvaria.

Cancer Res 2003; 63:8948-54). It has also been reported that expression of the Coxsackie adenovirus receptor and subsequent transfection efficiency of the adenovirus in cancer cells were enhanced by HDACI treatment. In this study, we extended these observations to explore the combination effect of adenoviral vector carrying wild type p53 (Ad-p53) gene therapy with a HDACI, sodium butyrate (SB), on xenografted human gastric cancer cells (KATO-III) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HuH7) in nude mice. We first confirmed an increased expression of Coxsackie adenovirus receptors with an associated increment of transgene (X-gal) expression by SB treatment in KATO-III cells. We then injected Ad-p53 into subcutaneous tumors of KATO-III and HuH7 combined with intraperitoneal administration of SB and found a significantly higher growth suppressive effect than single treatments of each. Even a complete regression of tumors was observed in three of five mice treated with this combination while with single treatment no tumor regression was observed. Tumors treated with the combination showed higher numbers of TUNEL positive cells than those treated with a single modality. Moreover, necrotic changes were more evident in tumors treated with the combination than separately, a compatible finding to the observation that vascularity revealed by CD34 staining was poorer in tumors treated with the combination than those treated with p53 gene or SB alone. This was further supported by the finding that BAI-1 (brain specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1), an inhibitor of vascularization, was induced by SB treatment in KATO-III and HuH7 cells transfected with Ad-p53.

The villous tree appeared made of an uninterrupted structure of collagen fibres. The collagen fibres connected the chorionic villi axis with their basal plates and organised differently according to the various levels of villous branching. The collagen of stem villi showed copious fibres. The external fibres (facing the villous surface) were arranged mainly longitudinally. The central core of the villi (inner fibres) were arranged concentrically around the wall of the fetal vessels. Both external and internal fibres formed stratified lamellae or small parallel bundles. The inner core of stem villi showed small holes housing capillary spaces. Mature intermediate and terminal villi showed a scarce amount of collagen arranged in thin concentric layer within the villous core, surrounding numerous dilated capillary and sinusoid spaces.These observations demonstrated that the extracellular matrix of human chorionic villi is highly compartmentalised and shows a variable structural 3-D distribution depending on the branching level of the villous tree, such a distribution ensures the most favourable microenvironment for feto-maternal exchanges and it is likely able to provide a modulated support to the developing chorionic fetal vessels and trophoblastic layer as well.", "journal": "The Journal of reproduction and development", "date": "2005-04-23", "authors": ["EnricoVizza", "SilviaCorrer", "FabrizioBarberini", "RosemarieHeyn", "SerenaBianchi", "GuidoMacchiarelli"], "doi": "10.1262/jrd.17022"}

When mice were intraperitoneally injected, PGG also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis induced by Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and the growth of LLC by 57 and 91% of control tumor weight at 4 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased microvessel density, decreased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased tumor cell apoptosis. Similarly, PGG significantly attenuated the expression of COX-2 and VEGF and reduced the secretion of VEGF and prostaglandin E2 in bFGF-treated HUVECs. Furthermore, the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 significantly inhibited tube formation and neo-vascularization in CAM, supporting the role of COX-2 in PGG inhibition of angiogenesis. PGG diminished the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, Jun NH2-terminal kinase and activated phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in a dose-dependent manner in bFGF-treated HUVECs. In addition, p38 inhibitor SB203580 abolished the downregulation of COX-2, VEGF and the antiproliferative activity by PGG. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PGG exerts antitumor activity primarily via inhibition of angiogenesis through COX-2 and MAPK- dependent pathways.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2005-04-23", "authors": ["Jeong-EunHuh", "Eun-OkLee", "Min-SeokKim", "Kyung-SunKang", "Cheol-HoKim", "Bae-CheonCha", "Young-JoonSurh", "Sung-HoonKim"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgi097"}

Four women had bilateral masses. After a morphologic reevaluation was done, color pulsed Doppler sonography was used to obtain flow velocity waveforms, and velocimetric indices were calculated (resistive index, pulsatility index, and peak systolic velocity). Thereafter, 3-dimensional power Doppler sonography was used to assess vascularization of highly suggestive areas (gross papillary projections, solid areas, and thick septations), meaning a focused assessment (\"sampling\") of a suggestive area of the tumor. With a virtual organ computer-aided analysis program, vascular indices (vascularization index, flow index, and vascular flow index) were automatically calculated. A definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained in each case.\nForty masses (82%) were malignant and 9 (18%) were benign. Morphologic evaluation revealed 10 (20%) unilocular solid masses, 20 (41%) multilocular solid masses, and 19 (39%) mostly solid masses. Blood flow was found in all cases. Median vascularization index (15.5% versus 8.2%; P = .002), flow index (33.6 versus 20.8; P = .007), and vascular flow index (5.2 versus 2.3; P = .001) were significantly higher in malignant tumors.

{"title": "Human breast tumors override the antiangiogenic effect of stromal thrombospondin-1 in vivo.", "abstract": "The antiangiogenic extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in animals. However, the clinical relevance of such findings are equivocal as increased stromal TSP-1 expression has been associated with either good or poor prognosis. In an effort to obtain a more integrated understanding of the role of TSP-1 in breast cancer, we first used a breast tumorigenesis model in which tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts were engineered to produce high levels of TSP-1. We demonstrate here that stromal TSP-1 delayed human MDA-MB-231/B02 breast tumor growth. However, this delay in MDA-MB-231/B02 tumor growth upon exposure to TSP-1 was associated with an increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumor cells themselves, leading to a tumor growth rate comparable to that of tumors whose fibroblasts did not overproduce TSP-1. Clinical evidence also suggested that primary breast carcinomas have adapted to escape the effects of stromal TSP-1. TSP-1 was found to be expressed in the stroma of human breast carcinomas where, although its level correlated with decreased vascularization, it was unexpectedly associated with a reduction of relapse-free survival. In metastatic axillary lymph nodes, tumor cells expressed high levels of VEGF and TSP-1 expression were no longer associated with a decreased vascularization.

{"title": "Tumor-induced mechanical hyperalgesia involves CGRP receptors and altered innervation and vascularization of DsRed2 fluorescent hindpaw tumors.", "abstract": "Functional and anatomical relationships among primary afferent fibers, blood vessels, and cancers are poorly understood. However, recent evidence suggests that physical and biochemical interactions between these peripheral components are important to both tumor biology and cancer-associated pain. To determine the role of these peripheral components in a mouse model of cancer pain, we quantified the change in nerve and blood vessel density within a fibrosarcoma tumor mass using stereological analysis of serial confocal optical sections of immunostained hind paw. To this end we introduced the Discoma coral-derived red fluorescent protein (DsRed2) into the NCTC 2472 fibrosarcoma line using the Sleeping Beauty transposon methodology, thus providing a unique opportunity to visualize tumor-nerve-vessel associations in context with behavioral assessment of tumor-associated hyperalgesia. Tumors from hyperalgesic mice are more densely innervated with calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerve fibers and less densely vascularized than tumors from non-hyperalgesic mice. As hyperalgesia increased from Day 5 to 12 post-implantation, the density of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5)-immunoreactive nerves and CD31-immunoreactive blood vessels in tumors decreased, whereas CGRP-immunoreactive nerve density remained unchanged. Importantly, intra-tumor injection of a CGRP1 receptor antagonist (CGRP 8-37) partially blocked the tumor-associated mechanical hyperalgesia, indicating that local production of CGRP may contribute to tumor-induced nociception through a receptor-mediated process. The results describe for the first time the interaction among sensory nerves, blood vessels and tumor cells in otherwise healthy tissue, and our assessment supports the hypothesis that direct tumor cell-axon communication may underlie, at least in part, the occurrence of cancer pain.", "journal": "Pain", "date": "2005-04-20", "authors": ["Paul WWacnik", "Christine MBaker", "Michael JHerron", "Betsy TKren", "Bruce RBlazar", "George LWilcox", "Maria KHordinsky", "Alvin JBeitz", "Marna EEricson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pain.2005.02.024"}

Orchestrating the presentation of these signals may greatly enhance the regeneration of lost tissue mass. Bone formation, for example, is dependent on the signaling of BMPs, molecules initiating vascularization (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), and osteogenic precursor cells capable of responding to these cues and forming bone tissue. It was hypothesized that combined and concerted delivery of these factors from biodegradable scaffolds would lead to enhanced bone formation.\nPoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffolds containing combinations of condensed plasmid DNA encoding for BMP-4, VEGF, and human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) were implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of SCID mice. Implants (n = 6) were retrieved at 3, 8, and 15 weeks after implantation. Bone and blood vessel formation was determined qualitatively and quantitatively by methods including histology, immmunostaining, and muCT.\nScaffolds delivering VEGF resulted in a prominent increase in blood vessel formation relative to the conditions without VEGF. BMP-4 expression in scaffolds encapsulating condensed DNA was also confirmed at the 15-week time-point, showing the characteristic of long-term delivery in this system. Combined delivery of all three types of factors resulted in a significant increase in the quantity of regenerated bone compared with any factor alone or any two factors combined, as measured with DXA, X-ray, and histomorphometric analysis. Furthermore, bone formed with all three factors had elastic moduli significantly higher than any other condition.\nConcerted delivery of BMP-4, VEGF, and hBMSCs promoted greater bone formation relative to any single factor or combination of two factors. Materials systems that allows multifactorial presentation more closely mimic natural developmental processes, and these results may have important implications for bone regeneration therapeutics.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2005-04-13", "authors": ["Yen-ChenHuang", "DarnellKaigler", "Kevin GRice", "Paul HKrebsbach", "David JMooney"], "doi": "10.1359/JBMR.041226"}

Their healing ability following traumatic injury is enormous. Pain experience caused by dentin or pulp damage of tusks seems to be negligible in elephants. In this study we examined the pulp tissue and the nerve distribution using histology, electron microscopy and immunhistochemistry. The results demonstrate that the pulp comprises two differently structured regions. Randomly orientated collagen fibres characterize a cone-like part lying rostral to the foramen apicis dentis. Numerous nerve fibres and Ruffini endings are found within this cone. Rostral to the cone, delicate collagen fibres and large vessels are orientated longitudinally. The rostral two-thirds of the pulp are highly vascularized, whereas nerve fibres are sparse. Vessel and nerve fibre distribution and the structure of connective tissue possibly play important roles in healing and in the obviously limited pain experience after tusk injuries and pulp alteration.

{"title": "The role of cartilage canals in endochondral and perichondral bone formation: are there similarities between these two processes?", "abstract": "We investigated the development of cartilage canals to clarify their function in the process of bone formation. Cartilage canals are tubes containing vessels that are found in the hyaline cartilage prior to the formation of a secondary ossification centre (SOC). Their exact role is still controversial and it is unclear whether they contribute to endochondral bone formation when an SOC appears. We examined the cartilage canals of the chicken femur in different developmental stages (E20, D2, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 13). To obtain a detailed picture of the cellular and molecular events within and around the canals the femur was investigated by means of three-dimensional reconstruction, light microscopy, electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), type I and II collagen]. An SOC was visible for the first time on the last embryonic day (E20). Cartilage canals were an extension of the vascularized perichondrium and its mesenchymal stem cell layers into the hyaline cartilage. The canals formed a complex network within the epiphysis and some of them penetrated into the SOC were they ended blind. The growth of the canals into the SOC was promoted by VEGF. As the development progressed the SOC increased in size and adjacent canals were incorporated into it. The canals contained chondroclasts, which opened the lacunae of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and this was followed by invasion of mesenchymal cells into the empty lacunae and formation of an osteoid layer. In older stages this layer mineralized and increased in thickness by addition of further cells. Outside the SOC cartilage canals are surrounded by osteoid, which is formed by the process of perichondral bone formation. We conclude that cartilage canals contribute to both perichondral and endochondral bone formation and that osteoblasts have the same origin in both processes.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2005-04-09", "authors": ["Michael J FBlumer", "StefanoLongato", "ElisabethRichter", "Maria TeresaP\u00e9rez", "Kadriye ZeynepKonakci", "HelgaFritsch"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00404.x"}
{"title": "Inosculation of tissue-engineered capillaries with the host's vasculature in a reconstructed skin transplanted on mice.", "abstract": "The major limitation for the application of an autologous in vitro tissue-engineered reconstructed skin (RS) for the treatment of burnt patients is the delayed vascularization of its relatively thick dermal avascular component, which may lead to graft necrosis. We have developed a human endothelialized reconstructed skin (ERS), combining keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells (EC) in a collagen sponge. This skin substitute then spontaneously forms a network of capillary-like structures (CLS) in vitro. After transplantation to nude mice, we demonstrated that CLS containing mouse blood were observed underneath the epidermis in the ERS in less than 4 days, a delay comparable to our human skin control. In comparison, a 14-day period was necessary to achieve a similar result with the non-endothelialized RS. Furthermore, no mouse blood vessels were ever observed close to the epidermis before 14 days in the ERS and the RS. We thus concluded that the early vascularization observed in the ERS was most probably the result of inosculation of the CLS network with the host's capillaries, rather than neovascularization, which is a slower process. These results open exciting possibilities for the clinical application of many other tissue-engineered organs requiring a rapid vascularization.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2005-04-09", "authors": ["Pierre-LucTremblay", "Val\u00e9rieHudon", "Fran\u00e7oisBerthod", "LucieGermain", "Fran\u00e7ois AAuger"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-6143.2005.00790.x"}

To emphasize the importance of preventive ophthalmologic examination and early treatment of ocular disorders.\nA review of published data.\nVision is one of the most important senses in the normal physical and cognitive development of children. Schoolchildren who were born preterm have impaired visual, motor and cognitive functions when compared to those of children born full term. This is more a consequence of central nervous system immaturity than of localized injuries to ocular and/ or cortical structures. The literature pinpoints retinopathy of prematurity, strabismus and refractive errors as the main ophthalmologic alterations resulting from prematurity. Retinopathy of prematurity is one of the main causes of preventable blindness in childhood. It is estimated that on average 562 children become blind each year in Brazil, which is a very high socioeconomic cost to result from a treatable disease. Children with visual deficiencies may be helped by programs of early visual stimulation in order to promote their environmental integration.\nThe recommendation is that every preterm newborn weighing less than 1,500 g and/or with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks should be monitored until complete retinal vascularization and that the first examination should be performed between the fourth and sixth weeks of life.

The objective of this article is to evaluate reconstruction of the central compartment using a combination of free jejunal transfer for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction, together with regional deltopectoral flaps for tracheostomal reconstruction and cutaneous resurfacing. Myocutaneous flaps, such as pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi flaps, have been used previously for external coverage but can be bulky, causing obstruction of the tracheostoma.\nFrom 1995 to 2002, seven patients underwent reconstruction of the central compartment with seven jejunal and nine deltopectoral flaps. Five patients required resection for tracheostomal recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma, and two patients required resection for massive pharyngocutaneous fistulas.

The progression of the disease may lead to serious or life-threatening conditions such as local bone destruction, periorbital abscess, osteomyelitis, meningitis, cranial epidural abscess, or septicemia. This study presents the use of the galeal-frontalis myofascial flap as part of the treatment of this disease.\nThirty-one patients with chronic frontal sinus disease requiring obliteration were included in this study; all were approached through a coronal incision. The anterior wall of the frontal sinus was removed and the frontal sinus disease was evacuated. The sinus mucosa was completely removed, and the frontal sinus and nasofrontal duct were totally obliterated with either a unilateral flap or a bilateral galeal-frontalis flap.\nAll patients had failed medical therapy and many had failed endonasal and endoscopic procedures. The mean follow-up was 43.6 months (range, 1 to 125 months). There were two early complications, a seroma and a hematoma. Sinus infection recurred in one patient 3 months postoperatively. The recurrent infection was treated in the same manner, using the available and viable galeal-frontalis flap to obliterate the frontal sinus, with no recurrence after 40 months.\nThe galeal-frontalis flap has been investigated by angiography and is based on the supratrochlear and supraorbital vessels. Its location and vascularity make it reliable and effective for frontal sinus obliteration. In the head and neck area and elsewhere, filling defects with vascularized tissue prevents infection. A further advantage is that any residual defects are usually well tolerated by patients, and those requesting correction can be easily accommodated. The risks and complications from using exogenous materials and from performing secondary procedures for graft harvest are avoided.

Ocular surface changes included chronic blepharitis and decreased tear meniscus in all patients, limbal ischemia (81.3%), and conjunctival vascular abnormalities (50%). Corneal signs in order of frequency were: scar or opacity (87.5%), neovascularization (70.8%), thinning (58.3%), lipoid deposits (52.1%), amyloid deposits (43.8%), and epithelial defects and irregularity (31.3%). Many patients received conservative treatment; others underwent allograft stem cell transplantation (20 eyes of 17 patients), penetrating keratoplasty (12 eyes of 12 patients), and lamellar keratoplasty (4 eyes of 3 patients). Conjunctival specimens were evaluated by light microscopy.

The history of angiogenesis research is long-more than 250 years-and the Microcirculatory Society has been the birthplace of numerous techniques, assays, and scientific concepts that have stimulated massive research endeavors in the pharmaceutical and medical arena. At present, angiogenesis isa dynamic field in which the molecular genetic and proteomic components of the process are still being identified, while integrative systems approaches are once again being recognized as essential to understand microvascular assembly in vivo across multiple scales from cells to whole vessel networks. A short history of people and ideas in this field is presented, followed by discussion of emerging directions receiving intense attention today and major questions that remain unanswered. The primary conclusion is that the need for scientists trained in the integrative approaches nurtured by the Microcirculatory Society over the past 50 years has never been greater, as it is clear that a complete mechanistic understanding of vessel adaptation (based on genomic and proteomic supporting casts) will now require deeper studies of angiogenesis and microvascular remodeling in the exquisite complexity of the native microenvironment-the microcirculation.", "journal": "Microcirculation (New York, N.Y. : 1994)", "date": "2005-04-05", "authors": ["Thomas CSkalak"], "doi": "10.1080/10739680590895037"}

In particular, the structural characteristics that would allow interpretation of function were analyzed, particularly those of gas exchange in the chorioallantoic placenta and histotrophy in the omphaloplacenta. Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii has a complex placenta consisting of a placentome, paraplacentome, and omphaloplacenta. The paraplacentome has a well-vascularized lamina propria in which projecting uterine capillaries displace the overlying uterine epithelial cells, reducing them to attenuated cytoplasmic extensions. Associated cell nuclei and organelles are lost from this region, to provide a capillary lumen to uterine lumen barrier of 0.5-1.0 microm. Hence, the paraplacentome is likely a prominent site for gaseous exchange via simple diffusion. The omphaloplacenta has a similar cytology to that of the placentome, but the uterine epithelial cells are hypertrophied and the apical plasma membrane actively secretes vesicles into the uterine lumen. The omphaloplacenta shows features that are associated with histotrophic transport of nutrients via vesicle secretion, very similar to that of lipid apocrine secretion. The placentome consists of cuboidal cells in the uterine epithelium, with large centrally located nuclei overlying the well-vascularized lamina propria. Although the placentome has a similar cytological structure to that of the omphaloplacenta, granules or active vesicle secretion were not observed. Thus, the placentome may be associated with histotrophy, but not via apocrine secretion. Squamate placentation is epitheliochorial; however, we propose a new term be used to describe the type of placentation in P. entrecasteauxii: \"cyto-epitheliochorial,\" because of the extreme attenuation of uterine epithelial cells of the paraplacentome.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2005-04-02", "authors": ["Susan MAdams", "Joanna MBiazik", "Michael BThompson", "Christopher RMurphy"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10314"}

Three stages of placental development could be assigned to embryos based on the arrangement of the extraembryonic membranes. A highly vascular choriovitelline placenta was present in the embryonic hemisphere and a nonvascular bilaminar omphalopleure covered most of the abembryonic hemisphere of the egg during embryonic Stages 10-28. A chorioallantoic placenta replaced the choriovitelline placenta by embryonic Stage 29 and an omphaloplacenta covered the abembryonic hemisphere at this stage. The combination of these two placental types occurred in Stage 29-36 embryos. The final stage of placentation, embryonic Stages 37-40, was characterized by an omphalallantoic placenta in the abembryonic hemisphere and a chorioallantoic placenta in the embryonic hemisphere of the egg. The choriovitelline and chorioallantoic placentae are well vascularized, with closely apposed maternal and embryonic blood vessels. These structures are the most likely sites of respiratory exchange. In contrast, the omphaloplacenta and omphalallantoic placentae contain cuboidal or columnar epithelia and these structures may function in histotrophic exchange.

The ND-GFP stem cells give rise to the outer-root sheath of the hair follicle as well as an ND-GFP interfollicular vascular network. In this study, we demonstrate that ND-GFP stem cells isolated from the hair-follicle bulge area that are negative for the keratinocyte marker keratin 15 can differentiate into neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro. These pluripotent ND-GFP stem cells are positive for the stem cell marker CD34, as well as keratin 15-negative, suggesting their relatively undifferentiated state. The apparent primitive state of the ND-GFP stem cells is compatible with their pluripotency. Furthermore, we show that cells derived from ND-GFP stem cells can differentiate into neurons after transplantation to the subcutis of nude mice.

{"title": "Phenotypic persistence after reoxygenation of hypoxic neuroblastoma cells.", "abstract": "Fast-growing solid tumors are usually insufficiently vascularized, leading to areas with necrosis and/or poorly oxygenated cells. Tumor cells adapt to acute hypoxic stress. Central to this adaptation are the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which are degraded at normoxic but become stabilized at hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic (1% O2) neuroblastoma cells downregulate sympathetic nervous system marker genes, whereas neural crest cell markers are upregulated, suggesting that hypoxic tumor cells adopt a less mature phenotype, which in the clinical setting would translate to more aggressive tumors with increased metastatic potential. Here, we compared gene expression patterns in neuroblastoma cells grown at 1%, 5% (a physiologic oxygen level) and 21% O2. At 5% O2, cells developed a weak hypoxic phenotype and HIF-2 alpha, but not HIF-1 alpha, was acutely stabilized. At 1% O2, HIF-2 alpha protein remained present in long-term cultures, while HIF-1 alpha was present only transiently. The stability of the hypoxia-induced dedifferentiated phenotype in cells acutely reoxygenated at either 21% or 5% O2 persisted for at least 24 hr. Genes associated with a differentiated state, like NPY, ChrA and ChrB, were still downregulated and hypoxia-induced genes, like TH and Id2, remained upregulated. Thus, if these culture conditions are viewed as models for acute reoxygenation of metastasizing hypoxic tumor cells, our data suggest that an aggressive hypoxic phenotype persists for 24 hr or more, which might be long enough for the cells to be able to home to secondary sites, in part as a consequence of their immature hypoxic characteristics.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2005-04-01", "authors": ["LindaHolmquist", "AnnikaJ\u00f6gi", "SvenP\u00e5hlman"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.21024"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate various morphometric characteristics of microvessels in lymph node sections of 286 patients with HL at diagnosis and investigate their relationship with clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis. Microvessel density (MVD), total vascular area (TVA) and several size- and shape-related microvascular parameters were quantitated--after anti-CD34 immunohistochemical staining--in the region of most intense vascularization, using image analysis. An increase in microvessel caliber parameters (area, perimeter, major and minor axis length) and a decrease in MVD were noted with increasing stage. An inverse relationship was recorded between MVD and the number of involved sites (NIS) and LDH. In univariate analysis, overall disease-specific survival was adversely affected by MVD and TVA, whereas inferior failure-free survival (FFS) was associated with the presence of more flattened vessel sections. Multivariate analysis disclosed that the extent of angiogenesis (MVD/TVA), age and the NIS independently affected overall survival. Accordingly, FFS was independently linked to the shape of microvessels and albumin levels or the NIS.

Irregular vascular structure and abnormal tumour physiology also cause erratic blood flow in tumour vessels. We reasoned that tumour stroma, including vascular endothelial cells, would consequently experience transient hypoxia that may allow transcriptional targeting as part of an antivascular gene therapy approach to cancer. To exploit hypoxia for transcriptional regulation, retroviral vectors were generated with modified LTRs: a 6-mer of hypoxia response elements in place of the viral enhancer produced near wild-type levels of expression in hypoxia but was functionally inert in normoxia. In a tumour xenograft model, expression was mainly around areas of necrosis, which were shown to be hypoxic; no expression was detected in tumour stroma. Time-course experiments in vitro demonstrated that expression was transient in response to a hypoxic episode, such that a reporter gene would be insensitive to acute hypoxia in vivo. In contrast, a significant therapeutic effect was seen upon ganciclovir administration with a vector expressing thymidine kinase (TK) in the tumour stroma. Expression of TK was more effective when targeted to acute hypoxia in the stroma compared to chronic hypoxia in the poorly vascularized regions of the tumour cell compartment. The data presented here are evidence that hypoxia in the stromal compartment does occur and that transient hypoxia constitutes a valid therapeutic target.", "journal": "Gene therapy", "date": "2005-04-01", "authors": ["NIngram", "C DPorter"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.gt.3302504"}

We applied a vascularized pedicle iliac bone graft to the pelvic ring reconstruction after resection of a huge sacral schwannoma. When a stable pelvic ring was regained by using a lumbosacral instrumentation technique, a tricortical iliac bone graft with its vascular pedicle was harvested, transported into the dead space, and tied to the right residual sacrum and the left ilium.

The mean age was 2 months and 21 days. The mean clinical follow up was 22 months and 7 days.\nMRI was performed for non-diagnosed lesions (4 cases) or to further define lesion extension (8 cases). The lesions either involved the head and neck (8 cases) or the extremities (4 cases). At MR imaging, all immature hemangiomas corresponded to well defined homogeneous T2W hyperintense masses. On T1-weighted images, 11 immature hemangiomas were isointense with intense homogeneous enhancement. Eleven tumors contained linear low signal intensity flow voids. Ten lesions had superficial cutaneous and/or subcutaneous extension whereas 2 lesions had intra-muscular extension. At Doppler US, immature hemangiomas were highly vascularized masses, with well defined margins, often compressibles, homogeneous isoechoic or heterogeneous with nodular hypoechoic foci, relative to subcutaneous fat. A diagnosis of immature hemangioma was confirmed either by pathology (2 cases) or clinical follow up (10 cases).\nIn our study, the MR imaging features of immature hemangiomas were reproducible and similar to reports from the literature. MRI is a useful tool to better define the extent of immature hemangiomas, which can be difficult to assess at US. The sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging for this pathology remain to be defined.", "journal": "Journal de radiologie", "date": "2005-03-31", "authors": ["KLambot", "LcLougu\u00e9-Sorgho", "GGorincour", "GMagalon", "SChapuy", "BBourli\u00e8re-Najean", "PDevred", "PPetit"], "doi": "10.1016/s0221-0363(05)81335-6"}

Loss of pVHL results in constitutive activation of the transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, whose relative contributions to the pathogenesis of the VHL phenotype have yet to be defined. In order to examine the role of HIF in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-associated vascular tumorigenesis, we utilized Cre-loxP-mediated recombination to inactivate hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (Hif-1alpha) and arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) genes in a VHL mouse model of cavernous liver hemangiomas and polycythemia. Deletion of Hif-1alpha did not affect the development of vascular tumors and polycythemia, nor did it suppress the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and erythropoietin (Epo). In contrast, phosphoglycerokinase (Pgk) expression was substantially decreased, providing evidence for target gene-dependent functional redundancy between different Hif transcription factors. Inactivation of Arnt completely suppressed the development of hemangiomas, polycythemia, and Hif-induced gene expression. Here, we demonstrate genetically that the development of VHL-associated vascular tumors in the liver depends on functional ARNT. Furthermore, we provide evidence that individual HIF transcription factors may play distinct roles in the development of specific VHL disease manifestations.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2005-03-31", "authors": ["Erinn BRankin", "Debra FHiggins", "Jacqueline AWalisser", "Randall SJohnson", "Christopher ABradfield", "Volker HHaase"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.25.8.3163-3172.2005"}

It has been suggested that the anti-tumor effect of lenalidomide is related to its anti-angiogenic potency. In this regard, we have previously shown that lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis in both rat and human in vitro models but does not affect endothelial cell proliferation. We now show that oral administration of lenalidomide attenuates growth factor-induced angiogenesis in vivo; the rat mesenteric window assay was utilized to show that lenalidomide significantly inhibits vascularization in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that lenalidomide significantly inhibits growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration. This correlates with the inhibitory effect of lenalidomide on growth factor-induced Akt phosphorylation, thereby providing a potential mechanism for its anti-migratory and subsequent anti-angiogenic effects. These data further support the use of lenalidomide as an orally administered drug for the effective treatment of angiogenesis-dependent conditions, including cancer, and suggest a potential mechanism of action.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2005-03-31", "authors": ["KeithDredge", "RebeccaHorsfall", "Simon PRobinson", "Ling-HuaZhang", "LingLu", "YangTang", "Michael AShirley", "GeorgeMuller", "PeterSchafer", "DavidStirling", "Angus GDalgleish", "J BlakeBartlett"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2005.01.002"}

The cells were transfected with a histone H2B-GFP fusion protein, permitting real-time measurement of tumor size, as well as mitotic and apoptotic indices. To generate a \"pseudo-orthotopic\" milieu, pieces of prostate tissue (10-15 mm2) from donor mice were implanted into the chambers of C57BL/6 mice. The prostate tissue grafted into the chambers retained its native vasculature, as determined by transplantation of prostate tissue from GFP transgenic mice. TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer tumor spheroids (25,000 cells) were implanted in the chamber. Without prostate tissue, TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors were poorly angiogenic, displayed low mitotic and apoptotic indices (0.7 x 10(-4)), and no significant tumor growth could be detected. TRAMP-C2 tumors growing on transplanted prostate tissue in the chamber on the other hand had mitotic indices in the order of 1.6 x 10(-4) and apoptotic indices in the order of 0.8 x 10(-4). Furthermore, tumors with stroma were highly angiogenic, and were fully vascularized within 7-10 days. During a 4-week observation period, the number of tumor cells increased by nearly 300%. We used the model to study the effects of surgical castration. The most profound response was a rapid vascular regression of the tumor vasculature.

The operation included resection of the stump neuroma (four patients) or neurolysis of the neuroma-in-continuity (three patients) and coverage of the nerve with a vascularized fascial, fasciocutaneous, or perforator flap (three pedicled regional flaps and four free flaps). A modified quadruple visual analog scale was used to quantify pain before and after surgical treatment.

A surgical strategy for reconstruction of the cranial base using vascularized flaps was carried out. The closure of the surgical wound was performed in three layers. A specially developed myofascial flap (temporalis fascia, cervical fascia, and sternocleidomastoid muscle) associated to the inferior rotation of the posterior portion of the temporalis muscle was used to reconstruct the cranial base with vascularized flaps.\nIn this series of 66 patients, postoperative CSF leakage developed in three cases.

{"title": "Botulinum toxin injections for children with excessive drooling.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of ultrasonography-guided injections of botulinum toxin A into the parotid glands of children with severe drooling (sialorrhea). Excessive drooling is common in children with chronic neurologic disorders. Preliminary observations in adults suggest that injections of botulinum toxin A into the parotid glands can decrease drooling, but the optimal dose, sites of injection, and concomitant use of imaging during injections and its use for children have not been established. Ultrasonography was used to guide the injection of botulinum toxin (10-25 IU) into both parotid glands of nine children with excessive drooling. Subjective and objective measures of the severity of drooling were collected before and after botulinum toxin A injections. A booster injection was provided if the initial response was inadequate. Injections were well tolerated, and no adverse reactions were observed. Ultrasonography revealed that the parotid gland showed a variable depth, extent, and vascularization. Eight of nine patients needed a booster injection after 1 month. Objective measures of drooling severity were improved in seven of nine patients. However, subjective improvement was reported in only three of nine patients, and this improvement was functionally significant in only one patient. Although intraparotid injection of botulinum toxin A is safe and causes a reduction in saliva production in children, the doses used in this study did not result in functionally significant improvement. Higher doses of botulinum toxin A in the parotid glands or concomitant injections into the submandibular glands can increase the efficacy of these injections. Variability in size, depth, and vascular supply of the parotid gland suggests the importance of ultrasonography guidance for optimizing injections.

Retinal neurons release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFA) to stimulate proliferation of astrocytes, which in turn stimulate blood vessel growth by secreting vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Presumably, there must be counteractive mechanisms for limiting astrocyte proliferation and VEGF production to prevent runaway angiogenesis. Here, we present evidence that the developing vessels provide feedback signals that trigger astrocyte differentiation--marked by cessation of cell division, upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and downregulation of VEGF. We prevented retinal vessel development by raising newborn mice in a high-oxygen atmosphere, which leads, paradoxically, to retinal hypoxia (confirmed by using the oxygen-sensing reagent EF5). The forced absence of vessels caused prolonged astrocyte proliferation and inhibited astrocyte differentiation in vivo. We could reproduce these effects by culturing retinal astrocytes in a low oxygen atmosphere, raising the possibility that blood-borne oxygen itself might induce astrocyte differentiation and indirectly prevent further elaboration of the vascular network.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2005-03-26", "authors": ["HeloiseWest", "William DRichardson", "MarcusFruttiger"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.01732"}

Both differentiate into ECs and promote vascular growth in vivo but have distinct characteristics. Despite the association of obesity and type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular disease, their effects on primitive EC progenitors (prECPs) have not been examined, and the limited data on monocytic EC progenitors are conflicting. We investigated functional parameters of primitive and monocytic EC progenitors from obese diabetic (Lepr(db)) mice. The viability, proliferation, and differentiation of EC progenitors were unaffected in Lepr(db) cell cultures under basal condition. However, Lepr(db)-derived prECPs, but not monocytic EC progenitors, were less able to cope with hypoxia and oxidative stress, conditions likely present when EC progenitors are most needed. Intrinsic prECP dysfunction was also apparent in vivo. Whereas injection of nondiabetic prECPs promoted vascularization of skin wounds, Lepr(db)-derived progenitors inhibited it in nondiabetic mice. Additionally, although treatment with Lepr(db)-derived prECPs did not significantly reduce blood flow restoration to ischemic limbs, it resulted in increased tissue necrosis and autoamputation. Thus, type 2 diabetes coupled with obesity seems to induce intrinsic EC progenitor dysfunction that is exacerbated by stress. prECPs are more affected than monocytic progenitors, exhibiting a reduced ability to survive or proliferate. The proangiogenic phenotype of prECPs also seems to convert to an antiangiogenic phenotype in obese diabetic mice.

Mice were initially fertile, but progressively lost fertility until 5-6 months when they were sterile with very few germ cells in the testis. XY(Sry-)Ods/+ males also failed to establish the correct male-specific pattern of vascularization at the time of sex determination, which could be correlated to an inability of XY(Sry-),Ods/+ males to fully down-regulate Wnt4 expression in the embryonic gonad. Increasing the amount of SOX9 by producing homozygous XY(Sry-)Ods/Ods males was able to completely rescue the phenotype and restore correct vascular patterning and long-term fertility.

Here, we investigated potential antitumor action in an in vitro cell model for promyelocytic leukemia (NB4-LR1), resistant to retinoid maturation. Purified soluble TSP-1 added to cultures induced a strong dose-dependent growth inhibition and a slowly developing maturation-independent cell death. Recombinant fragments of TSP-1 allowed mapping of these activities to its type 3 repeat/C-terminal domain, features that are distinct from those of TSP-1 action on solid tumors, previously ascribed to the type 1 repeat domain. Cell death in leukemia was characterized as a caspase-independent mechanism, without DNA fragmentation, but phosphatidylserine externalization followed by membrane permeabilization. Mitochondria membrane depolarization was inherent to TSP-1 action but did not produce release of death-promoting proteins (eg, noncaspase apoptosis regulators, apoptosis-induced factor [AIF], endonuclease G, or Omi/HtrA2 or the caspase regulators, cytochrome c or second mitochondrial activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein-binding protein with low isoelectric point [Smac/DIABLO]). Although detected, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was likely not involved in the death process. Finally, receptor agonist RFYVVM and RGD peptides indicated that TSP-1 death effects are mediated by membrane receptors CD47 and alphavbeta3.

Studies have shown that cerebral ischemia and hypoxia stimulate the expressions of VEGF and its receptors in the brain, while exogenous VEGF promotes the formation of new blood vessels in the ischemic brain penumbra, and reduce the volume of cerebral infarction. The effect of VEGF on cerebral ischemia was previously explained the mechanism that VEGF had a specific mitogenetic roles in cerebral endothelial cells and thus promoted neovascularization; however recent evidence has shown that VEGF also has direct effects on neural and glial cells. Its multiple protection roles on central nervous system involve vascularization, neurogenesis, direct neurotrophic and neuroprotective effect, as well as antiapoptosis effect, especially when brain ischemia occurs.

{"title": "Flexor digitorum profundus tendon to bone tunnel repair: a vascularization and histologic study in canines.", "abstract": "Recent in vivo canine studies have shown incomplete restoration of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) insertion site after transection and repair to the cortical surface of the distal phalanx. Previous biomechanical analyses of tendon to bone surface repair have suggested that repair site gap formation of greater than 3 mm occurs frequently under physiologic loads. A recent ex vivo investigation into a novel repair of the FDP tendon into a bone tunnel in the distal phalanx showed improved tensile properties with a decrease in repair site gap formation. Time-zero data, however, do not always accurately reflect in vivo responses. The repair response of the FDP tendon when placed in an osseous compartment is not known. The purpose of this study was to analyze the histologic and vascular anatomic properties of the FDP insertion site after transection and repair in a bone tunnel within the distal phalanx.\nTwenty-six FDP tendon to bone repairs were performed in 13 adult mongrel dogs after insertion site transection. The tendons were repaired in a bone tunnel in the distal phalanx. Vascular analysis of the tendon and repair site was performed by using a modified Spalteholtz technique and routine hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to assess histologic properties of the repair.\nIn normal specimens the vascular analysis showed that there was a distal network of vessels extending 1- to 2-cm proximal to the FDP insertion site. At 10 days after repair the distal tendon segment tendon remained avascular. By 21 days after repair there was proximal migration of an unorganized reticular network of tendon surface vessels with sparse intratendinous communications. At 6 weeks after repair the structure of the distal tendon vascular network resembled that of normals. The vascular response of the tendon within the bone tunnel followed a similar time frame. Histologic analysis showed an inflammatory reaction in the bone tunnel leading to a progressive degradation of that portion of the FDP tendon that resided in the tunnel. Tendon necrosis was not seen.\nThe FDP tendon, after insertion site transection and repair in a bone tunnel, undergoes a process of neovascularization and revascularization over a period of 6 weeks. There is a progressive loss of tendon parenchyma within the bone tunnel and the suture tracks appeared to serve as conduits for the ingrowth of inflammatory tissue. Restoration of the normal 4-zone tendon-bone interface was not seen. Although ex vivo biomechanical assessment of tendon repair in a bone tunnel appears promising, the repair response in vivo may not be favorable for tendon to bone healing. The progressive tendon degeneration that was observed here may have detrimental effects on repair site tensile properties, increasing the potential for early failure.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "date": "2005-03-23", "authors": ["Thomas TDovan", "TimothyRitty", "KonstantinosDitsios", "Matthew JSilva", "NozomuKusano", "Richard HGelberman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhsa.2004.02.007"}
{"title": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) coordinately regulates the expression of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPS) and angiogenic factors during fracture healing.", "abstract": "Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that TNF-alpha signaling contributes to the regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis and a lack of TNF-alpha signaling leads to a persistence of cartilaginous callus and delayed resorption of mineralized cartilage. This study examines how delays in the endochondral repair process affect the expression of specific mediators of proteolytic cartilage turnover and vascularization. Simple closed fractures were produced in wild type and TNF-alpha receptor (p55-/-/p75-/-)-deficient mice. Using ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) and microarray analysis, the expression of multiple mRNAs for various angiogenic factors and the metalloproteinase gene family were measured in fracture calluses. The direct actions of TNFalpha on the expression of specific angiogenic factors and metalloproteinases (MMPs) was examined in both cultured callus cells and articular chondrocytes to compare the effects of TNF-alpha in growth cartilage versus articular cartilage. MMPs 2, 9, 13, and 14 were quantitatively the most prevalent metalloproteases and all showed peaks in expression during the chondrogenic period. In the absence of TNF-alpha signaling, the expression of all of these mRNAs was reduced. The angiopoietin families of vascular regulators and their receptors were expressed at much higher levels than the VEGFs and their receptors and while the angiopoietins showed diminished or delayed expression in the absence of TNF-alpha signaling, VEGF and its receptors remained unaltered. The expression of vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI or TNFSF15) showed a near absence in its expression in the TNF-alpha receptor-deficient mice. In vitro assessment of cultured fracture callus cells in comparison to primary articular chondrocytes showed that TNF-alpha treatment specifically induced the expression of MMP9, MMP14, VEGI, and Angiopoietin 2. These results suggest that TNF-alpha signaling in chondrocytes controls vascularization of cartilage through the regulation of angiopoietin and VEGI factors which play counterbalancing roles in the induction of growth arrest, or apoptosis in endothelial cells. Furthermore, TNF-alpha appears to regulate, in part, the expression of two key proteolytic enzymes, MMP 9 and MMP14 that are known to be crucial to the progression of vascularization and turnover of mineralized cartilage. Thus, TNF-alpha signaling in healing fractures appears to coordinate the expression of specific regulators of endothelial cell survival and metalloproteolytic enzymes and is essential in the transition and progression of the endochondral phase of fracture repair.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2005-03-23", "authors": ["WLehmann", "C MEdgar", "KWang", "T-JCho", "G LBarnes", "SKakar", "D TGraves", "J MRueger", "L CGerstenfeld", "T AEinhorn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2004.10.010"}

To our knowledge, however, few studies on the characteristics of the untreated calvaria regarding bone density, vessel topography, and their intra/interindividual variations and associations are available. The aims of this investigation were to (1) map the large vessel topography of the skull vault, (2) describe the parietal bones of the adult rabbit histologically and morphometrically, and (3) histologically compare untreated parietal bone with parietal bone that had been treated with a GBA device.\nTen adult untreated rabbits were microangiographed. General anesthesia was induced and the mediastinum was opened. Heparin and lidocaine were injected in the aorta followed by perfusion with India ink. After death, en bloc biopsies of the skull vault including the overlying soft tissues and dura mater were taken. The specimens were cleared with the Spalteholtz technique, microscopically examined, and digitally imaged. Thereafter, circular biopsies were harvested to obtain decalcified sections. In addition, sections from 14 GBA-treated rabbit skulls (of the same race, sex and age as the untreated animals) served as reference specimens for comparison. Histomorphometric examinations were carried out.\nIn the cleared specimens, all parietal bones were found to be supplied by one major branch of the meningeal artery. From each of these, separate branches supplied the dura wherein a fine vessel network covered the bone. No major vessels were found in the supracalvarial soft tissue. Numerous fine vessels were found within the periosteum and dura entering the cortical plates. The decalcified sections of the parietal bones revealed an outer and inner cortical plate enveloping a diploic space containing bone trabeculae, marrow tissue and larger sinusoids. Hollow connections were frequently found in both the outer and inner cortical plates in both the untreated and the GBA-treated specimens. These connections contained marrow tissue that extended to the periosteum and the dura. The morphometric measurements revealed similar proportions of cortical, trabecular, and marrow areas in the right and left untreated bones. The area of the outer cortical plate was significantly larger than the area of the inner cortical plate. Bone density was similar in the right and left untreated and GBA-treated specimens, as was the frequency and width of hollow connections through the cortical bone plates.\nThe symmetry between the left and right parietal bones concerning the large vessel topography and the histomorphometric parameters assessed was high. Hollow connections in the cortical plates were frequently found.

{"title": "Advances in breast reconstruction after mastectomy.", "abstract": "Over the past 40 years, surgical reconstruction of the breast following mastectomy has become an important aspect of the cancer patient's rehabilitation process. While the surgical emphasis remains on a cure for the cancer, experience with breast reconstruction has not demonstrated any increased rate of cancer recurrence, even when reconstruction is performed immediately following tumor resection. Advances in surgical technique and biotechnology have made post-mastectomy reconstruction possible. The development of silicone gel and saline-filled implants as well as tissue expanders has revolutionized breast reconstruction. The elucidation of musculocutaneous flaps now provides the surgeon with the ability to transfer adequate quantities of vascularized tissue to reconstruct the surgical defects. The advent of microsurgical techniques has provided an additional reconstructive option, with free tissue transfer allowing the plastic surgeon to move musculocutaneous flaps from remote or distant sites to reconstruct the defect. The option of having the reconstruction immediately following the mastectomy procedure is now available to the patient. When reviewing the anatomy of the breast region, the surgeon must consider the mammary gland, its vascular supply, and its lymphatic system. The surgical techniques involved in reconstruction after mastectomy include the use of breast implants and tissue expansion, as well as reconstruction with autogenous tissues. Reconstruction with autogenous tissues includes the use of latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap, transverse rectus abdominus musculocutaneous flap, free flap transfer, as well as nipple-areola reconstruction.

In this article, the surgical strategy and techniques are described, with further consideration of the oncologically relevant aspects.\nBetween March 1993 and July 2003, we performed laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in 56 patients with right colon carcinoma. Average age was 74.5 years (range, 17-92). We performed a standardized surgical procedure that included mobilization from the vascularized mesenteric bridges with a window technique, transection of the ileocolic lymphovascular pedicle, and lateral and proximal mobilization of the ileocecum, ascending colon, right flexure, and proximale transversum. After enlargement of one of the trocar incisions the exteriorized colon was resected and an extracorporeal anastomosis was performed in the standard manner.\nThere were no conversions to open. The mean operating time was 119 +/- 38 min, the mean length of resected colon was 27.8 +/- 4.48 cm, and the average width of the clear margins was 6.8 +/- 5.3 cm. One patient died. Lymph nodes were positive in 21 patients. The 5-year survival rate in the 48 patients who were operated on with curative intent was 75%. We have had two local recurrences. The overall 5-year mortality-free fraction was 63%. Cox multivariate analysis showed that the mortality-prognostic factors were tumor stage and length of resected colon, whereas Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the mortality-prognostic factors were positive lymph nodes and tumor stage.\nOur results show that laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for colon cancer can be performed safely. Complications and recurrence rates are comparable to those for left-sided laparoscopic and open procedures. Therefore, we recommend this procedure as the method of choice.

{"title": "Digital cushions in horses comprise coarse connective tissue, myxoid tissue, and cartilage but only little unilocular fat tissue.", "abstract": "Digital cushions were studied in horses with particular reference to vascularization, tissue constituents and matrix components. The cushions mainly resembled a network of coarse collagen bundles. The areas inbetween the bundles were replenished with loosely woven interstitial connective tissue, myxoid tissue, and fibrocartilage. Expected masses of fat lobules were missing: only solitary adipocytes or small groups of adipocytes were seen. Vascular supply to the cushions was remarkably poor. The mucinous myxoid matrix largely consisted of hyaluronan with little sulphated glycosaminoglycans. Myxoid cells were stellate or ramified in shape and showed a tendency to store glycogen and lipid droplets. Myxoid cells reacted for vimentin and stained for S-100 protein. Moreover, myxoid cells often reacted for neuron specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Myxoid tissue continuously transformed into loosely organized interstitial connective tissue with fibroblasts, which remained unreactive when tested for neuroectodermal markers. Myxoid tissue also was not clearly demarcated against irregularly interspersed islets of fibrocartilage or hyaline cartilage. Chondrocytes did not stain for neuron specific enolase but reactivity for S-100 protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein was noted in peripheral regions of fibrocartilage. Single or grouped unilocular fat cells were rarely placed into myxoid areas. Unilocular fat cells stained for vimentin, S-100 protein, and occasionally for glial fibrillary acidic protein but not for neuron specific enolase. Continuous transformation of myxoid tissue into cartilage together with corresponding reactivity for neuroectodermal marker proteins of myxoid cells and peripherally located chondrocytes suggest close relationship between myxoid cells and chondrocytes.

In order to study organ-specific functions in vitro or to make use of them in medical devices/treatments in the future, this natural architecture should be rebuilt. An important aspect in this context is the appropriate ratio of medium to cell volume being so far not optimally reestablished in most of the currently available in vitro systems. To improve such culture conditions, we constructed a microstructure to culture hepatocytes and (without any addition of extracellular matrix material) characterized liver tissue in the form of evenly sized aggregates. The liver-specific differentiation status of such aggregates was monitored by their ability to perform CYP450 dependent xenobiotic metabolism along with the measurement of albumin secretion. Freshly isolated adult rat hepatocytes show an initial loss of total CYP450 content and of associated activities (mixed function oxidases). However, in the aggregate system, this level did not decrease further but remained stable or even increased throughout the culture period of 10-13 days. The CYP450 dependent metabolism of the hepatocytes is able to respond to classic inducing agents. The described culture efficiently supports liver-specific functions of adult rat hepatocytes and seems to be suited not only for use in an extracorporeal liver device but also for the formation of evenly sized small aggregates to be of use in transplantation of differentiated liver tissue.

{"title": "Effects of rapamycin on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of human peritoneal mesothelial cells.", "abstract": "The preservation of the peritoneal membrane is crucial for long-term survival in peritoneal dialysis. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process demonstrated in mesothelial cells (MC), responsible for negative peritoneal changes and directly related to PD. EMT enables neovascularization and fibrogenic capabilities in MC. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the mediator for neo-vascularization. Rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressor with antifibrotic action in renal allografts and has a demonstrated anti-VEGF effect. We performed this study with the hypothesis that rapamycin may regulate the EMT of MC. MC from human omentum were cultured. When mesothelial cells reached confluence, some of them were stimulated with r-TGF-beta (1 ng/mL) to induce EMT, co-administered with rapamycin (0.2, 2, 4, 20 and 40 nM). Other groups of cells received similar doses of rapamycin or r-TGF-beta, separately. Cells were analyzed at 6, 24, 48 hours and 7 days. As markers of EMT we included alfa -SMA, E-cadherin and snail nuclear factor by quantitative RT-PCR. EMT markers and regulators demonstrated the following changes with rapamycin: E-cadherin (a protective gene for EMT) increased 2.5-fold relative to controls under 40 nM, at 24h. Importantly, rapamycin inhibited snail expression induced by TGF-beta at 6h, whereas TGF-beta increased snail 10-fold. At day 7, rapamycin showed no anti-EMT properties. An important decrease in alfa -SMA expression by MC after rapamycin addition was observed. In conclusion, rapamycin shows a mild protective effect on EMT, as it increases E-cadherin and decreases alfa -SMA expression.

Significance was defined at P < .05.\nIn thyroid nodules with diameter of 15 mm and smaller, the most reliable diagnostic criteria for malignancy were an irregular outline (sensitivity, 69.6%; specificity, 86.4%; P < .001), subcapsular location (sensitivity, 65.2%; specificity, 86.4%; P < .001), and increased intranodular vascularization (sensitivity, 69.6%; specificity, 87.9%; P < .01). For thyroid nodules larger than 15 mm in diameter, the accuracy of US diagnosis was much lower than that for smaller nodules. The only reliable criterion for cancer in this group was hypoechogenicity (sensitivity, 60.0%; specificity, 84.0%; P < .01).\nStudy findings indicate that US is most helpful in diagnosis of thyroid malignancy in thyroid nodules with diameter of 15 mm and smaller, with detection of irregular tumor outline, subcapsular location, and increased intranodular vascularization.", "journal": "Radiology", "date": "2005-03-17", "authors": ["AndrejLyshchik", "ValentinaDrozd", "YuriDemidchik", "ChristophReiners"], "doi": "10.1148/radiol.2352031942"}

In addition, the clinical outcome was followed for 1 year.\nThe study population consisted of 10 patients with bilateral Class I and II recessions at maxillary canines. In split-mouth design, the defects were randomly selected for recession coverage either by a microsurgical (test) or macrosurgical (control) approach. Immediately after the surgical procedures, and after 3 and 7 days of healing, fluorescent angiograms were performed to evaluate graft vascularization. In addition, the clinical parameters were assessed before the surgical intervention, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.\nThe results of the angiographic evaluation at test sites revealed a vascularization of 8.9+/-1.9% immediately after the procedure. After 3 days and after 7 days, the vascularization rose to 53.3+/-10.5% and 84.8+/-13.5%, respectively. The corresponding vascularization at control sites were 7.95+/-1.8%/44.5+/-5.7% and 64.0+/-12.3%, respectively. All the differences between test and control sites were statistically significant. The clinical measurements revealed a mean recession coverage of 99.4+/-1.7% for the test and 90.8+/-12.1% for the control sites after the first month of healing. Again, this difference was statistically significant. The percentage of root coverage both test and control sites remained stable during the first year at 98% and 90%, respectively.\nThe present controlled clinical study has demonstrated that in root surface coverage, a microsurgical approach substantially improved the vascularization of the grafts and the percentages of root coverage compared with applying a conventional macroscopic approach.", "journal": "Journal of clinical periodontology", "date": "2005-03-16", "authors": ["RinoBurkhardt", "Niklaus PLang"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-051X.2005.00660.x"}

The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether a neural component may be involved in the remote response. In the cheek pouch of anesthetized hamsters, methacholine (100 microM) was applied to the arteriole by micropipette for 5 s, and the arteriolar responses were measured at the site of application and at remote locations: 500 and 1,000 microm upstream from the application site. Superfusion with the local anesthetic bupivacaine attenuated a local dilatory response and abolished the conducted dilation response to methacholine. Localized micropipette application of bupivacaine 300 microm from the methacholine application site also attenuated the remote dilation but did not inhibit the local dilation. Blockade of neuromuscular transmission with botulinum neurotoxin A (1 U, 3 days), micropipette application of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor inhibitor CGRP-(8-37) (10 microM) 300 microm upstream from the methacholine application site, and denervation of the CGRP sensory nerve by 2 days of capsaicin treatment reduced the conducted dilation response to methacholine but did not affect the local dilatory response.

Studies of the effect of heat stress on the placental functions are limited to the ewes, but that on microscopic structure is unknown. In the present study, rats were exposed to 41 or 42 degrees C for 1 h on gestation day (GD) 9. The controls were sham treated. Fetuses and placentas were collected on GD 20. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and several craniofacial malformations were observed in the fetuses of the heat-treated group. The placentas of the 42 degrees C group were significantly lighter in weight than those of the control. Light microscopy (LM) revealed thickening, hyalinization and occasional lymphocytic infiltration of the decidua basalis. Giant cells were prominent and glycogen cells had degenerated, leaving behind large cysts in the basal (spongy) zone. Best's carmine stain with or without diastase indicated the reduction in number and degeneration of glycogen cells and cyst formation. The labyrinthine zone was relatively thin in comparison to that of the controls. Perivascular fibrosis and paucity of vascularization were other features of the placentas of the hyperthermia group. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed lipid droplet accumulation in the trophoblast, the presence of myelin bodies and an increased production of collagen in the basal zone. Perivascular fibrosis appeared to have contributed to placental barrier thickening. EM also revealed accumulation of glycogen and lipid droplets in the trophoblasts and fibrin secretion into the extracellular space of the labyrinthine zone.

{"title": "Self-assembling short oligopeptides and the promotion of angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Because an adequate blood supply to and within tissues is an essential factor for successful tissue regeneration, promoting a functional microvasculature is a crucial factor for biomaterials. In this study, we demonstrate that short self-assembling peptides form scaffolds that provide an angiogenic environment promoting long-term cell survival and capillary-like network formation in three-dimensional cultures of human microvascular endothelial cells. Our data show that, in contrast to collagen type I, the peptide scaffold inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis in the absence of added angiogenic factors, accompanied by enhanced gene expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF. In addition, our results suggest that the process of capillary-like network formation and the size and spatial organization of cell networks may be controlled through manipulation of the scaffold properties, with a more rigid scaffold promoting extended structures with a larger inter-structure distance, as compared with more dense structures of smaller size observed in a more compliant scaffold. These findings indicate that self-assembling peptide scaffolds have potential for engineering vascularized tissues with control over angiogenic processes.

The purpose of this study was to more clearly describe corneal vascularization by examining the architecture through three-dimensional reconstruction in order to find possible patterns in size, distribution, and location of blood vessels relative to gender, age, location, and season. Twenty-six eyes from 22 individuals were prepared for histologic examination and subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction. Every specimen examined had blood vessels in the cornea, comprising an average of 0.3% of total surface density (volume) of the cornea. No differences were found between individuals based on gender, age, and season. Environmental influences were not a significant factor either, which was not originally anticipated. The presence of vessels at the level of the anterior epithelium was surprising and it appeared that the vascularization was directed more anteriorly than was originally thought. The presence of blood vessels in a prenatal eye was also found. In all the eyes examined, no signs of injury or trauma could be observed. The presence of blood vessels appears to minimally impair vision based on their low density, size, and location. The association of vessels with the anterior epithelium and development of vessels within the fetus point to an evolutionary adaptation possibly due to the manatee's unique ability to move between water bodies.", "journal": "Veterinary ophthalmology", "date": "2005-03-15", "authors": ["Jennifer YHarper", "Don ASamuelson", "Roger LReep"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00351.x"}

Satellite cells (10(6) cells) obtained from hindlimb muscles of newborn female 2BAW Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal area of adult male rats. After 3, 7, and 14 days, the transplanted tissues (N = 4-5) were processed for histochemical analysis of peripheral nerves, inactive X-chromosome and acetylcholinesterase. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were also labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin. The development of ectopic muscles was successful in 86% of the implantation sites. By day 3, the transplanted cells were organized as multinucleated fibers containing multiple clusters of nAChRs (N = 2-4), resembling those from non-innervated cultured skeletal muscle fibers. After 7 days, the transplanted cells appeared as a highly vascularized tissue formed by bundles of fibers containing peripheral nuclei. The presence of X chromatin body indicated that subcutaneously developed fibers originated from female donor satellite cells. Differently from the extensor digitorum longus muscle of adult male rat (87.9 +/- 1.0 microm; N = 213), the diameter of ectopic fibers (59.1 microm; N = 213) did not obey a Gaussian distribution and had a higher coefficient of variation. After 7 and 14 days, the organization of the nAChR clusters was similar to that of clusters from adult innervated extensor digitorum longus muscle.

The pathogenesis may involve disruption of the normal equilibrium between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in and around the cornea. Thrombospondin (TSP) 1 and 2 are multifunctional matricellular glycoproteins with potent anti-angiogenic properties and are expressed by human keratocytes in a stromal wound repair model. We hypothesize that the synthesis of these anti-angiogenic proteins by keratocytes is inhibited by HSV1 and that such a mechanism may contribute to stromal vascularization in HSK.\nNonconfluent monolayers of human keratocytes were infected with HSV1 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 virus particles/keratocyte. Expression of TSP1 and TSP2 was determined by immunohistochemistry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h after infection (ai). Expression of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a control. Expression of immediate early and late viral proteins was also determined. Protein expression was quantified by densitometric analysis of the immunoblot bands.\nHuman keratocytes supported the growth of HSV1 at all times ai. TSP1 and TSP2 were downregulated as early as 4 h ai to a 50% reduction by 8 h (p<0.002), and were absent from 24 h ai (p<0.001). There was no change in the level of expression of GAPDH throughout the duration of the experiment. Immediate early viral proteins (HSV1:ICP27) could be detected from 6 h ai reaching maximum intensity 24 h ai and late proteins (HSV:1gD) were expressed from 24 h.\nThe synthesis of TSP1 and TSP2 is selectively downregulated by HSV1 infection in human keratocytes.

{"title": "Increased plasma MMP9 in integrin alpha1-null mice enhances lung metastasis of colon carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were developed as anticancer agents based on the observation that MMPs facilitate local tumor spread and metastasis by promoting matrix degradation and cell migration. Unfortunately, these inhibitors were unsuccessful in the clinical treatment of several cancers, including lung cancer. A possible reason contributing to their failure is that MMP activity is critical for the generation of inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis, including angiostatin. Thus, MMPs might play opposing roles in tumor vascularization and invasion. To determine which effect of elevated MMP levels dominates in the progression of metastatic cancer, experimental lung metastasis assays were performed in integrin alpha1-null mice, a genetic model for increased plasma levels of MMP9 and MMP9-generated angiostatin (Pozzi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000;97:2202-7). We show that while the number of lung colonies in integrin alpha1-null mice was significantly increased compared to their wild-type counterparts, tumor volume was markedly reduced. In vivo treatment with the MMP inhibitor doxycycline resulted in a significant decrease in the number of lung colonies in both genotypes, but the tumors that formed were bigger and more vascularized. Increased tumor vascularization paralleled decreased plasma levels of MMP9 and consequent decreased angiostatin synthesis. These results demonstrate that while inhibition of MMPs prevents and/or reduces tumor invasion and lung metastasis, it has the paradoxical effect of increasing the size and vascularization of metastatic tumors due to decreased generation of inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation. The continued growth of these large well-vascularized tumors may explain the poor efficacy of MMP inhibitors in lung cancer clinical trials.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2005-03-10", "authors": ["XiwuChen", "YanSu", "BarbaraFingleton", "HeathAcuff", "Lynn MMatrisian", "RoyZent", "AmbraPozzi"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.20997"}

In liver malignancies of childhood neoadjuvant chemotherapy is successfully combined with surgical treatment. Chemotherapy and local tumor ablation lead to characteristic histomorphologic changes: Complete destruction of the tumor tissue and its vascular bed is followed by encapsulated necroses. After selective eradication of the tumor cells under preservation of the fibrovasular bed the tumor is replaced by hypocellular edematous and fibrotic tissue. If completely damaged tumor tissue is absorbed quickly, the tumor area is replaced by regenerating liver tissue. Obliterating fibrohyalinosis of tumor vessels, and perivascular edema or necrosis indicate tissue damage along the vascular bed. Degenerative pleomorphism of tumor cells, steatosis, hydropic swelling and Malloryhyalin in HCC can represent cytologic findings of cytotoxic cellular damage. Macroscopic type of HCC influences significantly the response to treatment. Multinodular HCC often contain viable tumor nodules close to destroyed nodules after treatment. Encapsulated uninodular tumors undergo complete necrosis much easier. Large size and a tumor capsule limitate the effect of percutaneous injection of ethanol into HCC. In carcinomas with an infiltrating border, especially in metastases of adenocarcinomas and hepatic cholangiocarcinoma cytostatic treatment damages the tumor tissue mainly in the periphery. Nevertheless the infiltrating rim, portal veins, lymphatic spaces and bile ducts as well as the angle between liver capsule, tumor nodule and bordering parenchyma are the main refugees of viable tumor tissue even after high dosage regional chemotherapy. This local resistance is caused by special local conditions of vascularization and perfusion. These residues are the source of local tumor progression and distant metastases.

Xenotolerance was confirmed by subsequent transplantation of a vascularized hamster heart, measurement of xenoantibody formation, or mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR).\nSkin grafts were as effective as vascularized heart grafts to induce/maintain T-independent xenotolerance. Even without TR and despite being rejected themselves, xenoskin grafts lead to progressively developing xenononreactivity. Xenothymus transplantation induced xenotolerance in the T-dependent but not in the T-independent immune compartment, leading to rejection of subsequently transplanted hamster hearts by T-independent mechanisms (production of IgM but not IgG xenoantibodies (Xabs), presence of antihamster MLR nonresponsiveness). Combined skin and thymus xenotransplantation sensitized the T-cell compartment, leading to hyperacute rejection of subsequently transplanted hamster hearts.

NPY and its cognate receptors, Y1, Y2 and Y5, are expressed in neural crest-derived tumors; however, their role in regulation of growth is unknown. The effect of NPY on the growth and vascularization of neuroendocrine tumors was tested using three types of cells: neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT). The tumors varied in expression of NPY receptors, which was linked to differential functions of the peptide. NPY stimulated proliferation of neuroblastoma cells via Y2/Y5Rs and inhibited ESFT cell growth by Y1/Y5-mediated apoptosis. In both tumor types, NPY receptor antagonists altered basal growth levels, indicating a regulatory role of autocrine NPY. In addition, the peptide released from the tumor cells stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, which suggests its paracrine angiogenic effects. In nude mice xenografts, exogenous NPY stimulated growth of neuroblastoma tumors, whereas it increased apoptosis and reduced growth of ESFT. However, in both tumors, NPY treatment led to an increase in tumor vascularization. Taken together, this is the first report of NPY being a growth-regulatory factor for neuroendocrine tumors, acting both by autocrine activation of tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis and by angiogenesis.

The changes in cell proliferation and cell death/apoptosis, and vascularization in xenotransplanted follicles during follicular growth and development were analyzed histochemically at 1-26 weeks after operation. Follicles in grafted ovarian tissues grew rapidly forming an antral cavity (a hallmark of tertiary follicles) at 1 week after grafting. The diameter of the follicles in transplanted tissues ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mm, from 0.5 to 2.0 mm and from 0.5 to 3.0 mm at 1, 2 and 26 weeks after the operation, respectively. Histological observation of ovarian tissues at 26 weeks after grafting revealed that all grafts had abundant capillary vessels, which invaded from murine organs and surrounded the growing follicles.

The underlying mechanisms preventing acute rejection of B6.H-2bm12 heart allografts by C57BL/6 recipients were investigated. B6.H-2bm12 heart allografts induced low levels of alloreactive effector T cell priming in C57BL/6 recipients, and this priming was accompanied by low-level cellular infiltration into the allograft that quickly resolved. Recipients with long-term-surviving heart allografts were unable to reject B6.H-2bm12 skin allografts, suggesting potential down-regulatory mechanisms induced by the cardiac allografts. Depletion of CD25+ cells from C57BL/6 recipients resulted in 15-fold increases in alloreactive T cell priming and in acute rejection of B6.H-2bm12 heart grafts. Similarly, reconstitution of B6.Rag(-/-) recipients with wild-type C57BL/6 splenocytes resulted in acute rejection of B6.H-2bm12 heart grafts only if CD25+ cells were depleted. These results indicate that acute rejection of single class II MHC-disparate B6.H-2bm12 heart allografts by C57BL/6 recipients is inhibited by the emergence of CD25+ regulatory cells that restrict the clonal expansion of alloreactive T cells.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2005-03-08", "authors": ["SorenSchenk", "Danielle DKish", "ChunshuiHe", "TarekEl-Sawy", "EiseChiffoleau", "ChuangqiChen", "ZihaoWu", "SigridSandner", "Anton VGorbachev", "KiyotakaFukamachi", "Peter SHeeger", "Mohamed HSayegh", "Laurence ATurka", "Robert LFairchild"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.174.6.3741"}

The KS-associated herpesvirus/human herpes virus 8 open reading frame 74 encodes a constitutively active G protein-coupled receptor known as vGPCR that binds CXC chemokines with high affinity. In this study, we show that conditional transgenic expression of vGPCR by cells of endothelial origin triggers an angiogenic program in vivo, leading to development of an angioproliferative disease that resembles KS. This angiogenic program consists partly in the expression of the angiogenic factors placental growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor B, and inducible NO synthase by the vGPCR-expressing cells. Finally, we show that continued vGPCR expression is essential for progression of the KS-like phenotype and that down-regulation of vGPCR expression results in reduced expression of angiogenic factors and regression of the lesions. Together, these findings implicate vGPCR as a key element in KS pathogenesis and suggest that strategies to block its function may represent a novel approach for the treatment of KS.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2005-03-08", "authors": ["Kristian KJensen", "Denise JManfra", "Marcos GGrisotto", "Andrea PMartin", "GalyaVassileva", "KevinKelley", "Thue WSchwartz", "Sergio ALira"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.174.6.3686"}

{"title": "VAN3 ARF-GAP-mediated vesicle transport is involved in leaf vascular network formation.", "abstract": "Within the leaf of an angiosperm, the vascular system is constructed in a complex network pattern called venation. The formation of this vein pattern has been widely studied as a paradigm of tissue pattern formation in plants. To elucidate the molecular mechanism controlling the vein patterning process, we previously isolated Arabidopsis mutants van1 to van7, which show a discontinuous vein pattern. Here we report the phenotypic analysis of the van3 mutant in relation to auxin signaling and polar transport, and the molecular characterization of the VAN3 gene and protein. Double mutant analyses with pin1, emb30-7/gn and mp, and physiological analyses using the auxin-inducible marker DR5::GUS and an auxin transport inhibitor indicated that VAN3 may be involved in auxin signal transduction, but not in polar auxin transport. Positional cloning identified VAN3 as a gene that encodes an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation factor-guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (ARF-GAP). It resembles animal ACAPs and contains four domains: a BAR (BIN/amphiphysin/RVS) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an ARF-GAP domain and an ankyrin (ANK)-repeat domain. Recombinant VAN3 protein showed GTPase-activating activity and a specific affinity for phosphatidylinositols. This protein can self-associate through the N-terminal BAR domain in the yeast two-hybrid system. Subcellular localization analysis by double staining for Venus-tagged VAN3 and several green-fluorescent-protein-tagged intracellular markers indicated that VAN3 is located in a subpopulation of the trans-Golgi network (TGN).

Matricellular proteins, secreted macromolecules that interact with extracellular matrix proteins but do not in themselves serve structural roles, have been identified as important mediators of the foreign body response that includes inflammation, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis and assembly. In this report we delineate functions of hevin and SPARC, two homologs of the SPARC family of matricellular proteins, in the foreign body response. Despite their sequence similarity, hevin and SPARC mediate different aspects of this fibrotic response. Using mice with targeted gene deletions, we show that hevin is central to the progression of biomaterial-induced inflammation whereas SPARC regulates the formation of the collagenous capsule. Although vascular density within the capsule is unaltered in the absence of either protein, SPARC-hevin double-null capsules show substantially increased numbers of vessels, indicating compensatory functions for these two proteins in the inhibition of angiogenesis.

The animals were treated with intraperitoneal injections of SU6668 (75 mg/kg/day) immediately (five animals) or 7 days (five animals) following tumor implantation. Control mice received intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (50 microl dimethylsulfoxide) immediately (five animals) or 7 days (four animals) after tumor implantation. Tumor growth, angiogenesis, and microcirculation were assessed by performing intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy over a 14-day observation period. To assess the effects of SU6668 on overall survival, C6 glioma cells were implanted stereotactically into the brains of 24 additional animals and treatment was initiated on Day 7. In both the immediate and delayed experimental setting, SU6668 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of total and functional tumor vessel densities (both p < 0.05), reflecting a suppression of angiogenesis and impairment of tumor perfusion. As a consequence, tumor growth was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05). Histological analysis demonstrated reduced tumor growth and less mass effect on the adjacent brain of treated animals. The survival experiments confirmed the importance of our results in that survival was significantly prolonged following SU6668 therapy (p < 0.05).\nTargeting of multiple angiogenic signaling pathways by polyvalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors represents a promising strategy to interfere with the vascularization, microcirculation, and growth of angiogenesis-dependent tumors.

This article describes a system for generating capillary-like networks within a thick fibrin matrix. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, growing on the surface of microcarrier beads, were embedded in fibrin gels a known distance (Delta = 1.8-4.5 mm) from a monolayer of human dermal fibroblasts. The distance of the growth medium, which contained vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, from the beads, C, was varied from 2.7 to 7.2 mm. Capillaries with visible lumens sprouted in 2-3 days, reaching lengths that exceeded 500 microm within 6-8 days. On day 7, capillary network formation was largely independent of C; however, a strong inverse correlation with Delta was observed, with the maximum network formation at Delta = 1.8 mm. Surprisingly, the thickness of the gel was not a limiting factor for oxygen diffusion as these tissue constructs retained a relatively high oxygen tension of > 125 mmHg. We conclude that diffusion of oxygen in vitro is not limiting, allowing the development of tissue constructs on the order of centimeters in thickness. In addition, diffusion of fibroblast-derived soluble mediators is necessary for stable capillary formation, but is significantly impeded relative to that of nutrients present in the medium.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2005-03-02", "authors": ["Craig KGriffith", "CherylMiller", "Richard C ASainson", "Jay WCalvert", "Noo LiJeon", "Christopher C WHughes", "Steven CGeorge"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2005.11.257"}

In vivo induction of epidermal ODC enzyme activity significantly stimulated the vascularization of ODCER transgenic skin. Increased expression of interleukin-1beta and keratin 6, markers of keratinocyte activation seen in wound healing, was also observed in 4OHT-treated transgenic skin.

Further, to examine this tenet we have developed a novel murine model system in which in utero Ang2 gene delivery via a non-replicating adenoviral expression vector has the potential to manipulate the blood vessel phenotype in vivo during pregnancy. Ang2 overexpression selectively and rapidly remodels the labyrinth perivascular extracellular matrix, subsequently promoting plasticity of the maternal and fetal vessels, which appear honeycombed due to a 2-fold increase in blood vessel luminal area. High levels of Ang2 impair endothelial cell adhesiveness, leading to vascular leakiness with perivascular oedema, which increases placental weight. These observations suggest that the Ang2 overexpression may play a key role in placental vascular remodelling.

The purpose of this study was to identify donor cell engraftment in recipient lymphoid tissues after performing rat hind limb allograft.\nFifty-five whole-limb allotransplantations were performed in sex-mismatched pairs of rats. Syngeneic male Lewis and allogeneic Dark Agouti donors were transplanted to female Lewis recipients. FK506 was used for immunosuppression.

Chimerism was assessed at 1, 24, and 48 weeks after transplantation.\nThere was no rejection episode in any of the limb grafts. Although levels of chimerism were highly variable in each lymphoid tissue, a gradual increase was noticed in all during the course of time. At 1 week after the transplant period, only intrasplenic chimerism was at high level (1%) in three groups. At 48 weeks after the transplant, all recipients with allografts showed very high level (10%) of chimerism in the bone marrow. Two, two, and two of six recipients showed very high levels in the spleen, lymph node, and liver, respectively, at 48 weeks. Intrathymic chimerism was higher at 24 weeks after transplant rather than at 48 weeks.\nWe demonstrated donor cell engraftment into recipient lymphoid tissues after successful whole limb transplantation.

Rapid revascularization and subsequent bone remodeling may lead to improved outcomes. Surgical revascularization with arterovenous bundles (AV bundles) or vascularized bone grafts results in neoangiogenesis and bone remodeling. Gene transfer of an angiogenic factor to the vessel wall may be an additional strategy to further accelerate this process. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transfer to augment surgical revascularization of necrotic bone. An adenoviral vector, either with the VEGF gene (VEGF-A) or identical virus without the cDNA VEGF insert (ADV-DeltaE1) was used to transduce endothelial cells in rabbit saphenous arteries. The artery was then placed with its venae comitantes as an AV bundle into necrotic iliac crest bone in vivo. Angiogenesis in the necrotic bone was quantified by bone blood flow measurement and assessment of vessel density following microangiography. The extent of neoangiogenesis was significantly greater in the VEGF group than the control group at 1 week postoperatively.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society", "date": "2005-03-01", "authors": ["KosukeKatsube", "Allen TBishop", "Robert DSimari", "SeppoYl\u00e4-Herttuala", "Patricia FFriedrich"], "doi": "10.1016/j.orthres.2004.08.013"}

{"title": "Normal patterning of the coronary capillary plexus is dependent on the correct transmural gradient of FGF expression in the myocardium.", "abstract": "The formation of the coronary vessel system is vital for heart development, an essential step of which is the establishment of a capillary plexus that displays a density gradient across the myocardial wall, being higher on the epicardial than the endocardial side. This gradient in capillary plexus formation develops concurrently with transmural gradients of myocardium-derived growth factors, including FGFs. To test the role of the FGF expression gradient in patterning the nascent capillary plexus, an ectopic FGF-over-expressing site was created in the ventricular myocardial wall in the quail embryo via retroviral infection from E2-2.5, thus abolishing the transmural gradient of FGFs. In FGF virus-infected regions of the ventricular myocardium, the capillary density across the transmural axis shifted away from that in control hearts at E7. This FGF-induced change in vessel patterning was more profound at E12, with the middle zone becoming the most vascularized. An up-regulation of FGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 in epicardial and subepicardial cells adjacent to FGF virus-infected myocardium was also detected, indicating a paracrine effect on induction of vascular signaling components in coronary precursors. These results suggest that correct transmural patterning of coronary vessels requires the correct transmural expression of FGF and, therefore, FGF may act as a template for coronary vessel patterning.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2005-03-01", "authors": ["David JPennisi", "TakashiMikawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.12.028"}

The interest in these types of flaps has improved because recent clinical work advocates that fascial and fasciocutaneous flaps can be well indicated for bone coverage. The anatomical study of the medial adiposofascial flap is presented in this article. The flap is based on the rich vascular network supplied by the saphenous artery and the posterior tibial artery perforators. This flap can be harvested on the anteromedial aspect of the leg and can be mobilized to cover defects located between the patella and the heel. This multiple blood supply makes it possible to harvest this flap in various ways, so various defects can be covered. To confirm and prove the versatility and clinical value of this flap, the authors have studied a series of 22 cases in which this flap was used for coverage of lower leg defects. For these defects, especially when situated in the lower third or around the heel and ankle, coverage by a free flap is most often the only proposed solution. However, the authors have obtained excellent results in the majority of these cases, avoiding a free flap procedure. Moreover, in this way, the option of using a free flap remains possible if needed. There is minimal donor-site morbidity and a high functional and aesthetic outcome, making this flap a first-choice flap in selected cases of lower leg defects.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2005-02-26", "authors": ["OlivierHeymans", "NicolasVerhelle", "StephanePeters"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000152421.62240.b5"}

Progressive disease has been related to consortia of anaerobic bacteria, with the gram-negative organism Porphyromonas gingivalis particularly implicated. The gingipains, comprising a group of cysteine proteinases and associated hemagglutinin domains, are major virulence determinants of this organism. As vascular expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules is a critical determinant of tissue response to microbial challenge, the objective of this study was to determine the capacity of gingipains to modulate the expression and function of these receptors. Given the potential multifunctional role of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) in the vasculature, the effect of gingipains on PECAM-1 expression by endothelial cells was examined. Activated gingipains preferentially down-regulated PECAM-1 expression on endothelial cells compared with vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1, but the reduction in PECAM-1 expression was completely inhibited in the presence of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor TLCK (Nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone). Endothelial monolayers treated with activated gingipains demonstrated progressive intercellular gap formation that correlated with reduced intercellular junctional PECAM-1 expression as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. This was accompanied by enhanced transfer of both albumin and neutrophils across the monolayer. The results suggest that degradation of PECAM-1 by gingipains contributes to increased vascular permeability and neutrophil flux at disease sites.", "journal": "Infection and immunity", "date": "2005-02-26", "authors": ["Peter L WYun", "Arthur ADecarlo", "Cheryl CChapple", "NeilHunter"], "doi": "10.1128/IAI.73.3.1386-1398.2005"}

In 15 patients, follow-up examinations after stereotactic, single-dose radiotherapy were performed using CEUS (low mechanical index (MI), 2.4-ml SonoVue) and computed tomography (CT). Besides tumor size, the enhancement of the liver and the metastases was assessed at the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases. The sizes of the tumor and of a perifocal liver reaction after radiotherapy measured with CEUS significantly correlated with those measured at CT (r=0.93, p<0.001). CEUS found a significant reduction of the arterial vascularization in treated tumors (p<0.05). In the arterial phase, the perifocal liver tissue was hypervascularized compared to the treated tumor (p<0.001); in the late phase, it was less enhanced than the liver (p<0.001) and more than the tumor (p<0.01). The perifocal liver reaction was also seen in CT, but with a variable enhancement at the arterial (50% hyperdense compared to normal liver tissue), venous, or delayed phase (each with 70% hyperdense reactions). CEUS allows for the assessment of tumor and liver perfusion, in addition to morphological tumor examination, which was comparable with CT. Thus, changes of tumor perfusion, which may indicate tumor response, as well as the perifocal liver reaction after radiotherapy, which must be differentiated from perifocal tumor growth, can be sensitively visualized using CEUS.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2005-02-25", "authors": ["MKrix", "CPlathow", "MEssig", "KHerfarth", "JDebus", "H-UKauczor", "SDelorme"], "doi": "10.1007/s00330-004-2620-x"}

{"title": "Inflammation-mediated dysfunction and apoptosis in pancreatic islet transplantation: implications for intrahepatic grafts.", "abstract": "Recent advances in clinical protocols have improved the outcomes of pancreatic islet transplantation (PIT), yet PIT recipients typically require pancreatic islet grafts derived from multiple donors to achieve insulin independence. This along with experimental models of syngeneic PIT, showing that up to 60% of pancreatic islet tissue undergoes apoptosis within the first several days post-transplantation, strongly suggest the involvement of nonalloantigen-specific, inflammatory events in partial destruction of the graft following PIT. Interleukin-1beta appears to be among the most important inflammatory mediators, causing pancreatic islet dysfunction and apoptosis through the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. Kupffer cells secrete many molecules, including cytokines, NO, and free radicals, which are known to be directly toxic to the pancreatic islets, and depletion or inhibition of Kupffer cells improves outcomes following experimental PIT. Immediately after transplantation, the pancreatic islets are perfused only by portal vein blood until the process of angiogenesis restores arterial blood flow some 7-10 days later. This delayed vascularization may have implications for the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, the effects of free radicals, and the role of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Finally, in the immediate post-transplant period, hepatocytes may contribute to pancreatic islet injury through the production of NO.

{"title": "Targeting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) as a therapeutic strategy for CNS disorders.", "abstract": "Hypoxia occurs when oxygen availability drops below the levels necessary to maintain normal rates of metabolism. Because of its high metabolic activity, the brain is highly sensitive to hypoxia. Severe or prolonged oxygen deprivation in the brain contributes to the damage associated with stroke and a variety of other neuronal disorders. Conversely, the extreme hypoxic environment found in the core of many brain tumors supports the growth of the tumor and the survival of tumor cells. Normal cells exposed to transient or moderate hypoxia are generally able to adapt to the hypoxic conditions largely through activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF. HIF-regulated genes encode proteins involved in energy metabolism, cell survival, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and vasomotor regulation. In many instances of hypoxia or hypoxia and ischemia, the induction of HIF target genes may be beneficial. When these same insults occur in tissues that are normally poorly vascularized, such as the retina and the core of solid tumors, induction of the same HIF target genes can promote disease.

The G-CSF treatment did not affect initial infarct size at 3 d but improved cardiac function as early as 1 week after myocardial infarction. Moreover, the beneficial effects of G-CSF on cardiac function were reduced by delayed start of the treatment. G-CSF induced antiapoptotic proteins and inhibited apoptotic death of cardiomyocytes in the infarcted hearts. G-CSF also reduced apoptosis of endothelial cells and increased vascularization in the infarcted hearts, further protecting against ischemic injury. All these effects of G-CSF on infarcted hearts were abolished by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant Stat3 protein in cardiomyocytes.

In addition, lenses of transgenic mice with ectopic expression of norrin show significantly more capillaries in the hyaloid vasculature that surrounds the lens during development. In vitro, lenses of transgenic mice in coculture with microvascular endothelial cells induce proliferation of the cells.

The purity of islet preparation was better with pancreata from adult than young donors (86% vs. 64%, respectively, P < 0.05). A lack of engraftment was observed for small islets from young pig donors as compared with large islets from adult donors.\nLarge and well-structured islets, mainly found in adult pig pancreata, probably possess a better potential for cellular engraftment due to centralized vascularization and collagen distribution.", "journal": "Pancreas", "date": "2005-02-17", "authors": ["DDufrane", "R MGoebbels", "IFdilat", "YGuiot", "PGianello"], "doi": "10.1097/01.mpa.0000147083.62501.4e"}

To study this we developed a mouse model that recapitulates the clinical aspects of live autograft and processed allograft healing. Gene expression analyses showed that there is a substantial decrease in the genes encoding RANKL and VEGF during allograft healing. Loss-of-function studies showed that both factors are required for autograft healing. To determine whether addition of these signals could stimulate allograft vascularization and remodeling, we developed a new approach in which rAAV can be freeze-dried onto the cortical surface without losing infectivity. We show that combination rAAV-RANKL- and rAAV-VEGF-coated allografts show marked remodeling and vascularization, which leads to a new bone collar around the graft. In conclusion, we find that RANKL and VEGF are necessary and sufficient for efficient autograft remodeling and can be transferred using rAAV to revitalize structural allografts.", "journal": "Nature medicine", "date": "2005-02-16", "authors": ["HiromuIto", "MetteKoefoed", "PraropTiyapatanaputi", "KirillGromov", "J JeffreyGoater", "JonathanCarmouche", "XinpingZhang", "Paul TRubery", "JosephRabinowitz", "R JudeSamulski", "TakashiNakamura", "KjeldSoballe", "Regis JO'Keefe", "Brendan FBoyce", "Edward MSchwarz"], "doi": "10.1038/nm1190"}

Pathologically BPH is characterized by an increased proliferation of stromal and acinar cells, sustained by increased vascularization (neoangiogenesis). Recent studies have also shown that finasteride reduces angiogenesis and prostatic bleeding associated with BPH. Reducing the volume as a final step in reducing neoangiogenesis could thus represent a fundamental advance in limiting intra- and postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).\nOur study included 60 patients undergoing TURP between January 2001 and January 2002. Of the patients, 30 received pretreatment with finasteride while 30 did not undergo any pretreatment (control group). In all the patients we evaluated the degree of peri-surgical bleeding, intended as a reduction in hemoglobin values in the 24 h following surgery.\nIn the group of patients pretreated with finasteride, blood loss, evaluated as a reduction in hemoglobin values, was minimal, and none of the patients required blood transfusion. The average hemoglobin loss in the 24 h following surgery was 0.9%. In the control group (average age 67 years), 4 patients (12%) required blood transfusion. The loss of hemoglobin was 2.36%. Finasteride, therefore, seems to play a fundamental role in the pretreatment of TURP patients, since by reducing dihydrotestosterone synthesis, it interacts with endothelial growth factors, thus reducing angiogenesis and preventing bleeding.", "journal": "Urologia internationalis", "date": "2005-02-16", "authors": ["GCrea", "GSanfilippo", "GAnastasi", "CMagno", "CVizzini", "AInferrera"], "doi": "10.1159/000082709"}

{"title": "VEGF directs newly gastrulated mesoderm to the endothelial lineage.", "abstract": "Herein, we investigated the role of VEGF signaling in the earliest events in vasculogenesis and found that it exerts critical effects shortly after mesodermal cells form by gastrulation. We showed that VEGF treatment of embryos caused an increase in the population of newly gastrulated mesodermal (NGM) cells that express the transcription factor TAL1. This increase in TAL1-positive cells was attributed to VEGF induction of VEGF receptor-2 (Flk1)-positive NGM cells that would normally not have been induced due to the limited availability of VEGF in the NGM. Evidence that VEGF-mediated induction of NGM cells is relevant to the endothelial lineage is the finding that induced TAL1-positive cells in the NGM formed ectopic structures whose cells exhibited characteristics of endothelial cells, including the ability to integrate into the vascular network and express the QH1 antigen. Finally, we showed that VEGF-induced TAL1 expression in the NGM which resulted in the formation of ectopic structures was mediated by Flk1 but not Flt1 signaling. In summary, we have established that VEGF signaling is critical to allocation of NGM to the endothelial lineage.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2005-02-15", "authors": ["P BrianGiles", "Casey LCandy", "Paul AFleming", "Russell WOwens", "W ScottArgraves", "Christopher JDrake"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.12.011"}

Ingrowth of the coronary arteries into the aorta has recently been linked to apoptosis. This study was set up to examine the effect of an inhibition of epicardial outgrowth on apoptotic patterning and coronary development. Epicardial outgrowth was blocked at HH15-17 in quail embryos, which survived until HH25-35 (n=33). Embryos with complete inhibition of outgrowth did not survive after HH29. These embryos presented with thin compact myocardium, devoid of vessels. In embryos with delayed epicardial outgrowth the phenotype was less severe, and surviving embryos were studied up to HH35. In these embryos, myocardial vascularization was poor and apoptosis in the peritruncal region at HH30 was diminished. Embryos at HH35 displayed an abnormal coronary network and absent coronary orifices. In a further set of experiments (n=10), outgrowth was inhibited in chicken embryos at HH15, followed by transplantation of a quail proepicardial organ into the pericardial cavity to rescue cardiac phenotype. These chimeras were studied at HH29 and HH35. Myocardial development was restored; however, in 3 of 4 embryos (HH35), the coronary orifices were absent. Examination of double stainings of quail-chicken chimeras revealed that EPDCs produce Fas ligand as an apoptotic inductor at sites of coronary ingrowth. In the absence of proper timing of epicardial outgrowth, myocardial development and vascularization are disturbed. Also apoptosis in the peritruncal region is diminished.

{"title": "Vascularization of melanoma by mobilization and remodeling of preexisting latent vessels to patency.", "abstract": "Tumors must manipulate the host vasculature to provide a blood supply adequate for their proliferation. Although tumors may arise as avascular masses, there is increasing evidence that some tumors begin to proliferate by first co-opting preexisting host blood vessels. By fluorescent vascular imaging, we provide evidence that the vasculature in orthotopically implanted melanoma arises from a preexisting red cell-deficient vascular network that remodels to patency to accommodate the requirements of the expanding tumor mass. Topical application of vascular endothelial growth factor to vascular beds generated immediate and robust vascular transitions that were morphologically similar to tumor-induced transitions. N(phi)-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide inhibitor, significantly inhibited the growth of a syngeneic K1735M2 melanoma by reducing blood supply to the tumor by a mechanism independent of endothelial cell proliferation.

We assessed the effect of dietary acetylsalicylic and salicylic acid against dimethylbenzanthracene-induced rat tumours. Tumour angiogenesis was also investigated to explore the mechanism responsible for salicylate effect. Mammary tumours were induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats fed with different amounts of acetylsalicylic and salicylic acid. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were measured and vascularization of basement membrane proteins injected in vivo (Matrigel) was determined by evaluation of haemoglobin content to assess the extent to which angiogenesis was inhibited. Dimethylbenzanthracene-induced carcinogenesis was inhibited by both acids and there was a log-dose/response correlation between the tumour diameter and salicylate concentration. Salicylic acid seems more effective than acetylsalicylic acid. Vascular endothelial growth factor was less concentrated in treated animals than in the controls and so was Matrigel haemoglobin. The mechanism involved, however, is still uncertain, though concomitant inhibition of tumour angiogenesis may be an important component. The documented salicylate serum VEGF modulation is interesting also for presence of the flk-1 receptor in mammary tumour cells of our model.

A total of 28 patients with clinically enlarged lymph nodes were included in this study. Contrast-enhanced CCDS was performed on each patient. The color signals from nodes <15 mm in diameter were analyzed with a specialized computer program. Each node was later examined through immunohistochemical staining. Vascularization as shown by unenhanced CCDS was significantly greater in metastatic lymph nodes than in reactively enlarged lymph nodes (8.66% versus 2.81%; p = .01). The maximum vascularization area after contrast injection did not show any significant change (26.61% versus 28.63%; p = .75).

Because of the unique ability of live 3D TTE to systematically section and view the contents of an intracardiac mass, LA myxomas in the three patients studied could be more confidently diagnosed by noting isolated echolucent areas consistent with hemorrhage/necrosis in the tumor mass. On the other hand, a definite echolucent area was found by 2D TTE in only two of the three patients with myxoma. In the fourth patient with a hemangioma, live 3D TTE showed much more extensive and closely packed echolucencies with little solid tissue as compared to a myxoma consistent with a highly vascularized tumor.

The thickness of the vascularized mucous membranes in the nasal cavity was obtained up to 6 mm; the surface was smooth and well defined. The paranasal lining was invisible in computed tomography (CT) images because of its thin layer.

{"title": "Bone quality and healing in a swine vascularized bone allotransplantation model using cyclosporine-based immunosuppression therapy.", "abstract": "Although vascularized bone and joint allotransplantation is a promising new treatment option for reconstructing large bone defects, the need for immunosuppressive agents to prevent rejection in these procedures poses a major problem. This problem stems from the fact that several of these agents can cause harmful side effects, such as alterations in bone quality and healing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine what effect the commonly used immunosuppressant regimen cyclosporine A-based combination therapy has on bone quality and healing. In 10 pigs, vascularized bone allografts with skin and muscle components (osteomyocutaneous free flaps) were transplanted from size-matched donor animals. Recipient animals received oral cyclosporine A/mycophenolate mofetil/prednisone therapy for 90 days. Bone quality was studied before and after transplantation by measuring the bone's acoustic velocity and density and calculating the bone's elastic coefficient. Bone healing was assessed using radiographic analysis. Four animals were lost as a result of graft rejection or immunosuppression-related complications before the 90-day endpoint of the study. Although bone specimens taken from the six animals that completed the 90-day protocol had histological signs of rejection, they all seemed to have normal bone healing. Posttransplant bone density values were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) (1544.7 +/- 47.5 kg/m3) as compared with pretransplant values (1722.7 +/- 44.1 kg/m3). Results of the acoustic velocity and elastic coefficients measurements showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in posttransplant values (from 3503.0 +/- 165.1 meters/sec to 2963.0 +/- 54.6 meters/sec and from 21.6 +/- 2.2 GPa to 13.6 +/- 0.5 GPa, respectively), indicating diminished bone quality. The findings indicate that cyclosporine A/mycophenolate mofetil/prednisone combination therapy is ineffective in preventing bone rejection, that it decreases bone quality, and that it is associated with systemic toxicity, suggesting that this immunosuppressive regimen at the doses used in this study is not ideal for vascularized bone allotransplantation procedures.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2005-02-05", "authors": ["MariekeVossen", "JeanEdelstein", "Ramsey KMajzoub", "ClaudioMaldonado", "GustavoPerez-Abadia", "Michael JVoor", "HaldunOrhun", "TaskinTecimer", "CedricFrancois", "MosheKon", "John HBarker"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000148373.86487.04"}

Absence of suitable donor sites and the large dimensions of the defects limit the use of local nasal flaps in this region. Regional paranasal flaps may not be suitable in these cases because of color, texture, and donor-site scars. The composite procerus muscle and nasal skin flap, which is vascularized by the dorsal nasal branch of the angular artery, can be a useful treatment modality for proximal nasal reconstruction. Seven patients were successfully treated using the composite nasal flaps. The maximal size of the defects was 2.4 cm. In one case, the composite nasal flap was readvanced to close a new defect resulting from reexcision. The composite nasal flap has several advantages in reconstruction of proximal nasal defects. Reconstruction is performed with the same tissue and the donor defect is closed primarily.

On the basis of an anatomic investigation, the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with attached lateral intermuscular septum of the thigh was identified as a new candidate for microneurovascular free muscle transfer. The authors performed one-stage transfer of the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with a long motor nerve for reanimation of established facial paralysis in seven patients. The dominant nutrient vessels of the short head were the profunda perforators (second or third) in six patients and the direct branches from the popliteal vessels in one patient. The recipient vessels were the facial vessels in all cases. The length of the motor nerve of the short head ranged from 10 to 16 cm, and it was sutured directly to several zygomatic and buccal branches of the contralateral facial nerve in six patients. One patient required an interpositional nerve graft of 3 cm to reach the suitable facial nerve branches on the intact side. The period required for initial voluntary movement of the transferred muscles ranged from 4 to 10 months after the procedures. The period of postoperative follow-up ranged from 5 to 42 months. Transfer of the vascularized innervated short head of the biceps femoris muscle is thought to be an alternative for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face because of the reliable vascular anatomy of the muscle and because it allows two teams to operate together without the need to reposition the patient. The nerve to the short head of the biceps femoris enters the side opposite the vascular pedicle of the muscle belly, and this unique relationship between the vascular pedicle and the motor nerve is anatomically suitable for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face. As much as to 16 cm of the nerve can be harvested, and the nerve is long enough to reach the contralateral intact facial nerve in almost all cases. The lateral intermuscular septum, which is attached to the short head, provides \"anchor/suture-bearing\" tissue, allowing reliable fixations to the zygoma and the upper and lower lips to be achieved. In addition, the scar and deformity of the donor site are acceptable, and loss of this muscle does not result in donor-site dysfunction.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2005-02-05", "authors": ["AkiteruHayashi", "YuMaruyama"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000149405.89201.9e"}
{"title": "ACTH depletion represses vascular endothelial-cadherin transcription in mouse adrenal endothelium in vivo.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) is an endothelial cell-specific adhesion protein that is localised at cell-cell contacts. This molecule is an important determinant of vascular architecture and endothelial cell survival. In the adrenal cortex, steroidogenic and endothelial cells form a complex architecture. The adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) regulates gland homeostasis whose secretion is subjected to a negative feedback by adrenocorticosteroids. The aim of the present study was to determine whether VE-cadherin expression in the adrenal gland was regulated by hormonal challenge. We demonstrated that VE-cadherin protein levels were dramatically decreased (23.5+/-3.7%) by dexamethasone injections in the mouse and were restored by ACTH within 7 days (94.9+/-18.6%). Flow cytometry analysis of adrenal cells showed that the ratios of endothelial versus total adrenal cells were identical (35%) in dexamethasone- or ACTH-treated or untreated mice, suggesting that VE-cadherin expression could be regulated by ACTH. We demonstrate the existence of a transcriptional regulation of the VE-cadherin gene using transgenic mice carrying the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene under the control of the VE-cadherin promoter. Indeed, the promoter activity in the adrenals, but not in the lung or liver, was decreased in response to dexamethasone treatment (40+/-1.3%) and was partially restored after gland regeneration by ACTH injection (82+/-3%). In conclusion, our results show that transcription of a specific endothelial gene is controlled by the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and the data expand the knowledge regarding the role of ACTH in the regulation of the adrenal vascular network.", "journal": "Journal of molecular endocrinology", "date": "2005-02-05", "authors": ["PhilippeHuber", "ChristineMallet", "ElodieFaure", "ChristineRampon", "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8nePrandini", "OlivierF\u00e9raud", "St\u00e9phanieBouillot", "IsabelleVilgrain"], "doi": "10.1677/jme.1.01641"}
{"title": "Regulation of gene expression in endothelial cells: the role of human follicular fluid.", "abstract": "A precise regulation of angiogenesis is a prerequisite for an adequate maturation of ovarian follicles. Despite the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by granulosa cells in antral follicles, angiogenesis is restricted to the theca cell layer. The maturing follicle remains avascular before ovulation, implying regulatory mechanisms which prevent premature follicular vascularization. In order to investigate the role of follicular fluid and of granulosa cells in the regulation of endothelial gene expression, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in vitro with media conditioned with human follicular fluid obtained from individual patients undergoing oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization procedures or with culture medium conditioned by human granulosa cells respectively. Using microarray technology, the gene expression pattern was compared between untreated monolayers of HUVECs and HUVECs treated either with follicular fluid or with granulosa cell conditioned media. We identified a total of 15 genes that were significantly up-regulated and 11 genes that were significantly down-regulated in endothelial cells treated with follicular fluid at least 2.5-fold in more than 70% of comparisons. Up-regulated genes involved in angiogenesis were the anti-angiogenic factors gro-beta (16.5-fold), angiopoietin-2 (3.9-fold), alpha-2-macroglobulin (24.3-fold) and the pro-angiogenic factors E-selectin (5.3-fold) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (4.4-fold), whereas a significant down-regulation of the pro-angiogenic genes fibulin-5 (3.5-fold) and elastin (14.9-fold) could be observed. Culturing of HUVECs with conditioned medium from cultured human luteinized granulosa cells demonstrated a similar regulatory pattern of gene expression for fibulin-5, elastin, gro-beta, and E-selectin. The gene regulation in endothelial cells by follicular fluid could be confirmed by RT-PCR for gro-beta, angiopoietin-2, elastin, fibulin-5, and E-selectin. The present work reveals that compounds secreted by granulosa cells lead to the expression of anti-angiogenic factors on the transcript level in endothelial cells and thus could help to explain the temporal and spatial discrepancy between the high expression of VEGF and the restricted angiogenesis in the preovulatory follicle.", "journal": "Journal of molecular endocrinology", "date": "2005-02-05", "authors": ["RGruemmer", "LKlein-Hitpass", "JNeulen"], "doi": "10.1677/jme.1.01589"}

By using a mouse molecular genetics approach, we overexpressed Ang1 in the mouse forebrain and observed increases in overall vascularization, consistent with prior reports describing the role of Ang1. Nonvascular events, involving alterations in the dendritic organization of layer II motor cortex neurons, dentate granule cells, and pyramidal cells of CA1, were seen, suggesting that Ang1 was able to influence the growth of these processes.

Of the two mammalian Notch receptors expressed in vascular endothelium, Notch1 is broadly expressed in diverse cell types, whereas Notch4 is preferentially expressed in endothelial cells. As mechanisms that confer Notch4 expression were unknown, we investigated how NOTCH4 transcription is regulated in human endothelial cells and in transgenic mice. The NOTCH4 promoter and the 5' portion of NOTCH4 assembled into an endothelial cell-specific histone modification pattern. Analysis of NOTCH4 primary transcripts in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that 36% of the cells transcribed one or both NOTCH4 alleles. The NOTCH4 promoter was sufficient to confer endothelial cell-specific transcription in transfection assays, but intron 1 or upstream sequences were required for expression in the vasculature of transgenic mouse embryos. Cell-type-specific activator protein 1 (AP-1) complexes occupied NOTCH4 chromatin and conferred endothelial cell-specific transcription. Vascular angiogenic factors activated AP-1 and reprogrammed the endogenous NOTCH4 gene in HeLa cells from a repressed to a transcriptionally active state. These results reveal an AP-1-Notch4 pathway, which we propose to be crucial for transducing angiogenic signals and to be deregulated upon aberrant signal transduction in cancer.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2005-02-03", "authors": ["JingWu", "FumikoIwata", "Jeffrey AGrass", "Cameron SOsborne", "LauraElnitski", "PeterFraser", "OsamuOhneda", "MasayukiYamamoto", "Emery HBresnick"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.25.4.1458-1474.2005"}
{"title": "Encapsulation of Islets in Rough Surface, Hydroxymethylated Polysulfone Capillaries Stimulates VEGF Release and Promotes Vascularization after Transplantation.", "abstract": "The transplantation of encapsulated islets of Langerhans is one approach to treat type 1 diabetes without the need of lifelong immunosuppression. Capillaries have been used for macroencapsulation because they have a favorable surface-to-volume ratio and because they can be refilled. It is unclear at present whether the outer surface of such capillaries should be smooth to prevent, or rough to promote, cell adhesions. In this study we tested a new capillary made of modified polysulfone (MWCO: 50 kDa) with a rough, open-porous outer surface for islet transplantation. Compared with free-floating islets, encapsulation of freshly isolated rat islets affected neither the kinetics nor the efficiency of glucose-induced insulin release in perifusion experiments. Free-floating islets maintained insulin secretion during cell culture but encapsulated islets gradually lost their glucose responsiveness and released VEGF. This indicated hypoxia in the capillary lumen. Transplantation of encapsulated rat islets into diabetic rats significantly reduced blood glucose concentrations from the first week of implantation. This hypoglycaemic effect persisted until explantation 4 weeks later. Transplantation of encapsulated porcine islets into diabetic rats reduced blood glucose concentrations depending on the islet purity. With semipurified islets a transient reduction of blood glucose concentrations was observed (2, 8, 18, 18 days) whereas with highly purified islets a sustained normoglycaemia was achieved (more than 28 days). Explanted capillaries containing rat islets were covered with blood vessels. Vascularization was also observed on capillaries containing porcine islets that were explanted from normoglycaemic rats. In contrast, on capillaries containing porcine islets that were explanted from hyperglycemic rats a fibrous capsule and lymphocyte accumulations were observed. No vascularization on the surface of transplanted capillaries was observed in the absence of islets. In conclusion, encapsulated islets can release VEGF, which appears to be an important signal for the vascularization of the capillary material. The rough, open-porous outer surface of the polysulfone capillary provides a site well suited for vascular tissue formation and may allow a prolonged islet function after transplantation.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2005-02-01", "authors": ["NLembert", "JWesche", "PPetersen", "MDoser", "PZschocke", "H DBecker", "H P TAmmon"], "doi": "10.3727/000000005783983232"}

OIR was produced in TNF-alpha-/- and wild-type (WT) control C57B6 neonatal mice by exposure to 75% oxygen between postnatal days 7 and 12 (P7 to P12). Half of each WT litter was treated with the cytokine inhibitor semapimod (formerly known as CNI-1493) (5 mg/kg) by daily intraperitoneal injection from the time of reintroduction to room air at P12 until P17. The extent of preretinal neovascularization and intraretinal revascularization was quantified by image analysis of retinal flat-mounts and retinal hypoxia correlated with vascularization by immunofluorescent localization of the hypoxia-sensitive drug pimonidazole (hypoxyprobe, HP). HP adducts were also characterized by Western analysis and quantified by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TNF-alpha-/- and WT mice showed a similar sensitivity to hyperoxia-induced retinal ischemia at P12. At P13 some delay in early reperfusion was evident in TNF-alpha-/- and WT mice treated with semapimod. However, at P17 both these groups had significantly better vascular recovery with less ischemic/hypoxic retina and preretinal neovascularization compared to untreated retinopathy in WT mice. Immunohistochemistry showed deposition of HP in the avascular inner retina but not in areas underlying preretinal neovascularization, indicating that such aberrant vasculature can reduce retinal hypoxia.

UUC was performed by mobilizing the right pre-vesical divided ureter up to the pelvi-ureteric junction and a high retroperitoneal crossover to the divided left ureter. A stoma was created with a circular 2-cm skin excision and resecting the fatty subcutaneous tissue. Wrapped by the omentum, both well-vascularized ureteric stumps were pulled through a cross-like fascia incision up to skin level. Spatulated and everted, the 'butterfly' flaps were fixed to the skin and underlying omentum.

{"title": "Weight loading young chicks inhibits bone elongation and promotes growth plate ossification and vascularization.", "abstract": "The mechanical stimuli resulting from weight loading play an important role in mature bone remodeling. However, the effect of weight loading on the developmental process in young bones is less well understood. In this work, chicks were loaded with bags weighing 10% of their body weight during their rapid growth phase. The increased load reduced the length and diameter of the long bones. The average width of the bag-loaded group's growth plates was 75 +/- 4% that of the controls, and the plates showed increased mineralization. Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and longitudinal cell counting of mechanically loaded growth plates showed narrowed expression zones of collagen types II and X compared with controls, with no differences between the relative proportions of those areas. An increase in osteopontin (OPN) expression with loading was most pronounced at the bone-cartilage interface. This extended expression overlapped with tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and with the front of the mineralized matrix in the chondro-osseous junction. Moreover, weight loading enhanced the penetration of blood vessels into the growth plates and enhanced the gene expression of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP9 and MMP13 in those growth plates. On the basis of these results, we speculate that the mechanical strain on the chondrocytes in the growth plate causes overexpression of OPN, MMP9, and MMP13. The MMPs enable penetration of the blood vessels, which carry osteoclasts and osteoblasts. OPN recruits the osteoclasts to the cartilage-bone border, thus accelerating cartilage resorption in this zone and subsequent ossification which, in turn, contributes to the observed phenotype of narrower growth plate and shorter bones.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2005-01-29", "authors": ["AReich", "NJaffe", "ATong", "ILavelin", "OGenina", "MPines", "DSklan", "ANussinovitch", "EMonsonego-Ornan"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.01073.2004"}

Since explants are grown in serum-free media and are not perfused, we hypothesized that VEGF secreted by renal epithelia may induce their proliferation in an autocrine manner and chemoattract endothelial cells.\nTo test these hypotheses, we analyzed VEGF-mediated responses in vitro using several renal epithelial cell lines [immortalized rat proximal tubular cells (IRPT), transformed mouse proximal tubular cells (tsMPT), and normal rat kidney cells (NRK-52E)] expressing VEGF receptors (VEGFR).\nWe demonstrated that VEGFR-2 phosphorylates upon human recombinant VEGF (rhVEGF) exposure, indicating that VEGFR-2 is the signaling receptor. All three cell lines secreted VEGF into the media as indicated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. We showed that these tubular epithelial cells chemoattract endothelial cells when cocultured in vitro and that the chemoattraction is abolished by anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody. rhVEGF (10 ng/mL) induced a mitogenic effect similar to 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as assessed by H(3)-thymidine incorporation and elicited 30% decrease in apoptosis as determined by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining.\nThese in vitro studies indicate that (1) tubular epithelial cells chemoattract endothelial cells in a paracrine fashion by secreting VEGF, and (2) VEGF stimulates proliferation and promotes survival of renal epithelial cells in an autocrine manner via VEGFR-2.

The physiological role TSP1 plays in modulation of PECAM-1 expression and function during vascular development and angiogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that PECAM-1 undergoes alternative splicing in its cytoplasmic domain generating eight isoforms in the retinal vasculature of wild type and TSP1-/- mice. All PECAM-1 isoforms examined contained exon 13. The frequency of PECAM-1 isoform(s) containing exon 14 was significantly higher during early stages of retinal vascularization, which decreased during later stages of retinal vascularization in wild type mice. In contrast, the frequency of exon 14 containing PECAM-1 isoform(s) did not significantly change during retinal vascularization in TSP1-/- mice. They consistently expressed higher number of isoforms with exon 14 during later stages of retinal vascularization. The higher level of PECAM-1 isoforms with exon 14 was also observed in cultured TSP1-/- retinal EC compared to wild type retinal EC. This was consistent with increased amounts of Src and SHP-2 associated with PECAM-1, and enhanced migration and proliferation in TSP1-/- retinal EC.

In the present study, we analysed the expression and role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a proteolytic enzyme suggested to regulate angiogenesis, in a mouse model of inflammation-related corneal neovascularization. A silk suture was placed centrally in pigmented mice corneas causing limbal vasculature to sprout, forming new vessels. Neovascularization progressed centrally involving the entire cornea after about 12 days. Histological analysis revealed vascularization of the corneal stroma accompanied by a marked inflammatory response. The neovascularization correlated with an increased expression of MMP-2 mRNA and protein that was mainly found in cells that stained positively for S100A4, a marker for activated keratocytes. MMP-2-deficient mice and wild-type mice were compared in a kinetic study, showing a statistically significant delay of neovascularization in MMP-2-deficient mice.

In turn, local factors may induce changes in vascularization and contribute to neuronal vulnerability. Among these factors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is released in adults under pathological conditions and is thought to induce angiogenesis. In order to determine whether changes in brain vasculature are observed in the affected brain regions in parkinsonism, we quantitatively analysed the VEGF-expressing cells and blood vessels in the substantia nigra of monkeys rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection and compared the results with those obtained in control monkeys. Using stereological methods, we observed an increase in the number of VEGF-expressing neurons and an increase of the number of blood vessels and their volume occupying the substantia nigra pars compacta of monkeys rendered parkinsonian by chronic MPTP intoxication. These changes in vascularization may therefore modify the neuronal availability of blood nutrients, blood cells or toxic substances and neuronal susceptibility to parkinsonism.", "journal": "Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "date": "2005-01-25", "authors": ["CBarcia", "VBautista", "AS\u00e1nchez-Bahillo", "EFern\u00e1ndez-Villalba", "BFaucheux", "MPoza y Poza", "AFernandez Barreiro", "E CHirsch", "M-THerrero"], "doi": "10.1007/s00702-004-0256-2"}
{"title": "Androgens repress the expression of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 in normal and neoplastic prostate.", "abstract": "In order to understand why the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is often, although not always, associated with prostatic tumors, we have investigated its relationship with the testosterone and the vasculature on which both normal and tumorigenic prostatic epithelia depend. In vivo, androgen withdrawal led to increased TSP1 production and decreased vascularization in the normal rat prostate which was reversed by androgen replacement. Androgen repression of TSP1 production occurred at the transcriptional level and was dependent on the presence of the first intron of the TSP1 gene. In an experimental model of prostate tumorigenesis, TSP1, when delivered by admixed stromal fibroblasts, markedly delayed LNCaP tumor growth and limited tumor vascularization. However, prolonged exposure to TSP1 resulted in the growth of tumors secreting high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in the bloodstream of tumor-bearing animals and tumor growth was no longer sensitive to TSP1 inhibitory effects. Clinical evidence also suggested that prostate carcinomas are able to adapt to escape the antiangiogenic effects of TSP1. In human androgen-dependent localized prostate carcinomas, TSP1 expression was inversely correlated with blood vessel density. Androgen deprivation in patients with hormone-responsive tumors led to increased TSP1 expression and vascular regression. In contrast, despite a sustained expression in the tumor bed, TSP1 was no longer associated with decreased vascularization in hormone-refractory prostate tumors. Overall, these results suggest that the high in situ TSP1 exposure triggered by androgen deprivation in patients with prostate cancer could lead to early tumor resistance. Such patients could benefit from a combination of androgen deprivation and antiangiogenic therapy in order to minimize the induction of such tumor escape.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2005-01-25", "authors": ["MarcColombel", "St\u00e9phanieFilleur", "PierickFournier", "CaroleMerle", "JulienGuglielmi", "Aur\u00e9lieCourtin", "ArmelleDegeorges", "Claire MarieSerre", "RaymondeBouvier", "PhilippeCl\u00e9zardin", "FlorenceCabon"], "doi": null}

However, current rodent models are limited by high costs, long experimental duration, variability, restricted accessibility to the tumor, and major ethical concerns. To avoid these shortcomings, we investigated whether tumor growth on the chick chorio-allantoic membrane after human glioblastoma cell grafting would replicate characteristics of the human disease. Avascular tumors consistently formed within 2 days, then progressed through vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-dependent angiogenesis, associated with hemorrhage, necrosis, and peritumoral edema. Blocking of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling pathways by using small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogated tumor development. Gene regulation during the angiogenic switch was analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays. Defined sample selection for gene profiling permitted identification of regulated genes whose functions are associated mainly with tumor vascularization and growth. Furthermore, expression of known tumor progression genes identified in the screen (IL-6 and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61) as well as potential regulators (lumican and F-box-only 6) follow similar patterns in patient glioma.

We studied the role of the novel T cell costimulatory pathway, CD27-CD70, in alloimmunity in the presence and absence of CD28-B7 signaling. CD70 blockade prolonged survival of fully mismatched vascularized cardiac allografts in wild-type murine recipients, and in CD28-deficient mice induced long-term survival while significantly preventing the development of chronic allograft vasculopathy. CD70 blockade had little effect on CD4(+) T cell function but prevented CD8(+) T cell-mediated rejection, inhibited the proliferation and activation of effector CD8(+) T cells, and diminished the expansion of effector and memory CD8(+) T cells in vivo. Thus, the CD27-CD70 pathway is critical for CD28-independent effector/memory CD8(+) alloreactive T cell activation in vivo.

Younger women under oral contraceptives (OC) can suffer from similar symptoms. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of local estrogens on RUTI and the impact of local hormonal supplementation on bladder neck vascularization.\n30 women (mean age 22.7 years) with a longstanding history of RUTI were included. Pre-treatment investigation included complete clinical history, urinalysis, urine culture and cystoscopy. All subjects completed a questionnaire about onset and duration of disease and quality of life before and after treatment. Local (vaginal) estrogen therapy consisted of 1mg estriol (E3) 7 times a week for two weeks and twice a week for two additional weeks. Sonographic examination of bladder vascularization was performed before and after treatment using transperineal color Doppler ultrasound (6 MHz, Acuson Sequoia 512, Mountain View, CA, USA) with a filled bladder. After angle correction, peak systolic blood flow velocity (PSBFV) and end diastolic blood flow velocity (EDBFV) were measured in 2 bladder arteries; and the Resistive Index (RI) was calculated. Flow velocity in each vessel was measured at least four times and the mean value determined.\nAll patients completed the therapy course without severe side effects. Patients had a mean history of RUTI over 2.3 years; the mean period under OC was 3.2 years. In the follow-up period of 11 months after treatment, 24/30 patients reported no symptoms of cystitis and used no additional medication. Normal bladder epithelium in control cystoscopy after E3 therapy was seen in all patients with trigonal metaplasia and vulnerable, highly vascularized urothelium at the initial investigation. RI decreased from 0.945 to 0.705 after treatment (p<0.001), concomitantly the mean EDBFV increased highly significantly from 0.82 cm/sec to 4.45 cm/sec after estrogen treatment (p<0.001).\nIn a majority of young patients under OC and a longstanding history of RUTI, a considerable infection-free period was achieved after local application of estrogen. Decreased RI and increased EDBFV indicate vasodilatation and less peripheral vascular resistance.

{"title": "Anatomical bases of the bypass-flap: study of the thoracodorsal axis.", "abstract": "Cutaneous tissue loss in patients with lesions on the arterial axes remains difficult to treat. Currently, combined surgery associating distal bypass and free flap seems to be the technique that yields the best results. The hemodynamic advantages of this technique, recently demonstrated, are the distal resistance and the increase in bypass flow. Nevertheless, it is complex and its indications limited. Two major drawbacks can be noted: The increasing risk of thrombosis due to the multiplication of anastomoses on the same arterial axis and the deterioration in venous autograft. To overcome these inconveniences we propose a new technique that we call bypass-flap (BF): the graft of an anatomical entity comprised of one artery and one flap. This graft secures the cover of tissue loss and the revascularization of the limb. Apart from its combined nature this technique presents three major advantages. The arterial autograft is superior to the venous graft, the gradually decreasing diameter of the artery secures the congruence of the anastaomoses, and the arterial flow of the graft is higher than a simple bypass due to the joint vascularization of the flap. The arterial graft includes the subscapular and the thoracodorsal arteries. The free flap is composed of serratus anterior muscle supplied by branches of the graft. This investigation studied the feasibility of the bypass flap and determined the length and diameter of the arterial graft and its muscular branch. Forty anatomical preparations were performed on 20 cadavers. The dissections were performed after injection of Rhodorsil. The anatomical feasibility of the bypass flap was confirmed in 37 cases. The total length of the arterial graft that preserved an external diameter above 2 mm was measured at 13 cm (8.5-15.5). This includes the subscapular artery and the thoracodorsal artery with its intramuscular part (if external diameter of that part always above 2 mm).

{"title": "HIF-2alpha expression in human fetal paraganglia and neuroblastoma: relation to sympathetic differentiation, glucose deficiency, and hypoxia.", "abstract": "Solid tumors are frequently necrotic and hypoxic due to poor vascularization. Tumor cells adapt to hypoxia by modulating their phenotype. Key players in this process are the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1alpha to 3alpha). HIFs are also expressed during normal development; for example, HIF-2alpha is specifically expressed and appears to be involved in the development of the murine sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Here, we demonstrate that HIF-2alpha protein is selectively present in human fetal week 8.5 SNS paraganglia. Neuroblastoma is derived from SNS precursors. In a subset of neuroblastomas, a spontaneous neuronal to neuroendocrine differentiation occurs in areas adjacent to necrotic zones. As HIF-2alpha activity has been associated not only with hypoxic but also with hypoglycemic conditions, we have investigated putative effects of hypoxia, glucose depletion, and HIF-2alpha on the neuroblastoma phenotype. HIF-2alpha was detected in hypoxic and in well-oxygenized neuroblastoma cells and tissue, presumably reflecting their embryonic features. With regard to differentiation, hypoxic cells lost their neuronal/neuroendocrine features and gained marker gene expression associated with an immature, neural crest-like phenotype. Low glucose potentiated the effect of hypoxia.

The muscle has been used as a microvascular flap or a pedicled transfer and has been transferred in combination with other muscles, bones, and skin. We performed 15 dissections of adult axilla regions that were examined under x3.5 loupe magnification to collect anatomic data regarding the neurovascular pedicle of the serratus anterior muscle.

The lateral thoracic artery was noted to supply the upper four slips but it extended into the lower serratus anterior muscle in two cases. Seven branching patterns were found in the lower serratus anterior muscle. In type I, the only branch of serrati proceeded over the long thoracic nerve. Type II had the only branch of serrati proceeding under the long thoracic nerve. In type III, double branches of serrati proceeded over the long thoracic nerve; while in type IV branches of serrati ran with a double branch under the long thoracic nerve.

{"title": "Morphogenesis of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery with three-dimensional reconstruction of the late embryonic vertebrobasilar system.", "abstract": "The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) shows the most variable course among the cerebellar arteries, mainly at the level of the lateral medullary segment. Based on the correlation between the level of origin and the characteristics of the lateromedullary segment, we have proposed three patterns of course of the PICA. With the aim of understanding their embryological basis we review the interrelations between the developing cerebellum and the primitive hindbrain arterial plexus through the analysis of transverse serial sections of human embryos of 22.5 and 23 mm crown-rump length. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the vertebrobasilar system has been performed to study the morphology of the vascular networks. The cerebellar primordium is vascularized by the metencephalic plexus that will form the basilar artery and the superior cerebellar arteries. Due to the development of the pontine flexure the rhomboid lips approach and the cerebellum comes into contact with the myelencephalon; thus the myelencephalic plexus represents an acquired source of vascularization for the cerebellum with respect to the metencephalic plexus. The examination of the transverse sections shows that the vertebral and basilar arteries, superior cerebellar arteries, anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, and primitive lateral vertebrobasilar anastomoses are well recognizable. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the vessels shows that the PICA is not yet defined due to the persistence of a plexus of many thin vessels at the level of the lateral aspect of the myelencephalon, indicating that its origin and course are established at the end of the embryonic period. Based on the evolution of the primitive hindbrain plexus, we suggest that in synchrony with the progressive descent of the cerebellum the branches of the myelencephalic plexus succeed with a rostrocaudal progression in feeding the cerebellum and the morphogenesis of the PICA results from the selection of portions of this plexus. The high origin of the PICA from the basilar artery could be ascribed to its development from a rostral collateral of the plexus due to an early development of the vessel at the beginning of its embryonic lifetime. Moreover, the three patterns of course of the PICA could reflect the variable retention of the primitive lateral vertebrobasilar anastomosis in the trunk of the definitive PICA, which may be related to its level of origin.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2005-01-13", "authors": ["VMacchi", "APorzionato", "DGuidolin", "AParenti", "RDe Caro"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-004-0303-6"}

IHC also showed a marked staining for the enzyme around blood vessels and in vascularized regions. Our results provide evidence demonstrating that HPSE-1 likely plays important roles in regulating the in vivo growth and progression of melanoma. These results further emphasize the importance that therapies designed to block HPSE-1 activity may aid in controlling this type of cancer.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "2005-01-13", "authors": ["Brian PMurry", "AndreaGreiter-Wilke", "Daniel PPaulsen", "Kim MHiatt", "Carlo AlbertoBeltrami", "DarioMarchetti"], "doi": null}

In this study, a concept combining surgical and prosthodontic treatments for mandibular fibula free flap reconstruction after tumor surgery was made based on a classification of bone defects. A follow-up study was performed to evaluate the treatment concept for oral rehabilitation in order to identify possible factors which may influence the functional result.\nA follow-up examination included 28 patients who underwent the ablative tumor surgery and mandibular reconstruction during a 4-year period. The follow-up protocol included clinical examination, radiological evaluation, and an interview using a standardized questionnaire. The timing of the study was set to allow for a minimum 2-year follow-up (mean 45 months).\nAt the time of examination, prosthesis-based oral rehabilitation was completed in six patients (21%), and the prosthodontic work was still unfinished in four other patients. The other 18 had no dental prosthetic rehabilitation. Thirteen patients received a total of 37 oral implants, and 23 implants were functionally loaded. No implant loss was recorded. Oral functions such as speech, diet tolerance and oral competence were not directly affected by the presence of dentures. A decisive factor affecting the oral function was the extent of soft-tissue loss. According to the classification described here, the extent of the mandibular defect did not correlate with oral functions.

Treatment of complex deformities may require preplanned major angulation provided by adjustable devices. We sought to assess the effects of molding the fresh regenerate on vascularization and early bone formation within clinically relevant dimensions.\nEvaluation of the nature of the problem in mechanical terms was based on a geometrical model, its dimensions chosen with clinical relevance. Custom-made devices, allowing the simultaneous compression and stretching of a regenerate 10 mm long, were fixed bilaterally in the angular region of beagle mandibles (n = 14). Angulation of 20 degrees (n = 7) or 30 degrees (n = 7) was performed immediately after ending the lengthening period, and the animals were killed after a 7-day consolidation period. The vascular system was stained via intravital Procion red infusion and post mortem carbon ink (Deperussol P130; Degussa AG, Frankfurt, Germany) perfusion to assess possible damages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the mineralized tissue were performed with contact radiography, quantified computed tomography, and histologic assessment.\nThe only finding indicating mechanical forces acting on the regenerate was related to orientation of the collagenous fibers. Vascular damage was not observed. Mineralization patterns were identical in both the compressed and the stretched zone. The degree of angulation had no visible impact on early bone formation, even if compression and stretching of the regenerate at a range of 33% to 54% exceeds most clinical requirements. However, the amount of callus formation differed independent of the shaping angle, revealing parameters other than the degree of angulation to be important.\nAlthough the newly forming bone is highly sensitive to nonphysiologic strain during the lengthening process, a completed fresh regenerate, created by distraction osteogenesis, can be manipulated to a considerable extent without endangering early callus formation. Manipulation of the regenerates would provide a precise final result, minimizing the need for secondary corrections and diminishing treatment duration and costs.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2005-01-07", "authors": ["ChristophKunz", "NikolaiAdolphs", "PhilippeBuescher", "BeatHammer", "BertonRahn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2004.07.008"}

It is predominantly expressed in tendons, ligaments, and eyes, whereas the only other family member, chondromodulin I (ChM-I), is highly expressed in cartilage and at lower levels in the eye and thymus. The C-terminal extracellular domains of both proteins were shown to modulate endothelial-cell proliferation and tube formation in vitro and in vivo. We analyzed Tnmd function in vivo and provide evidence that Tnmd is processed in vivo and that the proteolytically cleaved C-terminal domain can be found in tendon extracts. Loss of Tnmd expression in gene targeted mice abated tenocyte proliferation and led to a reduced tenocyte density. The deposited amounts of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen types I, II, III, and VI and decorin, lumican, aggrecan, and matrilin-2, were not affected, but the calibers of collagen fibrils varied significantly and exhibited increased maximal diameters. Tnmd-deficient mice did not have changes in tendon vessel density, and mice lacking both Tnmd and ChM-I had normal retinal vascularization and neovascularization after oxygen-induced retinopathy.

By epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the subepicardium and epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) are formed. EPDCs migrate into the myocardium, where they differentiate into smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts that stabilize the developing coronary vasculature and contribute to myocardial architecture. Complete PEO ablation results in embryonic lethality due to cardiac defects, including a looping disorder with a too wide inner curvature. To investigate the behavior of early coronary contributors, we analyzed normal quail embryos and found lumenized endothelial vessels in the subepicardium already at stage HH19. Furthermore, EPCs had penetrated into the myocardium of the inner curvature. To confirm that the myocardium of the inner curvature is specifically permissive for EPCs and to study early EPDC migration in more detail, chimeric chicken embryos harboring a quail PEO were analyzed. Lateral epicardial outgrowth and EMT were observed throughout, but migration into the myocardium was restricted to the inner curvature between HH19 and 22. The permissive myocardial area expanded to the atrium, atrioventricular canal, and trabeculated ventricle at stage HH23-24. In contrast, outflow tract myocardium was never found to be permissive for EPDCs and EPCs until HH30, not even when the quail PEO was attached directly onto it. We conclude that early coronary formation starts in the inner curvature and hypothesize that the presence of PEO-derived cells is essential for the maturation of the inner curvature and subsequent looping of the heart tube.", "journal": "The anatomical record.

The angiogenic induction capacity of these fragments was also tested in a mouse and rat model of limb ischemia. We report that such fragments, when implanted in the vicinity of the ischaemic area, induce an angiogenic response which can rescue the ischaemia-induced damage.

For this reason, the effects of stenosing laryngeal pathologies on the vital factor respiratory gas exchange are particularly critical.Internal stabilization is a prerequisite for recovery of the laryngeal respiratory function in severe forms of inspiratory collapse (laryngomalacia). Effective laser surgery techniques have been developed to this end in recent years.Glottis-dilating surgery in cases of bilateral vocal cord motion impairment is now moving in the direction of endoscopic laser cordotomy or cordectomy, whereas arytenoidectomy and open surgical procedures are now used only rarely due to higher secondary morbidity rates. In individual cases, in particular if functional recovery is expected, temporary laterofixation of a vocal cord using an endoscopic suturing technique can be a helpful approach.Extensive laryngeal defects can be covered by means of composite grafts with mucosal lining, a supporting skeleton and their own vascularization. Autologous transplantation of the larynx, with its complex surgical and immunological problems, has become a manageable procedure. The problems of post-transplantation reinnervation and risk assessment of immunosuppression-induced recurrence of the tumor are still under consideration.Reanimation of the bilaterally paralyzed larynx by means of neurorrhaphy (neurosuture), neural grafting and, more recently, functional electrostimulation (pacemaker) represents a challenge for the coming years. In most cases of paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, a part of the muscles is maintained by synkinetic reinnervation when therapy is carried out, which however also prevents effective vocal cord movement due to simultaneous activity of agonists and antagonists.

However, the mechanism by which CXCL12/CXCR4 functions in blood vessel formation remains elusive. Here, we have found a novel mode of organ vascularization and determined the roles of CXCL12 in these processes. In the developing small intestine, many short interconnecting vessels form between larger superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the neighboring primary capillary plexus surrounding the primitive gut, and they elongate and become the arteries supplying the small intestine. Mice lacking CXCL12 or CXCR4 lack the interconnecting vessels but have normal venous networks. The mutants lack filopodial extension and intussusception from endothelial cells of SMAs seen in wild-type embryos. CXCR4 is specifically expressed in arteries in the developing mesenteries and its expression is severely reduced in CXCL12-/- embryos. Mice in which CXCR4 is specifically deleted in the endothelium reveal vascular defects identical to those observed in the conventional CXCR4-/- embryos.

{"title": "Variability of the division of the cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery.", "abstract": "This article presents a method of analysis of variation in the cortical branching of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The method takes account of previous observations and reflects various symptoms of such variation. Of 100 cerebral hemispheres into whose vessels a contrast medium was injected, 94 hemispheres have been qualified for further examination. In six hemispheres, there were anomalies of the PCA, which are not included in the present analysis of division. A general model of the division of the artery has been developed. On the basis of this model, principles of the analysis of the variation have been discussed. The model comprises of three elements. The first is the main trunk. The second is intermediate trunks. The third element may appear in two forms: proper cortical arteries and cortical arterial groups. The main trunk was defined as the vessels arising from the final division of the basilar artery with its end in the place of branching of the most peripheral proper cortical artery, that is, parieto-occipital artery. Intermediate trunks are these parts of the PCA that extend between the main trunk and proper cortical arteries or cortical arterial groups. The identification criterion for the intermediate trunks is its length, which is to be equal to or exceed the sum of the radius of the two vessels, which the intermediate trunk gives off. There have been distinguished primary and secondary intermediate trunks. Proper cortical arteries or cortical arterial groups are parts of the PCA by means of which blood is supplied directly to the cortex. Cortical branches of the PCA of a relatively constant topography and vascularization were termed proper cortical arteries. In some cases, cortical branches are accompanied by small vessels of varying number and size. They were named accessory cortical arteries. Proper cortical arteries together with accompanying accessory cortical arteries have been named cortical arterial groups. The number of the proper cortical arteries is considered to be constant and is six. The theory of combinations has been applied to establish all possible branching variants. There are 16 such variants. Eleven of them (68%) were represented in the analyzed material. In seven hemispheres (7.4%), intermediate trunks were not observed. In 87 hemispheres (92.6%), there were present primary intermediate trunks. In four hemispheres (4.2%), there were found primary and secondary intermediate trunks.

Arteriography showed stenosis of the celiac artery and a saccular aneurysm, arising from the first jejunal artery. We made a preoperative diagnosis of intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head and performed a laparotomy. Transection of the median arcuate ligament failed to restore adequate hepatic blood flow, necessitating construction of celiac vascularization, achieved by a gastroduodenal to jejunal artery anastomosis. After ligation of the jejunal artery aneurysm, we performed a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Microscopically, the tumor had papillary intracystic growth, and was lined by plump cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, consistent with a diagnosis of intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm. We discuss this recently recognized entity of papillary neoplasm of the pancreas, and the importance of managing hepatic blood flow during pancreaticoduodenectomy in celiac artery compression syndrome.", "journal": "Surgery today", "date": "2004-12-29", "authors": ["YasuoShima", "TakahitoYagi", "MasaruInagaki", "HiroshiSadamori", "NoriakiTanaka", "TadashiHorimi", "ShujiHamazaki"], "doi": "10.1007/s00595-004-2864-8"}

Retrograde dye injection showed that the lesser saphenous vein in rabbits has many valves with strong resistance against reflux. Twenty rabbits were randomly allocated into four groups of 10 flaps each. Group I consisted of proximally based flaps with the lesser saphenous vein intact (outflow) in the veno-neuro-adipofascial pedicle. Group II also consisted of proximally based flaps but the lesser saphenous vein was ligated at 1 cm proximal to the pedicle. Group III consisted of distally based flaps with the lesser saphenous vein intact (inflow) in the veno-neuro-adipofascial pedicle. Group IV also consisted of distally based flaps, but the lesser saphenous vein was ligated at 1 cm distal to the pedicle. The results showed that the mean flap survival area in group I (88.8 percent) was statistically higher than that in group II (62.6 percent, p < 0.001), and was higher in group IV (55.5 percent) than in group III (22.7 percent, p < 0.01). However, group II and group IV had no significant difference (p > 0.05). This experiment demonstrated that flap viability is determined by its intrinsic vascularization, both arterial and venous. The large superficial subcutaneous vein has a positive role (venous outflow) in proximally based flaps but a negative role (venous inflow) in distally based flaps. If the effect of the large subcutaneous vein is excluded, distally based flaps are not inherently inferior to proximally based flaps.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-12-29", "authors": ["Shi-MinChang", "Yu-DongGu", "Ji-FengLi"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Axial pattern composite prefabrication of high-density porous polyethylene: experimental and clinical research.", "abstract": "Currently, various alloplastic materials are being used for reconstruction of three-dimensional structures, and high-density porous polyethylene is so far the best and the most commonly used material. Various indications for high-density porous polyethylene have been defined for closure of craniofacial defects, correction of congenital anomalies, and aesthetic augmentations. A common property of various studies published so far is that after being fixed to the bone or underlying structures, high-density porous polyethylene has been covered primarily or by skin flaps. For reconstruction of complex three-dimensional structures such as the ear and nose, the success of current methods is limited by the thinness and pliability of the skin flap. In this study, the authors' aim was to investigate the graftability of high-density porous polyethylene after prefabrication with an axial pedicle and to explore possible clinical applications in light of the new data obtained. In the experimental study, three-dimensional implants (rectangular prism) carved from high-density porous polyethylene were prefabricated using bilateral superficial epigastric arteries and veins of 25 New Zealand rabbits. After a waiting period of 2 to 6 weeks in five groups, control samples were obtained and the prefabricated implants that had been left in place were directly grafted. The results showed that high-density porous polyethylene was vascularized 75 percent after 4 weeks and 90 percent after 5 weeks, and 95 percent of the grafts had survived after 8 weeks. In the clinical study, three nose defects, three ear defects, and one hard palate defect in seven patients ranging in age from 21 to 72 years were reconstructed using the same method. High-density porous polyethylene has been prefabricated and directly grafted for the very first time on a clinical basis. No serious complications have been observed, except for minimal graft loss in two patients. It is obvious that full-thickness skin grafts that are thinner than flaps will adapt better to the fine details of high-density porous polyethylene and will highly increase the detail obtained in the reconstruction of three-dimensional defects.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-12-29", "authors": ["RagipOzdemir", "UgurKocer", "Yigit OzerTiftikcioglu", "OnderKaraaslan", "YukselKankaya", "SedatCuzdan", "Dilek ErtoyBaydar"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Microvascular omental transfer for the treatment of severe recurrent median neuritis of the wrist: a long-term follow-up.", "abstract": "The results of reoperation for recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome have been quite disappointing. In addition to a secondary external or internal neurolysis, multiple tissues and procedures have been used to decrease scar adherence of the reoperated median nerve including muscle, fascial or fat flaps, and vein wrapping. However, each technique has certain limitations, especially in the carpal tunnel that has previously undergone multiple operations, with diffuse scar and adherence over an extended length of the median nerve. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term functional and symptomatic outcome following microvascular omental transfer for severe recalcitrant median neuritis. Between 1989 and 1993, 10 extremities in seven patients underwent omental transfer for severe recurrent median neuritis at the wrist. Nine extremities in six women were available for personal evaluation at an average follow-up of 6.6 years (range, 4.5 to 8.75 years). All extremities had undergone a minimum of two previous surgical procedures, and since 1991, all patients also failed local pedicle tissue coverage. Each patient completed a physical examination, a questionnaire, and electrophysiologic studies. At surgery, all median nerves were encased in dense adherent scar, which often extended proximal to the wrist crease. There were seven neural abnormalities in six extremities, three patent median arteries, and one aberrant palmaris longus muscle. The Functional Status Index was 3.1 +/- 0.7 and the Symptom Severity Index was 3.1 +/- 0.9, with a range of 1 (best) to 5. Most symptoms were improved but not completely alleviated. Four of nine extremities exhibited improved two-point discrimination and five of seven improved sensitivity, according to the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Grip strength increased an average of 73 percent in seven of nine extremities and pinch strength increased 101 percent in four of nine extremities. Five of six patients were satisfied with their results and reported improved quality of life. Preoperatively, five of seven patients were working on light duty; postoperatively, three of six patients attempted to return to work, but none were working at final follow-up. Electrophysiologic data did not correlate with the symptomatic or functional outcome. There were four complications; three were related to delayed wound healing, and one morbidly obese patient developed a ventral hernia. Wrapping the median nerve with vascularized omentum is a viable option for the treatment of severe recalcitrant carpal tunnel syndrome. Despite a high satisfaction rate and significant symptomatic improvement, many symptoms will persist, but to a lesser degree.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-12-29", "authors": ["Robert JGoitz", "James BSteichen"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Flow-through anterior thigh flaps with a short pedicle for reconstruction of lower leg and foot defects.", "abstract": "New flow-through perforator flaps with a large, short vascular pedicle are proposed because of their clinical significance and a high success rate for reconstruction of the lower legs. Of 13 consecutive cases, the authors describe two cases of successful transfer of a new short-pedicle anterolateral or anteromedial thigh flow-through flap for coverage of soft-tissue defects in the legs. This new flap has a thin fatty layer and a small fascial component, and is vascularized with a perforator originating from a short segment of the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral system. The advantages of this flap are as follows: flow-through anastomosis ensures a high success rate for free flaps and preserves the recipient arterial flow; there is no need for dissecting throughout the lateral circumflex femoral system as the pedicle vessel; minimal time is required for flap elevation; there is minimal donor-site morbidity; and the flap is obtained from a thin portion of the thigh. Even in obese patients, thinning of the flap with primary defatting is possible, and the donor scar is concealed. This flap is suitable for coverage of defects in legs where a single arterial flow remains.

All wounds were open for a minimum period of 6 weeks (average, 24.7 months; range, 6 weeks to 52 months). The average patient age was 42.8 years (range, 18 to 71 years), there were 21 male and seven female patients, and the average follow-up period was 18.2 months (range, 5 to 41 months). The cause of injury was an open fracture in 10 cases, secondary wound complications after reduction in eight cases, and diabetic foot in 10 cases. The surface defects ranged from 50 to 153 cm. The wounds were debrided an average of 2.5 times and then reconstructed with flap and treated with antibiotics for 6 weeks. Antibiotic beads were used in six cases and secondary bone graft procedures were performed in seven cases 3 months after the flap coverage. All 28 flaps were successful without any signs of recurrences or persistent osteomyelitis, but partial wound dehiscence was observed during early rehabilitation in two cases suspected of delayed healing caused by diabetes. These wounds healed spontaneously. All patients achieved acceptable gait function after rehabilitation. No debulking procedure was necessary in any case. Although the muscle flap is known to provide superior vascular supply, the type of flap used for coverage seems to be less critical in the final outcome, provided that total debridement and obliteration of dead spaces are achieved. A well-vascularized anterolateral thigh perforator flap was successfully used to combat infection and bring stability to wounds with chronic osteomyelitis.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2004-12-29", "authors": ["Joon PioHong", "Hyun WooShin", "Jung JaeKim", "Fu-ChanWei", "Yoon KyuChung"], "doi": null}

Although it improves the survival rate in cancer patients, it may cause osteoradionecrosis, especially in the mandible and maxilla. Twelve patients with osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla were treated with microsurgical free tissue transplantations between April of 1996 and August of 2002. There were 10 male and two female patients, with a mean age of 60.2 years. The mean radiotherapy dose was 6674 cGy. The radiation dose could not be traced in three patients because radiotherapy was performed elsewhere. Radical sequestrectomy, soft-tissue debridement, and pathologic proof of no tumor recurrence were performed before microsurgical reconstruction. Free flaps used included the following: anterolateral thigh (n = 7), radial forearm (n = 2), rectus femoris musculocutaneous (n = 2), and supracondylar chimeric (n = 1) flaps. All flaps survived completely and reconstruction succeeded. During a mean 25-month follow-up period, ectropion, plate exposure, and mild infection were encountered in three patients and treated successfully.

The goal of this study was to determine whether the 3-D porous character of the PES surface affected human endothelial cell morphology and functions. Freshly isolated human endothelial cells from the skin (HDMEC), from the lung (HPMEC) and from umbilical cords (HUVEC) and two human endothelial cell lines, HPMEC-ST1.6R and ISO-HAS.c1 were added to PES fibers and cell adherence and growth was followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Prior coating of PES with gelatin or fibronectin was necessary for adhesion and spreading of cells over the uneven porous surface with time. Confluent cells exhibited typical strong PECAM-1 expression at cell-cell borders. Little expression of the activation markers E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 was observed by RT-PCR of endothelial cells growing on PES. However, after stimulation for 4h by LPS, activation of these markers was observed and it was shown by immunofluorescent staining that induction occurred in most of the cells, thus confirming an intact functionality. Finally, cells growing as a monolayer on PES migrated to form microvessel-like structures when placed under conditions that stimulated angiogenesis. Thus, human endothelial cells grown on fibronectin-coated PES fibers retain important endothelial-cell specific morphological and functional properties and PES may serve as a useful biomaterial in tissue engineering and biotechnology applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2004-12-29", "authors": ["Ronald EUnger", "KirstenPeters", "QuanHuang", "AndreasFunk", "DieterPaul", "C JKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.09.047"}

{"title": "Liver tissue engineering at extrahepatic sites in mice as a potential new therapy for genetic liver diseases.", "abstract": "Liver tissue engineering using hepatocyte transplantation has been proposed as an alternative to whole-organ transplantation or liver-directed gene therapy to correct various types of hepatic insufficiency. Hepatocytes are not sustained when transplanted under the kidney capsule of syngeneic mice. However, when we transplanted hepatocytes with the extracellular matrix components extracted from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm cells, hepatocytes survived for at least 140 days and formed small liver tissues. Liver engineering in hemophilia A mice reconstituted 5% to 10% of normal clotting activity, enough to reduce the bleeding time and have a therapeutic benefit. Conversely, the subcutaneous space did not support the persistent survival of hepatocytes with Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm gel matrix. We hypothesized that establishing a local vascular network at the transplantation site would reduce graft loss. To test this idea, we provided a potent angiogenic agent before hepatocyte transplantation into the subcutaneous space. With this procedure, persistent survival was achieved for the length of the experiment (120 days). To establish that these engineered liver tissues also retained their native regeneration potential in vivo, we induced two different modes of proliferative stimulus to the naive liver and confirmed that hepatocytes within the extrahepatic tissues regenerated with activity similar to that of naive liver. In conclusion, our studies indicate that liver tissues can be engineered and maintained at extrahepatic sites, retain their capacity for regeneration in vivo, and used to successfully treat genetic disorders.", "journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "date": "2004-12-25", "authors": ["KazuoOhashi", "Jacob MWaugh", "Michael DDake", "TakashiYokoyama", "HiroyukiKuge", "YoshiyukiNakajima", "MasakiYamanouchi", "HiroyukiNaka", "AkiraYoshioka", "Mark AKay"], "doi": "10.1002/hep.20484"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis--a self-adapting principle in hypoxia.", "abstract": "Normal tissue function depends on adequate supply of oxygen through blood vessels. Reduced oxygen supply (hypoxia) induces a variety of specific adaptation mechanisms in mammals that occur at the cellular, local and systemic level. These mechanisms are in part governed by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2. Prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases as recently characterized oxygen sensors allow the regulation of HIFs that in turn modulate expression of hypoxically regulated genes such as VEGF. VEGF plays a key role in the formation of a functional and integrated vascular network required during physiological processes such as embryogenesis or female reproductive cycle as well as during a variety of pathological processes such tumor growth, wound healing, retinopathy and ischemic diseases (myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemia). However, other angiogenic factors, such as angiopoietins, PDGF, ephrins and erythropoietin are additionally needed to enable the formation of a functional vascular network. Many of these factors are activated during hypoxia although no HIF binding sites have yet been identified in the regulatory sequences of theses genes. Hypoxia-induced gene products that result in new vessel growth may be part of a self-regulated physiological protection mechanism preventing cell injury, especially under conditions of chronically reduced blood blow (chronic ischemia).", "journal": "EXS", "date": "2004-12-25", "authors": ["Hugo HMarti"], "doi": "10.1007/3-7643-7311-3_12"}

Hypoxia-related factors carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) were visualized by immunohistochemistry, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA by in situ hybridization. Expression patterns of VEGF and CA9 are similar with regard to distribution (perinecrotic) and extent. HIF-1alpha expression occurs in a significantly smaller fraction of cases and only in a few tumor cells without clear association with necrosis. Expression of VEGF and CA9, but not HIF-1alpha, is associated with a bizarre angiogenic subtype. Combined expression of two or three hypoxia markers (high hypoxia score) associates with presence of necrosis, high proliferation index, bizarre vascular pattern, and increased cellularity. Univariate analysis indicated that patients with high hypoxia score had significantly shorter survival. On multivariate analysis, only proliferation index and extent of resection remained independent predictive factors.

Fifteen SHRs were treated for 40 days with simvastatin, pravastatin or placebo (water) via orogastric administration. Left ventricle and renal cortex were examined by light microscopy and stereology. LV (left ventricular) cardiomyocyte nuclei (N[cmn]) and glomeruli (N[gl]) numbers were estimated by the dissector method. BP (blood pressure) and serum triacylglycerols (triglycerides) were lower in the statin-treated groups than in the untreated control group. The volume density of the interstitial connective tissue was smaller and length density of the intramyocardial arteries, as well as the arteries/cardiomyocyte ratio, was greater in the statin-treated groups than in the control group. No difference was observed between the two statin-treated groups. The cross-sectional cardiomyocyte area was significantly smaller in the simvastatin-treated group than in the control or pravastatin-treated groups, and it was smaller in the pravastatin-treated group than in the control group. N[cmn] and N[gl] were greater in the two statin-treated groups than in the control group, but no significant difference was observed between the two statin-treated groups.

One possible clinical application of TP508 is to accelerate bone regeneration during distraction osteogenesis, which is a lengthy procedure involving significant complications. In this study, we tested the ability of TP508 to accelerate the consolidation phase of distraction osteogenesis in a rabbit model of leg lengthening. Twenty-three rabbits had left tibiae lengthened for 1 cm over a period of 6 days. TP 508 (0, 30 and 300 microg in 300 microl saline) was injected into the distraction gaps at the beginning and the end of the lengthening phase, and all the animals were killed 2 weeks after lengthening. By the end of experiment, more animals in the TP508 treated groups had complete bony union of the distraction gaps when compared to the saline treated group. pQCT examination of the regenerates demonstrated a significantly greater bone mineral density (BMD) in the TP508 treated groups relative to the saline control group, but no statistical difference in the BMD was found between the two dosages of TP508. Bone consolidation and bone remodeling was far advanced in the TP508 300 microg treated group, and the regenerates mainly consisted of well-vascularized woven bone.

One month later, histomorphometric analysis evidenced the presence of a fibrous-reactive capsule around all specimens showing significant differences among groups (p<0.0005). The highest thickness of the fibrous capsule was found around the freeze-dried bone implants (p<0.05); as well as the Hyal-50%-Cu2+ plus freeze-dried bone (15.2%, p<0.05) and Hyal 50% plus freeze-dried bone (21.4%, p<0.0005) implants showed a significant higher thickness compared with Hyal 50% and Hyal-50%-Cu2+. Statistical analysis showed a significant (p<0.01) higher vascular density in Hyal- 50%-Cu2+ and Hyal-50%-Cu2+ plus freeze-dried bone group when compared to other groups. The present preliminary results suggest the advantages offered by the combined use of a well-known biocompatible and tissue healing promoting material (Hyal-50%) and a new technique that consists of stimulating tissue vascularization using Cu2+ and that bone allograft incorporation may benefit from this technology.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2004-12-18", "authors": ["GGiavaresi", "PTorricelli", "P MFornasari", "RGiardino", "RBarbucci", "GLeone"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.08.027"}

A total of 97 invasive breast carcinomas were prospectively studied with unenhanced power Doppler sonography before surgery. Lumpectomy or mastectomy with full axillary nodal dissection was performed. Sonographic tumor size and number of tumor arteries were correlated with axillary nodal status by means of logistic regression analysis. Tumor microvascularization was immunohistochemically assessed in a subset of 55 carcinomas. Sonographic variables were correlated with tumor arteries with a diameter larger than 300 mum and with the density and area of microvascularization. The kappa statistic and Bland-Altman agreement limits were used to measure agreement between techniques.\nGood agreement of sonographic and histologic findings regarding number of tumor arteries (kappa= 0.66, P < .001) and tumor size (P = .012) was observed. Multivariate analysis showed an independent relationship between probability of axillary metastasis, number of tumor arteries (P = .016), and sonographic tumor size (P = .035). A predictive model of axillary status was developed. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine 0.2324 as the score to classify axillary nodal status. This score indicated high sensitivity (96.1%), low specificity (53.0%), and high negative predictive value (96.1%).\nThe number of arteries in invasive breast carcinoma detected with unenhanced power Doppler sonography and sonographic tumor size are independent predictors of axillary nodal status; these variables could contribute to reliable prediction of absence of axillary involvement on the basis of a mathematic model.", "journal": "Radiology", "date": "2004-12-17", "authors": ["GoraneSantamar\u00eda", "Mart\u00ednVelasco", "XavierFarr\u00e9", "Juan AntonioVanrell", "AntonioCardesa", "Pedro LuisFern\u00e1ndez"], "doi": "10.1148/radiol.2342031252"}

VEGF produced by tumor cells stimulates endothelial cell growth through the binding and activation of the KDR/Flk-1 receptor (VEGFR-2) on endothelial cells. Recently, some human breast cancer epithelial cells have been shown to express VEGF receptors, suggesting a potential autocrine-mediated growth stimulation of a subset of cancers by VEGF. We demonstrate that mammary tumors in the C3(1)/Tag transgenic model express VEGF and VEGF receptors and tumor growth is stimulated by this autocrine mechanism. GW654652, an indazolylpyrimidine, is a VEGFRs tyrosine kinase inhibitor that dramatically reduces both angiogenesis and tumor cell growth in this model, as demonstrated using both in vitro and in vivo assays. GW654652 significantly decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and M6 mammary tumor cells derived from C3(1)/Tag (Tag: simian virus 40 T-antigen) transgenic mice. A 75% reduction in VEGF-induced angiogenesis was observed with GW654652 using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, whereas GW654652 produced an approximately 85% reduction in angiogenesis as assessed by the Matrigel plug assay. A profound inhibitory effect on tumor growth in the C3(1)/Tag transgenic model of human breast cancer was observed with oral administration of GW654652 as measured by delayed tumor onset, decreased multiplicity, reduced tumor volume, and extended animal survival. The antitumor effects of GW654652 were associated with reduced tumor vascularization and no apparent toxicity. Tumor growth, however, rapidly advanced following cessation of treatment. This is the first demonstration that a VEGF receptor inhibitor, GW654652, has a strong inhibitory effect on angiogenesis and tumor progression in a transgenic model of mammary cancer, suggesting that this is a useful approach for preclinical testing of such agents.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2004-12-14", "authors": ["Jung-ImHuh", "AlfonsoCalvo", "JeffreyStafford", "MuiCheung", "RakeshKumar", "DeborahPhilp", "Hynda KKleinman", "Jeffrey EGreen"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1208221"}
{"title": "Anti-tumor effect of hematopoietic cells carrying the gene of ribonuclease inhibitor.", "abstract": "Human ribonuclease inhibitor (hRI) is an acid protein with a molecular weight of 50 kDa. It can inhibit the activity of pancreatic RNase (RNase A). Angiogenin (Ang) is a member of the ribonuclease super family. It has 35% identity with RNase A and contains ribonucleolytic activity. The substrate specificity of angiogenin seems, however, to be more restricted than that of the pancreatic RNase. Since Ang is an important angiogenic factor and RI is a highly efficient inhibitor of Ang, it can be hypothesized that RI may be a latent antiangiogenic drug. This study focuses on the feasibility of transfecting the ri gene into mice hematopoietic cells and inducing the expression of the ri gene to block the angiogenesis of solid tumors. First, the cDNA gene of the ri from human placenta was cloned and inserted in a retroviral vector, pLNCX. The combined vector pLNCX-ri was transfected into retroviral packaging cells, PA317, and a clone producing a high titer of virus was obtained. Next, isolated hematopoietic cells from mice bone marrow were infected with viruses carrying the pLNCX-ri. The infected cells were then injected into lethally irradiated mice. The expression and the contribution of RI were assayed in vivo. After administration of hematopoietic cells carrying the ri gene, mice were implanted with B16 melanomas for 21 days. The results showed that tumors of control groups became large and well vascularized. In contrast, tumors from mice groups treated with hematopoietic cells carrying the ri gene were small and possessed a relatively low density of blood vessels. The inhibited growth rate of the tumors was 47%.

This pathway is active during the formation of a corpus luteum, a highly vascularized, endocrine organ with a short life span during the nonpregnant state. In the pregnant state, the life span of corpora lutea is much longer because they play a critical role in supporting pregnancy development. We hypothesized that the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway plays a critical role in regulating angiogenic events in the corpora lutea of pregnancy. Injection of the neutralizing anti-VEGFR-2 antibody DC101 (ImClone Systems, Inc., New York, NY) on embryonic d 3.5 (preimplantation) or 6.5 (postimplantation) disrupts function of the corpora lutea of pregnancy in CD1 mice, as evidenced by a decrease in organ size, regression of luteal vessels, and a fall in progesterone secretion within 24 h postinjection. Inhibition of the VEGFR-2 caused removal of endothelial cells, mostly through endothelial cell detachment from the vascular basement membrane. Luteal steroid-producing epithelial cells were eliminated through apoptosis secondary to vasculature becoming dysfunctional. Disruption of luteal function caused arrest of embryonic development. The effect of antibody is specific to the ovary, because pregnancy progresses normally in ovariectomized, progesterone-replaced animals treated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. Embryonic blood vessels were not affected directly by the antibody, because it did not reach the embryo. Administration of an antibody against VE-cadherin (E4G10), which specifically blocks endothelial proliferation, did not disrupt luteal function and pregnancy development. Thus, VEGFR-2-mediated endothelial cell signals are critical to maintain functionality of luteal blood vessels during pregnancy.

We have previously demonstrated that GA suppresses the immune rejection manifested in graft versus host disease, as well as in graft rejection. In an attempt to reduce the dosage and toxicity of the current immunosuppressive regimens, we have now tested the ability of GA, combined with low doses of cyclosporin (CyA) or tacrolimus (FK506), to suppress the rejection of mismatched allografts across major histocompatibility barriers. We report herewith that such combination therapy was effective in several animal models: (1) it led to a significant delay of the vigorous process of skin rejection in mice, manifested by evidential prolongation in skin graft survival (higher than that obtained with at least double dose of the immunosuppressive drug alone). (2) The combined treatment led to efficient inhibition of the functional deterioration of thyroid grafts in mice, manifested by 2.2- to 20.1-fold increase in iodine absorbance of the transplanted thyroids, as compared to each drug alone. (3) Combination therapy inhibited significantly the rejection of vascularized heart transplants in rats. Thus, cardiac allograft survival following the combined treatment with GA and low dose of CyA was longer than the survival obtained by fourfold higher dose of CyA alone. In all transplantation systems, combination therapy of GA with either CyA or FK506 significantly suppressed graft rejection and was more effective than treatment with either GA or the immunosuppressive drug alone, suggesting that such treatment may be beneficial for human transplantation.", "journal": "International immunopharmacology", "date": "2004-12-14", "authors": ["RinaAharoni", "AlexanderYussim", "MichaelSela", "RuthArnon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2004.09.007"}

In this study, a 3-year review was undertaken of nine consecutive patients with a myelomeningocele defect treated in our hospital. The aim of the study was to analyze the size, location of myelomeningocele defects, features of the surrounding tissue, and type and results of the reconstruction method for skin closure. Of the nine patients, five were repaired within the first 48 h of life, two within the 1st month of life, and two were repaired within the 1st year of life. Of the nine patients, seven (78%) underwent repair with direct skin approximation by the Neurosurgical Service. For three patients (33%) with large lumbosacral meningomyelocele defects, including one patient who had failed direct skin approximation, the Plastic Surgery Service achieved the skin closure by bilateral paralumbar fasciocutaneous rotational flaps. Minimal area in the patients referred to the Plastic Surgery Service was 24 cm2 (range 24-48 cm2); patients having 18 cm2 or less skin defect were not referred for closure. In conclusion, fasciocutaneous rotational flaps provided tension-free, durable, innervated and well-vascularized skin coverage over the dural repair in all three referred patients, without using skin graft. Since myelomeningocele defects vary in size, shape, and location, no single procedure applies to all.

Compared to areas on the surface of the brain, the anatomical and physiological properties of areas within the fissure are poorly understood.

To enable direct experimental access, a neurosurgical technique was developed in primates whereby the banks of the lateral fissure were retracted with sparing of the vascular network and intervening areas. In some animals, anatomical tracers were directly injected into target fields without contamination of other areas. In others, multichannel electrode arrays were implanted into target areas for chronic recording of neural activity.

However, very little is known about maximizing HGF attachment to surfaces of tissue-engineered scaffolds. Here, we examine methods and kinetics of HGF adsorption onto a dense hydroxyapatite (HA) surface (used in bone implants) and determine the influence of HGF coating on osteoblast phenotype/differentiation. We demonstrate that incubating HA with HGF in solution (and not allowing the solution to dry) resulted in maximal surface adsorption that was not enhanced by extending incubation time beyond 2 days. Daily shaking of the coated HA surface did not remove adsorbed HGF. To further examine the effect of HA on osteoblast phenotype, MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were seeded onto HA or HGF-HA surfaces. Gene expression analyses indicate that HGF coating enhanced osteoblast differentiation as demonstrated by increased runx2 (a transcription factor important for osteoblast lineage and differentiation), alkaline phosphatase (marker of mid stage differentiation) and osteocalcin (marker of late stage differentiation) mRNA levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HGF can serve as an excellent bone implant coating based on its ability to readily adsorb to HA surfaces, maintain integrity over time, and enhance osteoblast differentiation.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2004-12-09", "authors": ["MHossain", "RIrwin", "M JBaumann", "L RMcCabe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.07.051"}

Each group was divided into 2 subgroups. The first subgroup received triple treatment with octreotide, galanin, and serotonin, 40 microg/kg body weight/day of each. The second subgroup was given sterile saline solution. Treatment lasted for 14 days. The volume and wet weight of the tumours in all treated groups tended to decrease, but was statistically significant only in the group with continuous i.p. infusion. The number of viable cells tended to decrease in all the treated groups, but was not statistically significant. Proliferation index was significantly reduced in mice given triple therapy i.p. as bolus injection and as continuous infusion, as compared with their respective controls. The apoptotic index increased significantly in mice receiving triple therapy as continuous i.p. infusion as revealed by both the TUNEL method and by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) expression. The number of tumour blood vessels was significantly reduced in the mice given triple therapy as continuous i.p. infusion, as compared with controls. There was no statistical difference between animals treated by different routes, regarding proliferation or apoptosis of the cancer cells, or the number or mean luminal area of tumour blood vessels. The present investigation showed that regardless of the route of administration, triple therapy with octreotide, galanin and serotonin generally reduced the volumes, weights, viable cells, vascularization and proliferation of the tumours, as well as inducing apoptosis.

Strong integrin alpha5beta1 interactions with CD97 have been identified, but alpha v beta3 also contributes to cell attachment. Furthermore, soluble CD97 acts as a potent chemoattractant for migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and this function is integrin dependent.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that the enteric flora not only exerts an important effect on innate immunity and the mucosal immune system, but will also affect inflammatory and angiogenic mechanisms involving the gut microcirculation. In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, the intestinal microcirculation and its endothelial lining will undergo activation, which will contribute to cell adhesion molecule expression and the recruitment of leukocytes into the gut wall, an early and rate limiting step in the inflammatory process. This is balanced by the fact that human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells possess specific mechanisms of endotoxin tolerance, which will diminish inflammatory activation in response to repeated bacterial activation. Likewise, the process of angiogenesis, or new blood vessel growth is influenced by the presence of bacteria, which stimulate the release of angiogenic factors from innate immune mechanisms. Conversely, bacterial derived products of dietary carbohydrate fermentation, the short chain fatty acids, will decrease angiogenic mechanisms in human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells.

Mmp2-/- mice lacked comparable defects in the lung and submandibular gland, suggesting that MT1-MMP acts via mechanisms independent of pro-MMP-2 activation.

Since pulmonary septal development requires capillary growth, the underlying mechanism of pulmonary hypoplasia in Mmp14-/- mice may be defective angiogenesis, supporting a model in which angiogenesis is a critical rate-limiting step for acquisition of pulmonary parenchymal mass.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2004-12-02", "authors": ["Samantha AOblander", "ZhongjunZhou", "Beatriz GG\u00e1lvez", "BarryStarcher", "John MShannon", "MadeleineDurbeej", "Alicia GArroyo", "KarlTryggvason", "Suneel SApte"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.09.033"}

The first and last layer, considered as horizontal two-dimensional porous media, describe irrigation and drainage of the system, respectively. The intermediate layer, described by means of a lumped parameter method, does not permit horizontal fluxes. Hierarchical fluxes are directed from the first to the second layer and then towards the drainage layer in order to take into account physiological flow direction.

{"title": "Angiostatin directly inhibits human prostate tumor cell invasion by blocking plasminogen binding to its cellular receptor, CD26.", "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrate that one of the six plasminogen type 2 glycoforms, plasminogen 2epsilon, enhances invasiveness of the 1-LN human prostate tumor cell line in an in vitro model. Binding of plasminogen 2epsilon to CD26 on the cell surface induces a Ca(2+) signaling cascade which stimulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, required by these cells to invade Matrigel. We now report that angiostatin, a fragment derived from plasminogen which prevents endothelial cell proliferation, is also a potent, direct inhibitor of 1-LN tumor cell invasiveness. We studied the effect of individual plasminogen 2 glycoform-derived angiostatins and found that only angiostatin 2epsilon binds to CD26 on the surface of 1-LN cells at a site also recognized by plasminogen 2epsilon. As a result, the plasminogen 2epsilon-induced Ca(2+) signaling cascade is inhibited, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 is suppressed, and invasion of Matrigel by 1-LN cells is blocked. Angiostatin 2epsilon is also the only angiostatin glycoform which is able to inhibit in vitro endothelial cell proliferation and tubule formation. These studies suggest that, in addition to its ability to inhibit tumor vascularization, angiostatin 2epsilon may also directly block tumor metastasis.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2004-12-02", "authors": ["MarioGonzalez-Gronow", "Hernan EGrenett", "GovindGawdi", "Salvatore VPizzo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.09.008"}

Here, we show how three pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) together stimulated the activation, but not the prior expression, of NOS-2 protein via a mechanism involving MEK-ERKs protein kinases in astrocytes from adult human cerebral temporal cortex. The cytokines triggered a transient burst of p38 MAPK activity and the production of NOS-2 mRNA which were followed by bursts of MEK-ERK activities, synthesis of the NOS-2 co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), a build-up of NOS-2 protein and from it active NOS-2 enzyme. Selectively inhibiting MEK1/MEK2, but not the earlier burst of p38 MAPK activity, with a brief exposure to U0126 between 24 and 24.5 h after adding the cytokine triad affected neither NOS-2 expression nor NOS-2 protein accumulation but stopped BH(4) synthesis and the assembly of the NOS-2 protein into active NOS-2 enzyme. The complete blockage of active NOS-2 production by the brief exposure to U0126 was bypassed by simply adding BH(4) to the culture medium. Therefore, this cytokine triad triggered two completely separable, tandem operating mechanisms in normal human astrocytes, the first being NOS-2 gene expression and accumulation of NOS-2 protein and the second being the synthesis of the BH(4) factor needed to dimerize the NOS-2 protein into active, NO-making NOS-2 enzyme.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2004-11-27", "authors": ["AnnaChiarini", "IlariaDal Pra", "RossellaGottardo", "FedericaBortolotti", "James FWhitfield", "UbaldoArmato"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.20334"}

Alcohol was administered in three different periods i.e. the whole 4 weeks before the pregnancy, during the pregnancy, and during the 4 weeks before the pregnancy plus pregnancy itself. The samples of placenta obtained from control and treated rats on days 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 21 of gestation were evaluated morphologically and fixed for histology and immunohistochemistry. Some differences in food and water consumption between the groups were determined. The placental weight, especially in the groups receiving 1 and 5 g kg(-1) day(-1) alcohol during the pregnancy, showed increases. The changes in placental histology such as increases in the number and the size of trophoblastic giant cells, cytoplasmic dissolution and nuclear polymorphism, degenerations in spongiotrophoblasts, hyperemia at the basal zone and labyrinth, hyperplasia at the labyrinth and irregular vascularization were seen particularly in the groups receiving alcohol during the pregnancy, and during the 4 weeks before the pregnancy plus pregnancy itself. Increases in the immunolocalization of TN and type IV collagen and decreases in the immunolocalization of EGF and EGFR in the placentas of alcohol-receiving rats were found.

In the present study, we hypothesized that placental vasculogenesis and angiogenesis require apoptosis during the formation of primitive vascular pattern, vessel elongation, and angiogenic branching. Vasculogenesis and apoptotic cells were identified using CD31 immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining, CD31-TUNEL double-labeling, and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM). No TUNEL-positive cell was detected in angiogenic cell islands; however, several TUNEL-positive cells were observed during the primitive lumen formation. Interestingly, some of the stromal cells located between vasculogenic areas during the endothelial tube elongation and angiogenic branching also were TUNEL-positive. The presence of morphological aspects of apoptosis, such as nuclear shrinkage and nuclear bodies (apoptotic bodies), also was confirmed in H-E-stained and TEM-depicted sections. Quantitative analysis showed that higher ratios for apoptotic cells were found in the core stroma of villi among the vascular branching areas and in the primitive capillary lumen compared to angiogenic cell cords and vasculatures with advanced lumens (P < 0.05).

Specific functions of individual MMPs as anti- or proangiogenic mediators remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we assessed the impact of single or combined MMP deficiencies in in vivo and in vitro models of angiogenesis (malignant keratinocyte transplantation and the aortic ring assay, respectively). MMP-9 was predominantly expressed by neutrophils in tumor transplants, whereas MMP-2 and MMP-3 were stromal. Neither the single deficiency of MMP-2, MMP-3, or MMP-9, nor the combined absence of MMP-9 and MMP-3 did impair tumor invasion and vascularization in vivo. However, there was a striking cooperative effect in double MMP-2:MMP-9-deficient mice as demonstrated by the absence of tumor vascularization and invasion. In contrast, the combined lack of MMP-2 and MMP-9 did not impair the in vitro capillary outgrowth from aortic rings. These results point to the importance of a cross talk between several host cells for the in vivo tumor promoting and angiogenic effects of MMP-2 and MMP-9.

We subjected transgenic mice that overexpress VEGF, and their wild-type littermates, to graded doses of acute UVB irradiation. The skin of VEGF-overexpressing mice was highly photosensitive and became erythematic when exposed to half the UVB dose required to induce erythema in wild-type mice. Erythema was associated with proliferating dermal endothelial cells, cutaneous edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. When subjected to 10 weeks of low-level UVB irradiation, no major changes were observed in wild-type mice, whereas VEGF transgenic mice developed skin damage associated with degradation of the dermal matrix and enhanced vascularization. Systemic treatment with an anti-VEGF blocking antibody reduced the sensitivity of wild-type mice to acute UVB irradiation without inhibiting post-UVB repair.

In the current study, we investigated the role of mesangial cells (MCs) in endothelial vascularization by using a three-dimensional co-culture system in basement-membrane reconstruct gel (Matrigel).\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) and human MCs were used. In the contact co-culture system, ECs and MCs were mixed and then plated together onto Matrigel. In the non-contact co-culture system, MCs were cultured within an intercup chamber, which prevented direct physical contact with the ECs on the Matrigel but allowed both cell types to share culture medium. To visualize ECs and MCs, the cells were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes prior to the co-culture. A capillary-like network formation was observed under a fluorescent microscope and confocal microscope, and the length of the network formation was quantified by the image analyzer.\nECs barely formed capillary-like networks when cultured alone in growth factor-free medium. However, ECs cultured with MCs in a contact condition remarkably formed capillary-like networks (9.10+/-0.96 vs 0.20+/-0.07 mm/mm2 at 6 h, contact vs ECs alone, P<0.001). Direct contact between ECs and MCs was clearly demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Differentiation into branching capillary-like structures was also observed in the non-contact co-culture system (3.02+/-1.21 mm/mm2 at 6 h, P<0.001 vs ECs alone), but less prominently than in the contact co-culture condition. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was secreted from MCs, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescent study. Adding neutralizing antibodies against VEGF into the co-culture system partially inhibited capillary network formation.\nOur data indicate that MCs help ECs differentiate toward vascularization, in which the direct cell-cell contact between ECs and MCs plays an important role.

The mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta receptors were analyzed in postischemic rat kidneys by ribonuclease protection, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. TGF-betaRI and -RII were enhanced within 3 days of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and remained elevated for up 7 days post-I/R; TGF-beta receptor expression was localized primarily in regenerating tubules within the outer medulla. A neutralizing TGF-beta antibody exacerbated cellular proliferation observed on day 3 postischemia but had no effect on day 1 or 2. TGF-beta antibody treatment had no measurable effect on loss of renal function or the restoration of renal function during the recovery response for up to 35 days postsurgery. However, ischemic injury resulted in modest renal hypertrophy that is due, in part, to in an increase in the number of interstitial cells in the postischemic kidney. Immunohistochemistry showed that several of these cells stained positively for the fibroblast-specific marker, S100A4 positive. Anti-TGF-beta treatment substantially attenuated the renal hypertrophy, interstitial cellularity, and S100A4-positive cells present at 35 days post-I/R. Finally, TGF-beta immunoneutralization attenuated the loss of renal vascular density following recovery from I/R injury. These data suggest that the TGF-beta/TbetaR system is enhanced in the postischemic kidney.

Tumor progression and metastatic dissemination still represent major obstacles to the successful treatment of advanced stage disease. In order to develop and evaluate new, targeted, therapeutic strategies, fully defined and biologically relevant in vivo models of NB are strongly needed. We have developed an orthotopic model of metastatic human NB in the nude mouse, using 2 well-characterized NB cell lines. Tumor growth, vascular properties and metastatic patterns were investigated using a sensitive and newly developed in vivo echographic technology in addition to immunohistochemistry and PCR analyses. Results show that implantation of low numbers of NB cells directly into the adrenal gland of nude mice resulted in rapid and homogeneous tumor growth without tumor morbidity. Nude mice were shown to rapidly develop highly vascularized adrenal tumors that selectively metastasized to the liver and bone marrow. In addition, the newly formed mouse vessels in orthotopic but not in heterotopic tumors, were found to express the highly angiogenic alphavbeta3 integrin marker, indicating the development of a truly malignant neovasculature in orthotopic conditions only. This observation confirms the impact of the regional microenvironment on tumor biology and suggests the existence of cross-talk with the tumor cells. In conclusion, such model faithfully reproduces the growth, vascular and metastatic patterns as observed in patients.

Although ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is a target of LH in the ovary, the functional significance of ODC induction has remained elusive. Our study reveals that the blockade of the induction of ovarian ODC by means of the specific inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) affects folliculogenesis and luteinization. In immature female mice, DFMO was found to inhibit ovarian growth, the formation of Graafian follicles, and the secretion of progesterone and estradiol. In adult cycling females, the administration of DFMO on the evening/night of proestrus markedly decreased plasma progesterone levels at diestrus, which was associated to the decrease in the expression of steroidogenic factor 1, cytochrome cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme, and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in the ovary and to a reduced vascularization of the corpora lutea. These effects were not reverted by the administration of gonadotropins or prolactin. ODC immunoreactivity was also stimulated by LH in theca and granulosa cells of antral follicles but not in preantral follicles.

Patients had serial dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging studies to measure changes in tumor vascular parameters.\nThree of eight patients developed significant ascites, and seven of eight showed evidence of fluid retention. In some patients, the ratio of vascular volume to total tumor volume increased significantly (P < .001) within 24 hours following CDP860 administration, an effect suggestive of recruitment of previously non-functioning vessels.\nThese observations suggest that inhibition of PDGFR-beta might improve delivery of a concurrently administered therapy. However, in cancer patients, further exploration of the dosing regimen of CDP860 is required to dissociate adverse effects from beneficial effects. The findings challenge the view that inhibition of PDGF alone is beneficial, and confirm that effects of PDGFR kinase inhibition mediate, to some extent, the fluid retention observed in patients treated with mixed tyrosine kinase inhibitors.", "journal": "Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology", "date": "2004-10-07", "authors": ["G CJayson", "G J MParker", "SMullamitha", "J WValle", "MSaunders", "LBroughton", "JLawrance", "BCarrington", "CRoberts", "BIssa", "D LBuckley", "SCheung", "KDavies", "YWatson", "KZinkewich-P\u00e9otti", "LRolfe", "AJackson"], "doi": "10.1200/JCO.2005.01.032"}

Calcium dobesilate (DOBE) has been tested in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy showing a slowdown of the progression of the disease after long-term oral treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of DOBE on vascular and diabetic retinopathy in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats.\nDiabetes was induced in wistar rats by the administration of STZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.). Rats were divided into three groups (n = 30). Group 0 (GO): nondiabetic rats. Group 1 (G1): 14 months of insulin treatment after diabetes development. Group 2 (G2): 14 months of insulin treatment after diabetes development plus DOBE (500 mg/kg/day). At the end of the treatment, vascular reactivity was tested. The study of the vascularization of the retina was performed on wholemounts of trypsin retinal digest preparations and retinal sections.\nRelaxation induced by acetylcholine decreased in the aorta arteries from diabetic rats but it was restored to control values in the DOBE-treated group (71.8 +/- 4.5%, 53.3 +/- 0.5%, 67.4 +/- 4.6% in group 0, 1 and 2 respectively). DOBE treatment also restored noradrenaline (1.08 +/- 0.05 g, 1.70 +/- 0.08 g, 1.13 +/- 0.05 g in group 0, 1 and 2 respectively) and caffeine-induced contractions. Diabetic state did not cause any alteration in mesenteric arteries. The analysis of the retinal digests showed vascular tortuosity, acellular capillaries, focal accumulations of capillaries and reduction of the number of pericytes in G1. The vascular changes observed in G2 seem to be intermediate between the control and the diabetic rats.\nWe showed that long-term treatment with DOBE attenuated the progression of diabetic retinopathy and the alterations in vascular reactivity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.", "journal": "Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews", "date": "2004-09-24", "authors": ["EugeniaPadilla", "PatriciaGanado", "MercedesSanz", "MiriamZeini", "EmilioRuiz", "AlbertoTrivi\u00f1o", "Ana IRam\u00edrez", "Juan JSalazar", "Jose MRam\u00edrez", "BlancaRojas", "Rosa deHoz", "TeresaTejerina"], "doi": "10.1002/dmrr.487"}
{"title": "Preoperative transarterial embolization of vertebral metastases.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative devascularization of spinal metastases in relation to the preembolization tumor vascularization degree and in relation to the intraoperative blood loss. Twenty-four patients underwent preoperative transarterial embolization of hypervascular spinal metastases. Each tumor was assigned a vascularization grade (I-III) according to tumor blush after contrast agent injection in the main feeding artery. Embolization was performed with polyvinyl alcohol particles in all patients. Surgical reports were reviewed in terms of estimated blood loss. A mild hypervascularization was found in three patients (group I), medium in six patients (group II) and extensive in 15 patients (group III). In 22 out of 24 patients embolization could be performed with a complete devascularization. In two patients, only partial embolization could be performed, due to the main feeding artery arising from the artery of Adamkiewicz. In patients with complete devascularization the mean intraoperative blood loss was 1,900 ml, whereas in the two patients who were not embolized it was 5,500 ml. Intraoperative blood loss was not correlated to the vascularization grade. Angiography and embolization could be performed in all patients without causing permanent neurologic deficit, skin or muscle necrosis. The surgeons concluded that radical tumor resection after embolization was facilitated. Intraoperative blood loss is not correlated with the pre-interventional vascularization degree, if complete devascularization can be achieved with embolization. Preoperative embolization of vertebral hypervascular tumors is safe, effective and facilitates tumor resection.", "journal": "European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society", "date": "2004-09-21", "authors": ["RaphaelGuzman", "SusanDubach-Schwizer", "PaulHeini", "Karl-OlofLovblad", "DanielKalbermatten", "GerhardSchroth", "LucaRemonda"], "doi": "10.1007/s00586-004-0757-6\n10.1007/s002709900165"}
{"title": "Distal angiogenesis: a new concept for lung vascular morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Although several molecular players have been described that play a role during the early phases of lung development, it is still unknown how the vasculature develops in relation to the airways. Two opposing models describe development of lung vasculature: one suggests that both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are involved, whereas the second describes vasculogenesis as the primary mechanism. Therefore, we examined the development of the murine pulmonary vasculature through a morphological analysis from the onset of lung development [9.5 days postcoital (dpc)] until the pseudoglandular stage (13.5 dpc). We analyzed fetal lungs of Tie2-LacZ transgenic mice as well as serial sections of wild-type lungs stained with endothelial-specific antibodies (Flk-1, Fli-1, and PECAM-1). Embryos were processed with intact blood circulation to maintain the integrity of the vasculature; hence individual vessels could be identified with accuracy through serial section analysis. Furthermore, circulating primitive erythrocytes, formed exclusively by the blood islands in the yolk sac, are trapped in vessels during fixation, which proves the connection with the embryonic circulation. We report that from the first morphological sign of lung development, a clear vascular network exists that is in contact with the embryonic circulation. We propose distal angiogenesis as a new concept for early pulmonary vascular morphogenesis. In this model, capillary networks surround the terminal buds and expand by formation of new capillaries from preexisting vessels as the lung bud grows. The fact that at an early embryonic stage a complete vascular network exists may be important for the general understanding of embryonic development.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Vascular leukocytes contribute to tumor vascularization.", "abstract": "There is no proof that hematopoietic cells contribute significantly to vasculogenesis in postnatal life. Here we report a novel leukocyte subset within ovarian carcinoma that coexpresses endothelial and dendritic cell markers. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis identified a high frequency of VE-cadherin+ CD45+ leukocytes (39% of host cells) in 10 of 10 solid tumors evaluated. This population represented less than 1% of nontumor cells in ascites and peripheral blood. At the protein level, more than 86% of these cells expressed the endothelial markers P1H12, CD34, and CD31 and leukocyte markers CD11c and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. At the mRNA level, we detected TEM1, TEM7, and Thy-1, specific markers of angiogenic endothelium. Finally, this population has the capacity to generate functional blood vessels in vivo. Because of its mixed phenotype, we named this population vascular leukocytes (VLCs).

{"title": "Osteoarthritis, angiogenesis and inflammation.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis and inflammation are closely integrated processes in osteoarthritis (OA) and may affect disease progression and pain. Inflammation can stimulate angiogenesis, and angiogenesis can facilitate inflammation. Angiogenesis can also promote chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral ossification, contributing to radiographic changes in the joint. Inflammation sensitizes nerves, leading to increased pain. Innervation can also accompany vascularization of the articular cartilage, where compressive forces and hypoxia may stimulate these new nerves, causing pain even after inflammation has subsided. Inhibition of inflammation and angiogenesis may provide effective therapeutics for the treatment of OA by improving symptoms and retarding joint damage. This review aims to summarize (i) the evidence that angiogenesis and inflammation play an important role in the pathophysiology of OA and (ii) possible directions for future research into therapeutics that could effectively treat this disease.", "journal": "Rheumatology (Oxford, England)", "date": "2004-08-05", "authors": ["C SBonnet", "D AWalsh"], "doi": "10.1093/rheumatology/keh344"}

In all, 10 eyes had lime burns and five eyes had acid burns. There were three eyes of grade II, four eyes of grade III and eight eyes of grade IV burns. AMT was performed within 3 weeks of injury.\nPatients were followed up for 10.14 +/- 4.41 months. All patients had immediate relief of pain postoperatively. Of 15 eyes, nine (60%) showed epithelialization within 1-4 weeks (15.33 +/- 9.91 days). The final visual acuity improved in 10 of 15 eyes (66.66%). Eyes with burns of grade II and III showed more visual improvement than those with grade IV burns. None of the eyes showed perforation. Symblepharon was seen in nine of 15 eyes (60%). Of 15 eyes, 12 (80%) experienced limbal stem cell deficiency and showed superficial corneal vascularization.\nAmniotic membrane transplantation with fresh amniotic membrane increases patient comfort and reduces inflammation. In mild burns, AMT alone restores corneal and conjunctival surfaces. In moderate to severe burns, it probably reduces conjunctival scarring sequelae, but does not prevent the sequelae of limbal stem cell deficiency that requires further limbal stem cell transplantation. In the acute stage, amniotic membrane transplantation probably has a protective role against the progressive melting and perforation.", "journal": "Eye (London, England)", "date": "2004-08-03", "authors": ["RArora", "DMehta", "VJain"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.eye.6701490"}

{"title": "Steroid effects on osteogenesis through mesenchymal cell gene expression.", "abstract": "We have studied the mechanism of steroid-induced osteonecrosis by examining the effect of dexamethasone on a multipotential cell line, D1, which is derived from bone marrow and is capable of differentiating into either the osteoblast or the adipocyte lineage. The expression of bone cell and fat cell transcription factors Cbfa1/Runx2 and PPARgamma2, were determined. Osteocalcin promoter activity was measured by co-transfecting the cells with the phOC-luc and pSV beta-Gal plasmids. Dexamethasone increased PPARgamma2 gene expression 2-fold, while Cbfa1/Runx2 gene expression and osteocalcin promoter activity decreased by 50-60%, and VEGF protein, measured by ELISA, decreased by 55%. These changes indicate enhanced adipogenesis and decreased osteogenesis by mesenchymal cells in vitro, together with a decrease in VEGF, a potent angiogeneic factor, suggesting that dexamethasone may shunt uncommitted osteoprogenitor cells in marrow from osteoblastic differentiation into the adipocytic pathway, leading to diminished vascularization and eventual osteonecrosis.", "journal": "Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA", "date": "2004-06-19", "authors": ["XudongLi", "LiJin", "QuanjunCui", "Gwo-JawWang", "GaryBalian"], "doi": "10.1007/s00198-004-1649-7"}
