{"title": "On the optimality of magnetic resonance tag patterns for heart wall motion estimation.", "abstract": "Tracking of cardiac motion using magnetic resonance tagging has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Several methods for tagging the cardiac tissue and tracking the motion of the tags have been developed. However, the choice of tag pattern that minimizes tracking error has received less attention. In this paper, we are concerned with the optimal tagging and acquisition of MR tagged images for cardiac motion analysis. We formulate the measurement of tissue deformation as a multidimensional parametric estimation problem which can be solved using the nonlinear least squares estimator. Along with this, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the average estimation error variance. We then show that under certain conditions a complex sinusoidal tag shape minimizes the CRLB. We validate our results with computer simulations. Finally, based on the previous findings, we make recommendations concerning the most desirable imaging strategy for images tagged with a complex sinusoidal tag pattern.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "date": "2008-02-02", "authors": ["Thanh DNguyen", "Stanley JReeves", "Thomas RDenney"], "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2003.812387"}
{"title": "Working heart off-pump cardiac repair (OPCARE)--the next step in robotic surgery?", "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to assess the feasibility of working heart off-pump cardiac repair (OPCARE), for example, for simple congenital defects or valves, with the help of a commercially available surgical robot in order to identify problem areas and to explore potential solutions. OPCARE was studied in four bovine experiments using the Zeus (Computermotion, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) surgical robot providing 3D viewing of the extra cardiac instruments in combination with two intra-cardiac ultrasound visualisation systems (Clearview Ultra, Boston Scientific, La Garenne, France) and Accunav (Accuson, Mountain View, CA, USA) allowing for two different viewing planes of the heart and identification of both, intra-cardiac structures and intra-cardiac robotic instruments. For the given experimental set-up, introduction of robotic instruments into the right atrium (typical for instrumentation during OPCARE), grabbing of the second instrument (typical for removal of intra-cardiac foreign bodies), and grabbing of relatively still atrial structures, which can be visualised by intra-cardiac ultrasound (typical for resection of specific cardiac tissue, clipping of a specific cardiac structure, steered access to other cardiac cavities) have been realised with relative ease. In contrast, grabbing of moving cardiac structures like a-v valve leaflets (typical for valve testing and absolutely necessary for valve repair) required, in general, numerous attempts, but was finally successful in the majority of test animals. Finally, introduction of self-attaching suture material (U-clips, Coalescent Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) typical for edge-to-edge valve repair could not be performed in reproducible fashion with the equipment used. We conclude that OPCARE is feasible for simple intra-cardiac lesions using current robotic instrumentation and state of the art intra-cardiac ultrasound.

{"title": "[Collagen membrane as scaffold for the three-dimensional cultivation of cardiac cells in vitro].", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop research of cardiac cells to reestablish 3D tissue architecture in vitro, we performed studies using collagen membrane as three-dimensional scaffold for cardiac cells culture with the principles and methods of tissue engineering. The polymer scaffold provides a 3-D substrate for cell attachment and tissue formation. Cardiac cells isolated by enzymatic digestion from 1d old neonatal rats were seeded to three-dimensional collagen scaffolds and tissue culture plates. The morphology, beating rate and the metabolic indexes, including specific consumption rate of glucose (q(glu)) , specific production rate of lactate (q(lac)), lactate transform rate ( Y(lac/glu)), specific creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities of cardiac cells cultured on three-dimensional collagen membrane and tissue culture plates were compared. It was found that cells shape and cells' CK and LDH activity was no differences between 3D and 2D cultures and cell beat rate on cell culture cluster was slower than those cells cultured on collagen membrane, However the cell glucose consumption and lactate yield rate of cells cultured on cluster was higher than those cells cultured on collagen membrane. After 5 days of cultivation, cardiac cells cultured on collagen membrane scaffolds organized into three-dimensional (3D) aggregates as opposed to the two-dimensional (2D) aggregates mosaic pattern seen in tissue culture plates, and spontaneous and rhythmical contractile 3D cultures in unison were visible to the naked eye and the area of synchronous contract three-dimensional (3D) aggregates reaches 80cm2. The mean value of q(glu), q(lac) and Y(lac/glu) of cultured on three-dimensional collagen scaffold was 7.37 micromol/10(6) cells/d, 2.92 micromol/10(6) cells/ d and 0.38 micromol/micromol, versus 7.59 micromol/10(6)cells/d, 3.83 micromol/10(6) cells/d and 0.51 micromol/micromol in tissue culture plates. These results demonstrate that cardiac cells immobilized on collagen membrane in 3D cultures maintain similar metabolic activity and contractile function when compared with native cardiac cells.

They are stored in platelet dense granules in a metabolically inactive form. Ap(n)A form a class of dinucleotides, including diadenosine triphosphate (Ap3A), diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A) and diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6A) which have vasopressor actions in some tissues and vasodilator actions in others. Ap(n)A have been reported to interact with receptors distinct from P1 and P2-purinoceptors, and the presence of a unique Ap4A receptor has been demonstrated in isolated ventricular myocytes. Despite the identification of this receptor, other studies suggest that some of the cardiovascular effects are mediated by purinoceptors. Ap(n)A are released from platelet dense granules into the circulation during the platelet release reaction where they can reduce heart rate. The existence of Ap(n)A in myocardial tissue and platelet granules as well as their effects on coronary artery tone and myocardial function suggests a regulatory role for these compounds in the heart. This review describes the effects of Ap(n)A in terms of their coronary vasomotor and cardiac electrophysiological effects. The mechanism responsible for these effects is reviewed; including the involvement of purinergic receptors, the effects of alterations in extracellular pH and the contribution of nitric oxide and prostanoids. Potential pro-arrhythmogenic effects of diadenosine polyphosphates during myocardial ischaemia are also discussed as these compounds could contribute to inhomogeneities of repolarization in ischaemic myocardium.", "journal": "Current medicinal chemistry.

Trypanosoma cruzi infection induces a CD8-mediated myocarditis in patients with severe cardiomyopathy and experimental animals. Previously, we have proposed that this predominance of CD8+ T-cells is, at least in part, consequence of the differential expression of CAMs on circulating CD8+ lymphocytes. In the present study we investigated the participation of CAMs in shaping the phenotypic nature of the autoimmune CD4-mediated myosin-induced and the CD8-mediated T. cruzi-elicited myocarditis. We provide evidence that the prevalence of a certain T-cell subset inside the inflamed heart reflects the differential profile of the adhesion molecules VLA-4, LFA-1, and ICAM-1 displayed on a large proportion of this particular T-cell population in peripheral blood during the early phase of inflammation. Further, the expression of VCAM-1, ligand for VLA-4, and ICAM-1, counter-receptor for LFA-1, was up-regulated on vascular endothelium and paralleled the entrance of inflammatory cells into the cardiac tissue. Thus, this up-regulated expression of receptors-counter-receptors that regulate T-cell transmigration through the vascular endothelium may have an important role in the pathogenesis of the early phase of both autoimmune and infectious myocarditis.", "journal": "Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz", "date": "2004-02-06", "authors": ["Ana Paula M PMarino", "Maria In\u00eas PAzevedo", "JoseliLannes-Vieira"], "doi": "10.1590/s0074-02762003000700015"}

{"title": "Detecting instabilities of cardiac rhythm.", "abstract": "Diminished beat-to-beat variations in cardiac cycle lengths (CLs) are associated with poor prognosis after acute myocardial infarction and in patients with heart failure. Short-long-short sequences of cardiac cycles, or ultra-short rhythm instabilities, precede initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in some patients. However, little is known about clinical or prognostic significance of abrupt short-term instabilities in CL (AICL) that occur minutes to hours before the event, in part because appropriate analytical methods are lacking. Although various techniques have been used to analyze CL changes, methods for analysis of AICL are limited. We compared performance of time domain, spectral, nonlinear, and pattern recognition techniques with respect to the detection and quantification of AICL. Because of high intra- and inter-subject variability of CL, pattern recognition techniques compared favorably to other studied methods. In continuous ambulatory ECG recordings, AICL occurred hours before spontaneous initiation of sustained atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in different patient populations. AICL were also found prior to the onset of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in a mouse model of congestive heart failure. To quantify AICL, we used the number of unstable orthogonal projection coefficients; this number gradually increased hours before the event. Removal of ectopic beats reduced but did not eliminate AICL. To illustrate potential physiological effects and temporal evolution of AICL, we used a simple, continuous, two-dimensional model of cardiac tissue governed by the Morris-Lecar equations. Computer simulations in this model showed that AICL may lead to gradual accumulation of spatial irregularities of the propagation wavefront giving rise to the initiation of reentry. Time-frequency analysis of the most significant eigenvectors of cardiac rhythm in subjects undergoing head-up tilt showed that AICL could indicate instabilities and unsuccessful adaptation of autonomic nervous system activity to physiological stimuli.", "journal": "Journal of electrocardiology", "date": "2004-01-13", "authors": ["VladimirShusterman", "BenhurAysin", "G BardErmentrout", "BarryLondon", "DavidSchwartzman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2003.09.063"}

It is attributed to anemia caused by viral-induced destruction of red blood cells. Infection of other organs has been reported including the heart, liver, and lungs. Few of these reports, however, convincingly demonstrate virions within the functional parenchyma of the tissue. This is of particular concern regarding myocardium in the context of hydrops fetalis which is, in part, due to cardiac failure. The problem in routine pathology practice is that most fetuses with the infection are macerated. This, in part, probably explains the paucity of published information on cardiac involvement. This study examined five cases of fatal hydrops fetalis with variable maceration with serologically proven parvovirus B19 infection. Transmission electron microscopy of cardiac tissue demonstrated intranuclear virions in both erythroid precursor cells and in cardiac myocytes in three of these cases. In each of these, immuno-gold electron microscopy provided confirmatory evidence of parvovirus infection. Virions were not identifiable where maceration had caused disintegration of nuclei in the myocytes. In addition, virions were absent in the three negative control cases where retroplacental hemorrhage was confirmed as the cause of death. This study suggests that parvovirus infection of cardiac myocytes may play a more important role in causing hydrops fetalis than previously realized. It also demonstrates that maceration should not discourage the use of electron microscopy.", "journal": "Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society", "date": "2004-01-08", "authors": ["AiveenO'Malley", "CaroleBarry-Kinsella", "CarolineHughes", "PeterKelehan", "DeirdreDevaney", "EoghanMooney", "JohnGillan"], "doi": "10.1007/s10024-001-0269-x"}

Acute and chronic viral hepatitis can be associated with cardiovascular derangements. Protein Fv induced the release of histamine, tryptase and the de novo synthesis of prostaglandin D(2) and cysteinyl leukotriene C(4) from mast cells isolated from human heart tissue (HHMC). Protein Fv absorbed with protein A-Sepharose coated with polyclonal IgG did not induce histamine secretion. The maximal percent histamine secretion induced by protein Fv correlated (r(s) = 0.60; p < 0.05) with that induced by anti-IgE, whereas there was no correlation between the release caused by proteins Fv and C5a. Preincubation of HHMC with protein Fv or anti-IgE caused complete cross-desensitization to subsequent challenge with heterologous stimulus. HHMC from which IgE had been dissociated no longer released histamine in response to anti-IgE and protein Fv. A human monoclonal IgE blocked both anti-IgE- and protein Fv-induced release. Three human monoclonal IgM V(H)3(+) inhibited protein-Fv-induced secretion of histamine from HHMC, whereas monoclonal IgM V(H)6(+) did not inhibit the release induced by protein Fv. Protein Fv acts as an endogenous immunoglobulin superantigen by interacting with the V(H)3 domain of IgE to induce the release of mediators from HHMC.", "journal": "International archives of allergy and immunology", "date": "2004-01-07", "authors": ["ArturoGenovese", "GuglielmoBorgia", "Jean-PierreBouvet", "AikateriniDetoraki", "Amatode Paulis", "MarcelloPiazza", "GianniMarone"], "doi": "10.1159/000074901"}

{"title": "Action potential modulation of connexin40 gap junctional conductance.", "abstract": "Connexin40 (Cx40) is abundantly expressed in the atrial myocardium, ventricular conduction system, and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the mammalian cardiovascular system. Rapid conduction through cardiac tissues depends on electrotonic transfer of the action potential between neighboring cells. To determine whether transjunctional voltages (Vj) elicited by an action potential can modulate conductance of Cx40 gap junctions, simulated myocardial action potentials were applied as voltage-clamp waveforms to Cx40 gap junctions expressed in mouse neuro2A (N2A) cells. Junctional currents resembled the action potential morphology but declined by >50% from peak to near-constant plateau values. Kinetics of Cx40 voltage gating were examined at peak voltages > or =100 mV, and decay time constants changed e-fold per 17.6 mV for Vj > +/-40 mV. Junctional conductance recovered during phase 3 repolarization and early diastole to initial values. These phasic changes in junctional conductance were due to rapid decay kinetics, increasing to tens of milliseconds at peak Vj of 130 mV, and the increase in the steady-state conductance curve as Vj returned toward 0 mV. Time-dependent conductance curves for Cx40 were modeled with one inactivation and two recovery Vj-dependent components. There was a temporal correlation between development of conduction delay or block and the inactivation phase of junctional conductance. Likewise, recovery of junctional conductance was coincident with recovery from refractoriness, suggesting that gap junctions may play a role in the genesis and propagation of cardiac arrhythmias.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Myocardial density and composition: a basis for calculating intracellular metabolite concentrations.", "abstract": "Systems for describing myocardial cellular metabolism with appropriate thermodynamic constraints on reactions have to be on the basis of estimates of intracellular and mitochondrial concentrations of metabolites as driving forces for reactions. This requires that tissue composition itself must be modeled, but there is marked inconsistency in the literature and no full data set on hearts of any species. To formulate a self-consistent set of information on the densities, contents, or concentrations of chemical components and volumes of tissue spaces, we drew on information mostly on rats. From the data on densities, volumes, volume fractions, and mass fractions observed mainly on left ventricular myocardium, cytoplasm, and mitochondria and from morphometric data on cellular components and the vasculature, we constructed a matrix based on conservation laws for density, volume, and constituent composition. The four constituents were water, protein, fat, and solutes (or ash). To take into account the variances in the observed data sets, we used a constrained nonlinear least squares optimization to minimize the differences between the final results and the data sets. The results provide a detailed estimate of cardiac tissue composition, previously unavailable, for the translation of whole tissue concentrations or concentrations per gram protein into estimated local concentrations that are relevant to reaction processes. An example is that the concentrations of phosphocreatine and ATP in cytosolic water space are twice as high as their mean tissue concentrations.

Immunohistochemical studies for characterization of adduct distribution revealed sarcolemmal adducts of both MDA and AA in the rats treated with ethanol and cyanamide in addition to intracellular adducts, which were also present in the group treated with ethanol alone.\nThese findings support the role of enhanced lipid peroxidation and the generation of protein-aldehyde condensates in vivo as a result of excessive ethanol intake.

Western blot analysis showed that AM infusion accelerated Akt phosphorylation in cardiac tissues and that pretreatment with wortmannin significantly attenuated AM-induced Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, pretreatment with wortmannin abolished the beneficial effects of AM: a reduction of infarct size, a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and inhibition of myocardial apoptosis after ischemia/reperfusion.\nShort-term infusion of AM significantly attenuated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.

{"title": "Three-dimensional pseudospectral modelling of cardiac propagation in an inhomogeneous anisotropic tissue.", "abstract": "Various investigators have used the monodomain model to study cardiac propagation behaviour. In many cases, the governing non-linear parabolic equation is solved using the finite-difference method. An adequate discretisation of cardiac tissue with realistic dimensions, however, often leads to a large model size that is computationally demanding. Recently, it has been demonstrated, for a two-dimensional homogeneous monodomain, that the Chebyshev pseudospectral method can offer higher computational efficiency than the finite-difference technique. Here, an extension of the pseudospectral approach to a three-dimensional inhomogeneous case with fibre rotation is presented. The unknown transmembrane potential is expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomial trial functions, and the monodomain equation is enforced at the Gauss-Lobatto node points. The forward Euler technique is used to advance the solution in time. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate that the Chebyshev pseudospectral method offered an even larger improvement in computational performance over the finite-difference method in the three-dimensional case. Specifically, the pseudospectral method allowed the number of nodes to be reduced by approximately 85 times, while the same solution accuracy was maintained.

Our goal is to determine how an elevated extracellular potassium ion concentration, [K]o, affects the mechanism of anodal excitation and influences the anodal strength-interval curve.\nComputer simulations of unipolar stimulation were performed using the bidomain model, with membrane kinetics governed by the Luo-Rudy model. The diastolic threshold for anodal stimulation first decreased and then increased with increasing [K]o, reaching a minimum value at [K]o = 12 mM. The mechanism for diastolic anodal excitation was make for all [K]o values except 13.3 mM, in which case it was break. For low [K]o (4 and 8 mM) the break section of the anodal strength-interval contained a \"dip,\" but for high [K]o (12 and 13 mM), the dip disappeared.\nHigh [K]o predisposes cardiac tissue to break excitation, which is thought to play an important role in reentry induction and defibrillation.

Sections of heart ventricle and renal and hepatic tissue were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined by light microscopy to identify vanadium-induced tissue injury. In addition, PicroSirius-stained ventricular sections were analyzed by bipolarized light microscopy to determine the fraction of myocardium occupied by the ventricular wall structural elements (collagen I, collagen III, and cardiac muscle). Both vanadate solutions produced similar effects in the renal tissue. Morphological alterations included damaged renal tubules showing disorganized epithelial cells in different states of necrosis.

Cardiac enlargement occurred only when GLUT4 levels were less than 5% of normal values. In heart there is a threshold level of GLUT4 above which insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is maintained. As little as 5% of normal GLUT4 levels expressed in heart is sufficient to prevent the development of cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Journal of molecular endocrinology", "date": "2003-12-11", "authors": ["S JKaczmarczyk", "SAndrikopoulos", "JFavaloro", "A ADomenighetti", "ADunn", "MErnst", "DGrail", "MFodero-Tavoletti", "C EHuggins", "L MDelbridge", "J DZajac", "JProietto"], "doi": "10.1677/jme.0.0310449"}

Shedding of membrane-bound pro-TNF-alpha is thought to be largely due to TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE).\nRelease of TNF-alpha and TACE dependency were studied in isolated rat hearts and in the human mast cell line HMC-1.\nIn reperfused hearts, interstitial release of TNF-alpha occurred in two phases (2-10 and >45 min). It depended on the presence of oxygen during reperfusion and was attenuated by reduced glutathione. Infusion of the oxidants H(2)O(2) or HOCl elicited release in non-ischemic hearts. TNF-alpha release was inhibited in hearts treated with degranulation inhibitors ketotifen or cromoglycate, suggesting mast cells as major source for myocardial TNF-alpha. This was confirmed by tissue staining. Post-ischemic release of histamine, however, did not parallel that of TNF-alpha. Heart tissue contained mainly mature TACE. HMC-1 expressed abundant pro-TACE and cleaved the pro-TNF-alpha-peptide Ac-SPLAQAVRSSSR-NH(2). However, cleavage was nonspecific and only partly inhibited by TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 (10-100 micromol/l), while it was stimulated by H(2)O(2) and HOCl and fully blocked by the nonspecific metalloprotease inhibitor o-phenanthroline.\nThe mechanism underlying TNF-alpha release from post-ischemic myocardium is oxidation-dependent but largely independent of activation of TACE.

A single dose of Dox 15 mg/kg i.p. induced cardiotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity [EC 2.7.3.2]. Moreover, cardiotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant increase in lipid peroxides, measured as malon-di-aldehyde (MDA) in cardiac tissue homogenates. The administration of L-NAME 4 mg/kg/d p.o. in drinking water 5 days before and 3 days after the Dox injection significantly ameliorated the cardiotoxic effects of Dox, judged by the improvement in both serum CPK activity and lipid peroxides in the cardiac tissue homogenates. On the other hand, the administration of L-arginine 70 mg/kg/d p.o. did not protect the cardiac tissues against the toxicity that was induced by the Dox treatment. The findings of this study suggest that L-NAME can attenuate the cardiac dysfunction that is produced by the Dox treatment via the mechanism(s), which may involve the inhibition of the nitric oxide (NO) formation.

With the use of data from a recent experimental study in a murine heart, a three-dimensional anisotropic bidomain model of the mouse ventricular free wall was developed to study the currents and potentials resulting from the application of a point mechanical load on cardiac tissue. The applied pressure is assumed to open nonspecific pressure-sensitive channels depolarizing the membrane, leading to monophasic currents at the electrode edge that give rise to the monophasic action potential (MAP). The results show that the magnitude and the time course of the MAP are reproduced only for certain combinations of local or global intracellular and interstitial resistances that form a resting tissue length constant that, if applied over the entire domain, is smaller than that required to match the wave speed.

{"title": "Heme oxygenase in diabetes-induced oxidative stress in the heart.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population. Increased oxidative stress has been associated with the pathogenesis of chronic diabetic complications including cardiomyopathy. Multiple biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to increase oxidative stress in diabetes. The present study was aimed at elucidating the role of a potent oxidative and cellular stress-responsive system, the heme oxygenase (HO) system, in the heart in diabetes. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with a potent inhibitor of HO system, tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX, 50 micromol/kg/d), and were compared with untreated diabetic and non-diabetic animals. All treatments began at the onset of diabetes, 48 h after injection of streptozotocin along with the confirmation of hyperglycemia. Animals were euthanized after 1 week and 1 month of treatment, and heart tissues were harvested. Frozen tissues were subjected to HO-1 and HO-2 mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR and HO activity determination. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were used for immunohistochemical analysis of HO-1 and HO-2. 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) stain, a sensitive and specific marker of DNA damage, was preformed to assess damage induced by oxidative stress. In addition, tissue sections were subjected to histochemical analysis for iron. We further examined non-diabetic animals treated with a direct HO agonist, hemin (50 mg/kg/d). A possible relationship between the HO and the nitric oxide (NO) pathways was also considered by studying the mRNA levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and inducible NOS, and by measuring the amount of NOS products. Our results demonstrate no significant alterations of the HO system following 1 week of diabetes. However, 1 month of diabetes caused increased oxidative stress as demonstrated by higher levels of 8-OHdG-positive cardiomyocytes (80% positive as compared to 11.25% in controls), in association with increased HO isozyme mRNA (2.7-fold increase as compared to controls) and protein expression, and augmented HO activity (759.3 as compared to 312.3 pmol BR/h/mg protein in controls). Diabetic rats further demonstrated increased number of cardiomyocytes with stainable iron. SnPPIX treatment resulted in reduced number of 8-OHdG-positive cardiomyocytes (19.5% as compared to 80% in diabetics) in parallel with reduced HO activity (569.7 as compared to 759.3 pmol BR/h/mg protein in diabetics). Non-diabetic rats treated with HO-agonist hemin exhibited abnormalities similar to diabetic rats. Our results provide the first direct demonstration that diabetes-induced oxidative stress in the heart is, in part, due to upregulated HO expression and activity. These results provide evidence of pro-oxidant activity of HO in the heart in diabetes, which could be mediated by increased redox-active iron.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2003-12-05", "authors": ["HanaFarhangkhoee", "Zia AKhan", "SuranjanaMukherjee", "MarkCukiernik", "Yousef PBarbin", "MorrisKarmazyn", "SubrataChakrabarti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2003.09.007"}
{"title": "Mitochondria respiration and susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic hearts.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular complications are the primary cause of death for diabetic patients. Clinical and experimental observation has showed the development of dysfunctional cardiomyopathy as one of the main complications of diabetes. Whether the cardiomyopathy results from an increased susceptibility of cardiac tissue to ischemic insult or from a specific functional defect of cardiac mitochondria is a controversial issue. The investigation of possible functional defect in cardiac mitochondria from diabetic rats indicates a decline in state 3 respiration only in animals presenting a marked decrease in body weight. Mitochondria from rats presenting a level of hyperglycemia similar to diabetic animals but not the marked weight loss typical of the latter group show no decline in state 3 respiration, the values being indistinguishable from those of control mitochondria. Mitochondria from hyperglycemic rats, however, show a 15-20% increase in state 4 oxygen consumption but only when glutamate is used as energetic substrate, as compared to a 40-50% increase in state 4 respiration in mitochondria from diabetic rats under similar experimental conditions. This phenomenon is unrelated to diabetes duration, as it is observed at 2 as well as 8 weeks after diabetes onset. Taken together, these data argue against hyperglycemia per se being a direct cause of the decline in state 3 oxygen consumption observed in cardiac mitochondria of type-I diabetic rats and indicate that differences exist in cardiac mitochondrial function in rats generically labeled as diabetic. These differences can contribute to explain discrepancies in experimental results reported by various groups in the field and provide an additional parameter to be taken into consideration in evaluating the varying sensitivity of diabetic hearts to ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2003-12-05", "authors": ["OssamaLashin", "AndreaRomani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2003.09.024"}

We found that the tip of E describes a vector-loop during depolarization with the peak field, E, pointing opposite to the direction of propagation, phiI(m). Experimentally recorded loop morphologies of E, however, frequently showed significant deviations from the theoretically predicted behavior. We hypothesized that this variety of morphologies might be caused by conduction obstacles at a microscopic size scale. This study examines the influence of obstacles on the morphology of vector loops of E and whether the peak of distorted loops remains a reliable indicator for the direction of propagation. We used a computer model of a sheet of cardiac tissue with a central conduction obstacle immersed in an unbounded volume conductor. We studied the loop morphologies of E and the differences between the intracellularly determined direction of propagation, phiI(m), and the direction of E, phiE. Distortions of the vector loop were morphologically similar to those observed experimentally. Differences between phiI(m) and phiE were less than 18 degrees at all observation sites. The obstacle led to deformations of the loop morphology, particularly during the initial and terminal phases, and to a lesser degree near the instant of E. We concluded that E is a reliable indicator of phiI(m).", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2003-12-03", "authors": ["GPlank", "EVigmond", "L JLeon", "EHofer"], "doi": "10.1114/1.1615573"}

The inflammatory infiltrate in the heart includes neutrophils as well as T cells. We used anti-Ly6G antibody to transiently deplete neutrophils at the time of onset of disease. By day 7 after receiving 5 x 10(5) CD8(+) effector T cells, 100% of control Ig-treated CMy-mOva mice had died, while 85% of anti-Ly6G-treated mice survived indefinitely. CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and tissue damage were present in both groups, but the disease was limited in the anti-Ly6G-treated mice, with a rapid disappearance of the adoptively transferred CD8(+) T cells within 11 days. Recovery occurred even though blood neutrophil counts began to rise 48 hours after the last anti-Ly6G treatment. Recovery was associated with a chronic CD4(+) cell infiltrate, and a rapid decline in expression of IFN-gamma and IP-10 mRNA in the myocardium. Neutrophil depletion did not effect survival of CMy-mOva mice that received 3 x 10(6) CD8(+) T cells.

Using computer simulations, we studied the effects of altered Na(+) channel and cell coupling properties on the vulnerable window (VW) for reentry in simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue with and without dynamic instabilities. We related the VW for reentry to effects on conduction velocity, action potential duration (APD), effective refractory period dispersion and restitution, and concordant and discordant APD alternans. We found the following: 1). reduced Na(+) current density and slowed recovery promoted postrepolarization refractoriness and enhanced concordant and discordant APD alternans, which increased the VW for reentry; 2). uniformly reduced cell coupling had little effect on cellular electrophysiological properties and the VW for reentry. However, randomly reduced cell coupling combined with decoupling promoted APD dispersion and alternans, which also increased the VW for reentry; 3). the combination of decreased Na(+) channel conductance, slowed Na(+) channel recovery, and cellular uncoupling synergistically increased the VW for reentry; and 4) the VW for reentry was greater when APD restitution slope was steep than when it was flat. In summary, altered Na(+) channel and cellular coupling properties increase vulnerability to reentrant arrhythmias.

{"title": "Insulin-like growth factor-1 protects ischemic murine myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion associated injury.", "abstract": "Ischemia/reperfusion occurs in myocardial infarction, cardiac dysfunction during sepsis, cardiac transplantation and coronary artery bypass grafting, and results in injury to the myocardium. Although reperfusion injury is related to the nature and duration of ischemia, it is also a separate entity that may jeopardize viable cells and ultimately may impair cardiac performance once ischemia is resolved and the organ heals.\nThe present study was conducted in an ex vivo murine model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. After 20 min of ischemia, isolated hearts were perfused for up to 2 hours with solution (modified Kreb's) only, solution plus insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, or solution plus tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Cardiac contractility was monitored continuously during this period of reperfusion.\nOn the basis of histologic evidence, IGF-1 prevented reperfusion injury as compared with TNF-alpha; TNF-alpha increased perivascular interstitial edema and disrupted tissue lattice integrity, whereas IGF-1 maintained myocardial cellular integrity and did not increase edema. Also, there was a significant reduction in detectable creatine phosphokinase in the perfusate from IGF-1 treated hearts. By recording transduced pressures generated during the cardiac cycle, reperfusion with IGF-1 was accompanied by markedly improved cardiac performance as compared with reperfusion with TNF-alpha or modified Kreb's solution only. The histologic and functional improvement generated by IGF-1 was characterized by maintenance of the ratio of mitochondrial to nuclear DNA within heart tissue.\nWe conclude that IGF-1 protects ischemic myocardium from further reperfusion injury, and that this may involve mitochondria-dependent mechanisms.", "journal": "Critical care (London, England)", "date": "2003-11-20", "authors": ["Ehsan YDavani", "ZabrinaBrumme", "Gurpreet KSinghera", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne C FC\u00f4t\u00e9", "P RichardHarrigan", "Delbert RDorscheid"], "doi": "10.1186/cc2375\n10.1023/A:1017535509682\n10.1023/A:1017543727429\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01035-8\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705108\n10.1016/S0891-5849(03)00069-8\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01073-5\n10.1023/A:1017569611074\n10.1016/S0022-510X(97)05376-8\n10.1056/NEJMoa012035\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01033-4\n10.1073/pnas.172376399\n10.1006/phrs.1996.0120\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01022-X\n10.1016/0003-4975(96)00495-X\n10.1023/A:1006859011722\n10.1046/j.1365-201x.2001.00788.x\n10.1128/AAC.46.3.716-723.2002\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00329-2\n10.1016/S0003-4975(97)00715-7\n10.1161/hc1002.105187\n10.1038/70963\n10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80371-6\n10.1038/21218\n10.1054/ghir.2000.0143\n10.1067/mtc.2001.114101\n10.1161/01.RES.0000051885.70159.12"}

With the use of the embryoid body (EB) differentiation system, human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes at different developmental stages were isolated and their histomorphometric, ultrastructural, and proliferative properties were characterized. Histomorphometric analysis revealed an increase in cell length, area, and length-to-width ratio in late-stage EBs (>35 days) compared with early (10-21 days) and intermediate (21-35 days) stages. This was coupled with a progressive ultrastructural development from an irregular myofibrillar distribution to an organized sarcomeric pattern. Cardiomyocyte proliferation, assessed by double labeling with cardiac-specific antibodies and either [3H]thymidine incorporation or Ki-67 immunolabeling, demonstrated a gradual withdrawal from cell cycle. Hence, the percentage of positively stained nuclei in early-stage cardiomyocytes ([3H]thymidine: 60 +/- 10%, Ki-67: 54 +/- 23%) decreased to 36 +/- 7% and 9 +/- 16% in intermediate-stage EBs and to <1% in late-stage cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, a reproducible temporal pattern of early cardiomyocyte proliferation, cell-cycle withdrawal, and ultrastructural maturation was noted in this model.

This disease is called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Persistent virus in the myocardium may lead to chronic activation of fibroblasts, and subsequently, to fibrosis of the myocardium. Studies with immunodeficient mice have shown that certain defects of the immune system retard the rate at which virus is eliminated from the heart, thus leading to viral persistence. Therefore, we followed the immune response of two immunocompetent mouse strains (C57BL/6 and Balb/c) to CVB3 infection. These two strains have been reported to develop different immune responses to infections and we expected a similar reaction to viral infections as well. The two mouse strains recovered completely from CVB3 infection and expressed identical levels of cytokine mRNA in the heart. However, the virus in heart tissue decreased more slowly in Balb/c than in C57BL/6 mice. This was accompanied by a strong virus-specific IgG and weak IgM response in the C57BL/6 mice, in comparison to the Balb/c mice.

Experimental and clinical evidence indicates important functional interactions between these components. We hypothesized that there might be more direct interactions between the KvLQT1 and HERG alpha-subunits of IKs and IKr and tested this notion with a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques. Co-expression of KvLQT1 with HERG in a mammalian expression system significantly accelerated HERG current deactivation at physiologically relevant potentials by increasing the contribution of the fast component (e.g. upon repolarization from +20 mV to -50 mV: from 20 +/- 3 to 32 +/- 5%, p < 0.05), making HERG current more like native IKr. In addition, HERG current density was approximately doubled (e.g. tail current after a step to +10 mV: 18 +/- 3 versus 39 +/- 7 pA/picofarad, p < 0.01) by co-expression with KvLQT1. KvLQT1 co-expression also increased the membrane immunolocalization of HERG by approximately 2-fold (p < 0.05). HERG and KvLQT1 co-immunolocalized in canine ventricular myocytes and co-immunoprecipitated in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as in native cardiac tissue, indicating physical interactions between HERG and KvLQT1 proteins in vitro and in vivo.

{"title": "Use of cardiac electric near-field measurements to determine activation times.", "abstract": "In a recent paper, we described the behavior of the cardiac electric near-field, E, parallel to the tissue surface during continuous conduction. We found that T(E), the time at which the peak near-field, E, occurs, is an accurate marker of local activation time. Examination of experimentally recorded E vector loops revealed a large variety of morphologies. We postulated that propagation around an obstacle could lead to the observed deviations in loop morphology. The purpose of this study was to determine if this was plausible, and if so, whether T(E) remains an accurate time marker of local activation under these conditions. We used a monodomain computer model of a sheet of cardiac tissue with a central conduction obstacle immersed in an unbounded volume conductor. Activation times T(Im), T(phi), and T(E) were derived from the transmembrane current I(m), the extracellular potential phi(e), and E, respectively. The obstacle led to deformations of the vector loops, morphologically similar to those observed experimentally, particularly during the initial and terminal phases, and to a lesser degree near the time of E. Despite these loop deformations, T(E) was an accurate time marker of local activation. We found that T(E) was significantly closer to T(Im) than T(phi).

For a given electrode spacing of 60 microm, the sensitivity to noise of E was significantly less than that of phi(e).

{"title": "Atrial natriuretic hormone prohormone gene expression in cardiac and extra-cardiac tissues of diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats.", "abstract": "The present investigation was designed to determine if the mechanism for the increased atrial natriuretic peptides within the circulation of diabetic animals involves atrial natriuretic hormone prohormone (proANH) gene expression upregulation. The tissue specificity of this potential upregulation of the proANH gene was investigated in a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, i.e. the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat with comparison to age-matched non-diabetic Wistar rats from which the GK colony was originally derived. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that proANH gene expression was increased 3.1-fold in the left heart ventricle, 5-fold in lung, 2-fold in kidney, 3-fold within mucosa and 1.8-fold within muscle of gastric antrum (p < 0.05 for each) of GK rats compared to Wistar rats. There was no significant increase in proANH gene expression in atria and right ventricle of the heart of GK rats compared to Wistars. These results indicate that steady-state ANH prohormone mRNA levels increase within the left ventricle and extracardiac tissues in type 2 diabetic animals. This enhanced gene expression is a functional increase with its expressed proteins (4 peptide hormones; ANPs) increasing 2-6 fold within the circulation of GKs. The greater increase in proANH messenger RNA in the extracardiac tissues compared to the amount of increase within the heart and the greater tissue mass of these combined extra cardiac tissues suggests the majority of the increase in ANPs within the circulation of diabetics is secondary to increased synthesis in extracardiac tissues. This also suggests that there is a systemic regulatory mechanism of proANH gene expression not only within the heart but also within the lung, gastrointestinal tract and kidney. Diabetes is the first disease in which there is more upregulation of ANH prohormone in extracardiac tissues compared to upregulation within the heart itself.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2003-10-28", "authors": ["William RGower", "Gloria ISan Miguel", "Gay MCarter", "ImranHassan", "Robert VFarese", "David LVesely"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1025552029296"}

This evidence suggests that other genetic or environmental factors might concur to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy. The aim of the present study was to investigate on the possibility that other genes are involved in the pathogenesis of hamster cardiomyopathy. For this purpose, a series of genes of cardiomyopathic and healthy hamsters were compared by the differential display technique. The hamster cytochrome c oxidase mitochondrial subunit III (COIII) gene has been sequenced and identified as the gene upregulated in brain and skeletal muscle. The gene sequencing and restriction analysis demonstrated that a missense mutation is present in the COIII gene of hamsters exhibiting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy while no mutations were present in dilatative cardiomyopathic hamsters. The mutation was heteroplasmic and the heteroplasmy level was increased with age in skeletal muscle and heart. The ultrastructural analysis of cardiac tissue showed severe damage in the mitochondrial structure of hypertrophic but not dilatative hamster hearts. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of the cardiac damage in hypertrophic cardiomyopathic hamster may be sustained by multiple mutations exerting a cumulative effect on both structure and function of cardiac muscle.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2003-10-28", "authors": ["MarilenaMinieri", "MaraZingarelli", "HudaShubeita", "AlbaVecchini", "LucianoBinaglia", "FeliciaCarotenuto", "CristinaFantini", "RobertaFiaccavento", "LauraMasuelli", "AnnaColetti", "LucillaSimonelli", "AndreaModesti", "PaoloDi Nardo"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1025542731335"}
{"title": "[Free radicals mediate cardiac toxicity induced by adriamycin].", "abstract": "Anthracycline antibiotics, including adriamycin (ADM), are widely used to treat various human cancers, but their clinical use has been limited because of their cardiotoxicity. ADM is especially toxic to heart tissue. The mechanisms responsible for the cardiotoxic effect of ADM have been very/extremely controversial. This review focuses on the participation of free radicals generated by ADM in the cardiotoxic effect. ADM is reduced to a semiquinone radical species by microsomal NADPH-P450 reductase and mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. In the presence of oxygen, the reductive semiquinone radical species produces superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Generally, lipid peroxidation proceeds by mediating the redox of iron. ADM extracts iron from ferritin to form ADM-Fe3+, which causes lipid peroxidation of membranes. These events may lead to disturbance of the membrane structure and dysfunction of mitochondria. However, superoxide dismutase and hydroxyl radical scavengers have little effect on lipid peroxidation induced by ADM-Fe3+. Alternatively, ADM is oxidatively activated by peroxidases to convert to an oxidative semiquinone radical, which participates in inactivation of mitochondrial enzymes or including succinate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Here, we discuss the activation of ADM and the role of reductive and oxidative ADM semiquinone radicals in the cardiotoxic effect of this antibiotic.", "journal": "Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan", "date": "2003-10-28", "authors": ["SanaeMuraoka", "ToshiakiMiura"], "doi": "10.1248/yakushi.123.855"}

It remains uncertain whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are activated before tissue invasion by monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes, as is the case for responsible pathogenic mechanisms. Uninephrectomized rats treated for 4 weeks with dietary 1% NaCl and aldosterone (ALDOST, 0.75 microg/h) with or without spironolactone (Spi, 100 mg/kg per daily gavage) were compared with unoperated/untreated and uninephrectomized/salt-treated controls. Before intramural coronary vascular lesions appeared at week 4 of ALDOST, we found (1) a reduction of PBMC cytosolic free [Mg2+]i, together with intracellular Mg2+ and Ca2+ loading, whereas plasma and cardiac tissue Mg2+ were no different from controls; (2) increased H2O2 production by monocytes and lymphocytes together with upregulated PBMC gene expression of oxidative stress-inducible tyrosine phosphatase and Mn2+-superoxide dismutase and the presence of 3-nitrotyrosine in CD4+ and ED-1-positive inflammatory cells that had invaded intramural coronary arteries; (3) B-cell activation, including transcription of immunoglobulins, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors; (4) expansion of B lymphocyte subset and myosin heavy chain class II-expressing lymphocytes; and (5) autoreactivity with gene expression for antibodies to acetylcholine receptors and a downregulation of RT-6.2, which is in keeping with cell activation and associated with autoimmunity. Spi cotreatment attenuated the rise in intracellular Ca2+, the appearance of oxidative/nitrosative stress in PBMCs and invading inflammatory cells, and alterations in PBMC transcriptome. Thus, aldosteronism is associated with an activation of circulating immune cells induced by iterations in PBMC divalent cations and transduced by oxidative/nitrosative stress.

Simultaneously, we used an O2-selective electrode to measure the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in the perfusate, Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) solution, that was ejected from the heart. After 30 min of aerobic control perfusion, hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Under ischemic conditions, with a gradually decreasing pO2, NO detected by an NO-sensitive electrode within the myocardium was gradually increased. The maximum concentration increases in NO and decreases in pO2 during global ischemia were +10.200 +/- 1.223 microM and -58.608 +/- 4.123 mmHg, respectively. NO and pO2 levels both recovered to pre-ischemia baseline values when perfusion was restarted after global ischemia (reperfusion).

This study was designed to study the dynamics of reentry in a ring geometry of cardiac tissue culture. Reentrant calcium waves in rings of cultured embryonic chick cardiac myocytes were imaged using a macroscope to monitor the fluorescence of intracellular Calcium Green-1 dye. The rings displayed a variety of stable rhythms including pacemaker activity and spontaneous reentry. Waves originating from a localized pacemaker could lead to reentry as a consequence of unidirectional block. In addition, more complex patterns were observed due to the interactions between reentrant and pacemaker rhythms. These rhythms included instances in which pacemakers accelerated the reentrant rhythm, and instances in which the excitation was blocked in the vicinity of pacemakers. During reentrant activity an appropriately timed electrical stimulus could induce resetting of activity or cause complete annihilation of the propagating waves. This experimental preparation reveals many spontaneously occuring complex rhythms. These complex rhythms are hypothesized to reflect interactions between spontaneous pacemakers, wave propagation, refractory period, and overdrive suppression.

Mice were administered clozapine (5 and 50 mg/kg i.p.), and the extent of covalent binding was assessed by Western blotting. There was an increase in irreversible binding of clozapine to several proteins, ranging in mass from 30 to 250 kDa in both hepatic and cardiac tissue.

Metabolism of radiolabeled clozapine to a glutathionyl conjugate by liver and cardiac microsomes was 30.5 +/- 3.3 and 3.6 +/- 0.3% of the initial incubation concentration, respectively. Ketoconazole (20 muM), a P450 inhibitor, significantly reduced binding in both hepatic and cardiac microsomes to 6.2 +/- 0.2 and 0.5 +/- 0.06%, respectively.

The myocardial tissue samples were evaluated for the presence of enteroviruses and parvovirus B19 using PCR primers designed to consensus and unique sequences of these viral genomes. Enteroviruses could be detected in 14 cases of SIDS, whereas the detection of enteroviral nucleic acid within the control group was negative. Seven cases with myocardial infection caused by parvovirus B19 were found in the SIDS group. The detection of parvoviruses in the control group of the 11 children younger than 1 year was negative, whereas 3 positive cases of parvoviruses could be detected in the control group of children from 1 to 10 years old.

{"title": "Molecular markers of brain damage--clinical and ethical implications with particular focus on cardiac arrest.", "abstract": "Although 25-50% of patients suffering from cardiac arrest can be stabilised haemodynamically, the hospital discharge rate is only 2-14%. One of the major causes of this discrepancy is persistent brain damage. Studies to assess the prognostic value of early prediction of neurologic and overall outcome in patients with cardiac arrest have not yet produced precise and generally accepted diagnostic rules. As apparative diagnostic methods often fail to predict neurologic outcome, the role of molecular markers has come a focus of common interest for early outcome prediction. This systematic review article aims to give an overview on the most important molecular markers for neurologic and overall outcome prediction and outline the advantages, clinical implications and ethical issues in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation after cardiac arrest. For this purpose, the traditional marker for brain damage, the neuron-specific enolase, a gamma gamma isomer of enolase and cytoplasmatic enzyme of glycolysis, and the astroglial protein S100, a calcium-binding protein regulating neuronal differentiation, outgrowth, and apoptosis, are analysed and their role discussed as a marker for brain damage in general and recovery after cardiopulmonary resuscitation following cardiac arrest. Neuron-specific enolase has been investigated as a neuro-marker after brain damage and for outcome prediction in unconscious patients. Whereas the protein S100 has proven to be a good marker for neuronal damage after isolated brain injury, its role in cardiac surgery is not as clear: at least, in the early postoperative phase S100 is not a sole marker for neurologic damage, as release of S100 from cardiac tissue and other sources has also been demonstrated. However, the persistent elevation of S100 after cardiac surgery is specific for neurologic impairment. Most interestingly, after cardiac arrest the protein S100 has shown to be a good survival marker for overall outcome prediction. Although it cannot be absolutely determined whether cerebral or cardiac release of S100 is predominant in this clinical setting, recent studies have revealed that S100 serum levels are a useful diagnostic tool for outcome prediction. In contrast, after cardiac arrest serum levels of protein S100 did not reach a 100% specificity and sensitivity in clinical studies, and, therefore, elevated S100 in these patients has to be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, low S100 serum levels have been correlated with good outcome and, therefore, even if all other diagnostic tests indicate poor outcome, all therapeutic efforts must be undertaken, as no single study has shown that normal S100 serum levels were associated with poor prognosis.", "journal": "Restorative neurology and neuroscience", "date": "2003-10-08", "authors": ["Stephanie ASnyder-Ramos", "Bernd WB\u00f6ttiger"], "doi": null}

A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored at various intervals throughout the experiment. Infarct size was reduced to a greater extent with apstatin and with combined inhibition it was further reduced. Infarct size reduction obtained with the combined inhibition came to normal with the prior administration of B2 bradykinin antagonist HOE140 suggests the involvement of bradykinin in the cardioprotective actions of apstatin.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2003-10-07", "authors": ["K KVeeravalli", "AAkula", "K VRouthu", "M KKota"], "doi": "10.1016/s1043-6618(03)00222-6"}

The model is formulated as an infinite cylinder and takes into account the full bidomain nature of cardiac tissue, as well as fibre rotation. A detailed solution method (based on Fourier series, Fourier transforms and a one dimensional finite difference scheme) for the governing equations for electric potential in the tissue and the blood is also presented. The model presented is used to study the effect increasing subendocardial ischaemia has on the epicardial potential distribution as well as the effects of changing the bidomain conductivity values. The epicardial potential distributions obtained with this cylindrical geometry are compared with results obtained using a previously published slab model. Results of the simulations presented show that the morphologies of the epicardial potential distributions are similar between the two geometries, with the main difference being that the cylindrical model predicts slightly higher potentials.", "journal": "Mathematical biosciences", "date": "2003-10-07", "authors": ["Peter RJohnston"], "doi": "10.1016/s0025-5564(03)00099-3"}

We study numerically how the location and properties of this nonmonotonicity affect the stability of spiral waves. We find that, depending on the slopes of the ascending and of the descending parts of the restitution curve, we can have either stable rotation of the spiral wave or spiral breakup. We identify two types of spiral breakup: one due to a steep positive slope and another due to a steep negative slope in the restitution curve. We discuss the differences in their manifestation and possible implications. We also find that increasing the slope of the descending part of the restitution curve increases the meandering of the spiral wave, due to the repeated occurrence of conduction blocks near the spiral wave tip.", "journal": "Physical review.

Although the mechanisms involved in cardiomyopathy are poorly defined, a role for direct retroviral action and/or focal infiltration of activated immune cells have been postulated. Here we investigated mechanisms in retrovirus associated cardiomyopathy using a well-defined mouse model of acquired immunodeficiency.\nMice were dosed with LPBM5 retrovirus; cardiac performance was assessed by echocardiography followed by tissue collection at 5 and 10 weeks post-infection.\nContractile deficits were observed at 5 and 10 weeks post-retrovirus infection and preceded the development of overt immunodeficiency. Selective and widespread cardiac infiltration of CD68+ cells, but not neutrophils, mast cells, or eosinophils was also observed at both 5 and 10 weeks. LPBM5 retrovirus was readily detectable in cardiac samples by RT-PCR. Time dependent increases in cardiac protein nitration (biomarker of reactive nitrogen species) were observed and were correlated to the extent of cardiac dysfunction whereas no changes in NOSII occurred at 5 and 10 weeks. We corroborated the mouse findings using cardiac tissues and clinical findings from human HIV/AIDS autopsies.\nThese studies demonstrated that cardiac myocyte protein nitration in AIDS related cardiomyopathies, rather than focal immune cell lesions characterize retrovirus associated cardiomyopathies and differentiate them from non-retroviral cardiomyopathies.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2003-10-03", "authors": ["Alysia AChaves", "Michael JMihm", "Brandon LSchanbacher", "AnupamBasuray", "CynthiaLiu", "Leona WAyers", "John AnthonyBauer"], "doi": "10.1016/s0008-6363(03)00431-0"}

Exciting research over the last 2 years has changed the long held dogma that the heart cannot regenerate itself. The work of many groups can be summarized by the following concept: increasing the number of CD117+ (c-kit+) stem cells in cardiac tissue or in the coronary circulation within 2 days of a myocardial infarction results in regeneration of myocardial tissue and improved cardiac function. Animal studies by Orlic, Anversa and colleagues have demonstrated that either the direct injection of bone marrow-derived CD117+ stem cells in the infarct border zone at the time of myocardial infarction, or mobilization of these stem cells prior to myocardial infarction results in regeneration of cardiac myocytes and improved left ventricular (LV) function. In a critical experiment, Itescu and colleagues extended the window of therapeutic opportunity by demonstrating that the intravenous infusion of bone marrow-derived stem cells 2 days after myocardial infarction led to decreased infarct size, increased vascular density and improved left ventricular function.", "journal": "Discovery medicine", "date": "2003-10-01", "authors": ["Arman TAskari", "Marc SPenn"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Synthesis of voltage-sensitive fluorescence signals from three-dimensional myocardial activation patterns.", "abstract": "Voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes are commonly used to measure cardiac electrical activity. Recent studies indicate, however, that optical action potentials (OAPs) recorded from the myocardial surface originate from a widely distributed volume beneath the surface and may contain useful information regarding intramural activation. The first step toward obtaining this information is to predict OAPs from known patterns of three-dimensional (3-D) electrical activity. To achieve this goal, we developed a two-stage model in which the output of a 3-D ionic model of electrical excitation serves as the input to an optical model of light scattering and absorption inside heart tissue. The two-stage model permits unique optical signatures to be obtained for given 3-D patterns of electrical activity for direct comparison with experimental data, thus yielding information about intramural electrical activity. To illustrate applications of the model, we simulated surface fluorescence signals produced by 3-D electrical activity during epicardial and endocardial pacing. We discovered that OAP upstroke morphology was highly sensitive to the transmural component of wave front velocity and could be used to predict wave front orientation with respect to the surface. These findings demonstrate the potential of the model for obtaining useful 3-D information about intramural propagation.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2003-09-26", "authors": ["Christopher JHyatt", "Sergey FMironov", "MarcelWellner", "OmerBerenfeld", "Alois KPopp", "David AWeitz", "Jos\u00e9Jalife", "Arkady MPertsov"], "doi": "10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74690-6"}

Breast, thigh, liver and heart tissues were subjected to iron-induced lipid oxidation, the extent of which was determined by third-order derivative spectrophotometry. Results showed that dietary oregano oil at the inclusion level of 200 mg oregano oil/kg diet was more effective in delaying lipid oxidation compared with the inclusion level of 100 mg/kg, but equivalent to the inclusion of 200 mg alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet, which in turn was inferior to the combined inclusion of 100 mg oregano oil plus 100 mg alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg, which was superior to all dietary treatments. Thigh tissue was more susceptible to oxidation than breast tissue, although it contained alpha-tocopherol at higher concentrations. Also, lipid oxidation in heart was relatively high, although it contained the highest alpha-tocopherol levels. This indicates that tissue alpha-tocopherol is one important factor influencing the level of lipid oxidation, but the distribution of lipids, iron and oregano oil in tissues must also be taken into consideration. Tissue alpha-tocopherol levels responded to dietary intake of 30-200 mg alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg in the order heart > liver > thigh > breast. Breast, thigh and heart tissues from the oregano groups presented significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of alpha-tocopherol compared with the control, the increase being positively correlated with the supplementation level.

Signalling and cytoprotective mechanisms.", "abstract": "Cardiac preconditioning represents the most potent and consistently reproducible method of rescuing heart tissue from undergoing irreversible ischaemic damage. Major milestones regarding the elucidation of this phenomenon have been passed in the last two decades. The signalling and amplification cascades from the preconditioning stimulus, be it ischaemic or pharmacological, to the putative end-effectors, including the mechanisms involved in cellular protection, are discussed in this review. Volatile anaesthetics and opioids effectively elicit pharmacological preconditioning. Anaesthetic-induced preconditioning and ischaemic preconditioning share many fundamental steps, including activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, multiple protein kinases and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). Volatile anaesthetics prime the activation of the sarcolemmal and mitochondrial K(ATP) channels, the putative end-effectors of preconditioning, by stimulation of adenosine receptors and subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and by increased formation of nitric oxide and free oxygen radicals. In the case of desflurane, stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors may also be of importance. Similarly, opioids activate delta- and kappa-opioid receptors, and this also leads to PKC activation. Activated PKC acts as an amplifier of the preconditioning stimulus and stabilizes, by phosphorylation, the open state of the mitochondrial K(ATP) channel (the main end-effector in anaesthetic preconditioning) and the sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel. The opening of K(ATP) channels ultimately elicits cytoprotection by decreasing cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload.", "journal": "British journal of anaesthesia", "date": "2003-09-25", "authors": ["MZaugg", "ELucchinetti", "MUecker", "TPasch", "M CSchaub"], "doi": "10.1093/bja/aeg205"}

However, a variety of remaining discrepancies have led to a search for other subunits that might be involved in the formation of native channels. Over the past few years, a series of accessory subunits has been discovered that modify current properties upon coexpression with alpha-subunits. One of these, the minimal K(+)-channel subunit minK, is essential for formation of the cardiac slow delayed-rectifier K(+) current, I(Ks), and may also interact in functionally important ways with other alpha-subunits. Another, the K(+)-channel interacting protein KChIP appears critical in formation of native transient outward current (I(to)) channels. The roles of 2 other accessory subunits, the minK-related peptide MiRP and the K(+)-channel accessory protein, KChAP, remain unclear. This article reviews the available knowledge regarding the accessory subunits minK, MiRP, KChIP and KChAP, dealing with their structure, effects on currents carried by coexpressed alpha-subunits, expression in cardiac tissues and potential physiological function.

In the present study, we compared the results of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy planning for five patients irradiated in the supine and prone position. Tumor stage was T1N0M0 in four patients and T1N1M0 in one. All patients had been previously submitted to conservative breast surgery. Breast size was large in three patients and moderate in the other two. Irradiation in the prone position was performed using an immobilization foam pad with a hole cut into it to accommodate the breast so that it would hang down away from the chest wall. Dose-volume histograms showed that mean irradiation doses reaching the ipsilateral lung were 8.3+/-3.6 Gy with the patient in the supine position and 1.4+/-1.0 Gy with the patient in the prone position (P = 0.043). The values for the contralateral lung were 1.3+/-0.7 and 0.3+/-0.1 Gy (P = 0.043) and the values for cardiac tissue were 4.6+/-1.6 and 3.0+/-1.7 Gy (P = 0.079), respectively. Thus, the dose-volume histograms demonstrated that lung tissue irradiation was significantly lower with the patient in the prone position than in the supine position. Large-breasted women appeared to benefit most from irradiation in the prone position. Prone position breast irradiation appears to be a simple and effective alternative to the conventional supine position for patients with large breasts, since they are subjected to lower pulmonary doses which may cause less pulmonary side effects in the future.", "journal": "Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas", "date": "2003-09-23", "authors": ["CKurtman", "MNal\u00e7a Andrieu", "AHi\u00e7s\u00f6nmez", "BCelebio\u011flu"], "doi": "10.1590/s0100-879x2003001000023"}

The mechanism by which CARP expression is regulated and the consequences of CARP overexpression on cardiac contractility are unknown.\nCompared to vehicle treated controls, 4-day treatment of male Wistar rats with the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (2.4 mg/kg per day) induced hypertrophy and significantly increased CARP mRNA and CARP protein levels in left ventricles. The signalling pathways were investigated in more detail in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Treatment of cells with isoprenaline (1 micromol/l) caused a significant increase in CARP mRNA and protein by approximately 50%. Combined beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA; Rp-cAMPS, 100 micromol/l), and inhibition of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK; KN-62, 10 micromol/l) completely reversed the effects of isoprenaline. To examine the consequences of CARP overexpression on contractile function, an adenovirus encoding human CARP as well as a control virus were constructed. Although the basal force of contraction was not different, contractile response to Ca(2+) and isoprenaline was significantly diminished in engineered heart tissue infected with the recombinant adenovirus that carries the CARP gene (Ad.CARP).\nOur study provides the first evidence that overexpression of CARP, which is thought to act as a transcriptional co-repressor, may deteriorate contractile function of the heart tissue.

Cardiac mechanics changes were evaluated together with biochemical markers of cardiac ischemia in perfusate and tissue tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). CHF-1024, perfused through the heart for 15 min before ischemia at different molar concentrations (1-100 nM), significantly improved left ventricle developed pressure during reperfusion, and normalized left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and coronary perfusion pressure.

No significant difference was detected between organs in the number or time of first occurrence of positive result. Virus culture identified a total of 14% of pre-clinical fish as ISAV-infected. The presence of ISAV in heart tissue was particularly notable (13% of fish sampled) as was the inability to culture virus from spleen tissue. In the case of IFAT, 15% of fish sampled were positive, although tissue other than kidney proved unsuitable for use in this method. Only limited ISAV-specific pathology was detectable by histological examination of fish prior to the onset of clinical disease.

In this report insulin and AngII signaling, through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and MAPK pathways, were compared in cardiac tissues of control and obese Zucker rats. AngII induced Janus kinase 2 tyrosine phosphorylation and coimmunoprecipitation with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 as well as an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS and its association with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2. Simultaneous treatment with both hormones led to marked increases in the associations of IRS-1 and -2 with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 and in the dual phosphorylation of ERK1/2 compared with the administration of AngII or insulin alone. In contrast, an acute inhibition of both basal and insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity was induced by both hormones. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of MAPK equally in lean and obese rats. Conversely, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt in heart was decreased in obese rats. Pretreatment with losartan did not change insulin-induced activation of ERK1/2 and attenuated the reduction of Akt phosphorylation in the heart of obese rats. Thus, the imbalance between PI 3-kinase-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in the heart may play a role in the development of cardiovascular abnormalities observed in insulin-resistant states, such as in obese Zucker rats.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2003-09-10", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 B CCarvalheira", "Vivian CCalegari", "Henrique GZecchin", "WilsonNadruz", "Regina BGuimar\u00e3es", "Eliane BRibeiro", "Kleber GFranchini", "L\u00edcio AVelloso", "Mario J ASaad"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2003-0788"}

Both genes were separated by only 393 bp containing a CpG island with numerous binding sites for Sp1. A TATA box, however, was lacking. Northern blot analysis revealed that both genes were expressed differently, indicating that their expression was regulated independently. We have analysed the promoter activity of the small genomic fragment separating the Pxmp2 and PoleI genes using luciferase as a reporter molecule in transient transfection assays. The small genomic fragment was a functional promoter, controlling gene expression regardless of its orientation. Promoter activity was 60-70% compared with the activity of the strong CMV promoter. The Pxmp2 and PoleI genes were also linked on the human and rat genome. Furthermore, the sequence of the intergenic fragment was highly conserved among these species.

It is important to understand the potential contractile capability within the TM and possible changes associated with spontaneous hypertensive glaucoma. To that end we have examined the presence of actin, including smooth muscle (SM) actin, in the normal and glaucomatous canine iridocorneal angle (ICA) morphologically and immunohistochemically.\nSections from the ICAs of 12 Beagles with inherited glaucoma (3 months to 6 years old) and age-matched normal Beagles were treated with target retrieval, protein and power blocked and sequentially incubated with the primary antibody (rat anticanine SM actin) and the secondary antibody (rabbit antirat immunoglobulin), followed by peroxidase labeled streptavidin and incubation with substrate-chromogen solution (AEC). Smooth muscle fibers that lined an artery within canine heart tissue were used as positive controls. Separate specimens were prepared for ultrastructual observation.\nUltrastructurally, cells within the inner, posterior region of the corneoscleral TM and outer, posterior region of the uveal TM contained many microfilaments, 6 nm in diameter (i.e. actin). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that cells within these regions possessed SM actin, having been greatest posteriorly, but extended anteriorly to a lesser extent. In the preglaucomatous affected dog the localization pattern for SM actin was identical to that seen in the normal dogs. With the progression of the disease the pattern disappeared.\nThe interior presence of myofibroblastic cells within the canine ICA suggests that these cells and the smooth muscle cells of the ciliary body along the same plane of orientation function to facilitate the removal of aqueous humor and are likely to be influenced by vascular mediators.

Mobilization was carried out with stem cell factor, 25 mcg/Kg/d (D), and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, 100 mcg/Kg/D administered 5 days before (D - 5 group; n = 3) or 4 hours after (H + 4 group; n = 4) circumflex coronary artery ligation; no growth factor was administered to 3 baboons of the control group. No adverse effect relating to growth factor administration was observed. Flk-1 and transcription factors of cardiac lineages could be detected in peripheral blood only by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. When comparing positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]-acetate between examinations from D2 and D30, a relative increase (perfusion ratio between infarct and noninfarct regions) of 26% (P =.01) in myocardial blood flow was found in the H + 4 group; the relative rate of oxidative metabolism remained unaltered in the 3 groups. No change was observed in the echographic indices of the left ventricular enlargement or systolic function in the 3 animal groups during the 2-month follow-up. The PET findings concurred with the immunohistochemistry analysis of left ventricular myocardial sections with evidence of endothelial cells but no myocyte differentiation; few cycling cells were observed at this time.

{"title": "Regulation of connexin43 gap junctional conductance by ventricular action potentials.", "abstract": "Transjunctional voltage regulates cardiac gap junctional conductance, but the kinetics of inactivation were considered too slow to affect cardiac action potential propagation. Connexin43 (Cx43) is abundantly expressed in the atrial and ventricular myocardium and the rapid ventricular conduction tissues (ie, His-Purkinje system) of the mammalian heart and is important to conduction through these cardiac tissues. The kinetics of Cx43 voltage gating were examined at peak action potential voltages using simulated ventricular myocardial action potential waveforms or pulse protocols exceeding 100-mV transjunctional potentials. Junctional current responses approximate the action potential morphology but conductance calculations reveal a 50% to 60% decline from peak to near constant plateau values. Junctional conductance recovers during phase 3 repolarization and early diastole to initial values. The bases for these transient changes in junctional conductance are the rapid decay kinetics in tens of milliseconds at peak transjunctional voltages (Vj) of 130 mV and the gradual increase in junctional conductance as Vj returns toward 0 mV. The decay time constants change e-fold per 22.1 mV above the half-inactivation voltage for Cx43 gap junctions of +/-58 mV. A realistic dynamic model for changes in junctional resistance between excitable and nonexcitable cells during cardiac action potential propagation was developed based on these findings. This dynamic model of cardiac gap junctions will further our understanding of the role gap junctions play in the genesis and propagation of cardiac arrhythmias.

The rats were categorized into four groups, receiving: 0.9% NaCl i.p. (NaCl control); melatonin [20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)] s.c. (control Mel); DOX (2.5 mg/kg b.w.) i.p.; melatonin plus DOX in doses as above. All the substances were administered once in a week for four consecutive weeks. Homogenates of heart tissue were examined for activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and of lipid peroxidation indices (MDA + 4-HDA). Administration of melatonin alone did not induce alterations in levels of MDA + 4-HDA, GSH, or in activity of GPx, SOD or CAT, as compared to the group receiving 0.9% NaCl. GSH levels decreased following DOX but remained at normal levels following DOX and melatonin. The level of MDA + 4-HDA increased following DOX, as compared with the control, a change prevented by the combination of DOX + melatonin. Activities of GPx, SOD and CAT were higher in groups receiving DOX and/or DOX plus melatonin than in control groups. Activity of CAT and the level of GSH in the group receiving DOX plus melatonin were significantly higher than in the group intoxicated with DOX alone. The obtained results demonstrate that, when given in parallel with DOX, melatonin protects cardiomyocytes from damaging effects of the cytostatic drug (reflected by the levels of MDA + 4-HDA). The protective effect resulted, in part from the augmented levels of GSH and from stimulation of CAT activity by melatonin in cardiomyocytes subjected to the action of DOX.", "journal": "Journal of pineal research", "date": "2003-08-23", "authors": ["PiotrDziegiel", "EugeniaMurawska-Cia\u0142owicz", "ZbigniewJethon", "LidiaJanuszewska", "MarzenaPodhorska-Oko\u0142\u00f3w", "Pawe\u0142Surowiak", "MarcinZawadzki", "JerzyRabczy\u0144ski", "MaciejZabel"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1600-079x.2003.00079.x"}

Furthermore, coculture experiments with adult mouse BM cells and embryonic heart tissue confirmed that HPCs are able to both integrate into cardiac tissue and differentiate into cardiomyocytes. In an additional set of experiments, we investigated whether other hematopoietic populations might possess cardiac potential by examining whether blood cells that normally are recruited to damaged tissue might act as a source of newly generated cardiomyocytes.

Because eggs are shed from the adult prior to fertilization, all stages of embryo development are readily accessible. Furthermore, until swimming tadpole stages, development occurs without growth, using nutrients stored in each cell. These features have three significant experimental consequences: all stages of heart development are readily accessible, explants of embryonic tissue will continue to differentiate in simple salts solution, and the function of individual gene products can be studied by microinjection into embryonic cells. Additionally, because heart function is entirely unnecessary until tadpoles begin feeding, even treatments that cause severe disruption of cardiogenesis are readily amenable to study.

However, expression of these genes in the failing heart has not yet been investigated. This study was designed to elaborate a molecular profile of myocardin and HOP expression in the failing ventricular myocardium through the use of both explanted human heart samples and heart biopsies from neonatal piglets with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (Dox-CM). Myocardin and HOP mRNA levels were estimated by both northern blot hybridization and semiquantitative RT-PCR in human ventricular preparations in end-stage failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), as well as in nonfailing donor hearts. Similar experiments were performed with ventricular samples from normal and Dox-treated neonatal piglets. The gene expression of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was used as a molecular marker of myocardial damage and failure. The study revealed the following novel findings: (1) myocardin transcripts are detected in neonatal human and pig hearts at lower levels than in mature cardiac tissues, (2) the myocardin transcript pool is significantly augmented in the failing human and porcine myocardium as compared to that in nonfailing heart samples, (3) in the failing human myocardium, increased levels of myocardin mRNA are associated with a diminished HOP transcript content, and (4) the inverse proportion in cardiac myocardin/HOP mRNA pools observed in explanted human hearts is also traceable in normal human heart and aorta. A possible dual consequence of increased myocardin and decreased HOP expression levels on serum response factor-dependent cardiac-specific expression in the normal heart and at heart failure is discussed. Therefore, increased abundance of the myocardin mRNA pool is judged to be a novel CM-related feature which, alone or in association with decreased HOP transcript levels, can be responsible for dysregulation of myocardin-mediated gene expression in failing myocardium.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2003-08-16", "authors": ["MarioTorrado", "EduardoL\u00f3pez", "AlbertoCenteno", "ConstancioMedrano", "AlfonsoCastro-Beiras", "Alexander TMikhailov"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-003-0470-7"}

In addition, the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine in the perfusion medium totally blocked NO production but did not reverse the protective effects of LPS.

The cell-collagen complex was transferred into rotary cell culture system (RCCS) and incubated for 7 days. Cells cultured in 75 ml flasks and constructs cultures on plates served as control. Morphological changes of the cells were observed by light microscope and metabolic rate was recorded.

H-E and anti-sarcomeric alpha-actin stains were performed in comparison with native cardiac muscle.\nThe isolated cardiac muscle cells adhered to the bottom of the flasks 24 hours after plating and began to beat spontaneously. When incubated for 7 days in RCCS, cell-collagen constructs of form a continuous outer tissue layer containing cells aligned with each other. The cell population in the interior of the construct was less in density than the outer part. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that subcellular elements characteristic of cardiac myocytes were in the outermost layer of constructs. A strongly positive stains of anti-sarcomeric alpha-actin suggested presence of cell population of differentiated cardiac myocytes in these constructs. Construct biomass was not significantly different from that in neonatal rat ventricle and approximately 40% of that in adult rat ventricles. Construsts in plates contained a few of cells which were less than those in RCCS.

Lipid peroxidation increases under stress conditions such as hypoxia, ischemia or acidosis as well as in metabolic diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus. We have shown that subcomatous doses of insulin (6.0 IU/kg) significantly increase thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs), especially malondialdehyde (MDA) - the endproduct of lipid peroxidation, in the brain and heart of mice. In our model of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, mice were treated with the neuroprotective, peptide-containing drug Cerebrolysin (100 mg/kg b.w.). Animals were sacrificed by decapitation two or three hours after the injection of tested substance and samples were taken to determine several serum parameters (glucose, total protein, triglycerides and lactic acid) and TBARs in the brain and heart. Although Cerebrolysin was not able to affect serum parameters after subcomatous insulin injection, the drug significantly influenced lipid peroxidation. A single injection of Cerebrolysin already decreased TBARs levels in the brain and heart tissue.

Anesthetized, ovariectomized rabbits were administered 17beta-estradiol (20 microg), 17alpha-estradiol (1 mg), or vehicle intravenously 30 min before a 30-min occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery followed by 4 h of reperfusion.

{"title": "Coupling of cardiac electrical activity over extended distances by fibroblasts of cardiac origin.", "abstract": "Roughly half of the cells of the heart consist of nonmyocardial cells, with fibroblasts representing the predominant cell type. It is well established that individual cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in culture establish gap junctional communication at the single cell level (short-range interaction). However, it is not known whether such coupling permits activation of cardiac tissue over extended distances (long-range interaction). Long-range interactions may be responsible for electrical synchronization of donor and recipient tissue after heart transplantation and may play a role in arrhythmogenesis. This question was investigated using a novel heterocellular culture model with strands of cardiomyocytes interrupted by cardiac fibroblasts over defined distances. With use of optical recording techniques, it could be shown that impulse propagation along fibroblast inserts was successful over distances up to 300 microm and was characterized by length-dependent local propagation delays ranging from 11 to 68 ms (apparent local \"conduction velocities\" 4.6+/-1.8 mm/s, n=23). Involvement of mechanical stretch in this phenomenon was excluded by showing that inserts consisting of communication-deficient HeLa cells were incapable of supporting propagation. In contrast, HeLa cells expressing connexin43 permitted impulse conduction over distances as long as 600 microm. Immunocytochemistry showed that fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes expressed connexin43 and connexin45, whereas connexin40 was absent. These results illustrate that fibroblasts of cardiac origin are capable of synchronizing electrical activity of multicellular cardiac tissue over extended distances through electrotonic interactions. This synchronization is accompanied by extremely large local conduction delays, which might contribute to the generation of arrhythmias in fibrotic hearts.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2003-08-02", "authors": ["GiedriusGaudesius", "MicheleMiragoli", "Stuart PThomas", "StephanRohr"], "doi": "10.1161/01.RES.0000089258.40661.0C"}

Between 470 and 700 nm, only the reduced scattering coefficient and absorption could be evaluated. The absorption spectra were fitted to known tissue chromophore spectra, so that the concentrations of haemoglobin and myoglobin could be estimated. The reduced scattering coefficient was compared with Mie computations to provide Mie equivalent average radii. Most of the absorption was from myoglobin, whereas haemoglobin absorption was negligible. Metmyoglobin was formed in the ablated tissue, which could yield a spectral signature to distinguish the ablated tissue with a simple optical probe to monitor the ablation therapy.

Parasite-released antigens also modulate ECM expression that could participate in cell-cell and/or cell-parasite interactions. Increased expression of ECM components has been described in the cardiac tissue of chronic chagasic patients and diverse target tissues including heart, thymus, central nervous system and skeletal muscle of experimentally T. cruzi-infected mice. ECM components may adsorb parasite antigens and cytokines that could contribute to the establishment and perpetuation of inflammation. Furthermore, T. cruzi-infected mammalian cells produce cytokines and chemokines that not only participate in the control of parasitism but also contribute to the establishment of chronic inflammatory lesions in several target tissues and most frequently lead to severe myocarditis. T. cruzi-driven cytokines and chemokines may also modulate VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules on endothelial cells of target tissues and play a key role in cell recruitment, especially of activated VLA-4+LFA-1+CD8+ T lymphocytes, resulting in a predominance of this cell population in the inflamed heart, central nervous system and skeletal muscle. The VLA-4+-invading cells are surrounded by a fine network of fibronectin that could contribute to cell anchorage, activation and effector functions.

MMP inhibition caused a regression in the myocyte hypertrophy in association with the suppression of both IGF-I protein in myocytes and the degradation of IGFBP-3 protein.

In this review, we present an up-to-date summary of the research in cardiac tissue engineering, with an emphasis on the design principles and selection criteria that have been used in two key technologies employed in tissue engineering, (1) biomaterials technology, for the creation of 3-D porous scaffolds which are used to support and guide the tissue formation from dissociated cells, and (2) bioreactor cultivation of the 3-D cell constructs during ex-vivo tissue engineering, which aims to duplicate the normal stresses and flows experienced by the tissues.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2003-07-25", "authors": ["MichalShachar", "SmadarCohen"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1024729919743"}
{"title": "Cardiac tissue engineering for replacement therapy.", "abstract": "Cell therapy is a new concept to repair diseased organs. For patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure, and congenital heart diseases cell based therapies might represent a potential cure. The field can be subdivided into two principally different approaches: (1) Implantation of isolated cells and (2) implantation of in vitro engineered tissue constructs. This review will focus on the latter approach. Cardiac tissue engineering comprises the fields of material sciences and cell biology. In general, scaffold materials such as gelatin, collagen, alginate, or synthetic polymers and cardiac cells are utilized to reconstitute tissue-like constructs in vitro. Ideally, these constructs display properties of native myocardium such as coherent contractions, low diastolic tension, and syncytial propagation of action potentials. To be applicable for surgical repair of diseased myocardium engineered tissue constructs should have the propensity to integrate and remain contractile in vivo. Size and mechanical properties of engineered constructs are critical for surgical repair of large tissue defects. Successful application of tissue engineering in men will depend on the utilization of an autologous or non-immunogeneic cell source and scaffold material to avoid life long immunosuppression. This review will give an overview of recent approaches in cardiac tissue engineering and its first applications in vivo. We will discuss materials and cell sources for cardiac tissue engineering. Further, principle obstacles will be addressed. Cardiac tissue engineering for replacement therapy has an intriguing perspective, but is in its early days.

Therapeutic and preventive trials for FAP at the plasma TTR level require a careful study of the destabilization of TTR under variable conditions. We have developed a simple double one-dimensional (D1-D) electrophoretic procedure with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) gradient PAGE to study the dimer to monomer transition. TTR is first isolated by PAGE from other plasma proteins. The gel strip containing the TTR fraction is incubated in 2% SDS under varying conditions of temperature, buffer composition, pH, and additives like urea and/or a sulfhydryl-reactive agent, followed by SDS-gradient PAGE for the separation of TTR dimers and monomers. We demonstrate that an unidirectional dimer to monomer transition of normal TTR is achieved at 70-80 degrees C in neutral to mild alkaline buffers or at 37 degrees C and slightly acidic pH (6-7). Addition of urea favors the transition into monomers. Amyloidogenic mutations like amyloidogenic TTR (ATTR)-V30M or ATTR-I107V favor the transition into monomers in buffer systems close to the physiological pH of human plasma. We conclude that this finding has to be considered by any hypothesis on ATTR-derived amyloidogenesis.", "journal": "Electrophoresis", "date": "2003-07-23", "authors": ["KlausAltland", "PiaWinter"], "doi": "10.1002/elps.200305464"}

Tibiotarsal joint, ear, and heart tissues were monitored for spirochete numbers at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postinoculation with 10(5) B. burgdorferi B31 clone 5A4 by using quantitative real-time PCR. The spirochete load in joint and ear tissue remained higher in the C3(-/-) mice than in the wild-type counterparts throughout the 12-week study, whereas the numbers in heart tissue of both groups of mice decreased substantially at 8 to 12 weeks postinfection. Histopathology scores for joint tissue were generally higher in the C3(-/-) mice compared to C57BL/6 controls at 2 and 4 weeks postinfection, which may reflect the presence of higher numbers of bacteria in the joints at these early time points. Levels of anti-B. burgdorferi immunoglobulin G tended to be reduced in the C3(-/-) mice compared to control mice. Furthermore, a 5.5-fold-lower number of the complement-sensitive Borrelia garinii was needed to infect C3(-/-) mice compared to C57BL/6 mice, indicating that its sensitivity to complement is one barrier to infection of the mouse model by B. garinii.

The ET-1 (100 nM)-induced positive inotropy was accompanied by an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) transients without any change in the [Ca(2+)](i)-force relationship. Ryanodine (1 microM) partially decreased the [Ca(2+)](i) transients and contractile force, but did not affect the ET-1 (100 nM)-induced positive inotropy. Reduction of [Na(+)](o) elicited an increase in contractile force, and this effect was significantly inhibited by KB-R7943 (30 microM), an inhibitor of the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger. KB-R7943 (30 microM) almost completely suppressed the positive inotropic effect of ET-1. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol 12,13-dibutylate (100 nM) decreased the contractile force, an effect which was suppressed by bisindolylmaleimide I (3 microM). On the other hand, the ET-1-induced positive inotropic effect was unaffected by bisindolylmaleimide I (3 microM). These results suggest that the positive inotropic effect of ET-1 in neonatal mouse right ventricles is caused by the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) transients through activation of the endothelin ET(A) receptor and the increase in Ca(2+) influx via the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger during an action potential.

In recent years, statins have become the major choice of treatment for hypercholesterolemia. Emerging evidence from both animal and human studies indicates that mechanisms independent of cholesterol lowering effects contribute to the observed clinical benefits of statins. The anti-hypertrophy effect of statins on the cardiac tissue represents one of such mechanisms. The beneficial effects of statins on cardiac hypertrophy and cardioprotection may be attributed to their functional influences on small G proteins such as Ras and Rho, resulting in an increase of endogenous nitric oxide (NO), reduction of oxidative stress, inhibition of inflammatory reaction, and decrease of the renin-angiotensin system activity as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in cardiac tissues. Recent findings from in vitro and in vivo studies of statins on cardioprotective effects are summarized in this review.

{"title": "Use of the transgenic mouse in models of AIDS cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Heart disease in AIDS, particularly cardiomyopathy (CM), is an increasingly recognized clinical problem with as yet undefined pathogenetic mechanisms. Among the potential etiologies of AIDS CM are HIV-1 infection of cardiac myocytes and subsequent cardiac dysfunction, opportunistic infection, inflammatory reactions, cytokine effects, and cardiotoxicity of prescribed or illicit drugs. It seems probable that multiple factors may impact on the development of CM in AIDS. Transgenic mice (TG) are useful biological tools to explore mechanisms of cardiac function and disease. In AIDS models, TG offer novel ways to elucidate mechanisms of AIDS CM through combined in vivo and in vitro studies. With targeted and non-targeted TG, structural and functional effects of specific HIV-1 gene products on heart tissue may be addressed. The impact of environmental agents including therapeutics or cardiotoxins may also be defined. To address the complexity of AIDS CM using TG, an experimental approach has been employed in our laboratories to model the clinical condition. We utilize AIDS TG with generalized expression of HIV-1 gene products in CM models with combined antiretroviral regimens to define the cardiovascular effects of AIDS and its therapy on the structure and function of the murine heart. We are developing a series of cardiac specific TG bearing selected HIV-1 genes. These TG target the selected HIV-1 genes expressed in cardiac ventricular myocytes.

{"title": "Myocardial oxygenation in isolated hearts predicted by an anatomically realistic microvascular transport model.", "abstract": "An anatomically realistic model for oxygen transport in cardiac tissue is introduced for analyzing data measured from isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. The model is constructed to match the microvascular anatomy of cardiac tissue based on available morphometric data. Transport in the three-dimensional system (divided into distinct microvascular, interstitial, and parenchymal spaces) is simulated. The model is used to interpret experimental data on mean cardiac tissue myoglobin saturation and to reveal differences in tissue oxygenation between buffer-perfused and red blood cell-perfused isolated hearts. Interpretation of measured mean myoglobin saturation is strongly dependent on the oxygen content of the perfusate (e.g., red blood cell-containing vs. cell-free perfusate). Model calculations match experimental values of mean tissue myoglobin saturation, measured mean myoglobin, and venous oxygen tension and can be used to predict distributions of intracellular oxygen tension. Calculations reveal that approximately 20% of the tissue is hypoxic with an oxygen tension of <0.5 mmHg when the buffer is equilibrated with 95% oxygen to give an arterial oxygen tension of over 600 mmHg. The addition of red blood cells to give a hematocrit of only 5% prevents tissue hypoxia.

Lesions appear at week 4 of treatment with ALDO and 1% dietary NaCl in uninephrectomized rats (ALDOST) and include invading monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes with intracellular evidence of oxidative and nitrosative stress, myofibroblasts, and perivascular fibrosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an immunostimulatory state with activated circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) precedes this proinflammatory and profibrogenic cardiac phenotype and is initiated by reduction in the cytosolic free Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i). At 1 and 4 wk of ALDOST (preclinical and clinical stages, respectively), we monitored serum Mg2+, PBMC [Mg2+]i and cytosolic free [Ca2+] (via fluorimetry), and expressed genes (via microchip array) as well as markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress in plasma [alpha1-antiproteinase activity (alpha1-AP)] and cardiac tissue (immunohistochemical detection of gp91phox subunit of NADPH oxidase and 3-nitrotyrosine). Age- and gender-matched unoperated and untreated (UO) rats and uninephrectomized salt-treated (UN) rats served as controls. Serum [Mg2+] was unchanged by ALDOST. In contrast with UO and UN, [Mg2+]i and plasma alpha1-AP were each reduced (P < 0.05) at weeks 1 and 4. The decline in PBMC [Mg2+]i was accompanied by Ca2+ loading. Differential (twofold and higher) expression (up- and downregulation) in PBMC transcriptomes was present at week 1 and progressed at week 4. Involved were genes for the alpha1-isoform of Na+-K+-ATPase, the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump, antioxidant reserves, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and PBMC activation with autoimmune responses. Expression of 3-nitrotyrosine and activation of gp91phox were seen in inflammatory cells that invaded intramural arteries.

The lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions characterized by tissue inflammation. In the present study, we aimed at evaluating the role of PAF during T. cruzi infection by using mice that were genetically deficient in the PAF receptor. We observed that infected hearts of PAFR(-/-) mice had an increased number of parasite nests, associated with a more intense inflammatory infiltrate. This was associated with greater parasitemia and lethality. When wild-type and PAFR(-/-) mice were compared, there were no marked changes in the kinetics of the expression of MCP-1, RANTES, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in heart tissue of infected animals. Moreover, serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, nitrate and parasite-specific IgM were similar in both groups of mice. In vitro, macrophages from PAFR(-/-) animals did not phagocytose trypomastigote forms when activated with PAF, leukotriene B(4) or MCP-1 and produced less nitric oxide when infected and activated with IFN-gamma.

{"title": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases: a new therapeutic target in cardiac pathology.", "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells respond to different external stimuli by activation of mechanisms of cell signaling. One of the major systems participating in the transduction of signal from the cell membrane to nuclear and other intracellular targets is the highly conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily. The members of MAPK family are involved in the regulation of a large variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, development, cell cycle, death and survival. Several MAPK subfamilies, each with apparently unique signaling pathway, have been identified in the mammalian myocardium. These cascades differ in their upstream activation sequence and in downstream substrate specifity. Each pathway follows the same conserved three-kinase module consisting of MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK, MKK or MEK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK, MEKK). The major groups of MAPKs found in cardiac tissue include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the stress-activated/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNKs), p38-MAPK, and ERK5/big MAPK 1 (BMK1). The ERKs are strongly activated by mitogenic and growth factors and by physical stress, whereas SAPK/JNKs and p38-MAPK can be activated by various cell stresses, such as hyperosmotic shock, metabolic stress or protein synthesis inhibitors, UV radiation, heat shock, cytokines, and ischemia. Activation of MAPKs family plays a key role in the pathogenesis of various processes in the heart, e.g. myocardial hypertrophy and its transition to heart failure, in ischemic and reperfusion injury, as well in the cardioprotection conferred by ischemia- or pharmacologically-induced preconditioning. The following approaches are currently utilized to elucidate the role of MAPKs in the myocardium: (i) studies of the effects of myocardial processes on the activity of these kinases; (ii) pharmacological modulations of MAPKs activity and evaluation of their impact on the (patho)physiological processes in the heart; (iii) gene targeting or expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of enzymes (adenovirus-mediated gene transfer). This review is focused on the regulatory role of MAPKs in the myocardium, with particular regard to their involvement in pathophysiological processes, such as myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure, ischemia/reperfusion injury, as well as in the mechanisms of cardioprotection.

Dorsoanterior endoderm is thought to provide a signal that induces adjacent mesodermal cells to adopt a cardiac fate. However, the nature of this signalling and the precise role of endoderm are unknown because of the close proximity and interdependence of mesoderm and endoderm during gastrulation. To better define the molecular events that underlie cardiac induction, we have sought to develop a simple means of inducing cardiac tissue. We show that the transcription factor GATA4, which has been implicated in regulating cardiac gene expression, is sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation in Xenopus embryonic ectoderm (animal pole) explants, frequently resulting in beating tissue. Lineage labelling experiments demonstrate that GATA4 can trigger cardiac differentiation not only in cells in which it is present, but also in neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, cardiac differentiation can occur without any stable differentiation of anterior endoderm and is in fact enhanced under conditions in which endoderm formation is inhibited. Remarkably, cardiac tissue is formed even when GATA4 activity is delayed until long after explants have commenced differentiation into epidermal tissue. These findings provide a simple assay system for cardiac induction that may allow elucidation of pathways leading to cardiac differentiation. Better knowledge of the pathways governing this process may help develop procedures for efficient generation of cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2003-07-02", "authors": ["Branko VLatinki\u0107", "SurendraKotecha", "Timothy JMohun"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.00599"}

Resection did not affect refractory periods. Five hearts were subjected to histology. Complete atrial echoes were induced in 1 heart, incomplete atrial echoes in 5 hearts. Unidirectional conduction block occurred at the atrial-transitional cell junction in the superior area. Zones of slow conduction arose at the atrial-transitional or the transitional-compact node junction in the inferior area. Complete reentrant circuits of ventricular echoes were obtained in 5 hearts. Unidirectional conduction block occurred at the compact node-transitional cell junction in the superior area. Localized zones of slow conduction arose at the junctions between the different types of tissue in the inferior area.\nIn the dog heart, tissue architecture and functional dissociation between the inferior and the superior region of the AV node enable dual physiology and reentry.

Determination of these cardiac marker enzymes permits a highly sensitive diagnosis of transmural myocardial infarction. In such patients the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction can be confirmed by the clinical, symptoms, and changes in the ECG in addition to the enzyme assays. The 50 AMI patients selected in the present study were those admitted to the ICCU of Shri Krishna Hospital, Karamsad. The blood samples were taken at the time of admission (ie. within four hours of the start of chest pain). The samples were analyzed for CK, CKMB, SGOT, (Serum glutamate oxaloactate transaminase) \u03b1HBDH \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and troponin T. The serum CKMB activity in AMI showed an increase only 5-6 hours after the commencement of chest pain. The elevation in SGOT and \u03b1HBDH was still delayed. At the same time we could observe that the cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) was elevated at the time of admission of the patient itself. This increase of cTnT in AMI patients was 20 times higher than the normal blood donors. The controls included 25 normal blood donors and 25 patients with polytraumatic injuries with no chest contusion. The study shows that cTnT estimation could serve in the early diagnosis of AMI. The increase of cardiac troponin T in AMI patients was 20 times higher than the normal blood donors in AMI patients at the time of admission. Cardiac troponin T in serum appears to be a more sensitive indicator of myocardial cell injury than CKMB activity and its detection in the circulation may be a useful prognostic indicator in patients with unstable angina as well. When the blood of normal blood donors or that of patients with polytraumatic injury was analysed the troponin T values were well within the normal range in both the above categories showing that cardiac troponin T is highly specific for heart tissue. Although CKMB and cardiac troponin T are released soon after the myocardial injury, the release of cardiac troponin T is much earlier than CKMB thereby invalidating the important role of cardiac troponin T in diagnosing AMI. Cardiac troponin T has been shown to be highly sensitive for cardiac injury and not elevated in any other trauma, heavy exercise or skeletal muscle injury. Cardiac troponin T is ordinarily undetectable in healthy individuals, and so its measurement can serve as a powerful tool in the diagnosis of AMI.", "journal": "Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB", "date": "2003-07-01", "authors": ["HiteshShah", "NHaridas"], "doi": "10.1007/BF02867373\n10.1016/0009-8981(76)90146-7\n10.1136/hrt.71.3.242\n10.1016/0002-8703(83)90524-0\n10.1378/chest.71.4.486\n10.1016/0002-9149(83)90508-8\n10.1016/0002-8703(83)90489-1\n10.1056/NEJM199207163270302\n10.1016/0140-6736(93)90621-M\n10.1016/0140-6736(93)92996-7\n10.1001/archinte.140.3.329\n10.1136/hrt.43.5.514\n10.1016/0002-9343(81)90126-1"}

IL-18 has proinflammatory properties, induces cell death and stimulates nitric oxide production. We hypothesized that following myocardial infarction (MI) an increased myocardial IL-18 production occurs, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of post-ischemic heart failure.\nSeven days after induction of MI in the mouse, myocardial hypertrophy and pulmonary edema were observed. RNase protection assay of tissue from the non-infarcted left ventricular myocardium revealed an increase in IL-18 (2.0-fold; P<0.001) and IL-1 beta (1.6-fold; P<0.001) mRNA after MI. Enhanced abundance of pro-IL-18 (1.4-fold; P<0.05), IL-18 receptor (3.5-fold; P<0.05) and IL-18 binding proteins (1.6-fold; P<0.05) was also demonstrated, whereas cardiac IL-18 protein decreased by 25% (P<0.05) following MI. However, the concentration of circulating IL-18 was significantly elevated (MI; 90.4+/-11.7 pg/ml, sham; 47.2+/-4.2 pg/ml; P<0.001). After MI, enhanced cardiac activity of the pro-IL-18 processing enzyme, caspase-1, was measured. Additionally, a 3.4-fold increase (P<0.001) in the activity of the IL-18 degrading enzyme, caspase-3, was found in cardiac tissue, which may explain the observed reduction of cardiac IL-18 protein abundance. Finally, IL-18 reduced shortening of electrically stimulated adult cardiomyocytes and left ventricular contractility in vivo.\nAfter MI in the mouse, increased production of cardiac IL-18 mRNA and pro-IL-18, as well as circulating IL-18 occurs.

CyA decreased the energy balance [adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/adenosine diphosphate (ADP)] in all organs (kidney [control]: 50%, liver: 64%, and heart: 62%, all P<0.01) due to decreased activity of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.

In addition to its complement inhibiting abilities, VCP can bind heparan sulfate on cell surfaces, resulting in further functional activities. Altogether, the multiple functions of VCP have been shown to reduce the inflammatory response of the host, helping the vaccinia virus to evade immune destruction. Recently, we reported that VCP is able to block hyperacute xenograft rejection, significantly prolonging graft survival in two separate in vivo heterotopic cervical cardiac xenograft models. Histopathological examination of the transplanted hearts receiving VCP revealed marked VCP deposition on the endothelium, a significant reduction in cardiac tissue damage, and significantly less C3, IgG and IgM deposition in the tissue. It is concluded that VCP may inhibit hyperacute xenorejection by binding to the endothelial surface, blocking complement fixation activation, thereby preventing xenoantibody attachment. In the current study, the level of serum complement inhibition was evaluated following different bolus dosages of VCP in baboons. The results indicated that to achieve a satisfactory level of complement inhibition higher doses of VCP are needed in baboons, than previously observed in rats.

{"title": "Pyruvate modulates cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in rats via mitochondria-dependent and -independent mechanisms.", "abstract": "The glycolytic product pyruvate has beneficial effects on cardiac contractile function. The postulated cellular mechanisms underlying the positive inotropic effect of pyruvate, however, are contradictory or have remained elusive. Therefore, we studied the effects of pyruvate on cardiac Ca2+ regulation, intracellular pH (pHi) and flavoprotein oxidation using fluorescence confocal microscopy in intact and permeabilized rat ventricular myocytes and single channel recordings from rat cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyRs) incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. In intact cells extracellular pyruvate (10 mM) elevated diastolic [Ca2+]i, which was due, at least in part, to a concomitant acidification of the cytosol. Furthermore, pyruvate increased the amplitude and slowed the kinetics of the electrically evoked [Ca2+]i transient, and augmented sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content. Recording of flavoprotein (FAD) fluorescence indicated that pyruvate caused a reduction of mitochondrial redox potential, which is proportional to an increase of the rate of ATP synthesis. Inhibitors of mitochondrial monocarboxylate transport (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, 0.5 mM), adenine nucleotide translocation (atractyloside, 0.3 mM) and the electron transport chain (cyanide, 4 mM) abolished or attenuated the pyruvate-mediated increase of the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient, but did not change the effect of pyruvate on diastolic [Ca2+]i. Results from experiments with permeabilized myocytes indicated a direct correlation between ATP/ADP ratio and SR Ca2+ content. Furthermore, pyruvate (4 mM) reduced the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks by approximately 50%. Single RyR channel recordings revealed a approximately 60% reduction of the open probability of the channel by pyruvate (1 mM), but no change in conductance. This effect of pyruvate on RyR channel activity was neither Ca2+ nor ATP dependent. Taken together, these findings suggest that, in cardiac tissue, pyruvate has a dual effect on SR Ca2+ release consisting of a direct inhibition of RyR channel activity and elevation of SR Ca2+ content. The latter effect was most probably mediated by an enhanced SR Ca2+ uptake due to an augmentation of mitochondria-dependent ATP synthesis.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2003-06-26", "authors": ["Aleksey VZima", "JensKocksk\u00e4mper", "RafaelMejia-Alvarez", "Lothar ABlatter"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2003.040345"}

{"title": "The effect of spatial scale of resistive inhomogeneity on defibrillation of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Defibrillation of cardiac tissue can be viewed in the context of dynamical systems theory as the attempt to move a dynamical system from the basin of attraction of one attractor (fibrillation) to another (the uniform rest state) by applying a stimulus whose form is physically constrained. Here we give an introduction to the physical mechanism of cardiac defibrillation from this dynamical perspective and examine the role of resistive inhomogeneity on defibrillation efficacy. Using numerical simulations with rotating waves on a one-dimensional periodic ring, we study the role of the spatial scale of resistive inhomogeneity on defibrillation. For a rotating wave on a periodic ring there are three stable attractors, namely the uniform rest state, a wave traveling clockwise and a wave traveling counterclockwise. As a result, the application of a stimulus has the potential for three different outcomes, namely elimination of the wave, phase resetting of the wave, and reversal of the wave. The results presented here show that with resistive inhomogeneities of large spatial scale, all three of these transitions are possible with large amplitude shocks, so that the probability of defibrillation is bounded well below one, independent of stimulus amplitude. On the other hand, resistive inhomogeneities of small spatial scale produce a defibrillation threshold that is qualitatively consistent with that found experimentally, namely the probability of defibrillation success is an increasing function that approaches one for large enough stimulus amplitude. Extending these results to higher dimensions, we describe conditions for successful defibrillation of functional reentry with large scale spatial inhomogeneity, but find that elimination of anatomical reentry is quite difficult. With small spatial scale inhomogeneity, there are no similar restrictions.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2003-06-20", "authors": ["James PKeener", "EricCytrynbaum"], "doi": "10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00089-4"}

We correlated the amount of tissue damage with these and other biophysical parameters and compared them with off-line analysis. We found that there are irreversible changes in the reactive and resistive components of impedance that occurred during tissue ablation. The irreversible changes of these components are greater in magnitude, and correlate better with the size of lesions than that of impedance alone that is currently used. Numerically, the best single on-line and off-line correlation for combined perpendicular and parallel electrode orientation was with phase angle.

Mitochondria isolated from ischemic hearts in a buffer containing KCl exhibited depressed rates of maximum respiration and a lower cytochrome c content relative to control mitochondria. The addition of cytochrome c restored maximum rates of respiration, indicating that the release of cytochrome c is responsible for observed declines in function. However, mitochondria isolated in a mannitol/sucrose buffer exhibited no ischemia-induced loss in cytochrome c content, indicating that ischemia does not on its own cause the release of cytochrome c. Nevertheless, state 3 respiratory rates remained depressed, and cytochrome c release was enhanced when mitochondria from ischemic relative to perfused tissue were subsequently placed in a high ionic strength buffer, hypotonic solution, or detergent. Thus, events that occur during ischemia favor detachment of cytochrome c from the inner membrane increasing the pool of cytochrome c available for release.

We recently demonstrated that polycystin-2 interacts with troponin I, an important regulatory component of the actin microfilament complex in striated muscle cells and an angiogenesis inhibitor. In this study, using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique and Xenopus oocyte expression system, we showed that the calcium-induced PCL channel activation is substantially inhibited by the skeletal and cardiac troponin I (60% and 31% reduction, respectively). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that PCL physically associates with the skeletal and cardiac troponin I isoforms in overexpressed Xenopus oocytes and mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, both native PCL and cardiac troponin I were present in human heart tissues where they indeed associate with each other. GST pull-down and microtiter binding assays showed that the C-terminus of PCL interacts with the troponin I proteins. The yeast two-hybrid assay further verified this interaction and defined the corresponding interacting domains of the PCL C-terminus and troponin I.

A total of 104 male Wistar rats, 21 days old, were randomly divided into eight groups. Five groups of experimental rats were severely malnourished (SM) and three further groups were considered well-nourished control groups (WN). A single dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was administered intraperitoneally. Blood samples were taken by heart puncture and five organs were extracted 0-24 h after the administration of the drug. HPLC was used to assess the amount of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in fluids. The elimination half-life for trimethoprim from plasma was longer in SM rats with a median of 3.15 h; in WN rats, it was 0.390 h. Clearance was slower in SM rats: 646.72 mL microg(-1) h(-1) vs 3036.38 mL microg(-1) h(-1) in WN rats (P < 0.05). Tissue penetration was much higher for trimethoprim, with penetration indexes of 0.80-5.66 in WN rats, compared with 0.35-2.14 in SM rats. In the case of sulfamethoxazole, penetration indexes were 0.029-1.13 for WN and 0.075-0.657 for SM rats. Similarly, the penetration ratio to muscle and heart tissue was lower in SM rats. However, penetration to kidney, lung, liver and spleen was greater in SM rats. It is evident that severe SM decreases the capacity of trimethoprim more importantly than sulfamethoxazole biotransformation.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology", "date": "2003-06-14", "authors": ["IsmaelLares-Asseff", "Maria GabrielaP\u00e9rez", "Guadalupe ACamacho", "Alejandra RToledo", "Mariadel Carmen L\u00f3pez", "Adri\u00e1n JGuill\u00e9", "Martha GSosa"], "doi": "10.1211/0022357021026"}

Most studies in the field of cardiac tissue repair are performed by direct intramyocardial injection of cells of different origin. Since this approach requires a surgical intervention, in this study we investigated the feasibility of non-invasive administration of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) by assessing the fate of peripherally injected, purified, labeled cells in cryodamaged hearts.\nTen donor and ten recipient inbred isogenic adult (4 weeks old) Fisher rats were used as models to mimic autologous transplantation. Myocardial damage was obtained in recipient rats by placing a frozen metal probe on the anterior left ventricular wall for 15 seconds (freeze-thaw injury technique). BMMNCs were purified and labeled with a red fluorescent cell dye. Seven days after the injury about 15-25x10(6) cells were infused through the femoral vein of recipient rats. Seven days after the infusion, the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen and thymus were harvested to track transplanted cells.\nLabeled cells were found only in the injured area of the heart and not in the normal tissue, and a limited number of cells were identified in the spleen of all the animals. Most of the labeled cells in the infarcted area were Thy-1(+) and some were CD34(+).\nOur data suggest that peripherally injected BMMNCs can traffic through the circulation to the site of damage; we hypothesize that tissue injury leads to the priming of a cytokine cascade acting as chemoattractant for the infused cells.", "journal": "Haematologica", "date": "2003-06-13", "authors": ["Michele MCiulla", "LorenzaLazzari", "RaffaellaPacchiana", "ArturoEsposito", "SilvanoBosari", "StefanoFerrero", "UmbertoGianelli", "RobertaPaliotti", "GiuseppeBusca", "AlessandraGiorgetti", "FabioMagrini", "PaoloRebulla"], "doi": null}

Ninety days after the induction of diabetes, semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coamplification of VEGF/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcription was performed. RT-PCR was also performed for VEGF receptors flk-1 and flt-1. VEGF mRNA expression, at 234 bp, was detectable in the heart of the rats and was significantly higher in those with diabetes. Densitometric analysis of PCR products showed that VEGF mRNA levels were meanly 4.8-fold higher in STZ-induced diabetic rats than controls (VEGF/GAPDH densitometric ratio, 3.46 +/- 0.20 v 0.74 +/- 0.10, P <.001).

The ability of VCP to bind heparan sulfate allows the protein to attach itself to the cell surface, enabling it with many additional activities. Altogether, the many functions of VCP have been shown to suppress the inflammatory response of the host, helping the vaccinia virus to evade immune destruction. VCP has recently been shown to inhibit human anti-Gal alpha1-3 Gal antibody attachment to cultured porcine endothelial cells and reduce human neutrophil and NK killing of pig aortic endothelial cells through its ability to bind heparan sulfate. Here we demonstrate that in an in vivo guinea pig-to-rat heterotopic cervical cardiac xenograft model, recombinant VCP (rVCP) is able to block hyperacute xenograft rejection, significantly prolonging graft survival. Histopathological examination of transplanted hearts from rats receiving rVCP revealed a significant reduction in cardiac tissue damage as compared to control hearts. Finally, rVCP treated recipients demonstrated marked rVCP deposition on the endothelium and significantly less C3, IgG and IgM deposition in the tissue. rVCP is therefore able to inhibit hyperacute xenorejection by binding the endothelial surface, blocking complement fixation and activation, and preventing xenoantibody attachment.", "journal": "Transplant immunology", "date": "2003-06-12", "authors": ["Jaime BAnderson", "Scott ASmith", "Rochellevan Wijk", "SufanChien", "Girish JKotwal"], "doi": "10.1016/S0966-3274(02)00149-1"}

This study employed Langendorff perfusion to determine the direct effects of As(2)O(3) in the electrophysiological properties of rabbit hearts after acute or chronic As(2)O(3) treatment (0.2 mg/kg/day iv for 30 days). Tissue accumulations of arsenicals and pathological changes as well as the reversibility of chronic As(2)O(3) effects were assessed. We found that cardiac conduction and repolarization were not altered whatsoever after acute As(2)O(3) treatment at clinically relevant (1, 3, and 10 microM) and higher (30 microM) doses. Nevertheless, an extremely high concentration of As(2)O(3) (300 microM) prolonged the corrected QT interval. Subsequent to chronic As(2)O(3) administration and with 30 microM As(2)O(3) via Langendorff perfusion, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was observed (1/7, 14%). Corrected QT interval was prolonged, while basic cycle length was shortened. Significant accumulation of arsenicals in the cardiac tissue was found, but without any pathological changes. After As(2)O(3) was discontinued for 30 days, the chronic As(2)O(3) -induced electrophysiological changes improved, no ventricular arrhythmia was noted, and the tissue concentration of arsenicals decreased considerably. We therefore conclude that, although no immediate cardiac effects were discemable at clinically relevant doses, an extremely high concentration of As(2)O(3) could prolong ventricular repolarization. Chronic As(2)O(3) treatment resulted in a prolonged ventricular repolarization, in association with arsenicals accumulation and with risk of ventricular tachycardia.

Several techniques aimed at recovering myocardial performance through the utilization of stem cells have been investigated in these last years. Embryonal stem cells, although they are characterized by an elevated differentiation potential, present technical and ethical concerns. Thus, most studies have been addressed towards adult (somatic) stem cells. Three categories of adult stem cells are now mainly investigated: a) satellite cells from skeletal muscle, b) mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow, c) stem cells which are eventually present in the cardiac tissue. Skeletal myoblasts, even if they are not able to differentiate in cardiomyocytes, can improve cardiac contractility at the level of the fibrous scare which substitutes the necrotic area. It is also possible to isolate stem cells from bone marrow which can originate several cell lines, among them cardiac muscle cells and endothelial cells. Finally, more recent studies have demonstrated that resident cardiomyocytes maintain the capability to duplicate: therefore, a population of myocardial progenitors might be able to replicate and repair the damaged tissue.

In order to identify the effect that each TR isoform exerts over the expression of the other, NCoA and TR transcripts were measured in liver and heart tissue from wild type mice or mice with deletion of either TR isoform or SRC-1 genes.

Earlier studies using bipolar electrodes indicated that the functional maturation of the HPS in the chick embryo is marked by a topological shift in the sequence of activation of the ventricle. Namely, at around the completion of septation, an immature base-to-apex sequence of ventricular activation was reported to convert to the apex-to-base pattern characteristic of the mature heart. Previously, we have proposed that hemodynamics and/or mechanical conditioning may be key epigenetic factors in development of the HPS. We thus hypothesized that the timing of the topological shift marking maturation of the conduction system is sensitive to variation in hemodynamic load. Spatiotemporal patterns of ventricular activation (as revealed by high-speed imaging of fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye) were mapped in chick hearts over normal development, and following procedures previously characterized as causing increased (conotruncal banding, CTB) or reduced (left atrial ligation, LAL) hemodynamic loading of the embryonic heart. The results revealed that the timing of the shift to mature activation displays striking plasticity. CTB led to precocious emergence of mature HPS function relative to controls whereas LAL was associated with delayed conversion to apical initiation.

Rats were fed either a high fructose diet or a starch-based diet, with or without supplementation of 10 g/100 g oligofructose for 4 wk. Regardless of the type of carbohydrate, OFS in the diet produced an enlargement of the cecum and led to a significant increase in the SCFA cecum pool. Fructose feeding was associated with significantly higher insulin plasma concentrations (+63%) in the control groups, whereas insulin plasma concentrations did not differ in rats fed the fructose diet supplemented with OFS. Plasma leptin concentration was significantly lower (approximately 50%) in the OFS-supplemented fructose group compared with the other three groups. Fructose feeding in rats also significantly increased plasma (P < 0.001) and liver (P < 0.001) triglyceride (TG) concentrations and the addition of OFS prevented the TG accumulation induced by fructose in the liver (P < 0.05) and hyperlipemia (P < 0.05). OFS consumption prevented (P < 0.05) the lower plasma vitamin E/TG ratio in rats fed the fructose diet. Control rats fed the fructose diet had high plasma TBARS values compared with rats fed the starch diet, whereas TBARS values remained unchanged when rats were supplemented with OFS. Control rats fed the fructose diet had higher TBARS urine values and higher heart tissue susceptibility to peroxidation compared with rats fed the starch diet, and this effect was significantly reduced by OFS consumption.

Arrhythmia incidence was monitored during 5-min balloon inflations performed without drug and at 15, 45, 75, and 105 min after NTG (4,000 microg bolus) administered by percutaneous transatrial access into the pericardial space. Electrocardiograms were monitored for ischemia-induced T-wave alternans (TWA), a marker of electrical instability. The antiadrenergic potential of NTG was investigated by examining the drug's suppression of dobutamine-induced increase in myocardial contractility.\nControl coronary artery occlusion provoked ventricular fibrillation (VF) in all animals. Intrapericardial NTG suppressed VF at 45 min in all six pigs (p < 0.05) and reduced TWA across a parallel time course (from 459.1 +/- 144.4 microV before drug to 42.22 +/- 13.96 microV at 45 min, p = 0.047). The antifibrillatory effect occurred as early as 15 min and persisted for up to 75 min. Augmentation of maximum of the first time derivative of left ventricular pressure by dobutamine was blunted by intrapericardial NTG (from 3,999 +/- 196 mm Hg/s before NTG to 3,543 +/- 220 mm Hg/s at 15 min, p = 0.012).\nIntrapericardial NTG exerts a robust antifibrillatory action.

The majority of pathogenic mutations are heteroplasmic, with mutated and wild-type mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) coexisting within the same cell. Homoplasmic mutations (present in every copy of the genome within the cell) present a difficult challenge in terms of diagnosis and assigning pathogenicity, as human mtDNA is highly polymorphic.\nA detailed clinical, histochemical, biochemical, and molecular genetic analysis was performed on two families with HCM to investigate the underlying mitochondrial defect.\nCardiac tissue from an affected child in the presenting family exhibited severe deficiencies of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, whereas histochemical and biochemical studies of the skeletal muscle were normal. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed an A4300G transition in the mitochondrial transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA)(Ile) gene, which was shown to be homoplasmic by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in all samples from affected individuals and other maternal relatives. In a second family, previously reported as heteroplasmic for this base substitution, the mutation has subsequently been shown to be homoplasmic. The pathogenic role for this mutation was confirmed by high-resolution Northern blot analysis of heart tissue from both families, revealing very low steady-state levels of the mature mitochondrial tRNA(Ile).\nThis report documents, for the first time, that a homoplasmic mitochondrial tRNA mutation may cause maternally inherited HCM. It highlights the significant contribution that homoplasmic mitochondrial tRNA substitutions may play in the development of cardiac disease.

DTMRI studies were performed on 15 excised, formalin-fixed rat hearts of both infarct (left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, n = 8) and control (sham, n = 7) rats.

The reduced diffusion anisotropy correlated negatively with microscopic fiber disarray determined by histological analysis (R = 0.81). Transmural courses of fiber orientation angles in infarct zones were similar to those of normal myocardium. However, regional angular deviation of the diffusion tensor increased significantly in the infarct myocardium and correlated strongly with microscopic fiber disarray (R = 0.86).

We describe here a novel smooth/striated chimeric isoform that was expressed in developing chick heart in addition to the classically described TM-4 type. This novel alpha-Tm tropomyosin isoform, designated as alpha-Tm-2, contains exon 2a (in place of exon 2b). The known striated muscle isoform (alpha-Tm-1) was also expressed in embryonic hearts along with the striated muscle isoform of TM-4. In adult heart, TM-4 was expressed, however, expression of both alpha-Tm-1 and alpha-Tm-2 isoforms was drastically reduced or downregulated. Interestingly, we were unable to detect the expression of alpha-Tm-2 in embryonic and adult skeletal muscle, however, the alpha-Tm-1 isoform is expressed in embryonic and adult skeletal muscle. Examination of other possible isoforms of the alpha-TM gene, i.e., alpha-smooth muscle tropomyosin (alpha-Sm), alpha-Fibroblast-1 (alpha-F1), and alpha-Fibroblast-2 (alpha-F2) revealed expression in embryonic hearts and a significant reduction of each of these isoforms in adult heart. In order to elucidate the role of the newly discovered tropomyosin isoform in chicken, we ectopically expressed the GFP fusion protein of alpha-Tm-1 and alpha-Tm-2 separately into cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal rats.

Specific knowledge concerning the differences is limited because the small numbers of spirochetes present in tissue have not been amenable to direct compositional analysis. In this report we describe novel means for studying the antigenic composition of host-adapted Borrelia (HAB). The detergent Triton X-114 was used to extract the detergent-phase HAB proteins from mouse ears, ankles, knees, and hearts. Immunoblot analysis revealed a profile distinct from that of in vitro-cultivated Borrelia (IVCB). OspA and OspB were not found in the tissues of SCID mice 17 days after infection. The amounts of antigenic variation protein VlsE and the relative amounts of its transcripts were markedly increased in ear, ankle, and knee tissues but not in heart tissue. VlsE existed as isoforms having both different unit sizes and discrete lower molecular masses. The hydrophobic smaller forms of VlsE were also found in IVCB. The amounts of the surface protein (OspC) and the decorin binding protein (DbpA) were increased in ear, ankle, knee, and heart tissues, as were the relative amounts of their transcripts. Along with these findings regarding VlsE, OspC, and DbpA, two-dimensional immunoblot analysis with immune sera also revealed additional details of the antigenic composition of HAB extracted from ear, heart, and joint tissues. A variety of novel antigens, including antigens with molecular masses of 65 and 30 kDa, were found to be upregulated in mouse tissues.

These findings led us to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of cytosolic Ca2+ in cardiac tissues from dogs chronically infected with T. cruzi. Expression of the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) RNA and protein was determined by Northern and Western blotting, respectively, followed by densitometric analyses. A 642-bp PMCA 1b complementary DNA probe derived from canine epicardial tissue hybridized to 2 major transcripts (7.3 and 5.3 kb) in canine epicardium.

To extend the potential of cell transplantation, we assessed this treatment in a mouse model of acute nonischemic doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.\nTo allow detection of engrafted cells, we used transgenic mice expressing the nuclear-located LacZ under the control of either desmin or vimentin promoters, which identify muscle lineage and mesenchymal cells, respectively. All transplanted cells were also labeled with the fluorescent dye DIL. One week after the administration of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg), mice were intramyocardially injected with either allogeneic unpurified bone marrow cells (6 x 10(6) in 30 microl, n=59) or purified sca-1(pos) cells (4 x 10(5) in 30 microl, n=22). In parallel, control normal mice received only unpurified bone marrow cells (n=28). Hearts were harvested at serial intervals until 2 weeks after transplantation and analyzed by immunohistochemistry to assess the degree of engraftment and transplanted cell differentiation.\nIn control mice, no differentiation of bone marrow cells was detected. In contrast, unpurified bone marrow cells grafted into diseased myocardium featured two successive phases of cell differentiation. The first yielded cells with a mesenchymal phenotype (44.1+/-10.1 cells/3 x 10(-2) mm(3) at 2 days), was transient and lasted 1 week. The second phase was characterized by cells with a muscular phenotype detected in a small number of cells (5.6+/-2.3 cells/3 x 10(-2) mm(3) at 7 days). Two weeks after transplantation, some of these cells appeared phenotypically close to cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by morphology and positive staining for myosin binding protein C, vinculin and myosin heavy chain. In sca-1(pos) hematopoietic progenitor grafted mice hearts, no transdifferentiation into cardiac cells was detected at any time point.\nThese data support the hypothesis of the potential for a myogenic differentiation of bone marrow cells following engraftment in a nonischemic model of global cardiomyopathy.

In the present study we investigated whether combining accepted mechanisms on propagation of the depolarization wave, time variant mechanical properties of cardiac tissue after depolarization, and hemodynamic load of the left ventricle (LV) by the aortic impedance in a three-dimensional finite element model results in a physiological pattern of cardiac contraction. We assumed that the delay between depolarization for all myocytes and the onset of crossbridge formation was constant. Two simulations were performed, one in which contraction was initiated according to the regular depolarization pattern (NORM simulation), and another in which contraction was initiated after synchronous depolarization (SYNC simulation). In the NORM simulation propagation of depolarization was physiological, but wall strain was unphysiologically inhomogeneous. When simulating LV mechanics with unphysiological synchronous depolarization (SYNC) myofiber strain was more homogeneous and more physiologic. Apparently, the assumption of a constant delay between depolarization and onset of crossbridge formation results in an unrealistic contraction pattern.

We observed that integrated backscatter increased by 100% in the viable zones of old animals after infarction, but remained relatively unaffected in the same regions of younger animals. Mathematical models of myocardial scattering behavior indicated that a 25% increase in stiffness of the extracellular matrix materials in viable zones likely occurred in the older animals. Alterations in gross tissue collagen content were not responsible for this increased stiffness.

In previous studies, it has been well established that activated leukocytes and coronary vascular endothelial cells play an important role in the development of cardiac tissue damage during ischemia followed by reperfusion. Interactions between both of these cell types require the expression of adhesion molecules on their surface. In certain conditions, on cell activation, the adhesion proteins may be released from activated cells in soluble form into circulation. The purpose of our study was to establish whether the use of blood cardioplegia modifies plasma levels of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), and soluble L-selectin (sL-selectin) in comparison with crystalloid cardioplegia in patients undergoing CABG.\nPatients undergoing CABG were classified into two groups to receive cold crystalloid cardioplegia (St. Thomas' Hospital) or cold blood cardioplegia (method of Buckberg), followed by a \"warm-shot\" of the solution.

New techniques for engineering cardiac tissue allow unprecedented means of modeling these phenomena in vitro.

To address these deficiencies, we developed a mathematical model to calculate the distribution of stress and strain in fibrous cardiac tissue. The fluid-fiber-collagen model characterizes the mechanical behavior of cardiac tissue and is solved analytically for the distributions of stress and strain along the myocardial fibers. An example application of the model is presented: modeling the distribution of strains in the vicinity of an ischemic region. The ischemic region is stretched during systole, as has been shown in previous one-dimensional models. Our model predicts a complex distribution of stretch in the border zone surrounding the ischemic region and in nonischemic regions surrounding the border zone.

{"title": "Mechanism of cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation in late preconditioning.", "abstract": "Although the cardioprotection of late preconditioning (PC) is known to be mediated by both inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the signaling mechanism responsible for COX-2 upregulation and the interaction between iNOS and COX-2 remain unknown. A total of 122 mice were used to address this issue. In wild-type mice preconditioned with six cycles of 4-min coronary occlusion-4-min reperfusion, ischemic PC resulted in rapid activation of nuclear STAT1/3 through tyrosine phosphorylation (STAT1: 339 +/- 48% of control; STAT3: 389 +/- 46% of control) and increased STAT1/3-DNA binding activity (687 +/- 58% of control) at 30 min after PC, with subsequent upregulation of COX-2 protein (373 +/- 60% of control) and activity(increased myocardial levels of PGE2, PGF(2alpha), and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)) at 24 h. However, COX-1 protein was not changed 24 h after ischemic PC. Pretreatment with the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor AG-490 before the six occlusion-reperfusion cycles blocked both the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1/3 and the subsequent upregulation of COX-2 protein, demonstrating a necessary role of the JAK-STAT pathway in the induction of COX-2. Targeted disruption of the iNOS gene (iNOS-/-) did not block the increased expression of COX-2 protein 24 h after ischemic PC but completely blocked the increase in COX-2 activity, whereas targeted disruption of the COX-2 gene (COX-2-/-) did not alter ischemic PC-induced iNOS induction. Immunoprecipitation of preconditioned heart tissues with anti-COX-2 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-iNOS antibodies revealed that the increased iNOS protein co-precipitated with COX-2. We conclude that (i) the upregulation of COX-2 protein expression after ischemic PC is mediated by a JAK1/2-STAT1/3-signaling cascade; (ii) COX-2 activity requires upregulated iNOS and iNOS-derived NO; and (iii) COX-2 forms complexes with iNOS, supporting a direct interaction between these two proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that myocardial COX-2 is upregulated via a JAK1/2-STAT1/3 pathway.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2003-05-10", "authors": ["Yu-TingXuan", "YiruGuo", "YanqingZhu", "HuiHan", "RobertLangenbach", "BuddhadebDawn", "RobertoBolli"], "doi": "10.1016/s0022-2828(03)00076-2"}
{"title": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 promotes contraction of collagen gel by cardiac fibroblasts through their differentiation into myofibroblasts.", "abstract": "Myofibroblasts and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are key elements of cardiac tissue fibrosis development. The aim of this study was to determine whether the ability of TGF-beta 1 to affect the contractile activity of cardiac fibroblasts depends on their differentiation into myofibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts (from male adult Wistar rats) from passage 2 were therefore cultured to confluency and incubated on a hydrated collagen gel, both with and without TGF-beta 1 (0, 20, 40, 100, 200, 400 or 600 pmol/l), for 1, 2 and 3 days in a Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) without fetal bovine serum (FBS). Growing cultures of cardiac fibroblasts were obtained by incubating second-passage fibroblasts in DMEM with 10% FBS with or without TGF-beta 1 (0 to 600 pmol/l) for 6 days. These fibroblasts were then further incubated on the collagen gel for 1, 2 and 3 days in DMEM without FBS. TGF-beta 1 dose-dependently increased the contraction of collagen gel mediated by cardiac fibroblasts, either added directly to the gel or after growing of the cardiac fibroblasts in the presence of TGF-beta 1 for 6 days, reaching a maximal effect at 100 pmol/l TGF-beta 1. In both culturing conditions, TGF-beta 1 also stimulated the [3H]-thymidine incorporation and the total protein content in the cardiac fibroblasts in the collagen gel lattice. TGF-beta 1 dose-dependently induced an increase in alpha-smooth muscle actin, a marker of myofibroblasts, in both culturing conditions. The TGF-beta 1-induced reduction of area of the collagen gel was negatively correlated to the TGF-beta 1-evoked appearance of alpha-smooth muscle actin in the collagen gel matrix. TGF-beta 1 increased the contractile activity of adult rat cardiac fibroblasts and their ability to differentiate into myofibroblasts. Because contractile activity was correlated with differentiation, the influence of TGF-beta 1 on cardiac fibroblast-induced collagen gel contraction may depend on the promotion of myofibroblast differentiation.", "journal": "Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology", "date": "2003-05-07", "authors": ["PLijnen", "VPetrov", "KRumilla", "RFagard"], "doi": "10.1358/mf.2003.25.2.723680"}

Mn content and relaxation parameters, T(1) and T(2), were measured in right plus left ventricular myocardium excised from isolated perfused rat hearts. In the experiments 5 min wash-in of MnCl(2) were followed by 15 min wash-out to remove extracellular (ec) Mn(2+) MnCl(2), 25 and 100 micro M, elevated tissue Mn content to six and 12 times the level of control (0 micro M MnCl(2)). Variations in perfusate calcium (Ca(2+)) during wash-in of MnCl(2) and experiments including nifedipine showed that myocardial slow Ca(2+) channels are the main pathway for Mn(2+) uptake and that Mn(2+) acts as a pure Ca(2+) competitor and a preferred substrate for slow Ca(2+) channel entry. Inversion recovery analysis at 20 MHz revealed two components for longitudinal relaxation: a short T(1 - 1) and a longer T(1 - 2). Approximate values for control and Mn-treated hearts were in the range 600-125 ms for T(1 - 1) and 2200-750 ms for T(1 - 2). The population fractions were about 59 and 41% for the short and the long component, respectively. The intracellular (ic) R(1 - 1) and R(2 - 1) correlated best with tissue Mn content. Applying two-site exchange analyses on the obtained T(1) data yielded results in parallel to, but also differing from, results reported with an ec contrast agent. The calculated lifetime of ic water (tau(ic)) of about 10 s is compatible with a slow water exchange in the present excised cardiac tissue. The longitudinal relaxivity of Mn ions in ic water [60 (s mM)(-1)] was about one order of magnitude higher than that of MnCl(2) in water in vitro [6.9 (s mM)(-1)], indicating that ic Mn-protein binding is an important potentiating factor in relaxation enhancement.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2003-05-06", "authors": ["WibekeNordh\u00f8y", "Henrik WAnthonsen", "MortenBruvold", "PerJynge", "JosteinKrane", "HeidiBrurok"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.817"}

Sialidase activity in cardiomyocyte-derived H9c2 cells was also increased by treatment with isoproterenol (10 microM) for 60 min. The effect of isoproterenol on sialidase activity was amplified by the addition of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Sialidase activity in H9c2 cells was elevated by treatment with dibutyryl cAMP plus IBMX without isoproterenol. The content of N-acetylneuraminic acid in cells decreased by 22% after treatment with isoproterenol plus IBMX. These results suggest that sialidase activity in rat cardiomyocytes is regulated by beta-adrenergic stimulators via a cAMP-dependent process.

Intracellular calcium is regulated by a number of calcium binding proteins including calmodulin. In cardiac tissue, calmodulin is known to regulate a variety of functions. Therefore, to identify possible relationships between calmodulin and the aging process, heart tissue was collected from rats aging 3 weeks to 1 year. Heart tissue was homogenized in a homogenizing buffer and processed for soluble and membrane fractions. These fractions were further subjected to heat treatment. The heat-treated extracts rich in heat stable proteins were used for different experiments. The calmodulin activity was determined as a measure of stimulation of activator deficient 3'-5' phosphodiesterase. The activity of calmodulin at different ages was compared, and no significant changes were observed between 3 weeks vs. 8 weeks, 3 weeks vs. 6 months, and 3 weeks vs. 1 year. The soluble fractions also followed a similar trend, but there was a significant difference between 3 weeks vs. 1 year. At this point we do not know whether the decrease in activity is due to lower expression of calmodulin or decreased ability to stimulate the target enzyme.

GDFS is a vertex-centered variant of the finite-volume method that ensures local flux conservation. Owing to an effectively lower dimensionality, the overall computation time is reduced compared to full 3-D models at the same spatial resolution.

LPC has been implicated in arrhythmogenesis during ischemia by increasing intracellular Ca2+. However, it is not known whether LPC influences atrial release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LPC on ANP secretion from isolated, perfused, beating rat atria. LPC (10 and 30 micromol/L) caused decreases in ANP secretion in a dose-dependent manner, with slight increases in intra-atrial pressure and extracellular fluid (ECF) translocation. Therefore, the ANP secretion in terms of ECF translocation was markedly decreased by LPC. The order of the suppressive effect of ANP release was stearoyl-LPC>LPC>myristoyl-LPC=lauroyl-LPC. Staurosporine and wortmannin significantly attenuated suppression of the ANP release and an increase in intra-atrial pressure by LPC. High extracellular Mg2+ also attenuated the LPC-induced suppression of ANP release. However, other protein kinase C inhibitors such as chelerythrine, GF 109203X, and tamoxifen citrate did not affect LPC-induced suppression of ANP release. In single atrial myocytes, LPC caused increases in intracellular Ca2+ in a dose-dependent manner. The order of an increase in intracellular Ca2+ by LPC was stearoyl-LPC>LPC>myristoyl-LPC=lauroyl-LPC.

We present several visualization methods that are useful for distinguishing between anodal-make and anodal-break excitation. In the 4-mM situation, stimulation occurred by the make, or stimulus-onset, mechanism that involved propagation out of the virtual cathodes.

{"title": "Expression and modulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein messenger ribonucleic acid in rat cardiocytes and after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "We examined whether the mRNA for steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, a crucial factor in the rate-limiting step of aldosterone biosynthesis, is expressed and regulated in rat heart. We performed quantitative RT-PCR for StAR mRNA in an in vitro and an in vivo model: purified rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in primary culture and myocardial infarction (MI) in the rat. StAR mRNA was expressed in cultured cardiomyocytes, and angiotensin II (10 nM) increased it in a time-dependent fashion (132 +/- 2.7% of controls after 24 h; n = 3; P < 0.05). Concomitantly, angiotensin II stimulated aldosterone production in the culture medium from 32.6 +/- 6.1 to 54 +/- 12.7 fmol/mg protein after 24 h (n = 8; P < 0.05). StAR mRNA levels in cardiomyocytes were dramatically reduced after 24-h treatment with dexamethasone in a concentration-dependent manner (50% inhibitory concentration, 10 nM); maximal inhibition (to 15 +/- 6% of control; P < 0.001; n = 6) was achieved with 100 nM dexamethasone. This inhibition was prevented by RU486. In the rat MI model, StAR mRNA was also present in control heart tissue and was increased 2.4-fold in the noninfarcted area of the left ventricle after MI (n = 6; P < 0.01). This effect was completely prevented by treatment with losartan (8 mg/kg per d) and spironolactone (80 mg/kg per d), which reduced StAR mRNA levels to values not different from those in non-MI controls. Thus, the mRNA for an indispensable factor in aldosterone biosynthesis, the StAR protein, is expressed in the rat heart and is up-regulated after MI. These results support the view of a local synthesis of aldosterone in the heart and of intracrine/paracrine deleterious effects of the mineralocorticoid in heart failure.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2003-04-17", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9s JCasal", "Jean-S\u00e9bastienSilvestre", "ClaudeDelcayre", "Alessandro MCapponi"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2002-220943"}
{"title": "Cardiostimulant and cardiodepressant effects through overexpressed human beta2-adrenoceptors in murine heart: regional differences and functional role of beta1-adrenoceptors.", "abstract": "(-)-Isoprenaline enhances cardiac contractility through beta-adrenoceptors. However, in cardiac tissue from transgenic mice with a 200-400-fold cardiac overexpression of the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor (TG4) we observed a pronounced cardiodepression at high (-)-isoprenaline concentrations. Here, we investigated the functional role of the coexisting beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenoceptor subtypes in several regions of the TG4 heart, and in particular their contribution to the negative inotropic effect. In paced TG4 left atria, (-)-isoprenaline produced bell-shaped concentration-effect curves increasing (-logEC(50)M=9.0) and decreasing (-logIC(50)M=6.4) contractile force. These effects were unaffected by the beta(1)-selective CGP 20712A (300 nM). The beta(2)-selective inverse agonist ICI 118,551 (30-1,000 nM) antagonised in surmountable manner both the positive and negative inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline with similar concentration-dependence, consistent with an exclusive mediation through beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The beta(3)-adrenoceptor-selective agonist BRL37344 (1 nM-10 microM) failed to produce significant inotropic effects in TG4 left atria. Subsequently, we measured left atrial action potentials accompanying the inotropic changes induced by (-)-isoprenaline. Action potentials tended to have shorter duration in left atria from TG4 mice than from non-transgenic littermate mice. However, (-)-isoprenaline prolonged the duration of 30% repolarisation in atria from non-transgenic littermate but not from TG4 mice, while 90% repolarisation was abbreviated in both groups of atria. Negative inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline were also observed in right ventricular preparations. Pertussis toxin-treatment of the mice abolished the negative inotropic effects in left atria and reduced cardiodepression in right ventricle, indicating an involvement of beta(2)-adrenoceptor coupling to PTX-sensitive G-proteins. In additional experiments, designed to study the native murine beta(1)-adrenoceptor function, we used the physiological beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist (-)-noradrenaline. In the presence of 600 nM ICI 118,551 we failed to find a functional role of the beta(1)-adrenoceptors in left atria, and detected only a marginal contribution to the positive chronotropic effect in right atria. We also investigated the effects of the non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP 12177 (0.2 nM-6 microM), which in wild-type mice causes tachycardia through beta(1)-adrenoceptors. In TG4 right atria, however, (-)-CGP 12177-evoked tachycardia was resistant to blockade by CGP 20712A but antagonised by ICI 118,551, consistent with mediation through human beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The results from TG4 mice suggest that the positive and negative inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline are mediated through human overexpressed beta(2)-adrenoceptors coupled to G(s) protein and G(i) protein, respectively. The (-)-isoprenaline-evoked shortening of the atrial action potential combined with reduced responses of L-type Ca(2+) current may contribute to the negative inotropic effects.

The phase response of our model cell compares favorably with measurements on isolated sinoatrial node cells. We investigated the phase response to single depolarizing stimuli as a function of the stimulus parameters (phase response curves), and then studied cell responses to the combined effect of a pulse train (entrainment phenomena). The range of magnitudes and durations for the stimuli were 0.01-5 nA and 0.01-50 ms. Comparisons of the entrainment properties of the model with experimental results show good agreement with similar modes and different entrainment ratios occurring for similar basic cycle lengths (as functions of the unperturbed cell period).

Ketotifen, however, was unable to restore sensitivity of BCRP-overexpressing MCF-7/mx cells or MRP-overexpressing MCF-7/vp cells to mitoxantrone or VP-16, respectively. In vivo, pretreatment of mice with ketotifen caused an increased accumulation of doxorubicin in cardiac tissue, consistent with a block in drug clearance. However, unlike verapamil, ketotifen pretreatment did not enhance doxorubicin toxicity but in fact provided protection, both at the level of cardiac tissue damage and in terms of survival.\nTaken together, these observations show that ketotifen is unique in its ability both to reverse multidrug resistance due to P-glycoprotein overexpression and to provide cardioprotection to doxorubicin.", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2003-04-11", "authors": ["YichengZhang", "Stuart ABerger"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-003-0600-5"}

{"title": "The protective effect of cardiac gene transfer of CuZn-sod in comparison with the cardioprotector monohydroxyethylrutoside against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in cultured cells.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is related to its production of free radicals that specifically affect heart tissue because of its low antioxidant status. Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER), a potent antioxidant flavonoid, is under development as a protector against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The overexpression of high levels of superoxide dismutase (sod) protects against free radical damage in transgenic mice. Seeking alternatives besides the few cardioprotectors that are presently under investigation, the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of cardiac gene transfer of CuZn-sod compared with that of the presently most promising cardioprotector monoHER against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic effects on neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NeRCaMs) in vitro. NeRCaMs were infected with different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) of adenovirus encoding CuZn-sod (AdCuZn-sod). A control infection with an adenovirus vector encoding a nonrelated protein was included. The overexpression of CuZn-sod was characterized within 3 days postinfection. For doxorubicin treatment, NeRCaMs were divided into three groups. The first group was infected with AdCuZn-sod before treatment with doxorubicin (0-50 microM). The second and third groups were treated with doxorubicin (0-50 microM) alone and with 1 mM monoHER, respectively. The LDH release and survival of treated cells were measured 24 and 48 hours after doxorubicin treatment. The beating rate was followed during the 3 days after doxorubicin (0-100 microM) treatment. At the third day after infection with an MOI of 25 plaque-forming unit (PFU) of AdCuZn-sod/cell, the activity of CuZn-sod significantly increased (five-fold, P=.029). Higher MOI produced cytopathic effects (CPEs). Doxorubicin alone produced significant concentration- and time-dependent reduction in NeRCaMs beating rate and survival (P < .0005). Doxorubicin (> or =50 microM)-treated cells ceased to beat after 24 hours. This cytotoxicity was associated with an increase in the LDH release from the treated cells (P <.0005). The five-fold increase in the activity of CuZn-sod did not protect against any of the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin on NeRCaMs. In contrast, monoHER (1 mM) protected against the lethal effects of doxorubicin on the survival, LDH release and the beating rate of NeRCaMs (P <.004) during 48 hours after doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin-treated (< or =100 microM) cells continued beating for >72 hours in the presence of monoHER. The present study showed the lack of adenoviral CuZn-sod gene-transfer to protect myocardiocytes against doxorubicin-induced toxicity and confirms the efficacy of monoHER cardioprotection. Thus, a gene-therapy strategy involving overexpression of CuZn-sod to protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is not feasible with the currently available adenovirus vectors.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2003-04-08", "authors": ["M A IAbou El Hassan", "MHeijn", "M J W ERabelink", "W J Fvan der Vijgh", "ABast", "R CHoeben"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700564"}

{"title": "Oral administration of trans-resveratrol to guinea pigs increases cardiac DT-diaphorase and catalase activities, and protects isolated atria from menadione toxicity.", "abstract": "Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural phytoalexin found in grapes and wine. It has antioxidant and antiproliferative activities, and has been shown to induce NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, also known as DT-diaphorase, in cultured mouse hepatoma cells. DT-diaphorase is a detoxifying enzyme for quinone-containing substances, due to its ability to prevent their one-electron reduction and the consequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oral administration of trans-resveratrol to guinea pigs (60 mg/l in tap water for 16 days, ad libitum) increases cardiac DT-diaphorase and, consequently, reduces the response of isolated atria to 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione), the positive inotropic effect of which is related to the amount of ROS generated by its cardiac metabolism. In the cardiac tissue of resveratrol-treated animals, DT-diaphorase activity was significantly higher than that measured in control animals, the V(max) of the enzyme reaction being 75.47 +/- 3.87 and 50.73 +/- 0.63 nmoles/mg protein/min, respectively (p < 0.05). Resveratrol administration also significantly increased the activity of cardiac catalase (32.20 +/- 2.39 vs. 25.14 +/- 3.85 units/mg protein in treated and control animals, respectively; p < 0.001). As a consequence, menadione metabolism by the cardiac homogenate obtained from resveratrol-treated animals generated a smaller amount of ROS and, in electrically driven left atria, menadione produced a significantly lower increase in the force of contraction than in atria isolated from control animals.

During ischemia, saline, lo-P, or hi-P was perfused through the aorta at 60 microL/min. During the first 15 min of reperfusion, propofol (5 or 12 microg/mL) was continued, followed by perfusion with 5 microg/mL propofol for 75 min in both propofol-treated groups. After 90 min of reperfusion (Rep-90), heart tissues were harvested for assessment of antioxidant status. In hi-P, we observed increased latency to and greater reduction of ischemic contracture relative to the lo-P or control groups. 15-F2t-Isoprostane concentrations increased during ischemia and were significantly lower in hi-P and lo-P than in control (P < 0.01). At Rep-90, myocardial functional recovery was greater in both propofol-treated groups relative to control, and it correlated positively with tissue antioxidant capacity preservation. Tissue antioxidant capacity was better preserved in hi-P than in lo-P treatment (P < 0.05).

The underlying mechanisms for these changes remain unclear. Because the mammalian counterpart of the fish calcium-regulating hormone stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is expressed in the heart, we reasoned that STC1 might play a role in the adaptive-maladaptive processes that lead to the heart failure phenotype. We examined the expression and localization of STC1 in cardiac tissue of patients with advanced heart failure before and after mechanical unloading using a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and we compared the results with those of normal heart tissue. STC1 protein is markedly upregulated in cardiomyocytes and arterial walls of failing hearts pre-LVAD and is strikingly reduced after LVAD treatment. STC1 is diffusely expressed in cardiomyocytes, although nuclear predominance is apparent. Addition of recombinant STC1 to the medium of cultured rat cardiomyocytes slows their endogenous beating rate and diminishes the rise in intracellular calcium with each contraction. Furthermore, using whole cell patch-clamp studies in cultured rat cardiomyocytes, we find that addition of STC1 to the bath causes reversible inhibition of transmembrane calcium currents through L-channels. Our data suggest differential regulation of myocardial STC1 protein expression in heart failure. In addition, STC1 may regulate calcium currents in cardiomyocytes and may contribute to the alterations in calcium homeostasis of the failing heart.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinases in the regulation of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A.", "abstract": "The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase SGK1 and its isoform SGK3 are both expressed in cardiac tissue. One of the functions of SGK1 is the phosphorylation and inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, which in turn could be shown to downregulate the voltage-gated Na+ channel SCN5A (hH1). The present study has been performed to test for a role of SGK1 and SGK3 in the regulation of SCN5A. To this end cRNA encoding the human Na+ channel SCN5A was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes with or without cRNA encoding the wild-type kinases SGK1, the constitutively active kinase (S422D)SGK1, the inactive form K127NSGK1 or the wild-type SGK3. SCN5A currents were activated by coexpression of either wild-type SGK1 or SGK3 or the constitutively active S422DSGK1. In contrast, the inactive mutant K127NSGK1 significantly decreased the currents. Moreover, coexpression of SGK3 significantly altered SCN5A gating, i.e. it hyperpolarized the activation threshold and depolarized the prepotential required for 50% availability of the channel. Opposite shifts of gating properties were elicited by mutation of serine to alanine (S483ASCN5A and S663ASCN5A) in the SGK consensus sequences of SCN5A. The present observations disclose a role of the kinases SGK1 and SGK3 in the regulation of cardiac Na+ channels. As SGK1 is upregulated by glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and a variety of inflammatory mediators and both kinases are activated by insulin and IGF1, the kinases could mediate effects of those hormones and mediators on cardiac function.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2003-03-26", "authors": ["ChristophBoehmer", "ViktoriaWilhelm", "MonicaPalmada", "SabineWallisch", "GuidoHenke", "HeinrichBrinkmeier", "PhilipCohen", "BurkertPieske", "FlorianLang"], "doi": "10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00837-4"}
{"title": "[Na+]i handling in the failing human heart.", "abstract": "Proper contractile function of the heart depends on intact excitation-contraction processes and ion homeostasis of the myocytes. The Ca2+ ion activates contraction through its binding to troponin C. However, Ca2+ homeostasis is tightly linked to Na+ regulation because the primary mechanism for Ca2+ efflux in cardiac myocytes is via electrogenic Na+/Ca2+-exchange. While altered Ca2+-homeostasis has been demonstrated in animal models of heart failure and failing human cardiac tissue, the role of dysfunctional Na+ handling processes in altered excitation-contraction coupling remains obscure. Furthermore, altered Na+ handling has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes, such as regulation of membrane potential, pH, and growth. This review will discuss (1) the evidence for altered [Na+]i homeostasis in the failing human heart, (2) how alterations in the Na+ electrochemical gradient can influence Ca2+ handling, contractile function, and a number of other cellular processes, and (3) the potential defects in Na+ channels and transporters that may underlie altered [Na+]i in the failing human heart.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2003-03-26", "authors": ["BurkertPieske", "Steven RHouser"], "doi": "10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00841-6"}

Cardiac ventricular myocytes were isolated enzymatically by collagenase and exposed to 5 min of anoxia followed by 10 min of reoxygenation. SM (1-9 g/L) depressed both contraction and the [Ca(2+)](i) transient in a dose-dependent manner. SM did not affect the diastolic calcium level and the sarcolemmal Ca(2+) channel of myocytes but decreased the caffeine-induced calcium release. During anoxia, the +/-dL/dtmax, amplitudes of contraction (dL) of cell contraction and [Ca(2+)](i) transients were decreased, while the diastolic calcium level was increased. None of the parameters returned to the pre-anoxia level during reoxygenaton. However, SM (3 g/L) did attenuate the changes in cell contraction and intracellular calcium induced by anoxia and reoxygenation. It is concluded that SM has different effects on normoxic and anoxic cardiomyocytes. The SM-induced reduction of changes in contraction and intracellular calcium induced by anoxia/reoxygenation indicates that SM may be beneficial for cardiac tissue in recovery of mechanical function and intracellular calcium homeostasis.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2003-03-26", "authors": ["Chun-MeiCao", "QiangXia", "XiongZhang", "Wan-HongXu", "Hui-DiJiang", "Jun-ZhuChen"], "doi": "10.1016/s0024-3205(03)00142-5"}

In cultured human fibroblasts, the concentration of transforming growth factor-beta in the supernatant of medium was significantly increased after injection of human chymase. Furthermore, human chymase dose dependently increased cell proliferation, and this chymase-dependent proliferation was completely suppressed by a chymase inhibitor, Suc-Val-Pro-Phe(p)(OPh)(2) (10 micro M) or an anti-transforming growth factor-beta antibody (100 micro g/ml). In this study, we used Bio14.6 and F1B hamsters as cardiomyopathic and control hamsters, respectively.

Production of this fusion protein in Bacillus subtilis and Pichia pastoris was examined. The Kringle domain in the fusion protein produced from B. subtilis was improperly folded because of its complicated disulfide-bond profile, whereas the staphylokinase domain produced from P. pastoris was only partially active because of an N-linked glycosylation. A change of the glycosylation residue, Thr-30, to alanine resulted in a non-glycosylated biologically active fusion. The resulting mutein, designated SAKM3-L-K1, was overproduced in P. pastoris. Each domain in SAKM3-L-K1 was functional, and this fusion showed fibrin binding ability by binding directly to plasmin-digested clots. In vitro fibrin clot lysis in a static environment and plasma clot lysis in a flow-cell system demonstrated that the engineered fusion outperformed the non-fused staphylokinase. The time required for 50% clot lysis was reduced by 20 to 500% under different conditions.

{"title": "The G-protein regulator AGS3 controls an early event during macroautophagy in human intestinal HT-29 cells.", "abstract": "AGS3 contains GoLoco or G-protein regulatory motifs in its COOH-terminal half that stabilize the GDP-bound conformation of the alpha-subunit of the trimeric Gi3 protein. The latter is part of a signaling pathway that controls the lysosomal-autophagic catabolism in human colon cancer HT-29 cells. In the present work we show that the mRNA encoding for AGS3 is expressed in human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) whatever their state of differentiation. Together with the full-length form, minute amounts of the mRNA encoding a NH2-terminal truncated form of AGS3, previously characterized in cardiac tissues, were also detected. Both the endogenous form of AGS3 and a tagged expressed form have a localization compatible with a role in the Galphai3-dependent control of autophagy. Accordingly, expressing its non-Galphai3-interacting NH2-terminal domain or its Galphai3-interacting COOH-terminal domain reversed the stimulatory role of AGS3 on autophagy. On the basis of biochemical and morphometric analysis, we conclude that AGS3 is involved in an early event during the autophagic pathway probably prior to the formation of the autophagosome.

In this study, we investigated the potential role of tissue kallikrein and Trasylol, an inhibitor of tissue kallikrein, on survival time with acute left coronary artery ligation for 15 min in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Tissue kallikrein (8 and 16 microg/kg, i.v.) treatment caused significant (P<0.05) increases in the survival time of SHR as compared with the saline-treated control SHR. Trasylol pretreatment abolished (P<0.05) the beneficial effect on tissue kallikrein on survival time. The ligation of coronary artery resulted in significant (P<0.05) reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) of SHR compared with the saline-treated control SHR. The tissue kallikrein treatment caused greater (P<0.001) reduction in the SBP, DBP and HR of SHR, when the mean values were compared between before coronary artery ligation and after coronary artery ligation. Trasylol (6 microg/kg) treatment antagonized the effects of tissue kallikrein associated with survival time, SBP, DBP and HR.

We hypothesized that rapid gel-cell inoculation in conjunction with direct medium perfusion through the seeded scaffold would increase the rate, yield, viability, and uniformity of cell seeding. Two cell types were studied: neonatal rat cardiomyocytes for feasibility studies of seeding and cultivation with direct medium perfusion, and C2C12 cells (a murine myoblast cell line) for detailed seeding studies. Cells were seeded at densities corresponding to those normally present in the adult rat heart ([0.5-1] x 10(8) cells/cm(3)), into collagen sponges (13 mm x 3 mm discs), using Matrigel as a vehicle for rapid cell delivery. Scaffolds inoculated with cell-gel suspension were seeded either in perfused cartridges with alternating medium flow or in orbitally mixed Petri dishes. The effects of seeding time (1.5 or 4.5 h), initial cell number (6 or 12 million cells per scaffold), and seeding set-up (medium perfusion at 0.5 and 1.5 mL/min; orbitally mixed dishes) were investigated using a randomized three-factor factorial experimental design with two or three levels and three replicates. The seeding cell yield was consistently high (over 80%), and it appeared to be determined by the rapid gel inoculation. The decrease in cell viability was markedly lower for perfused cartridges than for orbitally mixed dishes (e.g., 8.8 +/- 0.8% and 56.3 +/- 4%, respectively, for 12 million cells at 4.5 h post-seeding). Spatially uniform cell distributions were observed in perfused constructs, whereas cells were mainly located within a thin (100-200 microm) surface layer in dish seeded constructs. Over 7 days of cultivation, medium perfusion maintained the viability and differentiated function of cardiac myocytes, and the constructs contracted synchronously in response to electrical stimulation.

{"title": "Differential effects of fluoxetine enantiomers in mammalian neural and cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Racemic fluoxetine is a widely used SSRI antidepressant compound having also anticonvulsant effect. In addition, it was shown that it blocked several types of voltage gated ion channels including neural and cardiac calcium channels. In the present study the effects of enantiomers of fluoxetine (R(-)-fluoxetine and S(+)-fluoxetine) were compared on neuronal and cardiac voltage-gated Ca2+ channels using the whole cell configuration of patch clamp techniques, and the anticonvulsant action of these enantiomers was also evaluated in a mouse epilepsy model. In isolated pyramidal neurons of the dorsal cochlear nucleus of the rat the effect of fluoxetine (S(+), R(-) and racemic) was studied on the Ca2+ channels by measuring peak Ba2+ current during ramp depolarizations. All forms of fluoxetine reduced the Ba2+ current of the pyramidal cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a Kd value of 22.3+/-3.6 microM for racemic fluoxetine. This value of Kd was higher by one order of magnitude than found in cardiac myocytes with fluoxetine enantiomers (2.4+/-0.1 and 2.8+/-0.2 microM). Difference between the effects of the two enantiomers on neuronal Ba2+ current was observed only at 5 microM concentration: R(-)-fluoxetine inhibited 28+/-3% of the peak current, while S(+)-fluoxetine reduced the current by 18+/-2% (n=13, P<0.05). In voltage clamped canine ventricular cardiomyocytes both enantiomers of fluoxetine caused a reversible concentration-dependent block of the peak Ca2+ current measured at 0 mV. Significant differences between the two enantiomers in this blocking effect was observed at low concentrations only: S(+)-fluoxetine caused a higher degree of block than R(-)-fluoxetine (56.3+/-2.2% versus 49.1+/-2.2% and 95.5+/-0.9% versus 84.5+/-3.1% block with 3 and 10 microM S(+) and R(-)-fluoxetine, respectively, P<0.05, n=5). Studied in current clamp mode, micromolar concentrations of fluoxetine shortened action potential duration of isolated ventricular cells, while higher concentrations also suppressed maximum velocity of depolarization and action potential amplitude. This shortening effect was significantly greater in the case of S(+) than R(-)-fluoxetine at 1 and 3 microM concentrations, whereas no differences in their effects on depolarization were observed. In pentylenetetrazole-induced mouse epilepsy model fluoxetine pretreatment significantly increased the 60 min survival rate, survival duration and seizure latency. These effects were more pronounced with the R(-) than the S(+) enantiomer. The results indicate that fluoxetine exerts much stronger suppressive effect on cardiac than neuronal calcium channels. At micromolar concentrations (between 1 and 10 microM) R(-)-fluoxetine is more effective than the S(+) enantiomer on neuronal, while less effective on cardiac calcium channels. The stronger anticonvulsant effect of the R(-) enantiomer may, at least partially, be explained by these differences.

The majority of Na(+) channels in the heart contain tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive Na(v)1.5 alpha subunits, but TTX-sensitive brain-type Na(+) channel alpha subunits are present and functionally important in the transverse tubules of ventricular myocytes. Sinoatrial (SA) nodal cells were identified in cardiac tissue sections by staining for connexin 43 (which is expressed in atrial tissue but not in SA node), and Na(+) channel localization was analyzed by immunocytochemical staining with subtype-specific antibodies and confocal microscopy. Brain-type TTX-sensitive Na(v)1.1 and Na(v)1.3 alpha subunits and all four beta subunits were present in mouse SA node, but Na(v)1.5 alpha subunits were not. Na(v)1.1 alpha subunits were also present in rat SA node. Isolated mouse hearts were retrogradely perfused in a Langendorff preparation, and electrocardiograms were recorded. Spontaneous heart rate and cycle length were constant, and heart rate variability was small under control conditions. In contrast, in the presence of 100 nM TTX to block TTX-sensitive Na(+) channels specifically, we observed a significant reduction in spontaneous heart rate and markedly greater heart rate variability, similar to sick-sinus syndrome in man. We hypothesize that brain-type Na(+) channels are required because their more positive voltage dependence of inactivation allows them to function at the depolarized membrane potential of SA nodal cells.

We have demonstrated that IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) provides superior antioxidant efficacy as compared to Vitamins C, E and beta-carotene. A series of studies were conducted using GSPE to demonstrate its cardioprotective ability in animals and humans. GSPE supplementation improved cardiac functional assessment including post-ischemic left ventricular function, reduced myocardial infarct size, reduced ventricular fibrillation (VF) and tachycardia, decreased the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as detected by ESR spectroscopy and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in the heart perfusate. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. In concert, the proapoptotic signals mediated by JNK-l and c-fos proteins were also reduced suggesting that the novel cardioprotective properties of GSPE may be at least partially attributed to its ability to block anti-death signaling mediated through the proapoptotic transcription factors and genes such as JNK-1 and c-JUN. In a separate study, GSPE pretreatment significantly inhibited doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as demonstrated by reduced serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, DNA damage and histopathological changes in the cardiac tissue of mice.

SHR (7 weeks) were fed a purified diet with either a combination of corn/soybean oils or a DHA-enriched oil for 6 weeks. Histological evaluation of heart tissue, aorta, coronary, and renal arteries was performed. Vascular responses were determined in isolated aortic rings. Contractile responses to agonists, including norepinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-4) M), potassium chloride (5-55 mM), and angiotensin II (5 x 10(-7) M) were assessed. Vasorelaxant responses to acetylcholine (10(-9) to 10 (-4) M), sodium nitroprusside (10(-9) to 10(-6) M), papaverine (10(-5) to 10(-4) M), and methoxyverapamil (D600, 1-100 microM) were determined. DHA-fed SHR had significantly reduced blood pressure (P < 0.001) and vascular wall thicknesses in the coronary, thoracic, and abdominal aorta compared with controls (P < 0.05) Contractile responses to agonists mediated by receptor stimulation and potassium depolarization were not altered in DHA-fed SHR. Endothelial-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were not altered which suggests endothelial-derived nitric oxide production/release is not affected by dietary DHA. Other mechanisms of vascular relaxation, including intracellular cyclic nucleotides, cGMP, and cAMP were not altered by dietary DHA because aortic relaxant responses to sodium nitroprusside and papaverine were similar in control and DHA-fed SHR. No significant differences were seen in relaxant responses to the calcium channel blocker, D600, or contractile responses to norepinephrine in the absence of extracellular calcium. These results suggest that dietary DHA does not affect mechanisms related to extracellular calcium channels or intracellular calcium mobilization. Moreover, the contractile and vasorelaxant responses are not differentially altered with dietary DHA in this in vivo SHR model. The findings demonstrate that dietary DHA reduces systolic blood pressure and vascular wall thickness in SHR.

TMC-DLLA copolymers with either 20 or 50 mol% of TMC are totally amorphous and very flexible, making them excellent polymers for the preparation of porous scaffolds for heart tissue engineering. Porous structures of TMC-DLLA copolymers were prepared by compression molding and particulate leaching techniques. TMC-CL (co)polymers were processed into porous two-ply tubes by means of salt leaching (inner layer) and fiber winding (outer layer) techniques.

The search for anti-invasive treatments led us to screen compounds of different classes for their effect in an assay for invasion. Thirty-nine new compounds synthesized in the present study along with 56 already reported compounds belonging mainly to the classes of lactones, pyrazoles, isoxazoles, coumarins, desoxybenzoins, aromatic ketones, chalcones, chromans, isoflavanones have been tested against organotypic confronting cultures of invasive human MCF-7/6 mammary carcinoma cells with embryonic chick heart fragments in vitro. Three of them (a pyrazole derivative, an isoxazolylcoumarin and a prenylated desoxybenzoin) inhibited invasion at concentrations as low as 1 microM; instead of occupying and replacing the heart tissue within 8 days, the MCF-7/6 cells grew around the heart fragments and left it intact, when treated with these compounds. At the anti-invasive concentration of 1 microM, the three compounds did not affect the growth of the MCF-7/6 cells, as shown in the sulforhodamine B assay. Aggregate formation on agar was not stimulated by any of the three anti-invasive compounds, making an effect on the E-cadherin/catenin complex improbable. This is an invasion suppressor that can be activated in MCF-7/6 cells by a number of other molecules.

Our previous kinetic study suggested saturable myocardial uptake of idarubicin. This study sought to determine the effects of temperature reduction and of doxorubicin coadministration on the transport process.\nIn Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, a 0.5 mg dose of idarubicin was infused over 10 min. The outflow concentration-time curve as well as the residual amounts in cardiac tissue of idarubicin and its active metabolite idarubicinol were measured after temperature reduction (from 37 degrees C to 30 degrees C) and in the presence of doxorubicin (20 microM) in the perfusate. The outflow concentration-time profile of idarubicin was analyzed by a four-compartment model and simultaneous nonlinear regression.\nDoxorubicin significantly inhibited the Michaelis-Menten-like uptake process of idarubicin in the heart (50% decrease in Vmax), leading to a decreased net tissue uptake of idarubicin. Kinetic analysis of sensitivity to temperature reduction revealed a 2.6-fold increase in KM; however, this inhibition of idarubicin uptake was counterbalanced by a decrease in efflux rate.\nThese data confirm the existence of a saturable myocardial uptake mechanism for idarubicin and might provide useful information for optimizing anthracycline dosage regiments.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical research", "date": "2003-03-01", "authors": ["WonkuKang", "MichaelWeiss"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1022246708326"}

The auxiliary alpha(2)delta-subunit regulates calcium current density and activation/inactivation kinetics when co-expressed with some, but not all, alpha(1)-subunits. Here we report the differential expression of three alpha(2)delta-subunit cDNAs in rat atria, atrial myocytes and ventricle, and demonstrate that IGF-1 selectively increases the expression of the alpha(2)delta-3 mRNA in the atria. mRNA encoding the alpha(2)delta-1- and alpha(2)delta-2-subunits, but not the alpha(2)delta-3-subunit, is detected in the rat ventricle whereas all three transcripts are found in atrial tissue. Analysis of the rat alpha(2)delta-1 cDNA sequence indicates that the atria express the alpha(2)delta-1e alternatively spliced isoform of this gene. The complete cDNA sequences of the alpha(2)delta-2- and alpha(2)delta-3-subunits from rat atria were determined and found to share 96% and 95% identity, respectively, with their counterparts in mouse. Treatment of acutely cultured atrial myocytes with IGF-1 caused a significant increase of the amount of alpha(2)delta-3, but not alpha(2)delta-1 or alpha(2)delta-2, mRNA.

Moreover, post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) of cardiac cells could almost completely protect the mitochondrial respiration against the inhibitory effect of methylglyoxal. A systematic search indicated that creatine present in cardiac cells is responsible for this protective effect. Glutathione has also some protective effect. However, creatine phosphate, creatinine, urea, glutathione disulphide and beta-mercaptoethanol have no protective effect. The inhibitory and protective effects of methylglyoxal and creatine respectively on cardiac mitochondrial respiration were studied with various concentrations of both methylglyoxal and creatine. Interestingly, neither creatine nor glutathione have any protective effect on the inhibition by methylglyoxal on the mitochondrial respiration of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells. The creatine and glutathione contents of several PMS, which were tested for the possible protective effect, were measured. The activities of two important enzymes, namely glyoxalase I and creatine kinase, which act upon glutathione plus methylglyoxal and creatine respectively, were also measured in different PMS. Whether mitochondrial creatine kinase had any role in the protective effect of creatine had also been investigated using 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, an inhibitor of creatine kinase.

The expression of CYP2F1 is highly tissue-selective; the highest expression is observed in the lung with little or no hepatic expression. The objective of these studies was to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the unique tissue-specific regulation of CYP2F1. Cosmid and bacterial artificial chromosome clones were screened and sequenced to identify a gene that spanned 14 kbp containing 10 exons, including an untranslated exon 1. Primer extension analysis and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to identify the transcription start site. Several sequences homologous to known cis-elements were identified in the 5'-upstream region of the CYP2F1 promoter. Transient transfection studies with luciferase reporter constructs demonstrated a significant functional lung cell-specific CYP2F1 promoter region (from position -129 to +115). DNase footprinting analysis of 1.6 kbp of the upstream sequence with nuclear extracts from human lung tissues revealed one strong DNA-protein complex at -152 to -182. This nuclear protein (called lung-specific factor, LSF) was present only in lung but not liver or heart tissues. Competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays characterized a DNA consensus site, within the LSF-binding domain, that was highly similar to two E box motifs, but no known \"E box\" trans-factors were identified.

Although much has been reported regarding diagnosis, gross morphology and surgical treatment, no information on gene expression in HLHS myocytes is available.\nWe examined heart tissue from patients with HLHS using routine histology, immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and protein identification by mass spectrometry.\nHistologic examination of right and left ventricles from HLHS patients revealed characteristic features of myocyte differentiation, including striations and intercalated disc formation. Immunohistochemical staining using antibody to N-cadherin demonstrated clear development of intercalated discs between myocytes. However, many of the myocytes contained scant cytoplasm and were grouped in small, disorganized bundles separated by abundant connective tissue and dilated, thin-walled vessels. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that both left and right ventricular tissue from HLHS hearts expressed the fetal or \"heart failure\" gene expression pattern. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by mass spectrometry also confirmed that myocytes from HLHS ventricles were differentiated but expressed the fetal isoform of some cardiac specific proteins. However, HLHS myocytes in all of the heart samples (n=21) were inappropriately expressing platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, CD31), a member of the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) family that has a primary role in the regulation of tissue morphogenesis.

{"title": "Assessment of the CTNNA3 gene encoding human alpha T-catenin regarding its involvement in dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Alpha T-catenin is a novel member of the alpha-catenin family, which shows most abundant expression in cardiomyocytes and in peritubular myoid cells of the testis, pointing to a specific function for alpha T-catenin in particular muscle tissues. Like other alpha-catenins, alpha T-catenin provides an indispensable link between the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion complex and the cytoskeleton, to mediate cell-cell adhesion. By isolating genomic clones, combined with database sequence analysis, we have been able to determine the structure of the CTNNA3 and Ctnna3 genes, encoding human and mouse alpha T-catenin, respectively. The positions of the exon-exon boundaries are completely conserved in CTNNA3, Ctnna3, and the alpha N-catenin encoding CTNNA2 gene. They overlap largely with the boundaries of the CTNNA1 and CTNNAL1 genes encoding alpha E-catenin and alpha-catulin, respectively. This emphasizes that these alpha-catenin genes evolved from the same ancestor gene. Nevertheless, the introns of CTNNA3 and Ctnna3 are remarkably large (often more than 100 kb) compared with introns of other CTNNA genes. The CTNNA3 gene was mapped to chromosome band 10q21 by both fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase-chain-reaction-based hybrid mapping. This region encodes a gene for autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a common cause of morbidity and mortality. As alpha T-catenin is highly expressed in healthy heart tissue, we have considered CTNNA3 as a candidate disease gene in a family showing DCM linkage to the 10q21-q23 locus.

Only in children, however, has atrioventricular (AV) block after cisapride been reported. This study used Langendorff perfusion to determine the direct effects of cisapride (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 microM) on the conduction properties of neonatal (<7 d) and adult (>3 mo) rabbit hearts. At a clinically relevant dose (0.03 microM), cisapride slowed the recovery of the His-Purkinje system. At 0.1 microM, the refractoriness of the His-Purkinje system and conduction through this system were prolonged. Corrected QT intervals and the ventricular refractory period were also lengthened. These parameters were significantly more prolonged in neonates than in adults. The level of AV block at rapid atrial pacing shifted from the AV node to the His-Purkinje system, with an ED(50) of 0.06 and 0.52 microM in the neonate and the adult, respectively. In the neonate, cisapride even resulted in infranodal AV block rhythm (ED50 = 0.12 microM), but this was not the case in the adult. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia after cisapride was induced in one in seven neonates (14%;, 0.1 microM) and in one in seven adults (14%; 0.03 microM). It is concluded that cisapride may affect the refractoriness of cardiac tissue and that the His-Purkinje system seems to be the most sensitive. In neonatal hearts, this modification may, in fact, progress to infranodal AV block. Such susceptibility to cisapride strongly indicates that the therapeutic safety range used for the young heart should be narrowed.", "journal": "Pediatric research", "date": "2003-02-22", "authors": ["Mei-HwanWu", "Ming-JaiSu", "Selma Siu-ManSun"], "doi": "10.1203/01.PDR.0000050122.67091.1D"}

Co-incubation of dexamethasone with an anti-annexin-1 antibody did not attenuate the suppression of NOS2 mRNA.

However, at that time, it was not evaluated if this accumulation originated from protein synthesized in cartilage or in bone cells because both coexist in skeletal structures of higher vertebrates and Xenopus. Later reports showed that MGP also accumulated in costal calcified cartilage as well as at sites of heart valves and arterial calcification. Interestingly, MGP was also found to accumulate in vertebra of shark, a cartilaginous fish. However, to date, no information is available on sites of MGP expression or accumulation in teleost fishes, the ancestors of terrestrial vertebrates, who have in their skeleton mineralized structures with both bone and calcified cartilage. To analyze MGP structure and function in bony fish, MGP was acid-extracted from the mineralized matrix of either bone tissue (vertebra) or calcified cartilage (branchial arches) from the bony fish, Argyrosomus regius, separated from the mineral phase by dialysis, and purified by Sephacryl S-100 chromatography. No MGP was recovered from bone tissue, whereas a protein peak corresponding to the MGP position in this type of gel filtration was obtained from an extract of branchial arches, rich in calcified cartilage. MGP was identified by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the resulting protein sequence was used to design specific oligonucleotides suitable to amplify the corresponding DNA by a mixture of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 5'rapid amplification of cDNA (RACE)-PCR. In parallel, ArBGP (bone Gla protein, osteocalcin) was also identified in the same fish, and its complementary DNA cloned by an identical procedure. Tissue distribution/accumulation was analyzed by Northern blot, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. In mineralized tissues, the MGP gene was predominantly expressed in cartilage from branchial arches, with no expression detected in the different types of bone analyzed, whereas BGP mRNA was located in bone tissue as expected. Accordingly, the MGP protein was found to accumulate, by immunohistochemical analysis, mainly in the extracellular matrix of calcified cartilage. In soft tissues, MGP mRNA was mainly expressed in heart but in situ hybridization, indicated that cells expressing the MGP gene were located in the bulbus arteriosus and aortic wall, rich in smooth muscle and endothelial cells, whereas no expression was detected in the striated muscle myocardial fibers of the ventricle. These results show that in marine teleost fish, as in mammals, the MGP gene is expressed in cartilage, heart, and kidney tissues, but in contrast with results obtained in Xenopus and higher vertebrates, the protein does not accumulate in vertebra of non-osteocytic teleost fish, but only in calcified cartilage. In addition, our results also indicate that the presence of MGP mRNA in heart tissue is due, at least in fish, to the expression of the MGP gene in only two specific cell types, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, whereas no expression was found in the striated muscle fibers of the ventricle. In light of these results and recent information on expression of MGP gene in these same cell types in mammalian aorta, it is likely that the levels of MGP mRNA previously detected in Xenopus, birds, and mammalian heart tissue may be restricted to regions rich in smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Our results also emphasize the need to re-evaluate which cell types are involved in MGP gene expression in other soft tissues and bring further evidence that fish are a valuable model system to study MGP gene expression and regulation.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2003-02-06", "authors": ["D CSimes", "M KWilliamson", "J BOrtiz-Delgado", "C S BViegas", "P APrice", "M LCancela"], "doi": "10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.2.244"}

This study evaluated the effects of L-arginine (NO precursor) or nitroglycerine (NO donor) on cardiac and lung function after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in neonatal lambs.\nThree groups of anesthetized lambs underwent cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (120 minutes at 18 degrees C), and rewarming (40 minutes). During reperfusion, L-arginine (5 mg/kg per minute), nitroglycerine (2 microg/kg per minute), or saline (control group) was infused for 100 minutes. All animals were separated from cardiopulmonary bypass and observed for 3 additional hours. Preload recruitable stroke work, cardiac index, pulmonary vascular resistance, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, and lung compliance plasma nitrate/nitrite levels (NO metabolites) were measured before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Malondialdehyde in heart tissue and lung tissue was measured 3 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass.\nRecovery of preload recruitable stroke work and cardiac index were significantly higher in the L-arginine and nitroglycerine groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). Pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly lower in the L-arginine and nitroglycerine groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). Levels of NO metabolites and issue malondialdehyde did not differ among groups.\nL-arginine and nitroglycerine improved recovery of left ventricular function and reduced pulmonary vascular resistance after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The mechanism of beneficial action could involve increased NO levels, but we did not find higher levels of NO metabolites compared with controls.

A cDNA encoding the chicken MnSOD (cMnSOD) has been isolated from a chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell cDNA library. The cloned cMnSOD is 1102 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 224 amino acids that includes a 26-amino-acid 5'-proximal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). The mature 198-amino-acid region of the cMnSOD is highly conserved among various mammalian species. Two cMnSOD mRNA species (1.2 and 1.0 kb) were expressed in most of the tissues and organs analyzed, with the highest expression levels found in brain, kidney, and heart tissues. Compared to earlier stages of development, expression of cMnSOD was highest in day 13 embryonic heart tissue, and was maintained until post-hatch. Exogenously introduced cMnSOD-GFP fusion constructs (which included the MTS) clearly accumulated in the mitochondria of chicken cells, as expected. Surprisingly, the cMnSOD MTS signal, which displays little similarity to mammalian MTS sequences, enabled cMnSOD-GFP fusion proteins to target mitochondria not only from different cell types (fibroblastic and epithelial), but from a number of mammalian species (human, mouse, and pig). This suggests that specific amino acid motifs within the MTS domain may be more important than the overall sequence similarities for mitochondrial targeting.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2003-01-16", "authors": ["Byung-WhiKong", "HyunggeeKim", "Douglas NFoster"], "doi": "10.1016/s0167-4781(02)00593-6"}
{"title": "Polycystin-2 interacts with troponin I, an angiogenesis inhibitor.", "abstract": "Polycystin-2 (PC2), encoded by the PKD2 gene, is mutated in 10-15% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients. PC2 is a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel and is present in kidney and many other organs. Likewise, PKD2-mutated patients and mice exhibit extrarenal abnormalities. In comparison with cysts in the kidney, liver, and pancreas, abnormalities in the heart, brain, and vascular vessels are less understood. In particular, roles of PC2 in muscle and endothelia remain largely unknown. In the present study, using a yeast two-hybrid screening, we discovered that the PC2 carboxyl terminal domain (D682-V968) interacts with the cardiac troponin I, an important regulatory component of the actin microfilament in cardiac muscle cells. This interaction was demonstrated by GST pull-down and microtiter binding assays. Dose-dependent binding between PC2 and troponin I followed a Michaelis-Menten relationship, indicating a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. The interacting domains were located to the R872-H927 segment of PC2 and the M1-V107 and K106-L158 segments of troponin I. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the cardiac and two skeletal isoforms of troponin I were all associated with PC2, when coexpressed in mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells and Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation verified the interaction between the native polycystin-2 and troponin I in human adult heart tissues. This study thus provides new evidence for a direct attachment of PC2 to the actin microfilament network, in addition to the recently identified association between PC2 and trypomyosin-1. Troponin I functions as an inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex for calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction and as an inhibitor of angiogenesis seen in ADPKD. It is possible that altered interaction due to pathogenic polycystin-1 or -2 mutations can account for angiogenesis in ADPKD and may be corrected to some extent by exogenous troponin I.", "journal": "Biochemistry", "date": "2003-01-15", "authors": ["QiangLi", "Patrick YShen", "GuanqingWu", "Xing-ZhenChen"], "doi": "10.1021/bi0267792"}

Release of ET-1 from endocardial endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes can modulate heart tissue necrosis and alterations. This study investigates the remodeling processes in Sprague-Dawley rats of myocardial infarction (MI) induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Histological studies were done on cell type distribution using cell specific markers and Western blot analysis to localize ET-1 receptor subtypes and assess their expression post-MI. In addition, the binding kinetics of ET-1 with its receptors in heart perfusion, inlet via the aortic lumen and effluent outlet via the right atrium, between two animal model-subgroups were done: (1) sham-operated, and sham-operated-CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate)-treated; and (2) MI-operated, and MI-operated-CHAPS-treated. Effluent ET-1 concentration was plotted vs. time using a physical model for 1:1 ligand-receptor binding at coronary endothelium and myocytes. First order impulse function was used to calculate the affinity constants. In MI hearts, fluorescence activity increased for ET(A) vs. ET(B) across areas of the muscle compared to normal hearts. Western blotting showed upregulation of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in MI compared with normal hearts. Results of ET-1 binding affinity post-MI indicated drastic reduction in spite the upregulation of ET(B) on coronary endothelium. Furthermore, substantial affinity increase was observed between ET-1 binding with ET(A) at the myocyte site.

Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (60 days old) were used: one group was untreated as a control; the other groups were treated with DXR (single i.p. dosage of 20 mg kg(-1) body wt.) or DXR plus erdosteine (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1), orally), respectively. The DXR treatment without erdosteine increased antioxidant enzyme activities and also increased lipid peroxidation in myocardial tissue. The rats treated with DXR plus erdosteine produced a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation in comparison with control and DXR groups. Furthermore, erdosteine administration led to an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities in comparison with the control group. Erdosteine treatment also increased the activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in comparison with the DXR group. There was no significant difference in lipid peroxidation of myocardial tissue between control and DXR plus erdosteine-treated rats.

{"title": "Copper deficiency: A potential model for determining the role of mitochondria in cardiac aging.", "abstract": "Heart mitochondria experience age-related declines in cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity and increases in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may contribute to loss of cardiac function and the development of disease that occur with advancing age. In a manner similar to aging, copper deficiency also suppresses heart CCO activity and has cardiovascular consequences related to increased peroxidation. Food restriction is often used as a tool to study oxidative mechanisms of aging and the present study examines the potential of copper deficiency to model the role of mitochondria in cardiac aging by determining if the effect of food restriction on CCO activity and oxidative stress in heart mitochondria parallels its effect on cardiac mitochondria during aging. Overall, copper deficiency severely inhibited CCO activity and increased both Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in isolated heart mitochondria. However, a 20% reduction in food intake by copper-deficient rats increased CCO activity by 65% and decreased MnSOD activity by 25% but had no effect in rats fed adequate copper. Copper deficiency also reduced the carbonyl content of 80-100 kDa mitochondrial proteins, but the reduction in carbonyl content was unaffected by food restriction. Food restriction did, however, completely prevent the enlargement of cardiac mitochondria in copper-deficient rats. Together, these findings indicate that copper deficiency induces mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme activity and hypertrophy in cardiac tissue in response to reduced CCO activity and that food restriction may counteract these changes by reducing oxidative stress. Because the action of food restriction on CCO activity and mitochondrially generated oxidative stress are similar in copper deficiency and aging, copper deficiency may serve as a short-term model for studying the potential roles of mitochondria in cardiac aging.", "journal": "Journal of the American Aging Association", "date": "2003-01-01", "authors": ["W ThomasJohnson", "Samuel MNewman"], "doi": "10.1007/s11357-003-0003-x\n10.1016/0020-711X(81)90122-1\n10.1016/0891-5849(93)90139-L\n10.1006/abbi.1996.0375\n10.1016/S0014-5793(97)00264-0\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00244-2\n10.1139/cjpp-78-10-848\n10.1016/0955-2863(92)90088-Z\n10.1016/0003-2697(85)90442-7\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1974.tb03714.x\n10.1016/0891-5849(94)90169-4\n10.1083/jcb.25.2.407\n10.1006/abbi.1993.1325\n10.1016/0047-6374(94)90104-X\n10.1016/S0014-5793(97)01393-8\n10.1207/S15327914NC3601_7\n10.1016/S0891-5849(98)00195-6\n10.1007/BF02917460"}

In the present study we investigated the effect of L-tryptophan (1.25 microM to 5 mM) and other metabolites of L-kynurenine as 3-hydroxykynurenine (1.25 microM to 2.5 mM), anthranilic acid (1.25 microM to 5 mM) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (1.25 microM to 5 mM) on the heart mitochondria function. Mitochondria were incubated with saturating concentrations of respiratory substrates glutamate/malate (5 mM), succinate (10 mM) or NADH (1 mM) in the presence or absence of L-tryptophan metabolites. Among tested substances, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and anthranilic acid but not tryptophan affected the respiratory parameters dose-dependently, however at a high concentration, of a micro molar range. 3-Hydroxykynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid lowered respiratory control index and ADP/oxygen ratio in the presence of glutamate/malate and succinate but not with NADH. While, anthranilic acid reduced state III oxygen consumption rate and lowered the respiratory control index only of glutamate/malate-consuming heart mitochondria. Co-application of anthranilic acid and kynurenic acid (125 or 625 microM each) to glutamate/malate-consuming heart mitochondria caused a non-additive deterioration of the respiratory parameters determined predominantly by kynurenic acid. Accumulated data indicate that within L-tryptophan metabolites kynurenic acid is the most effective, followed by anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid to influence the respiratory parameters of heart mitochondria.

{"title": "The functional role of the JAK-STAT pathway in post-infarction remodeling.", "abstract": "Recently, the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway was found to be prominently associated with activation of the autocrine loop of the heart tissue-localized renin angiotensin system (RAS). We investigated if the JAK-STAT pathway is activated in the post-myocardial infarction (MI) non-ischemic myocardium (NIM), destined to undergo remodeling and whether blockade of the pathway in vivo can modify early post-MI remodeling.\nWe investigated the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-STAT and gp130 proteins in the NIM of post-MI rat heart as well as the binding activity of STAT proteins to the St-domain of the angiotensinogen gene promoter. We further compared the effects of in vivo blockade of RAS by the AT(1) receptor (AT(1)R) blocker losartan with the in vivo blockade of JAK-STAT pathway by the specific JAK2 blocker tyrphostin AG490 on certain aspects of early post-MI remodeling.\nWe showed that JAK2, STATs 1, 3, 5a and 6 and gp130 proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated as early as 5-30 min post-MI and that STATs 1, 3, and 5a remain activated up to 7 days post-MI. Gel mobility shift assay showed a strong binding activity of STAT proteins to the St-domain of angiotensinogen gene promoter in 1-day post-MI NIM. The binding was significantly reduced in rat hearts previously treated with losartan or tyrphostin AG490. Supershift experiments identified STATs 3 and 5a as specifically interacting with the St-domain. Both AT(1)R and JAK2 blockade resulted in significant amelioration of the increase of protein phosphatase 1 activity and decrease in basal level of p16-phospholamban that may underlie early diastolic dysfunction, as well as partial amelioration of early downregulation of Kv4.2 gene expression that may underlie increased arrhythmogenicity of 3-day post-MI heart. On the other hand, while blockade of AT(1)R significantly ameliorated apoptotic changes in 1-day post-MI border zone, blockade of JAK2 increased apoptosis.\nThe study provides compelling evidence in favor of the linkage of the JAK-STAT pathway with the angiotensin II autocrine loop and uncovers a mechanism by which selective activation of a set of STAT proteins underlies mobilization of the gene activation program intrinsic to post-MI remodeling. It also suggests that drugs that inhibit JAK-STAT phosphorylation may provide a new approach to modify post-MI remodeling.

{"title": "Voltage-gated sodium channels as primary targets of diverse lipid-soluble neurotoxins.", "abstract": "Voltage-gated Na(+) channels are heteromeric membrane glycoproteins responsible for the generation of action potentials. A number of diverse lipid-soluble neurotoxins, such as batrachotoxin, veratridine, aconitine, grayanotoxins, pyrethroid insecticides, brevetoxins and ciguatoxin, target voltage-gated Na(+) channels for their primary actions. These toxins promote Na(+) channel opening, induce depolarization of the resting membrane potential, and thus drastically affect the excitability of nerve, muscle and cardiac tissues. Poisoning by these lipid-soluble neurotoxins causes hyperexcitability of excitable tissues, followed by convulsions, paralysis and death in animals. How these lipid-soluble neurotoxins alter Na(+) channel gating mechanistically remains unknown. Recent mapping of receptor sites within the Na(+) channel protein for these neurotoxins using site-directed mutagenesis has provided important clues on this subject.

Tissue engineering represents another promising approach that makes possible the creation of new functional tissues to replace the lost or failing one. Three-dimensional polymeric scaffolds provide the mechanical support for the candidate cells until the formation of cardiac-like tissue prior to surgical repair of the infarcted myocardium. For ultimate clinical applications, further investigations have to select the appropriate cell types, to determine the sufficient number of grafted cells and to provide the long term evaluation of these strategies in the global improvements of cardiac function (neoangiogenesis, synchronous contraction and extracellular matrix remodelling).", "journal": "Biorheology", "date": "2002-11-28", "authors": ["NguyenTran", "YanLi", "SylvieBertrand", "S\u00e9bastienBangratz", "Jean-PierreCarteaux", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisStoltz", "Jean-PierreVillemot"], "doi": null}
{"title": "A mathematical study of volume shifts and ionic concentration changes during ischemia and hypoxia.", "abstract": "The response of tissue to ischemia (cessation of blood flow and deprivation of oxygen) includes swelling of the intracellular space, shrinkage of the extracellular space, and an increase in the extracellular potassium concentration. The responses of cardiac and brain tissue to ischemia are qualitatively different in that cardiac tissue shows a rise in extracellular potassium over several minutes from about 5 to 10-12 mM followed by a plateau, while brain tissue shows a similar initial rise followed by a very rapid increase in extracellular potassium to levels of 50-80 mM. During hypoxia the flow of blood (or perfusate) is maintained and, while there is a substantial efflux of potassium from cells, there is little accumulation of potassium in the interstitium. A mathematical model is proposed and studied to try to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the increase in extracellular potassium, and the different time courses seen in neural and cardiac tissue. The model involves a Hodgkin-Huxley-type description of transmembrane ion currents, allows for ion concentrations as well as volumes to change for both the intracellular and extracellular space, and includes coupling of damaged tissue to nearby healthy tissue. The model produces a response to ischemia much like that seen in neural tissue, and the mechanism underlying this response in the model is determined. The same mechanism is not present in cardiac ion models, and this may explain the qualitative difference in response shown in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2002-11-28", "authors": ["Chung SeonYi", "Aaron LFogelson", "James PKeener", "Charles SPeskin"], "doi": "10.1006/jtbi.2003.3154"}
{"title": "BMP signaling is required for septation of the outflow tract of the mammalian heart.", "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) constitute a family of approximately 20 growth factors involved in a tremendous variety of embryonic inductive processes. BMPs elicit dose-dependent effects on patterning during gastrulation and gradients of BMP activity are thought to be established through regulation of the relative concentrations of BMP receptors, ligands and antagonists. We tested whether later developmental events also are sensitive to reduced levels of BMP signaling. We engineered a knockout mouse that expresses a BMP type II receptor that lacks half of the ligand-binding domain. This altered receptor is expressed at levels comparable with the wild-type allele, but has reduced signaling capability. Unlike Bmpr2-null mice, mice homozygous for this hypomorphic receptor undergo normal gastrulation, providing genetic evidence of the dose-dependent effects of BMPs during mammalian development. Mutants, however, die at midgestation with cardiovascular and skeletal defects, demonstrating that the development of these tissues requires wild-type levels of BMP signaling. The most striking defects occur in the outflow tract of the heart, with absence of septation of the conotruncus below the valve level and interrupted aortic arch, a phenotype known in humans as persistent truncus arteriosus (type A4). In addition, semilunar valves do not form in mutants, while the atrioventricular valves appear unaffected. Abnormal septation of the heart and valve anomalies are the most frequent forms of congenital cardiac defects in humans; however, most mouse models display broad defects throughout cardiac tissues. The more restricted spectrum of cardiac anomalies in Bmpr2(deltaE2) mutants makes this strain a key murine model to understand the embryonic defects of persistent truncus arteriosus and impaired semilunar valve formation in humans.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2002-11-21", "authors": ["Emmanu\u00e8le CD\u00e9lot", "Matthew EBahamonde", "ManxuZhao", "Karen MLyons"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.00181"}
{"title": "Expression and functional characterization of SCaMPER: a sphingolipid-modulated calcium channel of cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Calcium channels are important in a variety of cellular events including muscle contraction, signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis. Sphingolipids have been recognized as mediators of intracellular calcium release through their actions on a calcium channel, sphingolipid calcium release-mediating protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (SCaMPER). The current study investigates the expression and function of SCaMPER in cardiomyocytes. Northern analyses and RT-PCR cloning and sequencing revealed SCaMPER expression in both human and rat cardiac tissue. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses demonstrated that SCaMPER is abundant in cardiac tissue and is localized to the sarcotubular junction. This was confirmed by the colocalization of SCaMPER with dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors by confocal microscopy. Purified T tubules were shown to contain SCaMPER and immunoelectron micrographs suggested that SCaMPER is located to the junctional T tubules, but a junctional SR localization cannot be ruled out. The sphingolipid ligand for SCaMPER, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), initiated calcium release from the cardiomyocyte SR. Importantly, antisense knockdown of SCaMPER mRNA produced a substantial reduction of sphingolipid-induced calcium release, suggesting that SCaMPER is a potentially important calcium channel of cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Alterations in apoptotic signaling in human idiopathic cardiomyopathic hearts in failure.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis, is associated with heart failure and compensatory hypertrophy. Although cell and animal models suggest a role for altered gene expression in the transition to heart failure, there is a paucity of data derived from the study of human heart tissue. In this study, we used DNA microarray profiling to investigate changes in the expression of genes involved in apoptosis that occur in human idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathic hearts that had progressed to heart failure. We observed altered gene expression consistent with a proapoptotic shift in the TNF-alpha signaling pathway. Specifically, we found decreased expression of TNF-alpha- and NF-kappaB-induced antiapoptotic genes such as growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (GADD)45beta, Flice inhibitory protein (FLIP), and TNF-induced protein 3 (A20). Consistent with a role for apoptosis in heart failure, we also observed a significant decrease in phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112. This study identifies several pathways that are altered in human heart failure and provides new targets for therapy.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Reentry in heterogeneous cardiac tissue described by the Luo-Rudy ventricular action potential model.", "abstract": "Heterogeneity of cardiac tissue is an important factor determining the initiation and dynamics of cardiac arrhythmias. In this paper, we studied the effects of gradients of electrophysiological heterogeneity on reentrant excitation patterns using computer simulations. We investigated the dynamics of spiral waves in a two-dimensional sheet of cardiac tissue described by the Luo-Rudy phase 1 (LR1) ventricular action potential model. A gradient of action potential duration (APD) was imposed by gradually varying the local current density of K(+) current or inward rectifying K(+) current along one axis of the tissue sheet. We show that a gradient of APD resulted in spiral wave drift. This drift consisted of two components. The longitudinal (along the gradient) component was always directed toward regions of longer spiral wave period. The transverse (perpendicular to the gradient) component had a direction dependent on the direction of rotation of the spiral wave. We estimated the velocity of the drift as a function of the magnitude of the gradient and discuss its implications.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Caveolin-1 null mice develop cardiac hypertrophy with hyperactivation of p42/44 MAP kinase in cardiac fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Recently, development of a caveolin-1-deficient (Cav-1 null) mouse model has allowed the detailed analysis of caveolin-1's function in the context of a whole animal. Interestingly, we now report that the hearts of Cav-1 null mice are markedly abnormal, despite the fact that caveolin-1 is not expressed in cardiac myocytes. However, caveolin-1 is abundantly expressed in the nonmyocytic cells of the heart, i.e., cardiac fibroblasts and endothelia. Quantitative imaging studies of Cav-1 null hearts demonstrate a significantly enlarged right ventricular cavity and a thickened left ventricular wall with decreased systolic function. Histological analysis reveals myocyte hypertrophy with interstitial/perivascular fibrosis. Because caveolin-1 is thought to act as a negative regulator of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade, we performed Western blot analysis with phospho-specific antibodies that only recognize activated ERK1/2. As predicted, the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade is hyperactivated in Cav-1 null heart tissue (i.e., interstitial fibrotic lesions) and isolated cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels are dramatically upregulated. Thus loss of caveolin-1 expression drives p42/44 MAP kinase activation and cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.
