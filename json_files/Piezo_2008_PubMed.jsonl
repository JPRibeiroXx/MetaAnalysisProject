Different formulation components at various concentrations were screened for their effects on growth, cell size, and recovery on membrane filters. An optimized broth, Glucose Hydrolysate Broth, containing glucose, polypeptone, bovine serum albumin, 2-Amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (Tris base), oleic acid, and palmitic acid produced small 370 X 406 nanometer monodisperse cells at titers in excess of 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu mL(-1)) within 20-24 h of incubation.

The shear-mechanical spectra are obtained by the piezoelectric shear-modulus gauge (PSG) method. This technique allows one to measure the shear modulus (10(5)-10(10) Pa) of the liquid within a frequency range from 1 mHz to 10 kHz. We analyze the frequency-dependent response functions to investigate whether time-temperature superposition (TTS) is obeyed. We also study the shear-modulus loss-peak position and its high-frequency part. It has been suggested that when TTS applies, the high-frequency side of the imaginary part of the dielectric response decreases like a power law of the frequency with an exponent -1/2. This conjecture is analyzed on the basis of the shear mechanical data. We find that TTS is obeyed for pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane and in 1,2-propanediol while in the remaining liquids evidence of a mechanical beta process is found. Although the high-frequency power law behavior w(-alpha) of the shear loss may approach a limiting value of alpha = 0.5 when lowering the temperature, we find that the exponent lies systematically above this value (around 0.4). For the two liquids without beta relaxation (pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane and 1,2-propanediol) we also test the shoving model prediction, according to which the relaxation time activation energy is proportional to the instantaneous shear modulus.

Due to the high organizational state of fractal structures of MRET polymer compounds and the phenomenon of piezoelectricity, this polymer generates specific subtle, low frequency, non-coherent electromagnetic oscillations (optimal random field) that can affect the hydrogen lattice of the molecular structure of water and subsequently modify the electrodynamic properties of water.

The present study describes a simple and robust droplet generator based on a piezoelectric actuator which is integrated into a microfluidic device. The droplet generator is able to independently control the droplet size, rate of formation and distance between droplets. Moreover, the droplet uniformity is especially high, deviating from the mean value by less than 0.3%. The cross flow and T-junction configurations are tested and show no significant differences, yet the inlet to main channel ratio is found to be important. As this ratio increases, droplets tend to be generated in bursts instead of individually. The physical mechanisms involved are discussed, providing insight into optimized design of such systems.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2009-02-05", "authors": ["AvishayBransky", "NatanelKorin", "MariaKhoury", "ShulamitLevenberg"], "doi": "10.1039/b814810d"}

{"title": "Effective mixing of laminar flows at a density interface by an integrated ultrasonic transducer.", "abstract": "An acoustic mixer for glass channel microfluidic systems is presented. An acoustic standing wave, perpendicular to the fluid flow, is generated by the excitation of a miniaturized piezoelectric transducer operated around 10 MHz. The transducer is fabricated into a planar printed circuit board structure, constituting the bottom channel wall, which makes the mixer simple to integrate with a wide selection of microfluidic channel designs. The mixing occurs at a fluid-fluid density interface due to the acoustic radiation force; an analytical expression is derived to qualitatively describe this phenomenon. Only a small density difference in the range of 2-5% is required to achieve 150-270% peak broadening of a fluorescent sample between sheath flows, which we use as a measure of the mixing efficiency.

A simple and rapid sample preparation method used was by passing urine samples through a 0.22 microm PVDF syringe filter.

Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between oocyte morphology and both embryo development and pregnancy outcome. In the present study, we compared the morphology of oocytes with subsequent development of human somatic cell NT (SCNT) embryos.\nPiezo-assisted SCNT technology was used to produce reconstructed embryos, with almost 92% of oocytes reconstructed successfully. Depending on their morphologies, we separated metaphase II oocytes into four grades according to criteria which assess oocyte morphology, first polar body and perivitelline space, and especially, cytoplasm granula distribution.\nEmbryos from oocytes of Grades A and B could develop to the blastocyst stage with similar development efficiency for every developmental stage. However, embryos from Grade C oocytes arrested at or before the 8-cell stage then degraded, and the donor cell genome could not be activated and reprogrammed in such oocytes. For Grade D oocytes, cleavage was not observed in the reconstructed embryos, suggesting that the oocytes themselves have no developmental potential.\nOur study revealed that different levels of developmental competence of SCNT embryos resulting from different oocyte reprogramming potentials associated with different morphologies.

The performance of the array elements at either end of the array can differ from that of array elements away from the ends. There is some general understanding about the origin of these effects (such as different acoustic impedance), and some standard compensatory designs exist (such as adding unused array elements further on the end than the last used array element). This work seeks to elucidate the origins of these end-element anomalies and to propose corresponding design changes. A commercially produced array with notable end-element anomalies is examined as a case study. Results from experiments and finite element analysis indicate that, in the presence of a stiffness discontinuity within the composite (such as poled elements adjacent to unpoled ones), a secondary wave that propagates laterally through the composite may be generated during the receive transduction. This wave appears to cause the anomalous behavior observed in the signals and metrics of the end elements. Changing the electrical loading of an element and poling the unused, previously unpoled elements are explored as anomaly-mitigating design alterations.

Element capacitance varied from 30 to over 400 pF depending on element size and PZT thickness. Smaller element sizes generally produced higher acoustic transmit output as well as higher frequency than larger elements. Thicker PZT layers also produced higher transmit output per unit electric field applied.

{"title": "On the dynamics of piezoactuated positioning systems.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) are commercially available for producing extremely small displacements. If a PEA is used to drive a positioning mechanism, the combined dynamics is approximated empirically by that of a second-order system. However, the rationale for such an approximation is lacking in the literature, thus leaving some issues unaddressed, such as the scope of and the error associated with the approximation. This paper presents such a rationale for the second-order approximation and a method to quantify the error associated with the approximation, by employing the assumed mode method to solve the governing equation. For the experimental verification, step voltages of 48.2, 64.2, and 75.4 V were used to excite a prototype of the positioning system with a mass ratio of 24.7, 47.7, 87.5, 115.8, and 138.8, respectively; and the measured system step responses were compared to the ones simulated by using the second-order approximation.

The first part of the paper treats the PFA model, which is comprised of a piezoelectric slightly curved composite beam derived using Hamilton's principle. In the latter part of the paper, the distributed transfer function method is applied to evaluate the transfer function formulation of the cantilevered PFA associated with its boundary conditions. This method will be used to resolve the radial displacements and natural frequencies of the PFA in an exact and closed-form solution, which is validated by in situ fiber optic curvature sensing measurements. The theoretical model predicted the natural frequencies of the first- and second-mode responses of the experimental quite accurately. For a cyclical low-field input, the field-induced displacement appears approximately linear, which seems comparable to the theoretical prediction and reflects primarily the converse piezoelectric effect. A cyclical high-field butterfly-shaped displacement behavior is also analogous to the behavior predicted by the model in that it demonstrates the range of validity of the linear converse piezoelectric effect without consideration of the ferroelectric domain switch effect.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2008-12-03", "authors": ["KenSusanto"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3020697"}

The shear-mechanical data are obtained using the piezoelectric shear-modulus gauge method covering frequencies from 1 mHz to 10 kHz. The shear-mechanical relaxation spectra show two processes, which follow the typical scenario of a structural (alpha) relaxation and an additional (Johari-Goldstein) beta relaxation. The dielectric relaxation spectra are dominated by a Debye-type peak with an additional non-Debye peak visible. This Debye-type relaxation is a common feature peculiar to monoalcohols. The time scale of the non-Debye dielectric relaxation process is shown to correspond to the mechanical structural (alpha) relaxation. Glass-transition temperatures and fragilities are reported based on the mechanical alpha relaxation and the dielectric Debye-type process, showing that the two glass-transition temperatures differ by approximately 10 K and that the fragility based on the Debye-type process is a factor of 2 smaller than the structural fragility. If a mechanical signature of the Debye-type relaxation exists in these liquids, its relaxation strength is at most 1% and 3% of the full relaxation strength of 2-butanol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, respectively.

The ISTTOK microwave interferometer is a heterodyne system with quadrature detection and a probing frequency of 100 GHz (lambda(0)=3 mm). In this paper, a low-cost approach for real-time diagnostic using a digital signal programmable intelligent computer embedded system is presented, which allows the measurement of the phase with a 1% fringe accuracy in less than 6 micros. The system increases its accuracy by digitally correcting the offsets of the input signals and making use of a judicious lookup table optimized to improve the nonlinear behavior of the transfer curve. The electron density is determined at a rate of 82 kHz (limited by the analog to digital converter), and the data are transmitted for each millisecond although this last parameter could be much lower (around 12 micros--each value calculated is transmitted).

The system comprises of integrated control electronics and microelectromechanical system devices such as micropump, micro blood pressure sensor and microneedle array. The objective is to overcome the limitations of oral therapy such as variable absorption profile and the need for frequent dosing, by fabricating a safe, reliable and cost effective transdermal drug delivery system to dispense various pharmacological agents through the skin for treatment of hemodynamic dysfunction such as hypertension. Moreover, design optimization of a piezoelectrically actuated valveless micropump is presented for the drug delivery system. Because of the complexity in analysis of piezoelectric micropump, which involves structural and fluid field couplings in a complicated geometrical arrangement, finite element (FE) numerical simulation rather than an analytical system has been used. The behavior of the piezoelectric actuator with biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane membrane is first studied by conducting piezoelectric analysis. Then the performance of the valveless micropump is analyzed by building a three dimensional electric-solid-fluid model of the micropump. The effect of geometrical dimensions on micropump characteristics and efficiency of nozzle/diffuser elements of a valveless micropump is investigated in the transient analysis using multiple code coupling method. The deformation results of the membrane using multifield code coupling analysis are in good agreement with analytical as well as results of single code coupling analysis of a piezoelectric micropump. The analysis predicts that to enhance the performance of the micropump, diffuser geometrical dimensions such as diffuser length, diffuser neck width and diffuser angle need to be optimized. Micropump flow rate is not strongly affected at low excitation frequencies from 10 to 200 Hz. The excitation voltage is the more dominant factor that affects the flow rate of the micropump as compared with the excitation frequency. However, at extremely high excitation frequencies beyond 8,000 Hz, the flow rate drops as the membrane exhibits multiple bending peaks which is not desirable for fluid flow. Following the extensive numerical analysis, actual fabrication and performance characterization of the micropump is presented. The performance of the micropump is characterized in terms of piezoelectric actuator deflection and micropump flow rate at different operational parameters. The set of multifield simulations and experimental measurement of deflection and flow rate at varying voltage and excitation frequency is a significant advance in the study of the electric-solid-fluid coupled field effects as it allows transient, three dimensional piezoelectric and fluid analysis of the micropump thereby facilitating a more realistic multifield analysis.

First, a large increase in the active surface area and packing density of neutravidin enhances the maximum neutravidin load to 1.8 times of a normal electrode.

Currently, there are no experimental investigations on the ballistic background of these devices.\nAn experimental test set-up was designed for measurement of the firing pressure and the dynamic force of the gas jet of a vole captive bolt device. Therefore, a vole captive bolt device was prepared with a pressure take-off channel and a piezoelectric transducer for measurement of the firing pressure. For measurement of the dynamic impact force of the gas jet an annular quartz force sensor was installed on a test bench. Each three simultaneous measurements of the cartridges' firing pressure and the dynamic force of the blast wave were taken at various distances between muzzle and load washer.\nThe maximum gas pressure in the explosion chamber was up to 1100 bar. The shot development over time showed a typical gas pressure curve. Flow velocity of the gas jet was up to 2000 m/s.

The distraction was performed using the same distraction system in all cases, but with the osteotomy performed either by conventional techniques using rotary instruments and chisels (conventional osteotomy group, n = 11), or by piezoelectric osteotomy using the Piezosurgery system (Mectron Medical Technology; Carasco, Genoa, Italy; n = 6).

{"title": "Occurrence and composition of extracellular lipids and polysaccharides in a full-scale membrane bioreactor.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to characterize the polysaccharides and lipid fractions of membrane foulants in a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating municipal wastewater. Both of these polymeric compounds are major components of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and are impacting membrane fouling; however most of the data so far have been collected by determining sum parameters rather than the detailed composition of these polymers. Photometric analysis of sugars showed that uronic acids (glucuronic, mannuronic and galacturonic acid) as common units of bacterial polysaccharides accounted for 8% (w/w) of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in activated sludge flocs. Further the so-called polysaccharide peak of EPS, with a molecular weight >10 kDa according to size exclusion chromatography, was proven to contain bacterial sugar units as shown by high resolution LC-MS. Interestingly, only traces of uronic acids could be detected in EPS of the membrane fouling layer. A far more dramatic enrichment in the fouling layer was revealed for the lipid fraction of EPS, which was determined as fatty acid methyl esters by GC-MS. The weight percentage of fatty acids in EPS extracted from fouled ultrafiltration membranes was much higher (10%) than in the activated sludge itself (1-3%). The fatty acids accumulated on the membrane fouling layer were obviously not only of microbial origin (C16:0, C18:0) but also derived from the raw wastewater itself (C9:0). Hydrophobic interaction of lipids with the PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane material therefore seems a plausible explanation for the observed fouling phenomenon. The results suggest that fatty acids from bacterial lipopolysaccharides as well as from synthetic sources are of much higher relevance to membrane fouling than previously assumed.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2008-11-11", "authors": ["DjamilaAl-Halbouni", "WolfgangDott", "JulianeHollender"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2008.10.008"}

In such a structure, propagation is allowed only in the gap between the film and the wall surface, and the wave propagates in the axial direction of the cylinder. The radiation impedance of the cylindrical transducer inside the concentric wall has been calculated using a one-dimensional propagation model. After calculating the mechanical impedance of the cylindrical PVDF film, the generated acoustic wave has been calculated as a function of frequency with various air gaps between the PVDF film and the wall. It has been found that the excited acoustic wave becomes stronger for a narrower air gap and shows a maximum at a specific air gap. This phenomenon has been explained as the match between the transducer impedance and the radiation impedance of the air gap. When the gap is too small, the radiation impedance exceeds the transducer's mechanical impedance, the acoustic wave radiation decreases with the decreasing gap, and the resonance frequency increases due to loading by the imaginary part of the excessive radiation impedance.

The acoustic transmission loss through the curved membrane was measured for the incident sound of frequency 1.6 kHz and of acoustic pressure level 80 dB. When the negative capacitor in the system was properly adjusted, the acoustic pressure level of the transmitted sound was reduced from the initial 60 dB to 15 dB by the action of the negative capacitor. Then the system was exposed to naturally changing operational conditions, and their effect on sound-shielding efficiency was studied. It is shown that the acoustic transmission loss of the system dropped by 35 dB within 30 min from the moment of negative capacitor adjustment. Therefore, a self-adjustment of the system has been implemented by appending an additional digital control circuit to the negative capacitor.

The slider can be levitated and moved using acoustic radiation force and acoustic streaming. The slider has a simple configuration and consists of an aluminum vibrating plate and a piezoelectric zirconate titanate (PZT) element. The large asymmetric vibration distribution for the high thrust and levitation performance was obtained by adjusting the configuration determined by finite elemental analysis (FEA). As a preliminary step, the computed results of the sound pressure distribution in the 1-mm air gap by FEA was com pared with experimental results obtained using a fiber optic probe. The direction of the total driving force for the acoustic streaming in the small air gap was estimated by the sound pressure distribution calculated by FEA, and it was found that the direction of the acoustic streaming could be altered by controlling the vibration mode of the slider. The flexural standing wave could be generated along the vibrating plate near the frequencies predicted based on the FEA results. The slider could be levitated by the acoustic radiation force radiated from its own vibrating plate at several frequencies. The slider could be moved in the negative and positive directions at 68 kHz and 69 kHz, which correspond to the results computed by FEA, with the asymmetric vibration distribution of the slider's vibrating plate.

The PZT transducers are usually surface bonded to or embedded in a structure and subjected to actuation so as to interrogate the structure at the desired frequency range. The interrogation results in the electromechanical admittance (inverse of EMI) signatures which can be used to estimate the structural health or integrity according to the changes of the signatures. In the existing EMI method, the monitored structure is only excited by the PZT transducers for the interrogating of EMI signature, while the vibration of the structure caused by the external excitations other than the PZT actuation is not considered. However, many structures work under vibrations in practice. To monitor such structures, issues related to the effects of vibration on the EMI signature need to be addressed because these effects may lead to misinterpretation of the structural health.

{"title": "Single-transducer dual-frequency ultrasound generation to enhance acoustic cavitation.", "abstract": "Dual- or multiple-frequency ultrasound stimulation is capable of effectively enhancing the acoustic cavitation effect over single-frequency ultrasound. Potential application of this sonoreactor design has been widely proposed such as on sonoluminescence, sonochemistry enhancement, and transdermal drug release enhancement. All currently available sonoreactor designs employed multiple piezoelectric transducers for generating single-frequency ultrasonic waves separately and then these waves were mixed and interfered in solutions. The purpose of this research is to propose a novel design of generating dual-frequency ultrasonic waves with single piezoelectric elements, thereby enhancing acoustic cavitation. Macroscopic bubbles were detected optically, and they were quantified at either a single-frequency or for different frequency combinations for determining their efficiency for enhancing acoustic cavitation. Visible bubbles were optically detected and hydrogen peroxide was measured to quantify acoustic cavitation. Test water samples with different gas concentrations and different power levels were used to determine the efficacy of enhancing acoustic cavitation of this design. The spectrum obtained from the backscattered signals was also recorded and examined to confirm the occurrence of stable cavitation. The results confirmed that single-element dual-frequency ultrasound stimulation can enhance acoustic cavitation. Under certain testing conditions, the generation of bubbles can be enhanced up to a level of five times higher than the generation of bubbles in single-frequency stimulation, and can increase the hydrogen peroxide production up to an increase of one fold. This design may serve as a useful alternative for future sonoreactor design owing to its simplicity to produce dual- or multiple-frequency ultrasound.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2008-10-28", "authors": ["Hao-LiLiu", "Chao-MingHsieh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2008.08.009"}

The present article briefly discusses the principle and structure of the system, and introduces its unique characteristic. The system consists of probe unit, XY scanner, Z-piezo feedback system, computer and software, fiber optic spectrometer, anodization control circuitry etc. When a white light beam illuminates the surface of the film, the reflective light beams at the front and back side of the layer are coherent, and lead to periodical amplifications and extinction in the reflective spectrum with the information of the optical thickness of the film. A fiber optic spectrometer was applied in the system which input the refractive spectrum into the computer by which the optical thickness of the film was calculated. Meanwhile according to the surface topography of PA films by AFM in liquid, the effective refractive index was calculated based on Maxwell-Garnett theory and coherent potential approximation (CPA). So the thickness of PA films could be gained at last. To checkout the feasibility and stability of the system, the real-time scanning and thickness measurement experiments were done during anodization of Al sheets in oxalic acid aqueous solution. In the experiment, the authors used 25 mm diameter aluminum (Al) sheets with 99.999% purity and 0.4 mm thickness as the anode, and graphite rod as the cathode. The pretreatment-cleaned Al sheets were anodized in an aqueous solution of 0.5 mol x L(-1) oxalic acid at the constant temperature (20 +/- 0.2) degrees C with 20 mA x cm(-2) anodization electronic current density. Real-time AFM images of PA film were successfully obtained during anodization. The pore-ratios of Al sheet were 7.81% and 13.83% at oxidizing time 150 min and 180 min respectively. Correspondingly, the effective indexes were calculated to be 1.62 and 1.60, respectively. Combining the reflective spectrum gained by the fiber optic spectrometer, the wave number differences between the two adjacent extrema were 57.69 mm(-1) and 50.00 mm(-1). Based on reflectometric interference spectroscopy, the thickness of PA films was found to be 5.35 and 6.25 microm with oxidizing time 150 min and 180 min respectively.

First to 6th-grade primary school children (394 subjects; 201 boys and 193 girls) walked with pedometers on an outdoor 50-m course, and the measured values were compared with actual steps at 3 speeds: normal, slow, and fast paces.

In the normal- and fast-pace walking, the counts by spring-levered pedometer were significantly lower than the actual steps in all grades excluding the 5th grade. Moreover, the spring-levered pedometer underestimated by 25% or more in all grades at slow pace. In contrast, the percent error of the counts by the piezo-electric pedometers at normal pace were mostly within +/-3%, confirming their high accuracy.

The presence of induced motion artifact and any noise was removed after signal digitization by noise cancellation. Besides fixed weighting, two adaptive algorithms were used for cancellation-LMS and differential steepest descent (DSD). Criteria were developed for comparison of the adaptive techniques. The best fixed weighting for noise cancellation was w=0.6. For fixed-weighting, LMS, and DSD, the mean peak-to-peak errors were 1.22+/-0.54, 1.18+/-0.30, and 1.16+/-0.23 V, respectively, and the mean point-to-point errors were 15.86+/-3.15, 11.40+/-1.96, and 10.13+/-1.25 V, respectively.

{"title": "Local Dynamic Stability Assessment of Motion Impaired Elderly Using Electronic Textile Pants.", "abstract": "A clear association has been demonstrated between gait stability and falls in the elderly. Integration of wearable computing and human dynamic stability measures into home automation systems may help differentiate fall-prone individuals in a residential environment. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the capability of a pair of electronic textile (e-textile) pants system to assess local dynamic stability and to differentiate motion-impaired elderly from their healthy counterparts. A pair of e-textile pants comprised of numerous e-TAGs at locations corresponding to lower extremity joints was developed to collect acceleration, angular velocity and piezoelectric data. Four motion-impaired elderly together with nine healthy individuals (both young and old) participated in treadmill walking with a motion capture system simultaneously collecting kinematic data. Local dynamic stability, characterized by maximum Lyapunov exponent, was computed based on vertical acceleration and angular velocity at lower extremity joints for the measurements from both e-textile and motion capture systems. Results indicated that the motion-impaired elderly had significantly higher maximum Lyapunov exponents (computed from vertical acceleration data) than healthy individuals at the right ankle and hip joints. In addition, maximum Lyapunov exponents assessed by the motion capture system were found to be significantly higher than those assessed by the e-textile system. Despite the difference between these measurement techniques, attaching accelerometers at the ankle and hip joints was shown to be an effective sensor configuration. It was concluded that the e-textile pants system, via dynamic stability assessment, has the potential to identify motion-impaired elderly.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on automation science and engineering : a publication of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society", "date": "2008-10-01", "authors": ["JianLiu", "Thurmon ELockhart", "MarkJones", "TomMartin"], "doi": "10.1109/TASE.2008.923821"}

The materials KNbW 2O 9, RbNbW 2O 9, and KTaW 2O 9 were synthesized by standard solid-state techniques and structurally characterized by laboratory powder X-ray diffraction. The compounds are isostructural, crystallizing in the polar NCS space group Cmm2. The materials exhibit a corner-shared MO 6 (M = Nb (5+)/W (6+) or Ta (5+)/W (6+)) octahedral framework, with K (+) or Rb (+) occupying the \"hexagonal\" tunnels. The d (0) transition metals, Nb (5+), Ta (5+), and W (6+), are displaced from the center of their oxide octahedra attributable to second-order Jahn-Teller effects. SHG measurements using 1064 nm radiation revealed frequency-doubling efficiencies ranging from 180 to 220 x alpha-SiO 2. Converse piezoelectric measurements resulted in d 33 values ranging from 10 to 41 pm V (-1). The total pyroelectric coefficient, p, at 50 degrees C ranged from -6.5 to -34.5 muC K (-1) m (-2). The reported materials are also ferroelectric, as demonstrated by hysteresis loops (polarization vs electric field). Spontaneous polarization values, P s, ranging from 2.1 to 8.4 muC cm (-2) were measured. The magnitudes of the SHG efficiency, piezoelectric response, pyroelectric coefficient, and ferroelectric polarization are strongly dependent on the out-of-center distortion of the d (0) transition metals.

The mechanical stabilizers used for local suppression of the heart excursion have been demonstrated to exhibit significant residual motion, which could lead to a lack of accuracy in performing the surgical task, particularly when using a minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach. We therefore propose a novel active stabilizer to compensate for the residual motion whose architecture is compatible with MIS.

This system enables withdrawing micropumping by acoustic radiation in microchannels. The withdrawing configuration, integrated on chip, is here quantitatively investigated for the first time, and found to be related to the formation and coalescence dynamics of droplets within the microchannel, primed by surface acoustic waves. The growth dynamics of droplets is governed by the water diffusion on LiNbO(3), determining the advancement of the fluid front. Observed velocities are up to 2.6 mm s(-1) for 30 dBm signals applied to the interdigital transducer, corresponding to tens of nl s(-1), and the micropumping dynamics is described by a model taking into account an acoustic power exponentially decaying upon travelling along the microchannel.

{"title": "A soft-polymer piezoelectric bimorph cantilever-actuated peristaltic micropump.", "abstract": "A peristaltic micropump was fabricated and characterized. The micropump was fabricated using soft lithography, and actuated using piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers. The micropump channel was formed by bonding two layers of PDMS, mixed at 5:1 and 30:1 ratios. The channel was fabricated in the 5:1 layer using replica molding (REM), where a very simple and inexpensive template was made by straddling a 75 microm wire over a glass substrate, followed by covering and smoothing over the wire with a piece of aluminium foil. Not only was this template inexpensive and extremely simple to fabricate, it also created a rounded cross-sectional geometry which is favorable for complete valve shutoff. The cantilevers were driven at Vp=+/-90 V with amplified square wave signals generated by a virtual function generator created in LabVIEW. Connections to the micropump were made by placing capillary tubes in the channel, and then sealed between the two layers of PDMS. Machined aluminium clamps were adhered to the tips of the cantilevers with general purpose adhesive. These clamps allowed for aluminium valves, with finely machined tips of dimensions 3 mm by 200 microm, to be held firmly in place. The variables characterized for this micropump were flow rate, maximum attainable backpressure, free cantilever deflection, valve shutoff, and valve leakage. Three actuation patterns with phase differences of 60, 90, and 120 degrees were compared for flow rate and maximum backpressure. It was determined that the 120 degrees signal outperformed the 60 degrees and 90 degrees signals for both maximum flowrate and maximum attainable backpressure. The maximum and minimum flowrates demonstrated by the micropump were 289 nL min(-1) and 53 nL min(-1), respectively. The maximum backpressure attained was 35 300 Pa. It was also demonstrated that the valves fully closed the channels upon actuation, with minimal observed leakage.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2008-09-25", "authors": ["Neil JGraf", "Michael TBowser"], "doi": "10.1039/b805252b"}

Purified streptolysin O (SLO) purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Sigma-SLO), SLO antigen as a latex agglutination reagent from A company (A-SLO) and supernatants from four culture media were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunological analyses of antibodies against SLO in healthy sera and proteins in culture medium demonstrated that healthy sera contained an antibody recognizing Sigma-SLO, A-SLO and a protein of the same size as SLO (SLO-like protein) in culture medium. These findings suggest that healthy subjects develop an antibody directed against SLO-like protein produced by non-pathogenic streptococci, and that this antibody cross-reacts with Sigma-SLO and A-SLO. Using DNA from Streptococcus pyogenes and non-pathogenic streptococci, the SLO gene and SLO-like protein gene were analyzed by direct sequencing with oligonucleotide primers designed to cover no. 74 to approximately 1900 of the SLO gene. There were three different bases resulting in amino acid substitution between the SLO gene and SLO-like protein gene, namely 101Lys (AAA) of SLO to Asn (AAT), 175Met (ATG) to Arg (AGG) and 185Asp (GAT) to Asn (AAT). Remaining 560 residues of 563 amino acids constituting SLO-like protein were homologous to SLO. Non-pathogenic streptococci on the pharynges of healthy subjects produce an SLO-like protein composed of amino acids similar to those of SLO, which induces an antibody against this SLO-like protein in serum.

{"title": "Artificial fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection in a teleost fish, the medaka (Oryzias latipes).", "abstract": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a technique that has been successfully used for assisting reproduction in mammals. However, this method is still not reliable in nonmammalian species, including teleosts. We succeeded in producing medaka individuals by ICSI with a rate of 13.4% (28 hatched embryos out of 209 eggs fertilized by ICSI), the best value reported so far in teleosts, including zebrafish and Nile tilapia. Although the technique was based on that developed for mammalian eggs, some critical modifications were made to adjust it to the medaka egg, which has a thick and hard envelope (the chorion) and a single sperm entry site (the micropyle). Medaka ICSI was performed by injecting a demembranated spermatozoon into an egg cytoplasm through the micropyle 10-15 sec after egg activation induced by a piezo-actuated vibration, the site and timing of sperm penetration being consistent with those in normal fertilization in medaka. To increase the efficiency of ICSI in medaka, we found that the fertilization by ICSI should precisely mimic the fertilization by insemination with intact sperm, both spatially and temporally. The success rate of ICSI was highly variable in batches of eggs (ranging from 0% to 56%), suggesting that the conditions of eggs are important factors in stabilizing the production of individuals by ICSI. The success in medaka ICSI provides a basis for future research to understand the basic mechanisms in gamete biology of teleosts as well as for development of new technology that can yield valuable applications in fisheries science.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2008-09-05", "authors": ["SatoshiOtani", "ToshiharuIwai", "ShingoNakahata", "ChiharuSakai", "MasakaneYamashita"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.108.069880"}

{"title": "Sea-going hardware for the cloud albedo method of reversing global warming.", "abstract": "Following the review by Latham et al. (Latham et al. 2008 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 366) of a strategy to reduce insolation by exploiting the Twomey effect, the present paper describes in outline the rationale and underlying engineering hardware that may bring the strategy from concept to operation. Wind-driven spray vessels will sail back and forth perpendicular to the local prevailing wind and release micron-sized drops of seawater into the turbulent boundary layer beneath marine stratocumulus clouds. The combination of wind and vessel movements will treat a large area of sky. When residues left after drop evaporation reach cloud level they will provide many new cloud condensation nuclei giving more but smaller drops and so will increase the cloud albedo to reflect solar energy back out to space. If the possible power increase of 3.7W m-2 from double pre-industrial CO2 is divided by the 24-hour solar input of 340W m-2, a global albedo increase of only 1.1 per cent will produce a sufficient offset. The method is not intended to make new clouds. It will just make existing clouds whiter. This paper describes the design of 300 tonne ships powered by Flettner rotors rather than conventional sails. The vessels will drag turbines resembling oversized propellers through the water to provide the means for generating electrical energy. Some will be used for rotor spin, but most will be used to create spray by pumping 30 kgs-1 of carefully filtered water through banks of filters and then to micro-nozzles with piezoelectric excitation to vary drop diameter. The rotors offer a convenient housing for spray nozzles with fan assistance to help initial dispersion. The ratio of solar energy reflected by a drop at the top of a cloud to the energy needed to make the surface area of the nucleus on which it has grown is many orders of magnitude and so the spray quantities needed to achieve sufficient global cooling are technically feasible.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

{"title": "In-process assessment of dental cutting of a leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic.", "abstract": "This paper reports an in-process assessment of the dental cutting of a leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic with a high-speed dental handpiece under clinical operating conditions. The dental cutting was performed using a computer-controlled 2-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) testing regime and a coarse diamond bur of 106-125 microm grit size. Dynamic forces were monitored during the cutting process using a piezoelectric force dynamometer and a data acquisition system in both time and frequency domains. Bur speeds were found to decrease with the depth of cut and with the feed rate, by a maximum of 10.5% from the free-running speed of 322.2 krpm (1 krpm=1,000 rpm) to 288.4 krpm at the highest feed rate of 60mm/min and depth of cut of 50 microm. Both the tangential and normal forces increased with the depth of cut and the feed rate, in the ranges of 0.24-1.77 N and 0.60-2.93 N respectively. The torque increased with the depth of cut and feed rate. The specific cutting energy generally decreased with the depth of cut or the feed rate with the exception of a small-scale fluctuation at the higher depth of cut and feed rate.

{"title": "Development and validation of an electrogoniometric wrist alignment device.", "abstract": "This paper reports the development of an instrumented flexible electrogoniometric hand posture corrective device designed specifically for monitoring and controlling the range of motion (ROM) at the hand and wrist. The device, known as the wrist alignment device (WAD), consists of flexible electrogoniometers attached to a Lycra glove and a control box housing the WAD circuitry. The WAD controls the wrist ROM within set limits by means of presetting the joint angle ranges prior to commencing measurements, thereby preventing or reducing extreme wrist ulnar deviation, wrist hyperflexion, and wrist hyperextension. Additionally, the device consists of a window comparator, which allows the joint movement always to remain within the set limits. Where the subject's wrist ROM is outside the presettings, a piezo-buzzer is triggered which alerts the subject to reduce the ROM, thereby ensuring that the joint angles are always kept within the preset angle range. All instrumentation associated with the development of the device underwent calibration. As a device, it has widespread applications within the office and clinical environment. Preliminary results indicate that reliable measurements based on ROM settings can be obtained when using the WAD.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

{"title": "Affinity of functional groups for membrane surfaces: implications for physically irreversible fouling.", "abstract": "Fouling in membranes used for water treatment has been attributed to the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) in water. There have been reports recently on the contribution of hydrophilic fractions of NOM (e.g., carbohydrate-like substances) to fouling, but there is still little information about the physicochemical interactions between membranes and carbohydrate-like substances. In this study, the affinity of carbohydrate-like substances to two different microfiltration (MF) membranes was investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and functionally modified microspheres. Microspheres were attached to the tip of the cantilever in an AFM apparatus and the adhesion forces working between the microspheres and the membranes were determined. The microspheres used in this study were coated with either hydroxyl groups or carboxyl groups to be used as surrogates of carbohydrate-like substances or humic acid, respectively. Measurements of adhesion force were carried out at pH of 6.8 and the experimental results demonstrated that the adhesion force to membranes was strong in the case of hydroxyl groups but weak in the case of carboxyl groups. The strong adhesion between the hydroxyl group and the membrane surface is explained by the strong hydrogen bond generated. It was also found that the affinity of the hydroxyl group to a polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) membrane was much higher than that to a polyethylene (PE) membrane, possibly due to the high electronegative nature of the PVDF polymer. The time course of changes in the affinity of hydroxyl group to a membrane used in a practical condition was investigated by repeatedly carrying out AFM force measurements with PE membrane specimens sampled from a pilot plant operated at an existing water treatment plant. Microspheres exhibited strong affinity to the membrane at the initial stage of operation (within 5 days), but subsequently exponential reduction of the affinity was seen until the end of operation, as a result of fouling development. However, the magnitude of affinity of hydroxyl-modified microspheres was much higher than that of carboxyl-modified microspheres even after the significant reduction of affinity of hydroxyl-modified microspheres to the membranes was seen. The results obtained in this study partially explain why hydrophilic NOM dominated over humic substances in foulants of membranes used for water treatment in recent studies on fouling.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2008-08-30", "authors": ["HiroshiYamamura", "KatsukiKimura", "TakaharuOkajima", "HiroshiTokumoto", "YoshimasaWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1021/es800406j"}

{"title": "Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A165b (VEGF-A165b) are elevated in experimental glaucoma.", "abstract": "Although ischemia has previously been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucoma, neovascularization is not implicated in glaucoma. Because vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is a key mediator in neovascularization response, we investigated the levels of the major pro-angiogenic (VEGF-A164) and anti-angiogenic VEGF-A subtypes (VEGF-A165b) in the retina during experimental glaucoma.\nGlaucoma was induced unilaterally in rats by injecting 1.9 M hypertonic saline solution in the episcleral veins. The contralateral eye served as the control. The intraocular pressure (IOP) of each eye was measured via Tonopen in conscious rats. Eyes were enucleated either on the 5th or the 10th day of elevated IOP. Whole retinal lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Levels of VEGF-A164 and VEGF-A165b were analyzed by western blotting using specific antibodies. In a different group of rats, retinal ganglion cells were retrogradely labeled by injecting Fluorogold in the superior colliculus a week before the induction of glaucoma. After the eyes were enucleated on the fifth day of elevated IOP, posterior eye cups were sectioned using a cryostat. Levels and localization of VEGF-A164 and VEGF-A165b were examined in retinal sections by immunohistochemistry.\nVEGF-A164 levels remained unchanged between the control and glaucomatous retinas after five days (p=0.341) and 10 days of elevated IOP (p=0.117). The presence of the anti-angiogenic VEGF-A isoform has not been previously reported in the rat. An antibody specific to VEGF-A165b detected the anti-angiogenic protein in the rat retina. VEGF-A165b levels were significantly increased (2.33+/-0.44 fold, p=0.014) in the glaucomatous retinas compared to those in controls after five days of elevated IOP. VEGF-A165b levels were not different (p=0.864) between the control and glaucomatous retinas following 10 days of elevated IOP. Expression of both VEGF-A164 and VEGF-A165b were observed in the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and inner nuclear layer (INL).\nFive day elevation of IOP leads to an increase in the anti-angiogenic VEGF-A165b levels but not in the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A164 levels in the glaucomatous retina. VEGF-A165b levels return to baseline after 10 days of elevated IOP, and VEGF-A164 levels remain unchanged. We speculate that the short-term elevation of VEGF-A165b levels and/or the unchanged levels of VEGF-A164 contribute to the lack of neovascularization in the glaucomatous retina.", "journal": "Molecular vision", "date": "2008-08-30", "authors": ["CerenErgorul", "ArjunRay", "WeiHuang", "DianeDarland", "Zhonghui KLuo", "Cynthia LGrosskreutz"], "doi": null}

The entire device is fully packaged by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin layer. The PFW has Schottky contacts at its two ends but with distinctly different barrier heights. The I- V characteristic is highly sensitive to strain mainly due to the change in Schottky barrier height (SBH), which scales linear with strain. The change in SBH is suggested owing to the strain induced band structure change and piezoelectric effect. The experimental data can be well-described by the thermionic emission-diffusion model.

{"title": "Simultaneous sensing and actuation with a piezoelectric tube scanner.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric tube scanners with quartered external electrodes are the most widely used nanopositioning technology in modern scanning probe microscopes. There has been increasing interest in utilizing feedback control techniques to improve bandwidth and accuracy of these nanopositioners. The use of feedback requires a sensor to be incorporated into the nanopositioning device. Noncontact displacement sensors, e.g., capacitive and inductive sensors, have been used for this purpose. However, their measurements contain a significant noise component if operated over large bandwidths. The piezoelectric voltage induced in a tube nanopositioner has been proposed recently as an alternative measure of displacement with a much improved noise figure, up to three orders of magnitude better than capacitive sensors. In this arrangement, an electrode is used to actuate the tube, while the opposite electrode is used as a sensor. This approach has two drawbacks: (i) the operating range of the tube is reduced to half and (ii) the tube is not driven symmetrically, thus the opposite sides of the tube experience asymmetric stresses, i.e., in this mode of operation, the scanner is not a perfectly collocated system. In this paper, we present a new electrode pattern for piezoelectric tube scanners which addresses the above problems and allows simultaneous sensing and actuation of the tube in an efficient way.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2008-08-07", "authors": ["S O RezaMoheimani", "Yuen KYong"], "doi": "10.1063/1.2952506"}

This paper describes the design and validation of a custom-built, controlled-strain, linear, simple-shear rheometer system capable of direct empirical measurements of viscoelastic shear properties at phonatory frequencies. A tissue specimen was subjected to simple shear between two parallel, rigid acrylic plates, with a linear motor creating a translational sinusoidal displacement of the specimen via the upper plate, and the lower plate transmitting the harmonic shear force resulting from the viscoelastic response of the specimen. The displacement of the specimen was measured by a linear variable differential transformer whereas the shear force was detected by a piezoelectric transducer. The frequency response characteristics of these system components were assessed by vibration experiments with accelerometers. Measurements of the viscoelastic shear moduli (G' and G\") of a standard ANSI S2.21 polyurethane material and those of human vocal fold cover specimens were made, along with estimation of the system signal and noise levels. Preliminary results showed that the rheometer can provide valid and reliable rheometric data of vocal fold lamina propria specimens at frequencies of up to around 250 Hz, well into the phonatory range.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2008-08-07", "authors": ["Roger WChan", "Maritza LRodriguez"], "doi": "10.1121/1.2946715\n10.1121/1.1387094\n10.1121/1.1736272\n10.1121/1.427947\n10.1121/1.428354\n10.1114/1.1561287\n10.1121/1.2173516\n10.1097/00005537-199906000-00001\n10.1121/1.1631941\n10.1121/1.2749460"}

The present work concentrates on the application of time reversal to the focusing of audible range, flexural waves in an infinite beam, and to the detection of local heterogeneity in such a beam. Practical applications of time reversal of flexural waves in structures include vibration energy focusing, detection of vibratory or acoustic sources, and detection of defects in mechanical structures. An analytical model of flexural wave propagation in the beam as well as sensing and emission using piezoelectric transducers is presented. Time reversal experiments are conducted and compared to the model results in either a homogeneous beam or a beam with point mass heterogeneities. In the various situations tested, it is shown that time reversal effectively compensates the spreading in time of the impulse due to the dispersive propagation of flexural waves. One interesting aspect of this property is the generation of large amplitude impulsive responses in the beam using remote actuators.

A conventional polyurethane tube was incubated for 24 to 96 h in the mixed flora of isolated bacteria, and the optimal incubation conditions to simulate a clinically formed biofilm were determined by observation with a scanning electron microscope. Biofilm formation on a PVDF-coated tube was observed using this in vitro model, and the adherence of different bacterial species to conventional and PVDF-coated tubes was assessed. Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Acinetobacter haemolytics, and Methylobacterium mesophilicum were predominantly isolated from contaminated DUWLs.

Subjects consisted of 10 healthy male adults. Following tactile stimulation of 6 sites on the oral mucosa (inferior/superior buccal mucosa, posterior/anterior tongue mucosa, and upper/lower lip mucosa), SEFs with a peak latency of 15 ms (1M) were identified bilaterally. In contrast, SEFs with a peak latency of 30 ms following right index finger tactile stimulation were identified only in the contralateral hemisphere. Equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) generating 15 ms components were found along the posterior wall of the central sulcus, bilaterally. The ECD locations for oral mucosa-representing areas were located inferiorly to those for the index finger, with the following pattern of organization from top to bottom along the central sulcus: index finger, upper or lower lip, anterior or posterior tongue and superior or inferior buccal mucosa, with a wide distribution, covering 30% of the S1 cortex. Source strength for 1M in the ipsilateral hemisphere was weaker than that in the contralateral hemisphere. These results clearly indicate that sensory afferents innervating the intraoral region project to both the contralateral and ipsilateral 3b areas via the trigeminothalamic tract, where contralateral projection is predominant.

One potential way to increase the safety of therapeutic biological products is the use of a virus-retentive filter. In order to increase the viral safety of human antihemophilic factor IX, particularly in regard to non-enveloped viruses, virus removal process using a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter (Viresolve NFP) has been optimized. The most critical factor affecting the filtration efficiency was operating pH and the optimum pH was 6 or 7. Flow rate increased with increasing operating pressure and temperature. Recovery yield in the optimized production-scale process was 96%. No substantial changes were observed in the physical and biochemical characteristics of the filtered factor IX in comparison with those before filtration. A 47-mm disk membrane filter was used to simulate the process performance of the production-scale cartridges and to test if it could remove several experimental model viruses for human pathogenic viruses, including human hepatitis A virus (HAV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), murine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine herpes virus (BHV).

We generated different polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) surfaces including (i) a smooth surface of PVDF spherulites as a control, (ii) a randomly nanotextured surface with alumina particles, and (iii) a microstructure using laser ablation. The identical chemistry of all PVDF surfaces was demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The topography was evaluated by white light interferometry and X-profile analysis. Macrophages were cultured on the different surfaces including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment as an inflammatory activator. Our results demonstrate that the microstructured surface but not the nanotexured significantly affects the activation of primary human macrophages by inducing a specific cytokine and gene expression pattern. This activation resulted in a subtype of macrophages with pro- but also anti-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, the response on the topography differed from that triggered by LPS, pointing to a different activation state of the cells. Our data clearly show that a particular topography induces an inflammatory response.

The purpose of this research was to study whether bacteria inside kidney stones can be inactivated by shockwaves.\nA series of infected artificial kidney stones were exposed in vitro to either 90 or 400 shockwaves using a research electrohydraulic or a commercial piezoelectric lithotripter. Two types of stones (soft and hard) were manufactured by mixing gypsum cement and Vel-mix-stone with water. Half of the stones were inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium.

The acoustic-streaming phenomenon, which results from the fluid motion induced by high-intensity sound waves, can be used to remove these nonspecifically bound proteins to allow more accurate determinations and reuse of these devices. We present a computational and experimental study of the acoustic-streaming phenomenon induced by surface acoustic waves.A coupled-field fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model of a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) device based on a micrometer-sized piezoelectric substrate (YZ-LiNbO3) in contact with a liquid loading was developed to study the surface-acoustic-wave interaction with fluid loading. The fluid domain was modeled using the Navier-Stokes equation; the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach was employed to handle the mesh distortions arising from the motion of the solid substrate. The fluid-solid coupling was established by maintaining stress and displacement continuity at the fluid-structure interface. A transient analysis was carried out by applying a time-varying voltage to the transmitter interdigital transducer (IDT) fingers. Simulation results predict strong coupling of ultrasonic surface waves on the piezoelectric substrate with the thin liquid layer causing wave mode conversion from Rayleigh to leaky SAWs, which leads to acoustic streaming. The transient solutions generated from the FSI model were utilized to predict trends in acoustic-streaming velocity for varying design parameters such as voltage intensity, device frequency, fluid viscosity, and density. The induced streaming velocities typically vary from 1 mum/s to 1 cm/s, with the exact values dictated by the device operating conditions as well as fluid properties. Additionally, the model predictions were utilized to compute the various interaction forces involved and thereby identify the possible mechanisms for removal of nonspecifically bound proteins. Our study indicates that the SAW body force overcomes the adhesive forces of the fouling proteins to the device surface and the fluid-induced drag and lift forces prevent their reattachment. The streaming velocity fields computed using the finite-element model in conjunction with the proposed mechanism were used to identify the conditions leading to improved removal efficiency. Predictions of the model are in good agreement with those of simple analytical theories as well as the experimentally observed trends of nonspecific protein removal in typical SAW biosensing operations.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Acoustic backscatter and effective scatterer size estimates using a 2D CMUT transducer.", "abstract": "Compared to conventional piezoelectric transducers, new capacitive microfabricated ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) technology is expected to offer a broader bandwidth, higher resolution and advanced 3D/4D imaging inherent in a 2D array. For ultrasound scatterer size imaging, a broader frequency range provides more information on frequency-dependent backscatter, and therefore, generally more accurate size estimates. Elevational compounding, which can significantly reduce the large statistical fluctuations associated with parametric imaging, becomes readily available with a 2D array. In this work, we show phantom and in vivo breast tumor scatterer size image results using a prototype 2D CMUT transducer (9 MHz center frequency) attached to a clinical scanner. A uniform phantom with two 1 cm diameter spherical inclusions of slightly smaller scatterer size was submerged in oil and scanned by both the 2D CMUT and a conventional piezoelectric linear array transducer. The attenuation and scatterer sizes of the sample were estimated using a reference phantom method. RF correlation analysis was performed using the data acquired by both transducers. The 2D CMUT results indicate that at a 2 cm depth (near the transmit focus for both transducers) the correlation coefficient reduced to less than 1/e for 0.2 mm lateral or 0.25 mm elevational separation between acoustic scanlines. For the conventional array this level of decorrelation requires a 0.3 mm lateral or 0.75 mm elevational translation. Angular and/or elevational compounding is used to reduce the variance of scatterer size estimates. The 2D array transducer acquired RF signals from 140 planes over a 2.8 cm elevational direction. If no elevational compounding is used, the fractional standard deviation of the size estimates is about 12% of the mean size estimate for both the spherical inclusion and the background. Elevational compounding of 11 adjacent planes reduces it to 7% for both media. Using an experimentally estimated attenuation of 0.6 dB cm(-1) MHz(-1), scatterer size estimates for an in vivo breast tumor also demonstrate improvements using elevational compounding with data from the 2D CMUT transducer.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2008-07-19", "authors": ["WLiu", "J AZagzebski", "T JHall", "E LMadsen", "TVarghese", "M AKliewer", "SPanda", "CLowery", "SBarnes"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/53/15/011"}

This technique consists in placing a test tube, containing the analyzing fluid, between two matched ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers, one used as transmitter and the other as receiver. The transmitter generates an ultrasonic wave in the liquid sample which is received by the receiver; the attenuation and the delay of the received signal in respect to the transmitted one are used to characterize the testing fluid. As first experiments this technique was applied to some test solutions of saccharose in water, ethanol in water and of both solvents in water, in order to evaluate the method applicability and resolution. Best results are obtained by the propagation velocity measurement, with a resolution less than 2%. The method was then applied to monitor the wine fermentation: the propagation velocity in the must was measured every day and the results were related to chemical analyses. The obtained results show that the propagation velocity has the same behaviour of the saccharose concentration, putting in evidence the possibility of monitoring the process state by measuring the ultrasound propagation velocity.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2008-07-19", "authors": ["NLamberti", "LArdia", "DAlbanese", "MDi Matteo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2008.06.003"}

However, there exists a clear correlation between these two properties: nanorods with low piezoelectric response display low resistivity. The relationship is explained by the reduction of the Madelung constant due to free electrons. The results highlight that slight differences in the local environment during synthesis can cause large variation in physical properties found among similar nanostructures. These variations cannot be revealed through ensemble measurements and may contribute to the confusion in the literature of individual nanostructure properties.

They are suitable for applications in structural health monitoring systems (SHM) with acoustic non-destructive testing methods (NDT). In the presented work the transfer behavior of an AFC as an emitter of transient elastic waves in plate-like structures is investigated. The wave field emitted by an AFC surface bonded on an isotropic plate was simulated with the finite-difference method. The model includes the piezoelectric element and the plate and allows the simulation of the elastic wave propagation. For comparison with the model experiments using a laser interferometer for non-contact measurements of particle velocities at different points around the AFC on the surface of the plate were performed. Transfer functions defined as the ratio of the electric voltage excitation signal and the resulting surface velocity at a specific point are separately determined for the two fundamental Lamb wave modes. In order to take the orthotropic behavior of the AFC into account the transfer functions are determined for several points around the AFC. Results show that the AFC is capable to excite the fundamental symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb wave mode. The antisymmetric mode is mainly radiated in the direction of the piezoelectric fibers, while the symmetric mode is spread over a larger angle.

These detailed studies provided important information on the application domain of the artificial membranes investigated. According to the nature of the organic solvent and the composition of the filter, different permeation behaviours were noted. A double permeation pathway was observed for DCE-coated with PVDF filters since hydrophilic compounds permeated the membrane through aqueous pores created by the interaction of DCE and PVDF filters, while the more lipophilic compounds were trapped in the DCE present on filters.

There are, however, two major problems when using such cultured primary neurones for these experiments (1) the almost certain expression of heterogeneous NMDA receptor subunits which could underlie double exponential kinetics due to different potencies at receptor subtypes and (2) slow space- and concentration-clamp due to neuronal morphology which could mask even faster kinetics. Therefore, we performed similar experiments with Xenopus oocytes exclusively expressing one NMDA receptor type (NR1a/2A) at high levels which allowed recordings from membrane patches with large currents. The use of inside-out patches for voltage-step and outside-out patches in combination with a piezo driven fast application system largely negated potential space- and concentration-clamp problems. Block and unblock of the NMDA receptor by memantine after both voltage jump and concentration jumps showed triple exponential kinetics. The fast onset kinetics of NMDA receptor channel block following both concentration-clamp and voltage jumps from +70 to -70 mV were similar. In contrast, offset kinetics after a voltage-step from -70 to +70 mV were much faster than following a concentration jump at the holding potential of -70 mV.

The mathematical model of a composite aircraft fin tip is derived using the finite element approach. The finite element model is updated experimentally to reflect the natural frequencies and mode shapes very accurately. Piezo-electric actuators and sensors are placed at optimal locations such that the vibration suppression is a maximum. Model-reference direct adaptive neural network control scheme is proposed to force the vibration level within the minimum acceptable limit. In this scheme, Gaussian neural network with linear filters is used to approximate the inverse dynamics of the system and the parameters of the neural controller are estimated using Lyapunov based update law. In order to reduce the computational burden, which is critical for real-time applications, the number of hidden neurons is also estimated in the proposed scheme. The global asymptotic stability of the overall system is ensured using the principles of Lyapunov approach. Simulation studies are carried-out using sinusoidal force functions of varying frequency.

A dc voltage calculated from the photodetector output is applied to the light source to control the interferometer at the condition of maximum sensitivity. Then the signal's phase shift can be obtained from the components of zero and fundamental frequencies. To test the method, an all polarization-maintaining Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a piezoelectric ceramic (PbZrTiO(3), or PZT) cylinder in one arm is constructed. The experimental results show that the simulation signal's phase shift generated by the PZT cylinder can be read out correctly with the method. It has the advantages of simplicities of operation, no-active element in the sensing head, and large operating bandwidth.

{"title": "The hypothesis of 'biophysical matrix contraction': wound contraction revisited.", "abstract": "Wound contraction is an orchestrated phenomenon that contributes to closure of wounds that heal by secondary intention. However, excessive and premature contraction results in scarring. Although the exact mechanism of contraction is unknown, the wound closure process is accompanied by and followed by changes in the physical and mechanical properties of the wound and periwound tissues during the biological transformation. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces a contractile phenotype in the cellular-extracellular matrix. Meanwhile, various external and internal mechanical stresses lead to microdeformations of the wound milieu with resultant upregulation of TGF-beta. Furthermore, the mechanical strain exerted on collagen fibres and other piezoelectric tissues leads to development of piezoelectric current in the wound site, which acts synergistically with TGF-beta. TGF-beta and mechanical strain regulate the orientation of collagen fibres parallel with the skin surface, which minimises the induction of piezoelectricity through the action of internal forces because of improper angulation of collagen fibres and these forces. The resulting dominance of external forces guides the contractile activity towards restoration of the original unwounded tissue architecture and functional activity of the previously wounded milieu. The aforementioned contractile activity proceeds into the remodelling phase of wound healing as the level of TGF-beta is reduced and myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis.", "journal": "International wound journal", "date": "2008-07-03", "authors": ["Ramin MostofizadehFarahani", "Luther CKloth"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1742-481X.2007.00402.x"}
{"title": "The use of acoustic radiation forces to position particles within fluid droplets.", "abstract": "Handling of micrometer sizes particles, such as biological cells or coated beads, plays a relevant role in the field of life science. A number of devices have been presented in the last years, in which acoustic forces generated by coupling the vibration of a solid structure excited by a piezoelectric transducer to the particle suspension are used to collect particles in lines or position them in clumps on a grid. Following the trend of lab-on-a-chip devices, efforts have been made to shrink the size of such systems, aiming at less reagent consumption and shorter reaction times. The majority of these systems consist of closed fluid filled volumes, typically channels. Here the use of an open fluid volume, a droplet, is examined. By exciting resonances into the droplet positioned on a surface, particles can be gathered into a line, two parallel lines or, as the frequency of excitation is increased, into more complex patterns.

Although closed-loop control is effective at eliminating non-linearity at low scan speeds, the bandwidth compared to open loop is severely reduced. In addition, sensor noise significantly degrades achievable resolution in closed loop. In this work, charge drives are evaluated as a simple positioning alternative when feedback control cannot be applied or provides inadequate performance. These situations arise in high-speed imaging, where position sensor noise can be large or where no feedback sensors are present. Charge drives can reduce the error caused by hysteresis to less than 1% of the scan range.

{"title": "The effects of complex stapes motion on the response of the cochlea.", "abstract": "The piston-like motion of the stapes footplate is the only effective stimulus to the cochlea, and rocking-like stapes motions have no effect on hearing.\nStudies of the vibration of the stapes in response to acoustic stimulation of the normal ear have revealed a complex movement pattern of its footplate. At low frequencies, the vibrations are predominantly piston-like, but they become increasingly rocking-like at middle and high frequencies. These complex vibrations can be decomposed into a translational, piston-like displacement and 2 rotational movements around the long and short axes of the stapes. The rotational components produce no net volume displacement of the cochlear fluid at some distance from the footplate. Therefore, according to the classic theory of hearing, the rotational motion is not transformed into cochlear activity and a hearing sensation. It was the goal of this study to test this hypothesis experimentally in guinea pigs.\nA piezoelectric 3-axis device was used to vibrate the stapes in various desired directions while simultaneously monitoring the actual motion of the stapes by a 3-dimensional laser Doppler interferometer and the cochlear activity by recording the compound action potential.\nThe collected data of the presented study cannot be explained by the current theory of hearing.\nThe qualitative results provide supportive evidence that complex movements of the stapes footplate may lead to cochlear activity.

The purpose of this study was to develop a 0.45 microm pore size dual membrane system, which can sequentially concentrate both viruses and bacteria. The top PVDF membrane was used to filter bacteria by physical straining while the bottom HA membrane retained viruses through adsorption. The recovery of this system was assessed using test organisms: enterococci and somatic coliphage. Volumes of 100 to 400 mL of unspiked and sewage-spiked beach water were filtered through both types of membranes. The PVDF membrane recovered statistically equivalent amounts of enterococci when compared to traditional membranes. All of the coliphage passed through the PVDF membrane, while 22% passed through the HA membrane. Increasing the volume from 100 to 400 mL did not significantly influence recoveries. Up to 35% of coliphage was eluted from the bottom membrane using beef extract solution. Rinsing bottom membranes with 0.5 mmol L(-1) H(2)S0(4) was found to deactivate somatic coliphage.

{"title": "Explanatory models for a tactile resonance sensor system-elastic and density-related variations of prostate tissue in vitro.", "abstract": "Tactile sensors based on piezoelectric resonance have been adopted for medical applications. The sensor consists of an oscillating piezoelectric sensor-circuit system, and a change in resonance frequency is observed when the sensor tip contacts a measured object such as tissue. The frequency change at a constant applied force or mass load is used as a stiffness-sensitive parameter in many applications. Differential relations between force and frequency have also been used for monitoring intraocular pressure and stiffness variations in prostate tissue in vitro. The aim of this study was to relate the frequency change (Deltaf), measured force (F) and the material properties, density and elasticity to an explanatory model for the resonance sensor measurement principle and thereby to give explanatory models for the stiffness parameters used previously. Simulations of theoretical equations were performed to investigate the relation between frequency change and contact impedance. Measurements with a resonance sensor system on prostate tissue in vitro were used for experimental validation of the theory. Tissue content was quantified with a microscopic-based morphometrical method. Simulation results showed that the frequency change was dependent upon density (rho) and contact area (S) according to Deltaf proportional, variant rhoS(3/2). The experiments followed the simulated theory at small impression depths. The measured contact force followed a theoretical model with the dependence of the elastic modulus (E) and contact area, F proportional, variant ES(3/2). Measured density variations related to histological variations were statistically weak or non-significant. Elastic variations were statistically significant with contributions from stroma and cancer relative to normal glandular tissue.

{"title": "A new MSPQC for rapid growth and detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "abstract": "Many of the deaths caused by tuberculosis (TB) in the world are due to wrong or late diagnosis. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls for better and cheaper TB tests method for this reason. In this paper, a new multi-channel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) sensor system was developed for rapid growth and detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is an automatic continuous monitoring system. The system was used to detect TB based on the volatile metabolic products NH(3) and CO(2) during the growth of M. tuberculosis. The metabolic products, diffusing from the medium into the KOH absorbing solution, resulted in the conductance change of the absorbing solution detected by the MSPQC sensitively. The frequency shift versus time response curves were recorded by self-developed software. Frequency detection time (FDT) corresponding to -100 Hz in frequency shift value was used as a parameter to quantitatively determine M. tuberculosis H37Ra (an avirulent strain). H37Ra and 40 strains clinic positive samples were detected by the proposed system successfully. As for H37Ra, the FDT had a linear relationship with the logarithm of its initial concentration in the range of 10(2)-10(7) colony forming units (cfu)ml(-1) (R=-0.998) and the detection limit was low to 10 cfu ml(-1). 4% NaOH solution that can kill contaminating microorganisms and make M. tuberculosis alive was used as pretreatment reagent to provide selectivity to this method. Comparative tests were also carried out by using BACTEC MGIT 960 and conventional Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) slants. The results showed that the proposed system was quicker than BACTEC MGIT 960 and it is also cheaper and will be widely used in TB tests in the world.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2008-06-10", "authors": ["JialiRen", "FengjiaoHe", "SonglinYi", "XiaoyingCui"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2008.04.018"}

The array consisted of 170 elements placed on the inner surface of a 15 cm radius spherical cap. Each element was independently driven by using individual pulsers each capable of generating 1.2 kV. Acoustic field customization was achieved by independently controlling the time when each element was excited. The set of time delays necessary to produce a particular acoustic field was determined by using an optimization scheme. The acoustic field at the focal plane was simulated by using the angular spectrum method, and the optimization searched for the time delays that minimized the least squared difference between the magnitudes of the simulated and desired pressure fields. The acoustic field was shaped in two different ways: the -6 dB focal width was increased to different desired widths and the ring-shaped pressure distributions of various prescribed diameters were produced. For both cases, the set of delays resulting from the respective optimization schemes were confirmed to yield the desired pressure distributions by using simulations and measurements. The simulations, however, predicted peak positive pressures roughly half those obtained from the measurements, which was attributed to the exclusion of nonlinearity in the simulations.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2008-06-10", "authors": ["Parag VChitnis", "Paul EBarbone", "Robin OCleveland"], "doi": "10.1121/1.2912448\n10.1016/S0140-6736(80)92335-1\n10.1016/S0301-5629(01)00345-3\n10.1121/1.406882\n10.1121/1.2032187\n10.1016/0301-5629(87)90157-8\n10.1121/1.396852\n10.1016/0301-5629(94)00091-Q\n10.1121/1.1349183\n10.1121/1.2177589\n10.1016/0301-5629(90)90170-H\n10.1121/1.423758\n10.1121/1.427123\n10.1121/1.1416906\n10.1016/S0301-5629(99)00124-6\n10.1121/1.1394221\n10.1016/0301-5629(94)00115-T\n10.1016/S0301-5629(96)00175-5\n10.1016/S0301-5629(02)00507-0\n10.1121/1.2404894\n10.1121/1.1377051\n10.1121/1.387606\n10.1121/1.397869\n10.1109/58.585184\n10.1121/1.401876\n10.1137/0111030\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1256313\n10.1121/1.415211\n10.1016/0041-624X(93)90020-Z\n10.1016/0301-5629(89)90066-5\n10.1103/PhysRevE.71.066616\n10.1006/uimg.1996.0006"}

The time-dependent equations of propagation are solved using the PS method while the electric field induced in the piezoelectric material is determined through a FD representation. The purpose of this combination is to keep the advantages of both methods in one model: the adaptability of FD representation to model piezoelectric elements with various geometries and materials, and the low number of nodes per wavelength required by the PS method. This approach is implemented to obtain an accurate algorithm to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves over large distances, directly coupled to the calculation of the electric field created inside the piezoelectric material, which is difficult with classical algorithms. These operations are computed using variables located on spatially and temporally staggered grids, which attenuate Gibbs phenomenon and increase the algorithm's accuracy. The two-dimensional modeling of a PZT plate excited by a 50 MHz sinusoidal electrical signal is performed. The results are successfully compared to those obtained using the finite-element (FE) algorithm of ATILA software with configurations spatially and temporally adapted to the FE requirements.

The transducer is composed of a fluid-filled rectangular duct with a tapered-width plate on one wall emulating the biological basilar membrane in the cochlea. A three-dimensional coupled fluid-structure model is developed to calculate the transducer sensitivity by using a boundary integral method. The model is used as the basis of an optimization methodology seeking to enhance the transducer performance. Simplified formulas are derived from the model to estimate the transducer sensitivity and the fundamental resonant frequency with good accuracy and much less computational cost. By using the simplified formulas, one can easily design the geometry of the transducer to achieve the optimal performance. As an example design, the transducer achieves a sensitivity of around -200 dB (1 VmuPa) at 10 kHz frequency range with piezoelectric sensing.

{"title": "New trends in bioanalytical tools for the detection of genetically modified organisms: an update.", "abstract": "Despite the controversies surrounding genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the production of GM crops is increasing, especially in developing countries. Thanks to new technologies involving genetic engineering and unprecedented access to genomic resources, the next decade will certainly see exponential growth in GMO production. Indeed, EU regulations based on the precautionary principle require any food containing more than 0.9% GM content to be labeled as such. The implementation of these regulations necessitates sampling protocols, the availability of certified reference materials and analytical methodologies that allow the accurate determination of the content of GMOs. In order to qualify for the validation process, a method should fulfil some criteria, defined as \"acceptance criteria\" by the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL). Several methods have recently been developed for GMO detection and quantitation, mostly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. PCR (including its different formats, e.g., double competitive PCR and real-time PCR) remains the technique of choice, thanks to its ability to detect even small amounts of transgenes in raw materials and processed foods. Other approaches relying on DNA detection are based on quartz crystal microbalance piezoelectric biosensors, dry reagent dipstick-type sensors and surface plasmon resonance sensors. The application of visible/near-infrared (vis/NIR) spectroscopy or mass spectrometry combined with chemometrics techniques has also been envisaged as a powerful GMO detection tool. Furthermore, in order to cope with the multiplicity of GMOs released onto the market, the new challenge is the development of routine detection systems for the simultaneous detection of numerous GMOs, including unknown GMOs.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "date": "2008-06-10", "authors": ["ElisaMichelini", "PatriziaSimoni", "LucaCevenini", "LauraMezzanotte", "AldoRoda"], "doi": "10.1007/s00216-008-2193-7"}

For symmetry species A1, six typical Raman-active optical modes have been recorded at 126, 245, 557, 604, 896 and 991 cm(-1), respectively. It is easy to assign the mode of 126 cm(-1) as the relative translation between SiO4, Sr and the TaO6. The mode 245 cm(-1) corresponds to the twisting vibration of SiO4 correlating with the Sr-TaO6-Sr stretching vibration. The mode 557 cm(-1) was assigned as the O-Ta-O stretching vibration, while the mode 604 cm(-1) as the O-Ga-O stretching vibration. The band at 896 cm(-1) in the Raman spectrum was assigned to be the O-Si-O stretching vibration of the two SiO4 tetrahedra in the primitive cell of STGS single crystal. Meanwhile, the band at 991 cm(-1) in the Raman spectrum was assigned to be the Si-O stretching vibration of the two SiO4 tetrahedra in the primitive cell of STGS single crystal. The layer structure of STGS crystal was identified by both theory study and Raman spectroscopy experiment results.

Lectins are immobilised onto a gold-plated quartz crystal for direct piezoelectric label-free transduction of the bacteria-lectin binding event using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). Concanavalin A (Con A) and Escherichia coli were used for the evaluation of the lectin immobilisation method and the biosensor performance. Adsorption on nonpolarised and polarised (-0.200 V) gold-coated quartz crystals and immobilisation through avidin-biotin binding were checked for Con A surface attachment. Lectin-bacteria binding was evaluated in all cases. With a crystal modified with Con A via avidin-biotin immobilisation we obtained a linear calibration plot between 5.0 x 10(6) and 2.0 x 10(7) cfu mL(-1) by measuring frequency changes with E. coli concentration 1 h after bacteria addition. A remarkable increase in sensitivity was achieved when the analytical solution contained free biotinylated Con A, as a consequence of multiple lectin adhesion to Escherichia coli cell wall, which produced an accumulation of Con A-E. coli conjugates in the form of multilayers at the electrode surface. A detection limit of approximately 1.0 x 10(4) cfu mL(-1) was achieved. Moreover nonspecific adsorptions were minimised. Using Con A and lectin from Arachis hypogaea, different response profiles were achieved for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium phlei, thus demonstrating the feasibility of bacteria discrimination. An approach involving filtering of free and lectin-bound bacteria and introduction of a filter in the measuring cell allowed a significant frequency change to be obtained for an E. coli concentration of 1.0 x 10(3) cfu mL(-1) in order to further increase the sensitivity and discriminate between viable and nonviable cells; an approach using electrochemical measurements of bacterial catalase activity was also checked.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "date": "2008-06-05", "authors": ["BSerra", "MGamella", "A JReviejo", "J MPingarr\u00f3n"], "doi": "10.1007/s00216-008-2141-6"}

{"title": "A new simple asymmetric hysteresis operator and its application to inverse control of piezoelectric actuators.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) are commonly used as micropositioning devices due to their high resolution, high stiffness, and fast frequency response. Because piezoceramic materials are ferroelectric, they fundamentally exhibit hysteresis behavior in their response to an applied electric field. The positioning precision can be significantly reduced due to nonlinear hysteresis effects when PEAs are used in relatively long range applications. This paper describes a new, precise, and simple asymmetric hysteresis operator dedicated to PEAs. The complex hysteretic transfer characteristic has been considered in a purely phenomenological way, without taking into account the underlying physics. This operator is based on two curves. The first curve corresponds to the main ascending branch and is modeled by the function f1. The second curve corresponds to the main reversal branch and is modeled by the function g2. The functions f(1) and g(2) are two very simple hyperbola functions with only three parameters. Particular ascending and reversal branches are deduced from appropriate translations of f(1) and g(2). The efficiency and precision of the proposed approach is demonstrated, in practice, by a real-time inverse feed-forward controller for piezoelectric actuators.

To optimize the equilibration time, the spermatozoa were equilibrated in the optimized medium for 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90 min at 40 degree C before plunging into liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the highest cleavage rate (87.4 percent) of IVF embryos was observed when equilibrated for 30 min. In experiment 2, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in Group 1 (81.2 percent, 65.4 percent) and Group 3 (72.5 percent, 45.0 percent) were higher (P less then 0.05) than those in Group 2 (22.2 percent and 13.9 percent), respectively. When 2-cell embryos obtained in Group 1 and 3 were transferred, 32.1 percent and 22.7 percent of embryos in the pregnant receipts developed to term, respectively.

The unbinding force corresponding to single UPy-UPy dimers was investigated at a fixed piezo retraction rate in the nonequilibrium loading rate regime. The rupture force of bridging supramolecular polymer chains formed between UPy-functionalized substrates and AFM tips in the presence of a bis-UPy derivative was found to decrease with increasing rupture length. The rupture length was identified as the chain length of single, associating polymers, which allowed us to determine the number of supramolecular bonds (N) at rupture. The rupture force observed as a function of N was in quantitative agreement with the theory on uncooperative bond rupture for supramolecular linkages switched in a series. Hence, the value of the dimer equilibrium constant Keq=(1.3+/-0.5) x 10(9) M(-1), which is in good agreement with previously estimated values, was obtained by SMFS of supramolecular polymers at a single loading rate.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

PAA functionalization was achieved by in situ free radical polymerization of acrylic acid in microfiltration membrane pores. Target ferrous ions were then introduced into the membranes by the ion exchange process. Subsequent reduction resulted in the in situ formation of 20-40 nm Fe nanoparticles. Bimetallic nanoparticles can be formed by post-deposition of Pd. The membranes and Fe/Pd nanoparticles were characterized by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), FTIR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2,2'-Dichlorobiphenyl (PCB4) and 3,3',4,4'-tertrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77) were chosen as the model compounds to investigate the catalytic properties of bimetallic nanoparticles, the reaction mechanism, and the intrinsic kinetics. A two-dimensional steady-state model was developed to correlate and simulate mass transfer and reaction in the membrane pores under pressure-driven convective flow conditions.

It is implemented in a device whose minimum working structure consists of a non-piezoelectric plane guide and two piezoelectric transducers operating as a generator and detector. The device is entirely in accordance with thick-film technology standard procedures. Both transducers are composed of a PZT ferroelectric layer deposited on a ceramic substrate and a suitable system of three coplanar metal electrodes placed inside the same layer. Beside setting the wavelength of propagation, the electrode system promotes piezoelectric deformations parallel to the substrate simultaneously contracting and extending contiguous active regions in the layer. Pure shear stresses are then induced on the involved guide surface, alternately distributed, with the spatial periodicity of the wave that will propagate in the guide. The propagation of several kinds of guided waves is possible so the selection of the one that meets a specific device design best is allowed. This work describes the design, realization and operation of a prototype structure consisting of an alumina plate guide and two pairs of piezoelectric thick-film transducers realized on it.

Measurements were made over a range of scan rates that span the range of Brownian velocities of such emulsion drops. The adsorbed anionic surfactants impart a stabilising electrical double layer repulsion between the drops so coalescence was not observed under present conditions. Force-displacement data follow reversible trajectories at low scan rates (<0.5 \u03bcm s-1) but exhibit increasingly large hysteric effects for scan rates up to 30 \u03bcm s-1. The coupling between deformations of the interacting drops and deflections of the AFM cantilever at high scan rates facilitates a self-consistent and independent estimate of the cantilever spring constant if one models variations of cantilever deflection with piezo displacement. In addition to giving excellent agreement between predicted and measured dynamic forces, our model also furnishes quantitative information about: variations of the force with interfacial separation, deformations and velocities of interfaces, pressure distributions in the aqueous film between the drops as well as the absolute separation between the interacting drops. A new dimpling phenomenon is inferred to occur when interacting drops are being separated after the formation of a flattened aqueous film.

These properties make them attractive for applications as sensors and actuators. Local clusters of randomly oriented polarization, known as polar nanoregions (PNRs), are specific to relaxor ferroelectrics and play a key role in governing their dielectric properties. Here, we show through neutron inelastic scattering experiments that the PNRs can also significantly affect the structural properties of the relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Zn(1/3)Nb(2/3))O(3)-4.5%PbTiO(3) (PZN-4.5%PT). A strong interaction is found between the PNRs and the propagation of acoustic phonons. A comparison between acoustic phonons propagating along different directions reveals a large asymmetry in the lattice dynamics that is induced by the PNRs.

This mass-sensitive sensor does not only allow the examination of the interaction between AChE and the modified surface but also the detection of in situ inhibition of the surface-bound AChE. Here we describe the application of the propidium-based sensor in combination with a modified AChE. For this reason the cocaine derivative benzoylecgonine (BZE) was coupled via a 10A long hydrophilic linker - 1,8-diamino-3,4-dioxaoctane - to carboxylic groups of the AChE after EDC/NHS activation. Thus the modified AChE (BZE-AChE) possesses an additional recognition element besides the inhibitor binding site. After the deposition of BZE-AChE on the sensor surface the binding of an anti-BZE-antibody to the BZE-AChE can be monitored. This makes it possible to determine two analytes - cocaine and organophosphate - in one experiment by measuring antibody binding and decrease in enzymatic activity, respectively. Furthermore it was also shown that other cocaine-binding enzymes, e.g., butyrylcholinesterase, can bind to the modified BZE-AChE. The competitive immunoassay allowed the detection of cocaine with a dynamic range from 10(-9) to 10(-7)M.

Based on the experimental results, the dual-resonance frequencies showed a nonlinear decreasing trend with a linear increase of the mass loading. Therefore, a modified formula was carried out. Furthermore, the ratio of the longitudinal-resonant frequency to the shear-resonant frequency remained at a range around 1.76 despite the various c-axis tilted angles of AlN and gradual mass loading on the SMR.

Here we report a whole-cell injection technique without Piezo assistance for nuclear transfer in pigs. The fibroblast cell of pig as the nucleus donor cell, effects of the new method on the efficiency of somatic nuclear transfer in pig were investigated, compared with that of electric fusion method. Results showed that the new method was a little less efficient in producing reconstructed embryos but without significant difference (88.4% vs 78%, P > 0.05). After the embryos were cultured 48h and 7d, the fusion method is more efficient than the new method in the oocyte cleavage rate and the blastocyst development (78% vs 53.2%, P < 0.05; 27.2% vs 13.8%, P < 0.01). The results indicate that both methods make no difference in the quality of the blastula, but the electric fusion method is more efficient.

The conduction behavior of these electrolytes was investigated with varying LiI concentration (10-60 wt % in polymer blend) by impedance spectroscopy. A \"polymer-in-salt\" like conduction behavior has been observed in the high salt concentration region. The transition from \"salt-in-polymer\" to \"polymer-in-salt\" conduction behavior happened at the salt content of 23.4 wt %, which is much lower than 50 wt % as generally reported. The electrolyte shows the highest ionic conductivity (approximately 10(-3) S cm(-1)) at the salt concentration above 23.4 wt %. From the evaluation of salt effect on the performances of corresponding DSSC, we find that increasing LiI concentration leads to increased short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) caused by enhanced I3(-) diffusion up to an LiI content of 28.9 wt %. Above this limitation, the Jsc decreases as a result of increased charge recombination caused by the further increased I3(-) concentration. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) increases gradually with LiI concentration owing to the enhanced I(-) content in DSSC. The optimized conversion efficiency is obtained at a salt content of 28.9 wt % in the \"polymer-in-salt\" region, with high ionic conductivity (1.06 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)). Based on these facts, we suggest that the changes of conduction behavior and the changes of I3(-) and I(-) concentrations in the electrolytes contribute to the final performance variation of the corresponding DSSC with varying LiI concentration.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

One approach towards this goal is the use of composites that couple ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers through magnetostrictive and piezoelectric strain transmitted across the interfaces. However, mechanical clamping of the films to the substrate limits their response. Structures where the magnetic response is modulated directly by the electric field of the poled ferroelectric would eliminate this constraint and provide a qualitatively higher level of integration, combining the emerging field of multiferroics with conventional semiconductor microelectronics. Here, we report the realization of such a device using (Ga,Mn)As, which is an archetypical diluted magnetic semiconductor with well-understood carrier-mediated ferromagnetism, and a polymer ferroelectric gate. Polarization reversal of the gate by a single voltage pulse results in a persistent modulation of the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic semiconductor. The non-volatile gating of (Ga,Mn)As has been made possible by applying a low-temperature copolymer deposition technique that is distinct from pre-existing technologies for ferroelectric gates on magnetic oxides.

In this type of actuator, friction plays an active role in producing a meaningful stick-slip motion. However, friction is a source of heat which may cause significant temperature rise, affecting the dynamic performance of the actuator. Our study aimed to measure temperature rise in the stick-slip motion and to understand whether such a rise could significantly affect the displacement of the stick-slip motion. In this study, a temperature measurement system was developed using the off-the-shelf components, with which the temperature rise up to 0.436 degrees C was successfully measured on a proprietary PZT-SS actuator. The experiment further shows that the temperature rise affects the displacement of the actuator when operating voltage is at the low end (approximately 6 V). Therefore, one of the design recommendations for such an actuator system is that the operating voltage should be at the high end (approximately 30 V). The study also measured the temperature rise (approximately 0.263 degrees C after the system worked for 6300 s) at the friction interface due to the piezoelectric element which is a part of the whole PZT-SS actuator. This means that temperature rise is due to both the friction at two interacting surface and the operation of the piezoelectric element.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2008-05-02", "authors": ["J WLi", "G SYang", "W JZhang", "S DTu", "X BChen"], "doi": "10.1063/1.2908162"}

Experimentally, by using both an ultrasonic probe for the emission (piezoelectric transducer) and a heterodyne optic probe for the reception (interferometer), it was possible to take spectroscopic measurements of spheroidal vibrations over a large frequency range (100 kHz-45 MHz) in a continuous regime. This method, which uses ratios between wave resonance frequencies, allows the Poisson coefficient to be determined independently of Young's modulus and the ball's radius and density.

{"title": "Evaluation of a novel solid-state method for determining the acoustic power generated by physiotherapy ultrasound transducers.", "abstract": "A new secondary method of determining ultrasound power is presented based on the pyroelectricity of a thin membrane of the piezoelectric polymer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). In operation, the membrane is backed by a polyurethane-based rubber material that is extremely attenuating to ultrasound, resulting in the majority of the acoustic power applied to the PVDF being absorbed within a short distance of the membrane-backing interface. The resulting rapid heating leads to a pyroelectric voltage being generated across the electrodes of the sensor that, under appropriate conditions, is related to the rate of change of temperature with respect to time. For times immediately after changes in transducer excitation (switching either ON or OFF), the change in the pyroelectric voltage is proportional to the delivered ultrasound power level. This paper describes a systematic evaluation of the measurement concept applied at physiotherapy frequencies and power levels, investigating key aspects such as repeatability, linearity and sensitivity. The research demonstrates the way that heating of the backing material affects the sensor performance, but outlines the potential of the method as a reproducible, rapid, solid-state method of determining power, requiring calibration using a known ultrasound power source.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2008-04-29", "authors": ["BajramZeqiri", "JillBarrie"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.02.003"}

Due to deployment difficulties and low efficiency of the earlier (conventional) version of ICSI, especially in the mouse, a piezo-assisted ICSI technique had evolved as a popular ART methodology in recent years. An important and remaining problem with this technique, however, is that it requires small amounts of mercury to stabilize the pipette tip when piezoelectric force pulses are applied. To eliminate this problem we developed and tested a completely different and mercury-free technology, called the \"Ros-Drill\" (rotationally oscillating drill). The technique uses microprocessor-controlled rotational oscillations on a spiked micropipette without mercury or piezo. Preliminary experimental results show that this new microinjection technology gives high survival rate (>70% of the injected oocytes) and fertilization rate (>80% of the survived oocytes), and blastocyst formation rates in early trials (approximately 50% of the survived oocytes). Blastocysts created by Ros-Drill ICSI were transferred into the uteruses of pseudopregnant surrogate mothers and healthy pups were born and weaned. The Ros-Drill ICSI technique is automated and therefore; it requires a very short preliminary training for the specialists, as evidenced in many successful biological trials. These advantages of Ros-Drill ICSI over conventional and piezo-assisted ICSI are clearly demonstrated and it appears to have resolved an important problem in reproductive biology.", "journal": "Molecular reproduction and development", "date": "2008-04-26", "authors": ["Ali FuatErgenc", "Ming-WenLi", "MehmetToner", "John DBiggers", "K C KentLloyd", "NejatOlgac"], "doi": "10.1002/mrd.20919"}

The X-ray and neutron diffraction studies used for the average symmetry determination of lead zirconate titanate [Pb(ZrxTi(1- x))O3, PZT] ceramics and powders are reviewed. The results obtained through two frequently used local probes, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with electron diffraction (ED) and Raman scattering measurements, are summarized. On the basis of these studies, structural trends as a function of composition x and temperature are outlined. There are two distinguished intrinsic structural features, (i) lead-ion shifts and (ii) local structural distortions related to different B cations and the spatial composition variation of x, which have a pronounced effect on the functional properties of PZT. Particular attention is paid to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions for which a large number of different structural models have been proposed. Earlier symmetry considerations show that the monoclinic phase cannot serve as a continuous bridge between tetragonal and rhombohedral phases. This suggests that the two-phase coexistence has an important role for the piezoelectric properties. Near the MPB, the extrinsic contribution to piezoelectricity includes pressure (or electric-field)-induced changes in phase fractions and domain wall motion. It was recently shown that the domain contribution is crucial for the electromechanical properties of PZT in the vicinity of the MPB.

Spore binding to the anti-BA spore IgG coated PEMS surface is determined by monitoring the resonance frequency change in the sensor's impedance vs. frequency spectrum. Flow increases the resonance frequency shift at lower flow rates until the impingement force from the flow overcomes the binding strength of the antigen and decreases the resonance frequency shift at higher flow rates. We showed that the change from increasing to decreasing resonance frequency shift occurred at a lower fluid flow speed for BT, BC, and BS spores than for BA spores. This trend reduces the cross reactivity ratio of BC, BS, and BT to the anti-BA spore IgG immobilized PEMS from around 0.4 at low flow velocities to less than 0.05 at 3.8 mm s(-1).

During this exchange, reduction of tetrachloropalladate by polypyrrole occurred, which led to the formation of palladium nanoparticles within the film. For the second approach, the membrane-supported Fe/Pd nanoparticles were prepared in three steps: polymerization of acrylic acid in polyvinylidene fluoride microfiltration membrane pores was followed by ion exchange of Fe(2+), and then chemical reduction of the ferrous ions bound to the carboxylate groups. The membrane-supported iron nanoparticles were then soaked in a solution of tetrachloropalladate resulting in the deposition of Pd on the Fe surface. The nanoparticles prepared by both approaches were employed in the dechlorination of PCB77. The presence of hydrogen was required when the monometallic Pd nanoparticles were employed. The results indicate the removal of chlorine atoms from PCB77, which led to the formation of lower chlorinated intermediates and ultimately biphenyl. Toxicity associated with vascular dysfunction by PCB77 and biphenyl was compared using cultured endothelial cells. The data strongly suggest that the dechlorination system used in this study markedly reduced the proinflammatory activity of PCB77, a persistent organic pollutant.", "journal": "Journal of hazardous materials", "date": "2008-04-22", "authors": ["KarthikVenkatachalam", "XabierArzuaga", "NitinChopra", "Vasilis GGavalas", "JianXu", "DibakarBhattacharyya", "BernhardHennig", "Leonidas GBachas"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.02.109"}

No side effects were detected during unintentional contact with the nerve.\nThe aim of this work was to test Piezosurgery as a new and alternative method to conventional bone tissue management in facial nerve decompression by posterior tympanotomy.\nWe used Piezosurgery under general anaesthesia on 10 patients affected by facial paralysis following temporal bone fractures. The equipment consists of two hand-pieces, two inserts and two peristaltic pumps connected to the control unit. The device uses low frequency ultrasonic waves (24.7-29.5 kHz), the applied power can be modulated between 2.8 and 16 W, and the machine is programmed in accordance with the density of the bone. The micro-vibrations that are created in the piezoelectric hand-piece cause the inserts to vibrate linearly between 60 and 210 microm.\nPiezosurgery proved effective in sclerotic and pneumatic mastoid. This approach results in significantly less operative blood loss and better visibility in the surgical field compared with conventional methods.

{"title": "Acoustic emissions during 3.1 MHz ultrasound bulk ablation in vitro.", "abstract": "Acoustic emissions associated with cavitation and other bubble activity have previously been observed during ultrasound (US) ablation experiments. Because detectable bubble activity may be related to temperature, tissue state and sonication characteristics, these acoustic emissions are potentially useful for monitoring and control of US ablation. To investigate these relationships, US ablation experiments were performed with simultaneous measurements of acoustic emissions, tissue echogenicity and tissue temperature on fresh bovine liver. Ex vivo tissue was exposed to 0.9-3.3-s bursts of unfocused, continuous-wave, 3.10-MHz US from a miniaturized 32-element array, which performed B-scan imaging with the same piezoelectric elements during brief quiescent periods. Exposures used pressure amplitudes of 0.8-1.4 MPa for exposure times of 6-20 min, sufficient to achieve significant thermal coagulation in all cases. Acoustic emissions received by a 1-MHz, unfocused passive cavitation detector, beamformed A-line signals acquired by the array, and tissue temperature detected by a needle thermocouple were sampled 0.3-1.1 times per second. Tissue echogenicity was quantified by the backscattered echo energy from a fixed region-of-interest within the treated zone. Acoustic emission levels were quantified from the spectra of signals measured by the passive cavitation detector, including subharmonic signal components at 1.55 MHz, broadband signal components within the band 0.3-1.1 MHz and low-frequency components within the band 10-30 kHz. Tissue ablation rates, defined as the thermally ablated volumes per unit time, were assessed by quantitative analysis of digitally imaged, macroscopic tissue sections. Correlation analysis was performed among the averaged and time-dependent acoustic emissions in each band considered, B-mode tissue echogenicity, tissue temperature and ablation rate. Ablation rate correlated significantly with broadband and low-frequency emissions, but was uncorrelated with subharmonic emissions. Subharmonic emissions were found to depend strongly on temperature in a nonlinear manner, with significant emissions occurring within different temperature ranges for each sonication amplitude. These results suggest potential roles for passive detection of acoustic emissions in guidance and control of bulk US ablation treatments.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2008-04-19", "authors": ["T DouglasMast", "Vasant ASalgaonkar", "ChandrapriyaKarunakaran", "John ABesse", "SaurabhDatta", "Christy KHolland"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.02.007"}

In particular, understanding the transient dynamics of a bar-type ultrasonic motor, such as starting up and stopping, is of primary interest. First, the transient response of the bar-type ultrasonic motor at starting up and stopping was measured using a laser Doppler velocimeter, and its driving characteristics are discussed in detail. The motor is shown to possess amplitude-dependent nonlinearity that greatly influences the transient dynamics of the motor. Second, a dynamical model of the motor was constructed as a second-order nonlinear oscillator, which represents the dynamics of the piezoelectric ceramic, stator, and rotor. The model features nonlinearities caused by the frictional interface between the stator and the rotor, and cubic nonlinearity in the dynamics of the stator. Coulomb's friction model was employed for the interface model, and a stick-slip phenomenon is considered. Lastly, it was shown that the model is capable of representing the transient dynamics of the motor accurately. The critical parameters in the model were identified from measured results, and numerical simulations were conducted using the model with the identified parameters.

A piezoelectric layer is described by a three-port equivalent network, a nonpiezoelectric layer, and a short- or open-circuit piezoelectric layer by a two-port one. Electrical input impedance of the resonator is derived in terms of the Z-matrix of both the piezoelectric layer and an external load, the unique expression applies whether the resonator is a mono- or electroded-layer or a solidly mounted resonator (SMR). The loading effects of Al-electrodes on the resonating frequencies of the piezoelectric ZnO-layer are analyzed.

The phantom consisted of a flat and parallel Plexiglas plate into which a step discontinuity was milled. The phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of the plate were measured using both broadband and narrowband data and were calculated using standard magnitude and phase spectroscopy techniques. The observed frequency dependence of the phase velocity and attenuation coefficient exhibit significant changes in their frequency dependences as the interrogating ultrasonic field is translated across the step discontinuity of the plate. Negative dispersion is observed at specific spatial locations of the plate at which the attenuation coefficient rises linearly with frequency, a behavior analogous to that of bone measurements reported in the literature. For all sites investigated, broadband and narrowband data (3-7 MHz) demonstrate excellent consistency. Evidence suggests that the interference between the two signals simultaneously reaching the phase sensitive piezoelectric receiver is responsible for this negative dispersion.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2008-04-10", "authors": ["Adam QBauer", "Karen RMarutyan", "Mark RHolland", "James GMiller"], "doi": "10.1121/1.2839893\n10.1109/58.677603\n10.1088/0031-9155/41/11/013\n10.1121/1.2126934\n10.1016/S0301-5629(99)00172-6\n10.1121/1.2697436\n10.1121/1.385566\n10.1121/1.429586\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1503968\n10.1121/1.2401198\n10.1121/1.2357187\n10.1121/1.387128\n10.1121/1.1908249\n10.1121/1.1918701\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.395\n10.1121/1.2735803\n10.1121/1.387127\n10.1016/S0301-5629(98)00154-9\n10.1121/1.427139\n10.1121/1.2188333\n10.1121/1.1365114\n10.1016/S0301-5629(99)00034-4\n10.1016/0165-2125(84)90033-7\n10.1109/58.935726\n10.1121/1.1908239\n10.1121/1.1908241"}

Conventional microphone arrays have been widely utilized to realize noise reduction, sound separation and direction of arrival estimation system. However, when a conventional microphone array is mounted on a real system, such as a machine, vehicle or robot, the microphones are set extremely close to the system's actual body. In such cases, the noise from the system itself, such as motors, gears, and engines, namely internal noise, often becomes a troublesome problem. It is difficult to reduce internal noise utilizing a conventional microphone array because internal noise sources are extremely close to the microphones. As internal noise is not always stationary, statistically independent or sparse, most useful blind source separation approaches, such as independent component analysis and the sparseness approach, cannot be employed. Our aim is to reduce internal noise utilizing microphones and piezoelectric devices attached to the internal noise source. In this paper, a general description of the acoustical array is formulated and the characteristic features of microphones and piezoelectric devices in an acoustical array are given.

{"title": "Acoustic energy harvesting using an electromechanical Helmholtz resonator.", "abstract": "This paper presents the development of an acoustic energy harvester using an electromechanical Helmholtz resonator (EMHR). The EMHR consists of an orifice, cavity, and a piezoelectric diaphragm. Acoustic energy is converted to mechanical energy when sound incident on the orifice generates an oscillatory pressure in the cavity, which in turns causes the vibration of the diaphragm. The conversion of acoustic energy to electrical energy is achieved via piezoelectric transduction in the diaphragm of the EMHR. Moreover, the diaphragm is coupled with energy reclamation circuitry to increase the efficiency of the energy conversion. Lumped element modeling of the EMHR is used to provide physical insight into the coupled energy domain dynamics governing the energy reclamation process. The feasibility of acoustic energy reclamation using an EMHR is demonstrated in a plane wave tube for two power converter topologies. The first is comprised of only a rectifier, and the second uses a rectifier connected to a flyback converter to improve load matching. Experimental results indicate that approximately 30 mW of output power is harvested for an incident sound pressure level of 160 dB with a flyback converter.

By applying the electrical boundary conditions, the layer impedance matrix is reduced to a unified elastic form whether the material is piezoelectric or not. The characteristic equation for the dispersion curves is derived in both forms of a three-dimensional acoustic SIM and of an electrical scalar function. The same approach is extended to multilayered structures such as a piezoelectric layer sandwiched in between two metallic electrodes, a Bragg coupler, and a semi-infinite substrate as well. The effectiveness of the approach is numerically demonstrated by its ability to determine the full spectra of guided modes, even at extremely high frequencies, in layered plates comprising up to four layers and three materials.

{"title": "Noninvasive respiratory monitoring system based on the piezoceramic transducer's pyroelectric effect.", "abstract": "This paper presents a simple alternative method and system for noninvasive respiratory airflow monitoring. The proposed system uses a piezoceramic transducer to measure respiratory airflow. When a piezoceramic transducer is impacted by respiratory airflow, there is a piezoelectric and a pyroelectric response to pressure and thermal airflow fluctuations. In this study, the selected transducer's response output is dominated by the pyroelectricity factor. Therefore, the piezoelectric effect is not significant and can be ignored in this study. Using the transducer's pyroelectricity to measure thermal flow variations, a subject's respiratory rate and respiratory air volumetric flow rate can be monitored. The proposed system was evaluated for accuracy and response time using quiet and postphysical exertion breathing modes. Using the pneumotach system as a benchmark, the proposed system's respiratory rate measurement accuracy for the two breathing modes is approximately 98.78%. In addition, the proposed system's output voltage is highly correlated with the respiratory volumetric flow rate measured by the selected pneumotach (r2=0.9783). The average correlation coefficient between the pneumotach system's output waveform and the proposed system is approximately 0.9389. Moreover, the proposed system and the selected pneumotach have almost the same rapid response time to respiratory airflow. When compared to a temperature measurement thermistor system, the thermistor on average is approximately 25.3 ms slower than the proposed system. Furthermore, compared to the selected screen-type pneumotach system, the proposed system simplifies the respiration monitoring requirements. Instead of sensing the pressure drop across a mesh screen, like the screen-type pneumotach, it measures respiration at one point within the respiratory airflow. The proposed system benefits from simplified processing circuits and a mesh-free design. The advantages of this new respiratory airflow measurement method are fast response time, high accuracy, low cost, and ease of implementation.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2008-04-02", "authors": ["Y PHuang", "M SYoung", "C CTai"], "doi": "10.1063/1.2889398"}

{"title": "Rapid leaching of Cr(VI) in soil with Na3PO4 in the determination of hexavalent chromium by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry.", "abstract": "A method has been developed that leaches Cr(VI) selectively from soil samples. Hexavalent chromium was leached completely from soil with 0.01molL(-1) Na(3)PO(4). This was achieved by boiling the soil-reagent solution mixture for a period of 5min. The leached Cr(VI) was then quantified by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ET-AAS) after filtration of the sample solutions through Hydrophilic Millipore PVDF 0.45microm filter. Statistical evaluations indicated that the new developed method is reliable since neither its comparison with the established method nor the comparison of the sum of the concentrations of chromium species to that of the total concentration of chromium show any difference at 95% level of confidence. The spiking of soil samples with Cr(III) standards before pretreatment show that Cr(III) was not oxidized to Cr(VI) during leaching as the Cr(VI) content never increased. The detection limit established was 0.07microg g(-1), which is an improvement to that of the US EPA method 3060A by a factor of more than 500.

A within-patient control study was carried out. The osteotomy for sinus access was performed on one side of the maxilla using the piezosurgery (test sites) and on the other side using conventional rotary diamond burs (control sites). The parameters recorded were as follows: bony window length (L), bony window height (H), bone thickness (T) and osteotomy area (A)--calculated by multiplying L and H. In addition, the time necessary for the osteotomy and sinus membrane elevation as well as the number of surgical complications were calculated.\nThe mean length and height of the bone window were similar in both groups. The osteotomy area (A) obtained by multiplying L and H was wider in the control group (151.2 +/- 20.4 mm(2)) compared with the test group (137 +/- 24.2 mm(2)). The time necessary for the osteotomy and the sinus membrane elevation with conventional instruments was 10.2 +/- 2.4 min, while with the piezoelectric device it was 11.5 +/- 3.8 min. Moreover, membrane perforation occurred in 30% of the maxillary sinuses in the test group and in 23% of the control group. None of the differences observed between the two groups reached a level of significance.\nWithin the limits of the present study, it may be concluded that piezosurgery and conventional instruments did not show any differences in the clinical parameters investigated for the maxillary sinus floor elevation.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2008-03-29", "authors": ["AntonioBarone", "StefanoSantini", "SimoneMarconcini", "LucaGiacomelli", "EnricoGherlone", "UgoCovani"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0501.2007.01498.x"}

A new piezoelectric actuated device for production of single hydrosomes on demand is introduced. Hydrosomes containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were injected, optically trapped, and held at the focus of an excitation laser in a confocal microscope, and single-molecule photobleaching events were observed. The rotational diffusion time of EGFP in trapped hydrosomes was measured using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy. In free solution, the mean rotational diffusion time was determined to be 13.8 +/- 0.1 ns at 3 microM and 14.0 +/- 0.2 ns at 10 microM. In hydrosomes, the mean rotational diffusion time was similar and determined to be 12.6 +/- 1.0 ns at 3 microM and 15.5 +/- 1.6 ns at 10 microM. We conclude that the rotational motion inside the nanodroplets is consistent with rotation in free solution and that the protein therefore does not aggregate at the water-oil interface.

{"title": "Thermoreversible gelation of poly(vinylidene fluoride) in phthalates: the influence of aliphatic chain length of solvents.", "abstract": "Thermoreversible gelation of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) has been studied in a new series of solvents (phthalates), for example, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and dihexyl phthalate (DHP) as a function of temperature and polymer concentration, both by test tube tilting and dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. The effect of aliphatic chain length (n) of diesters on the gelation kinetics, structure/microstructure and morphology of PVDF gels has been examined. Gelation rate was found to increase with increasing aliphatic chain length of diester. DLS results indicate that the sol-gel transformation proceeds via two-steps: first, microgel domains were formed, and then the infinite three-dimensional (3D) network is established by connecting microgels through polymer chains. The crystallites are responsible for 3D network for gelation in phthalates, and alpha-polymorph is formed during gelation producing higher amount of crystallinity with increasing aliphatic chain length of diester. Morphology of the networks of dried gels in different phthalates showed that fibril thickness and lateral dimensions decrease with higher homologues of phthalates. The scattering intensity is fitted with Debye-Bueche model in small-angle neutron scattering and suggested that both the correlation length and interlamellar spacing increases with n. A model has been proposed, based on electronic structure calculations, to explain the conformation of PVDF chain in presence of various phthalates and their complexes, which offer the cause of higher gelation rate for longer aliphatic chain length.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

In this study, comparative measurements of gold nanoparticle adsorption kinetics using high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy and SAW sensors allow the frequency responses of SAW sensors to be quantitatively correlated with surface densities of adsorbed nanoparticles. Using this approach, gold nanoparticles are used as the \"nanosized mass standards\" to scale the mass loading in a wide dynamical range. Rayleigh-SAW and guided SH-SAW sensors are employed here to monitor the surface mass changes on the device surfaces in gas and liquid phases, respectively. The mass sensitivity ( approximately 20 Hz.cm2/ng) of Rayleigh-SAW device (fundamental oscillation frequency of 113.3 MHz in air) is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional 9-MHz quartz crystal microbalance sensors. Furthermore, in situ (aqueous solutions), real-time measurements of adsorption kinetics for both citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles and DNA-gold nanoparticle conjugates are also demonstrated by guided SH-SAW (fundamental oscillation frequency of 121.3 MHz). By comparing frequency shifts between the adsorption cases of gold nanoparticles and DNA-gold nanoparticle conjugates, the average number of bound oligonucleotides per gold nanoparticle can also be determined.

A viable point-of-care biosensor is fast, reliable, simple, cost-effective, and detects low concentrations of the target analyte. The target of biosensors is biological such as bacteria or virus and as such, the antibody-antigen bond derived from the real immune response is used. Biosensor applications include lab-based tests for the purposes of diagnostics, drug discovery, and research. Additional applications include environmental, food, and agricultural monitoring. The main merits of the bond-rupture method are quick, simple, and capable of discriminating between specific and non-specific interactions. The separation of specific and non-specific bonds is important for working in real-life complex serums such as blood. The bond-rupture technique can provide both qualitative results, the detection of a target, and quantitative results, the concentration of target. Bond-rupture achieves this by a label-free method requiring no pre-processing of the analyte.

{"title": "Two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopic study on the crystallization and gelation of poly(vinylidene fluoride) in cyclohexanone.", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) converts easily into a thermo-reversible gel through crystallization by standing at room temperature in cyclohexanone. In this study, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured continuously at room temperature during the conversion of the solution into a gel. The IR difference spectra derived from these spectra by absorbance subtraction clearly indicate the presence of PVDF alpha-crystallites in the gel due to the presence of absorption bands corresponding to the TG+TG- conformation of the alpha-phase. In the time interval from 25 to 45 min after the beginning of the experiment, the IR bands of PVDF increased dramatically, indicating the conversion of polymer chains from random statistical coils to the ordered TG+TG- conformation (alpha-form). In the time interval from 45 to 90 min, the IR bands of PVDF increased slowly, reflecting no further crystallization. Using two-dimensional (2D) IR analysis, it could be shown that the nu(C=O) absorption band of cyclohexanone changed during the gelation process. During the conformational ordering process (25-45 min), the nu(C=O) absorption band of the cyclohexanone dimer (1707 cm(-1)) decreased while the corresponding band of the monomer at 1718 cm(-1) increased. Furthermore, a new band at 1695 cm(-1) increased, which could be assigned to C=O groups of the solvent interacting with the CF2 groups in the polymer chain. The bands of the crystalline PVDF share positive cross-peaks with the bands of cyclohexanone, which indicates that the chain of PVDF changed prior to the cyclohexanone molecules during the conformational ordering process. However, these positive cross-peaks disappeared during the crystallization process, which means that the chain of PVDF changed synchronously with the solvent molecules. As for the bands of PVDF chains, the band at 762 cm(-1) varied prior to the bands at 873 cm(-1) and 796 cm(-1) during the conformational ordering process. The 762 cm(-1) absorption is assigned to the CF2 group of PVDF, the 873 cm(-1) absorption involves the C-C group of PVDF, and the 796 cm(-1) band is attributed to the CH2 groups of PVDF. Thus, the CF2 functionalities change faster than the C-C and CH2 groups. However, the correlation cross-peaks between 762 cm(-1) and 873 cm(-1) and at 796 cm(-1) disappeared during the later state of the gelation process.

The method is applied to analyze the phononic plates composed of solid-solid and airsolid constituents with square and triangular lattices, respectively. Factors that influence the opening and width of the complete Lamb wave gaps are identified and discussed. For solid/solid phononic plates, it is suggested that the filling material be chosen with larger mass density, proper stiffness, and weak anisotropic factor embedded in a soft matrix in order to obtain wider complete band gaps of the lower-order Lamb waves. By comparing to the calculated results without considering the piezoelectricity, the influences of piezoelectric effect on Lamb waves are analyzed as well.

{"title": "Modeling for temperature compensation and temperature characterizations of BAW resonators at GHz frequencies.", "abstract": "This paper deals with the temperature dependence of electrical and physical features of various kinds of solidly mounted resonators (SMR). The presented bulk acoustic wave (BAW) devices are designed for the 2 GHz application. The temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) is determined from measurements well above the temperature range defined for wireless telecommunication system specifications. Therefore, evolution of electromechanical coupling factors and quality factors at resonance and antiresonance are also monitored. Results of characterizations show the trend for a subsequent theoretical temperature compensation study by using analytical modeling. To improve accuracy of modeling, an attempt to extract temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity epsilon(33) and piezoelectric coefficient e(33) is made. Finally, a well-known analytical model is modified to take into account the temperature dependence of length, density, stiffness coefficient, dielectric permittivity, and piezoelectric coefficient. Modeling highlights the need to deposit a material with positive temperature coefficient of stiffness on the top electrode. Realistic thickness of such a layer is determined. At the same time, it is necessary to adjust piezoelectric and electrode thin film thicknesses for simultaneously keeping a constant antiresonance frequency, reaching a zero temperature coefficient of frequency for antiresonance, and minimizing the decrease in the coupling factor because of the mass-loading deposition.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2008-03-13", "authors": ["BriceIvira", "PhippippeBenech", "Ren\u00e9Fillit", "FabienNdagijimana", "PascalAncey", "GuyParat"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2008.660"}
{"title": "Viscoelastic property measurement in thin tissue constructs using ultrasound.", "abstract": "We present a dual-element concave ultrasound transducer system for generating and tracking of localized tissue displacements in thin tissue constructs on rigid substrates. The system is comprised of a highly focused PZT-4 5-MHz acoustic radiation force (ARF) transducer and a confocal 25-MHz polyvinylidene fluoride imaging transducer. This allows for the generation of measurable displacements in tissue samples on rigid substrates with thickness values down to 500 microm. Impulse-like and longer duration sine-modulated ARF pulses are possible with intermittent M-mode data acquisition for displacement tracking. The operations of the ARF and imaging transducers are strictly synchronized using an integrated system for arbitrary waveform generation and data capture with a shared timebase. This allows for virtually jitter-free pulse-echo data well suited for correlation-based speckle tracking. With this technique we could faithfully capture the entire dynamics of the tissue axial deformation at pulse-repetition frequency values up to 10 kHz. Spatio-temporal maps of tissue displacements in response to a variety of modulated ARF beams were produced in tissue-mimicking elastography phantoms on rigid substrates. The frequency response was measured for phantoms with different modulus and thickness values. The frequency response exhibited resonant behavior with the resonance frequency being inversely proportional to the sample thickness. This resonant behavior can be used in obtaining high-contrast imaging using magnitude and phase response to sinusoidally modulated ARF beams. Furthermore, a second order forced harmonic oscillator (FHO) model was shown to capture this resonant behavior. Based on the FHO model, we used the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for tracking the apparent modulus and viscosity of samples subjected to dc and sinusoidally modulated ARF. The results show that the stiffness (apparent modulus) term in the FHO is largely time-invariant and can be estimated robustly using the EKF. On the other hand, the damping (apparent viscosity) is time varying. These findings were confirmed by comparing the magnitude response of the FHO (with parameters obtained using the EKF) with the measured ones for different thin tissue constructs.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2008-03-13", "authors": ["DalongLiu", "Emad SEbbini"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2008.655"}

A PSPICE simulation model for the power converter output stage was developed. The simulated results were in good agreement with the measurement. The waveform and harmonic contents of the acoustic pressure generated by a 1-MHz, self-focused piezoelectric transducer with and without harmonic cancellation have been evaluated. Measured results indicated that the acoustic third harmonicto- fundamental ratio at the focus was small (-48 dB) with harmonic cancellation, compared to that without harmonic cancellation (-20 dB). The measured acoustic levels of the fifth harmonic for both cases with and without harmonic cancellation also were small (-46 dB) compared to the fundamental.

However, the embedded therapeutic and diagnostic procedures require the use of lead-free piezoelectric materials as active elements in transducers. With this goal in mind, we investigated the substitution of Ba(2+) cations in a lead-free piezoelectric system of K(1/2)Na(1/2)NbO(3)-LiTaO(3)-LiSbO(3) (KNN-LT-LS) with perovskite structure. The Ba(2+) was added to the system as an A-site dopant in the range of 0-2 mol% in increments of 0.5 mol%. The addition of Ba(2+) improved the piezoelectric charge coefficient, d(33), and longitudinal coupling coefficient, k(33). The composition with 1 mol% Ba2+ had 36% and 58% higher d(33) and k(33), respectively, than the undoped composition. It appeared that the addition of Ba(2+) induced \"soft\" characteristics in this lead-free piezoelectric system. This was verified by the increase of remnant polarization along with the decline of coercive field. The Ba(2+) behaved as a grain growth inhibitor and caused a drastic reduction in polarization level (approximately 60%) when the grain size became smaller than approximately 1.5 microm. Incorporation of Ba(2+) up to 1.5 mol% increased the bulk resistivity of the KNN-LT-LS system and then reduced it drastically at higher dopant concentrations. The electron-hole compensation model fit well with the results obtained in this study and verified the A-site substitution of donor-doped barium. KNN-LT-LS ceramics with 0 mol% and 1 mol% Ba(2+) were used to fabricate single-element ultrasonic transducers resonating at 5.5 MHz.

First, a mathematical model that represents the dynamics of the two-dimensional piezo-positioning stage is proposed. In this model, a hysteresis friction force that describes the hysteresis behavior of one-dimensional motion is used; and a nonconstant stiffness with the cross-coupling dynamic due to the effect of bending of a lever mechanism in x and y axes also is included. Then, according to the proposed mathematical model, an ARRBFN tracking controller is proposed. In the proposed ARRBFN control system, a recurrent radial basis function network (RRBFN) with accurate approximation capability is used to approximate an unknown dynamic function. The adaptive learning algorithms that can learn the parameters of the RRBFN on line are derived using Lyapunov stability theorem. Moreover, a robust compensator is proposed to confront the uncertainties, including approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, higher-order terms in Taylor series. To relax the requirement of the value of the lumped uncertainty in the robust compensator, an adaptive law is investigated to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Using the proposed control scheme, the position tracking performance is substantially improved and the robustness to uncertainties, including hysteresis friction force and cross-coupling stiffness, can be obtained as well.

A vibrating PB can scavenge energy from the operating environment by the electromechanical coupling. A DDC can effectively match the optimal output voltage of the harvesting structure to the battery voltage. To raise the output power density of PB, a synchronized switch harvesting inductor (SSHI) is used in parallel with the harvesting structure to reverse the voltage through charge transfer between the output electrodes at the transition moments from closed-to open-circuit. Voltage reversal results in earlier arrival of rectifier conduction because the output voltage phases of any two adjacent closed-circuit states are just opposite each other. In principle, a PB is with a smaller, flexural stiffness under closed-circuit condition than under open-circuit condition. Thus, the PB subjected to longer closed-circuit condition will be easier to be accelerated. A larger flexural velocity makes the PB to deflect with larger amplitude, which implies that more mechanical energy will be converted into an electric one. Nonlinear interface between the vibrating PB and the modulating circuit is analyzed in detail, and the effects of SSHI and DDC on the charging efficiency of the storage battery are researched numerically. It was found that the introduction of a DDC in the modulating circuit and an SSHI in the harvesting structure can raise the charging efficiency by several times.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2008-03-13", "authors": ["YuantaiHu", "HuanXue", "TingHu", "HongpingHu"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2008.624"}

Electrophysiological maps of ventrum skin were elaborated in the same rats at 24 h after surgery and 2 weeks after parturition. Neurones with split RFs resulting from the surgical separation of formerly adjoining skin surfaces were more numerous in non-nursing than nursing rats. RFs that included newly adjacent skin surfaces on both sides of the scar line emerged in nursing rats, suggesting that the spatial contiguity of formerly separated skin surfaces induced a fusion of their cortical representations through nursing-induced stimulation.

A skin territory including recipient and translocated skin areas was costimulated for 7 h, using a brushing device. Neural responses evoked by a piezoelectric-induced skin indentation before and after skin brushing confirmed the emergence of RFs crossing the scar line and contraction of non-brushed components of split RFs.

The PCR products amplified from concentrations of 1.2 x 10(2) CFU/ml of E. coli O157:H7 were detectable by the piezoelectric biosensor. A linear correlation was found when the E. coli O157:H7 detected from 10(2) to 10(6) CFU/ml.

{"title": "Influence of oxygen partial pressure on the composition and orientation of strontium-doped lead zirconate titanate thin films.", "abstract": "The influence of oxygen partial pressure during the deposition of piezoelectric strontium-doped lead zirconate titanate thin films is reported. The thin films have been deposited by RF magnetron sputtering in an atmosphere of high purity argon and oxygen (in the ratio of 9:1), on platinum-coated silicon substrates (heated to 650 degrees C). The influence of oxygen partial pressure is studied to understand the manner in which the stoichiometry of the thin films is modified, and to understand the influence of stoichiometry on the perovskite orientation. This article reports on the results obtained from films deposited at oxygen partial pressures of 1-5 mTorr. The thin films have been studied using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GA-XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). XPS analysis highlights the marked influence of variations in oxygen pressure during sputtering, observed by variations in oxygen concentration in the thin films, and in some cases by the undesirable decrease in lead concentration in the thin films. GA-XRD is used to study the relative variations in perovskite peak intensities, and has been used to determine the deposition conditions to attain the optimal combination of stoichiometry and orientation.

{"title": "Microfibre-nanowire hybrid structure for energy scavenging.", "abstract": "A self-powering nanosystem that harvests its operating energy from the environment is an attractive proposition for sensing, personal electronics and defence technologies. This is in principle feasible for nanodevices owing to their extremely low power consumption. Solar, thermal and mechanical (wind, friction, body movement) energies are common and may be scavenged from the environment, but the type of energy source to be chosen has to be decided on the basis of specific applications. Military sensing/surveillance node placement, for example, may involve difficult-to-reach locations, may need to be hidden, and may be in environments that are dusty, rainy, dark and/or in deep forest. In a moving vehicle or aeroplane, harvesting energy from a rotating tyre or wind blowing on the body is a possible choice to power wireless devices implanted in the surface of the vehicle. Nanowire nanogenerators built on hard substrates were demonstrated for harvesting local mechanical energy produced by high-frequency ultrasonic waves. To harvest the energy from vibration or disturbance originating from footsteps, heartbeats, ambient noise and air flow, it is important to explore innovative technologies that work at low frequencies (such as <10 Hz) and that are based on flexible soft materials. Here we present a simple, low-cost approach that converts low-frequency vibration/friction energy into electricity using piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowires grown radially around textile fibres. By entangling two fibres and brushing the nanowires rooted on them with respect to each other, mechanical energy is converted into electricity owing to a coupled piezoelectric-semiconductor process. This work establishes a methodology for scavenging light-wind energy and body-movement energy using fabrics.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2008-02-15", "authors": ["YongQin", "XudongWang", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1038/nature06601"}

Activity rhythms are highly abnormal in acute phases of BPD; we compared circadian activity rhythms in BPD I patients during ill and recovered states to those of normal controls to test the hypothesis that some abnormalities may persist.\nWe compared 36 adult DSM-IV BPD I patients during acute mania or mixed states, and during full and sustained clinical recovery, to 32 healthy controls of similar age and sex distribution, using wrist-worn, piezoelectric actigraphic monitoring for 72 h and computed cosinor analysis of circadian activity rhythms.\nWe verified expected major differences between manic or mixed-state BPD I patients and matched normal controls, including phase advances averaging 2.1 h in ill BPD I patients and 1.8 h in recovered patients. Moreover, recovered BPD patients differed highly significantly from controls in several measures, including acrophase advance, higher percentage of nocturnal sleep, and lower average daily activity (mesor). Actigraphic measures among recovered BPD patients were independent of ratings of mania (on the Young Mania Rating Scale), depression (on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), or rating-scale scored subjective distress, as well as the type and dose of concurrent psychotropic medication.\nThese findings suggest that abnormal activity rhythms, including sustained phase advances, may represent enduring (trait) characteristics of BPD patients even during clinical recovery.

{"title": "[Ultrasonic bone cutting in oral surgery: a review of 60 cases].", "abstract": "Surgical reconstruction of bony defects in the oral cavity can often be challenging since thin and fragile bony structures are especially prone to fracture cased by bulky cutting tips or the application of significant pressure by conventional mechanical instruments. The risk of accidental damage to adjacent soft tissue structures, such as nerves, by a dental drill or saw is also extremely high. The use of modulated ultrasound (piezosurgery) makes it possible to overcome such complications as a result of the precise and minimally invasive surgery technique which is limited to mineralized hard tissue.\nIn 60 patients (38 male, 22 female) a piezosurgery device was used for different bone augmentation procedures before dental implant placement. The instrument uses modulated ultrasound (25 - 30 kHz) and the amplitude of the working tip ranges from 60 mum to 200 mum. The device was employed for sinus floor elevation (25), alveolar ridge augmentation using an autogenous block graft (25), alveolar ridge splitting (5) or lateralization of the alveolar nerve (5). Physiological sodium chloride was used as a cooling solution. For all osteotomies mode boosted burst c and pump 5 were used.\nPiezoelectric osteotomy permitted micrometric selective cutting and a clear surgical site due to the cavitation effect created by the cooling solution and the oscillating tip. No excessive bleeding was encountered. The risk of accidental soft tissue harm, such as perforating the sinus membrane or damaging adjacent nerves, was definitely lower than in the case of a conventional bur. No serious complications were encountered in the postoperative wound healing process after 2, 14, 30 and 90 days. However, the surgical procedures were time-consuming.\nPiezosurgery is an advantageous osteotomy technique for delicate structures in the oral and maxillofacial region. With respect to osteotomies of thin and fragile bones, the application of ultrasound is superior to other mechanical instruments because of the extremely precise and virtually arbitrary cut geometries, easy handling, efficient bone ablation and minimal accidental damage to adjacent soft tissue structures.", "journal": "Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)", "date": "2008-02-14", "authors": ["SSt\u00fcbinger", "CLandes", "OSeitz", "H-FZeilhofer", "RSader"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2007-963507"}
{"title": "Quantitative evaluation of ontogenetic change in heart rate and its autonomic regulation in newborn mice with the use of a noninvasive piezoelectric sensor.", "abstract": "A reliable basal heart rate (HR) measurement in freely moving newborn mice was accomplished for the first time by using a novel noninvasive piezoelectric transducer (PZT) sensor. The basal HR was approximately 320 beats/min at postnatal day (P)0 and increased with age to approximately 690 beats/min at P14. Contribution of autonomic control to HR was then assessed. Sympathetic blockade with metoprolol significantly reduced basal HR at both P6 (-236 +/- 23 beats/min; mean +/- SE) and P12 (-105 +/- 8 beats/min), but atropine was without effect, indicating the predominant tonic adrenergic stimulation and absence of vagal control for basal HR in newborn mice. In contrast to stable basal HR during 5-min recording, HR measured by ECG (ECG-HR) was markedly decreased because of the restraint stress of attaching ECG electrodes, with accompanying freezing behavior. ECG-HR lowered and further decreased gradually during 5 min (slow cardiodeceleration) at P0-P3 and rapidly decreased and gradually recovered within 5 min (transient bradycardia) at P9-P14. The response was not uniform in P4-P8 mice: they showed either of these two patterns or sustained bradycardia (9-29%), and the number of mice that showed transient bradycardia increased with age (30-100%) during the period. Studies with autonomic blockade suggest that the slow cardiodeceleration and transient bradycardia are mediated mainly by withdrawal of adrenergic stimulation and phasic vagal activation, respectively, and the autonomic control of HR response to restraint stress is likely to change from the withdrawal of adrenergic stimulation to the phasic vagal activation at different stages during P4-P8 in individual mice. The PZT sensor may offer excellent opportunities to monitor basal HR of small animals noninvasively.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "The effect of ultrasound on bone dimensional changes following extraction: a pilot study.", "abstract": "Because of bone resorption following tooth extraction, preservation of adequate bony dimension is performed often for subsequent treatment with dental implants. This study evaluated a novel, non-invasive treatment using ultrasound to accelerate healing following extraction to minimize alveolar bone loss. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ultrasound on the dimensional healing changes of alveolar bone following tooth extraction using cone-beam volumetric tomography (CBVT).\nThis randomized, split-mouth trial involved 12 subjects requiring extraction of two contralateral erupted permanent teeth. Baseline CBVT scans were captured 7 to 10 days following extraction, after which time ultrasound therapy commenced in test sites. Ultrasound therapy was delivered for 20 minutes using a piezoelectric transducer for 10 sessions over the subsequent 4 weeks. Follow-up radiographic scans were obtained at 4 weeks and 3 months postextraction. Analyses of variance and covariance were performed to assess dimensional changes over the 3-month healing period.\nAnalysis of dimensional changes in all measures of vertical height and horizontal width demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the ultrasound and control groups from baseline to 3 months postextraction. Evaluation of correlations between dimensional changes demonstrated a moderately strong correlation (r = 0.67; P = 0.023) in the ultrasound group between the change in buccal vertical height and the baseline crestal ridge width. Analysis of the change in buccal vertical height relative to baseline crestal width demonstrated a statistically significant benefit to ultrasound compared to control (P = 0.016). This benefit was more pronounced in wider sockets compared to narrow sockets.\nIn this pilot study, there was no significant benefit to ultrasound in absolute bony dimensional changes following tooth extraction. There was a significant interaction between the treatment rendered (ultrasound versus control) and the change in buccal ridge height relative to baseline ridge width at the crest and 3 mm apical to the crest. This benefit was apparent in wide sockets compared to narrow sockets; however, the clinical importance of these relative dimensional changes in the ultrasound group are difficult to determine given the inclusion of all tooth types in a pilot study with a small sample size.", "journal": "Journal of periodontology", "date": "2008-02-07", "authors": ["Eric NKerr", "Brian LMealey", "Marcel ENoujeim", "David JLasho", "Pirkka VNummikoski", "James TMellonig"], "doi": "10.1902/jop.2008.070289"}

{"title": "Dynamic adhesive force measurements under vertical and horizontal motions of interacting rough surfaces.", "abstract": "An instrument to measure dynamic adhesive forces between interacting rough surfaces has been developed. It consists of four parts, namely, main instrument body, vertical positioning system with both micrometer and nanometer positioning accuracies, horizontal positioning system with nanometer positioning accuracy, and custom-built high-resolution, and high dynamic bandwidth capacitive force transducer. The vertical piezoelectric actuator (PZT) controls the vertical (approaching and retracting) motion of the upper specimen, while the horizontal PZT controls the horizontal (reciprocal) motion of the lower specimen. The force transducer is placed in line with the upper specimen and vertical PZT, and directly measures the adhesive forces with a root-mean-square load resolution of 1.7 microN and a dynamic bandwidth of 1.7 kHz. The newly developed instrument enables reliable measurements of near-contact and contact adhesive forces for microscale devices under different dynamic conditions. Using the developed instrument, dynamic pull-in and pull-off force measurements were performed between an aluminum-titanium-carbide sphere and a 10 nm thick carbon film disk sample. Three different levels of contact force were investigated; where for each contact force level the vertical velocity of the upper sample was varied from 0.074 to 5.922 microms, while the lower sample was stationary. It was found that slower approaching and retracting velocities result in higher pull-in and pull-off forces.

Numerous previously known cold-sensitive mutants exhibit marked high-pressure sensitivity.

No significant difference was observed in fertilization rates between the treatments when epididymides were stored for up to 2 days, but the fertilization rates in mineral oil were higher (P<0.05) than those in the mouse body at 3 (41.4 vs. 16.2%) and 4 days (26.0 vs. 15.8%). Spermatozoa retrieved from epididymides stored in mineral oil were then used to fertilize fresh and vitrified oocytes with or without ZIP treatment. The fertilization rates of the ZIP fresh oocytes were higher than those of the zona-intact oocytes at each time point (1 to 4 days). After ZIP, the fertilization rates of spermatozoa stored for 1 and 2 days (91.2 and 86.6%, respectively) were similar (P>0.05) to that of fresh spermatozoa (91.9%). In regard to vitrified oocytes, the fertilization rates of zona-intact and ZIP oocytes using fresh spermatozoa were 46.7 and 84.7%, while the fertilization rates of vitrified ZIP oocytes using spermatozoa stored for 1 to 4 days ranged from 49.3 to 79.6%. When 2-cell embryos derived from ZIP fresh and vitrified oocytes inseminated with 2 day-stored spermatozoa were transferred into recipient females, 47.9 and 15.0% of the embryos developed to term, respectively. These results indicate that storing mouse epididymides at 4 C in mineral oil is more suitable than storage in the mouse body and that the ZIP technique improves the in vitro fertilizing ability of stored mouse spermatozoa in fresh oocytes and significantly increases the fertilization rate of vitrified oocytes with fresh spermatozoa.", "journal": "The Journal of reproduction and development", "date": "2008-02-02", "authors": ["Zhi-QiangFan", "Xiu-WeiLi", "YingLiu", "Qing-GangMeng", "Yan-PingWang", "Yun-PengHou", "Guang-BinZhou", "Shi-EnZhu"], "doi": "10.1262/jrd.19118"}
{"title": "Origin of morphotropic phase boundaries in ferroelectrics.", "abstract": "A piezoelectric material is one that generates a voltage in response to a mechanical strain (and vice versa). The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary, where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions, but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the transition is larger than any known. Our results show that the high electromechanical coupling in solid solutions with lead titanate is due to tuning of the high-pressure morphotropic phase boundary in pure lead titanate to ambient pressure. We also find that complex microstructures or compositions are not necessary to obtain strong piezoelectricity. This opens the door to the possible discovery of high-performance, pure-compound electromechanical materials, which could greatly decrease costs and expand the utility of piezoelectric materials.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2008-02-01", "authors": ["MuhtarAhart", "MaddurySomayazulu", "R ECohen", "PGanesh", "PrzemyslawDera", "Ho-kwangMao", "Russell JHemley", "YangRen", "PeterLiermann", "ZhigangWu"], "doi": "10.1038/nature06459"}

{"title": "Sterilization effects on starPEG coated polymer surfaces: characterization and cell viability.", "abstract": "Sterilization is frequently an issue for polymeric biomaterials including hydrogels, where autoclaving needs to be discarded, and gamma-irradiation and low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization are already important alternatives. Coatings based on poly(ethylene glycol) are a well-known strategy to reduce unspecific protein interactions on biomaterial surfaces. Dense, ultrathin coatings of isocyanate terminated star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG) molecules have proven to be resistant to unspecific adsorption of proteins and enable direct biofunctionalization. The effectivity and stability of the starPEG coatings on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) were studied after gamma-irradiation (normed dosis 25 kGy) and plasma sterilization (Sterrad 100S). The selected surface properties determined were: surface composition (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS), wettability (sessile drop contact angle) and protein adsorption by fluorescence microscopy (Avidin-TexasRed, Bovine Serum Albumin-Rhodamin). Preliminary cell experiments with the cell line L929 were performed prior and after sterilization to investigate the cell repellence of the starPEG coatings as well as cell viability and specific cell adhesion on GRGDS-modified coatings. The starPEG coating undergoes a slight oxidation due to plasma and gamma-sterilization; this represents a minor variation confirmed by XPS and contact angle results. The non-sterilized starPEG and the plasma-sterilized coatings are protein repellent, however the protein adsorption on starPEG coated substrates is much stronger after gamma-sterilization for both avidin and bovine serum albumin. The cell experiments indicate that the starPEG coatings are appliable homogeneously by incubation and are non-cell adherent. Moreover, after both sterilization processes the starPEG coatings remain cell repellent and the GRGDS-modified coatings presented vital cells. Thus we conclude that the plasma sterilization is more convenient for the starPEG coatings and GRGDS-modified starPEG coatings.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

In this paper, the formation of poly-L-lysine/hydroxyapatite/carbon nanotube (PLL/HA/CNT) hybrid nanoparticles is described and a general design strategy for an immunosensing platform has been proposed on the basis of PLL/HA/CNT nanocomposite adsorption of antibodies. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) used as a model transducer and the detection performances of the resulting immunosensor were investigated by use of the immuno-system of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), an important indicator in the diagnosis of clinical cancers. The hybrid nanocomposite was characterized by the transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectrum measurements. The frequency response characteristics for the processes of immobilization and immunoreaction of anchored anti-CA19-9 antibodies were studied in detail. It was found that the developed sensing interface has some advantages such as the activation-free immobilization and the high antigen-binding activities of antibodies.

PVDF membrane allowed slightly clearer visualization of the proteins with DAB method as compared with nitrocellulose and nylon membranes, and on the latter two membranes, quick protein transfer was likely to result in somehow irregular bands in comparison with slow protein transfer. With slow protein transfer and chemiluminescence for visualization, all the 3 membranes showed clear background, while with quick protein transfer, nylon membrane gave rise to obvious background noise but the other two membranes did not.\nDifferent membranes should be selected for immunoblotting according to the actual needs of the experiment.

Both a piezoelectric buzzer and a gap circle on a silver electrode of the buzzer are needed to build any type of the PTs. Here, the gap circle is used to form a ring-shaped input electrode and a circle-shaped output electrode for each piezoelectric transformer. To do so, both structure and connection of a PT are first expressed. Then, operating principle of a PT and its related vibration mode observed by a carbon-power imaging technique are described.

{"title": "Currents in response to rapid concentration jumps of amphetamine uncover novel aspects of human dopamine transporter function.", "abstract": "Amphetamine (AMPH) is a widely abused psychostimulant that acts as a substrate for the human dopamine transporter (hDAT). Using a piezoelectric rapid application system, we measured AMPH-induced currents mediated by hDAT. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a heterologous expression system reveal that AMPH induces a rapidly activating and subsequently decaying inward current mediated by hDAT. We hypothesize that this transient inward current reflects a conformational change associated with substrate translocation. The AMPH-induced current strictly depends on extracellular Na+. Elevated intracellular Na+ has no effect on the peak AMPH-induced current amplitude but inhibits the steady-state current. In addition, elevated intracellular Na+ causes an overshoot outward current upon washout of AMPH that reflects hDAT locked in a Na+-exchange mode. Furthermore, elevated intracellular Na+ dramatically accelerates the recovery time from desensitization of the AMPH-induced current, revealing a new role for intracellular Na+ in promoting the transition to the hDAT \"outward-facing\" conformation. Ion substitution suggests that both extracellular and intracellular Cl- facilitate transporter turnover in contrast to the classical model of Cl- as a cotransported ion. We present an alternating-access model of hDAT function that accurately fits the main features of the experimental data. The model predicts that translocation of substrate occurs within milliseconds of substrate binding but that slow reorientation of the empty transporter is the rate-limiting factor for turnover. The model provides a framework for interpreting perturbations of hDAT activity.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2008-01-25", "authors": ["KevinErreger", "ChristofGrewer", "Jonathan AJavitch", "AurelioGalli"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2796-07.2008"}

When a film of such a polymer is compressed, charge is generated across its thickness, and conversely, applying an oscillatory or static potential elicits mechanical motions. This dual sensor-actuator behaviour can be embedded in one material and presents distinct advantages of functional integration. A novel electroactive foam is presented here that embeds such a sensor-actuator function. The foam has a sensitivity constant (d(33)) of 330\u00a0pC\u00a0N(-1). Interestingly, the resonant behaviour of the cellular film can be altered by variation in the DC offset across the material.

For studies at 250 and 600 s(-1), TF firmly adsorbed was exposed to flowing anticoagulated blood in flat perfusion devices. Deposition of platelets and fibrin were evaluated by morphometric, immunocytochemical and ultrastructural methods. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) levels were also measured. Experiments at 5000 s(-1), were performed on the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100) with experimental cartridges with collagen (COL) or collagen-hTF (COL + TF). Haemostatic effect of recombinant activated FVIIa (rFVIIa) was assessed in the same experimental settings.\nPlatelet deposition on hTF reached 19.8 +/- 1.3% and 26.1 +/- 3.4% of the total surface, at 250 and 600 s(-1), respectively. Fibrin formation was significantly higher at 250 s(-1) than at 600 s(-1) (P < 0.05). The addition of rFVIIa did not influence platelet deposition but raised fibrin formation and thrombin generation at both shear rates (P < 0.05).

{"title": "Changes in EMG and Finger Force with Repeated Hangs from the Hands in Rock Climbers.", "abstract": "The nature and degree of fatigue in muscles that control finger position during repeated sustained efforts in rock climbing have not been described. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in maximum hang time and forearm electromyogram (EMG) during repeated maximum duration hangs from a simulated rock feature. A second objective was to determine the effect of different recovery times between hangs upon changes in finger force. Five experienced rock climbers performed 2 test sessions on different days in a randomized order. Each session involved 8 repetitions of a maximum duration hang with either 1 min (R1) or 3 min (R3) resting recovery between hangs. Finger force (FF) was measured for the right hand via a piezoelectric force sensor fitted with a plate to accept the distal digits of four fingers. Peak EMG (EMGPK) and EMG Area (EMGAREA) were recorded from the anterior forearm for each hang and standardized as percent of maximum FF EMG prior to statistical analysis. Hang duration progressively decreased over repetitions but tended to plateau around repetition 5 for both R1 and R3 conditions. A significant difference was found for both recovery conditions and repetitions (p<.05) as well as a significant interaction of the two factors (p<.05) for hang duration. There were no significant differences for EMGPK among repetitions or between recovery conditions (p>.05). EMGAREA decreased initially with repeated hangs during both R1 and R3 but this trend tended to plateau at repetition 3 for the R3 condition. A significant difference was found in EMGAREA for both recovery conditions and trials (p<.05) as well as a significant interaction of the two factors (p<.05). Mean FF decreased between pre- and post-hangs for both R1 and R3 however the difference was not significant. It was concluded that the overall decline in hang time is less with 3 min recovery vs 1 min recovery between hangs. Peak EMG does not appear to change despite this evidence of fatigue. A 3 min recovery interval between hang repetitions decreases the magnitude of fatigue experienced and enables a greater EMGAREA per hang.", "journal": "International journal of exercise science", "date": "2008-01-01", "authors": ["Phillip BWatts", "Randall LJensen", "Sara MAgena", "John AMajchrzak", "Rebecca ASchellinger", "Cory SWubbels"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Microfluidic Photonic Integrated Circuits.", "abstract": "We report on the development of an inexpensive, portable lab-on-a-chip flow cytometer system in which microfluidics, photonics, and acoustics are integrated together to work synergistically. The system relies on fluid-filled two-dimensional on-chip photonic components such as lenses, apertures, and slab waveguides to allow for illumination laser beam shaping, light scattering and fluorescence signal detection. Both scattered and fluorescent lights are detected by photodetectors after being collected and guided by the on-chip optics components (e.g. lenses and waveguides). The detected light signal is imported and amplified in real time and triggers the piezoelectric actuator so that the targeted samples are directed into desired reservoir for subsequent advanced analysis. The real-time, closed-loop control system is developed with field-programmable-gate-array (FPGA) implementation. The system enables high-throughput (1-10kHz operation), high reliability and low-powered (<1mW) fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on a chip.

{"title": "Fluid dynamical analysis of the distribution of ink jet printed biomolecules in microarray substrates for genotyping applications.", "abstract": "Oligonucleotide microarrays are tools used to analyze samples for the presence of specific DNA sequences. In the system as presented here, specific DNA sequences are first amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during which process they are labeled with fluorophores. The amplicons are subsequently hybridized onto an oligonucleotide microarray, which in our case is a porous nylon membrane with microscopic spots. Each spot on the membrane contains oligonucleotides with a sequence complementary to part of one specific target sequence. The solution containing the amplicons flows by external agitation many times up and down through the porous substrate, thereby reducing the time delaying effect of diffusion. By excitation of the fluorophores the emitted pattern of fluorophores can be detected by a charge-coupled device camera. The recorded pattern is a characteristic of the composition of the sample. The oligonucleotide capture probes have been deposited on the substrate by using noncontact piezo ink jet printing, which is the focus of our study. The objective of this study is to understand the mechanisms that determine the distribution of the ink jet printed capture probes inside the membrane. The membrane is a porous medium: the droplets placed on the membrane penetrate in the microstructure of it. The three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the capture probes inside the membrane determines the distribution of the hybridized fluorescent PCR products inside the membrane and thus the emission of light when exposed to the light source. As the 3D distribution of the capture probes inside the membrane eventually determines the detection efficiency, this parameter can be controlled for optimization of the sensitivity of the assay. The main issues addressed here are how are the capture probes distributed inside the membrane and how does this distribution depend on the printing parameters. We will use two model systems to study the influences of different parameters: a single nozzle print head jetting large droplets at a low frequency and a multinozzle print head emitting small droplets at a high frequency. In particular, we have investigated the effects when we change from usage of the first system to the second system. Furthermore, we will go into detail how we can obtain smaller spot sizes in order to increase the spot density without having overlapping spots, leading eventually to lower manufacturing costs of microarrays. By controlling the main print parameters influencing the 3D distribution inside the porous medium, the overall batch-to-batch variations can possibly be reduced.", "journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "date": "2008-01-01", "authors": ["J FritsDijksman", "AnkePierik"], "doi": "10.1063/1.2994715\n10.1016/j.bioeng.2005.09.003\n10.1016/j.ces.2004.02.006\n10.1016/j.cis.2004.07.007\n10.1021/la0268348\n10.1146/annurev.fluid.38.050304.092144\n10.1017/S0022112095002266\n10.1063/1.868850\n10.1021/la971301y\n10.1063/1.1773551\n10.1063/1.1793071\n10.1063/1.1928828\n10.1063/1.2038367\n10.1017/S002211200700554X\n10.1016/0021-9797(79)90081-X\n10.1021/bi00455a030\n10.1063/1.459904\n10.1126/science.2000490\n10.1073/pnas.90.9.3835\n10.1006/jcph.1997.5765\n10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00391-3"}

{"title": "Decreased astroglial cell adhesion and proliferation on zinc oxide nanoparticle polyurethane composites.", "abstract": "Nanomaterials offer a number of properties that are of interest to the field of neural tissue engineering. Specifically, materials that exhibit nanoscale surface dimensions have been shown to promote neuron function while simultaneously minimizing the activity of cells such as astrocytes that inhibit central nervous system regeneration. Studies demonstrating enhanced neural tissue regeneration in electrical fields through the use of conductive materials have led to interest in piezoelectric materials (or those materials which generate a transient electrical potential when mechanically deformed) such as zinc oxide (ZnO). It has been speculated that ZnO nanoparticles possess increased piezoelectric properties over ZnO micron particles. Due to this promise in neural applications, the objective of the present in vitro study was, for the first time, to assess the activity of astroglial cells on ZnO nanoparticle polymer composites. ZnO nanoparticles embedded in polyurethane were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy to evaluate nanoscale surface features of the composites. The surface chemistry was characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Astroglial cell response was evaluated based on cell adhesion and proliferation. Astrocyte adhesion was significantly reduced on ZnO nanoparticle/polyurethane (PU) composites with a weight ratio of 50:50 (PU:ZnO) wt.%, 75:25 (PU:ZnO) wt.%, and 90:10 (PU:ZnO) wt.% in comparison to pure PU.

{"title": "Identification of hepatocellular-carcinoma-associated antigens and autoantibodies by serological proteome analysis combined with protein microarray.", "abstract": "To comprehensively study autoantibodies in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we used an approach-based serology and proteomics technologies. Total proteins extracted from HepG2 cells and HepG2.2.15 cells were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, which were subsequently incubated with sera from HCC patients or from normal controls. As a result, 13 HCC-associated antigens were identified. Antigenicity of eight proteins was further confirmed using recombinant proteins by Western blotting (WB) and protein microarray. The results of antigen microarray analysis showed strong signals of keratin 8 and lamin A/C in chronic hepatitis controls; therefore, the autoantibodies to keratin 8 and lamin A/C may not be HCC-specific. These two antigens were removed from subsequent analyses. The frequencies of positive reactions to DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 3, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2), prostatic binding protein, and triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) were significantly higher in HCC than in chronic hepatitis and normal individuals. Positive reactions to DEAD box polypeptide 3, eEF2, AIF, and prostatic binding protein were significantly more frequent in HCC than in any other cancer. The sensitivity of any individual antigen in HCC at stage I ranged from 50 to 85%. When the combinations of six antigens were analyzed, the sensitivity increased to 90%.

The formation of a Schottky diode at the interface is a must for the effective operation of the NG. UV light not only increases the carrier density in ZnO but also reduces the barrier height. A reduced barrier height greatly weakens the function of the barrier for preserving the piezoelectric potential in the NW for an extended period of time, resulting in little output current. An increased carrier density speeds up the rate at which the piezoelectric charges are screened/neutralized, but a very low carrier density prevents the flow of current through the NWs. Therefore, there is an optimum conductance of the NW for maximizing the output of the NG. Our study provides solid evidence to further prove the mechanism proposed for the piezoelectric NG and piezotronics.

In comparison to the ZnO wire/belt without oligomer coating, an extra positive voltage peak was observed prior to the appearance of a negative potential peak. The paired positive and negative voltage peaks are the results of tip contact to the stretched and the compressed side of the wire/belt, corresponding to the positive and negative local piezoelectric potential, respectively. The p-n junction between OPV2 and ZnO serves as a \"diode\" that controls the flow of current. When the nanowire/nanobelt is first bent by the AFM tip, the diode is reversely biased and the piezoelectric charges are stored in the ZnO wire/belt. As the AFM tip further bends the wire/belt, the local piezoelectric potential is continuously accumulated to a value that is large enough to break through the diode. Then the free charges from the external circuit can flow in and neutralize/screen part of the piezoelectric charges, resulting in a positive pulse in the output signal. When the AFM tip continues to scan to reach the compressed side of the ZnO wire/belt, the p-n junction is forwardly biased. Neutralizing/screening the residual and the newly created piezoelectric charges leads to the flow of current from the tip to the ZnO wire/belt, resulting in a negative voltage pulse.

For this purpose, the wave-like pattern of the liquid-liquid interface is produced in the microchannel. In this technique, the high frequency of the wave-like pattern is necessary for reducing the length of the mixing path. High frequency of the wave-like pattern is achieved by employing the newly developed microvalve using tailor-made multilayer piezoelectric actuators (TAMPA) that is compact yet produces large displacements and forces. This paper first details the concept for the concentration gradient generation method. Next, a microvalve (20 x 15 x 15 mm) was designed and produced using TAMPA (8.5 x 10 x 10 mm). Finally, a concentration gradient in two-layered flow was generated with the microvalve. As a result, the generation of a concentration gradient in two-layered flow with active mixing was achieved.

{"title": "An insight into the sialome of the soft tick, Ornithodorus parkeri.", "abstract": "While hard ticks (Ixodidae) take several days to feed on their hosts, soft ticks (Argasidae) feed faster, usually taking less than 1h per meal. Saliva assists in the feeding process by providing a cocktail of anti-hemostatic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodullatory compounds. Saliva of hard ticks has been shown to contain several families of genes each having multiple members, while those of soft ticks are relatively unexplored. Analysis of the salivary transcriptome of the soft tick Ornithodorus parkeri, the vector of the relapsing fever agent Borrelia parkeri, indicates that gene duplication events have led to a large expansion of the lipocalin family, as well as of several genes containing Kunitz domains indicative of serine protease inhibitors, and several other gene families also found in hard ticks. Novel protein families with sequence homology to insulin growth factor-binding protein (prostacyclin-stimulating factor), adrenomedulin, serum amyloid A protein precursor and similar to HIV envelope protein were also characterized for the first time in the salivary gland of a blood-sucking arthropod. The sialotranscriptome of O. parkeri confirms that gene duplication events are an important driving force in the creation of salivary cocktails of blood-feeding arthropods, as was observed with hard ticks and mosquitoes. Most of the genes coding for expanded families are homologous to those found in hard ticks, indicating a strong common evolutionary path between the two families.

PvdS activity is modulated by pyoverdine through the surface signalling cascade involving the FpvA receptor and the inner membrane-spanning sensor FpvR. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms enabling PvdS to compete with the major sigma RpoD for RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding, we determined the intracellular levels of RNAP, RpoD and PvdS in P. aeruginosa PAO1, and the effect of pyoverdine signalling on PvdS activity. Under iron limitation, P. aeruginosa contains 2221 and 933 molecules of RNAP and RpoD per cell respectively. PvdS attains 62% of RpoD levels. The high PvdS content is partly offset by retention of 30% of PvdS on the membrane, lowering the concentration of cytosolic PvdS to 45% of RpoD levels. RNAP purification from iron-starved P. aeruginosa cells demonstrated that PvdS-RNAP is poorly represented compared with RpoD-RNAP (1 and 27% of total RNAP respectively). Pyoverdine signalling does not affect the PvdS cellular content but facilitates PvdS release from the membrane, increasing its cytosolic concentration from 35% in both pvdF and fpvA signalling mutants to 70% in the wild type and 83% in the fpvR mutant.", "journal": "Molecular microbiology", "date": "2007-12-01", "authors": ["FedericaTiburzi", "FrancescoImperi", "PaoloVisca"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.06051.x"}
{"title": "Developmental changes of mechanics measured in the gerbil cochlea.", "abstract": "This report describes stiffness and best frequency measurements obtained in vitro from the basilar membrane of the gerbil cochlea at the onset of hearing, during hearing maturation, and after hearing has matured. Our stiffness data constitute the first direct experimental evidence of developmental stiffness changes in the basal and middle turns. Stiffness changes by a factor of 5.5 in the basal turn between postnatal day 11 and adult, and the difference from adult is statistically significant for all ages measured up to postnatal day 16. For the middle turn, stiffness changes by a factor of 1.6 between postnatal day 11 and adult. Whereas for postnatal day 12 and beyond there is no statistically significant difference from adult, our data suggest that there may be a significant difference of stiffness between day 11 and adult in the middle turn. For the basal turn, our motion measurements confirm a passive component to the developmental best frequency shift. For the middle turn, changes in best frequency are not statistically significant. Best frequency was determined by stimulating the tissue at audio frequencies with a glass paddle and measuring motion with a computer-based imaging system. Tissue stiffness was measured with a piezoelectric-based sensor system. Tissue stiffness changes have previously been postulated to contribute to the best frequency shift observed in the cochlear base. Incorporating our data into a simple spring-mass resonance model demonstrates that our experimentally measured stiffness change can account for the change of best frequency. These results suggest that a stiffness change is, in fact, a critical component of the best frequency shift observed in the basal turn of the gerbil cochlea after the onset of hearing.", "journal": "Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology : JARO", "date": "2007-11-30", "authors": ["GulamEmadi", "Claus-PeterRichter"], "doi": "10.1007/s10162-007-0104-9\n10.1016/0378-5955(88)90149-9\n10.1007/BF01420984\n10.1038/341147a0\n10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00090-2\n10.1152/jn.00446.2003\n10.1007/BF00056772\n10.1121/1.387144\n10.1126/science.6463651\n10.1016/0378-5955(94)90046-9\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/4/310\n10.1016/0378-5955(95)00015-V\n10.1121/1.392041\n10.1121/1.415857\n10.1121/1.417985\n10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00079-3\n10.1016/0378-5955(95)00230-8\n10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00133-6\n10.1016/0378-5955(91)90008-W\n10.1121/1.408331\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.025205\n10.1159/000067892\n10.1121/1.1914569\n10.1007/s101620010019\n10.1016/0378-5955(96)00063-9\n10.1016/0378-5955(84)90081-9\n10.1016/0378-5955(85)90011-5\n10.1016/0378-5955(89)90146-9"}

The characteristics of the processes including the thickening efficiency, effluent water quality and filtration properties of the membrane for sludge thickening process (MST), digestion efficiency, effluent water quality and membrane permeability of the membrane for sludge simultaneous thickening and digestion process (MSTD) were investigated. Test results showed that good sludge thickening efficiency and superior effluent water quality were obtained in the MST process under hydraulic retention time (HRT) 0.26 and 2 d operation of each cycle, and the membrane fouling was mainly due to the increase of apparent viscosity of mixed liquors and the decrease of the cross-flow velocity (CFV) along membrane surfaces during one thickening cycle. Membranes were also selected for the processes and M1 membrane of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) material with pore size 0.2 microm demonstrated better permeability compared with other three membranes.

{"title": "Electrosonic ejector microarray for drug and gene delivery.", "abstract": "We report on development and experimental characterization of a novel cell manipulation device-the electrosonic ejector microarray-which establishes a pathway for drug and/or gene delivery with control of biophysical action on the length scale of an individual cell. The device comprises a piezoelectric transducer for ultrasound wave generation, a reservoir for storing the sample mixture and a set of acoustic horn structures that form a nozzle array for focused application of mechanical energy. The nozzles are micromachined in silicon or plastic using simple and economical batch fabrication processes. When the device is driven at a particular resonant frequency of the acoustic horn structures, the sample mixture of cells and desired transfection agents/molecules suspended in culture medium is ejected from orifices located at the nozzle tips. During sample ejection, focused mechanical forces (pressure and shear) are generated on a microsecond time scale (dictated by nozzle size/geometry and ejection velocity) resulting in identical \"active\" microenvironments for each ejected cell. This process enables a number of cellular bioeffects, from uptake of small molecules and gene delivery/transfection to cell lysis. Specifically, we demonstrate successful calcein uptake and transfection of DNA plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) into human malignant glioma cells (cell line LN443) using electrosonic microarrays with 36, 45 and 50 mum diameter nozzle orifices and operating at ultrasound frequencies between 0.91 and 0.98 MHz.

A facile and rapid method for the characterization of substrate specificities of polysaccharide-active enzymes that uses matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been developed. This method has been applied to characterize a xyloglucan fucosyltransferase and a pectin methyl-esterase. Reactions were performed in liquid phase, and aliquots of the reaction mixtures were spotted on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Reaction products were precipitated onto the membrane and cleaned by treatment with an ethanol-water mixture. Subsequently, the reaction products were hydrolyzed by specific endoglycanases, and the resulting oligosaccharides were directly analyzed onto the PVDF membrane by MALDI-TOF MS.

The PNA probe can combine to target DNA sequences more effectively and specifically than a DNA probe. The PNA probe was designed and immobilized on the surface of the biosensor to substitute the conventional DNA probe for direct detection of HBV genomic DNA without previous amplification by PCR. The hybridization assay was completed in 50 min. The detection limit was 8.6 pg/L and the clinical specificity was 94.44% compared with real time-PCR (RT-PCR). The PNA probe was able to distinguish sequences that differ only in one base. Detection sensitivity can be improved and detection time can be decreased by adding RecA protein-coated complementary ssDNA which complement to HBV gene regions.

The adhesion and proliferation of MCF-7 cells (human breast cancer cell line) on the film were investigated. It was found that cells cultured on this film could attach and spread more rapidly than on glass, ITO and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), and thus the film was demonstrated to be a good adhering substrate. MTT experimental results show that the viability of cells cultured on this film is higher than on TCPS, and fluorescence microscopic observation indicates that cells cultured on the film are not under apoptosis.

The proliferation and condition of cells on the surface of the film-modified quartz crystal gold electrode were investigated through fluorescence microscopic observation.

However, it is also important to understand the forces exerted on the pedals. The purpose of this report was to compare pedal forces during cycling between adolescents with and without cerebral palsy.\nTen subjects (3 male, 7 female) with spastic diplegic or quadriplegic cerebral palsy (15.6 years, SD 1.8) and 10 subjects (3 male, 7 female) with typical development (14.9 years, SD 1.4) cycled on a stationary recumbent cycle at 30 and 60 revolutions per minute if able. Three-dimensional piezoelectric force transducers measured pedal forces. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVAs.\nSubjects with cerebral palsy spent a smaller percentage (P<.001, r2=.09, power=1.0) of the revolution applying positive force (pushing into the pedal during the extension phase) and a greater percentage (P<.001, r2=.09, power=1.0) of the revolution applying negative force (pulling away from the pedal during the flexion phase). There was no effect of cadence and no interaction effect.\nThese findings compliment our earlier findings of altered joint kinematics and muscle activity indicating that subjects with cerebral palsy and typical development have different cycling strategies.

To clarify this issue, the ability of the filter trap approach to quantify aggregation of purified recombinant full-length tau protein in vitro was examined as a function of membrane chemistry in a 96-well format. Results showed that nitrocellulose yielded the greatest assay sensitivity relative to polyvinylidene fluoride or cellulose acetate at equal membrane porosity. However, all combinations of filter chemistries, porosities, and monoclonal detection antibodies yielded nonlinear correlations between signal intensity and analyte concentration. When corrected for nonlinearity, the filter trap assay determined a value for the critical monomer concentration for tau aggregation that was statistically identical to determinations made by electron microscopy assay.

It is shown that the amplitude of the pulse has a small influence on cell survivability with regression analysis showing cell survival rates falling from 98% with a 40 V pulse (indistinguishable from control measurements) to approximately 94% with a 80 V pulse. The rise time of the pulse was found to have no influence on cell survival. Cell viability post-printing was also assessed using the Alamar Blue metabolic assay and the cells that survived were unaffected by the printing process, with neither pulse amplitude nor rise time showing any significant influence on cell viability (using the standard 5% probability threshold).

These potentials arise as a result of activation of the sacculus and are expressed through the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). Up to now, the ascending projections of the sacculus are unknown in humans, only the representation of the semicircular canals or the entire vestibular nerve has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine whether a sacculus stimulus that evoked VEMPs could activate vestibular cortical areas in fMRI. To determine this, we studied the differential effects of unilateral VEMP stimulation in 21 healthy right-handers in a clinical 1.5 T scanner while wearing piezo electric headphones. A unilateral VEMP stimulus and two auditory control stimuli were given in randomized order over the stimulated ear. A random effects statistical analysis was done with SPM2 (p<0.05, corrected). After exclusion of the auditory effects, the major findings were as follows: (i) significant activations were located in the multisensory cortical vestibular network within both hemispheres, including the posterior insular cortex, the middle and superior temporal gyri, and the inferior parietal cortex. (ii) The activation pattern was elicited bilaterally with a predominance of the right hemisphere in right-handers. (iii) Saccular vestibular projection was predominantly ipsilateral, whereas (iv) pure acoustic stimuli were processed with a predominance of the respective contralateral and mainly in the left hemisphere. This is the first demonstration by means of fMRI of the cortical representation of the saccular input at cortical level. The activation pattern is similar to that known from the stimulation of the entire vestibular nerve or the horizontal semicircular canal.

The device is made entirely of nonferrous materials and consists of four piezoelectric ceramic plates connected to a threaded metal tube through which a screw migrates. Ultrasonic vibrations of the threads inherent to the tube result in rotational and translational motion of the screw. Potential applications of the piezoelectric motor were investigated at 4.7 T. Firstly, phantom studies showed the motor was capable of accurately delivering low injection volumes ( approximately 0.01 ml). Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) studies performed in vivo using serially acquired T1-weighted, spin-echo imaging demonstrated the ability of the motor to reliably administer MR contrast-enhancing agent into live tumor-bearing mice without the introduction of image artifacts. In a second set of experiments, the motor allowed for controlled, dynamic repositioning of an anatomic slice of interest in a live animal to magnetic field isocenter, which resulted in reduced geometric distortion and image artifact due to improved radiofrequency and gradient field homogeneity.

{"title": "Superficial topography of wound: a determinant of underlying biological events?", "abstract": "Three-dimensional configuration of wounds varies considerably according to the etiology. Wounding of skin is proceeded by release of dermal pretension. Subsequent disruption of physical equilibrium with resulting development of force vectors alters the primary shape of wound to maintain a new dynamic physical equilibrium. This leads to the development of stress-relaxation and stress-concentration areas throughout the wound milieu. Mechanical strain produces piezoelectric current which is maximal in stress-relaxation regions due to lower tissue stiffness and higher mobility. Early surge in the tissue level of TGF-beta would be exaggerated through synergistic interaction with piezoelectric current in stress-relaxation areas. Subsequently, fibroblasts migrate to these areas due to galvanotaxis. The gradual dissipation of tissue tension, due to irreversible loss of viscous strain, reduces the synergistic action of TGF-beta and piezoelectricity. However, a similar pattern of activity of TGF-beta due to the polarized migration of fibroblasts, which are the main source of TGF-beta during secondary surge, may be continued. It seems that a biological-mechanical continuum exists for wounds so that even the superficial topography of wounds may affect the underlying biological activity and final healing outcome during healing of dermal wounds.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-09-11", "authors": ["Ramin Mostofi ZadehFarahani", "Naser AslAminabadi", "Luther CKloth"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2007.05.056"}
{"title": "Effect of membrane character and solution chemistry on microfiltration performance.", "abstract": "To help understand and predict the role of natural organic matter (NOM) in the fouling of low-pressure membranes, experiments were carried out with an apparatus that incorporates automatic backwashing and long filtration runs. Three hollow fibre membranes of varying character were included in the study, and the filtration of two different surface waters was compared. The hydrophilic membrane had greater flux recovery after backwashing than the hydrophobic membranes, but the efficiency of backwashing decreased at extended filtration times. NOM concentration of these waters (7.9 and 9.1mg/L) had little effect on the flux of the membranes at extended filtration times, as backwashing of the membrane restored the flux to similar values regardless of the NOM concentration. The solution pH also had little effect at extended filtration times. The backwashing efficiency of the hydrophilic membrane was dramatically different for the two waters, and the presence of colloid NOM alone could not explain these differences. It is proposed that colloidal NOM forms a filter cake on the surface of the membranes and that small molecular weight organics that have an adsorption peak at 220nm but not 254nm were responsible for \"gluing\" the colloids to the membrane surface.

The thermodynamic approach shows that some terms of driving force are proportional to the stress, and some acting on material inhomogeneities are quadratic in the stress-the latter outweigh by far the former.

A metal-coated fibre-tip is used as a sensor and a heterodyne interferometer detects the change in the optical path resulting from the movement of the fibre-tip in the sound field. Spectrally resolved sound field parameters such as the fundamental, the subharmonic or cavitation noise are extracted from the measurements and compared with results obtained by a piezo-electric hydrophone. It was found that the fibre sensor provides a signal related to the velocity in the sound field, but the information about cavitation-related parameters is similar to the information for pressure sensing techniques. The fibre-optic sensors have a uniquely high spatial resolution and the sound detection process is strongly influenced by single cavitation events close to the small fibre-tip. This paper shows that fibre-tip sensors are an alternative to common hydrophone techniques. They can open up new possibilities for measurement problems for which so far no solution exists, in particular when a high spatial resolution is required or when the measurement site is small.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2007-07-24", "authors": ["ChristianKoch", "Klaus-VitoldJenderka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2007.05.007"}
{"title": "Dispensing an enzyme-conjugated solution into an ELISA plate by adapting ink-jet printers.", "abstract": "The rapid and precise delivery of small volumes of bio-fluids (from picoliters to nanoliters) is a key feature of modern bioanalytical assays. Commercial ink-jet printers are low-cost systems which enable the dispensing of tiny droplets at a rate which may exceed 10(4) Hz per nozzle. Currently, the main ejection technologies are piezoelectric and bubble-jet. We adapted two commercial printers, respectively a piezoelectric and a bubble-jet one, for the deposition of immunoglobulins into an ELISA plate. The objective was to perform a comparative evaluation of the two classes of ink-jet technologies in terms of required hardware modifications and possible damage on the dispensed molecules. The hardware of the two printers was modified to dispense an enzyme conjugate solution, containing polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgG labelled with HRP in 7 wells of an ELISA plate. Moreover, the ELISA assay was used to assess the functional activity of the biomolecules after ejection. ELISA is a common and well-assessed technique to detect the presence of particular antigens or antibodies in a sample. We employed an ELISA diagnostic kit for the qualitative screening of anti-ENA antibodies to verify the ability of the dispensed immunoglobulins to bind the primary antibodies in the wells. Experimental tests showed that the dispensing of immunoglobulins using the piezoelectric printer does not cause any detectable difference on the outcome of the ELISA test if compared to manual dispensing using micropipettes. On the contrary, the thermal printhead was not able to reliably dispense the bio-fluid, which may mean that a surfactant is required to modify the wetting properties of the liquid.", "journal": "Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods", "date": "2007-06-26", "authors": ["LucaLonini", "DinoAccoto", "SilviaPetroni", "EugenioGuglielmelli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbbm.2007.05.003"}
{"title": "Isolation of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins from placenta of the American bison (Bison bison) at first half of pregnancy.", "abstract": "This paper describes the successful purification and characterisation of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) extracted from placenta (3-4 months) of American bisons (Amb). Chorionic AmbPAG proteins were purified from foetal cotyledonary tissues (CT) and liquid cotyledonary-carrying proteins (LCP) leaking from damaged cells. Our protocols successfully indicated the usefulness of AmbPAG protein identification, especially from LCP fraction. The AmbPAGs were extracted, precipitated and eluted during DEAE cellulose chromatography. The richest protein fractions were further chromatographed on VVA (Vicia villosa agglutinin affinity column), then characterised by mono- and bi-dimensional electrophoresis, Western blot and N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence. After being transferred to PVDF membranes, three selected VVA-purified AmbPAG isoforms differing in molecular masses and isoelectric points (Ip 4-4.6) were selected for sequencing. One identified N-terminal 25aa sequence of AmbPAG72kDa CT form was identified as completely new (RGSNLTSLPLQNVIDLFYVGNITIG). Two other AmbPAG proteins purified from different sources (74kDa CT and 76kDa LCP forms; RGSNLTIHPLRNIRDIFYVGNITIG) were identical or corresponded to N-terminus of various bovine PAGs (boPAG). The two AmbPAGs (74kDa CT and 76kDa LCP) revealed identical micro-sequence to boPAG7; and were similar mainly to bovine PAG4, -6, -15 and -17 precursors that were identified by full-length sequencing derived from cDNA cloning. The novel sequence of the AmbPAG (72kDa CT) was related to some boPAG and various other ruminant PAG precursors (caprine and ovine). All three identified AmbPAG sequences were also relatively similar to mature forms of purified native boPAG(56-75kDa) proteins. This is the first report indicating aa sequences of native AmbPAG proteins purified from placenta (CT and LCP) of bison species. The N-terminal sequences of the AmbPAGs have been deposited in the EMBL-EBI database (UniProtKB; Accession Nos.: P84916, P84917 and P84918).", "journal": "General and comparative endocrinology", "date": "2007-06-05", "authors": ["JolantaKiewisz", "Noelita Melo deSousa", "Jean-FrancoisBeckers", "HildeVervaecke", "GrzegorzPanasiewicz", "BozenaSzafranska"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ygcen.2007.04.011"}
