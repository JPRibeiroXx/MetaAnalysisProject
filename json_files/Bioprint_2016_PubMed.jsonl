{"title": "Infrared thermography of welding zones produced by polymer extrusion additive manufacturing.", "abstract": "In common thermoplastic additive manufacturing (AM) processes, a solid polymer filament is melted, extruded though a rastering nozzle, welded onto neighboring layers and solidified. The temperature of the polymer at each of these stages is the key parameter governing these non-equilibrium processes, but due to its strong spatial and temporal variations, it is difficult to measure accurately. Here we utilize infrared (IR) imaging - in conjunction with necessary reflection corrections and calibration procedures - to measure these temperature profiles of a model polymer during 3D printing. From the temperature profiles of the printed layer (road) and sublayers, the temporal profile of the crucially important weld temperatures can be obtained. Under typical printing conditions, the weld temperature decreases at a rate of approximately 100 \u00b0C/s and remains above the glass transition temperature for approximately 1 s. These measurement methods are a first step in the development of strategies to control and model the printing processes and in the ability to develop models that correlate critical part strength with material and processing parameters.", "journal": "Additive manufacturing", "date": "2017-11-24", "authors": ["Jonathan ESeppala", "Kalman DMigler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.addma.2016.06.007"}

{"title": "Finite Element Simulation and Additive Manufacturing of Stiffness-Matched NiTi Fixation Hardware for Mandibular Reconstruction Surgery.", "abstract": "Process parameters and post-processing heat treatment techniques have been developed to produce both shape memory and superelastic NiTi using Additive Manufacturing. By introducing engineered porosity, the stiffness of NiTi can be tuned to the level closely matching cortical bone. Using additively manufactured porous superelastic NiTi, we have proposed the use of patient-specific, stiffness-matched fixation hardware, for mandible skeletal reconstructive surgery. Currently, Ti-6Al-4V is the most commonly used material for skeletal fixation devices. Although this material offers more than sufficient strength for immobilization during the bone healing process, the high stiffness of Ti-6Al-4V implants can cause stress shielding. In this paper, we present a study of mandibular reconstruction that uses a dry cadaver mandible to validate our geometric and biomechanical design and fabrication (i.e., 3D printing) of NiTi skeletal fixation hardware. Based on the reference-dried mandible, we have developed a Finite Element model to evaluate the performance of the proposed fixation. Our results show a closer-to-normal stress distribution and an enhanced contact pressure at the bone graft interface than would be in the case with Ti-6Al-4V off-the-shelf fixation hardware.

{"title": "Longitudinal Stretching for Maturation of Vascular Tissues Using Magnetic Forces.", "abstract": "Cellular spheroids were studied to determine their use as \"bioinks\" in the biofabrication of tissue engineered constructs. Specifically, magnetic forces were used to mediate the cyclic longitudinal stretching of tissues composed of Janus magnetic cellular spheroids (JMCSs), as part of a post-processing method for enhancing the deposition and mechanical properties of an extracellular matrix (ECM). The purpose was to accelerate the conventional tissue maturation process via novel post-processing techniques that accelerate the functional, structural, and mechanical mimicking of native tissues. The results of a forty-day study of JMCSs indicated an expression of collagen I, collagen IV, elastin, and fibronectin, which are important vascular ECM proteins. Most notably, the subsequent exposure of fused tissue sheets composed of JMCSs to magnetic forces did not hinder the production of these key proteins. Quantitative results demonstrate that cyclic longitudinal stretching of the tissue sheets mediated by these magnetic forces increased the Young's modulus and induced collagen fiber alignment over a seven day period, when compared to statically conditioned controls. Specifically, the elastin and collagen content of these dynamically-conditioned sheets were 35- and three-fold greater, respectively, at seven days compared to the statically-conditioned controls at three days.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Bioprinting and Its Potential in the Field of Articular Cartilage Regeneration.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques can be used for the fabrication of personalized, regenerative constructs for tissue repair. The current article provides insight into the potential and opportunities of 3D bioprinting for the fabrication of cartilage regenerative constructs. Although 3D printing is already used in the orthopedic clinic, the shift toward 3D bioprinting has not yet occurred. We believe that this shift will provide an important step forward in the field of cartilage regeneration. Three-dimensional bioprinting techniques allow incorporation of cells and biological cues during the manufacturing process, to generate biologically active implants. The outer shape of the construct can be personalized based on clinical images of the patient's defect. Additionally, by printing with multiple bio-inks, osteochondral or zonally organized constructs can be generated. Relevant mechanical properties can be obtained by hybrid printing with thermoplastic polymers and hydrogels, as well as by the incorporation of electrospun meshes in hydrogels. Finally, bioprinting techniques contribute to the automation of the implant production process, reducing the infection risk. To prompt the shift from nonliving implants toward living 3D bioprinted cartilage constructs in the clinic, some challenges need to be addressed. The bio-inks and required cartilage construct architecture need to be further optimized. The bio-ink and printing process need to meet the sterility requirements for implantation. Finally, standards are essential to ensure a reproducible quality of the 3D printed constructs.

{"title": "3D Printed Stem-Cell-Laden, Microchanneled Hydrogel Patch for the Enhanced Release of Cell-Secreting Factors and Treatment of Myocardial Infarctions.", "abstract": "Over the past several years, biomaterials loaded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have increasingly been used to reduce the myocardial fate of postinfarction collagen deposition and scar tissue formation. Despite successful gains, therapeutic efficacy has remained limited because of restricted transport of cell-secreting factors at the site of implantation. We hypothesized that an MSC-laden hydrogel patch with multiple microchannels would retain transplanted cells on target tissue and support transport of cell-secreting factors into tissue. By doing so, the gel patch will improve the therapeutic potential of the cells and minimize the degradation of myocardial tissue postinfarction. To examine this hypothesis, a stereolithographic apparatus (SLA) was used to introduce microchannels of controlled diameters (e.g., 500 and 1000 \u03bcm) during in situ cross-linking reaction of poly(ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate solution suspended with cells. Placement of the MSC-laden, microchanneled gel patch on the occluded left coronary artery in a murine model showed significant improvement in the ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and stroke volume, compared with gel patches without MSCs and MSC-laden gel patches without microchannels. In particular, the microchannels significantly reduced the number of cells required to recover cardiac function, while minimizing cardiac remodeling. In sum, the microchanneled gel patch would provide a means to prevent abnormal fibrosis resulting from acute ischemic injury.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-09-11", "authors": ["Molly RMelhem", "JooyeonPark", "LukeKnapp", "LarissaReinkensmeyer", "CarolineCvetkovic", "JordanFlewellyn", "Min KyungLee", "Tor WolfJensen", "RashidBashir", "HyunjoonKong", "Lawrence BSchook"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00176"}

{"title": "Inkjet Bioprinting of 3D Silk Fibroin Cellular Constructs Using Sacrificial Alginate.", "abstract": "Silk fibroin is a natural protein which has shown great promise for tissue engineering but is not printable due to slow gelation or harsh gelation conditions which are not cell-friendly. In this study, a two-step gelation process is proposed for the printing of silk fibroin, which utilizes alginate as a sacrificial hydrogel during an inkjetting-based process. A cell-laden blend of alginate with silk fibroin is utilized to achieve rapid gelation by calcium alginate formation during printing; it is followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzed covalent cross-linking of the fibroin protein at tyrosine residues after printing. This two-step gelation process successfully enables 3D bioprinting of well-defined cell-laden silk fibroin constructs suitable for long-term culture. The constructs remain intact after calcium chelation to liquefy the alginate component, demonstrating the formation of silk fibroin hydrogel. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts proliferate and spread through the hydrogel after printing. Increasing metabolic activity is observed for 5 weeks after printing, and histology shows dense cell populations in cultured constructs. The proposed two-step gelation technique is expected to enable 3D silk fibroin printing for various applications.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-08-14", "authors": ["Ashley MCompaan", "KyleChristensen", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00432"}
{"title": "Direct Production of Human Cardiac Tissues by Pluripotent Stem Cell Encapsulation in Gelatin Methacryloyl.", "abstract": "Direct stem cell encapsulation and cardiac differentiation within supporting biomaterial scaffolds are critical for reproducible and scalable production of the functional human tissues needed in regenerative medicine and drug-testing applications. Producing cardiac tissues directly from pluripotent stem cells rather than assembling tissues using pre-differentiated cells can eliminate multiple cell-handling steps that otherwise limit the potential for process automation and production scale-up. Here we asked whether our process for forming 3D developing human engineered cardiac tissues using poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogels can be extended to widely used and printable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. We demonstrate that low-density GelMA hydrogels can be formed rapidly using visible light (<1 min) and successfully employed to encapsulate human induced pluripotent stem cells while maintaining high cell viability. Resulting constructs had an initial stiffness of approximately 220 Pa, supported tissue growth and dynamic remodeling, and facilitated high-efficiency cardiac differentiation (>70%) to produce spontaneously contracting GelMA human engineered cardiac tissues (GEhECTs). GEhECTs initiated spontaneous contractions on day 8 of differentiation, with synchronicity, frequency, and velocity of contraction increasing over time, and displayed developmentally appropriate temporal changes in cardiac gene expression. GEhECT-dissociated cardiomyocytes displayed well-defined and aligned sarcomeres spaced at 1.85 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcm and responded appropriately to drug treatments, including the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and antagonist propranolol, as well as to outside pacing up to 3.0 Hz. Overall results demonstrate that GelMA is a suitable biomaterial for the production of developing cardiac tissues and has the potential to be employed in scale-up production and bioprinting of GEhECTs.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-08-14", "authors": ["PetraKerscher", "Jennifer AKaczmarek", "Sara EHead", "Morgan EEllis", "Wen JSeeto", "JoonyulKim", "SubhrajitBhattacharya", "VishnuSuppiramaniam", "Elizabeth ALipke"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00226"}

The composition and structure of ECM are not only heterogeneous, but also tissue or cell specific. Recapitulating the unique cell or tissue niche, ECM-based products are promising to quickly integrate with host tissues and accelerate restoration of tissue function. A variety of natural ECM-based scaffolds and tissue constructs have been biomanufactured using different approaches. Native tissue derived ECM is typically grounded into powders that can be further processed into hybrid composites in the form of hydrogels, foams, nanofibers, and 3D-printed complex constructs. Cell-derived ECM follows different biomanufacturing methods. Usually, cells are seeded on a scaffold to deposit ECM resulting in ECM-ornamented materials. The employment of resolvable scaffolds and cell sheet engineering technique enables production of complex 3D constructs exclusively composed of ECM with/without cells. In order to enhance mechanical strength, in vivo stability, and biological performance of ECM-based products, cross-linking reagents or bioactive factors are often used for modification. The major focus of this article is to provide an overview of current biomanufacturing approaches that utilize either native tissue or cell-derived natural ECM in the field of cellular and tissue engineering.

Specific to this technology is the sintering of the metal powder prior to the melting process. The sintering process has disadvantages for post-processing. The post-processing of parts produced by SEBM typically involves the removal of semi-sintered powder through the use of a powder blasting system. Furthermore, the sintering of large areas before melting decreases productivity. Current investigations are aimed at improving the sintering process in order to achieve better productivity, geometric accuracy, and resolution. In this study, the focus lies on the modification of the sintering process. In order to investigate and improve the sintering process, highly porous titanium test specimens with various scan speeds were built. The aim of this study was to decrease build time with comparable mechanical properties of the components and to remove the residual powder more easily after a build.

{"title": "Additive Manufacturing of Patient-Customizable Scaffolds for Tubular Tissues Using the Melt-Drawing Method.", "abstract": "Polymeric fibrous scaffolds for guiding cell growth are designed to be potentially used for the tissue engineering (TE) of tubular organs including esophagi, blood vessels, tracheas, etc. Tubular scaffolds were fabricated via melt-drawing of highly elastic poly(l-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) (PLC) fibers layer-by-layer on a cylindrical mandrel. The diameter and length of the scaffolds are customizable via 3D printing of the mandrel. Thickness of the scaffolds was varied by changing the number of layers of the melt-drawing process. The morphology and tensile properties of the PLC fibers were investigated. The fibers were highly aligned with a uniform diameter. Their diameters and tensile properties were tunable by varying the melt-drawing speeds. These tailorable topographies and tensile properties show that the additive-based scaffold fabrication technique is customizable at the micro- and macro-scale for different tubular tissues. The merits of these scaffolds in TE were further shown by the finding that myoblast and fibroblast cells seeded onto the scaffolds in vitro showed appropriate cell proliferation and distribution. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiated to smooth muscle lineage on the microfibrous scaffolds in the absence of soluble induction factors, showing cellular shape modulation and scaffold elasticity may encourage the myogenic differentiation of stem cells.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["Yu JunTan", "XipengTan", "Wai YeeYeong", "Shu BengTor"], "doi": "10.3390/ma9110893\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70410-3\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2007.11.002\n10.1038/nrcardio.2013.77\n10.1089/ten.tec.2013.0485\n10.1166/jnn.2016.11604\n10.1007/s10856-015-5477-4\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.003\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1112411\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.07.061\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.12.015\n10.1038/srep26039\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1210483\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.05.035\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1097053\n10.1002/jor.23075\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1172301\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1139378\n10.1080/17452759.2014.979557\n10.1007/s10544-012-9666-3\n10.1021/la800253b\n10.1016/j.acra.2008.02.001\n10.1016/j.acra.2013.03.014\n10.1038/GIMO6\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2008.09.002\n10.1161/01.CIR.86.1.232\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.011\n10.1002/jbm.b.30729\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.009\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.11.036\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.02.059\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.12.033\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.08.009\n10.1002/mame.201500028\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.09.051\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.003\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2012.11.001\n10.1155/2015/434876\n10.1016/S1369-7021(11)70059-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.01.064\n10.1016/S0021-9290(03)00160-X\n10.1115/1.1554412\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.005\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.02.010\n10.1039/C5TB02077H\n10.1021/cr3000169\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.06.051\n10.1098/rsif.2007.1354\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00030-9\n10.1007/s10404-015-1676-z"}

One approach to tackle this issue is to combine different additive manufacturing techniques, e.g., hot-melt extruded thermoplastics together with bioplotted cell loaded hydrogels in a sequential plotting process. This method enables the fabrication of 3D constructs mechanically supported by the thermoplastic structure and biologically functionalised by the hydrogel phase. In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) blend (PCL-PEG) together with alginate dialdehyde gelatine hydrogel (ADA-GEL) loaded with stromal cell line (ST2) were investigated. PCL-PEG blends were evaluated concerning plotting properties to fabricate 3D scaffolds, namely miscibility, wetting behaviour and in terms of cell response. Scaffolds were characterised considering pore size, porosity, strut width, degradation behaviour and mechanical stability. Blends showed improved hydrophilicity and cell response with PEG blending increasing the degradation and decreasing the mechanical properties of the scaffolds. Hybrid constructs with PCL-PEG blend and ADA-GEL were fabricated. Cell viability, distribution, morphology and interaction of cells with the support structure were analysed. Increased degradation of the thermoplastic support structure and proliferation of the cells not only in the hydrogel, but also on the thermoplastic phase, indicates the potential of this novel material combination for biofabricating 3D tissue engineering scaffolds.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["TobiasZehnder", "TimFreund", "MerveDemir", "RainerDetsch", "Aldo RBoccaccini"], "doi": "10.3390/ma9110887\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.024\n10.1557/mrs.2013.209\n10.1002/adma.201302042\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.11.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.050\n10.3390/jfb2030119\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00303\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2011.07.001\n10.1038/ncomms7933\n10.1007/s10853-015-9382-5\n10.1002/jbm.a.34420\n10.1002/1097-4636(200105)55:2<203::AID-JBM1007>3.0.CO;2-7\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.05.003\n10.1007/s10529-014-1745-5\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0355\n10.1108/13552541111138414\n10.1108/RPJ-04-2012-0037\n10.1088/1758-5082/3/2/021001\n10.1088/1758-5082/3/3/034102\n10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0651\n10.1038/nbt.3413\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/8/085014\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0416\n10.1039/c3tb21509a\n10.1016/j.carres.2005.02.028\n10.1021/bp010070p\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/2/025001\n10.1016/j.jcis.2004.02.001\n10.1021/bm025689+\n10.1016/j.polymer.2004.08.036\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.01.036\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.12.010\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.04.002\n10.1016/j.procir.2013.01.022\n10.1089/ten.tec.2015.0307\n10.1002/jbm.a.30008\n10.1088/1748-6041/3/3/034108\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/4/045004\n10.1007/BF03219067\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.061\n10.1089/ten.tec.2015.0452\n10.1002/term.1682"}
{"title": "Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing of AZ31 Magnesium Alloy: Grain Refinement by Adjusting Pulse Frequency.", "abstract": "Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) offers a potential approach to fabricate large-scale magnesium alloy components with low cost and high efficiency, although this topic is yet to be reported in literature. In this study, WAAM is preliminarily applied to fabricate AZ31 magnesium. Fully dense AZ31 magnesium alloy components are successfully obtained. Meanwhile, to refine grains and obtain good mechanical properties, the effects of pulse frequency (1, 2, 5, 10, 100, and 500 Hz) on the macrostructure, microstructure and tensile properties are investigated. The results indicate that pulse frequency can result in the change of weld pool oscillations and cooling rate. This further leads to the change of the grain size, grain shape, as well as the tensile properties. Meanwhile, due to the resonance of the weld pool at 5 Hz and 10 Hz, the samples have poor geometry accuracy but contain finer equiaxed grains (21 \u03bcm) and exhibit higher ultimate tensile strength (260 MPa) and yield strength (102 MPa), which are similar to those of the forged AZ31 alloy. Moreover, the elongation of all samples is above 23%.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["JingGuo", "YongZhou", "ChangmengLiu", "QianruWu", "XianpingChen", "JipingLu"], "doi": "10.3390/ma9100823\n10.2320/matertrans.42.1160\n10.1016/S0921-5093(00)01351-4\n10.3390/ma7031573\n10.1038/srep13933\n10.1081/AMP-200060436\n10.3390/ma7042534\n10.1016/S1003-6326(11)60738-3\n10.1007/s11837-008-0150-8\n10.3390/ma7107118\n10.1016/j.msea.2014.05.092\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.05.074\n10.3390/ma9060470\n10.1007/s00170-011-3299-1\n10.1007/s11665-014-0958-z\n10.3390/ma7032104\n10.1016/j.matchar.2013.07.012\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.10.141\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.04.018\n10.1016/j.msea.2016.03.034\n10.1080/10426914.2015.1025963\n10.1016/j.matdes.2011.06.061\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.10.039\n10.1007/s11661-012-1444-6\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2012.02.002\n10.1007/s00170-015-7077-3\n10.1016/j.phpro.2010.08.087\n10.1016/j.addma.2015.06.001\n10.1007/s00170-015-7112-4\n10.3390/ma9080652\n10.1016/j.actamat.2015.03.035\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2004.01.058\n10.1081/AMP-120002801\n10.1007/s12666-014-0469-5\n10.1007/s12540-011-1022-2\n10.1016/S1003-6326(14)63409-9\n10.1016/j.msea.2013.08.032\n10.1179/mt.1978.5.1.190\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.04.067\n10.1016/j.matdes.2013.10.023"}

In order to control charge density and mechanical properties of hyaluronan-based hydrogels, we developed cross-linkers with a neutral or positively charged triazole core with different lengths of spacer arms and two terminal maleimide groups. These cross-linkers react with thiolated hyaluronan in a fast, stoichiometric thio-Michael addition. Introducing a positive charge on the core of the cross-linker enabled us to compare hydrogels with the same interconnectivity, but a different charge density. Positively charged cross-linkers form stiffer hydrogels relatively independent of the size of the cross-linker, whereas neutral cross-linkers only form stable hydrogels at small spacer lengths. These novel cross-linkers provide a platform to tune the hydrogel network charge and thus the mechanical properties of the network.

{"title": "3D Bioprinting Technologies for Hard Tissue and Organ Engineering.", "abstract": "Hard tissues and organs, including the bones, teeth and cartilage, are the most extensively exploited and rapidly developed areas in regenerative medicine field. One prominent character of hard tissues and organs is that their extracellular matrices mineralize to withstand weight and pressure. Over the last two decades, a wide variety of 3D printing technologies have been adapted to hard tissue and organ engineering. These 3D printing technologies have been defined as 3D bioprinting.

{"title": "Synthesis and Characterization of Types A and B Gelatin Methacryloyl for Bioink Applications.", "abstract": "Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) has been increasingly considered as an important bioink material due to its tailorable mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, and ability to be photopolymerized in situ as well as printability. GelMA can be classified into two types: type A GelMA (a product from acid treatment) and type B GelMA (a product from alkali treatment). In current literature, there is little research on the comparison of type A GelMA and type B GelMA in terms of synthesis, rheological properties, and printability for bioink applications. Here, we report the synthesis, rheological properties, and printability of types A and B GelMA. Types A and B GelMA samples with different degrees of substitution (DS) were prepared in a controllable manner by a time-lapse loading method of methacrylic anhydride (MAA) and different feed ratios of MAA to gelatin. Type B GelMA tended to have a slightly higher DS compared to type A GelMA, especially in a lower feed ratio of MAA to gelatin. All the type A and type B GelMA solutions with different DS exhibited shear thinning behaviours at 37 \u00b0C. However, only GelMA with a high DS had an easy-to-extrude feature at room temperature.

Instead of traditional casting techniques, this study focuses on developing NAB components using recently expanded wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM).

Additively-manufactured NAB components without post-processing are fully dense, and exhibit fine microstructure, as well as comparable mechanical properties, to as-cast NAB alloy.

{"title": "Mechanical Properties of Additively Manufactured Thick Honeycombs.", "abstract": "Honeycombs resemble the structure of a number of natural and biological materials such as cancellous bone, wood, and cork. Thick honeycomb could be also used for energy absorption applications. Moreover, studying the mechanical behavior of honeycombs under in-plane loading could help understanding the mechanical behavior of more complex 3D tessellated structures such as porous biomaterials. In this paper, we study the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs made using additive manufacturing techniques that allow for fabrication of honeycombs with arbitrary and precisely controlled thickness. Thick honeycombs with different wall thicknesses were produced from polylactic acid (PLA) using fused deposition modelling, i.e., an additive manufacturing technique. The samples were mechanically tested in-plane under compression to determine their mechanical properties. We also obtained exact analytical solutions for the stiffness matrix of thick hexagonal honeycombs using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The stiffness matrix was then used to derive analytical relationships that describe the elastic modulus, yield stress, and Poisson's ratio of thick honeycombs. Finite element models were also built for computational analysis of the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs under compression. The mechanical properties obtained using our analytical relationships were compared with experimental observations and computational results as well as with analytical solutions available in the literature. It was found that the analytical solutions presented here are in good agreement with experimental and computational results even for very thick honeycombs, whereas the analytical solutions available in the literature show a large deviation from experimental observation, computational results, and our analytical solutions.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["RezaHedayati", "MojtabaSadighi", "MohammadMohammadi Aghdam", "Amir AbbasZadpoor"], "doi": "10.3390/ma9080613\n10.1016/j.injury.2011.06.015\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2015.11.033\n10.1016/j.msec.2015.11.001\n10.1108/13552541011011703\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0032\n10.1002/jbm.a.31311\n10.1002/jbm.a.30645\n10.1002/bit.20939\n10.1098/rspa.1982.0087\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2006.07.010\n10.1016/S1359-6454(97)00453-9\n10.1016/0022-5096(94)90085-X\n10.1243/0309324001514152\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.09.021\n10.1016/S0020-7683(97)00062-0\n10.1016/S0020-7683(98)00324-2\n10.1016/S0734-743X(02)00056-8\n10.2514/3.15148\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.05.008\n10.1016/0010-4361(79)90021-1\n10.1016/S0263-8223(96)00054-2\n10.1177/0731684405060567\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2007.07.009\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2015.11.017\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.046\n10.1016/j.matdes.2013.01.071\n10.1007/s10856-009-3763-8\n10.1002/adem.200800137\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.11.057\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.02.003\n10.3390/ma8041871\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.09.052\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.07.013\n10.1108/RPJ-08-2011-0086\n10.2961/jlmn.2009.02.0010"}

To guarantee accurate fabrication of the template for cervical vertebra operation, the contact face was placed upwards to improve the joint quality between the template and the cervical vertebra. The joint surface of the printed template had a roughness of Ra = 13 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm. After abrasive blasting, the surface roughness was Ra = 7 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm. The surgical metal template was bound with the 3D-printed Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic model. The micro-hardness values determined at the cross-sections of SLM-processed samples varied from HV0.3 250 to HV0.3 280, and the measured tensile strength was in the range of 450 MPa to 560 MPa, which showed that the template had requisite strength. Finally, the metal template was clinically used in the patient's surgical operation, and the screws were inserted precisely as the result of using the auxiliary template. The geometrical parameters of the template hole (e.g., diameter and wall thickness) were optimized, and measures were taken to optimize the key geometrical units (e.g., hole units) in metal 3D printing. Compared to the traditional technology of screw insertion, the use of the surgical metal template enabled the screws to be inserted more easily and accurately during spinal surgery. However, the design of the high-quality template should fully take into account the clinical demands of surgeons, as well as the advice of the designing engineers and operating technicians.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["DiWang", "YimengWang", "JianhuaWang", "ChanghuiSong", "YongqiangYang", "ZimianZhang", "HuiLin", "YongqiangZhen", "SuixiangLiao"], "doi": "10.3390/ma9070608\n10.1016/j.spinee.2013.03.029\n10.1007/s00402-011-1383-5\n10.3171/2008.11.SPI0817677\n10.3171/2008.9.SPI08229\n10.3109/10929080701662826\n10.1097/BRS.0000000000001179\n10.1371/journal.pone.0053580\n10.1097/00007632-200106150-00017\n10.3171/2014.3.SPINE13730\n10.1902/jop.2005.76.4.503\n10.1002/latj.201290018\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2012.11.011\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1106091\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1110868\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1026045\n10.1007/s00586-015-3908-z\n10.1016/j.joms.2016.01.030\n10.1016/j.jcms.2015.02.016\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.10.002\n10.1016/j.matlet.2014.11.156\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2015.01.025\n10.1007/s00170-016-8540-5\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2013.05.001"}

The results are discussed in terms of roughness, geometry of the fusion zone in the cross-section, microstructural modification, and microhardness so as to assess the effects of laser post processing.

{"title": "Comparison of Maraging Steel Micro- and Nanostructure Produced Conventionally and by Laser Additive Manufacturing.", "abstract": "Maraging steels are used to produce tools by Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods such as Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Although it is well established that dense parts can be produced by AM, the influence of the AM process on the microstructure-in particular the content of retained and reversed austenite as well as the nanostructure, especially the precipitate density and chemistry, are not yet explored. Here, we study these features using microhardness measurements, Optical Microscopy, Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) in the as-produced state and during ageing heat treatment. We find that due to microsegregation, retained austenite exists in the as-LMD- and as-SLM-produced states but not in the conventionally-produced material. The hardness in the as-LMD-produced state is higher than in the conventionally and SLM-produced materials, however, not in the uppermost layers. By APT, it is confirmed that this is due to early stages of precipitation induced by the cyclic re-heating upon further deposition-i.e., the intrinsic heat treatment associated with LMD. In the peak-aged state, which is reached after a similar time in all materials, the hardness of SLM- and LMD-produced material is slightly lower than in conventionally-produced material due to the presence of retained austenite and reversed austenite formed during ageing.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["Eric AJ\u00e4gle", "ZhendongSheng", "PhilippK\u00fcrnsteiner", "S\u00f6rnOcylok", "AndreasWeisheit", "DierkRaabe"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10010008\n10.1007/BF02646061\n10.1016/0956-716X(92)90276-K\n10.1016/S1359-6454(99)00370-5\n10.3139/146.101418\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.09.039\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.537-538.647\n10.1016/j.phpro.2011.03.033\n10.1108/RPJ-08-2014-0096\n10.1016/j.optlastec.2014.07.021\n10.3390/met6090218\n10.1016/S0924-0136(01)00625-2\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.08.084\n10.1016/j.actamat.2016.07.020\n10.1002/adem.200900061\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.02.062\n10.1016/j.msea.2005.03.074"}
{"title": "Costs, Benefits, and Adoption of Additive Manufacturing: A Supply Chain Perspective.", "abstract": "There are three primary aspects to the economics of additive manufacturing: measuring the value of goods produced, measuring the costs and benefits of using the technology, and estimating the adoption and diffusion of the technology. This paper provides an updated estimate of the value of goods produced. It then reviews the literature on additive manufacturing costs and identifies those instances in the literature where this technology is cost effective. The paper then goes on to propose an approach for examining and understanding the societal costs and benefits of this technology both from a monetary viewpoint and a resource consumption viewpoint. The final section discusses the trends in the adoption of additive manufacturing. Globally, there is an estimated $667 million in value added produced using additive manufacturing, which equates to 0.01 % of total global manufacturing value added. US value added is estimated as $241 million. Current research on additive manufacturing costs reveals that it is cost effective for manufacturing small batches with continued centralized production; however, with increased automation distributed production may become cost effective. Due to the complexities of measuring additive manufacturing costs and data limitations, current studies are limited in their scope. Many of the current studies examine the production of single parts and those that examine assemblies tend not to examine supply chain effects such as inventory and transportation costs along with decreased risk to supply disruption. The additive manufacturing system and the material costs constitute a significant portion of an additive manufactured product; however, these costs are declining over time. The current trends in costs and benefits have resulted in this technology representing 0.02 % of the relevant manufacturing industries in the US; however, as the costs of additive manufacturing systems decrease, this technology may become widely adopted and change the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer interactions. An examination in the adoption of additive manufacturing reveals that for this technology to exceed $4.4 billion in 2020, $16.0 billion in 2025, and $196.8 billion in 2035 it would need to deviate from its current trends of adoption.", "journal": "The International journal, advanced manufacturing technology", "date": "2017-07-28", "authors": ["DouglasThomas"], "doi": "10.1007/s00170-015-7973-6\n10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00512.x\n10.1108/17410381011063996\n10.1007/s00170-012-4558-5\n10.1016/j.jmsy.2012.07.004"}

{"title": "Nano-Welding of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Silicon and Silica Surface by Laser Irradiation.", "abstract": "In this study, a continuous fiber laser (1064 nm wavelength, 30 W/cm\u00b2) is used to irradiate multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on different substrate surfaces. Effects of substrates on nano-welding of MWCNTs are investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). For MWCNTs on silica, after 3 s irradiation, nanoscale welding with good quality can be achieved due to breaking C-C bonds and formation of new graphene layers. While welding junctions can be formed until 10 s for the MWCNTs on silicon, the difference of irradiation time to achieve welding is attributed to the difference of thermal conductivity for silica and silicon. As the irradiation time is prolonged up to 12.5 s, most of the MWCNTs are welded to a silicon substrate, which leads to their frameworks of tube walls on the silicon surface. This is because the accumulation of absorbed energy makes the temperature rise. Then chemical reactions among silicon, carbon and nitrogen occur. New chemical bonds of Si-N and Si-C achieve the welding between the MWCNTs and silicon.

CT scans of the fabricated 3D-printed boluses and paraffin boluses were acquired and superimposed onto patient CT scans to compare their fitting, bolus homogeneity, and underlying dose distribution. To quantify the level of matching, multiple metrics were utilized.

A typical coronary artery segment with bifurcations was emulated with a 3D printed static phantom and several angiograms were acquired at various angular positions on the C-Arm. The effectiveness of the reconstruction turned out to be largely influenced by the intrinsic parameters of the angiographic system, particularly the homogeneous coordinates system scaling factor \u03bb. Therefore, recourse was made to a heuristic optimization method to estimate the optimal value of \u03bb for each view. We measured the reliability of the reconstruction method by varying the fitness function of the optimization step and measuring the distances of 8 test points in comparison to the corresponding points identified in the \u03bcCT centerline. Preliminary results showed that, with an adequate number of views, the adoption of the optimal fitness function allowed the median distance error to be decreased below the acceptance threshold of 10%. As expected, the reliability of the method is improved by increasing the number of processed views.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Bioprinting the Cancer Microenvironment.", "abstract": "Cancer is intrinsically complex, comprising both heterogeneous cellular compositions and microenvironmental cues. During the various stages of cancer initiation, development, and metastasis, cell-cell interactions (involving vascular and immune cells besides cancerous cells) as well as cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions (e.g., alteration in stiffness and composition of the surrounding matrix) play major roles. Conventional cancer models both two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) present numerous limitations as they lack good vascularization and cannot mimic the complexity of tumors, thereby restricting their use as biomimetic models for applications such as drug screening and fundamental cancer biology studies. Bioprinting as an emerging biofabrication platform enables the creation of high-resolution 3D structures and has been extensively used in the past decade to model multiple organs and diseases. More recently, this versatile technique has further found its application in studying cancer genesis, growth, metastasis, and drug responses through creation of accurate models that recreate the complexity of the cancer microenvironment. In this review we will focus first on cancer biology and limitations with current cancer models. We then detail the current bioprinting strategies including the selection of bioinks for capturing the properties of the tumor matrices, after which we discuss bioprinting of vascular structures that are critical toward construction of complex 3D cancer organoids.

Individual HRTFs are usually obtained through intricate acoustic measurements. This paper investigates the use of a three-dimensional (3D) head model for acquisition of individual HRTFs. Two aspects were investigated; whether a 3D-printed model can replace measurements on a human listener and whether numerical simulations can replace acoustic measurements. For this purpose, HRTFs were acoustically measured for four human listeners and for a 3D printed head model of one of these listeners. Further, HRTFs were simulated by applying the finite element method to the 3D head model. The monaural spectral features and spectral distortions were very similar between re-measurements and between human and printed measurements, however larger deviations were observed between measurement and simulation.

{"title": "A low invasiveness patient's specific template for spine surgery.", "abstract": "Free-hand pedicle screw placement is still conventional in surgery, although it has potentially high risks. The surgical procedures such as pedicle screw placement are usually designed based on medical imaging, but during surgery, the procedures are not normally followed due to the fact that some points are missed in two-dimensional images and seen only during surgery. In this regards, some highly accurate computer-assisted systems have been proposed and are currently used. Moreover, it is possible to reduce or completely avoid hand working by applying modern digital technology. Therefore, using these technologies has remarkable advantages. In this study, we have presented a new approach of pedicle screw placement in the lumbar and sacral regions using a specific drill guide template. The template was created by additive manufacturing technology and was verified in a clinical study as well. The main aim of this research includes the following: design, analyze, manufacture and evaluate the accuracy of a new patient-specific drill guide template, for lumbar pedicle screw placement, and compare the template to the free-hand technique under fluoroscopy supervision. Our results show that the incidence of cortex perforation is substantially reduced compared to existing methods. Finally, we believe that this approach remarkably lowers the incidence of cortex perforation and could be potentially used in clinical applications, particularly in certain selected cases.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

{"title": "Influence of different grained powders and pellets made of Niobium and Ti-42Nb on human cell viability.", "abstract": "Nowadays, biomaterials can be used to maintain or replace several functions of the human body if necessary. Titanium and its alloys, i.e. Ti6Al4V are the most common materials (70 to 80%) used for structural orthopedic implants due to their unique combination of good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. Addition of \u03b2-stabilizers, e.g. niobium, can improve the mechanical properties of such titanium alloys further, simultaneously offering excellent biocompatibility. In this in vitro study, human osteoblasts and fibroblasts were cultured on different niobium specimens (Nb Amperit, Nb Ampertec), Nb sheets and Ti-42Nb (sintered and 3D-printed by selective laser melting, SLM) and compared with forged Ti6Al4V specimens. Furthermore, human osteoblasts were incubated with particulates of the Nb and Ti-42Nb specimens in three concentrations over four and seven days to imitate influence of wear debris. Thereby, the specimens with the roughest surfaces, i.e. Ti-42Nb and Nb Ampertec, revealed excellent and similar results for both cell types concerning cell viability and collagen synthesis superior to forged Ti6Al4V. Examinations with particulate debris disclosed a dose-dependent influence of all powders with Nb Ampertec showing the highest decrease of cell viability and collagen synthesis. Furthermore, interleukin synthesis was only slightly increased for all powders. In summary, Nb Ampertec (sintered Nb) and Ti-42Nb materials seem to be promising alternatives for medical applications compared to common materials like forged or melted Ti6Al4V.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Fluid and structure coupling analysis of the interaction between aqueous humor and iris.", "abstract": "Glaucoma is the primary cause of irreversible blindness worldwide associated with high intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated intraocular pressure will affect the normal aqueous humor outflow, resulting in deformation of iris. However, the deformation ability of iris is closely related to its material properties. Meanwhile, the passive deformation of the iris aggravates the pupillary block and angle closure. The nature of the interaction mechanism of iris deformation and aqueous humor fluid flow has not been fully understood and has been somewhat a controversial issue. The purpose here was to study the effect of IOP, localization, and temperature on the flow of the aqueous humor and the deformation of iris interacted by aqueous humor fluid flow.\nBased on mechanisms of aqueous physiology and fluid dynamics, 3D model of anterior chamber (AC) was constructed with the human anatomical parameters as a reference. A 3D idealized standard geometry of anterior segment of human eye was performed. Enlarge the size of the idealization geometry model 5 times to create a simulation device by using 3D printing technology. In this paper, particle image velocimetry technology is applied to measure the characteristic of fluid outflow in different inlet velocity based on the device. Numerically calculations were made by using ANSYS 14.0 Finite Element Analysis. Compare of the velocity distributions to confirm the validity of the model. The fluid structure interaction (FSI) analysis was carried out in the valid geometry model to study the aqueous flow and iris change.\nIn this paper, the validity of the model is verified through computation and comparison. The results indicated that changes of gravity direction of model significantly affected the fluid dynamics parameters and the temperature distribution in anterior chamber. Increased pressure and the vertical position increase the velocity of the aqueous humor fluid flow, with the value increased of 0.015 and 0.035\u00a0mm/s. The results act on the iris showed that, gravity direction from horizontal to vertical decrease the equivalent stress in the normal IOP model, while almost invariably in the high IOP model. With the increased of the iris elasticity modulus, the equivalent strain and the total deformation of iris is decreased. The maximal value of equivalent strain of iris in high IOP model is higher than that of in normal IOP model. The maximum deformation of iris is lower in the high IOP model than in the normal IOP model.\nThe valid model of idealization geometry of human eye could be helpful to study the relationship between localization, iris deformation and IOP.

These objects are being used across a variety of surgical specialties. The shortage of cadaver specimens is a major problem in medical education. However, this concern has been solved with the emergence of 3DP model. Custom-made items can be produced by using 3DP technology. This innovation allows 3DP use in preoperative planning and surgical training. Learning is difficult among medical students because of the complex anatomical structures of the liver. Thus, 3D visualization is a useful tool in anatomy teaching and hepatic surgical training. However, conventional models do not capture haptic qualities. 3DP can produce highly accurate and complex physical models. Many types of human or animal differentiated cells can be printed successfully with the development of 3D bio-printing technology.

Spinal fusion remains a common intervention for a range of spinal pathologies including degenerative disc and facet disease when conservative methods are unsuccessful. However, fusion devices are not always entirely efficacious in providing the desired fixation, and surgeons rely on 'off the shelf' implants which may not provide an anatomical fit to address the particular pathology. 3DP refers to a process where three-dimensional objects are created through successive layering of material, so called 'additive manufacturing'. Although this technology enables accurate fabrication of patient-specific orthopaedic and spinal implants, literature on its utilization in this regard is rare.

{"title": "Controlling the 3D architecture of Self-Lifting Auto-generated Tissue Equivalents (SLATEs) for optimized corneal graft composition and stability.", "abstract": "Ideally, biomaterials designed to play specific physical and physiological roles in\u00a0vivo should comprise components and microarchitectures analogous to those of the native tissues they intend to replace. For that, implantable biomaterials need to be carefully designed to have the correct structural and compositional properties, which consequently impart their bio-function. In this study, we showed that the control of such properties can be defined from the bottom-up, using smart surface templates to modulate the structure, composition, and bio-mechanics of human transplantable tissues. Using multi-functional peptide amphiphile-coated surfaces with different anisotropies, we were able to control the phenotype of corneal stromal cells and instruct them to fabricate self-lifting tissues that closely emulated the native stromal lamellae of the human cornea. The type and arrangement of the extracellular matrix comprising these corneal stromal Self-Lifting Analogous Tissue Equivalents (SLATEs) were then evaluated in detail, and was shown to correlate with tissue function. Specifically, SLATEs comprising aligned collagen fibrils were shown to be significantly thicker, denser, and more resistant to proteolytic degradation compared to SLATEs formed with randomly-oriented constituents. In addition, SLATEs were highly transparent while providing increased absorption to near-UV radiation. Importantly, corneal stromal SLATEs were capable of constituting tissues with a higher-order complexity, either by creating thicker tissues through stacking or by serving as substrate to support a fully-differentiated, stratified corneal epithelium. SLATEs were also deemed safe as implants in a rabbit corneal model, being capable of integrating with the surrounding host tissue without provoking inflammation, neo-vascularization, or any other signs of rejection after a 9-months follow-up. This work thus paves the way for the de novo bio-fabrication of easy-retrievable, scaffold-free human tissues with controlled structural, compositional, and functional properties to replace corneal, as well as other, tissues.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2017-01-17", "authors": ["Ricardo MGouveia", "ElenaGonz\u00e1lez-Andrades", "Juan CCardona", "CarmenGonz\u00e1lez-Gallardo", "Ana MIonescu", "IngridGarzon", "MiguelAlaminos", "MiguelGonz\u00e1lez-Andrades", "Che JConnon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.12.023"}
{"title": "Surgical applications of three-dimensional printing: a review of the current literature & how to get started.", "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) printing involves a number of additive manufacturing techniques that are used to build structures from the ground up. This technology has been adapted to a wide range of surgical applications at an impressive rate. It has been used to print patient-specific anatomic models, implants, prosthetics, external fixators, splints, surgical instrumentation, and surgical cutting guides. The profound utility of this technology in surgery explains the exponential growth. It is important to learn how 3D printing has been used in surgery and how to potentially apply this technology. PubMed was searched for studies that addressed the clinical application of 3D printing in all surgical fields, yielding 442 results. Data was manually extracted from the 168 included studies. We found an exponential increase in studies addressing surgical applications for 3D printing since 2011, with the largest growth in craniofacial, oromaxillofacial, and cardiothoracic specialties. The pertinent considerations for getting started with 3D printing were identified and are discussed, including, software, printing techniques, printing materials, sterilization of printing materials, and cost and time requirements. Also, the diverse and increasing applications of 3D printing were recorded and are discussed. There is large array of potential applications for 3D printing. Decreasing cost and increasing ease of use are making this technology more available. Incorporating 3D printing into a surgical practice can be a rewarding process that yields impressive results.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2017-01-17", "authors": ["DonHoang", "DavidPerrault", "MilanStevanovic", "AlidadGhiassi"], "doi": "10.21037/atm.2016.12.18\n10.1259/0007-1285-53-627-261-b\n10.3348/kjr.2016.17.2.182\n10.1016/j.jss.2015.06.051\n10.1007/s11548-008-0275-9\n10.1016/j.gie.2014.09.011\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2014-306189\n10.1002/lt.24019\n10.5858/arpa.2014-0408-OA\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.12.075\n10.1177/2048004016645467\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2014.06.009\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.12.059\n10.1016/S0895-6111(99)00025-7\n10.1097/TA.0000000000000481\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001539\n10.1111/cts.12315\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3010825\n10.3171/2015.10.PEDS15489\n10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.020\n10.1016/j.surg.2015.12.017\n10.1016/j.cjtee.2015.09.009\n10.1007/s00776-015-0706-8\n10.1097/BRS.0000000000000772\n10.12659/MSM.895597\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.01.003\n10.3171/2015.12.JNS151936\n10.1097/MD.0000000000000582\n10.1007/s00268-015-3218-y\n10.1016/j.jvs.2015.02.016\n10.1024/0301-1526/a000148\n10.1177/2150135115610285\n10.1017/S1047951114000742\n10.1007/s10278-016-9879-8\n10.1177/2150135116645604\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.12.030\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.015842\n10.3349/ymj.2015.56.6.1735\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.03.055\n10.1016/j.echo.2014.12.016\n10.5761/atcs.nm.13-00342\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.02.011\n10.1093/icvts/ivu174\n10.5761/atcs.cr.13-00189\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.03.115\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.12.033\n10.1007/s00268-014-2740-7\n10.1002/lt.23729\n10.3941/jrcr.v6i1.889\n10.4103/0366-6999.151088\n10.1016/j.eats.2015.03.003\n10.1016/j.urology.2015.11.043\n10.1007/s00345-015-1530-7\n10.1007/s00345-015-1632-2\n10.1007/s10006-014-0466-1\n10.1016/j.prosdent.2013.07.028\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001903\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001768\n10.1055/s-0035-1549006\n10.1002/micr.22293\n10.1055/s-0035-1546419\n10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2016.02.093\n10.1093/icvts/ivv320\n10.1002/ccd.25810\n10.1089/lap.2014.0370\n10.5761/atcs.nm.13-00322\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.09.031\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.10.021\n10.1089/lap.2014.0364\n10.1007/s00383-015-3709-9\n10.1111/ajt.13148\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.12.045\n10.1016/j.injury.2016.02.026\n10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.03.004\n10.1177/0003489415570937\n10.1177/0003489415598999\n10.1177/0194599816639586\n10.1016/j.wneu.2015.03.006\n10.1583/13-4450MR.1\n10.1177/1071100714544522\n10.1007/s00402-014-2075-8\n10.1186/s13018-015-0233-5\n10.1111/jopr.12487\n10.1016/j.jcms.2014.07.006\n10.1186/1746-160X-10-45\n10.1016/j.joms.2015.03.025\n10.1186/1475-925X-13-63\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2009.05.023\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2013.04.014\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.10.020\n10.1055/s-0034-1371080\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001456\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e3182a41bcc\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001953\n10.1017/S0022215110001799\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000001286\n10.1177/2150135114528721\n10.1016/j.wneu.2016.03.084\n10.1016/j.wneu.2015.12.102\n10.1016/j.wneu.2016.04.069\n10.1016/j.wneu.2013.10.032\n10.1016/j.wneu.2016.02.081\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.11.004\n10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.016\n10.1016/j.wneu.2015.03.058\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.03.001\n10.1016/j.gie.2015.03.1916\n10.1097/MAO.0000000000000848\n10.1017/S0022215115001346\n10.1097/MAO.0000000000000750\n10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3808\n10.1007/s00405-014-3300-3\n10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260542\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2014.10.001\n10.3109/01676830.2015.1049367\n10.1007/s00264-015-2943-z\n10.1016/j.injury.2015.01.020\n10.1097/BRS.0000000000001179\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.02.064\n10.3109/10929088.2015.1076039\n10.1007/s11999-015-4587-0\n10.1097/MD.0000000000002461\n10.1089/end.2015.0154\n10.1016/j.joms.2015.02.025\n10.1016/j.joms.2015.03.044\n10.1055/s-0035-1546814\n10.1016/j.jcms.2014.12.016\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000002012\n10.1177/0194599814552065\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2016-308399\n10.3928/1081597X-20160121-05\n10.3171/2015.3.FOCUS14852\n10.1016/j.gie.2015.01.062\n10.1038/srep23335\n10.3109/10929088.2014.885992\n10.1016/j.knee.2013.11.017\n10.1007/s13246-015-0330-0\n10.1089/end.2014.0280\n10.1016/j.joms.2015.03.026\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2014.04.010\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2014.01.023\n10.3109/10929088.2014.887778\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2013.03.007\n10.1016/j.joms.2015.06.169\n10.1016/j.joms.2014.12.033\n10.1016/j.ijom.2015.10.013\n10.1016/j.joms.2014.10.028\n10.1016/j.joms.2014.07.021\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001773\n10.1016/j.joms.2015.04.005\n10.1016/j.joms.2013.04.010\n10.1016/j.joms.2016.03.044\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001529\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000000973\n10.1016/j.jcms.2015.06.001\n10.1007/s00266-014-0424-1\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2014-306510\n10.1097/AOG.0000000000001237"}

Current simulation models, including cadaveric, animal, bench-top, virtual reality (VR) and robotic simulators are increasingly used in surgical training programs. Advances in telesurgery, three-dimensional (3D) printing, and the incorporation of patient-specific anatomy are paving the way for simulators to become integral components of medical training in the future. Evidence from the literature highlights the benefits of including simulations in surgical training; skills acquired through simulations translate into improvements in operating room performance. Moreover, simulations are rapidly incorporating new medical technologies and offer increasingly high-fidelity recreations of procedures. As a result, both novice and expert surgeons are able to benefit from their use.

{"title": "A Role for 3D Printing in Kidney-on-a-Chip Platforms.", "abstract": "The advancement of \"kidney-on-a-chip\" platforms - submillimeter-scale fluidic systems designed to recapitulate renal functions in vitro - directly impacts a wide range of biomedical fields, including drug screening, cell and tissue engineering, toxicity testing, and disease modelling. To fabricate kidney-on-a-chip technologies, researchers have primarily adapted traditional micromachining techniques that are rooted in the integrated circuit industry; hence the term, \"chip.\" A significant challenge, however, is that such methods are inherently monolithic, which limits one's ability to accurately recreate the geometric and architectural complexity of the kidney in vivo. Better reproduction of the anatomical complexity of the kidney will allow for more instructive modelling of physiological and pathophysiological events. Emerging additive manufacturing or \"three-dimensional (3D) printing\" techniques could provide a promising alternative to conventional methodologies. In this article, we discuss recent progress in the development of both kidney-on-a-chip platforms and state-of-the-art submillimeter-scale 3D printing methods, with a focus on biophysical and architectural capabilities. Lastly, we examine the potential for 3D printing-based approaches to extend the efficacy of kidney-on-a-chip systems.", "journal": "Current transplantation reports", "date": "2017-01-17", "authors": ["Ryan DSochol", "Navin RGupta", "Joseph VBonventre"], "doi": "10.1007/s40472-016-0085-x"}
{"title": "Three-Dimensional Bioprinting Nanotechnologies towards Clinical Application of Stem Cells and Their Secretome in Salivary Gland Regeneration.", "abstract": "Salivary gland (SG) functional damage and severe dry mouth (or xerostomia) are commonly observed in a wide range of medical conditions from autoimmune to metabolic disorders as well as after radiotherapy to treat specific head and neck cancers. No effective therapy has been developed to completely restore the SG functional damage on the long-term and reverse the poor quality of life of xerostomia patients. Cell- and secretome-based strategies are currently being tested in vitro and in vivo for the repair and/or regeneration of the damaged SG using (1) epithelial SG stem/progenitor cells from salispheres or explant cultures as well as (2) nonepithelial stem cell types and/or their bioactive secretome.

These bioprinting technologies will allow researchers to analyze the secretome components and extracellular matrix production, as well as their biofunctional effects in 3D mini-glands ex vivo.

{"title": "Transplantology: Challenges for Today.", "abstract": "Clinical transplantology in Poland had its 50th anniversary this year. With the early and long results comparable to the best achieved in the world leading centers, we face old and completely new challenges for this medical speciality. Main and growing challenge is insufficient number of available organs. With less than 15\u00a0donors/mln population/year Poland stay in the lower row of European countries in this measurement of transplant activity. Donation system is not efficient enough and we lose a big number of potential donors still. Living donation (with the exception for the fragments of the liver) remains low despite of different initiatives made so far on the national and local levels. Donation after cardiac death is possible from the point of Polish juridical regulations, but since last 3\u00a0years had not showed real impact on country donation rates (only three procedures done). Methods of tissue typing remain slow and cause relatively long times of cold ischemia for kidney programs. Second main challenge is chronic rejection causing loss of organs in the long-term follow-up and no efficient treatment employed. The emerging possibility of tolerance induction despite of plenty of new protocols proposition in the publications does not show up a clinical everyday practice in work. The same is with xenotransplantation promises; even we were informed recently that till 2030 such genetically modified porcine organs will be available. The next challenge is production of organs and tissues from own recipients cells installed on the different scaffolds or 3D printed. Other challenge is the personnel working in this field. We observe like in the other European countries lack of new candidates for work in this field together with serious problems of nursing staff, being a catastrophic perspective in country medical service in general, not only in transplant centers.

The purpose of this technical note is to describe design considerations for a protective glove and finger covering that maintains finger dexterity for children who exhibit finger and hand chewing (dermatophagia) and require therapeutic range of motion and may benefit from sensory stimulation resulting from constant contact between glove and skin. Protecting Little and Adolescent Youth (PLAY) Hands are protective gloves for children with developmental disorders such as CP who injure themselves by biting their hands due to pain or sensory issues. PLAY Hands will be cosmetically appealing gloves that provide therapeutic warmth, tactile sensory feedback, range of motion for donning/ doffing, and protection to maximize function and quality of life for families of children with developmental disorders. The technology is either a per-finger protective orthosis or an entire glove solution designed from durable 3D-printed biodegradable/bioabsorbable materials such as thermoplastics. PLAY Hands represent a series of protective hand wear interventions in the areas of self-mutilating behavior, kinematics, and sensation. They will be made available in a range of protective iterations from single- or multi-digit finger orthoses to a basic glove design to a more structurally robust and protective iteration.

While MRI is an extremely sensitive tool for detecting tissue abnormalities, association of signal changes with an underlying pathological process is usually not straightforward. In the central nervous system, for example, inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage, gliosis, and neuronal death may all induce similar findings on MRI. As such, interpretation of MRI scans depends on the context, and radiological-histopathological correlation is therefore of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, traditional pathological sectioning of brain tissue is often imprecise and inconsistent, thus complicating the comparison between histology sections and MRI. This article presents novel methodology for accurately sectioning primate brain tissues and thus allowing precise matching between histology and MRI. The detailed protocol described in this article will assist investigators in applying this method, which relies on the creation of 3D printed brain slicers.

In this study, the auxetic properties of a rotating squares auxetic design were utilized in tandem with a stretching mechanism to manufacture a device that offers the advantages of adjustable pore size and hence tunable drug delivery characteristics.\nAn auxetic polyurethane film was fabricated through the polymer casting technique. An acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastic mold for polymer casting was made through additive manufacturing. Stereolithography was used for fabrication of the mechanism that controlled pore size of the polymeric auxetic film. A laminate arrangement of the film and the mechanism was devised, through which movement of the mechanism controlled stretching of the auxetic film underneath.\nResults were analyzed through image processing. It was observed that a 2-dimensional increase (in length and width) of the auxetic film took place that corresponded to an increase in pore size of the film. Several mathematical correlations were drawn up.\nIt may be concluded that the first factor controlling drug release kinetics is the pore size of the film.

{"title": "A Novel Two-Compartment Model for Calculating Bone Volume Fractions and Bone Mineral Densities From Computed Tomography Images.", "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by a degradation of bone structures. Various methods have been developed to diagnose osteoporosis by measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of patients. However, BMDs from these methods were not equivalent and were incomparable. In addition, partial volume effect introduces errors in estimating bone volume from computed tomography (CT) images using image segmentation. In this study, a two-compartment model (TCM) was proposed to calculate bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and BMD from CT images. The TCM considers bones to be composed of two sub-materials. Various equivalent BV/TV and BMD can be calculated by applying corresponding sub-material pairs in the TCM. In contrast to image segmentation, the TCM prevented the influence of the partial volume effect by calculating the volume percentage of sub-material in each image voxel. Validations of the TCM were performed using bone-equivalent uniform phantoms, a 3D-printed trabecular-structural phantom, a temporal bone flap, and abdominal CT images. By using the TCM, the calculated BV/TVs of the uniform phantoms were within percent errors of \u00b12%; the percent errors of the structural volumes with various CT slice thickness were below 9%; the volume of the temporal bone flap was close to that from micro-CT images with a percent error of 4.1%. No significant difference (p >0.01) was found between the areal BMD of lumbar vertebrae calculated using the TCM and measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In conclusion, the proposed TCM could be applied to diagnose osteoporosis, while providing a basis for comparing various measurement methods.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "date": "2017-01-06", "authors": ["Hsin-HonLin", "Shin-LeiPeng", "JayWu", "Tian-YuShih", "Keh-ShihChuang", "Cheng-TingShih"], "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2016.2646698"}

For some, it is necessary to close a cardiac or extracardiac shunt using occluder (double disc system, plug, coil\u2026): closure of atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or patent arterial duct. For others, it is necessary to treat a valvular or vascular stenosis using a balloon catheter: dilatation of the pulmonary or the aortic valve, dilatation of aortic coarctation. For vascular stenosis, balloon angioplasty may be associated with stent implantation. Moreover, since more than 10 years, valve implantation can be performed: initially for pulmonic valve (the Melody\u2122 valve from Medtronic or the Sapien\u2122 valve from Edwards Lifesciences); but probably, most of the valves in the future could be implanted using appropriate tools and hybrid techniques combining cardiac catheterization and surgery. All these techniques were developed because of progress in fluoroscopy, and more recently association of different imaging techniques (echocardiography, MRI and CT) provides more information about the true anatomy. Interventional cardiac catheterization will continue to increase with use of new tools as 3D printing, tissue engineering and nano-techniques.

The deposited thin wall consisted of various morphologies, which includes epitaxial growth of prior \u03b2 grains, horizontal layer bands, martensite and basket weave microstructure, that depends on the heat input, multiple thermal cycles and gradual cooling rate in the deposition process. By gradually reducing heat input of each bead and using continuous current in the PAM process, the average yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation reach about 877MPa, 968MPa and 1.5%, respectively, which exceed the standard level of forging.

Development/optimization of inks for AM is complex, expensive, and substrate/interface dependent. This study investigates properties of free standing films of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer and an Ag\u207bcarbon black (Ag-CB) TPU PNC in a lightly loaded low strain compression contact as a rough measure of their suitability for AM. The TPU exhibited high hysteresis and a large viscoelastic response, and sufficient dwell time was needed for polymer chain relaxation and measurable adhesion. A new discovery is that large enough contact area is needed to allow longer time constant polymer ordering in the contact that led to higher adhesion and better performance/reliability. This has previously unknown implications for interface size relative to polymer chain length in AM design. The standard linear model was found to be a good fit for the viscoelastic behavior of the TPU. The PNC exhibited no adhesion (new result), low electrical resistance, and relatively small viscoelastic response. This implies potential for AM electrical trace as well as switch applications.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2016-12-29", "authors": ["Steven TPatton", "ChenggangChen", "JianjunHu", "LawrenceGrazulis", "Amanda MSchrand", "Ajit KRoy"], "doi": "10.3390/polym9010006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0042315\n10.1149/2.0061504jss\n10.1039/c3nr05496a\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2014.02.013\n10.1038/srep20814\n10.2174/1874183501104010019\n10.1371/journal.pone.0097484\n10.1108/RPJ-12-2011-0127\n10.1007/s11740-013-0504-0\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.879373\n10.1002/app.25462\n10.1021/la5023592\n10.1063/1.3253747\n10.1016/j.carbon.2015.11.051\n10.1051/epjconf/20159405005\n10.1116/1.1627336\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2004.08.001\n10.1088/0022-3727/42/3/035301\n10.1021/j100123a043\n10.12720/ijmse.2.1.1-5\n10.1051/jp4:1997359"}

To date, there has not been reported TM regeneration using bioprinted scaffold. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of bioprinted polycaprolactone/collagen/alginate-mesenchymal stem cell (PCAMSC) scaffolds for the regeneration of subacute TM perforation. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in an animal model of subacute TM perforation. In the experimental group (n=7), bioprinted 3D PCAMSC scaffold was placed on the perforation. The control group (n=7) were treated with polycaprolactone/collagen/alginate (PCA) scaffold. Healing time, acoustic-mechanical properties, and morphological analysis were performed by otoendoscopy, auditory brainstem response (ABR), single-point laser doppler vibrometer (LDV), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and light microscopic evaluation. The closure of the TM perforation was achieved in 100% of the experimental group vs. 72% of the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). The ABR threshold at all frequencies of the experimental group was recovered to the normal level compared to the control group. TM vibration velocity in the experimental group recovered similar to the normal control level. The difference are very small and they are not statistically significant below 1kHz (p=0.074). By OCT and light microscopic examination, regenerated TM of the experimental group showed thickened fibrous and mucosal layer. In contrast, the control group showed well regenerated but less thickened than experimental group. From these results, the cell-laden PCAMSC scaffold offers a significant advantage in the TM regeneration in a rat subacute TM perforation model.

{"title": "Evolution of design considerations in complex craniofacial reconstruction using patient-specific implants.", "abstract": "Previously published evidence has established major clinical benefits from using computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and additive manufacturing to produce patient-specific devices. These include cutting guides, drilling guides, positioning guides, and implants. However, custom devices produced using these methods are still not in routine use, particularly by the UK National Health Service. Oft-cited reasons for this slow uptake include the following: a higher up-front cost than conventionally fabricated devices, material-choice uncertainty, and a lack of long-term follow-up due to their relatively recent introduction. This article identifies a further gap in current knowledge - that of design rules, or key specification considerations for complex computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing/additive manufacturing devices. This research begins to address the gap by combining a detailed review of the literature with first-hand experience of interdisciplinary collaboration on five craniofacial patient case studies. In each patient case, bony lesions in the orbito-temporal region were segmented, excised, and reconstructed in the virtual environment. Three cases translated these digital plans into theatre via polymer surgical guides. Four cases utilised additive manufacturing to fabricate titanium implants. One implant was machined from polyether ether ketone. From the literature, articles with relevant abstracts were analysed to extract design considerations. In all, 19 frequently recurring design considerations were extracted from previous publications. Nine new design considerations were extracted from the case studies - on the basis of subjective clinical evaluation.

The development of tissue-engineered 3D models that mimic the endosteal microenvironment enables researchers to discover the causes and improve treatments for blood and immune-related diseases. The aim of this study was to establish a physiologically relevant in vitro model using 3D printed scaffolds to assess the contribution of human cells to the formation of a construct that mimics human endosteum. Melt electrospun written scaffolds were used to compare the suitability of primary human osteoblasts (hOBs) and placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (plMSCs) in (non-)osteogenic conditions and with different surface treatments. Using osteogenic conditions, hOBs secreted a dense ECM with enhanced deposition of endosteal proteins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, and osteogenic markers, such as osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase, compared to plMSCs. The expression patterns of these proteins were reproducibly identified in hOBs derived from three individual donors. Calcium phosphate-coated scaffolds induced the expression of osteocalcin by hOBs when maintained in osteogenic conditions. The tissue-engineered endosteal microenvironment supported the growth and migration of primary human haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) when compared to HSCs maintained using tissue culture plastic. This 3D testing platform represents an endosteal bone-like tissue and warrants future investigation for the maintenance and expansion of human HSCs.\nThis work is motivated by the recent interest in melt electrospinning writing, a 3D printing technique used to produce porous scaffolds for biomedical applications in regenerative medicine. Our team has been among the pioneers in building a new class of melt electrospinning devices for scaffold-based tissue engineering. These scaffolds allow structural support for various cell types to invade and deposit their own ECM, mimicking a characteristic 3D microenvironment for experimental studies.

{"title": "Applications of patient-specific 3D printing in medicine.", "abstract": "Already three decades ago, the potential of medical 3D printing (3DP) or rapid prototyping for improved patient treatment began to be recognized. Since then, more and more medical indications in different surgical disciplines have been improved by using this new technique. Numerous examples have demonstrated the enormous benefit of 3DP in the medical care of patients by, for example, planning complex surgical interventions preoperatively, reducing implantation steps and anesthesia times, and helping with intraoperative orientation. At the beginning of every individual 3D model, patient-specific data on the basis of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound data is generated, which is then digitalized and processed using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software. Finally, the resulting data sets are used to generate 3D-printed models or even implants. There are a variety of different application areas in the various medical fields, eg, drill or positioning templates, or surgical guides in maxillofacial surgery, or patient-specific implants in orthopedics.

{"title": "Materials and scaffolds in medical 3D printing and bioprinting in the context of bone regeneration.", "abstract": "The structural and functional repair of lost bone is still one of the biggest challenges in regenerative medicine. In many cases, autologous bone is used for the reconstruction of bone tissue; however, the availability of autologous material is limited, which always means additional stress to the patient. Due to this, more and more frequently various biocompatible materials are being used instead for bone augmentation. In this context, in order to ensure the structural function of the bone, scaffolds are implanted and fixed into the bone defect, depending on the medical indication. Nevertheless, for the surgeon, every individual clinical condition in which standardized scaffolds have to be aligned is challenging, and in many cases the alignment is not possible without limitations. Therefore, in the last decades, 3D printing (3DP) or additive manufacturing (AM) of scaffolds has become one of the most innovative approaches in surgery to individualize and improve the treatment of patients. Numerous biocompatible materials are available for 3DP, and various printing techniques can be applied, depending on the process conditions of these materials. Besides these conventional printing techniques, another promising approach in the context of medical AM is 3D bioprinting, a technique which makes it possible to print human cells embedded in special carrier substances to generate functional tissues. Even the direct printing into bone defects or lesions becomes possible. 3DP is already improving the treatment of patients, and has the potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine in future.", "journal": "International journal of computerized dentistry", "date": "2016-12-23", "authors": ["MartinHeller", "Heide-KatharinaBauer", "ElisabethGoetze", "MatthiasGielisch", "Ibrahim TOzbolat", "Kazim KMoncal", "EliasRizk", "HermannSeitz", "MichaelGelinsky", "Heinz CSchr\u00f6der", "Xiaohong HWang", "Werner E GM\u00fcller", "BilalAl-Nawas"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Investigation of foam flow in a 3D printed porous medium in the presence of oil.", "abstract": "Foams demonstrate great potential for displacing fluids in porous media which is applicable to a variety of subsurface operations such as the enhanced oil recovery and soil remediation. The application of foam in these processes is due to its unique ability to reduce gas mobility by increasing its effective viscosity and to divert gas to un-swept low permeability zones in porous media. The presence of oil in porous media is detrimental to the stability of foams which can influence its success as a displacing fluid. In the present work, we have conducted a systematic series of experiments using a well-characterised porous medium manufactured by 3D printing technique to evaluate the influence of oil on the dynamics of foam displacement under different boundary conditions. The effects of the type of oil, foam quality and foam flow rate were investigated. Our results reveal that generation of stable foam is delayed in the presence of light oil in the porous medium compared to heavy oil. Additionally, it was observed that the dynamics of oil entrapment was dictated by the stability of foam in the presence of oil. Furthermore, foams with high gas fraction appeared to be less stable in the presence of oil lowering its recovery efficiency. Pore-scale inspection of foam-oil dynamics during displacement revealed formation of a less stable front as the foam quality increased, leading to less oil recovery. This study extends the physical understanding of oil displacement by foam in porous media and provides new physical insights regarding the parameters influencing this process.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2016-12-22", "authors": ["KofiOsei-Bonsu", "PaulGrassia", "NimaShokri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2016.12.015"}

The wavelength-dependent photochemical behaviour in the LIFT method was verified and characterized by both theoretical and experimental studies compared to 1064\u2009nm fiber laser. The conductivity of the synthesized copper patterns could be enhanced using post electroless plating while retaining the designed pattern shapes. Prototypes of electronic circuits were accordingly built and demonstrated for powering up LEDs.

The system is versatile with respect to endpoints due to the translucence of the walls of the perifusion chambers, enabling optical methods for interrogating the tissue status. The system was validated by the incorporation of an oxygen detection system that enabled continuous measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR).\nStable and low flow rates (1-20 \u03bcL/min/channel) were finely controlled by a single pressure regulator (0.5-2 psi). Control of flow in 0.2 \u03bcL/min increments was achieved. Low flow rates allowed for changes in OCR in response to glucose to be well resolved with very small numbers of islets (1-10 islets/channel).

The items were evaluated via nonparametric statistics (1 [poor]-5 [good]).\nGroup 1 gave an average mark of 4.0 (\u00b10.9) versus 4.6 (\u00b10.6) by group 2. The haptics were rated as 3.6 (\u00b11.1) [1] and 4.2 (\u00b10.8) [2]. The surgical approach was graded 3.7 (\u00b11.2) [1] and 4.0 (\u00b11.0) [2]. Handling of the models was rated 3.5 (\u00b11.1) [1] and 4 (\u00b10.7) [2]. The insertion of the implants was marked as 3.7 (\u00b10.8) [1] and 4.2 (\u00b10.8) [2]. Fixation of the implants was also perceived to be realistic with 3.6 (\u00b10.9) [1] and 4.2 (\u00b10.45) [2]. Lastly, surgical navigation was rated 3.8 (\u00b10.8) [1] and 4.6 (\u00b10.56) [2].\nIn this project, all relevant hard and soft tissue characteristics of orbital anatomy could be realized. Moreover, it was possible to demonstrate that the entire workflow of an orbital procedure may be simulated. Hence, using this model training expenses may be reduced and patient security could be enhanced.", "journal": "Journal of surgical education", "date": "2016-12-18", "authors": ["Juergen ThomasLichtenstein", "Alexander NicolaiZeller", "JulianaLemound", "Thorsten EnnoLichtenstein", "MajeedRana", "Nils-ClaudiusGellrich", "Maximilian EberhardWagner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.07.005"}

{"title": "Current status of three-dimensional printing inks for soft tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies have become an attractive manufacturing process, which is called additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping. A 3D printing system can design and fabricate 3D shapes and geometries resulting in custom 3D scaffolds in tissue engineering. In tissue regeneration and replacement, 3D printing systems have been frequently used with various biomaterials such as natural and synthetic polymers. In tissue engineering, soft tissue regeneration is very difficult because soft tissue has the properties of high elasticity, flexibility and viscosity which act as an obstacle when creating a 3D structure by stacking layer after layer of biomaterials compared to hard tissue regeneration. To overcome these limitations, many studies are trying to fabricate constructs with a very similar native micro-environmental property for a complex biofunctional scaffold with suitable biological and mechanical parameters by optimizing the biomaterials, for example, control the concentration and diversification of materials.

{"title": "Making the cut: Innovative methods for optimizing perfusion-based migration assays.", "abstract": "Application of fluid shear stress to adherent cells dramatically influences their cytoskeletal makeup and differentially regulates their migratory phenotype. Because cytoskeletal rearrangements are necessary for cell motility and migration, preserving these adaptations under in vitro conditions and in the presence of fluid flow are physiologically essential. With this in mind, parallel plate flow chambers and microchannels are often used to conduct in vitro perfusion experiments. However, both of these systems currently lack capacity to accurately study cell migration in the same location where cells were perfused. The most common perfusion/migration assays involve cell perfusion followed by trypsinization which can compromise adaptive cytoskeletal geometry and lead to misleading phenotypic conclusions. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively highlight some limitations commonly found with currently used cell migration approaches and to introduce two new advances which use additive manufacturing (3D printing) or laser capture microdissection (LCM) technology. The residue-free 3D printed insert allows accurate cell seeding within defined areas, increases cell yield for downstream analyses, and more closely resembles the reported levels of fluid shear stress calculated with computational fluid dynamics as compared to other residue-free cell seeding techniques. The LCM approach uses an ultraviolet laser for \"touchless technology\" to rapidly and accurately introduce a custom-sized wound area in otherwise inaccessible perfusion microchannels. The wound area introduced by LCM elicits comparable migration characteristics compared to traditional pipette tip-induced injuries. When used in perfusion experiments, both of these newly characterized tools were effective in yielding similar results yet without the limitations of the traditional modalities. These innovative methods provide valuable tools for exploring mechanisms of clinically important aspects of cell migration fundamental to the pathogenesis of many flow-mediated disorders and are applicable to other perfusion-based models where migration is of central importance. \u00a9 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.", "journal": "Cytometry.

{"title": "Feasibility of Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy for in Vitro and in Vivo Monitoring Mineralization of Bone Tissue Engineering Scaffolds.", "abstract": "We investigated the feasibility of using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) for nondestructive characterization of bone tissue engineering scaffolds. The deep regions of these scaffolds, or scaffolds implanted subcutaneously in live animals, are typically difficult to measure by confocal Raman spectroscopy techniques because of the limited depth penetration of light caused by the high level of light scattering. Layered samples consisting of bioactive glass foams (IEIC16), three-dimensional (3D)-printed biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffolds (PLGA), and hydroxyapatite powder (HA) were used to mimic nondestructive detection of biomineralization for intact real-size 3D tissue engineering constructs. SORS spectra were measured with a new SORS instrument using a digital micromirror device (DMD) to allow software selection of the spatial offsets. The results show that HA can be reliably detected at depths of 0-2.3 mm, which corresponds to the maximum accessible spatial offset of the current instrument. The intensity ratio of Raman bands associated with the scaffolds and HA with the spatial offset depended on the depth at which HA was located.

Printable inks are the most important component for 3D printing, and are related to the materials, the printing method, and the structures of the final 3D-printed products. Carbon materials, due to their good chemical stability and versatile nanostructure, have been widely used in 3D printing for different applications. Good inks are mainly based on volatile solutions having carbon materials as fillers such as graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon blacks, and solvent, as well as polymers and other additives. Studies of carbon materials in 3D printing, especially GO-based materials, have been extensively reported for energy-related applications. In these circumstances, understanding the very recent developments of 3D-printed carbon materials and their extended applications to address energy-related challenges and bring new concepts for material designs are becoming urgent and important. Here, recent developments in 3D printing of emerging devices for energy-related applications are reviewed, including energy-storage applications, electronic circuits, and thermal-energy applications at high temperature.

Bernese PAO was performed. Using Mimics v10.1 software (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium), 3D computed tomographic reconstructions were created and the 4 standard PAO bone cuts-ischial, pubic, anterior, and posterior aspects of the ilium-as well as rotation of the dislocated acetabular bone blocks were simulated for each specimen. Using these data, custom 3D printed bone-drilling templates of the pelvis were manufactured, to guide surgical placement of the PAO bone cuts. An angle fix wedge was designed and printed, to help accurately achieve the predetermined rotation angle of the acetabular bone block. Each specimen underwent a conventional PAO. Preoperative, postsimulation, and postoperative lateral center-edge angles, acetabular indices, extrusion indices, and femoral head coverage were measured and compared; P and t values were calculated for above-mentioned measurements while comparing preoperative and postoperative data, and also in postsimulation and postoperative data comparison.All 10 PAO osteotomies were successfully completed using the 3D printed bone-drilling template and angle fix wedge. No osteotomy entered the hip joint and a single posterior column fracture was observed. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative measurements of the 10 sides showed statistically significant changes, whereas no statistically significant differences between postsimulation and postoperative values were noted, demonstrating the accuracy and utility of the 3D printed templates.The application of patient-specific 3D printed bone-drilling and rotation templates in PAO is feasible and may facilitate improved clinical outcomes, through the use of precise presurgical planning and reduced surgical complications with the precisely guided bone drilling.", "journal": "Medicine", "date": "2016-12-16", "authors": ["YouZhou", "XiaopengKang", "ChuanLi", "XiaoshanXu", "RongLi", "JunWang", "WeiLi", "HaotianLuo", "ShengLu"], "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000005557"}

A wide range of properties can be obtained by varying connectivity within the unit cell, which then can be further used to optimize structures specific to applications. A methodology for a systematic generation of microlattice structures is presented that focuses on controlling discrete topology instead of average porosity (as is done in conventional porous media). An algorithm is developed to create valid lattice structures without redundancies from a given set of template nodes. A set of possible permutations of structures from an eight-node cubic octant of a unit cell are generated for evaluation of the degree of anisotropy. Generic models are developed to calculate the effective thermal and mechanical properties as an effect of topology and porosity of the micro-architected structure. The thermal and mechanical anisotropies are investigated for the effective properties of micro-architected materials. A few of the structured materials are fabricated using 3D printing technology and their effective properties characterized. Structures are represented as graphs in the form of adjacency matrices. Effective thermal conductivity is analyzed using a resistance network model, and effective stiffness is evaluated using a self-consistent elastic model, respectively. A total of 160\u202f000 structures are generated and compared to porous-metal foams in which porosity is one of the design variables.

The aim of this study was to explore facilities for the semi-automated delineation of breast cancer tumors and to assess the feasibility of 3D printing of breast cancer tumors.\nIn a case series of five patients, different 3D imaging methods-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and 3D ultrasound-were used to capture 3D data for breast cancer tumors. The volumes of the breast tumors were calculated to assess the comparability of the breast tumor models, and the MRI information was used to render models on a commercially available 3D printer to materialize the tumors.\nThe tumor volumes calculated from the different 3D methods appeared to be comparable. Tumor models with volumes between 325\u2009mm\n3D printing (rapid prototyping) appears to be feasible. Scenarios for the clinical use of the technology might include presenting the model to the surgeon to provide a better understanding of the tumor's spatial characteristics in the breast, in order to improve decision-making in relation to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgical approaches.

They can, however, be difficult to manufacture, particularly if there is a lack of experience in superficial high-dose-rate brachytherapy techniques or with limited resources.\nWe present a novel method of manufacturing superficial brachytherapy applicators utilizing three-dimensional (3D)-printing techniques. We describe the treatment planning process and the process of applicator manufacture.\nThe treatment planning process, with the introduction of a pre-plan, allows for an \"ideal\" catheter arrangement within an applicator to be determined, exploiting varying catheter orientations, heights, and curvatures if required. The pre-plan arrangement is then 3D printed to the exact specifications of the pre-plan applicator design. This results in improved target volume coverage and improved sparing of organs at risk.\nUsing a pre-plan technique for ideal catheter placement followed by automated 3D-printed applicator manufacture has greatly improved the entire process of superficial high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment.

The critical-sized rat calvarial defect animal model was employed; further in vivo results indicated that both C3S and C3S/MBG30 scaffolds could induce new bone formation, but the C3S/MBG30 scaffolds significantly improved the osteogenic capacity compared to the pure C3S scaffolds.

{"title": "A technique for evaluating bone ingrowth into 3D printed, porous Ti6Al4V implants accurately using X-ray micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry.", "abstract": "This paper investigates the application of X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to accurately evaluate bone formation within 3D printed, porous Ti6Al4V implants manufactured using Electron Beam Melting (EBM), retrieved after six months of healing in sheep femur and tibia. All samples were scanned twice (i.e., before and after resin embedding), using fast, low-resolution scans (Skyscan 1172; Bruker micro-CT, Kontich, Belgium), and were analysed by 2D and 3D morphometry. The main questions posed were: (i) Can low resolution, fast scans provide morphometric data of bone formed inside (and around) metal implants with a complex, open-pore architecture?, (ii) Can micro-CT be used to accurately quantify both the bone area (BA) and bone-implant contact (BIC)?, (iii) What degree of error is introduced in the quantitative data by varying the threshold values?, and (iv) Does resin embedding influence the accuracy of the analysis? To validate the accuracy of micro-CT measurements, each data set was correlated with a corresponding centrally cut histological section. The results show that quantitative histomorphometry corresponds strongly with 3D measurements made by micro-CT, where a high correlation exists between the two techniques for bone area/volume measurements around and inside the porous network. On the contrary, the direct bone-implant contact is challenging to estimate accurately or reproducibly. Large errors may be introduced in micro-CT measurements when segmentation is performed without calibrating the data set against a corresponding histological section. Generally, the bone area measurement is strongly influenced by the lower threshold limit, while the upper threshold limit has little or no effect.

The aim of this study was to develop a \u03bcPIV approach to allow the extraction of velocity fields from a 3D additive manufacturing scaffold using a conventional 2D \u03bcPIV system. The \u03bc-computed tomography scaffold geometry was included in a CFD model where perfusion conditions were simulated.

Maximum velocities were found at the centre of the pore using both techniques with a difference of 12% which was expected according to the accuracy of the \u03bcPIV system. However, significant differences in terms of velocity magnitude were found near scaffold substrate due to scaffold brightness which affected the \u03bcPIV measurements.

This work aims to fabricate gastric-resistant 3D printed tablets using dual FDM 3D printing.\nThe gastric-resistant tablets were engineered by employing a range of shell-core designs using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and methacrylic acid co-polymer for core and shell structures respectively. Filaments for both core and shell were compounded using a twin-screw hot-melt extruder (HME). CAD software was utilized to design a capsule-shaped core with a complementary shell of increasing thicknesses (0.17, 0.35, 0.52, 0.70 or 0.87\u00a0mm). The physical form of the drug and its integrity following an FDM 3D printing were assessed using x-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), thermal analysis and HPLC.\nA shell thickness \u22650.52\u00a0mm was deemed necessary in order to achieve sufficient core protection in the acid medium. The technology proved viable for incorporating different drug candidates; theophylline, budesonide and diclofenac sodium. XRPD indicated the presence of theophylline crystals whilst budesonide and diclofenac sodium remained amorphous in the PVP matrix of the filaments and 3D printed tablets. Fabricated tablets demonstrated gastric resistant properties and a pH responsive drug release pattern in both phosphate and bicarbonate buffers.\nDespite its relatively limited resolution, FDM 3D printing proved to be a suitable platform for a single-process fabrication of delayed release tablets.

Hybrid scaffolds were readily printable at compositions of up to 70% bone by mass and displayed robust mechanical properties. Assessments of surface features revealed both collagenous and mineral components of bone were present. Qualitative and quantitative assessments showed increased surface roughness relative to that of pure PCL scaffolds.

We hypothesized that use of PCL and PLCL polymers with a spiral scaffold design could mimic the structure and mechanical properties of natural urethra of rabbits, and cell-laden fibrin hydrogel could give a better microenvironment for cell growth. With using an integrated bioprinting system, tubular scaffold was formed with the biomaterials; meanwhile, urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were delivered evenly into inner and outer layers of the scaffold separately within the cell-laden hydrogel.\nThe PCL/PLCL (50:50) spiral scaffold demonstrated mechanical properties equivalent to the native urethra in rabbit. Evaluation of the cell bioactivity in the bioprinted urethra revealed that UCs and SMCs maintained more than 80% viability even at 7days after printing. Both cell types also showed active proliferation and maintained the specific biomarkers in the cell-laden hydrogel.\nThese results provided a foundation for further studies in 3D bioprinting of urethral constructs that mimic the natural urethral tissue in mechanical properties and cell bioactivity, as well a possibility of using the bioprinted construct for in vivo study of urethral implantation in animal model.\nThe 3D bioprinting is a new technique to replace traditional tissue engineering.

{"title": "Strategy to Achieve Highly Porous/Biocompatible Macroscale Cell Blocks, Using a Collagen/Genipin-bioink and an Optimal 3D Printing Process.", "abstract": "Recently, a three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting process for obtaining a cell-laden structure has been widely applied because of its ability to fabricate biomimetic complex structures embedded with and without cells. To successfully obtain a cell-laden porous block, the cell-delivering vehicle, bioink, is one of the significant factors. Until now, various biocompatible hydrogels (synthetic and natural biopolymers) have been utilized in the cell-printing process, but a bioink satisfying both biocompatibility and print-ability requirements to achieve a porous structure with reasonable mechanical strength has not been issued. Here, we propose a printing strategy with optimal conditions including a safe cross-linking procedure for obtaining a 3D porous cell block composed of a biocompatible collagen-bioink and genipin, a cross-linking agent. To obtain the optimal processing conditions, we modified the 3D printing machine and selected an optimal cross-linking condition (\u223c1 mM and 1 h) of genipin solution. To show the feasibility of the process, 3D pore-interconnected cell-laden constructs were manufactured using osteoblast-like cells (MG63) and human adipose stem cells (hASCs).

{"title": "3D Printing of Hierarchical Silk Fibroin Structures.", "abstract": "Like many other natural materials, silk is hierarchically structured from the amino acid level up to the cocoon or spider web macroscopic structures. Despite being used industrially in a number of applications, hierarchically structured silk fibroin objects with a similar degree of architectural control as in natural structures have not been produced yet due to limitations in fabrication processes. In a combined top-down and bottom-up approach, we exploit the freedom in macroscopic design offered by 3D printing and the template-guided assembly of ink building blocks at the meso- and nanolevel to fabricate hierarchical silk porous materials with unprecedented structural control. Pores with tunable sizes in the range 40-350 \u03bcm are generated by adding sacrificial organic microparticles as templates to a silk fibroin-based ink. Commercially available wax particles or monodisperse polycaprolactone made by microfluidics can be used as microparticle templates. Since closed pores are generated after template removal, an ultrasonication treatment can optionally be used to achieve open porosity. Such pore templating particles can be further modified with nanoparticles to create a hierarchical template that results in porous structures with a defined nanotopography on the pore walls. The hierarchically porous silk structures obtained with this processing technique can potentially be utilized in various application fields from structural materials to thermal insulation to tissue engineering scaffolds.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-12-10", "authors": ["Marianne RSommer", "ManuelSchaffner", "DavideCarnelli", "Andr\u00e9 RStudart"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b11440"}

Preoperatively, the models demonstrated the extent of temporal lobe retraction necessary to visualize the proposed defects in the lateral skull base. Also preoperatively, Silastic sheeting was arranged across the modeled tegmen, marked, and cut to cover all of the proposed defect sites. The Silastic sheeting was then sterilized and subsequently served as a precise intraoperative template for a synthetic dural replacement graft. Of note, these grafts were customized without needing to retract the temporal lobe.\nFive patients underwent the middle cranial fossa approach assisted by 3D-printed temporal bone models to repair tegmen defects and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks. No complications were encountered. The prefabricated dural repair grafts were easily placed and fit precisely onto the middle fossa floor without any additional modifications.

{"title": "Development of a universal medical X-ray imaging phantom prototype.", "abstract": "Diagnostic X-ray imaging depends on the maintenance of image quality that allows for proper diagnosis of medical conditions. Maintenance of image quality requires quality assurance programs on the various X-ray modalities, which consist of pro-jection radiography (including mobile X-ray units), fluoroscopy, mammography, and computed tomography (CT) scanning. Currently a variety of modality-specific phantoms are used to perform quality assurance (QA) tests. These phantoms are not only expensive, but suitably trained personnel are needed to successfully use them and interpret the results. The question arose as to whether a single universal phantom could be designed and applied to all of the X-ray imaging modalities. A universal phantom would reduce initial procurement cost, possibly reduce the time spent on QA procedures and simplify training of staff on the single device. The aim of the study was to design and manufacture a prototype of a universal phantom, suitable for image quality assurance in general X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, and CT scanning. The universal phantom should be easy to use and would enable automatic data analysis, pass/fail reporting, and corrective action recommendation. In addition, a universal phantom would especially be of value in low-income countries where finances and human resources are limited. The design process included a thorough investigation of commercially available phantoms. Image quality parameters necessary for image quality assurance in the different X-ray imaging modalities were determined. Based on information obtained from the above-mentioned investigations, a prototype of a universal phantom was developed, keeping ease of use and reduced cost in mind. A variety of possible phantom housing and insert materials were investigated, considering physical properties, machinability, and cost. A three-dimensional computer model of the first phantom prototype was used to manufacture the prototype housing and inserts. Some of the inserts were 3D-printed, others were machined from different materials. The different components were assembled to form the first prototype of the universal X-ray imaging phantom. The resulting prototype of the universal phantom conformed to the aims of a single phantom for multiple imag-ing modalities, which would be easy to use and manufacture at a reduced cost.

To enhance cellular function in response to the implant surface, micro- and nano-scale topography have been suggested as essential. In this study, we present bone implants based on 3D-printed titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), with a unique dual topography composed of micron-sized spherical particles and vertically aligned titania nanotubes. The implants were prepared by combination of 3D-printing and anodization processes, which are scalable, simple and cost-effective. The osseointegration properties of fabricated implants, examined using human osteoblasts, showed enhanced adhesion of osteoblasts compared with titanium materials commonly used as orthopaedic implants. Gene expression studies at early (day 7) and late (day 21) stages of culture were consistent with the Ti substrates inducing an osteoblast phenotype conducive to effective osseointegration. These implants with the unique combination of micro- and nano-scale topography are proposed as the new generation of multi-functional bone implants, suitable for addressing many orthopaedic challenges, including implant rejection, poor osseointegration, inflammation, drug delivery and bone healing.

The objective of this study was to design a MCS replicating the pulmonary arterial circulation, incorporating an anatomically representative arterial model suitable for testing clinically relevant scenarios. A second objective of the study was to ensure the system's compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for additional measurements. A latex pulmonary arterial model with two generations of bifurcations was manufactured starting from a 3D-printed mold reconstructed from patient data. The model was incorporated into a MCS for in vitro hydrodynamic measurements. The setup was tested under physiological pulsatile flow conditions and results were evaluated using wave intensity analysis (WIA) to investigate waves traveling in the arterial system. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (IPVR) was simulated as an example of one pathological scenario. Flow split between right and left pulmonary artery was found to be realistic (54 and 46%, respectively). No substantial difference in pressure waveform was observed throughout the various generations of bifurcations. Based on WIA, three main waves were identified in the main pulmonary artery (MPA), that is, forward compression wave, backward compression wave, and forward expansion wave. For IPVR, a rise in mean pressure was recorded in the MPA, within the clinical range of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The feasibility of using the MCS in the MRI scanner was demonstrated with the MCS running 2 h consecutively while acquiring preliminary MRI data. This study shows the development and verification of a pulmonary MCS, including an anatomically correct, compliant latex phantom. The setup can be useful to explore a wide range of hemodynamic questions, including the development of patient- and pathology-specific models, considering the ease and low cost of producing rapid prototyping molds, and the versatility of the setup for invasive and noninvasive (i.e., MRI) measurements.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2016-12-08", "authors": ["Paul G MKnoops", "GiovanniBiglino", "Alun DHughes", "Kim HParker", "LinzhangXu", "SilviaSchievano", "RyoTorii"], "doi": "10.1111/aor.12809\n10.3389/fped.00107"}

For localized gating of SWNTs, it becomes critical to define SWNTs of controlled nanostructures and functionality onto desired locations in high precision. Here, we demonstrate that a biologically templated approach in combination of microfabrication processes can successfully produce a nanostructured channels of SWNTs for localized active devices such as local bottom-gated FETs. A large-scale nanostructured network, nanomesh, of SWNTs were assembled in solution using an M13 phage with strong binding affinity toward SWNTs and micrometer-scale nanomesh channels were defined using negative photolithography and plasma-etching processes. The bio-fabrication approach produced local bottom-gated FETs with remarkably controllable nanostructures and successfully enabled semiconducting behavior out of unsorted SWNTs.

Currently, the major impediment to clinical translation of our previously described platform for the fabrication of high fidelity, patient-specific tissue engineered ears is the development of a clinically optimal cell sourcing strategy. A limited autologous auricular chondrocyte (AuC) supply in conjunction with rapid chondrocyte de-differentiation during in vitro expansion currently makes clinical translation more challenging. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer significant promise due to their inherent chondrogenic potential, and large availability through minimally invasive procedures. Herein, we demonstrate the promise of AuC/MSC co-culture to fabricate elastic cartilage using 50% fewer AuC than standard approaches.\nBovine auricular chondrocytes (bAuC) and bovine MSC (bMSC) were encapsulated within 10 mg ml\nGross analysis of explanted discs revealed bAuC:bMSC co-culture discs maintained their size and shape, and exhibited native auricular cartilage-like elasticity after 1 and 3 months of implantation. Co-culture discs developed into auricular cartilage, with viable chondrocytes within lacunae, copious proteoglycan and elastic fiber deposition, and a distinct perichondrial layer. Biochemical analysis confirmed that co-culture discs deposited critical cartilage molecular components more readily than did both bAuC and bMSC discs after 1 and 3 months, and proteoglycan content significantly increased between 1 and 3 months.\nWe have successfully demonstrated an innovative cell sourcing strategy that facilitates our efforts to achieve clinical translation of our high fidelity, patient-specific ears for auricular reconstruction utilizing only half of the requisite auricular chondrocytes to fabricate mature elastic cartilage.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-12-06", "authors": ["Kerry AMorrison", "Benjamin PCohen", "OpeAsanbe", "XueDong", "AliceHarper", "Lawrence JBonassar", "Jason ASpector"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/9/1/015004"}

This has created a demand for the development of cell-based microarray chips for HTS of compounds. Although several cell-based microarray devices and procedures for screening of chemical libraries have been reported, each has limitations in terms of simplicity, speed, and cost. Here, we sought to make a simple method for producing multiple copies of microarray chips for the controlled release of small molecules during cell-based screening. Arrays of polytetrafluoroethylene microchannels were set in poly(dimethylsiloxane) and were formed in a metal mold. Subsequently, a biodegradable polymer, PLGAs, with chemical compounds was injected into each channel, and the array was sliced perpendicular to the channels to create multiple copies of the microarray chip. After seeding the cells on the microarray chip, we were able to successfully control the diffusion of small molecules and locally introduce the compounds into cells. The described method enables the production of multiple copies of the chip by using an easy, rapid, and inexpensive array fabrication without any specialized devices. Moreover, screening using the microarray chip minimizes the consumption of cells and chemicals. Both the biodegradable material and compound injected into each channel can be individually tuned for optimized performance.

This article reviews its contemporary applications in 3 aspects of surgery, namely, surgical planning, implants and prostheses, and education and training. Three-dimensional printing technology can contribute to surgical planning by depicting precise personalized anatomy and thus a potential improvement in surgical outcome. For implants and prosthesis, the technology might overcome the limitations of conventional methods such as visual discrepancy from the recipient's body and unmatching anatomy. In addition, 3D printing technology could be integrated into medical school curriculum, supplementing the conventional cadaver-based education and training in anatomy and surgery. Future potential applications of 3D printing in surgery, mainly in the areas of skin, nerve, and vascular graft preparation as well as ear reconstruction, are also discussed. Numerous trials and studies are still ongoing. However, scientists and clinicians are still encountering some limitations of the technology including high cost, long processing time, unsatisfactory mechanical properties, and suboptimal accuracy. These limitations might potentially hamper the applications of this technology in daily clinical practice.", "journal": "Surgical innovation", "date": "2016-12-04", "authors": ["ChiLi", "Tsz FungCheung", "Vei ChenFan", "Kin ManSin", "Chrisity Wai YanWong", "Gilberto Ka KitLeung"], "doi": "10.1177/1553350616681889"}

{"title": "Automated Robotic Dispensing Technique for Surface Guidance and Bioprinting of Cells.", "abstract": "This manuscript describes the introduction of cell guidance features followed by the direct delivery of cells to these features in a hydrogel bioink using an automated robotic dispensing system. The particular bioink was selected as it allows cells to sediment towards and sense the features. The dispensing system bioprints viable cells in hydrogel bioinks using a backpressure assisted print head. However, by replacing the print head with a sharpened stylus or scalpel, the dispensing system can also be employed to create topographical cues through surface etching. The stylus movement can be programmed in steps of 10 \u00b5m in the X, Y and Z directions. The patterned grooves were able to orientate mesenchymal stem cells, influencing them to adopt an elongated morphology in alignment with the grooves' direction. The patterning could be designed using plotting software in straight lines, concentric circles, and sinusoidal waves. In a subsequent procedure, fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells were suspended in a 2% gelatin bioink, for bioprinting in a backpressure driven extrusion printhead. The cell bearing bioink was then printed using the same programmed coordinates used for the etching. The bioprinted cells were able to sense and react to the etched features as demonstrated by their elongated orientation along the direction of the etched grooves.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2016-12-03", "authors": ["RamyaBhuthalingam", "Pei QLim", "Scott AIrvine", "Subbu SVenkatraman"], "doi": "10.3791/54604"}

The volumes were characterized in terms of texture features from gray-level co-occurrence and run-length matrices. Using a 3D clustered lumpy background (CLB) model, a fitting technique based on a genetic optimization algorithm was used to find CLB textures that were reflective of the liver textures, accounting for CT system factors of spatial blurring and noise. With the modeled background texture as a guide, four cylindrical phantoms (Textures A-C and uniform, 165 mm in diameter, and 30 mm height) were designed, each containing 20 low-contrast spherical signals (6 mm diameter at nominal contrast levels of \u223c3.2, 5.2, 7.2, 10, and 14 HU with four repeats per signal). The phantoms were voxelized and input into a commercial multimaterial 3D printer (Object Connex 350), with custom software for voxel-based printing (using principles of digital dithering). Images of the textured phantoms and a corresponding uniform phantom were acquired at six radiation dose levels (SOMATOM Flash, Siemens Healthcare) and observer model detection performance (detectability index of a multislice channelized Hotelling observer) was estimated for each condition (5 contrasts \u00d7 6 doses \u00d7 2 reconstructions \u00d7 4 backgrounds = 240 total conditions). A multivariate generalized regression analysis was performed (linear terms, no interactions, random error term, log link function) to assess whether dose, reconstruction algorithm, signal contrast, and background type have statistically significant effects on detectability. Also, fitted curves of detectability (averaged across contrast levels) as a function of dose were constructed for each reconstruction algorithm and background texture. FBP and SAFIRE were compared for each background type to determine the improvement in detectability at a given dose, and the reduced dose at which SAFIRE had equivalent performance compared to FBP at 100% dose.\nDetectability increased with increasing radiation dose (P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\nIn all background types, detectability was higher with SAFIRE compared to FBP.

Multicellular building blocks (bioinks) are dispensed layer by layer and scaled for the target construct. However, only a few materials are able to fulfill the considerable requirements for suitable bioink formulation, a critical component of efficient 3D bioprinting. Alginate, a naturally occurring polysaccharide, is clearly the most commonly employed material in current bioinks. Here, we discuss the benefits and disadvantages of the use of alginate in 3D bioprinting by summarizing the most recent studies that used alginate for printing vascular tissue, bone and cartilage. In addition, other breakthroughs in the use of alginate in bioprinting are discussed, including strategies to improve its structural and degradation characteristics.

Three-dimensional printing has been shown to be a powerful tool in surgical training. The objectives of this study were to explain the development of our 3-dimensional (3D) printed septoplasty training model, to assess its face and content validity, and to present evidence supporting its ability to distinguish between levels of surgical proficiency.\nImaging data of a patient with a nasal septal deviation was selected for printing. Printing materials reproducing the mechanical properties of human tissues were selected based on literature review and prototype testing. Eight expert rhinologists, 6 senior residents, and 6 junior residents performed endoscopic septoplasties on the model and completed a postsimulation survey. Performance metrics in quality (final product analysis), efficiency (time), and safety (eg, perforation length, nares damage) were recorded and analyzed in a study-blind manner.\nThe model was judged to be anatomically correct and the steps performed realistic, with scores of 4.05 \u00b1 0.82 and 4.2 \u00b1 1, respectively, on a 5-point Likert scale. Ninety-two percent of residents desired the simulator to be integrated into their teaching curriculum. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the expert, intermediate, and novice groups in time taken and nares cuts, whereas other performance metrics showed no significant difference.\nTo our knowledge, there are no other simulator training models for septoplasty. Our model incorporates 2 different materials mixed into the 3 relevant consistencies necessary to simulate septoplasty.

{"title": "On-site Rapid Diagnosis of Intracranial Hematoma using Portable Multi-slice Microwave Imaging System.", "abstract": "Rapid, on-the-spot diagnostic and monitoring systems are vital for the survival of patients with intracranial hematoma, as their conditions drastically deteriorate with time. To address the limited accessibility, high costs and static structure of currently used MRI and CT scanners, a portable non-invasive multi-slice microwave imaging system is presented for accurate 3D localization of hematoma inside human head. This diagnostic system provides fast data acquisition and imaging compared to the existing systems by means of a compact array of low-profile, unidirectional antennas with wideband operation. The 3D printed low-cost and portable system can be installed in an ambulance for rapid on-site diagnosis by paramedics. In this paper, the multi-slice head imaging system's operating principle is numerically analysed and experimentally validated on realistic head phantoms. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that the multi-slice head imaging system is able to generate better quality reconstructed images providing 70% higher average signal to clutter ratio, 25% enhanced maximum signal to clutter ratio and with around 60% hematoma target localization compared to the previous head imaging systems. Nevertheless, numerical and experimental results demonstrate that previous reported 2D imaging systems are vulnerable to localization error, which is overcome in the presented multi-slice 3D imaging system. The non-ionizing system, which uses safe levels of very low microwave power, is also tested on human subjects. Results of realistic phantom and subjects demonstrate the feasibility of the system in future preclinical trials.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-11-30", "authors": ["Ahmed ToahaMobashsher", "A MAbbosh"], "doi": "10.1038/srep37620\n10.1038/380509a0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0063223\n10.1038/srep21667\n10.1097/ACO.0b013e3283445898\n10.1002/047134608X.W8214\n10.1007/BF02442813\n10.2172/792437\n10.1109/APS.2008.4619683\n10.1155/2014/312528\n10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145267\n10.1109/RADAR.2011.5960677\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152351\n10.1109/CAMA.2015.7428123\n10.1109/BioCAS.2015.7348385\n10.4236/jemaa.2015.75017\n10.1155/2012/562563\n10.1109/TAP.2015.2398125"}

In this report, well-defined structures of polycaprolactone (PCL) and PCL- carbon nanotube (PCL-CNT) composite scaffolds have been designed and fabricated using a 3D printer. Conditions for 3D printing has been optimized while the effects of varying CNT percentages with PCL matrix on the thermal, mechanical and biological properties of the printed scaffolds are studied. Raman spectroscopy is used to characterise the functionalized CNTs and its interactions with PCL matrix. Mechanical properties of the composites are characterised using nanoindentation. Maximum peak load, elastic modulus and hardness increases with increasing CNT content. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies reveal the thermal and crystalline behaviour of PCL and its CNT composites. Biodegradation studies are performed in Pseudomonas Lipase enzymatic media, showing its specificity and effect on degradation rate. Cell imaging and viability studies of H9c2 cells from rat origin on the scaffolds are performed using fluorescence imaging and MTT assay, respectively.

We prospectively followed up 40 consecutive adult patients with closed TPF who underwent surgical treatment of reconstruction of the tibial plateau with the use of minimally invasive fixation. Sixteen patients (group 1) were operated using a pre-operative and intra-operative real size 3D-model, while 24 patients (group 2) were operated without 3D-model printing, but using only pre-operative and intra-operative 3D Tc-scan images. The mean operating time was 148.2\u00b115.9min for group 1 and 174.5\u00b122.2min for group 2 (p=0.041). In addition, the mean intraoperative blood loss was less in group 1 (520mL) than in group 2 (546mL) (p=0.534). After discharge, all patients were followed up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 1year and then every year post surgically and radiographic evaluation was carried out each time using clinical and radiological Rasmussen's score, with no significant differences between the two groups. Two patients (group 2) developed infection which resolved within 3 weeks after usage of antibiotics. Neither superficial nor deep infections were present in group 1. In all patients, no non-union occurred. No intraoperative, perioperative, or postoperative complications, such as loss of valgus correction, bone fractures, or metallic plate failures were detected at follow-up.

Cell culture studies with pre-osteoblasts indicated that the interconnected porous architecture of functionally gradient mesh arrays was conducive to osteoblast functions. However, there were statistically significant differences in the cellular response depending on the pore size in the functionally gradient structure. The interconnected porous architecture contributed to the distribution of cells from the large pore size (G1) to the small pore size (G3), with consequent synthesis of extracellular matrix and calcium precipitation. The gradient mesh structure significantly impacted cell adhesion and influenced the proliferation stage, such that there was high distribution of cells on struts of the gradient mesh structure. Actin and vinculin showed a significant difference in normalized expression level of protein per cell, which was absent in the case of fibronectin. Osteoblasts present on mesh struts formed a confluent sheet, bridging the pores through numerous cytoplasmic extensions.

{"title": "Flexible head-casts for high spatial precision MEG.", "abstract": "In combination with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data, accurate knowledge of the brain's structure and location provide a principled way of reconstructing neural activity with high temporal resolution. However, measuring the brain's location is compromised by head movement during scanning, and by fiducial-based co-registration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The uncertainty from these two factors introduces errors into the forward model and limit the spatial resolution of the data.\nWe present a method for stabilizing and reliably repositioning the head during scanning, and for co-registering MRI and MEG data with low error.\nUsing this new flexible and comfortable subject-specific head-cast prototype, we find within-session movements of <0.25mm and between-session repositioning errors around 1mm.\nThis method is an improvement over existing methods for stabilizing the head or correcting for location shifts on- or off-line, which still introduce approximately 5mm of uncertainty at best (Adjamian et al., 2004; Stolk et al., 2013; Whalen et al., 2008). Further, the head-cast design presented here is more comfortable, safer, and easier to use than the earlier 3D printed prototype, and give slightly lower co-registration errors (Troebinger et al., 2014b).\nWe provide an empirical example of how these head-casts impact on source level reproducibility.

All of the aforementioned limits of Tesla turbines can be addressed by scaling to the microfluidic flow regime. Demonstrated here is a microscale Tesla pump designed and fabricated using a Digital Light Processing (DLP) based 3D printer with 43 \u00b5m lateral and 30 \u00b5m thickness resolutions. The miniaturized pump is characterized by low Reynolds number of 1000 and a flow rate of up to 12.6 mL/min at 1200 rpm, unloaded.

In this regard, we have combined the attributes of a new alloy design and the concept of additive manufacturing to fabricate 3D scaffolds with an interconnected porous structure. The new alloy is a \u03b2-type Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn (Ti2448) alloy with significantly reduced modulus. In the present study, we explore the biological response of electron beam melted low modulus Ti2448 alloy porous mesh structure through the elucidation of bioactivity and osteoblast functions. The cellular activity was explored in terms of cell-to-cell communication involving proliferation, spreading, synthesis of extracellular and intracellular proteins, differentiation, and mineralization. The formation of fine apatite-like crystals on the surface during immersion test in simulated body fluid confirmed the bioactivity of the scaffold surface, which provided the favorable osteogenic microenvironment for cell-material interaction. The combination of unique surface chemistry and interconnected porous architecture provided the desired pathway for supply of nutrients and oxygen to cells and a favorable osteogenic micro-environment for incorporation (on-growth and in-growth) of osteoblasts.

{"title": "Inverted orientation improves decellularization of whole porcine hearts.", "abstract": "In structurally heterogeneous organs, such as heart, it is challenging to retain extracellular matrix integrity in the thinnest regions (eg, valves) during perfusion decellularization and completely remove cellular debris from thicker areas. The high inflow rates necessary to maintain physiologic pressure can distend or damage thin tissues, but lower pressures prolong the process and increase the likelihood of contamination. We examined two novel retrograde decellularization methods for porcine hearts: inverting the heart or venting the apex to decrease inflow rate. We measured flow dynamics through the aorta (Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA) at different Ao pressures and assessed the heart's appearance, turbidity of the outflow solutions, and coronary perfusion efficiency. We used rectangle image fitting of decellularized heart images to obtain a heart shape index. Using nonlinear optical microscopy, we determined the microstructure of collagen and elastin fibers of the aortic valve cusps. DNA, glycosaminoglycan, and residual detergent levels were compared. The inverted method was superior to the vented method, as shown by a higher coronary perfusion efficiency, more cell debris outflow, higher collagen and elastin content inside the aortic valve, lower DNA content, and better retention of the heart shape after decellularization. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use flow dynamics in a whole heart throughout the decellularization procedure to provide real-time information about the success of the process and the integrity of the vulnerable regions of the matrix. Heart orientation was important in optimizing decellularization efficiency and maintaining extracellular matrix integrity.\nThe use of decellularized tissue as a suitable scaffold for engineered tissue has emerged over the past decade as one of the most promising biofabrication platforms. The decellularization process removes all native cells, leaving the natural biopolymers, extracellular matrix materials and native architecture intact. This manuscript describes heart orientation as important in optimizing decellularization efficiency and maintaining extracellular matrix integrity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess flow dynamics in a whole heart throughout the decellularization procedure.

Pre-procedural case plans were generated from CT studies with recommended device size, catheter selection, and C-arm angle for deployment.\nAll 53 patients underwent successful LAA occlusion with the WATCHMAN. Three-dimensional CT LAA maximal-width sizing was 2.7 \u00b1 2.2 mm and 2.3 \u00b1 3.0 mm larger than 2-dimensional and 3D TEE measurements, respectively (p\u00a0\u2264 0.0001).

By 2-dimensional TEE maximal-width measurements alone, 62.3% (33 of 53) would have required larger devices. Using 3D TEE maximal-width measurements, 52.8% of cases (28\u00a0of\u00a053) would have required larger devices.

Traditional tissue engineering methods cannot create such intricate structures, nor can they precisely control cellular position or spatial distribution.

Bioprinting can be defined as the programmed deposition of cells or other biologics, often with accompanying biomaterials. In this concise review, we focus on recent advances in stem cell bioprinting, including performance, utility, and applications in regenerative medicine. More specifically, this review explores the capability of bioprinting to direct stem cell fate, engineer tissue(s), and create functional vascular networks. Furthermore, the unique challenges and concerns related to bioprinting living stem cells, such as viability and maintaining multi- or pluripotency, are discussed. The regenerative capacity of stem cells, when combined with the structural/compositional control afforded by bioprinting, provides a unique and powerful tool to address the complex demands of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2016-11-22", "authors": ["Brad JTricomi", "Andrew DDias", "David TCorr"], "doi": "10.1111/nyas.13266"}

{"title": "Rapid assembly of multilayer microfluidic structures via 3D-printed transfer molding and bonding.", "abstract": "A critical feature of state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies is the ability to fabricate multilayer structures without relying on the expensive equipment and facilities required by soft lithography-defined processes. Here, three-dimensional (3D) printed polymer molds are used to construct multilayer poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) devices by employing unique molding, bonding, alignment, and rapid assembly processes. Specifically, a novel single-layer, two-sided molding method is developed to realize two channel levels, non-planar membranes/valves, vertical interconnects (vias) between channel levels, and integrated inlet/outlet ports for fast linkages to external fluidic systems. As a demonstration, a single-layer membrane microvalve is constructed and tested by applying various gate pressures under parametric variation of source pressure, illustrating a high degree of flow rate control. In addition, multilayer structures are fabricated through an intralayer bonding procedure that uses custom 3D-printed stamps to selectively apply uncured liquid PDMS adhesive only to bonding interfaces without clogging fluidic channels. Using integrated alignment marks to accurately position both stamps and individual layers, this technique is demonstrated by rapidly assembling a six-layer microfluidic device. By combining the versatility of 3D printing while retaining the favorable mechanical and biological properties of PDMS, this work can potentially open up a new class of manufacturing techniques for multilayer microfluidic systems.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2016-11-21", "authors": ["Casey CGlick", "Mitchell TSrimongkol", "Aaron JSchwartz", "William SZhuang", "Joseph CLin", "Roseanne HWarren", "Dennis RTekell", "Panitan ASatamalee", "LiweiLin"], "doi": "10.1038/micronano.2016.63"}

Here, a filament extruder was used to obtain filaments of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing paracetamol or caffeine appropriate for 3D printing. The filaments were used to manufacture caplets for oral administration by FDM 3D printing, with the aim of evaluating the effect of the internal structure (micropore volume), drug loading and composition on drug dissolution behaviour. Micropore volume of the caplets was primarily determined by the presence of large pores due to gaps in the printed layers/net while printing, and the porosity of the caplets was 10 fold higher than the porosity of the extruded filament. Dynamic dissolution drug release tests on the caplets in biorelevant bicarbonate media revealed distinctive release profiles, which were dependent on drug solubility and drug loading. Porosity of the caplets did not help to predict the different drug release profiles.

The factors that determine capsular porosity are not well understood. Failed GDD surgeries are usually associated with thick impervious capsules and components of aqueous have been implicated in this process.\nIn this study, we interrogated the effect of passage of nonaqueous fluid on capsular porosity in mature (but aqueous na\u00efve) blebs in a previously reported GDD model (the \"Center for Eye Research Australia Implant\").\nThe study was performed at two centers using 17 New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. An experimental GDD was implanted into the subconjunctival space but without connection to the anterior chamber. After 28 days, balanced salt solution (BSS) was passed through the implant for 30 to 40 minutes at 12 mm Hg. Capsular porosity was measured as flow (\u03bcL/min) at a constant pressure. Porosity of the capsule was retested at 3 and 6 days.\nThere was a marked reduction in capsular porosity within 3 days of exposure to BSS (fluid challenge). Even though the baseline porosity was significantly different in the two groups (3.00 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcL/min and 29.67 \u00b1 12.12 \u03bcL/min, p < 0.001), the effect of passage of BSS was similar. Capsular porosity fell by approximately 80% in both groups from baseline after single BSS challenge. Capsular thickness was significantly less in Advanced Eye Center (AEC) rabbits at baseline. There was no change in the capsular thickness before and after single fluid challenge.\nPassage of BSS at physiological pressures for under 40 minutes caused marked reduction in the porosity of the fibrous capsule within 3 days. This was not associated with any significant thickening of the fibrous capsule within this time frame.\nPandav SS, Ross CM, Thattaruthody F, Nada R, Singh N, Gautam N, Beirne S, Wallace GG, Sherwood MB, Crowston JG, Coote M.

In this work, we integrated biological studies, computational calculations and physical experiments to understand this phenomenon. We present a 3D model of the upper respiratory system based on a detailed histological analysis. A 3D-printed version of this model was used in combination with characteristic ventilation patterns for computational calculations and fluid mechanics experiments. By calculating the velocity field, we identified a sharp decrease in velocity in the anterior part of the nasal cavity where mucus and cilia are present. The experiments with the 3D-printed model validate the calculations: particles, if present, were found only in the same area as suggested by the calculations.

The regeneration of the damaged intima layer after this treatment is still one of the major challenges in the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering. Different polymers have been used in scaffold manufacturing in order to improve tissue regeneration. Elastin-mimetic polymers are a new class of molecules that have been synthesized and used to obtain small diameter fibers with specific morphological characteristics. Elastin-like polymers produced by recombinant techniques and called elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) are particularly promising due to their high degree of functionalization. Generally speaking, ELRs can show more complex molecular designs and a tighter control of their sequence than other chemically synthetized polymers Rodriguez Cabello et al (2009 Polymer 50 5159-69, 2011\u00a0Nanomedicine 6 111-22). For the fabrication of small diameter fibers, different ELRs were dissolved in 2,2,2-fluoroethanol (TFE). Dynamic light scattering was used to identify the transition temperature and get a deep characterization of the transition behavior of the recombinamers. In this work, we describe the use of electrospinning technique for the manufacturing of an elastic fibrous scaffold; the obtained fibers were characterized and their cytocompatibility was tested in vitro. A thorough study of the influence of voltage, flow rate and distance was carried out in order to determine the appropriate parameters to obtain fibrous mats without beads and defects. Moreover, using a rotating mandrel, we fabricated a tubular scaffold in which ELRs containing different cell adhesion sequences (mainly REDV and RGD) were collected.

However, determining when this additional information proves instrumental in patient management remains a challenge. We describe our experience with patient-specific anatomic models created using rapid prototyping from various imaging modalities, suggesting their utility in surgical and interventional planning in congenital heart disease (CHD). Virtual and physical 3-dimensional (3D) models were generated from CT or MRI data, using commercially available software for patients with complex muscular ventricular septal defects (CMVSD) and double-outlet right ventricle (DORV). Six patients with complex anatomy and uncertainty of the optimal management strategy were included in this study. The models were subsequently used to guide management decisions, and the outcomes reviewed. 3D models clearly demonstrated the complex intra-cardiac anatomy in all six patients and were utilized to guide management decisions. In the three patients with CMVSD, one underwent successful endovascular device closure following a prior failed attempt at transcatheter closure, and the other two underwent successful primary surgical closure with the aid of 3D models. In all three cases of DORV, the models provided better anatomic delineation and additional information that altered or confirmed the surgical plan. Patient-specific 3D heart models show promise in accurately defining intra-cardiac anatomy in CHD, specifically CMVSD and DORV.

Also, spheroids have been recently introduced as building blocks in directed self-assembly strategy. Recent efforts aim to improve long-term cell retention and integration by the use of microencapsulation delivery systems that can rapidly integrate in the implantation site. Interlockable solid synthetic microscaffolds, so called lockyballs, were recently designed with hooks and loops to enhance cell retention and integration at the implantation site as well as to support spheroids aggregation after transplantation. Here we present an efficient methodology for human ASCs spheroids biofabrication and lockyballs cellularization using micro-molded non-adhesive agarose hydrogel. Lockyballs were produced using two-photon polymerization with an estimated mechanical strength. The Young's modulus was calculated at level 0.1362 +/-0.009 MPa. Interlocking in vitro test demonstrates high level of loading induced interlockability of fabricated lockyballs.

With the combination of soft ultra-violet nanoimprinting lithography and scrape technique, it offers parallel processing with high resolution (10000dpi), as well as remarkable simplicity and fully controllable flexibility to tailor the transmittance and sheet resistance. While being able to achieve maximum transmittance 60% in the on state and the minimum 0.1% in the off state, the PDLC smart window displays low sheet resistance (5.58 \u03a9/sq.) under low driven voltage (30V) safe for human. The main advantage of adoption of PDLC as an optically scattering element lies in the fact that there needs no mechanical part for in situ tunability. An enhancement factor of 50 of the diffraction intensity is observed experimentally. The embedded Ag mesh TCE for PDLC device has an environmentally-friendly additive manufacturing process inherently.

Using hydrogel as a bioink for cell printing provides a biological platform for basic research and potential medical treatments. In this study, a waterborne poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL)-based biodegradable polyurethane (PU) with a soft segment replaced with 20 mol% of poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) diol or poly (d,l-lactide) (PDLLA) diol was prepared. These two PUs formed compact packing structures at temperatures \u226537 \u00b0C. They responded differently to temperature changes and the presence of electrolytes because of the difference in the free volume. With their thermal-responsive properties, both PU dispersions could form a gel in 3 min with the gel modulus reaching about 6-8 kPa after 30 min. To enhance the structural integrity during layer-by-layer deposition, the hybrid hydrogel of PU and soy protein isolate (PU/SPI hybrid) was further developed. The PU/SPI hybrid dispersion could undergo rapid gelation at 37 \u00b0C with the modulus reaching 130 Pa in 1 min. Moreover, the PU/SPI hybrid gel was readily blended with cells and printed at 37 \u00b0C without preheating.

{"title": "Fluid Micro-Reservoirs Array Design with Auto-Pressure Regulation for High-Speed 3D Printers.", "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) printing technology is rapidly evolving such that printing speed is now a crucial factor in technological developments and future applications. For printing heads based on the inkjet concept, the number of nozzles on the print head is a limiting factor of printing speed. This paper offers a method to practically increase the number of nozzles unlimitedly, and thus to dramatically ramp up printing speed. Fluid reservoirs are used in inkjet print heads to supply fluid through a manifold to the jetting chambers. The pressure in the reservoir's outlet is important and influences device performance. Many efforts have been made to regulate pressure inside the fluid reservoirs so as to obtain a constant pressure in the chambers. When the number of nozzles is increased too much, the regulation of uniform pressure among all the nozzles becomes too complicated. In this paper, a different approach is taken. The reservoir is divided into an array of many micro-reservoirs. Each micro-reservoir supports one or a few chambers, and has a unique structure with auto-pressure regulation, where the outlet pressure is independent of the fluid level. The regulation is based on auto-compensation of the gravity force and a capillary force having the same dependence on the fluid level; this feature is obtained by adding a wedge in the reservoir with a unique shape. When the fluid level drops, the gravitational force and the capillary force decrease with it, but at similar rates. Terms for the force balance are derived and, consequently, a constant pressure in the fluid micro-reservoir segment is obtained automatically, with each segment being autonomous. This micro reservoir array is suggested for the enlargement of an inkjet print head and the achievement of high-speed 3D printing.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2016-11-07", "authors": ["MosheEinat"], "doi": "10.3390/mi7110202\n10.1109/LAWP.2012.2187269\n10.1122/1.4724331\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.878879\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.056\n10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2040946\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.505-507.415\n10.1063/1.2337107\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/5/055012"}

The aim of this study was to assess an in-house manufacturing approach to customized cutting guides for use in the reconstruction of the mandible with osteocutaneous free flaps. A retrospective cohort study was performed, involving 18 patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction with a fibula free flap at three institutions during the period July 2012 to March 2015. A single surgeon designed and manufactured fibula and mandible cutting guides using a computer-aided design process and three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. The oncological outcomes, production parameters, and quality of the reconstructions performed for each patient were recorded. Computed tomography scans were acquired after surgery, and these were compared with the preoperative 3D models. Eighteen consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma underwent surgery and then reconstruction using this customized in-house surgical approach. The lengths of the fibula bone segments and the angle measurements in the simulations were similar to those of the postoperative volume rendering (P=0.61).

The purpose of this study was to present a protocol for the design and 3D printing of final digital occlusal splints based on 3D planning of orthognathic surgery and to validate the accuracy of these splints.

The required data were then exported into 3-matic software (Materialise) to design the splints, which were 3D printed in biocompatible material using an Objet Connex 350 printer (Stratasys). To validate the accuracy of the splints, the cases of 20 patients undergoing orthognathic surgery were analysed. The splints were assessed clinically and quantitatively by comparing the printed splints to the conventional analogue set-up (clinical standard) and recording the absolute distance errors of three landmarks.

We developed a 3D digital model of a cancer of the head of the pancreas by integrating actual CT data with 3D modeling process. After this process, the virtual pancreatic model was also produced using a high-quality 3D printer.\nA 56-year-old female with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma presented with biliary obstruction and jaundice. The CT scan showed a borderline resectable tumor with a clear involvement of the gastroduodenal artery but doubtful relationships with the hepatic artery. Our team in collaboration with the Immersive Touch team used multiple series from the CT and segmented the relevant anatomy to understand the physical location of the tumor. An STL file was then developed and printed.\nReconstructing and compositing the different series together enhanced the imaging, which allowed clearer observations of the relationship between the mass and the blood vessels, and evidence that the tumor was unresectable. Data files were converted for printing a 100% size rendering model, used for didactic purposes and to discuss with the patient.\nThis study showed that (1) reconstructing enhanced traditional imaging by merging and modeling different series together for a 3D view with diverse angles and transparency, allowing the observation of previously unapparent anatomical details; (2) with this new technology surgeons and residents can preobserve their planned surgical intervention, explore the patient-specific anatomy, and sharpen their procedure choices; (3) high-quality 3D printed models are increasingly useful not only in the clinical realm but also for personalized patient education.", "journal": "Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The manufacturing-process of high-aesthetic restorations from tooth-coloured restorative materials is currently dominated by manual manufacturing procedures and the outcome is highly dependent on the knowledge and skills of the performing dental technician. On the other hand, due to the simplicity of the manufacturing process, CAD/CAM restorations from different material classes gain more and more acceptance in the daily routine. Multi-layered restorations show significant aesthetic advantages versus monolithic ones, but are difficult to fabricate using digital technologies. The key element for the successful automated digital fabrication of aesthetic anterior restorations seems to be the form of the individual dentine core as defined by dentine enamel junction (DEJ) covered by a more transparent layer of material imitating the enamel layer to create the outer enamel surface (OES).

In this paper, we studied the effects of tissue regeneration on the static and fatigue behavior of selective laser melted porous titanium structures with three different porosities (i.e. 77, 81, and 85%). The porous structures were filled with four different polymeric materials with mechanical properties in the range of those observed for de novo bone (0.7GPa<E<1.5GPa) to simulate bone tissue regeneration into their pores. The static mechanical properties and fatigue behavior (S-N curves) of as-manufactured and filled porous structures were then determined. The static mechanical properties and fatigue life (including endurance limit) of the porous structures were found to increase by factors 2-7, even when they were filled with polymeric materials with relatively low mechanical properties. The relative increase in the mechanical properties was much higher for the porous structures with lower porosities. Moreover, the increase in the fatigue life was more notable as compared to the increase in the static mechanical properties. Such large values of increase in the mechanical properties with the progress of bone tissue regeneration have implications in terms of mechanical stimulus for bone tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2016-11-05", "authors": ["RHedayati", "SJanbaz", "MSadighi", "MMohammadi-Aghdam", "A AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.10.003"}

Hot-melt extrusion is a flexible and continuously operating technique which is a crucial part of a typical processing cycle of printed medicines. In this work we use hot-melt extrusion for manufacturing of medicinal films containing indomethacin (IND) and polycaprolactone (PCL), extruded strands with nitrofurantoin monohydrate (NFMH) and poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO), and feedstocks for 3D printed dosage forms with nitrofurantoin anhydrate (NFAH), hydroxyapatite (HA) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA). These feedstocks were printed into a prototype solid dosage form using a desktop 3D printer. These model formulations were characterized using near-infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) and, more specifically, the image analytical data were analysed using multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). The MCR-ALS algorithm predicted the spatial distribution of IND and PCL in the films with reasonable accuracy. In the extruded strands both the chemical mapping of the components in the formulation as well as the solid form of the active compound could be visualized. Based on the image information the total nitrofurantoin and PEO contents could be estimated., The dehydration of NFMH to NFAH, a process-induced solid form change, could be visualized as well. It was observed that the level of dehydration increased with increasing processing time (recirculation during the mixing phase of molten PEO and nitrofurantoin). Similar results were achieved in the 3D printed solid dosage forms produced from the extruded feedstocks. The results presented in this work clearly demonstrate that NIR-CI in combination with MCR-ALS can be used for chemical mapping of both active compound and excipients, as well as for visualization of solid form variation in the final product.

{"title": "Low-Voltage Continuous Electrospinning Patterning.", "abstract": "Electrospinning is a versatile technique for the construction of microfibrous and nanofibrous structures with considerable potential in applications ranging from textile manufacturing to tissue engineering scaffolds. In the simplest form, electrospinning uses a high voltage of tens of thousands volts to draw out ultrafine polymer fibers over a large distance. However, the high voltage limits the flexible combination of material selection, deposition substrate, and control of patterns. Prior studies show that by performing electrospinning with a well-defined \"near-field\" condition, the operation voltage can be decreased to the kilovolt range, and further enable more precise patterning of fibril structures on a planar surface. In this work, by using solution dependent \"initiators\", we demonstrate a further lowering of voltage with an ultralow voltage continuous electrospinning patterning (LEP) technique, which reduces the applied voltage threshold to as low as 50 V, simultaneously permitting direct fiber patterning. The versatility of LEP is shown using a wide range of combination of polymer and solvent systems for thermoplastics and biopolymers. Novel functionalities are also incorporated when a low voltage mode is used in place of a high voltage mode, such as direct printing of living bacteria; the construction of suspended single fibers and membrane networks.

Three directional phase contrast MRI (4D Flow) has been proposed as one method for quantification of the CSF dynamics in healthy and disease states, but prior to further implementation of this technique, its accuracy in measuring CSF velocity magnitude and distribution must be evaluated. In this study, an MR-compatible experimental platform was developed based on an anatomically detailed 3D printed model of the cervical subarachnoid space and subject specific flow boundary conditions. Accuracy of 4D Flow measurements was assessed by comparison of CSF velocities obtained within the in vitro model with the numerically predicted velocities calculated from a spatially averaged computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the same geometry and flow boundary conditions. Good agreement was observed between CFD and 4D Flow in terms of spatial distribution and peak magnitude of through-plane velocities with an average difference of 7.5 and 10.6% for peak systolic and diastolic velocities, respectively. Regression analysis showed lower accuracy of 4D Flow measurement at the timeframes corresponding to low CSF flow rate and poor correlation between CFD and 4D Flow in-plane velocities.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-11-04", "authors": ["SoroushHeidari Pahlavian", "Alexander CBunck", "SurajThyagaraj", "DanielGiese", "FrancisLoth", "Dennis MHedderich", "Jan RobertKr\u00f6ger", "Bryn AMartin"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-016-1602-x"}

In this work, we reported manufacturing of complex structures with tough PIC hydrogels based on three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. The strategy relies on the distinct strength of ionic bonding in PIC hydrogels at different stages of printing. In concentrated saline solution, PIC forms viscous solution, which can be directly extruded out of a nozzle into water, where dialyzing out of salt and counterions results in sol-gel transition to form tough physical PIC gel with intricate structures. The printability of PIC solutions was systematically investigated by adjusting the PIC material formula and printing parameters in which proper viscosity and gelation rate were found to be key factors for successful 3D printing. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to printed single fibers and multilayer grids, both exhibiting distinct yet controllable strength and toughness. More complex 3D structures with negative Poisson's ratio, gradient grid, and material anisotropy were constructed as well, demonstrating the flexible printability of PIC hydrogels.

A limitation frequently encountered in AM models is a lack of indication about their precision and accuracy. Often overlooked, information on model uncertainty is required for validation of AM models, qualification of AM-produced parts, and uncertainty management. This paper presents a discussion on the origin and propagation of uncertainty in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) models. Four sources of uncertainty are identified: modeling assumptions, unknown simulation parameters, numerical approximations, and measurement error in calibration data. Techniques to quantify uncertainty in each source are presented briefly, along with estimation algorithms to diminish prediction uncertainty with the incorporation of online measurements. The methods are illustrated with a case study based on a transient, stochastic thermal model designed for melt pool width predictions. Model uncertainty is quantified for single track experiments and the effect of online estimation in overhanging structures is studied via simulation. The application of these concepts to estimation and control of the L-PBF process is suggested.", "journal": "Journal of mechanical design (New York, N.Y. : 1990)", "date": "2016-11-01", "authors": ["FelipeLopez", "PaulWitherell", "BrandonLane"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4034103"}

The current process involves producing a lead mask in order to protect the healthy tissue from the effects of the radiotherapy. The mask is produced by applying a thermoplastic sheet to the patient's face and allowing to set hard. This can then be used as a mould to create a plaster impression of the patient's face. A sheet of lead is then hammered on to the plaster to create a bespoke fitted face mask. This process can be distressing for patients and can be problematic when the patient is required to remain motionless for a prolonged time while the thermoplastic sets. In this study, a 1:1 scale 3D print of a patient's face was generated using a laser scanner. The lead was hammered directly on to the surface of the 3D print in order to create a bespoke fitted treatment mask. This eliminated the thermoplastic moulding stage and significantly reduced the time needed for the patient to be in clinic.

RSNOs are carriers of nitric oxide (NO) that play several physiological and physiopathological roles. The quantification of RSNOs relies on their decomposition using several protocols and the colorimetric detection of the final product, NO or nitrite. \u03bcPADs were fabricated by wax printing technology in a geometry containing one central zone for the sample inlet and eight circular detection zones interconnected by microfluidic channels for decomposition and posterior detection of decayed products. Different decomposition protocols including mercuric ions and light (UV, visible, and infrared) were tested on \u03bcPADs. For this purpose, a 3D printed holder was coupled with \u03bcPADs to easily design a simultaneous decomposition procedure using different light sources. The Griess reagent was added to detect NO and nitrite produced by the different decomposition methods. \u03bcPADs were then scanned using a flat board scanner and calibration curves based on color intensity were plotted. The limit of detection (LOD) values achieved for nitrite (used as a reference compound) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) using mercuric decomposition were 3 and 4 \u03bcM, respectively. The LOD reported herein for nitrite is considered among the lowest LODs already reported for this compound using \u03bcPADs. The results also show that low-molecular-weight RSNO, namely S-nitrosocysteine, decomposes more easily than high-molecular-weight RSNOs with light. As a proof of concept, RSNOs in human plasma were successfully detected on \u03bcPADs. For this purpose, a preliminary treatment step was optimized and the presence of high-molecular-weight (HMW) RSNOs was evidenced in the available plasma samples.

The main drivers for this growth are easing the workflow of dentists and increasing the comfort of patients. Therefore, remarkable research projects have been conducted and are currently underway to develop improved or new dental materials with enhanced properties or that can be processed using advanced technologies, such as CAD/CAM or 3D printing. Among these materials, zirconia, glass or polymer-infiltrated ceramics, and glass-ceramics (GCs) are of great importance. Dental glass-ceramics are highly attractive because they are easy to process and have outstanding esthetics, translucency, low thermal conductivity, high strength, chemical durability, biocompatibility, wear resistance, and hardness similar to that of natural teeth, and, in certain cases, these materials are bioactive. In this review article, we divide dental GCs into the following two groups: restorative and bioactive. Most restorative dental glass-ceramics (RDGCs) are inert and biocompatible and are used in the restoration and reconstruction of teeth. Bioactive dental glass-ceramics (BDGCs) display bone-bonding ability and stimulate positive biological reactions at the material/tissue interface. BDGCs are suggested for dentin hypersensitivity treatment, implant coating, bone regeneration and periodontal therapy. Throughout this paper, we elaborate on the history, processing, properties and applications of RDGCs and BDGCs.

In this study, we developed a biomimetic bone matrix using 3D bioprinting technology to investigate the interaction between breast cancer (BrCa) cells and bone stromal cells (fetal osteoblasts and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)). A tabletop stereolithography 3D bioprinter was employed to fabricate a series of bone matrices consisting of osteoblasts or MSCs encapsulated in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nHA). When BrCa cells were introduced into the stromal cell-laden bioprinted matrices, we found that the growth of BrCa cells was enhanced by the presence of osteoblasts or MSCs, whereas the proliferation of the osteoblasts or MSCs was inhibited by the BrCa cells. The BrCa cells co-cultured with MSCs or osteoblasts presented increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in comparison to that of monocultured BrCa cells. Additionally, the alkaline phosphatase activity of MSCs or osteoblasts was reduced after BrCa cell co-culture. These results demonstrate that the 3D bioprinted matrix, with BrCa cells and bone stromal cells, provides a suitable model with which to study the interactive effects of cells in the context of an artificial bone microenvironment and thus may serve as a valuable tool for the investigation of postmetastatic breast cancer progression in bone.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-10-30", "authors": ["XuanZhou", "WeiZhu", "MargaretNowicki", "ShidaMiao", "HaitaoCui", "BenjaminHolmes", "Robert IGlazer", "Lijie GraceZhang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b10673"}
{"title": "Layerless fabrication with continuous liquid interface production.", "abstract": "Despite the increasing popularity of 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), the technique has not developed beyond the realm of rapid prototyping. This confinement of the field can be attributed to the inherent flaws of layer-by-layer printing and, in particular, anisotropic mechanical properties that depend on print direction, visible by the staircasing surface finish effect. Continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) is an alternative approach to AM that capitalizes on the fundamental principle of oxygen-inhibited photopolymerization to generate a continual liquid interface of uncured resin between the growing part and the exposure window. This interface eliminates the necessity of an iterative layer-by-layer process, allowing for continuous production. Herein we report the advantages of continuous production, specifically the fabrication of layerless parts. These advantages enable the fabrication of large overhangs without the use of supports, reduction of the staircasing effect without compromising fabrication time, and isotropic mechanical properties.

In the test group, 3DPT was applied to build the 3D facture model of a patient, according to the data acquired from the thin-layer CT scan and subsequently processed with Mimics software. This helped to confirm the diagnosis, design the individual operation plan, simulate the surgical procedures and perform the surgery as plan. In the control group, only thin-layer CT scan was applied for the design of the operation plan prior to the surgery. Here, parameters including surgery duration, blood loss volume during surgery, the number of fluoroscopy, time to union were statistically analyzed for two groups after the operation. The screw lengths designed before the surgery and measured during the surgery were compared.\nThe 3D PHF model generated using 3DPT was able to provide the visual display and omni-directional observation of the direction and severity of the fracture dislocation, which facilitated preoperative diagnosis, operation planning and design, data measurement, preselection of internal fixator and surgical outcome simulation. According to the follow-up ranging from 12\u223c28\u00a0months for the 66\u00a0patients, the results showed no significant difference in time to union between the two groups (P>0.05). Apart from that, less surgery duration, less blood loss during surgery, less number of fluoroscopy can be observed compared with the control group (P<0.05).\nIn this study, 3DPT showed great clinical feasibility of the treatment of complicated PHFs. The 3D-print PHF model had the ability to clearly display the fracture and thus was useful to determine the fracture classification and the magnitude of fracture injury. It benefited surgeons to gain a better understanding of complicated PHFs, design a most suitable operation plan prior to surgery and facilitate the doctor-patient communication.

{"title": "Modular construction of multi-subunit protein complexes using engineered tags and microbial transglutaminase.", "abstract": "Motivations for the hierarchical assembly of protein complexes are diverse spanning biosensing, biomedical and bioreactor applications. The assembly processes should be simple, scalable, versatile, and biologically benign to minimize loss of component parts. A \"plug and play\" methodology comprising a generic linking apparatus may enable rapid design and optimization. One application that desires these qualities is metabolon construction wherein multiple enzymes are organized in defined pathways to mediate biochemical flux. Here, we propose a modular design by incorporation of crosslinking-compliant amino acid tags comprised of lysine or glutamine residues at the N- or C-termini of the to-be-assembled proteins. These amino acid tags enable covalent crosslinking using microbial transglutaminase (mTG). Modularity is demonstrated where stoichiometries and relative positions of enzymes and other functional proteins are altered. Construction of multifunctional complexes is demonstrated by crosslinking domains of different function and origin. Namely, we built a two-subunit quorum sensing (QS) biosynthetic metabolon on solid supports and altered stoichiometries of the limiting constituents to increase the overall rate of reaction. To display functionality beyond biosynthesis, we constructed a molecular communication 'device' (antibody binding Protein G-QS complex) to target bacterial cells and demonstrated tailored QS responses among targeted bacteria. We propose that this approach, solid phase mTG-mediated linkage of biological components, can be used for assembly within many environments including microreactors or lab-on-a-chip systems. Because the methodology is general, we envision construction of multi-functional protein complexes in a 'plug and play' fashion for a variety of biosensing and synthetic biology applications.", "journal": "Metabolic engineering", "date": "2016-10-30", "authors": ["NarendranathBhokisham", "HaigPakhchanian", "DavidQuan", "TanyaTschirhart", "Chen-YuTsao", "Gregory FPayne", "William EBentley"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymben.2016.05.004"}

However, the sizes of most reported gold 3D-PAs are too large (>300 nm) for in vivo applications as cancer theranostic agents because a size of about 200 nm is often considered to be the upper limit for successful drug delivery based on the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect.

In this work, we probe the 3D-printable biomaterials spectrum by combining two recently established functional 3D-printable particle-laden biomaterial inks: one that contains hydroxyapatite microspheres (hyperelastic bone, HB) and another that contains graphene nanoflakes (3D-graphene, 3DG). We demonstrate that not only can these distinct, osteogenic, and neurogenic inks be co-3D-printed to create complex, multimaterial constructs, but that composite inks of HB and 3DG can also be synthesized. Specifically, the printability, microstructural, mechanical, electrical, and biological properties of a hybrid material comprised of 1:1 HA:graphene by volume is investigated. The resulting HB-3DG hybrid exhibits mixed characteristics of the two distinct systems, while maintaining 3D-printability, electrical conductivity, and flexibility.

The cellular alignment and the shape of the tissue constructs are controlled by 3D cell-printing technology. mdECM bioink provides the 3D cell-printed muscle constructs with a myogenic environment that supports high viability and contractility as well as myotube formation, differentiation, and maturation. More interestingly, the preservation of agrin is confirmed in the mdECM, and significant increases in the formation of acetylcholine receptor clusters are exhibited in the 3D cell-printed muscle constructs. In conclusion, mdECM bioink and 3D cell-printing technology facilitate the mimicking of both the structural and functional properties of native muscle and hold great promise for producing clinically relevant engineered muscle for the treatment of muscular injuries.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2016-10-27", "authors": ["Yeong-JinChoi", "Taek GyoungKim", "JonghyeonJeong", "Hee-GyeongYi", "Ji WonPark", "WoonbongHwang", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201600483"}

We implemented a new clinical workflow in which 3D printing technology is used to create the bolus.\nA patient-specific bolus is designed in the treatment planning system (TPS) and a shell around it is created in the TPS. The shell is printed and subsequently filled with silicone rubber to make the bolus. Before clinical implementation we performed a planning study with 11 patients to evaluate the difference in tumour coverage between the designed 3D-print bolus and the clinically delivered plan with manually created bolus. For the first 15 clinical patients a second CT scan with the 3D-print bolus was performed to verify the geometrical accuracy.\nThe planning study showed that the V85% of the CTV was on average 97% (3D-print) vs 88% (conventional). Geometric comparison of the 3D-print bolus to the originally contoured bolus showed a high similarity (DSC=0.89). The dose distributions on the second CT scan with the 3D print bolus in position showed only small differences in comparison to the original planning CT scan.\nThe implemented workflow is feasible, patient friendly, safe, and results in high quality dose distributions.

Different patterns of design can lead to various mechanical properties and biocompatibility to various degrees. However, there is still a long way to go before we can fully take advantage of 3D printing technologies.\nThis study tailored 3D printed scaffolds with gelatin and platelets to maximize bone regeneration. The scaffolds were designed with special internal porous structures that can allow bone tissue and large molecules to infiltrate better into the scaffolds. They were then treated with gelatin and platelets via thermo-crosslinking and freeze-drying, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 were measured at different time points after the scaffolds had been made. Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were determined via cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay.\nThere was a massive boost in the level of VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 released by the scaffolds with gelatin and platelets compared to that of scaffolds with only gelatin. After 21 days of culture, the CCK-8 cell counts of the control group and treated group were significantly higher than that of the blank group (P < 0.05). The cytotoxicity test also indicated the safety of the scaffolds.\nOur experiments confirmed that the 3D printed scaffolds we had designed could provide a sustained-release effect for growth factors and improve the proliferation of preosteoblasts with little cytotoxicity in vitro.

In order to facilitate the spectrometer placement inside the gantry, supporting structures including a cover and a stand were dedicatedly designed and printed using a 3D printer. According to the relative position between the spectrometer and the stand, the upright projection of the spectrometer collimator onto the stand was determined and then marked by a tungsten pinhole. Thus, a visible alignment indicator of the X-ray central beam and the spectrometer collimator represented by the pinhole was established in the micro-CT live mode. Then, a rough alignment could be achieved through repeatedly adjusting and imaging the stand until the pinhole was located at the center of the acquired projection image. With the spectrometer being positioned back onto the stand, the precise alignment was completed by slightly translating the spectrometer-stand assembly around the rough location, until finding a \"sweet spot\" with the highest photon rate and proper distribution of the X-ray photons in the resultant spectrum. The spectra were acquired under precise alignment and misalignment of approximately 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0mm away from the precise alignment position, and then were compared in qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitative analysis results show that, with slight misalignment, the photon rate is reduced from 1302 to 1098, 1031, and 416 photons/second (p/s), respectively, and the characteristic peaks in the acquired spectra are gradually deteriorated.

Organ engineering is a discipline that integrates biological knowledge of embryological development, anatomy, physiology, and cellular interactions with enabling technologies including biocompatible biomaterials and biofabrication platforms such as three-dimensional bioprinting.

Technological advances in biomaterials, biofabrication, and biomedical imaging allow for in vitro control of these factors to recreate in vivo phenomena.

This original engineered tissue of tightly joined Schwann cells obtained in a conduit lumen having 400 \u03bcm in diameter is a consequence of specific cell-material interactions. In the present work we analyze the influence of the hydrogel concentration and of the drying process on the physicochemical and biological performance of the resulting tubular scaffolds, and prove that the cylinder-like cell sheath obtains also in scaffolds of a larger inner diameter. The diffusion of glucose and of the protein BSA through the scaffolds is studied and characterized, as well as the enzymatic degradation kinetics of the lyophilized conduits. This can be modulated from a couple of weeks to several months by varying the concentration of hyaluronic acid in the starting solution.

Mg alloys possess advantageous properties that make them the most extensively studied biodegradable metallic material for orthopedic applications such as their low density, modulus of elasticity, close to that of the bone, and resorbability. Early resorption (i.e., <3months) and relatively inadequate strength are the main challenges that hinder the use of Mg alloys for bone fixation applications. The development of resorbable Mg-based bone fixation hardware with superior mechanical and corrosion performance requires a thorough understanding of the physical and mechanical properties of Mg alloys. This paper discusses the characteristics of successful Mg-based skeletal fixation hardware and the possible ways to improve its properties using different methods such as mechanical and heat treatment processes.

While addressing such twin requirements, the present study demonstrates a low temperature additive manufacturing based processing strategy to fabricate Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds with designed porosity using inkjet-based 3D powder printing (3DPP). A novel starch-based aqueous binder was prepared and the physico-chemical parameters such as pH, viscosity, and surface tension were optimized for drop-on-demand (DOD) based thermal inkjet printing. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of sintered scaffolds revealed a 57% total porosity in homogeneously porous scaffold and 45% in the gradient porous scaffold with 99% interconnectivity among the micropores. Under uniaxial compression testing, the strength of homogeneously porous and gradient porous scaffolds were ~47MPa and ~90MPa, respectively. The progressive failure in homogeneously porous scaffold was recorded. In parallel to experimental measurements, finite element (FE) analyses have been performed to study the stress distribution globally and also locally around the designed pores. Consistent with FE analyses, a higher elastic modulus was recorded with gradient porous scaffolds (~3GPa) than the homogenously porous scaffolds (~2GPa). While comparing with the existing literature reports, the present work, for the first time, establishes 'direct powder printing methodology' of Ti-6Al-4V porous scaffolds with biomedically relevant microstructural and mechanical properties. Also, a new FE analysis approach, based on the critical understanding of the porous architecture using micro-CT results, is presented to realistically predict the compression response of porous scaffolds.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Preferential Rotation of Chiral Dipoles in Isotropic Turbulence.", "abstract": "We introduce a new particle shape which shows preferential rotation in three dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We call these particles chiral dipoles because they consist of a rod with two helices of opposite handedness, one at each end. 3D printing is used to fabricate these particles with a length in the inertial range and their rotations are tracked in a turbulent flow between oscillating grids. High aspect ratio chiral dipoles preferentially align with their long axis along the extensional eigenvectors of the strain rate tensor, and the helical ends respond to the extensional strain rate with a mean spinning rate that is nonzero. We use Stokesian dynamics simulations of chiral dipoles in pure strain flow to quantify the dependence of spinning on particle shape. Based on the known response to pure strain, we build a model that gives the spinning rate of small chiral dipoles using velocity gradients along Lagrangian trajectories from high resolution direct numerical simulations. The statistics of chiral dipole spinning determined with this model show surprisingly good agreement with the measured spinning of much larger chiral dipoles in the experiments.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2016-10-22", "authors": ["StefanKramel", "Greg AVoth", "SaskiaTympel", "FedericoToschi"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.154501"}
{"title": "Design and Printing Strategies in 3D Bioprinting of Cell-Hydrogels: A Review.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is an emerging technology that allows the assembling of both living and non-living biological materials into an ideal complex layout for further tissue maturation. Bioprinting aims to produce engineered tissue or organ in a mechanized, organized, and optimized manner. Various biomaterials and techniques have been utilized to bioprint biological constructs in different shapes, sizes and resolutions. There is a need to systematically discuss and analyze the reported strategies employed to fabricate these constructs. We identified and discussed important design factors in bioprinting, namely shape and resolution, material heterogeneity, and cellular-material remodeling dynamism. Each design factors are represented by the corresponding process capabilities and printing parameters. The process-design map will inspire future biomaterials research in these aspects. Design considerations such as data processing, bio-ink formulation and process selection are discussed. Various printing and crosslinking strategies, with relevant applications, are also systematically reviewed. We categorized them into 5 general bioprinting strategies, including direct bioprinting, in-process crosslinking, post-process crosslinking, indirect bioprinting and hybrid bioprinting. The opportunities and outlook in 3D bioprinting are highlighted.

Here, silver (Ag), gold (Au) and their bimetallic (Ag/Au) nanoparticles (NPs) were green synthesized using the Gloriosa superba aqueous leaf extract. Metal NPs were studied by spectroscopic (UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD and EDX) and microscopic (AFM and TEM) analysis. AFM and TEM showed that Ag and Au NPs had triangular and spherical morphologies, with an average size of 20\u00a0nm. Bimetallic Ag/Au NPs showed spherical shapes with an average size of 10\u00a0nm. Ag and Ag/Au bimetallic NPs showed high antibacterial and antibiofilm activities towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Overall, the proposed synthesis route of Ag, Au and Ag/Au bimetallic NPs can be exploited by the pharmaceutical industry to develop drugs effective in the fight against microbic infections.", "journal": "Microbial pathogenesis", "date": "2016-10-22", "authors": ["KasiGopinath", "ShanmugasundaramKumaraguru", "KasiBhakyaraj", "SubramanianMohan", "Kunga SukumaranVenkatesh", "MasanamEsakkirajan", "PeriyannanKaleeswarran", "Naiyf SAlharbi", "ShineKadaikunnan", "MarimuthuGovindarajan", "GiovanniBenelli", "AyyakannuArumugam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micpath.2016.10.011"}

{"title": "3D printing of biomaterials with mussel-inspired nanostructures for tumor therapy and tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Primary bone cancer brings patients great sufferings. To deal with the bone defects resulted from cancer surgery, biomaterials with good bone-forming ability are necessary to repair bone defects. Meanwhile, in order to prevent possible tumor recurrence, it is essential that the remaining tumor cells around bone defects are completely killed. However, there are few biomaterials with the ability of both cancer therapy and bone regeneration until now. Here, we fabricated a 3D-printed bioceramic scaffold with a uniformly self-assembled Ca-P/polydopamine nanolayer surface. Taking advantage of biocompatibility, biodegradability and the excellent photothermal effect of polydopamine, the bifunctional scaffolds with mussel-inspired nanostructures could be used as a satisfactory and controllable photothermal agent, which effectively induced tumor cell death in\u00a0vitro, and significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice. In addition, owing to the nanostructured surface, the prepared polydopamine-modified bioceramic scaffolds could support the attachment and proliferation of rabbit bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs), and significantly promoted the formation of new bone tissues in rabbit bone defects even under photothermal treatment. Therefore, the mussel-inspired nanostructures in 3D-printed bioceramic exhibited a remarkable capability for both cancer therapy and bone regeneration, offering a promising strategy to construct bifunctional biomaterials which could be widely used for therapy of tumor-induced tissue defects.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-10-22", "authors": ["HongshiMa", "JianLuo", "ZheSun", "LunguoXia", "MengchaoShi", "MingyaoLiu", "JiangChang", "ChengtieWu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.005"}

{"title": "OptoZIF Drive: a 3D printed implant and assembly tool package for neural recording and optical stimulation in freely moving mice.", "abstract": "Behavioral neuroscience studies in freely moving rodents require small, light-weight implants to facilitate neural recording and stimulation. Our goal was to develop an integrated package of 3D printed parts and assembly aids for labs to rapidly fabricate, with minimal training, an implant that combines individually positionable microelectrodes, an optical fiber, zero insertion force (ZIF-clip) headstage connection, and secondary recording electrodes, e.g. for electromyography (EMG).\nStarting from previous implant designs that position recording electrodes using a control screw, we developed an implant where the main drive body, protective shell, and non-metal components of the microdrives are 3D printed in parallel. We compared alternative shapes and orientations of circuit boards for electrode connection to the headstage, in terms of their size, weight, and ease of wire insertion. We iteratively refined assembly methods, and integrated additional assembly aids into the 3D printed casing.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the OptoZIF Drive by performing real time optogenetic feedback in behaving mice. A novel feature of the OptoZIF Drive is its vertical circuit board, which facilities direct ZIF-clip connection. This feature requires angled insertion of an optical fiber that still can exit the drive from the center of a ring of recording electrodes. We designed an innovative 2-part protective shell that can be installed during the implant surgery to facilitate making additional connections to the circuit board. We use this feature to show that facial EMG in mice can be used as a control signal to lock stimulation to the animal's motion, with stable EMG signal over several months. To decrease assembly time, reduce assembly errors, and improve repeatability, we fabricate assembly aids including a drive holder, a drill guide, an implant fixture for microelectode 'pinning', and a gold plating fixture.\nThe expanding capability of optogenetic tools motivates continuing development of small optoelectric devices for stimulation and recording in freely moving mice. The OptoZIF Drive is the first to natively support ZIF-clip connection to recording hardware, which further supports a decrease in implant cross-section. The integrated 3D printed package of drive components and assembly tools facilities implant construction. The easy interfacing and installation of auxiliary electrodes makes the OptoZIF Drive especially attractive for real time feedback stimulation experiments.", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["David SFreedman", "Joseph BSchroeder", "Gregory ITelian", "ZhengyangZhang", "SmrithiSunil", "Jason TRitt"], "doi": "10.1088/1741-2560/13/6/066013"}

The creation of 3D prints displaying patient-specific anatomical pathology for surgical planning and interventions is an emerging field. Here we explored the possibility of taking rare pediatric radiographic data sets to create 3D prints for surgical education.\nMagnetic resonance imaging data of 2 children (8 and 14 months) were segmented, colored, and anonymized, and stereolothographic files were prepared for 3D printing on either multicolor plastic or powder 3D printers and multimaterial 3D printers.\nTwo models were deemed of sufficient quality and anatomical accuracy to print unamended. One data set was further manipulated digitally to artificially extend the length of the cleft. Thus, 3 models were printed: 1 incomplete soft-palate deformity, 1 incomplete anterior palate deformity, and 1 complete cleft palate. All had cleft lip deformity. The single-material 3D prints are of sufficient quality to accurately identify the nature and extent of the deformities. Multimaterial prints were subsequently created, which could be valuable in surgical training.\nImprovements in the quality and resolution of radiographic imaging combined with the advent of multicolor multiproperty printer technology will make it feasible in the near future to print 3D replicas in materials that mimic the mechanical properties and color of live human tissue making them potentially suitable for surgical training.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Structural dynamics of the welding assembly and work piece influence how energy is transferred during the process and ultimately, part quality. To understand the effect of structural dynamics during UAM, a linear time-invariant model is proposed to relate the inputs of shear force and electric current to resultant welder velocity and voltage. Measured frequency response and operating performance of the welder under no load is used to identify model parameters. Using this model and in-situ measurements, shear force and welder efficiency are estimated to be near 2000N and 80% when welding Al 6061-H18 weld foil, respectively. Shear force and welder efficiency have never been estimated before in UAM. The influence of processing conditions, i.e., welder amplitude, normal force, and weld speed, on shear force and welder efficiency are investigated. Welder velocity was found to strongly influence the shear force magnitude and efficiency while normal force and weld speed showed little to no influence.

The tissue roll for analysis of cellular environment and response (TRACER) is a novel strategy to assemble layered, three-dimensional tumours with cell-defined, graded heterogeneous microenvironments that also facilitates cellular separation and stratification of data from different cell populations from specific microenvironments. Here we describe the materials selection and development of TRACER.

We explore ECM remodeling and long-term cell growth in the scaffold, and characterize the tumour microenvironment in assembled TRACERs using multiple established analysis methods. Finally, we confirm that TRACERs replicate small molecule gradients of glucose and lactate, and explore cell phenotype associated with these gradients using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and quantitative PCR analysis.

{"title": "Bioprinted thrombosis-on-a-chip.", "abstract": "Pathologic thrombosis kills more people than cancer and trauma combined; it is associated with significant disability and morbidity, and represents a major healthcare burden. Despite advancements in medical therapies and imaging, there is often incomplete resolution of the thrombus. The residual thrombus can undergo fibrotic changes over time through infiltration of fibroblasts from the surrounding tissues and eventually transform into a permanent clot often associated with post-thrombotic syndrome. In order to understand the importance of cellular interactions and the impact of potential therapeutics to treat thrombosis, an in vitro platform using human cells and blood components would be beneficial. Towards achieving this aim, there have been studies utilizing the capabilities of microdevices to study the hemodynamics associated with thrombosis. In this work, we further exploited the utilization of 3D bioprinting technology, for the construction of a highly biomimetic thrombosis-on-a-chip model. The model consisted of microchannels coated with a layer of confluent human endothelium embedded in a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel, where human whole blood was infused and induced to form thrombi. Continuous perfusion with tissue plasmin activator led to dissolution of non-fibrotic clots, revealing clinical relevance of the model. Further encapsulating fibroblasts in the GelMA matrix demonstrated the potential migration of these cells into the clot and subsequent deposition of collagen type I over time, facilitating fibrosis remodeling that resembled the in vivo scenario. Our study suggests that in vitro 3D bioprinted blood coagulation models can be used to study the pathology of fibrosis, and particularly, in thrombosis.

The potential long term complications with use of inert biometals have opened the opportunities for use of biodegradable metals in the clinical arena. The authors previously reported that binder-jet 3D printing technique enhanced the degradation rates of biodegradable Fe-Mn alloy by creating engineered micropores rendering the system attractive as biodegradable implantable devices. In the present study, the authors employed CALPHAD modeling to systematically study and modify the Fe-Mn alloy composition to achieve enhanced degradation rates. Accordingly, Ca and Mg addition to Fe-35wt% Mn solid solution predicted increase in degradation rates. In order to validate the CALPHAD results, Fe - (35-y)wt% Mn - ywt% X (X=Ca, Mg, and y=0, 1, 2) were synthesized by using high energy mechanical alloying (HEMA). Sintered pellets of Fe-Mn-Ca and Fe-Mn-Mg were then subjected to potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and live/dead cell viability tests. Sintered pellets of Fe-Mn, Fe-Mn-Ca, and Fe-Mn-Mg also exhibited MC3T3 murine pre-osteoblast cells viability in the live/dead assay results. Fe-Mn and Fe-Mn-1Ca were thus accordingly selected for 3D printing and the results further confirmed enhanced degradation of Ca addition to 3D printed constructs validating the theoretical and alloy development studies. Live/dead and MTT cell viability results also confirmed good cytocompatibility of the 3D-printed Fe-Mn and Fe-Mn-1Ca constructs.\nBone grafting is widely used for the treatment of cranio-maxillofacial bone injuries. 3D printing of biodegradable Fe alloy is anticipated to be advantageous over current bone grafting techniques. 3D printing offers the fabrication of precise and tailored bone grafts to fit the patient specific bone defect needs. Biodegradable Fe alloy is a good candidate for 3D printing synthetic grafts to regenerate bone tissue without eliciting complications. CALPHAD theoretical models were used to develop new Fe-Mn-Ca/Mg alloys to enhance the degradation rates of traditional Fe-Mn alloys.

{"title": "Cell sheet mechanics: How geometrical constraints induce the detachment of cell sheets from concave surfaces.", "abstract": "Despite of the progress made to engineer structured microtissues such as BioMEMS and 3D bioprinting, little control exists how microtissues transform as they mature, as the misbalance between cell-generated forces and the strength of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts can result in unintended tissue deformations and ruptures. To develop a quantitative perspective on how cellular contractility, scaffold curvature and cell-substrate adhesion control such rupture processes, human aortic smooth muscle cells were grown on glass substrates with submillimeter semichannels. We quantified cell sheet detachment from 3D confocal image stacks as a function of channel curvature and cell sheet tension by adding different amounts of Blebbistatin and TGF-\u03b2 to inhibit or enhance cell contractility, respectively. We found that both higher curvature and higher contractility increased the detachment probability. Variations of the adhesive strength of the protein coating on the substrate revealed that the rupture plane was localized along the substrate-extracellular matrix interface for non-covalently adsorbed adhesion proteins, while the collagen-integrin interface ruptured when collagen I was covalently crosslinked to the substrate. Finally, a simple mechanical model is introduced that quantitatively explains how the tuning of substrate curvature, cell sheet contractility and adhesive strength can be used as tunable parameters as summarized in a first semi-quantitative phase diagram. These parameters can thus be exploited to either inhibit or purposefully induce a collective detachment of sheet-like microtissues for the use in tissue engineering and regenerative therapies.\nDespite of the significant progress in 3D tissue fabrication technologies at the microscale, there is still no quantitative model that can predict if cells seeded on a 3D structure maintain the imposed geometry while they form a continuous microtissue. Especially, detachment or loss of shape control of growing tissue is a major concern when designing 3D-structured scaffolds. Utilizing semi-cylindrical channels and vascular smooth muscle cells, we characterized how geometrical and mechanical parameters such as curvature of the substrate, cellular contractility, or protein-substrate adhesion strength tune the catastrophic detachment of microtissue. Observed results were rationalized by a theoretical model.

{"title": "3D Printing PDMS Elastomer in a Hydrophilic Support Bath via Freeform Reversible Embedding.", "abstract": "Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing.

{"title": "3D-printed patient-specific applications in orthopedics.", "abstract": "With advances in both medical imaging and computer programming, two-dimensional axial images can be processed into other reformatted views (sagittal and coronal) and three-dimensional (3D) virtual models that represent a patients' own anatomy. This processed digital information can be analyzed in detail by orthopedic surgeons to perform patient-specific orthopedic procedures. The use of 3D printing is rising and has become more prevalent in medical applications over the last decade as surgeons and researchers are increasingly utilizing the technology's flexibility in manufacturing objects. 3D printing is a type of manufacturing process in which materials such as plastic or metal are deposited in layers to create a 3D object from a digital model. This additive manufacturing method has the advantage of fabricating objects with complex freeform geometry, which is impossible using traditional subtractive manufacturing methods. Specifically in surgical applications, the 3D printing techniques can not only generate models that give a better understanding of the complex anatomy and pathology of the patients and aid in education and surgical training, but can also produce patient-specific surgical guides or even custom implants that are tailor-made to the surgical requirements. As the clinical workflow of the 3D printing technology continues to evolve, orthopedic surgeons should embrace the latest knowledge of the technology and incorporate it into their clinical practice for patient-specific orthopedic applications. This paper is written to help orthopedic surgeons stay up-to-date on the emerging 3D technology, starting from the acquisition of clinical imaging to 3D printing for patient-specific applications in orthopedics. It 1) presents the necessary steps to prepare the medical images that are required for 3D printing, 2) reviews the current applications of 3D printing in patient-specific orthopedic procedures, 3) discusses the potential advantages and limitations of 3D-printed custom orthopedic implants, and 4) suggests the directions for future development. The 3D printing technology has been reported to be beneficial in patient-specific orthopedics, such as in the creation of anatomic models for surgical planning, education and surgical training, patient-specific instruments, and 3D-printed custom implants. Besides being anatomically conformed to a patient's surgical requirement, 3D-printed implants can be fabricated with scaffold lattices that may facilitate osteointegration and reduce implant stiffness. However, limitations including high cost of the implants, the lead time in manufacturing, and lack of intraoperative flexibility need to be addressed. New biomimetic materials have been investigated for use in 3D printing. To increase utilization of 3D printing technology in orthopedics, an all-in-one computer platform should be developed for easy planning and seamless communications among different care providers. Further studies are needed to investigate the real clinical efficacy of 3D printings in orthopedic applications.", "journal": "Orthopedic research and reviews", "date": "2016-10-14", "authors": ["Kwok ChuenWong"], "doi": "10.2147/ORR.S99614"}

The biocompatibility of 3D hydrogel scaffolds was tested. Sixty nude mice were randomly divided into four groups, with 15 mice in each group: control, hydrogel, hydrogel with L02 (cell line HL-7702), and hydrogel with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).

High-quality simulation education relies on the availability, accessibility, and reliability of models. The objective of this work was to describe a practical pediatric laryngeal model for use in otolaryngology residency training. Ideally, this model would be low-cost, have tactile properties resembling human tissue, and be reliably reproducible.\nPediatric laryngeal models were developed using two manufacturing methods: direct three-dimensional (3D) printing of anatomical models and casted anatomical models using 3D-printed molds. Polylactic acid, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) were used for the directly printed models, whereas a silicone elastomer (SE) was used for the casted models.\nThe models were evaluated for anatomic quality, ease of manipulation, hardness, and cost of production. A tissue likeness scale was created to validate the simulation model. Fleiss' Kappa rating was performed to evaluate interrater agreement, and analysis of variance was performed to evaluate differences among the materials.\nThe SE provided the most anatomically accurate models, with the tactile properties allowing for surgical manipulation of the larynx. Direct 3D printing was more cost-effective than the SE casting method but did not possess the material properties and tissue likeness necessary for surgical simulation.\nThe SE models of the pediatric larynx created from a casting method demonstrated high quality anatomy, tactile properties comparable to human tissue, and easy manipulation with standard surgical instruments. Their use in a reliable, low-cost, accessible, modular simulation system provides a valuable training resource for otolaryngology residents.\nN/A.

Glioma stem cells achieved a survival rate of 86.92%, and proliferated with high cellular activity immediately following bioprinting.

However, they are usually difficult to develop, have a low throughput and are often costly; limiting their utility to most laboratories. The recent availability of inexpensive additive manufacturing printers and open source 3D design software offers us the possibility to easily create affordable 3D cell culture platforms. To demonstrate this, we established a simple, inexpensive and robust method for producing arrays of free-floating epithelial micro-tissues. Using a combination of 3D computer aided design and 3D printing, hydrogel micro-moulding and collagen cell encapsulation we engineered microenvironments that consistently direct the growth of micro-tissue arrays. We described the adaptability of this technique by testing several immortalised epithelial cell lines (MDCK, A549, Caco-2) and by generating branching morphology and micron to millimetre scaled micro-tissues. We established by fluorescence and electron microscopy that micro-tissues are polarised, have cell type specific differentiated phenotypes and regain native in vivo tissue qualities. Finally, using Salmonella typhimurium we show micro-tissues display a more physiologically relevant infection response compared to epithelial monolayers grown on permeable filter supports. In summary, we have developed a robust and adaptable technique for producing arrays of epithelial micro-tissues. This in vitro model has the potential to be a valuable tool for studying epithelial cell and tissue function/architecture in a physiologically relevant context.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-10-12", "authors": ["PFlood", "LAlvarez", "E GReynaud"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/4/045006"}

A possible solution may rely on the use of three-dimensional scaffolds with optimized structural properties in combination with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Bone presents a radial gradient structure from the outside, where the cortical bone is more compact (porosity ranging from 5% to 10%), toward the inner part, where the cancellous bone is more porous (porosity ranging from 50% to 90%). Here, we present a new scaffold design with a built-in gradient in porosity, which approximate the radial bone structure. The pores of the outer ring were 500 \u03bcm, the ones in the middle zone were 750 \u03bcm and the inner part presented pores of 1000 \u03bcm. The porosity of each scaffold region resembled the gradient present in bone, with the outer ring having a porosity of 29.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%, the middle and inner regions a porosity of 50.8%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1% and 77.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2% respectively. hMSCs behavior was analyzed in terms of growth, extracellular matrix deposition and differentiation toward the osteogenic lineage. A trend was displayed by the hMSCs residing in different zones of the gradient scaffolds after 7, 14 and 28 days of culture in mineralization medium. Osteogenic differentiation was influenced by pore size and location in scaffolds displaying a radial porosity gradient. Cell differentiation was confirmed by gene expression with upregulation of Runx2 and bone sialoprotein markers. Mineralization staining further confirmed the maturation of cell differentiation, as indicated by the presence of calcium and phosphate mineral deposits.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-10-12", "authors": ["AndreaDi Luca", "AlessiaLongoni", "GiuseppeCriscenti", "CarlosMota", "Clemensvan Blitterswijk", "LorenzoMoroni"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/4/045007"}

CCs choreograph liquid delivery operations according to pre-programmed capillary pressure differences with minimal user intervention. CCs were thought to require high-precision micron-scale features manufactured by conventional photolithography, which is slow and expensive. Here we present CCs manufactured rapidly and inexpensively using 3D-printed molds. Molds for CCs were fabricated with a benchtop 3D-printer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) replicas were made, and fluidic functionality was verified with aqueous solutions. We established design rules for CCs by a combination of modelling and experimentation. The functionality and reliability of trigger valves - an essential fluidic element that stops one liquid until flow is triggered by a second liquid - was tested for different geometries and different solutions. Trigger valves with geometries up to 80-fold larger than cleanroom-fabricated ones were found to function reliably. We designed retention burst valves that encode sequential liquid delivery using capillary pressure differences encoded by systematically varied heights and widths. Using an electrical circuit analogue of the CC, we established design rules to ensure strictly sequential liquid delivery. CCs autonomously delivered eight liquids in a pre-determined sequence in <7 min.

We have designed a quantitative, high-throughput platform to investigate the fusion of multicellular spheroids using agarose micro-molds. Spheroids of primary human chondrocytes (HCH) or human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were self-assembled for 24 h and then brought together to form an array comprised of two spheroids (one doublet) per well. To quantify spheroid fusogenicity, we developed two assays: (1) an initial tack assay, defined as the minimum amount of time for two spheroids to form a mechanically stable tissue complex or doublet, and (2) a fusion assay, in which we defined and tracked key morphological parameters of the doublets as a function of time using wide-field fluorescence microscopy over a 24 h time-lapse. The initial tack of spheroid fusion was measured by inverting the micro-molds and centrifuging doublets at various time points to assess their connectedness. We found that the initial tack between two spheroids forms rapidly, with the majority of doublets remaining intact after centrifugation following just 30 min of fusion. Over the course of 24 h of fusion, several morphological changes occurred, which were quantified using a custom image analysis pipeline. End-to-end doublet lengths decreased over time, doublet widths decreased for chondrocytes and increased for MCF-7, contact lengths increased over time, and chondrocyte doublets exhibited higher intersphere angles at the end of fusion. We also assessed fusion by measuring the fluorescence intensity at the plane of fusion, which increased over time for both cell types. Interestingly, we observed that doublets moved and rotated in the micro-wells during fusion and this rotation was inhibited by ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin.

Such models are commonly derived from computed tomography (CT) images using thresholding. Threshold selection can be performed manually or automatically. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of manual and default threshold selection on the reliability and accuracy of skull STL models using different CT technologies.\nOne female and one male human cadaver head were imaged using multi-detector row CT, dual-energy CT, and two cone-beam CT scanners. Four medical engineers manually thresholded the bony structures on all CT images. The lowest and highest selected mean threshold values and the default threshold value were used to generate skull STL models. Geometric variations between all manually thresholded STL models were calculated. Furthermore, in order to calculate the accuracy of the manually and default thresholded STL models, all STL models were superimposed on an optical scan of the dry female and male skulls (\"gold standard\").\nThe intra- and inter-observer variability of the manual threshold selection was good (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.9). All engineers selected grey values closer to soft tissue to compensate for bone voids. Geometric variations between the manually thresholded STL models were 0.13 mm (multi-detector row CT), 0.59 mm (dual-energy CT), and 0.55 mm (cone-beam CT).

{"title": "Improving the fatigue performance of porous metallic biomaterials produced by Selective Laser Melting.", "abstract": "This paper provides new insights into the fatigue properties of porous metallic biomaterials produced by additive manufacturing. Cylindrical porous samples with diamond unit cells were produced from Ti6Al4V powder using Selective Laser Melting (SLM). After measuring all morphological and quasi-static properties, compression-compression fatigue tests were performed to determine fatigue strength and to identify important fatigue influencing factors. In a next step, post-SLM treatments were used to improve the fatigue life of these biomaterials by changing the microstructure and by reducing stress concentrators and surface roughness. In particular, the influence of stress relieving, hot isostatic pressing and chemical etching was studied. Analytical and numerical techniques were developed to calculate the maximum local tensile stress in the struts as function of the strut diameter and load. With this method, the variability in the relative density between all samples was taken into account. The local stress in the struts was then used to quantify the exact influence of the applied post-SLM treatments on the fatigue life. A significant improvement of the fatigue life was achieved. Also, the post-SLM treatments, procedures and calculation methods can be applied to different types of porous metallic structures and hence this paper provides useful tools for improving fatigue performance of metallic biomaterials.\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM) techniques such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are increasingly being used for producing customized porous metallic biomaterials. These biomaterials are regularly used for biomedical implants and hence a long lifetime is required. In this paper, a set of post-built surface and heat treatments is presented that can be used to significantly improve the fatigue life of porous SLM-Ti6Al4V samples. In addition, a novel and efficient analytical local stress method was developed to accurately quantify the influence of the post-built treatments on the fatigue life. Also numerical simulation techniques were used for validation. The developed methods and techniques can be applied to other types of porous biomaterials and hence provide new and useful tools for improving and predicting the fatigue life of porous biomaterials.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-10-09", "authors": ["BrechtVan Hooreweder", "YanniApers", "KarelLietaert", "Jean-PierreKruth"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.10.005"}

Here, we report the extrusion-based 3D printing of biodegradable and photocurable acrylated polyglycerol sebacate (Acr-PGS) to fabricate scaffolds with elastic properties. Two Acr-PGS macromers were synthesized with varied molecular weights and viscosity, which were then blended to obtain photocurable macromer inks with a range of viscosities. The quality of extruded and photocured scaffolds was dependent on the initial ink viscosity, with flow of printed material resulting in a loss of structural resolution or sample breaking observed with too low or too high viscosity inks, respectively. However, scaffolds with high print resolution and up to ten layers were fabricated with an optimal ink viscosity. The mechanical properties of printed scaffolds were dependent on printing density, where the scaffolds with lower printing density possessed lower moduli and failure properties than higher density scaffolds. The 3D printed scaffolds supported the culture of 3T3 fibroblasts and both spreading and proliferation were observed, indicating that 3D printed Acr-PGS scaffolds are cytocompatible.

For mechanical property comparison in dry and wet conditions and cytocompatibility determination, we analyzed the rate and pattern of cell proliferation of seeded fibroblasts and preosteoblasts using the cell counting kit-8 assay and scanning electron microscopy. Osteogenic differentiation was verified using alizarin red S staining. At 8 weeks following implantation in vivo using beagle dogs, computed tomography and histological analyses were performed after sacrifice. Cell proliferation rates in vitro indicated that early cell attachment was higher in collagen than in PCL/PLGA/\u03b2-TCP membranes; however, the difference subsided by day 7. Similar outcomes were found for osteogenic differentiation, with approximately 2.5 times greater staining in collagen than PCL/PLGA/\u03b2-TCP, but without significant difference by day 14. In vivo, bone regeneration in the defect area, represented by new bone formation and bone-to-implant contact, paralleled those associated with collagen membranes. However, tensile testing revealed that whereas the PCL/PLGA/\u03b2-TCP membrane mechanical properties were conserved in both wet and dry states, the tensile property of collagen was reduced by 99% under wet conditions. Our results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that PCL/PLGA/\u03b2-TCP membranes have similar levels of biocompatibility and bone regeneration as collagen membranes. In particular, considering that GBR is always applied to a wet environment (e.g. blood, saliva), we demonstrated that PCL/PLGA/\u03b2-TCP membranes maintained their form more reliably than collagen membranes in a wet setting, confirming their appropriateness as a GBR membrane.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2016-10-08", "authors": ["J-YWon", "C-YPark", "J-HBae", "GAhn", "CKim", "D-HLim", "D-WCho", "W-SYun", "J-HShim", "J-BHuh"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-6041/11/5/055013"}

This strategy enables control of ion release kinetics within an aqueous polymer solution and thus control over gelation kinetics across a wide range of pH.

The results in the solvent-based system showed near first-order kinetics on copper and photoinitiator concentrations up to a threshold value in which the kinetics switch to zeroth-order. This kinetic shift shows that the photo-CuAAC reaction is not susceptible from side reactions such as copper disproportionation, copper(i) reduction, and radical termination at the early stages of the reaction. The overall reaction rate and conversion is highly dependent on the initial concentrations of photoinitiator and copper(ii) as well as their relative ratios. The conversion was decreased when an excess of photoinitiator was utilized compared to its threshold value. Interestingly, the reaction showed an induction period at relatively low intensities. The induction period is decreased by increasing light intensity and photoinitiator concentration. The reaction trends and limitations were further observed in a solventless polymer network forming system, exhibiting a similar copper and photoinitiator threshold behaviour.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2016-10-07", "authors": ["Bassil MEl-Zaatari", "Abhishek UShete", "Brian JAdzima", "Christopher JKloxin"], "doi": "10.1039/c6cp04950h"}

We further embedded the organoids into a specially designed microfluidic perfusion bioreactor to complete the endothelialized-myocardium-on-a-chip platform for cardiovascular toxicity evaluation.

The goal of this work was to establish a protocol for in-vitro imaging of the soft tissues around TKA, usable during throughout the range of motion (ROM).\nThe full size range of a commercially available TKA prosthesis was manufactured by 3D-printing in non-magnetic and non-radiopaque polymer and implanted in 12 cadaveric knees. The relations between these implants and the soft tissues (Popliteus tendon, Medial and Lateral Collateral Ligament, Patellar and Quadriceps tendons) were analyzed, using MRI (5 embalmed specimens) and CT scans after injection of the tissues with barium-sulfate (3 embalmed and 4 fresh-frozen specimens).\nBoth MRI and CT scans enabled good identification of the soft tissues before TKA implantation. MRI produced minimal loss in signal and contrast, and neither the low temperature nor the embalming fluids compromised image quality. CT scans were more precise after TKA implantation, particularly the borders of the implant and the differentiation of soft tissues. Full ROM investigation, manual segmentation and three-dimensional reconstructions were possible only with the CT scan.\nThe experimental approach described in this study was successful in visualizing the interactions between the soft tissue and the implants before and after TKA and during the full ROM. The coordinate system allows to localize precisely the different anatomic structures and to quantify any change due to prosthetic implantation.", "journal": "Journal of experimental orthopaedics", "date": "2016-10-05", "authors": ["Michel PBonnin", "TomVan Hoof", "ArnoudDe Kok", "MatthiasVerstraete", "CatherineVan der Straeten", "MorenoSaffarini", "JanVictor"], "doi": "10.1186/s40634-016-0061-5\n10.1016/S0883-5403(97)90037-1\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.02.027\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.11.052\n10.1016/S0883-5403(05)80159-7\n10.1016/j.arth.2008.05.020\n10.1016/j.arth.2010.03.015\n10.1007/s00167-013-2443-x\n10.1302/0301-620X.98B1.35692\n10.1016/j.aanat.2011.03.007\n10.1002/jmri.24210\n10.2214/AJR.11.6659\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.06.004\n10.1002/jor.22060\n10.1055/s-0034-1367729\n10.2463/mrms.9.101\n10.1016/j.knee.2007.05.004\n10.2214/AJR.15.15107\n10.2106/JBJS.H.00434\n10.1115/1.4029258\n10.1007/s11999-013-3047-y\n10.1055/s-2006-934216\n10.1055/s-2006-934220\n10.1148/radiographics.20.3.g00ma10699\n10.1186/1472-6920-13-143\n10.2214/AJR.13.10531\n10.1016/S0940-9602(11)80346-8\n10.1016/S0883-5403(05)80160-3\n10.1007/s00167-012-2332-8\n10.1080/174536707100013870\n10.1016/S0883-5403(06)80064-1"}

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of customized STarFix 3D-printed stereotactic platforms to guide laser probe insertion into mesiotemporal and posterior fossa targets. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of 5 patients (12-55 years of age) treated with laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in which STarFix platforms were used for probe insertion. Bone fiducials were implanted in each patient's skull, and subsequent CT scans were used to guide the design of each platform and incorporate desired treatment trajectories. Once generated, the platforms were mounted on the patients' craniums and used to position the laser probe during surgery. Placement of the laser probe and the LITT procedure were monitored with intraoperative MRI. Perioperative and follow-up MRI were performed to identify and monitor changes in target lesions. RESULTS Accurate placement of the laser probe was observed in all cases. For all patients, thermal ablation was accomplished without intraoperative complications. Of the 4 patients with symptomatic lesions, 2 experienced complete resolution of symptoms, and 1 reported improved symptoms compared with baseline.

{"title": "The use of custom 3D printed stereotactic frames for laser interstitial thermal ablation: technical note.", "abstract": "Over the last several years, laser interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) has gained wide acceptance for the treatment of a myriad of cranial lesions. A wide variety of techniques for placement of the laser fiber have been reported with a spectrum of perceived benefits and drawbacks. The authors present the first report of a customized 3D printed stereotactic frame for LITT. Approximately 1 week prior to surgery, 3-4 skull fiducials were placed after each of 5 patients received a local anesthetic as an outpatient. Radiographs with these fiducials were then used to create a trajectory to the lesion that would be treated with LITT. After the plan was completed, software was used to render a customized frame. On the day of surgery, the frame was attached to the implanted skull fiducials and the LITT catheter was placed. This procedure was carried out in 5 consecutive patients. In 2 patients, a needle biopsy was also performed. Intraoperative and postoperative imaging studies confirmed the accurate placement of the LITT catheter and the lesion created. Mean operating room time for all patients was 45 minutes but only 26 minutes when excluding the cases in which a biopsy was performed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the use of a specific system, the STarFix microTargeting system, for use with LITT and brain biopsy. This system offers several advantages including fast operating times, extensive preoperative planning, no need for cranial fixation, and no need for frame or fiducial placement on the day of surgery. The accuracy of the system combined with these advantages may make this a preferred stereotactic method for LITT, especially in centers where LITT is performed in a diagnostic MRI suite.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2016-10-04", "authors": ["Nicholas JBrandmeir", "JamesMcInerney", "Brad EZacharia"], "doi": "10.3171/2016.8.FOCUS16219"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional direct cell bioprinting for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is a relatively new technology where living cells with or without biomaterials are printed layer-by-layer in order to create three-dimensional (3D) living structures. In this article, novel bioprinting methodologies are developed to fabricate 3D biological structures directly from computer models using live multicellular aggregates. Multicellular aggregates made out of at least two cell types from fibroblast, endothelial and smooth muscle cells are prepared and optimized. A novel bioprinting approach is proposed in order to continuously extrude cylindrical multicellular aggregates through the bioprinter's glass microcapillaries. The multicellular aggregates are first aspirated into a capillary and then compressed to form a continuous cylindrical multicellular bioink. To overcome surface tension-driven droplet formation, the required compression ratio is calculated. Based on the developed bioprinting strategies, multicellular aggregates and their support structures are bioprinted to form 3D tissue constructs with predefined shapes. The effect of the bioprinting process was examined for fusion, cell viability at different compression ratios, and f-actin cytoskeletal organization. The results show that the bioprinted 3D constructs fuse rapidly and have high cell viability after printing. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, quaternized chitosan (hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan, HACC) was grafted to 3D-printed scaffolds composed of polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) and hydroxyapatite (HA), in order to design bone engineering scaffolds endowed with antibacterial and osteoconductive properties. We found that both the PLGA/HA/HACC and PLGA/HACC composite scaffolds decreased bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Additionally, ATP leakage assay indicated that immobilizing HACC on the scaffolds could effectively disrupt microbial membranes. Using human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), we demonstrated that HA incorporated scaffolds, including PLGA/HA and PLGA/HA/HACC, favoured cell attachment, proliferation, spreading and osteogenic differentiation compared to HA-free PLGA or PLGA/HACC scaffolds. Finally, an in vivo biocompatibility assay conducted on rats, showed that HA incorporated scaffolds (including PLGA/HA and PLGA/HA/HACC scaffolds) exhibited good neovascularization and tissue integration. Taken together, our findings support the approach for developing porous PLGA/HA/HACC composite scaffold with potential clinical application in the treatment of infected bone.\nAlthough plenty of conductive scaffold biomaterials have been exploited to improve bone regeneration under infection, potential tissue toxicity under high concentration and antibiotic-resistance are their main deficiencies. This study indicated that HACC-grafted PLGA/HA composite scaffold prepared using an innovative 3D-printing technique and covalent grafting strategy showed significantly enhanced antibacterial activities, especially against the antibiotic-resistant strains, together with good osteogenic activity and biocompatibility. Therefore, it provides an effective porous composite scaffold to combat the infected bone defect in clinic with decreased risks of bacterial resistance and open a feasible strategy for the modification of scaffold interfaces involved in the bone regeneration and anti-infection.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-10-01", "authors": ["YingYang", "ShengbingYang", "YugangWang", "ZhifengYu", "HaiyongAo", "HongboZhang", "LingQin", "OlivierGuillaume", "DavidEglin", "R GeoffRichards", "TingtingTang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.035"}

However, the steps involved in the building of 3D models, consisting of image acquisition and selection, segmentation, and printing are highly operator dependent. Current 3D models may be rigid or flexible, but unable to reproduce the physiologic variations during the cardiac cycle. Furthermore, high costs and long average segmentation and printing times (18-24\u00a0h) limit a more extensive use.

{"title": "3D-printed external light trap for solar cells.", "abstract": "We present a universally applicable 3D-printed external light trap for enhanced absorption in solar cells. The\u00a0macroscopic external light trap is placed at the sun-facing surface of the solar cell and retro-reflects the light that would otherwise escape. The light trap consists of a reflective parabolic concentrator placed on top of a reflective cage. Upon placement of the light trap, an improvement of\u00a015% of both the photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency in a thin-film nanocrystalline silicon\u00a0(nc-Si:H) solar cell is measured. The trapped light traverses the solar cell several times within the reflective cage thereby increasing the total absorption in the cell. Consequently, the trap reduces optical losses and enhances the absorption over the entire spectrum. The components of the light trap are 3D printed and made of smoothened, silver-coated thermoplastic. In contrast to conventional light trapping methods, external light trapping leaves the material quality and the electrical properties of the solar cell unaffected. To explain the theoretical operation of the external light trap, we introduce a model that predicts the absorption enhancement in the solar cell by the external light trap. The corresponding calculated path length enhancement shows good agreement with the empirically derived value from the opto-electrical data of the solar cell. Moreover, we analyze the influence of the angle of incidence on the parasitic absorptance to obtain full understanding of the trap performance. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

{"title": "Highly-stretchable 3D-architected Mechanical Metamaterials.", "abstract": "Soft materials featuring both 3D free-form architectures and high stretchability are highly desirable for a number of engineering applications ranging from cushion modulators, soft robots to stretchable electronics; however, both the manufacturing and fundamental mechanics are largely elusive. Here, we overcome the manufacturing difficulties and report a class of mechanical metamaterials that not only features 3D free-form lattice architectures but also poses ultrahigh reversible stretchability (strain\u2009>\u2009414%), 4 times higher than that of the existing counterparts with the similar complexity of 3D architectures. The microarchitected metamaterials, made of highly stretchable elastomers, are realized through an additive manufacturing technique, projection microstereolithography, and its postprocessing. With the fabricated metamaterials, we reveal their exotic mechanical behaviors: Under large-strain tension, their moduli follow a linear scaling relationship with their densities regardless of architecture types, in sharp contrast to the architecture-dependent modulus power-law of the existing engineering materials; under large-strain compression, they present tunable negative-stiffness that enables ultrahigh energy absorption efficiencies. To harness their extraordinary stretchability and microstructures, we demonstrate that the metamaterials open a number of application avenues in lightweight and flexible structure connectors, ultraefficient dampers, 3D meshed rehabilitation structures and stretchable electronics with designed 3D anisotropic conductivity.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-09-27", "authors": ["YanhuiJiang", "QimingWang"], "doi": "10.1038/srep34147"}
{"title": "Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) surface nanomodified 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds for bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a new fabrication method for tissue engineering which can precisely control scaffold architecture at the micron-scale. However, scaffolds not only need 3D biocompatible structures that mimic the micron structure of natural tissues, they also require mimicking of the nano-scale extracellular matrix properties of the tissue they intend to replace. In order to achieve this, the objective of the present in vitro study was to use cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) as a quick and inexpensive way to modify the nano-scale roughness and chemical composition of a 3D printed scaffold surface. Water contact angles of a normal 3D printed poly-lactic-acid (PLA) scaffold dramatically dropped after CAP treatment from 70\u00b12\u00b0 to 24\u00b12\u00b0. In addition, the nano-scale surface roughness (Rq) of the untreated 3D PLA scaffolds drastically increased (up to 250%) after 1, 3, and 5min of CAP treatment from 1.20nm to 10.50nm, 22.90nm, and 27.60nm, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the ratio of oxygen to carbon significantly increased after CAP treatment, which indicated that the CAP treatment of PLA not only changed nano-scale roughness but also chemistry. Both changes in hydrophilicity and nano-scale roughness demonstrated a very efficient plasma treatment, which in turn significantly promoted both osteoblast (bone forming cells) and mesenchymal stem cell attachment and proliferation. These promising results suggest that CAP surface modification may have potential applications for enhancing 3D printed PLA bone tissue engineering materials (and all 3D printed materials) in a quick and an inexpensive manner and, thus, should be further studied.\nThree-dimensional (3D) printing is a new fabrication method for tissue engineering which can precisely control scaffold architecture at the micron-scale. Although their success is related to their ability to exactly mimic the structure of natural tissues and control mechanical properties of scaffolds, 3D printed scaffolds have shortcomings such as limited mimicking of the nanoscale extracellular matrix properties of the tissue they intend to replace. In order to achieve this, the objective of the present in vitro study was to use cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) as a quick and inexpensive way to modify the nanoscale roughness and chemical composition of a 3D printed scaffold surface. The results indicated that using CAP surface modification could achieve a positive change of roughness and surface chemistry. Results showed that both hydrophilicity and nanoscale roughness changes to these scaffolds after CAP treatment played an important role in enhancing bone cell and mesenchymal stem cell attachment and functions. More importantly, this technique could be used for many 3D printed polymer-based biomaterials to improve their properties for numerous applications.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-09-27", "authors": ["MianWang", "PelagieFavi", "XiaoqianCheng", "Negar HGolshan", "Katherine SZiemer", "MichaelKeidar", "Thomas JWebster"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.030"}

{"title": "Fully porous 3D printed titanium femoral stem to reduce stress-shielding following total hip arthroplasty.", "abstract": "Current hip replacement femoral implants are made of fully solid materials which all have stiffness considerably higher than that of bone. This mechanical mismatch can cause significant bone resorption secondary to stress shielding, which can lead to serious complications such as peri-prosthetic fracture during or after revision surgery. In this work, a high strength fully porous material with tunable mechanical properties is introduced for use in hip replacement design. The implant macro geometry is based off of a short stem taper-wedge implant compatible with minimally invasive hip replacement surgery. The implant micro-architecture is fine-tuned to locally mimic bone tissue properties which results in minimum bone resorption secondary to stress shielding. We present a systematic approach for the design of a 3D printed fully porous hip implant that encompasses the whole activity spectrum of implant development, from concept generation, multiscale mechanics of porous materials, material architecture tailoring, to additive manufacturing, and performance assessment via in vitro experiments in composite femurs. We show that the fully porous implant with an optimized material micro-structure can reduce the amount of bone loss secondary to stress shielding by 75% compared to a fully solid implant. This result also agrees with those of the in vitro quasi-physiological experimental model and the corresponding finite element model for both the optimized fully porous and fully solid implant. These studies demonstrate the merit and the potential of tuning material architecture to achieve a substantial reduction of bone resorption secondary to stress shielding. \u00a9 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Research on material for use in additive manufacturing is ongoing, and a wide variety of materials are being used or developed for use in dentistry. Some materials, however, such as cobalt chromium, still lack sufficient research to allow definite conclusions about the suitability of their use in clinical dental practice. Despite this, due to the wide variety of machines that use additive manufacturing, there is much more flexibility in the build material and geometry when building structures compared with subtractive manufacturing. Overall additive manufacturing produces little material waste and is energy efficient when compared to subtractive manufacturing, due to passivity and the additive layering nature of the build process. Such features make the technique suitable to be used with fabricating structures out of hard to handle materials such as cobalt chromium. The main limitations of this technology include the appearance of steps due to layering of material and difficulty in fabricating certain material generally used in dentistry for use in 3D printing such as ceramics.

{"title": "Capacitive Feedthroughs for Medical Implants.", "abstract": "Important technological advances in the last decades paved the road to a great success story for electrically stimulating medical implants, including cochlear implants or implants for deep brain stimulation. However, there are still many challenges in reducing side effects and improving functionality and comfort for the patient. Two of the main challenges are the wish for smaller implants on one hand, and the demand for more stimulation channels on the other hand. But these two aims lead to a conflict of interests. This paper presents a novel design for an electrical feedthrough, the so called capacitive feedthrough, which allows both reducing the size, and increasing the number of included channels. Capacitive feedthroughs combine the functionality of a coupling capacitor and an electrical feedthrough within one and the same structure. The paper also discusses the progress and the challenges of the first produced demonstrators.

{"title": "Bio-Orthogonally Crosslinked, Engineered Protein Hydrogels with Tunable Mechanics and Biochemistry for Cell Encapsulation.", "abstract": "Covalently-crosslinked hydrogels are commonly used as 3D matrices for cell culture and transplantation. However, the crosslinking chemistries used to prepare these gels generally cross-react with functional groups present on the cell surface, potentially leading to cytotoxicity and other undesired effects. Bio-orthogonal chemistries have been developed that do not react with biologically relevant functional groups, thereby preventing these undesirable side reactions. However, previously developed biomaterials using these chemistries still possess less than ideal properties for cell encapsulation, such as slow gelation kinetics and limited tuning of matrix mechanics and biochemistry. Here, engineered elastin-like proteins (ELPs) are developed that cross-link via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) or Staudinger ligation. The SPAAC-crosslinked materials form gels within seconds and complete gelation within minutes. These hydrogels support the encapsulation and phenotypic maintenance of human mesenchymal stem cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and murine neural progenitor cells. SPAAC-ELP gels exhibit independent tuning of stiffness and cell adhesion, with significantly improved cell viability and spreading observed in materials containing a fibronectin-derived arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) domain. The crosslinking chemistry used permits further material functionalization, even in the presence of cells and serum.

{"title": "A computational atlas of normal coronary artery anatomy.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to define the shape variations, including diameters and angles, of the major coronary artery bifurcations.\nComputed tomographic angiograms from 300 adults with a zero calcium score and no stenoses were segmented for centreline and luminal models.

The diameter (mean\u00b1SD) of the left main coronary was 3.5\u00b10.8 mm and the length 10.5\u00b15.3 mm. The left main bifurcation angle (distal angle or angle B) was 89\u00b121\u00b0 for cases with, and 75\u00b123\u00b0 for those without an intermediate artery (p<0.001). Analogous measurements of diameter and angle were tabulated for the other major bifurcations (left anterior descending/diagonal, circumflex/obtuse marginal and right coronary crux).

{"title": "Influence of droplet coverage on the electrochemical response of planar microelectrodes and potential solving strategies based on nesting concept.", "abstract": "Recently, biosensors have been widely used for the detection of bacteria, viruses and other toxins. Electrodes, as commonly used transducers, are a vital part of electrochemical biosensors. The coverage of the droplets can change significantly based on the hydrophobicity of the microelectrode surface materials. In the present research, screen-printed interdigitated microelectrodes (SPIMs), as one type of planar microelectrode, were applied to investigate the influence of droplet coverage on electrochemical response. Furthermore, three dimensional (3D) printing technology was employed to print smart devices with different diameters based on the nesting concept. Theoretical explanations were proposed to elucidate the influence of the droplet coverage on the electrochemical response. 3D-printed ring devices were used to incubate the SPIMs and the analytical performances of the SPIMs were tested. According to the results obtained, our device successfully improved the stability of the signal responses and eliminated irregular signal changes to a large extent. Our proposed method based on the nesting concept provides a promising method for the fabrication of stable electrochemical biosensors.

In this study, a new cell-laden scaffold was developed that supplies micro/nano-topological cues and promotes efficient release of cells. The hierarchical structure consisted of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) macrosized struts for sustaining a three-dimensional structural shape, aligned nanofibers obtained with optimized electrospinning, and cell-printed myoblasts. Importantly, the printed myoblasts were fully safe and were efficiently released from the cell-laden struts to neighboring nanofiber networks. The incorporation of micro/nanofibers in the hierarchical scaffold significantly affected myoblast proliferation, alignment, and even facilitated the formation of myotubes. We observed that myosin heavy chain expression and the expression levels of various myogenic genes (MyoD, myogenin, and troponin T) were significantly affected by the fiber alignment achieved in our hierarchical cell-laden structure.

This technology enables spatial manipulation of cells and biomaterials, also referred to as 'bioink', and thus allows study of cellular interactions in a 3D microenvironment and/or in the formation of functional tissues and organs. Recently, many efforts have been made to develop new bioinks and to apply more cell sources for better biocompatibility and biofunctionality. However, the influences of printing parameters on the shape fidelity of 3D constructs as well as on cell viability after the cell printing process have been poorly characterized. Furthermore, parameter optimization based on a specific cell type might not be suitable for other types of cells, especially cells with high sensibility. In this study, we systematically studied the influence of bioink properties and printing parameters on bioink printability and embryonic stem cell (ESC) viability in the process of extrusion-based cell printing, also known as bioplotting. A novel method was established to determine suitable conditions for bioplotting ESCs to achieve both good printability and high cell viability. The rheological properties of gelatin/alginate bioinks were evaluated to determine the gelation properties under different bioink compositions, printing temperatures and holding times. The bioink printability was characterized by a newly developed semi-quantitative method. The results demonstrated that bioinks with longer gelation times would result in poorer printability. The live/dead assay showed that ESC viability increased with higher printing temperatures and lower gelatin concentrations. Furthermore, an exponential relationship was obtained between ESC viability and induced shear stress. By defining the proper printability and acceptable viability ranges, a combined parameters region was obtained. This study provides guidance for parameter optimization and the fine-tuning of 3D cell printing processes regarding both bioink printability and cell viability after bioplotting, especially for easily damaged cells, like ESCs.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-09-17", "authors": ["LiliangOuyang", "RuiYao", "YuZhao", "WeiSun"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/035020"}

Cefazolin, an antibiotic drug was incorporated in the yarn fibers by addition to the PLLA electrospinning solution. Morphological studies showed that independent of the twist rate, uniform and smooth fibers were formed. The diameter of the electrospun fibers in the yarns decreased at higher twist rates but produced yarns with larger diameters. At increasing twist rates the crystallinity of the fibers in the yarns increased. In the presence of cefazolin the fiber diameter, yarn diameter and crystallinity were always lower than in the non-drug loaded yarns. In addition the yarn mechanical properties revealed a slightly lower strength, modulus and elongation at break upon drug loading. The effect of the twist rate on the cefazolin in vitro release behavior from both PLLA and hybrid yarns revealed similar profiles for both types of drug-loaded yarns. However, the total amount of drug released from the hybrid PLLA/PVA yarns was significantly higher. The release kinetics over a period of 30 d were fitted to different mathematical models. Cefazolin release from electrospun PLLA yarns was governed by a diffusion mechanism and could best be fitted by Peppas and Higuchi models. The models that were found best to describe the drug release mechanism from the hybrid PLLA/PVA yarns were a first-order model and the Higuchi model.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-09-17", "authors": ["HMaleki", "A AGharehaghaji", "TToliyat", "P JDijkstra"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/035019"}

{"title": "Finite Element Model and Validation of Nasal Tip Deformation.", "abstract": "Nasal tip mechanical stability is important for functional and cosmetic nasal airway surgery. Palpation of the nasal tip provides information on tip strength to the surgeon, though it is a purely subjective assessment. Providing a means to simulate nasal tip deformation with a validated model can offer a more objective approach in understanding the mechanics and nuances of the nasal tip support and eventual nasal mechanics as a whole. Herein we present validation of a finite element (FE) model of the nose using physical measurements recorded using an ABS plastic-silicone nasal phantom. Three-dimensional photogrammetry was used to capture the geometry of the phantom at rest and while under steady state load. The silicone used to make the phantom was mechanically tested and characterized using a linear elastic constitutive model. Surface point clouds of the silicone and FE model were compared for both the loaded and unloaded state. The average Hausdorff\u00a0distance between actual measurements and FE simulations across the nose were 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04\u00a0mm and deviated up to 2\u00a0mm at the outermost boundaries of the model. FE simulation and measurements were in near complete agreement in the immediate vicinity of the nasal tip with millimeter accuracy. We have demonstrated validation of a two-component nasal FE model, which could be used to model more complex modes of deformation where direct measurement may be challenging.

{"title": "Patterning cellular compartments within TRACER cultures using sacrificial gelatin printing.", "abstract": "In the past decade, it has been well recognised that the tumour microenvironment contains microenvironmental components such as hypoxia that significantly influence tumour cell behaviours such, invasiveness and therapy resistance, all of which provide new targets for studying cancer biology and developing anticancer therapeutics. In response, a large number of two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) in vitro tumour models have been developed to recapitulate different aspects of the tumour microenvironment and enable the study of related biological questions. While more complex models enable new biological insight, such models often involve time-consuming and complex fabrication or analysis processes, which limit their adoption by the broader cancer biology community. To address this, we recently reported the development of a new platform that enables easy assembly and analysis of 3D tumour cultures, the tissue roll for analysis of cellular environment response (TRACER). The TRACER platform enables recapitulation of many spatial aspects of the tumour microenvironment to ask a variety of questions, however its original design contains only one cell type. In contrast tumours in vivo often contain a neoplastic and stromal compartment. To expand the types of questions the TRACER system is useful for asking, here we present a strategy to pattern distinct cell type domains into TRACER layers using a custom-built gelatin-dispensing pen. The pen allows deposition of a temporary gelatin barrier into the TRACER scaffold to define domain boundaries between cell populations. The gelatin can be melted away after cell seeding to allow interaction of cell populations from adjacent domains.

We first fabricated and characterized well-defined porous PCL-\u03b2-TCP scaffolds with identical pore size (500\u00b5m) but different strut sizes (200 and 400\u00b5m) using additive manufacturing (AM) technology, and then assessed the HUVEC\u05f3s proliferation and morphogenesis within collagen, PCL-\u03b2-TCP scaffold, and the collagen-scaffold hybrid construct. Results showed that, in the hybrid construct, the cell population in the collagen component dropped by day 7 but then increased by day 14. Also, cells migrated onto the struts of the scaffold component, proliferated over time, and formed networks on the thinner struts (i.e., 200\u00b5m). Also, the thinner struts resulted in formation of long linear cellular cords structures within the pores. Finite element simulation demonstrated principal stress patterns similar to the observed cell-network pattern. It is probable that the scaffold component modulated patterns of principal stresses in the collagen component as biomechanical cues for reorganization of cell network patterns. Also, the scaffold component significantly improved the mechanical integrity of hydrogel component in the hybrid construct for weight-bearing applications.

{"title": "Bioprinting and Differentiation of Stem Cells.", "abstract": "The 3D bioprinting of stem cells directly into scaffolds offers great potential for the development of regenerative therapies; in particular for the fabrication of organ and tissue substitutes. For this to be achieved; the lineage fate of bioprinted stem cell must be controllable. Bioprinting can be neutral; allowing culture conditions to trigger differentiation or alternatively; the technique can be designed to be stimulatory. Such factors as the particular bioprinting technique; bioink polymers; polymer cross-linking mechanism; bioink additives; and mechanical properties are considered. In addition; it is discussed that the stimulation of stem cell differentiation by bioprinting may lead to the remodeling and modification of the scaffold over time matching the concept of 4D bioprinting. The ability to tune bioprinting properties as an approach to fabricate stem cell bearing scaffolds and to also harness the benefits of the cells multipotency is of considerable relevance to the field of biomaterials and bioengineering.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-09-13", "authors": ["Scott AIrvine", "Subbu SVenkatraman"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules21091188\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/014103\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1097053\n10.1080/17452759.2013.873337\n10.3390/jfb2030119\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.006\n10.4252/wjsc.v7.i1.37\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.09.016\n10.1002/adma.201302042\n10.1126/science.1226340\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.008\n10.1007/s10544-014-9915-8\n10.1108/13552540910960307\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015003\n10.1002/biot.200900004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.076\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.12.011\n10.1002/btpr.124\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05079.x\n10.1038/nrm3049\n10.2217/17460751.3.6.877\n10.3109/21691401.2015.1129620\n10.1007/s12015-010-9193-7\n10.4252/wjsc.v7.i1.149\n10.5966/sctm.2012-0088\n10.1038/nbt1274\n10.1186/s12967-014-0260-8\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181c6ffbe\n10.1038/cddis.2015.327\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.005\n10.1038/nbt.1554\n10.1002/stem.788\n10.3389/fcell.2015.00002\n10.1007/s10439-014-1207-1\n10.1007/s10529-015-1921-2\n10.1088/1758-5082/3/3/034112\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0158\n10.1089/ten.tec.2011.0060\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015019\n10.1002/term.2058\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0543\n10.1002/jbm.a.30963\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.023\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/044104\n10.1089/ten.tec.2010.0359\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/3/035006\n10.1021/bm801463q\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.06.007\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.10.005\n10.1002/jbm.b.31831\n10.1089/ten.teb.2015.0140\n10.1021/bm049879r\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.06.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.07.002\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.06.034\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.003\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045012\n10.1039/c3bm00012e\n10.1016/j.msec.2006.05.047\n10.1021/bm3011352\n10.1038/srep13427\n10.1002/app.13563\n10.1002/jemt.22417\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.050\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.067\n10.1007/s00253-012-4569-z\n10.1007/s00726-005-0298-2\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00096-6\n10.1080/1539445X.2014.1003270\n10.1007/s12223-013-0287-x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.12.034\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00175-8\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.08.055\n10.1002/jctb.1468\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.037\n10.1089/ten.2007.0093\n10.1016/j.joen.2014.12.002\n10.1002/adhm.201500677\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/044102\n10.1155/2012/346972\n10.3324/haematol.2015.135921\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.01.010\n10.7150/ijbs.2929\n10.1006/bbrc.2001.4898\n10.1002/jbm.a.32589\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2695\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.10.045\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2010.02.014\n10.1038/nbt987\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.001\n10.1089/scd.2011.0040\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.10.016\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.04.014\n10.1002/jbm.a.34171\n10.1007/s10529-015-1975-1\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/3/035020\n10.1002/mabi.201100383\n10.1002/btpr.1825\n10.1007/s11626-013-9717-y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.090\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072610\n10.1038/nrm2319\n10.1038/nbt.2978\n10.1016/j.scr.2010.09.005\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1186/s13287-015-0083-4\n10.1038/nmat2732\n10.1152/ajpcell.67.2008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.04.043\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.065\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.07.016\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.05.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.070\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.09.029\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.11.019\n10.1016/S0142-9612(97)00144-0\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.003\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1097054\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.071\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/4/045007\n10.1093/ejcts/ezu148\n10.1038/nbt.3413\n10.1002/adma.201305506\n10.1073/pnas.0711983105"}
{"title": "Simulation for Percutaneous Renal Access: Where Are We?", "abstract": "Percutaneous renal access (PCA) is a challenging step during percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The aim of this study is to review the literature for different types of simulators described for PCA.\nDatabases of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, OvidSP, and Google Scholar were systematically searched until May 2016. The studies were analyzed regarding the type of simulator (nonbiologic, biologic, live animal, and virtual reality [VR]), type of validity (face, content, construct, and predictive), cost-effectiveness, and whether these simulators have been used for training and/or assessment of PCA. In addition, the study looked at the educational impact of these simulators in terms of the transfer of PCA skills to the operating room.\nSeveral bench, animal, and VR simulators for training in PCA were identified. Only few studies were found on assessment of PCA skills. Biological bench models used porcine or bovine kidneys wrapped within foam, silicone, chicken carcass, or full-thickness skin flap alone. Other biological models used additional subcutaneous fascia, muscle, or ribs. Nonbiological models used prototypes, including 3D printing. Only one study reported the use of anesthetized live pig for training. The PERC Mentor\u2122 was the only VR simulator, which has been validated for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, none of these studies assessed the educational impact of PCA simulators. Furthermore, most of the studies did not address the validity and the cost of the simulator.\nWhile several biological and nonbiological PCA models exist, there is paucity of literature regarding the validity and educational impact of these simulators. The PERC Mentor simulator is the sole validated simulator for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, it is expensive and there is little evidence of its educational impact. Therefore, more research is needed to validate the available simulators and assess their educational impact for urology trainees.", "journal": "Journal of endourology", "date": "2016-09-13", "authors": ["Yasser ANoureldin", "SeroAndonian"], "doi": "10.1089/end.2016.0587"}

{"title": "3D Printed Bionic Nanodevices.", "abstract": "The ability to three-dimensionally interweave biological and functional materials could enable the creation of bionic devices possessing unique and compelling geometries, properties, and functionalities. Indeed, interfacing high performance active devices with biology could impact a variety of fields, including regenerative bioelectronic medicines, smart prosthetics, medical robotics, and human-machine interfaces. Biology, from the molecular scale of DNA and proteins, to the macroscopic scale of tissues and organs, is three-dimensional, often soft and stretchable, and temperature sensitive. This renders most biological platforms incompatible with the fabrication and materials processing methods that have been developed and optimized for functional electronics, which are typically planar, rigid and brittle. A number of strategies have been developed to overcome these dichotomies. One particularly novel approach is the use of extrusion-based multi-material 3D printing, which is an additive manufacturing technology that offers a freeform fabrication strategy. This approach addresses the dichotomies presented above by (1) using 3D printing and imaging for customized, hierarchical, and interwoven device architectures; (2) employing nanotechnology as an enabling route for introducing high performance materials, with the potential for exhibiting properties not found in the bulk; and (3) 3D printing a range of soft and nanoscale materials to enable the integration of a diverse palette of high quality functional nanomaterials with biology. Further, 3D printing is a multi-scale platform, allowing for the incorporation of functional nanoscale inks, the printing of microscale features, and ultimately the creation of macroscale devices. This blending of 3D printing, novel nanomaterial properties, and 'living' platforms may enable next-generation bionic systems. In this review, we highlight this synergistic integration of the unique properties of nanomaterials with the versatility of extrusion-based 3D printing technologies to interweave nanomaterials and fabricate novel bionic devices.", "journal": "Nano today", "date": "2016-09-13", "authors": ["Yong LinKong", "Maneesh KGupta", "Blake NJohnson", "Michael CMcAlpine"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nantod.2016.04.007"}
{"title": "Efficient nonarterialized mouse liver transplantation using 3-dimensional-printed instruments.", "abstract": "Because of the wide availability of genetically modified animals, mouse orthotopic liver transplantation is often preferred over rat liver transplantation. We present a simplified mouse liver transplantation technique and compare transplantation outcomes with versus without hepatic artery anastomosis. Instruments for liver implantation were designed and printed with a 3-dimensional (3D) printer. The suprahepatic vena cava anastomosis was performed with a 10-0 running suture. The vena porta and infrahepatic vena cava were joined on extraluminal cuffs, using the 3D-printed device for spatial alignment and stabilization. The hepatic artery was reconstructed in half of the recipients using intraluminal stents. Liver function tests (3, 7, and 28 days) and histology (7 and 28 days) were assessed after transplantation. We performed 22 consecutive syngeneic C57BL/6 mouse orthotopic liver transplantations. The median portal clamping time was 12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 minutes. The survival rate at 4 weeks was 100% for both arterialized and nonarterialized recipients (n\u2009=\u20097, 4 recipients of each group being killed for early histology at day 7). Liver function tests at 3, 7, and 28 days were similar between arterialized versus nonarterialized groups. Liver parenchyma demonstrated only irrelevant abnormalities in both groups. The proposed device allows for a shorter clamping time compared with the published literature. Using this technique, the artery does not need to be anastomosed, with no impact on graft and recipient outcomes. The device is available for 3D printing.

{"title": "Regulation of Chondrogenesis and Hypertrophy in Silk Fibroin-Gelatin-Based 3D Bioprinted Constructs.", "abstract": "To date, the development of phenotypically stable, functionally equivalent engineered cartilage tissue constructs remains elusive. This study explored chondrogenic differentiation and suppression of hypertrophic differentiation in tyrosinase cross-linked silk-gelatin bioink using different cell modalities (dispersed, aggregates) for chondrocytes and mesenchymal progenitor cells (hMSCs) compared against the \"gold standard\" hMSC spheroids. Chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC spheroids (without silk-gelatin) showed a constant increase in hypertrophy over 21 days (gradual upregulated expression of COL10A1, MMP13). On the contrary, hMSC-laden constructs (both dispersed and aggregates) in bioink showed upregulated hypoxia (HIF1A) which positively regulated the expression of chondrogenic markers (aggrecan, COMP1) over chondrocyte-laden constructs. The gelatin component in the bioink induced MMP2 activity, which degraded the synthesized matrix, creating a pericellular zone for the accumulation of growth factors and newly synthesized matrices. We believe that the combinatorial effect of these accumulated factors as well as the hypoxia-regulated HDAC4 pathway played a pivotal role in stabilizing the chondrogenic phenotype of differentiated hMSCs along with suppressed hypertrophy. Therefore, the results suggest that tyrosinase cross-linked silk-gelatin bioink offers a suitable material composition for 3D bioprinting of cartilage constructs. Further standardization is warranted to investigate the biological mechanisms minimizing hypertrophic differentiation of hMSC/chondrocytes toward development of improved cartilage constructs.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2016-09-12", "authors": ["ShibuChameettachal", "SwatiMidha", "SourabhGhosh"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00152"}

{"title": "Mechanical properties of additively manufactured octagonal honeycombs.", "abstract": "Honeycomb structures have found numerous applications as structural and biomedical materials due to their favourable properties such as low weight, high stiffness, and porosity. Application of additive manufacturing and 3D printing techniques allows for manufacturing of honeycombs with arbitrary shape and wall thickness, opening the way for optimizing the mechanical and physical properties for specific applications. In this study, the mechanical properties of honeycomb structures with a new geometry, called octagonal honeycomb, were investigated using analytical, numerical, and experimental approaches. An additive manufacturing technique, namely fused deposition modelling, was used to fabricate the honeycomb from polylactic acid (PLA). The honeycombs structures were then mechanically tested under compression and the mechanical properties of the structures were determined. In addition, the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories were used for deriving analytical relationships for elastic modulus, yield stress, Poisson's ratio, and buckling stress of this new design of honeycomb structures. Finite element models were also created to analyse the mechanical behaviour of the honeycombs computationally. The analytical solutions obtained using Timoshenko beam theory were close to computational results in terms of elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and yield stress, especially for relative densities smaller than 25%. The analytical solutions based on the Timoshenko analytical solution and the computational results were in good agreement with experimental observations. Finally, the elastic properties of the proposed honeycomb structure were compared to those of other honeycomb structures such as square, triangular, hexagonal, mixed, diamond, and Kagome. The octagonal honeycomb showed yield stress and elastic modulus values very close to those of regular hexagonal honeycombs and lower than the other considered honeycombs.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Factors Influencing the Dimensional Accuracy of 3D-Printed Full-Coverage Dental Restorations Using Stereolithography Technology.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the build angle and the support configuration (thick versus thin support) on the dimensional accuracy of 3D-printed full-coverage dental restorations.\nA full-coverage dental crown was digitally designed and 3D-printed using stereolithography-additive manufacturing (SLA-AM) technology. Nine different angles were used during the build process: 90, 120, 135, 150, 180, 210, 225, 240, and 270 degrees. In each angle, the crown was printed using a thin and a thick support type, resulting in 18 specimens. The specimens were digitally scanned using a high resolution optical surface scanner (IScan D104i; Imetric 3D). The dimensional accuracy was evaluated by digital subtraction technique. The 3D digital files of the scanned printed crowns (test model), exported in standard tessellation language (STL) format, were superimposed with the STL file of the designed crown (reference model) using Geomagic Studio 2014 (3D Systems).\nThe root mean square estimate value and color map results suggest that the build angle and support structure configuration have an influence on the dimensional accuracy of 3D-printed crown restorations. Among the tested angles, the 120-degree build angle showed a minimal deviation of 0.029 mm for thin support and 0.031 mm for thick support, indicating an accurate fit between the test and reference models. Furthermore, the deviation pattern observed in the color map was homogenously distributed and located further away from the critical marginal area.\nWithin the limitations of this study, the selection of build angle should offer the crown the highest dimensional accuracy and self-supported geometry. This allows for the smallest necessary support surface area and decreases the time needed for finishing and polishing. These properties were mostly observed with a build angle of 120 degrees combined with a thin support type.", "journal": "The International journal of prosthodontics", "date": "2016-09-10", "authors": ["NawalAlharbi", "Reham BOsman", "DanielWismeijer"], "doi": "10.11607/ijp.4835"}
{"title": "3D Printing of Cantilever-Type Microstructures by Stereolithography of Ferromagnetic Photopolymers.", "abstract": "In the present work, prototypes of polymeric cantilever-based magnetic microstructures were fabricated by means of stereolithography (SL). To this end, a UV-curable system suitable for high-resolution SL-processing was formulated by blending a bifunctional acrylic monomer with photoinitiator and visible dye whose content was tuned to tailor resin SL sensitivity. Subsequently, to confer ferromagnetic properties to the photopolymer, two different strategies were implemented. A two-step approach involved selective deposition of a metal layer on photopolymer SL-cured surfaces through an electroless plating process. On the other hand, SL-processable ferromagnetically responsive nanocomposites (FRCs) were obtained by directly loading magnetite nanoparticles within the photopolymer matrix. In order to achieve high-printing resolution, resin SL sensitivities were studied as a function of the various additives contents. Photocalorimetric analyses were also performed to investigate the photopolymer conversion efficiency upon light exposure. High-performing formulations were characterized by reduced penetration depth (<50 \u03bcm) and small critical energies thus enabling for fast printing of micrometric structures. Finally, the self-standing characteristics of the resin combined with the layered-fashion deposition typical of the 3D printing technologies were exploited for the fabrication of cantilever (CL)-based beams presented as possible magnetic sensors. As a demonstration of the feasibility of the two approaches, the magnetic beams were successfully actuated and their sensing performances in terms of static deflection vs applied magnetic field applied were qualitatively studied. Being not restricted to CL-based geometries, the combination of SL-printing with the formulation of novel smart photopolymers open the way toward the fabrication of high-customized complex 3D models integrating functional microstructures.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-09-10", "authors": ["CaterinaCredi", "AlessandroFiorese", "MarcoTironi", "RobertoBernasconi", "LucaMagagnin", "MarinellaLevi", "StefanoTurri"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b08880"}

{"title": "A Versatile Method for Fabricating Tissue Engineering Scaffolds with a Three-Dimensional Channel for Prevasculature Networks.", "abstract": "Despite considerable advances in tissue engineering over the past two decades, solutions to some crucial problems remain elusive. Vascularization is one of the most important factors that greatly influence the function of scaffolds. Many research studies have focused on the construction of a vascular-like network with prevascularization structure. Sacrificial materials are widely used to build perfusable vascular-like architectures, but most of these fabricated scaffolds only have a 2D plane-connected network. The fabrication of three-dimensional perfusable branched networks remains an urgent issue. In this work, we developed a novel sacrificial molding technique for fabricating biocompatible scaffolds with a three-dimensional perfusable branched network. Here, 3D-printed poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) filament was used as the sacrificial material. The fused PVA was deposited on the surface of a cylinder to create the 3D branched solid network. Gelatin was used to embed the solid network. Then, the PVA mold was dissolved after curing the hydrogel. The obtained architecture shows good perfusability. Cell experiment results indicated that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) successfully attached to the surface of the branched channel and maintained high viability after a few days in culture. In order to prevent deformation of the channel, paraffin was coated on the surface of the printed structure, and hydroxyapatite (HA) was added to gelatin. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel strategy toward the engineering of prevasculature thick tissues through the integration of the fused PVA filament deposit. This approach has great potential in solving the issue of three-dimensional perfusable branched networks and opens the way to clinical applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-09-09", "authors": ["ShuaiLi", "Yuan-YuanLiu", "Li-JunLiu", "Qing-XiHu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b07725"}

The objective of this study is to use FDM-based 3D bioprinting and nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite for improved bone marrow human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) adhesion, growth, and osteochondral differentiation. FDM printing parameters can be tuned through computer aided design and computer numerical control software to manipulate scaffold geometries in ways that are beneficial to mechanical performance without hindering cellular behavior. Additionally, the ability to fine-tune 3D printed scaffolds increases further through our investment casting procedure which facilitates the inclusion of nanoparticles with biochemical factors to further elicit desired hMSC differentiation. For this study, FDM was used to print investment-casting molds innovatively designed with varied pore distribution over the full thickness of the scaffold. The mechanical and biological impacts of the varied pore distributions were compared and evaluated to determine the benefits of this physical manipulation. The results indicate that both mechanical properties and cell performance improve in the graded pore structures when compared to homogeneously distributed porous and non-porous structures.

It serves as the first line of defence to any external stimuli, hence it is the most vulnerable to injury and warrants the need for rapid and reliable regeneration methods. Tissue engineered skin substitutes help overcome the limitations of traditional skin treatment methods, in terms of technology, time, and cost. While there is commendable progress in the treating of superficial wounds and injuries with skin substitutes, treatment of full-thickness injuries, especially with third or fourth degree burns, still looks murkier. Engineering multi-layer skin architecture, conforming to the native skin structure is a tougher goal to achieve with the current tissue engineering methods, if not impossible, restoring all the functions of the native skin. The testing of drugs and cosmetics is another area, where engineered skins are very much needed, with bans being imposed on product testing on animals.

Latency to detection and lack of early, systematically detectable biomarkers make it difficult to characterize the dynamic and complex intercellular interactions that occur during progressive liver injury. Here, we demonstrate the utility of bioprinted tissue constructs comprising primary hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and endothelial cells to model methotrexate- and thioacetamide-induced liver injury leading to fibrosis. Repeated, low-concentration exposure to these compounds enabled the detection and differentiation of multiple modes of liver injury, including hepatocellular damage, and progressive fibrogenesis characterized by the deposition and accumulation of fibrillar collagens in patterns analogous to those described in clinical samples obtained from patients with fibrotic liver injury. Transient cytokine production and upregulation of fibrosis-associated genes ACTA2 and COL1A1 mimics hallmark features of a classic wound-healing response. A surge in proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2) during the early culture time period is followed by concentration- and treatment-dependent alterations in immunomodulatory and chemotactic cytokines such as IL-13, IL-6, and MCP-1.

Degradation rate and compressive strength of the PLA bolt were measured after immersion in a buffer solution for 3 months. In vitro biochemical characteristics and the nanofibrous matrix were assessed using a water contact angle analyzer, pH meter, and tetrazolium reduction assay. In vivo efficacies of PLGA/collagen nanofibers and PLA bolts for tendon-bone healing were investigated on a rabbit bone tunnel model with histological and tendon pullout tests. The PLGA/collagen-blended nanofibrous membrane was a hydrophilic, stable, and biocompatible scaffold. The PLA bolt was durable for tendon-bone anchoring. Histology showed adequate biocompatibility of the PLA bolt on a medial cortex with progressive bone ingrowth and without tissue overreaction. PLGA nanofibers within the bone tunnel also decreased the tunnel enlargement phenomenon and enhanced tendon-bone integration.

The uniqueness of the present study was to combine low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) and advanced 3D printing techniques to synergistically improve growth and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Specifically, polyethylene glycol diacrylate bioinks containing cell adhesive Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serene (RGDS) peptide and/or nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nHA) were used to fabricate 3D scaffolds with different geometric patterns via novel table-top stereolithography 3D printer. The resultant scaffolds provide a highly porous and interconnected 3D environment to support cell proliferation. Scaffolds with small square pores were determined to be the optimal geometric pattern for MSC attachment and growth. The optimal LIPUS working parameters were determined to be 1.5\u2009MHz, 20% duty cycle with 150\u2009mW/cm(2) intensity. Results demonstrated that RGDS peptide and nHA containing 3D printed scaffolds under LIPUS treatment can greatly promote MSC proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium deposition and total protein content.

{"title": "An investigation into the use of polymer blends to improve the printability of and regulate drug release from pharmaceutical solid dispersions prepared via fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing.", "abstract": "FDM 3D printing has been recently attracted increasing research efforts towards the production of personalized solid oral formulations. However, commercially available FDM printers are extremely limited with regards to the materials that can be processed to few types of thermoplastic polymers, which often may not be pharmaceutically approved materials nor ideal for optimizing dosage form performance of poor soluble compounds. This study explored the use of polymer blends as a formulation strategy to overcome this processability issue and to provide adjustable drug release rates from the printed dispersions. Solid dispersions of felodipine, the model drug, were successfully fabricated using FDM 3D printing with polymer blends of PEG, PEO and Tween 80 with either Eudragit E PO or Soluplus. As PVA is one of most widely used polymers in FDM 3D printing, a PVA based solid dispersion was used as a benchmark to compare the polymer blend systems to in terms of processability. The polymer blends exhibited excellent printability and were suitable for processing using a commercially available FDM 3D printer. With 10% drug loading, all characterization data indicated that the model drug was molecularly dispersed in the matrices. During in vitro dissolution testing, it was clear that the disintegration behavior of the formulations significantly influenced the rates of drug release. Eudragit EPO based blend dispersions showed bulk disintegration; whereas the Soluplus based blends showed the 'peeling' style disintegration of strip-by-strip. The results indicated that interplay of the miscibility between excipients in the blends, the solubility of the materials in the dissolution media and the degree of fusion between the printed strips during FDM process can be used to manipulate the drug release rate of the dispersions. This brings new insight into the design principles of controlled release formulations using FDM 3D printing.", "journal": "European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V", "date": "2016-09-07", "authors": ["MuqdadAlhijjaj", "PeterBelton", "ShengQi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejpb.2016.08.016"}

Dose distributions were compared to those obtained with a commercial superficial applicator.\nMeasured printing accuracy was within 0.5mm. Dose attenuation was not sensitive to the density of the material. Surface dose distribution comparison of the 3D printed flat applicators with respect to the commercial superficial applicator showed an overall passing rate greater than 94% for gamma analysis with 3% dose difference criteria, 3mm distance-to-agreement criteria and 10% dose threshold.\nLow-cost 3D printers are a promising solution for the customization of the HDR brachytherapy applicators.

{"title": "The role of water on the structure and mechanical properties of a thermoplastic natural block co-polymer from squid sucker ring teeth.", "abstract": "Hard biological polymers exhibiting a truly thermoplastic behavior that can maintain their structural properties after processing are extremely rare and highly desirable for use in advanced technological applications such as 3D-printing, biodegradable plastics and robust composites. One exception are the thermoplastic proteins that comprise the sucker ring teeth (SRT) of the Humboldt jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas). In this work, we explore the mechanical properties of reconstituted SRT proteins and demonstrate that the material can be re-shaped by simple processing in water and at relatively low temperature (below 100 \u00b0C). The post-processed material maintains a high modulus in the GPa range, both in the dry and the wet states. When transitioning from low to high humidity, the material properties change from brittle to ductile with an increase in plastic deformation, where water acts as a plasticizer. Using synchrotron x-ray scattering tools, we found that water mostly influences nano scale structure, whereas at the molecular level, the protein structure remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, through simultaneous in situ x-ray scattering and mechanical tests, we show that the supramolecular network of the reconstituted SRT material exhibits a progressive alignment along the strain direction, which is attributed to chain alignment of the amorphous domains of SRT proteins. The high modulus in both dry and wet states, combined with their efficient thermal processing characteristics, make the SRT proteins promising substitutes for applications traditionally reserved for petroleum-based thermoplastics.", "journal": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "date": "2016-09-03", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mentRieu", "LucaBertinetti", "RomanSchuetz", "Cesar CaSalinas-Zavala", "James CWeaver", "PeterFratzl", "AliMiserez", "AdmirMasic"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-3190/11/5/055003"}

The goal of this work was to create a task-configurable fillable phantom for realistic measurements of detectability in PET imaging. Design goals included simplicity, adjustable feature size, realistic size and contrast levels, and inclusion of a lumpy (i.e., heterogeneous) background.\nThe detection targets were hollow 3D-printed dodecahedral nylon features. The exostructure sphere-like features created voids in a background of small, solid non-porous plastic (acrylic) spheres inside a fillable tank. The features filled at full concentration while the background concentration was reduced due to filling only between the solid spheres.\nMultiple iterations of feature size and phantom construction were used to determine a configuration at the limit of detectability for a PET/CT system. A full-scale design used a 20 cm uniform cylinder (head-size) filled with a fixed pattern of features at a contrast of approximately 3:1. Known signal-present and signal-absent PET sub-images were extracted from multiple scans of the same phantom and with detectability in a challenging (i.e., useful) range. These images enabled calculation and comparison of the quantitative observer detectability metrics between scanner designs and image reconstruction methods. The phantom design has several advantages including filling simplicity, wall-less contrast features, the control of the detectability range via feature size, and a clinically realistic lumpy background.\nThis phantom provides a practical method for testing and comparison of lesion detectability as a function of imaging system, acquisition parameters, and image reconstruction methods and parameters.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2016-09-03", "authors": ["Scott DWollenweber", "Adam MAlessio", "Paul EKinahan"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4960365"}

The attenuation of the printed polylactide (PLA), measured by means of the Hounsfield unit on CT scanning, was set to match that of the brain by adjusting the proportion of plastic filament and air (fill ratio). Transmission measurements were made to verify the attenuation of the printed slabs. The radionuclide distribution within the phantom was created by adding (99m)Tc pertechnetate to the ink cartridge of a paper printer and printing images of gray and white matter anatomy, segmented from the same MRI data. The complete subresolution sandwich phantom was assembled from alternate 3D printed slabs and radioactive paper sheets, and then imaged on a dual headed gamma camera to simulate an HMPAO SPECT scan.\nReconstructions of phantom scans successfully used automated ellipse fitting to apply attenuation correction. This removed the variability inherent in manual application of attenuation correction and registration inherent in existing cylindrical phantom designs. The resulting images were assessed visually and by count profiles and found to be similar to those from an existing elliptical PMMA phantom.\nThe authors have demonstrated the ability to create physically realistic HMPAO SPECT simulations using a novel head-shaped 3D printed subresolution sandwich method phantom.

This manuscript describes a rod-based approach that combined both 3D-printing and a modified soft lithography technique to fabricate the soft pneumatic gripper. In brief, the pneumatic featureless mold with chamber component is 3D-printed and the rods were used to create the pneumatic channels that connect to the chamber. This protocol eliminates the risk of channels occluding during the sealing process and the need for external air source or related control circuit. The soft gripper consists of a chamber filled with air, and one or more gripper arms with a pneumatic channel in each arm connected to the chamber. The pneumatic channel is positioned close to the outer wall to create different stiffness in the gripper arm. Upon compression of the chamber which generates pressure on the pneumatic channel, the gripper arm will bend inward to form a close grip posture because the outer wall area is more compliant. The soft gripper can be inserted into a 3D-printed handling tool with two different control modes for chamber compression: manual gripper mode with a movable piston, and robotic gripper mode with a linear actuator. The double-arm gripper with two actuatable arms was able to pick up objects of sizes up to 2 mm and yet generate lower compressive forces as compared to elastomer-coated and non-coated rigid grippers. The feasibility of having other designs, such as single-arm or hook gripper, was also demonstrated, which further highlighted the customizability of the soft gripper device, and it's potential to be used in delicate surgical manipulation to reduce the risk of tissue grip damage.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2016-09-02", "authors": ["Jin-HuatLow", "Chen-HuaYeow"], "doi": "10.3791/54175"}

Since the introduction of Tissue Engineering in 1993, functional biomaterials, stem cells, tunable microenvironments, and high-resolution imaging technologies have significantly advanced efforts to regenerate in vitro culture or tissue platforms. Relatively simple flat or tubular organs are already in (pre)clinical trials and a few commercial products are in market. The road to more complex, high demand, solid organs including heart, kidney and lung will require substantive technical advancement. Here, we consider two emerging technologies for solid organ fabrication. One is decellularization of cadaveric organs followed by repopulation with terminally differentiated or progenitor cells.

One of the obstacles is the bioinks used to deliver cells. Hydrogels are the most widely used bioink materials; however, they aremechanically weak in nature and cannot meet the requirements for supporting structures, especially when the tissues, such as cartilage, require extracellular matrix to be mechanically strong. Secondly and more importantly, tissue regeneration is not only about building all the components in a way that mimics the structures of living tissues, but also about how to make the constructs function normally in the long term. One of the key issues is sufficient nutrient and oxygen supply to the engineered living constructs. The other is to coordinate the interplays between cells, bioactive agents and extracellular matrix in a natural way.

Some indicative applications include water purification systems and energy harvesting. The use of solution, water-based inks for the direct writing of TiO2 on flexible substrates is of paramount importance since it enables low-cost and low-energy intensive large-area manufacturing, compatible with roll-to-roll processing. In this work we study the effect of crystalline TiO2 and polymer addition on the rheological and direct writing properties of Ti-organic/TiO2 inks. We also report on the bridging crystallite formation from the Ti-organic precursor into the TiO2 crystalline phase, under ultraviolet (UV) exposure or mild heat treatments up to 150 \u00b0C. Such crystallite formation is found to be enhanced by polymers with strong polarity and pK\u03b1 such as polyacrylic acid (PAA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) coupled with Raman and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy are used to investigate the crystalline-phase transformation dependence based on the initial TiO2 crystalline-phase concentration and polymer addition. Transmission electron microscopy imaging and selected area electron diffraction patterns confirm the crystalline nature of such bridging printed structures. The obtained inks are patterned on flexible substrates using nozzle-based robotic deposition, a lithography-free, additive manufacturing technique that allows the direct writing of material in specific, digitally predefined, substrate locations.

{"title": "Retrospective 4D MR image construction from free-breathing slice Acquisitions: A novel graph-based approach.", "abstract": "Dynamic or 4D imaging of the thorax has many applications. Both prospective and retrospective respiratory gating and tracking techniques have been developed for 4D imaging via CT and MRI. For pediatric imaging, due to radiation concerns, MRI becomes the de facto modality of choice. In thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS), patients often suffer from extreme malformations of the chest wall, diaphragm, and/or spine with inability of the thorax to support normal respiration or lung growth (Campbell et\u00a0al., 2003, Campbell and Smith, 2007), as such patient cooperation needed by some of the gating and tracking techniques are difficult to realize without causing patient discomfort and interference with the breathing mechanism itself. Therefore (ventilator-supported) free-breathing MRI acquisition is currently the best choice for imaging these patients. This, however, raises a question of how to create a consistent 4D image from such acquisitions. This paper presents a novel graph-based technique for compiling the best 4D image volume representing the thorax over one respiratory cycle from slice images acquired during unencumbered natural tidal-breathing of pediatric TIS patients.\nIn our approach, for each coronal (or sagittal) slice position, images are acquired at a rate of about 200-300ms/slice over several natural breathing cycles which yields over 2000 slices. A weighted graph is formed where each acquired slice constitutes a node and the weight of the arc between two nodes defines the degree of contiguity in space and time of the two slices. For each respiratory phase, an optimal 3D spatial image is constructed by finding the best path in the graph in the spatial direction. The set of all such 3D images for a given respiratory cycle constitutes a 4D image. Subsequently, the best 4D image among all such constructed images is found over all imaged respiratory cycles. Two types of evaluation studies are carried out to understand the behavior of this algorithm and in comparison to a method called Random Stacking - a 4D phantom study and 10 4D MRI acquisitions from TIS patients and normal subjects. The 4D phantom was constructed by 3D printing the pleural spaces of an adult thorax, which were segmented in a breath-held MRI acquisition.\nQualitative visual inspection via cine display of the slices in space and time and in 3D rendered form showed smooth variation for all data sets constructed by the proposed method. Quantitative evaluation was carried out to measure spatial and temporal contiguity of the slices via segmented pleural spaces. The optimal method showed smooth variation of the pleural space as compared to Random Stacking whose behavior was erratic. The volumes of the pleural spaces at the respiratory phase corresponding to end inspiration and end expiration were compared to volumes obtained from breath-hold acquisitions at roughly the same phase. The mean difference was found to be roughly 3%.\nThe proposed method is purely image-based and post-hoc and does not need breath holding or external surrogates or instruments to record respiratory motion or tidal volume. This is important and practically warranted for pediatric patients. The constructed 4D images portray spatial and temporal smoothness that should be expected in a consistent 4D volume. We believe that the method can be routinely used for thoracic 4D imaging.", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "date": "2016-08-29", "authors": ["YubingTong", "Jayaram KUdupa", "Krzysztof CCiesielski", "CaiyunWu", "Joseph MMcDonough", "David AMong", "Robert MCampbell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2016.08.001\n10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563024\n10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587740"}

HELLP syndrome, in particular, can be difficult to diagnose. Recent work suggests that elevated levels of free cell hemoglobin in blood plasma can, as early as the first trimester, potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker for impending complications. We therefore developed a point-of-care mobile phone-based platform that can quickly characterize a patient's level of hemolysis by measuring the color of blood plasma. The custom hardware and software are designed to be easy to use. A sample of the whole blood (~10\u00b5L or less) is first collected into a clear capillary tube or microtube, which is then inserted into a low-cost 3D-printed sample holder attached to the phone. A 5-10min period of quiescence allows for gravitational sedimentation of the red blood cells, leaving a layer of yellowish plasma at the top of the tube. The phone camera then photographs the capillary tube and analyzes the color components of the cell-free plasma layer. The software converts these color values to a concentration of free hemoglobin, based on a built-in calibration curve, and reports the patient's hemolysis level: non-hemolyzed, slightly hemolyzed, mildly hemolyzed, frankly hemolyzed, or grossly hemolyzed..

To achieve high-quality printing with continuous ink flow through a confined nozzle geometry, that is, without agglomeration and nozzle clogging, we design a polyvinylpyrrolidone-wrapped MWNT ink with uniform dispersion and appropriate rheological properties.

Additionally, the restoration and regeneration of some specific body tissues and organs rely on the function of conductive polymers, which can provide electrical cues for cells. In this study, we fabricated three-dimensional composite nanofibre macrostructures of polycaprolactone (PCL) with different concentrations of polyaniline (PANi) by employing an improved electrospinning technology with a specially designed collector. The 3D structures possessed cap-like macrostructures with centimetre-scale thickness and interconnected pore nanotextures with nanometre-scale nanofibres. To estimate the biocompatibility of the 3D PCL/PANi composite nanofibre macrostructures, mouse myoblasts (C2C12 cells) were cultured as model cells. The initial responses of C2C12 cells to the 3D PCL/PANi composite macrostructures were significantly superior to those to pure PCL, that is, the cells exhibited typical myoblast-like morphologies with obvious pseudopodia and the moderate incorporation (less than 2.0 wt%) of conductive PANi facilitated cell proliferation, which indicated that PANi has appreciable cell affinity. Moreover, the addition of conductive PANi to the 3D composite nanofibre macrostructures considerably enhanced myoblast differentiation and myotube maturation.

{"title": "Organic Electronics: An El Dorado in the Quest of New Photocatalysts for Polymerization Reactions.", "abstract": "Photoinitiated polymerization has been the subject of continued research efforts due to the numerous applications in which this polymerization technique is involved (coatings, inks, adhesives, optoelectronic, laser imaging, stereolithography, nanotechnology, etc.). More recently, photopolymerization has received renewed interest due to the emergence of 3D-printing technologies. However, despite current academic and industrial interest in photopolymerization methodologies, a major limitation lies in the slow rates of photopolymerization. The development of new photoinitiating systems aimed at addressing this limitation is an active area of research. Photopolymerization occurs through the exposure of a curable formulation to light, generating radical and/or cationic species to initiate polymerization. At present, photopolymerization is facing numerous challenges related to safety, economic and ecological concerns. Furthermore, practical considerations such as the curing depth and the competition for light absorption between the chromophores and other species in the formulation are key parameters drastically affecting the photopolymerization process. To address these issues, photoinitiating systems operating under low intensity visible light irradiation, in the absence of solvents are highly sought after. In this context, the use of photoredox catalysis can be highly advantageous; that is, photoredox catalysts can provide high reactivities with low catalyst loading, permitting access to high performance photoinitiating systems. However, to act as efficient photoredox catalysts, specific criteria have to be fulfilled. A strong absorption over the visible range, an ability to easily oxidize or reduce as well as sufficient photochemical stability are basic prerequisites to make these molecules desirable candidates for photoredox catalysis. Considering the similarity of requirements between organic electronics and photopolymerization, numerous materials initially designed for applications in organic electronics have been revisited in the context of photopolymerization. Organic electronics is a branch of electronics and materials science focusing on the development of semiconductors devoted to three main research fields; organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). The contribution of organic electronics to the field of electronics is important as it paves the way toward cheaper, lighter, and more energy efficient devices. In the present context of photopolymerization, materials that were investigated as photocatalysts were indifferently organic semiconductors used for transistors, charge-transport materials, and light-emitting materials used in electroluminescent devices or conjugated polymers and small molecule dyes for solar cells. In this Account, we summarize our latest developments in elaborating on photocatalytic systems based on these new classes of compounds. Through an in-depth understanding of the parameters governing their reactivities and our efforts to incorporate these materials into photoinitiating systems, we provide new knowledge and a valuable insight for future prospects.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2016-08-26", "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricDumur", "DidierGigmes", "Jean-PierreFouassier", "JacquesLalev\u00e9e"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00227"}

Yet, despite recent advances, soft robots must still be tethered to hard robotic control systems and power sources. New strategies for creating completely soft robots, including soft analogues of these crucial components, are needed to realize their full potential. Here we report the untethered operation of a robot composed solely of soft materials. The robot is controlled with microfluidic logic that autonomously regulates fluid flow and, hence, catalytic decomposition of an on-board monopropellant fuel supply. Gas generated from the fuel decomposition inflates fluidic networks downstream of the reaction sites, resulting in actuation. The body and microfluidic logic of the robot are fabricated using moulding and soft lithography, respectively, and the pneumatic actuator networks, on-board fuel reservoirs and catalytic reaction chambers needed for movement are patterned within the body via a multi-material, embedded 3D printing technique. The fluidic and elastomeric architectures required for function span several orders of magnitude from the microscale to the macroscale.

{"title": "Effect of the biodegradation rate controlled by pore structures in magnesium phosphate ceramic scaffolds on bone tissue regeneration in vivo.", "abstract": "Similar to calcium phosphates, magnesium phosphate (MgP) ceramics have been shown to be biocompatible and support favorable conditions for bone cells. Micropores below 25\u03bcm (MgP25), between 25 and 53\u03bcm (MgP53), or no micropores (MgP0) were introduced into MgP scaffolds using different sizes of an NaCl template. The porosities of MgP25 and MgP53 were found to be higher than that of MgP0 because of their micro-sized pores. Both in vitro and in vivo analysis showed that MgP scaffolds with high porosity promoted rapid biodegradation. Implantation of the MgP0, MgP25, and MgP53 scaffolds into rabbit calvarial defects (with 4- and 6-mm diameters) was assessed at two times points (4 and 8weeks), followed by analysis of bone regeneration. The micro-CT and histologic analyses of the 4-mm defect showed that the MgP25 and MgP53 scaffolds were degraded completely at 4weeks with simultaneous bone and marrow-like structure regeneration. For the 6-mm defect, a similar pattern of regeneration was observed. These results indicate that the rate of degradation is associated with bone regeneration. The MgP25 and MgP53 scaffold-implanted bone showed a better lamellar structure and enhanced calcification compared to the MgP0 scaffold because of their porosity and degradation rate. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining indicated that the newly formed bone was undergoing maturation and remodeling. Overall, these data suggest that the pore architecture of MgP ceramic scaffolds greatly influence bone formation and remodeling activities and thus should be considered in the design of new scaffolds for long-term bone tissue regeneration.\nThe pore structural conditions of scaffold, including porosity, pore size, pore morphology, and pore interconnectivity affect cell ingrowth, mechanical properties and biodegradabilities, which are key components of scaffold in bone tissue regeneration. In this study, we designed hierarchical pore structure of the magnesium phosphate (MgP) scaffold by combination of the 3D printing process, self-setting reaction and salt-leaching technique, and first studied the effect of pore structures of bioceramic scaffolds on bone tissue regeneration through both in vitro and in vivo studies (rabbit calvarial model).

{"title": "Direct 3D bioprinting of perfusable vascular constructs using a blend bioink.", "abstract": "Despite the significant technological advancement in tissue engineering, challenges still exist towards the development of complex and fully functional tissue constructs that mimic their natural counterparts. To address these challenges, bioprinting has emerged as an enabling technology to create highly organized three-dimensional (3D) vascular networks within engineered tissue constructs to promote the transport of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products, which can hardly be realized using conventional microfabrication techniques. Here, we report the development of a versatile 3D bioprinting strategy that employs biomimetic biomaterials and an advanced extrusion system to deposit perfusable vascular structures with highly ordered arrangements in a single-step process. In particular, a specially designed cell-responsive bioink consisting of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), sodium alginate, and 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol)-tetra-acrylate (PEGTA) was used in combination with a multilayered coaxial extrusion system to achieve direct 3D bioprinting. This blend bioink could be first ionically crosslinked by calcium ions followed by covalent photocrosslinking of GelMA and PEGTA to form stable constructs. The rheological properties of the bioink and the mechanical strengths of the resulting constructs were tuned by the introduction of PEGTA, which facilitated the precise deposition of complex multilayered 3D perfusable hollow tubes. This blend bioink also displayed favorable biological characteristics that supported the spreading and proliferation of encapsulated endothelial and stem cells in the bioprinted constructs, leading to the formation of biologically relevant, highly organized, perfusable vessels. These characteristics make this novel 3D bioprinting technique superior to conventional microfabrication or sacrificial templating approaches for fabrication of the perfusable vasculature. We envision that our advanced bioprinting technology and bioink formulation may also have significant potentials in engineering large-scale vascularized tissue constructs towards applications in organ transplantation and repair.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-08-24", "authors": ["WeitaoJia", "P SelcanGungor-Ozkerim", "Yu ShrikeZhang", "KanYue", "KaiZhu", "WanjunLiu", "QingmentPi", "BatzayaByambaa", "Mehmet RemziDokmeci", "Su RyonShin", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.07.038"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional bioprinting of cell-laden constructs with polycaprolactone protective layers for using various thermoplastic polymers.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell-printed constructs have been recognized as promising biological substitutes for tissue/organ regeneration. They provide tailored physical properties and biological cues via multi-material printing process. In particular, hybrid bioprinting, enabling to use biodegradable synthetic polymers as framework, has been an attractive method to support weak hydrogels. The constructs with controlled architecture and high shape fidelity were fabricated through this method, depositing spatial arrangement of multi-cell types into microscale constructs. Among biodegradable synthetic polymers, polycaprolactone (PCL) has been commonly chosen in fabrication of cell-printed constructs because of its low melting temperature of 60 \u00b0C to be dispensed with extrusion-based bioprinting system. However, in addition to PCL, various synthetic polymers have been widely applied for tissue regeneration. These polymers have distinctive characteristics essential for tissue/organ regeneration. Nevertheless, it is difficult to use some polymers, such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polylactic acid (PLA) with 3D bioprinting technology because of their high melting temperature to be dispensed, which can result in thermal damage to the cells in the printed constructs during the fabrication process. We present a novel bioprinting method to use various synthetic polymers in fabrication of cell-printed constructs. PCL was introduced as a protective layer to prevent thermal damage caused by high temperature of polymers during fabrication. Remarkable improvement in cellular activities in the printed constructs with PCL layers was observed compared with the construct without PCL.

{"title": "Differences in time-dependent mechanical properties between extruded and molded hydrogels.", "abstract": "The mechanical properties of hydrogels used in biomaterials and tissue engineering applications are critical determinants of their functionality. Despite the recent rise of additive manufacturing, and specifically extrusion-based bioprinting, as a prominent biofabrication method, comprehensive studies investigating the mechanical behavior of extruded constructs remain lacking. To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the mechanical properties and swelling properties of crosslinked gelatin-based hydrogels prepared by conventional molding techniques or by 3D bioprinting using a BioBots Beta pneumatic extruder. A preliminary characterization of the impact of bioprinting parameters on construct properties revealed that both Young's modulus and optimal extruding pressure increased with polymer content, and that printing resolution increased with both printing speed and nozzle gauge. High viability (>95%) of encapsulated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts confirmed the cytocompatibility of the construct preparation process. Interestingly, the Young's moduli of extruded and molded constructs were not different, but extruded constructs did show increases in both the rate and extent of time-dependent mechanical behavior observed in creep. Despite similar polymer densities, extruded hydrogels showed greater swelling over time compared to molded hydrogels, suggesting that differences in creep behavior derived from differences in microstructure and fluid flow. Because of the crucial roles of time-dependent mechanical properties, fluid flow, and swelling properties on tissue and cell behavior, these findings highlight the need for greater consideration of the effects of the extrusion process on hydrogel properties.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-08-24", "authors": ["NErsumo", "C EWitherel", "K LSpiller"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/035012"}

The known impact of structure on cell function motivates exploration of the influence of intestinal topography on the phenotype of cultured epithelial cells, but the irregular, macro- to submicron-scale features of native intestine are challenging to precisely replicate in cellular growth substrates. Herein, we utilized chemical vapor deposition of Parylene C on decellularized porcine small intestine to create polymeric intestinal replicas containing biomimetic irregular, multi-scale structures. These replicas were used as molds for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) growth substrates with macro to submicron intestinal topographical features. Resultant PDMS replicas exhibit multiscale resolution including macro- to micro-scale folds, crypt and villus structures, and submicron-scale features of the underlying basement membrane. After 10 d of human epithelial colorectal cell culture on PDMS substrates, the inclusion of biomimetic topographical features enhanced alkaline phosphatase expression 2.3-fold compared to flat controls, suggesting biomimetic topography is important in induced epithelial differentiation.

Microfluidic devices, which function with fine machinery of chambers and microsyringes for fluid flow and have small culture areas, are conventionally used for perfusion culture. In contrast, we have developed a self-driven perfusion culture system by using a paper-based double-layered scaffold as the fundamental component. Gelatin microfibers were electrospun onto a paper material to prepare the scaffold system, in which the constant perfusion of the medium and the scaffold for cell adhesion/proliferation were functionally divided into a paper and a gelatin microfiber layer, respectively. By applying both the capillary action and siphon phenomenon of the paper-based scaffold, which bridged two medium chambers at different height levels, a self-driven medium flow was achieved and the flow rate was also stable, constant, and quantitatively controllable. Moreover, the culture area was enlargeable to the cm(2) scale. The endothelial cells cultivated on this system oriented along the medium-flow direction, suggesting that the shear stress caused by medium flow was effectively applied.

In particular, we will highlight recent breakthroughs in pluripotent stem cell biology that have led to the development of autologous renal progenitor cells capable of differentiating to all renal cell types and will discuss how these cells could be combined with appropriate scaffolds to develop a bioengineered kidney.", "journal": "Current transplantation reports", "date": "2016-08-23", "authors": ["BettinaWilm", "RiccardoTamburrini", "GiuseppeOrlando", "PatriciaMurray"], "doi": "10.1007/s40472-016-0107-8\n10.1097/MOT.0000000000000052\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2002.00164.x\n10.1681/ASN.2005020195\n10.1089/scd.2010.0470\n10.1096/fj.05-3942com\n10.1172/JCI20921\n10.1242/dev.02174\n10.1089/ten.tec.2010.0399\n10.1007/978-1-61779-851-1_12\n10.4161/org.7.2.14881\n10.4161/org.22597\n10.1038/ki.2009.482\n10.1371/journal.pone.0062953\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.07.034\n10.1007/s00418-010-0741-7\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62276-6\n10.1152/ajprenal.00184.2011\n10.1681/ASN.2006010089\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.01.010\n10.14814/phy2.12009\n10.1681/ASN.2008070709\n10.1093/ndt/gfr785\n10.1097/MOT.0000000000000173\n10.1097/01.ASN.0000128974.07460.34\n10.1073/pnas.0406878102\n10.1681/ASN.2007020140\n10.1681/ASN.2014070710\n10.1093/ndt/gfr015\n10.1152/ajprenal.00007.2005\n10.1152/ajprenal.00339.2006\n10.3727/096368911X623925\n10.5966/sctm.2013-0186\n10.1152/ajprenal.00098.2008\n10.1155/2015/602597\n10.1681/ASN.2007010044\n10.1093/ndt/gfq603\n10.1186/scrt19\n10.3727/096368912X655019\n10.1016/j.ahj.2014.03.022\n10.1155/2016/3206807\n10.1089/wound.2012.0408\n10.1007/978-1-61737-960-4_8\n10.1111/j.1365-2184.2008.00572.x\n10.1080/08860220902928981\n10.1016/j.diff.2011.11.004\n10.1681/ASN.2005050544\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.136\n10.1681/ASN.2004070584\n10.1681/ASN.2006101078\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1038/nrg2937\n10.1038/nbt.3070\n10.3390/v3040398\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0084881\n10.1038/srep08826\n10.1681/ASN.2013080831\n10.1038/ncomms2378\n10.1038/nbt.3392\n10.1038/nature15695\n10.1038/ncb2872\n10.1038/nprot.2014.182\n10.1038/ncomms9715\n10.1038/nm812\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.00971.x\n10.1038/ki.1990.303\n10.1093/ndt/gfm671\n10.1002/stem.1101\n10.5301/JN.2011.7426\n10.1073/pnas.1507803112\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124743\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60073-7\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e31829c79cf\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62033-4\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61598-6\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0602\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.033\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e31825a02ab\n10.1097/TP.0000000000000811\n10.1681/ASN.2008111196\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.07.023\n10.3389/fbioe.2015.00043\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064134\n10.1089/end.1998.12.45\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0269\n10.1111/ajt.12999\n10.15761/IMM.1000175\n10.1371/journal.pone.0143849\n10.1517/14712598.2015.993376\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68438-9\n10.1517/14712590903563352\n10.1111/aor.12310\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0110\n10.1681/ASN.2009101043\n10.1098/rstb.2014.0375\n10.1155/2014/398069\n10.1038/516016a"}

Image data of skull bone, brain tissue and tumors, cerebral arteries and aneurysms, and functional regions and relative neural tracts of the brain were extracted from thin slice scan (slice thickness 0.5 mm) of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, slice thickness 1mm), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, respectively. MIMICS software was applied to reconstruct colored virtual models by identifying and differentiating tissues according to their gray scales. Then the colored virtual models were submitted to 3D printer which produced life-sized craniocerebral models for surgical planning and surgical simulation.\n3D printing craniocerebral models allowed neurosurgeons to perform complex procedures in specific clinical cases though detailed surgical planning. It offered great convenience for evaluating the size of spatial fissure of sellar region before surgery, which helped to optimize surgical approach planning. These 3D models also provided detailed information about the location of aneurysms and their parent arteries, which helped surgeons to choose appropriate aneurismal clips, as well as perform surgical simulation. The models further gave clear indications of depth and extent of tumors and their relationship to eloquent cortical areas and adjacent neural tracts, which were able to avoid surgical damaging of important neural structures.\nAs a novel and promising technique, the application of 3D printing craniocerebral models could improve the surgical planning by converting virtual visualization into real life-sized models.It also contributes to functional anatomy study.", "journal": "Zhonghua yi xue za zhi", "date": "2016-08-23", "authors": ["QLan", "A LChen", "TZhang", "QZhu", "TXu"], "doi": "10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2016.30.015"}

{"title": "Nanotechnology Treatment Options for Osteoporosis and Its Corresponding Consequences.", "abstract": "Unfortunately, osteoporosis, as a worldwide disease, is challenging human health with treatment only available for the symptoms of osteoporosis without managing the disease itself. Osteoporosis can be linked as the common cause of fractures and increased mortality among post-menopausal women, men, and the elderly. Regrettably, due to osteoporosis, incidents of fractures are more frequent among the presented populations and can be afflictive for carrying out everyday life activities. Current treatments of osteoporosis encompass changing lifestyles, taking orthopedic drugs, and invasive surgeries. However, these treatment options are not long lasting and can lead to complications after post-surgical life. Therefore, to solve this impairment, researchers have turned to nanotechnologies and nanomaterials to create innovative and alternative treatments associated with the consequences of osteoporosis. This review article provides an introduction to osteoporotic compression vertebral fractures (OVCFs) and current clinical treatments, along with the rationale and efficacy of utilizing nanomaterials to modify and improve biomaterials or instruments. The methods of applying bioactive agents (bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH 1-34)), as well as 3D printing will be presented from an osteoporosis treatment perspective. Additionally, the application of nanoparticles and nanotube arrays onto the current surgical treatments and orthopedic drug administration methods addressed will show that these systems reinforce a better mechanical performance and provide precise and slow-releasing drug delivery for better osseointegration, bone regeneration, and bone strength. In summary, nanomaterials can be seen as an alternative and more effective treatment for individuals with osteoporosis.", "journal": "Current osteoporosis reports", "date": "2016-08-20", "authors": ["DongleiWei", "JinsuhJung", "HuilinYang", "David AStout", "LeiYang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11914-016-0324-1"}

However, the anatomical structure of LAA is so complicated that adequate information of its structure is essential for successful LAA occlusion. Emerging 3D printing technology has the demonstrated potential to structure more accurately than conventional imaging modalities by creating tangible patient-specific models. Typically, 3D printing data sets are acquired from CT and MRI, which may involve intravenous contrast, sedation, and ionizing radiation. It has been reported that 3D models of LAA were successfully created by the data acquired from CT. However, 3D printing of the LAA using real-time 3D TEE data has not yet been explored.\nAcquisition of 3D transesophageal echocardiographic data from 8 patients with atrial fibrillation was performed using the Philips EPIQ7 ultrasound system. Raw echocardiographic image data were opened in Philips QLAB and converted to 'Cartesian DICOM' format and imported into Mimics\u00ae software to create 3D models of LAA, which were printed using a rubber-like material. The printed 3D models were then used for preoperative reference and procedural simulation in LAA occlusion.\nWe successfully printed LAAs of 8 patients. Each LAA costs approximately CNY 800-1,000 and the total process takes 16-17 h. Seven of the 8 Watchman devices predicted by preprocedural 2D TEE images were of the same sizes as those placed in the real operation. Interestingly, 3D printing models were highly reflective of the shape and size of LAAs, and all device sizes predicted by the 3D printing model were fully consistent with those placed in the real operation. Also, the 3D printed model could predict operating difficulty and the presence of a peridevice leak.\n3D printing of the LAA using real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiographic data has a perfect and rapid application in LAA occlusion to assist with physician planning and decision making.", "journal": "Cardiology", "date": "2016-08-19", "authors": ["PengLiu", "RijingLiu", "YanZhang", "YingfengLiu", "XiaomingTang", "YanzhenCheng"], "doi": "10.1159/000447444"}

The polyimide resin is biocompatible, quick to cure, and does not adhere to the plastic mold. The electrodes were tested for the response to dopamine with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry both in vitro and in vivo and performed similarly to traditional glass-insulated electrodes, but with lower background currents.

{"title": "Low-cost Design and Manufacturing of Surgical Guides for Mandibular Reconstruction Using a Fibula.", "abstract": "Surgical cutting guides are used in mandibular reconstruction involving osteotomy of the mandible and fibula. Cutting guides produced using computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technologies have been reported recently. These guides aim to increase the benefits to patients by improving the accuracy, shortening the operating time, and correcting occlusion. However, the availability of these advanced technologies is limited in some regions of the world. To test whether we could produce low-cost surgical cutting guides, we made surgical guides and investigated their accuracy.\nUsing free CAD software, we designed surgical cutting guides for the mandible and fibula and used these to perform virtual mandibular segmental osteotomies and fibula transplants in 12 model surgeries. The cutting guides were printed on a 3-dimensional (3D) printer. The model surgeries were performed using 3D mandibular models and cutting guides to check their accuracy. Deviations between the virtually simulated plan and the actual model surgery were investigated.\nCAD and CAM technologies were used to design and 3D print the cutting guides and models. The guided surgeries were performed. The deviations were about 1.3\u2009mm for mandibular osteotomy, less than 1\u2009mm for fibular osteotomy, and within 2.4\u2009mm for reconstructions of the mandible.\nWithout using expensive software or products, we were able to design surgical cutting guides for the mandible and fibula and used these to perform virtual simulation of mandibular segmental osteotomy and fibular reconstruction. Model surgeries using 3D-printed surgical guides showed that the accuracy of reconstruction was within a 3-mm deviation. In circumstances where commercial CAD/CAM guides are not available, it may be possible to use CAD/CAM surgical guides in the clinic if doctors are willing to volunteer their time for the design and printing.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

{"title": "A lab-on-a-disc with reversible and thermally stable diaphragm valves.", "abstract": "A lab-on-a-disc is a unique microfluidic platform that utilizes centrifugal force to pump liquids. This offers many benefits for point-of-care devices because it eliminates the need for connections to multiple pumps and complex tubing connections. A wide range of applications including clinical chemistry, immunoassay, cell analysis, and nucleic acid tests could be demonstrated on a spinning disc. To enable the performance of assays in a fully integrated and automated manner, the robust actuation of integrated valves is a prerequisite. However, conventional passive-type valves incur a critical drawback in that their operation is dependent on the rotational frequency, which is easily influenced by the channel geometry and chemistry, in addition to the physical properties of the liquids to be transferred. Even though a few active-type valving techniques permit the individual actuation of valves, independent of the rotational frequency, complex procedures for the fabrication as well as actuation mechanisms have prevented their broader acceptance in general applications. Here, we report on a lab-on-a-disc incorporating individually addressable diaphragm valves (ID valves) that enable the reversible and thermally stable actuation of multiple valves with unprecedented ease and robustness. These ID valves are configured from an elastic epoxy diaphragm embedded on a 3D printed push-and-twist valve, which can be easily actuated by a simple automatic driver unit.

Each end of an ex vivo trachea was sealed with a custom-designed and 3D-printed cap; a transducer was placed through one end to measure the pressure inside the trachea. Although the negative pressure was applied to the tracheal lumen, the tracheal wall collapse was measured externally and internally using a bronchoscope. Each group had at least three recorded trials. Tracheal diameter was evaluated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and was averaged between two raters.\nAverage tracheal occlusion percentage was compared using Student t test. The average occlusion was 31% for group 1, 87.4% for group 2, and 20% for group 3. Significant differences were found between the control and tracheomalacia groups (P < 0.01) and the tracheomalacia and splinted tracheomalacia groups (P < 0.01).

{"title": "Virtual Reconstruction and Three-Dimensional Printing of Blood Cells as a Tool in Cell Biology Education.", "abstract": "The cell biology discipline constitutes a highly dynamic field whose concepts take a long time to be incorporated into the educational system, especially in developing countries. Amongst the main obstacles to the introduction of new cell biology concepts to students is their general lack of identification with most teaching methods. The introduction of elaborated figures, movies and animations to textbooks has given a tremendous contribution to the learning process and the search for novel teaching methods has been a central goal in cell biology education. Some specialized tools, however, are usually only available in advanced research centers or in institutions that are traditionally involved with the development of novel teaching/learning processes, and are far from becoming reality in the majority of life sciences schools. When combined with the known declining interest in science among young people, a critical scenario may result. This is especially important in the field of electron microscopy and associated techniques, methods that have greatly contributed to the current knowledge on the structure and function of different cell biology models but are rarely made accessible to most students. In this work, we propose a strategy to increase the engagement of students into the world of cell and structural biology by combining 3D electron microscopy techniques and 3D prototyping technology (3D printing) to generate 3D physical models that accurately and realistically reproduce a close-to-the native structure of the cell and serve as a tool for students and teachers outside the main centers. We introduce three strategies for 3D imaging, modeling and prototyping of cells and propose the establishment of a virtual platform where different digital models can be deposited by EM groups and subsequently downloaded and printed in different schools, universities, research centers and museums, thereby modernizing teaching of cell biology and increasing the accessibility to modern approaches in basic science.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["IngridAugusto", "DouglasMonteiro", "WendellGirard-Dias", "Thaisa OliveiraDos Santos", "Simone Let\u00edciaRosa Belmonte", "JairoPinto de Oliveira", "HelderMauad", "Marcosda Silva Pacheco", "DominikLenz", "AthelsonStefanon Bittencourt", "BrenoValentim Nogueira", "Jorge RobertoLopes Dos Santos", "KildareMiranda", "Marco Cesar CunegundesGuimar\u00e3es"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0161184\n10.1002/mrd.22455\n10.1007/s00418-012-1002-8\n10.1016/j.jsb.2016.02.014"}

{"title": "3D-Printing for Analytical Ultracentrifugation.", "abstract": "Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a classical technique of physical biochemistry providing information on size, shape, and interactions of macromolecules from the analysis of their migration in centrifugal fields while free in solution. A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by 3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but still below 1%.

In this work we identified an optimal geometrical pattern for bone tissue engineering applications, best balancing several graft needs which correspond to competing design goals. In particular, we investigated the occurred changes in graft behavior by varying pore size (300\u03bcm, 600\u03bcm, 900\u03bcm), interpore distance (equal to pore size or 300\u03bcm fixed) and pores interconnection (absent, 45\u00b0-oriented, 90\u00b0-oriented). Mathematical considerations and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools, here combined in a complete theoretical model, were carried out to this aim. Poly-lactic acid (PLA) based samples were realized by 3D printing, basing on the modeled architectures. A collagen (COL) coating was also realized on grafts surface and the interaction between PLA and COL, besides the protein contribution to graft bioactivity, was evaluated. Scaffolds were extensively characterized; human articular cells were used to test their biocompatibility and to evaluate the theoretical model predictions.

The reproducible geometry of the scaffolds produced by this additive manufacturing technique makes them an optimal model system and facilitates the analysis. The results suggest that the mechanical performance of the hybrid scaffolds is improved monotonically with polymer concentration, but this concentration cannot be increased indefinitely if the macroporosity interconnectivity, and thus the scaffold\u05f3s capacity to promote tissue ingrowth, are to be preserved. An optimal concentration, and therefore viscosity (~1-4Pas in the present case), exists for any given set of process variables (scaffold geometry and material, polymer, solvent and process temperature) that yields coatings with optimal reinforcement and minimal reduction of scaffold functionality. Solvent and process temperature do not directly affect the strengthening provided by the polymeric coating.

However, stabilization and optimal shaping of microcatheters are sometimes difficult. Our aim was to introduce \"tailor-made\" microcatheter shapes for coil embolization using three-dimensional (3D) printed vessel models.\nSince August 2014, we have been investigating the use of 3D printed models of intracranial arterial aneurysms to produce optimally shaped microcatheters for endovascular coil embolization. Using Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine data obtained from preoperative cerebral angiography, a vessel model was produced with a 3D printer using acrylic resin. Preoperative planning of microcatheter navigation and shaping were performed using the 3D vessel models. Before the procedure, microcatheter mandrels were bent manually to the intended angle, referring to the vessel model, and then sterilized. The 3D vessel models were also sterilized with plasma and used during the procedure.\nTwenty-six patients (27 aneurysms) were treated using a total of 48 microcatheters shaped while referring to the 3D printed vessel model. Of the 48 catheters, only 9 (19%) required modification of the initial shape due to inappropriate positioning of the catheter. Only 29% of the catheter placements required repositioning due to catheter kick back. There were no procedure-related complications, including aneurysm rupture. The responses from assistants to a questionnaire administered after the embolizations on the usefulness of the technique were favorable.\nTailor-made shaping of microcatheters may facilitate easier and safer procedures in coil embolization of intracranial aneurysm.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["ToshihiroIshibashi", "HiroyukiTakao", "TakashiSuzuki", "IchiroYuki", "ShogoKaku", "IsseiKan", "KengoNishimura", "TomoakiSuzuki", "MitsuyosiWatanabe", "KostadinKaragiozov", "YuichiMurayama"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.07.005"}

The change in available chlorine and pH of the outflow irrigant were assessed.\nA total of forty root canal models (n=10 per group) were manufactured using 3D printing. Each model consisted of two longitudinal halves of an 18mm length simulated root canal with size 30 and taper 0.06. E. faecalis biofilms were grown on the apical 3mm of the models for 10days in Brain Heart Infusion broth. Biofilms were stained using crystal violet for visualization. The model halves were reassembled, attached to an apparatus and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Following 60s of 9mL of 2.5% NaOCl irrigation using syringe and needle, the irrigant was either left stagnant in the canal or activated using gutta-percha, sonic and ultrasonic methods for 30s. Images were then captured every second using an external camera. The residual biofilm percentages were measured using image analysis software. The data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and generalized linear mixed model.\nThe highest level of biofilm removal was with ultrasonic agitation (90.13%) followed by sonic (88.72%), gutta-percha (80.59%), and passive irrigation group (control) (43.67%) respectively. All agitation groups reduced the available chlorine and pH of NaOCl more than that in the passive irrigation group.\nThe 3D printing method provided a novel model to create a root canal simulation for studying and understanding a real-time biofilm removal under microscopy.

The influence of this new biofabrication technology on biology of living cells, however, is still being evaluated. Recently we have identified a mitogenic hydrogel system based on alginate sulfate which potently supports chondrocyte phenotype, but is not printable due to its rheological properties (no yield point). To convert alginate sulfate to a printable bioink, it was combined with nanocellulose, which has been shown to possess very good printability. The alginate sulfate/nanocellulose ink showed good printing properties and the non-printed bioink material promoted cell spreading, proliferation, and collagen II synthesis by the encapsulated cells. When the bioink was printed, the biological performance of the cells was highly dependent on the nozzle geometry. Cell spreading properties were maintained with the lowest extrusion pressure and shear stress. However, extruding the alginate sulfate/nanocellulose bioink and chondrocytes significantly compromised cell proliferation, particularly when using small diameter nozzles and valves.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-08-10", "authors": ["MichaelM\u00fcller", "Ece\u00d6zt\u00fcrk", "\u00d8ysteinArlov", "PaulGatenholm", "MarcyZenobi-Wong"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-016-1704-5"}

{"title": "Corrective limb osteotomy using patient specific 3D-printed guides: A technical note.", "abstract": "We describe the step-by-step process of a corrective osteotomy using 3D printed patient specific guides. Before surgery, bilateral computed tomography (CT) scans are made to plan correction in the affected limb. The digital pre-planning defines the location of the K-wires, drill holes, and the osteotomy site(s). Subsequently, a 3D printed patient specific guide is applied, which indicates the exact position of these drill holes and the osteotomies. This increases the accuracy of the surgery by means of patient specific fit of the guide. During surgery an incision is made and the guide is applied on the bone, which allows the surgeon to perform a very precise osteotomy. Next, the bone is reduced either directly using the plate and marked drill holes, or indirectly using a second reduction guide. In the latter case, the previously drilled K-wires are used to adequately position the reduction guide. Fixation of the bone fragments using plating osteosynthesis finalizes the process.

In this study, we manufactured pillared arrays made of alumina ceramics with periodicities as low as 100\u03bcm and pillar heights of 40\u03bcm employing direct inkjet printing (DIP) technique. The response of hMSC to the microstructured surfaces was monitored by measuring cell morphology, viability and formation of focal adhesion complexes. Osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs was investigated by alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization assays and expression analysis of respective markers. We demonstrated that MSCs react to the pillars with contact guidance. Subsequently, cells grow onto and form connections between the microstructures, and at the same time are directly attached to the pillars as shown by focal adhesion stainings. Cells build up tissue-like constructs with heights up to the micropillars resulting in increased cell viability and osteogenic differentiating properties.

The genotyping of the C677T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of methylenetetrahydropholate reductase (MTHFR) gene is chosen as a model.

{"title": "Three-dimensional autologous cartilage framework fabrication assisted by new additive manufactured ear-shaped templates for microtia reconstruction.", "abstract": "During microtia reconstruction, the intraoperative design of the cartilage framework is important for the appearance and symmetry of the bilateral auricles. Templates (traditionally, the X-ray film template) are usually utilized to complete the task, which can provide cues regarding size, cranioauricular angle and positioning to the surgeons. With a combination of three-dimensional (3D) scanning and additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, we utilized two different ear-shaped templates (sheet moulding and 3D templates) during the fabrication of 3D-customized autologous cartilage frameworks for auricle reconstruction.\nForty unilateral microtia patients were included in the study. All the patients underwent auricle reconstruction using the tissue-expanding technique assisted by the new AM templates. Images were processed using computer-aided design software and exported to print two different AM ear-shaped templates: sheet moulding and 3D. Both templates were assisted by the 3D framework fabrication. The 3D images of each patient's head were captured preoperatively using a 3D scanner. X-ray film templates were also made for the patients. The lengths and widths of the contralateral auricles, X-ray film and sheet moulding templates were measured in triplicate. The error of the template and the contralateral auricle were used to compare the accuracy between the two templates.\nBetween January and May 2014, 40 unilateral microtia patients aged 6-29 years were included in this study. All patients underwent auricle reconstruction using autogenous costal cartilage. The sterilized AM templates were used to assist in the framework fabrication. The operative time was decreased by an average of 15\u00a0min compared with the method assisted by the X-ray film template. Postoperative appearance evaluation (based on five indexes: symmetry, length, width, cranioauricular angle and the substructure of the reconstructed ear) was performed by both the doctors and the patients (or their parents). Follow-up (ranging from 9 to 18 months) showed that all of the patients obtained satisfactory results with life-like 3D configuration and symmetric cranioauricular angle. The follow-up showed that no surgery-related complications occurred. Comparing the accuracy of the X-ray film and sheet moulding templates, the average errors of length were 1.8\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.44\u00a0mm and 0.39\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35\u00a0mm, respectively, and the average width errors were 1.32\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.88\u00a0mm and 0.3\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47\u00a0mm, respectively.

The aim of this project was to develop an anthropomorphic phantom that can be used as a validation tool for post-SIRT imaging and its application to dosimetry.\nThe phantom design was based on anatomical data obtained from a T1-weighted volume-interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) on a Siemens Aera 1.5\u00a0T MRI scanner. The liver, lungs and abdominal trunk were segmented using the Hermes image processing workstation. Organ volumes were then uploaded to the Delft Visualization and Image processing Development Environment for smoothing and surface rendering. Triangular meshes defining the iso-surfaces were saved as stereo lithography (STL) files and imported into the Autodesk\u00ae Meshmixer software. Organ volumes were subtracted from the abdomen and a removable base designed to allow access to the liver cavity. Connection points for placing lesion inserts and filling holes were also included. The phantom was manufactured using a Stratasys Connex3 PolyJet 3D printer. The printer uses stereolithography technology combined with ink jet printing. Print material is a solid acrylic plastic, with similar properties to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).\nMeasured Hounsfield units and calculated attenuation coefficients of the material were shown to also be similar to PMMA. Total print time for the phantom was approximately 5\u00a0days. Initial scans of the phantom have been performed with Y-90 bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT, Y-90 PET/CT and Tc-99m SPECT/CT. The CT component of these images compared well with the original anatomical reference, and measurements of volume agreed to within 9\u00a0%. Quantitative analysis of the phantom was performed using all three imaging techniques. Lesion and normal liver absorbed doses were calculated from the quantitative images in three dimensions using the local deposition method.\n3D printing is a flexible and cost-efficient technology for manufacture of anthropomorphic phantom.

However, in many settings, the success of malaria elimination campaigns depends on point-of-care diagnostics with greater sensitivity than currently available RDTs. To address this need, a sample preparation method was developed to deliver more biomarkers onto a malaria RDT by concentrating the biomarker from blood sample volumes that are too large to be directly applied to a lateral flow strip.\nIn this design, Ni-NTA-functionalized magnetic beads captured the Plasmodium falciparum biomarker HRPII from a P. falciparum D6 culture spiked blood sample. This transfer of magnetic beads to the RDT was facilitated by an inexpensive 3D-printed apparatus that aligned the sample tube with the sample deposition pad and a magnet beneath the RDT. Biomarkers were released from the bead surface onto the lateral flow strip using imidazole-spiked running buffer. Kinetics of HRPII binding to the Ni-NTA beads as a function of blood sample volume were explored prior to determining the effect of the proposed method on the limit of detection of Paracheck RDTs.\nMore than 80\u00a0% of HRPII biomarkers were extracted from blood sample volumes ranging from 25 to 250\u00a0\u00b5L. The time required to reach 80\u00a0% binding ranged from 5 to 60\u00a0min, depending on sample volume.

However, microfluidic platforms typically lack the ability to create a fluidic duct, having an arbitrary flow path, and to change the path as needed without additional design and fabrication processes. To address this challenge, we present a simple yet effective approach for facile, on-demand reconfiguration of microfluidic channels using flexible polymer tubing. The tubing provides both a well-defined, cross-sectional geometry to allow reliable fluidic operation and excellent flexibility to achieve a high degree of freedom for reconfiguration of flow pathways. We demonstrate that microparticle separation and fluid mixing can be successfully implemented by reconfiguring the shape of the tubing. The tubing is coiled around a 3D-printed barrel to make a spiral microchannel with a constant curvature for inertial separation of microparticles. Multiple knots are also made in the tubing to create a highly tortuous flow path, which induces transverse secondary flows, Dean flows, and, thus, enhances the mixing of fluids.

{"title": "Magnetic Particle Imaging for High Temporal Resolution Assessment of Aneurysm Hemodynamics.", "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the capability of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) to assess the hemodynamics in a realistic 3D aneurysm model obtained by additive manufacturing. MPI was compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic digital subtraction angiography (DSA).\nThe aneurysm model was of saccular morphology (7 mm dome height, 5 mm cross-section, 3-4 mm neck, 3.5 mm parent artery diameter) and connected to a peristaltic pump delivering a physiological flow (250 mL/min) and pulsation rate (70/min). High-resolution (4 h long) 4D phase contrast flow quantification (4D pc-fq) MRI was used to directly assess the hemodynamics of the model. Dynamic MPI, MRI, and DSA were performed with contrast agent injections (3 mL volume in 3 s) through a proximally placed catheter.\n4D pc-fq measurements showed distinct pulsatile flow velocities (20-80 cm/s) as well as lower flow velocities and a vortex inside the aneurysm. All three dynamic methods (MPI, MRI, and DSA) also showed a clear pulsation pattern as well as delayed contrast agent dynamics within the aneurysm, which is most likely caused by the vortex within the aneurysm. Due to the high temporal resolution of MPI and DSA, it was possible to track the contrast agent bolus through the model and to estimate the average flow velocity (about 60 cm/s), which is in accordance with the 4D pc-fq measurements.\nThe ionizing radiation free, 4D high resolution MPI method is a very promising tool for imaging and characterization of hemodynamics in human. It carries the possibility of overcoming certain disadvantages of other modalities like considerably lower temporal resolution of dynamic MRI and limited 2D characteristics of DSA.

To demonstrate guided implant placement and the application of fixed, implant-supported prosthetic restorations with a fully digital workflow. Methods. Over a 2-year period, all patients with partial edentulism of the posterior maxilla, in need of fixed implant-supported prostheses, were considered for inclusion in this study. The protocol required intraoral scanning and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), the superimposition of dental-gingival information on bone anatomy, surgical planning, 3D-printed teeth-supported surgical templates, and modelling and milling of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) temporaries for immediate loading. After 3 months, final optical impression was taken and milled zirconia frameworks and 3D-printed models were fabricated. The frameworks were veneered with ceramic and delivered to the patients. Results. Fifteen patients were selected for this study. The surgical templates were stable. Thirty implants were placed (BTK Safe\u00ae, BTK, Vicenza, Italy) and immediately loaded with PMMA temporaries. After 3 months, the temporaries were replaced by the final restorations in zirconia-ceramic, fabricated with a fully digital process.

This study reports a novel technique for 3D printing alginate-polyacrylamide IPN gels with tunable elastic and viscoelastic properties. The viscoelastic stress relaxation behavior of the 3D printed alginate-polyacrylamide IPN hydrogels was influenced most strongly by varying the concentration of the acrylamide cross-linker (MBAA), while the elastic modulus was affected most by varying the concentration of total monomer material.

{"title": "An Optimized Small Tissue Handling System for Immunohistochemistry and In Situ Hybridization.", "abstract": "Recent development in 3D printing technology has opened an exciting possibility for manufacturing 3D devices on one's desktop. We used 3D modeling programs to design 3D models of a tissue-handling system and these models were \"printed\" in a stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer to create precision histology devices that are particularly useful to handle multiple samples with small dimensions in parallel. Our system has been successfully tested for in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos. Some of the notable features include: (1) A conveniently transferrable chamber with 6 mesh-bottomed wells, each of which can hold dozens of zebrafish embryos. This design allows up to 6 different samples to be treated per chamber. (2) Each chamber sits in a well of a standard 6-well tissue culture plate. Thus, up to 36 different samples can be processed in tandem using a single 6 well plate. (3) Precisely fitting lids prevent solution evaporation and condensation, even at high temperatures for an extended period of time: i.e., overnight riboprobe hybridization. (4) Flat bottom mesh maximizes the consistent treatment of individual tissue samples. (5) A magnet-based lifter was created to handle up to 6 chambers (= 36 samples) in unison. (6) The largely transparent resin aids in convenient visual inspection both with eyes and using a stereomicroscope. (7) Surface engraved labeling enables an accurate tracking of different samples.

Interfacing in similar devices is typically accomplished through manually punched or drilled fluidic reservoirs. We previously introduced the concept of using hand fabricated polymer inserts to template cell culture and sampling reservoirs into PDMS devices, allowing rapid stimulation and sampling of endocrine tissue. However, fabrication of the fluidic reservoirs was time consuming, tedious, and was prone to errors during device curing. Here, we have implemented computer-aided design and 3D printing to circumvent these fabrication obstacles. In addition to rapid prototyping and design iteration advantages, the ability to match these 3D-printed interface templates with channel patterns is highly beneficial. By digitizing the template fabrication process, more robust components can be produced with reduced fabrication variability. Herein, 3D-printed templates were used for sculpting millimetre-scale reservoirs into the above-channel, bulk PDMS in passively-operated, eight-channel devices designed for time-resolved secretion sampling of murine tissue. Devices were proven functional by temporally assaying glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from <10 pancreatic islets and glycerol secretion from 2 mm adipose tissue explants, suggesting that 3D-printed interface templates could be applicable to a variety of cells and tissue types.

{"title": "Embedding objects during 3D printing to add new functionalities.", "abstract": "A novel method for integrating and embedding objects to add new functionalities during 3D printing based on fused deposition modeling (FDM) (also known as fused filament fabrication or molten polymer deposition) is presented. Unlike typical 3D printing, FDM-based 3D printing could allow objects to be integrated and embedded during 3D printing and the FDM-based 3D printed devices do not typically require any post-processing and finishing. Thus, various fluidic devices with integrated glass cover slips or polystyrene films with and without an embedded porous membrane, and optical devices with embedded Corning(\u00ae) Fibrance\u2122 Light-Diffusing Fiber were 3D printed to demonstrate the versatility of the FDM-based 3D printing and embedding method. Fluid perfusion flow experiments with a blue colored food dye solution were used to visually confirm fluid flow and/or fluid perfusion through the embedded porous membrane in the 3D printed fluidic devices. Similar to typical 3D printed devices, FDM-based 3D printed devices are translucent at best unless post-polishing is performed and optical transparency is highly desirable in any fluidic devices; integrated glass cover slips or polystyrene films would provide a perfect optical transparent window for observation and visualization. In addition, they also provide a compatible flat smooth surface for biological or biomolecular applications. The 3D printed fluidic devices with an embedded porous membrane are applicable to biological or chemical applications such as continuous perfusion cell culture or biocatalytic synthesis but without the need for any post-device assembly and finishing.

{"title": "Conferring biological activity to native spider silk: A biofunctionalized protein-based microfiber.", "abstract": "Spider silk is an extraordinary material with physical properties comparable to the best scaffolding/structural materials, and as a fiber it can be manipulated with ease into a variety of configurations. Our work here demonstrates that natural spider silk fibers can also be used to organize biological components on and in devices through rapid and simple means. Micron scale spider silk fibers (5-10\u2009\u03bcm in diameter) were surface modified with a variety of biological entities engineered with pentaglutamine tags via microbial transglutaminase (mTG). Enzymes, enzyme pathways, antibodies, and fluorescent proteins were all assembled onto spider silk fibers using this biomolecular engineering/biofabrication process. Additionally, arrangement of biofunctionalized fiber should in of itself generate a secondary level of biomolecular organization. Toward this end, as proofs of principle, spatially defined arrangement of biofunctionalized spider silk fiber was shown to generate effects specific to silk position in two cases. In one instance, arrangement perpendicular to a flow produced selective head and neck carcinoma cell capture on silk with antibodies complexed to conjugated protein G. In a second scenario, asymmetric bacterial chemotaxis arose from asymmetric conjugation of enzymes to arranged silk. Overall, the biofabrication processes used here were rapid, required no complex chemistries, were biologically benign, and also the resulting engineered silk microfibers were flexible, readily manipulated and functionally active. Deployed here in microfluidic environments, biofunctional spider silk fiber provides a means to convey complex biological functions over a range of scales, further extending its potential as a biomaterial in biotechnological settings.

To meet the demand for higher throughput in vitro alternatives, this study introduces a magnetic 3D bioprinting-based vasoactivity assay. The principle behind this assay is the magnetic printing of vascular smooth muscle cells into 3D rings that functionally represent blood vessel segments, whose contraction can be altered by vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. A cost-effective imaging modality employing a mobile device is used to capture contraction with high throughput. The goal of this study was to validate ring contraction as a measure of vasoactivity, using a small panel of known vasoactive drugs. In vitro responses of the rings matched outcomes predicted by in vivo pharmacology, and were supported by immunohistochemistry.

Therefore, it has been difficult to solve several problems regarding peripheral nerve injury and repair.

The microCT images were then used to reconstruct a 3D digital model, which was used to print a 3D resin model of the nerve graft. The 3D digital model of the hANA allowed visualization of all planes. The magnified 3D resin model clearly showed the nerve bundles and basement membrane tubes of the hANA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyse the microstructure of the hANA. Compared to the SEM images, the microCT image clearly demonstrated the microstructure of the hANA cross section at a resolution of up to 1.2\u2009\u03bcm. The 3D digital model of the hANA facilitates a clear and easy understanding of peripheral nerve microstructure.

{"title": "Additive Biomanufacturing: An Advanced Approach for Periodontal Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Periodontitis is defined as a chronic inflammatory condition, characterized by destruction of the periodontium, composed of hard (i.e. alveolar bone and cementum) and soft tissues (i.e. gingiva and periodontal ligament) surrounding and supporting the teeth. In severe cases, reduced periodontal support can lead to tooth loss, which requires tissue augmentation or procedures that initiate a repair, yet ideally a regenerative response. However, mimicking the three-dimensional complexity and functional integration of the different tissue components via scaffold- and/or matrix-based guided tissue engineering represents a great challenge. Additive biomanufacturing, a manufacturing method in which objects are designed and fabricated in a layer-by-layer manner, has allowed a paradigm shift in the current manufacturing of medical devices and implants. This shift from design-to-manufacture to manufacture-to-design, seen from a translational research point of view, provides the biomedical engineering and periodontology communities a technology with the potential to achieve tissue regeneration instead of repair. In this review, the focus is put on additively biomanufactured scaffolds for periodontal applications.

{"title": "3D printed simulation models based on real patient situations for hands-on practice.", "abstract": "During the last few years, the curriculum of many dentistry schools in Germany has been reorganised. Two key aspects of the applied changes are the integration of up-to-date teaching methods and the promotion of interdisciplinarity. To support these efforts, an approach to fabricating individualised simulation models for hands-on courses employing 3D printing is presented. The models are based on real patients, thus providing students a more realistic preparation for real clinical situations. As a wide variety of dental procedures can be implemented, the simulation models can also contribute to a more interdisciplinary dental education. The data used for the construction of the models were acquired by 3D surface scanning. The data were further processed with 3D modelling software. Afterwards, the models were fabricated by 3D printing with the PolyJet technique. Three models serve as examples: a prosthodontic model for training veneer preparation, a conservative model for practicing dental bonding and an interdisciplinary model featuring carious teeth and an insufficient crown. The third model was evaluated in a hands-on course with 22 fourth-year dental students. The students answered a questionnaire and gave their personal opinion. Whilst the concept of the model received very positive feedback, some aspects of the implementation were criticised. We discuss these observations and suggest ways for further improvement.", "journal": "European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe", "date": "2016-07-30", "authors": ["EKr\u00f6ger", "MDekiff", "DDirksen"], "doi": "10.1111/eje.12229"}
{"title": "A neural network-based method for spectral distortion correction in photon counting x-ray CT.", "abstract": "Spectral CT using a photon counting x-ray detector (PCXD) shows great potential for measuring material composition based on energy dependent x-ray attenuation. Spectral CT is especially suited for imaging with K-edge contrast agents to address the otherwise limited contrast in soft tissues. We have developed a micro-CT system based on a PCXD. This system enables both 4 energy bins acquisition, as well as full-spectrum mode in which the energy thresholds of the PCXD are swept to sample the full energy spectrum for each detector element and projection angle. Measurements provided by the PCXD, however, are distorted due to undesirable physical effects in the detector and can be very noisy due to photon starvation in narrow energy bins. To address spectral distortions, we propose and demonstrate a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based spectral distortion correction mechanism, which learns to undo the distortion in spectral CT, resulting in improved material decomposition accuracy. To address noise, post-reconstruction denoising based on bilateral filtration, which jointly enforces intensity gradient sparsity between spectral samples, is used to further improve the robustness of ANN training and material decomposition accuracy. Our ANN-based distortion correction method is calibrated using 3D-printed phantoms and a model of our spectral CT system. To enable realistic simulations and validation of our method, we first modeled the spectral distortions using experimental data acquired from (109)Cd and (133)Ba radioactive sources measured with our PCXD. Next, we trained an ANN to learn the relationship between the distorted spectral CT projections and the ideal, distortion-free projections in a calibration step. This required knowledge of the ground truth, distortion-free spectral CT projections, which were obtained by simulating a spectral CT scan of the digital version of a 3D-printed phantom. Once the training was completed, the trained ANN was used to perform distortion correction on any subsequent scans of the same system with the same parameters. We used joint bilateral filtration to perform noise reduction by jointly enforcing intensity gradient sparsity between the reconstructed images for each energy bin. Following reconstruction and denoising, the CT data was spectrally decomposed using the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and a K-edge material (i.e. iodine). The ANN-based distortion correction approach was tested using both simulations and experimental data acquired in phantoms and a mouse with our PCXD-based micro-CT system for 4 bins and full-spectrum acquisition modes. The iodine detectability and decomposition accuracy were assessed using the contrast-to-noise ratio and relative error in iodine concentration estimation metrics in images with and without distortion correction. In simulation, the material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with 50% and 20% reductions in material concentration measurement error in full-spectrum and 4 energy bins cases, respectively. Overall, experimental data confirms that full-spectrum mode provides superior results to 4-energy mode when the distortion corrections are applied. The material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with as much as a 41% reduction in material concentration measurement error for full-spectrum mode, while also bringing the iodine detectability to 4-6\u2009mg ml(-1). Distortion correction also improved the 4 bins mode data, but to a lesser extent. The results demonstrate the experimental feasibility and potential advantages of ANN-based distortion correction and joint bilateral filtration-based denoising for accurate K-edge imaging with a PCXD. Given the computational efficiency with which the ANN can be applied to projection data, the proposed scheme can be readily integrated into existing CT reconstruction pipelines.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2016-07-30", "authors": ["MenghengTouch", "Darin PClark", "WilliamBarber", "Cristian TBadea"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/61/16/6132"}

When regenerative medicine is applied to the setting of chronic or ESRD, it is intuitive that endeavors to improve renal repair, promote nephrogenesis in damaged kidneys, or the de novo engineering of transplantable kidneys, could have a major impact on the current management of this pandemic. Among the different regenerative medicine technologies currently under development, cell-on-scaffold seeding technology (CSST) - involving cells seeded throughout supporting scaffold structures made from biomaterials - is the most favorable candidate in the context of realistic clinical application. In this review, we outline and describe current investigations taking place in the field of CSST as it pertains to the restoration of kidney function.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["AndreaPeloso", "RiccardoTamburrini", "LaurenEdgar", "BettinaWilm", "RaviKatari", "LauraPerin", "PatriciaMurray", "GiuseppeOrlando"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.07.038"}

Advancements in cell culture techniques have seen the rapid evolution of more complex in vitro cell culture models investigated for use in drug discovery. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture research has become a strong focal point, as this technique permits the recapitulation of the tumor microenvironment. Biologically relevant 3D cellular models have demonstrated significant promise in advancing cancer drug discovery, and will continue to play an increasing role in the future.\nIn this review, recent advances in 3D cell culture techniques and their application in tumor modeling and anti-cancer drug discovery programs are discussed. The topics include selection of cancer cells, 3D cell culture assays (associated endpoint measurements and analysis), 3D microfluidic systems and 3D bio-printing.\nAlthough advanced cancer cell culture models and techniques are becoming commonplace in many research groups, the use of these approaches has yet to be fully embraced in anti-cancer drug applications.

{"title": "Surface delivery of tunable doses of BMP-2 from an adaptable polymeric scaffold induces volumetric bone regeneration.", "abstract": "The rapid and effective bone regeneration of large non-healing defects remains challenging. Bioactive proteins, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, are proved their osteoinductivity, but their clinical use is currently limited to collagen as biomaterial. Being able to deliver BMP-2 from any other biomaterial would broaden its clinical use. This work presents a novel means for repairing a critical size volumetric bone femoral defect in the rat by combining a osteoinductive surface coating (2D) to a polymeric scaffold (3D hollow tube) made of commercially-available PLGA. Using a polyelectrolyte film as BMP-2 carrier, we tune the amount of BMP-2 loaded in and released from the polyelectrolyte film coating over a large extent by controlling the film crosslinking level and initial concentration of BMP-2 in solution. Using microcomputed tomography and quantitative analysis of the regenerated bone growth kinetics, we show that the amount of newly formed bone and kinetics can be modulated: an effective and fast repair was obtained in 1-2 weeks in the best conditions, including complete defect bridging, formation of vascularized and mineralized bone tissue. Histological staining and high-resolution computed tomography revealed the presence of bone regeneration inside and around the tube with spatially distinct organization for trabecular-like and cortical bones. The amount of cortical bone and its thickness increased with the BMP-2 dose. In view of the recent developments in additive manufacturing techniques, this surface-coating technology may be applied in combination with various types of polymeric or metallic scaffolds to offer new perspectives of bone regeneration in personalized medicine.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["MichaelBouyer", "RaphaelGuillot", "JonathanLavaud", "CedricPlettinx", "C\u00e9cileOlivier", "V\u00e9roniqueCurry", "JeanBoutonnat", "Jean-LucColl", "Fran\u00e7oisePeyrin", "V\u00e9roniqueJosserand", "GeorgesBettega", "CatherinePicart"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.001"}

In this work, a series of 3D-printed LOC devices were designed and manufactured via stereolithography (SL) in a matter of hours. The spectroscopic performance of a variety of optical fibre combinations were tested, and the optimum path length for performing Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy determined. The information gained in these trials was then used in a reaction optimisation for the formation of carvone semicarbazone. The production of high resolution surface channels (100-500 \u03bcm) means that these devices were capable of handling a wide range of concentrations (9 \u03bcM-38 mM), and are ideally suited to both analyte detection and process optimisation. This ability to tailor the chip design and its integrated features as a direct result of the reaction being assessed, at such a low time and cost penalty greatly increases the user's ability to optimise both their device and reaction.

The objective was an easily maneuverable device, freeing one hand without compromising flexibility and safety. This could avoid the need for a second surgeon or a bulky holder, thus improving coordination.\nThe initial concept arose from the observation that intraventricular endoscopy is often performed by 2 surgeons, 1 navigating the endoscope and 1 inserting/handling instruments through the working channel. A specification analysis was performed. Desired properties were specified through a literature review, as well as informal interviews with surgeons and engineers. Tools used for the design included blueprints, 3-dimensional computer aided-design and cooperating with engineers. The final prototype was 3D-printed and the toruses were produced with molding.\nA prototype named BuESta (Burr hole Endoscope Stabililizer) was produced. This consists of 2 half hollow sphere parts and interchangeable toruses and has the following features: easy to produce, inexpensive, not prolonging surgical time, semirigid, variable fixation, easy to fix/release, safe, no bulky articulated arms, mimicking basic concepts of second hand fixation (index finger/thumb fixation, hand resting/stabilizing on skull).\nThis work represents a feasibility study including specification analysis, design and prototyping of a novel Burr hole endoscope stabilizing device. The device offers variable support for the endoscope, from complete free-hand to semirigid to rigid, thus freeing one hand which is often used to stabilize the endoscope.

Although computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging are capable of providing 3D anatomical descriptions, this type of technology is not readily available in a clinic setting. Current imaging of the oropharynx is performed using a light source and tongue depressors. For better assessment of the inferior pole of the tonsils and tongue base flexible laryngoscopes are required which only provide a two dimensional (2D) rendering.

In this report, we designed a hand held portable oral camera with 3D imaging capability to reconstruct the anatomy of the oropharynx in tonsillar hypertrophy where the tonsils get enlarged and can lead to increased airway resistance.

{"title": "Engineering zonal cartilage through bioprinting collagen type II hydrogel constructs with biomimetic chondrocyte density gradient.", "abstract": "Cartilage tissue engineering is a promising approach for repairing and regenerating cartilage tissue. To date, attempts have been made to construct zonal cartilage that mimics the cartilaginous matrix in different zones. However, little attention has been paid to the chondrocyte density gradient within the articular cartilage. We hypothesized that the chondrocyte density gradient plays an important role in forming the zonal distribution of extracellular matrix (ECM).\nIn this study, collagen type II hydrogel/chondrocyte constructs were fabricated using a bioprinter. Three groups were created according to the total cell seeding density in collagen type II pre-gel: Group A, 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910(7) cells/mL; Group B, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(7) cells/mL; and Group C, 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(7) cells/mL. Each group included two types of construct: one with a biomimetic chondrocyte density gradient and the other with a single cell density. The constructs were cultured in vitro and harvested at 0, 1, 2, and 3\u00a0weeks for cell viability testing, reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), biochemical assays, and histological analysis.\nWe found that total ECM production was positively correlated with the total cell density in the early culture stage, that the cell density gradient distribution resulted in a gradient distribution of ECM, and that the chondrocytes' biosynthetic ability was affected by both the total cell density and the cell distribution pattern.\nOur results suggested that zonal engineered cartilage could be fabricated by bioprinting collagen type II hydrogel constructs with a biomimetic cell density gradient. Both the total cell density and the cell distribution pattern should be optimized to achieve synergistic biological effects.", "journal": "BMC musculoskeletal disorders", "date": "2016-07-22", "authors": ["XiangRen", "FuyouWang", "ChengChen", "XiaoyuanGong", "LiYin", "LiuYang"], "doi": "10.1186/s12891-016-1130-8\n10.1016/j.mporth.2009.01.003\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0363\n10.1097/00004424-200010000-00003\n10.1007/s00167-008-0663-2\n10.1126/science.1222454\n10.1016/j.joca.2014.12.011\n10.1055/s-0034-1396014\n10.1186/1471-2474-13-251\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B5.21832\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1297\n10.1053/joca.2002.0814\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204244\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0088\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.12.030\n10.1016/S8756-3282(03)00083-8\n10.1089/ten.2006.0292\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1016/0003-2697(88)90532-5\n10.1002/adma.201302042\n10.1186/ar2195\n10.1089/ten.teb.2008.0563\n10.1016/S1357-2725(02)00301-1\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1007/s00253-013-4853-6\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0004\n10.1002/biot.200900004\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00121-6\n10.1002/bit.22361\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00340-5\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00143-1\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00067-4\n10.1002/bit.20828\n10.1016/j.actbio.2005.07.009\n10.1243/09544119JEIM288\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.020\n10.1016/S1063-4584(03)00090-6\n10.1007/s10439-010-0096-1"}

The detection of CTCs within the large number of healthy blood cells is a big challenge due to their rarity, which requires a detection method with supersensitivity and high specificity. In this study, we developed three kinds of new nanoparticles with the function of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), gold nanorods (AuNRs), and gold nanostars (AuNSs) with similar particle size, similar modifications, and different shapes for CTC detection without an enrichment process from the blood. The nanoparticles possess strong SERS signal due to modification of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) (i.e., Raman reporter molecule), possess excellent specificity due to stabilization of reductive bovine serum albumin (rBSA) to reduce the nonspecific catching or uptake by healthy cells in blood, and possess high sensitivity due to conjugation of folic acid (FA) (i.e., a targeted ligand) to identify CTCs. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the results of detection demonstrate that these nanoparticles could all be utilized for CTC detection without enrichment process from the blood with high specificity, and the AuNS-MBA-rBSA-FA is the best one due to its supersensitivity, whose limit of detection (i.e., 1 cell/mL) is much lower than the currently reported lowest value (5 cells/mL).", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-07-20", "authors": ["XiaoxiaWu", "YuanzhiXia", "YoujuHuang", "JuanLi", "HuiminRuan", "TianxiangChen", "LiqiangLuo", "ZheyuShen", "AiguoWu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b07205"}

Here, we investigated the suitability of gelMA/gellan for cartilage bioprinting. Multiple concentrations, ranging from 3% to 20% gelMA with 0%-1.5% gellan gum, were evaluated for their printability, defined as the ability to form filaments and to incorporate cells at 15 \u00b0C-37 \u00b0C.

Stiffness of UV-cured constructs, as well as cartilage-like tissue formation by embedded chondrocytes, were determined in vitro. A large range of gelMA/gellan concentrations were printable with inclusion of cells and formed the bioprinting window. The addition of gellan gum improved filament deposition by inducing yielding behavior, increased construct stiffness and supported chondrogenesis. High gellan gum concentrations, however, did compromise cartilage matrix production and distribution, and even higher concentrations resulted in too high yield stresses to allow cell encapsulation.

The goal of this study is to design and manufacture a 3D-printed lumbar cage for lumbar interbody fusion. Optimisations of the proposed implant design and its printing parameters were achieved via in silico analysis.

Preliminary in vitro cell culture tests such as morphological assessment and metabolic activities were performed to access biocompatibility of 3D-printed constructs. Results of in silico analysis provided a useful platform to test preliminary cage design and to find an optimal value of filling density for 3D printing process. Surface characterisation confirmed a uniform coating of nHAp with nanoscale topography. Mechanical evaluation showed mechanical properties of final cage design similar to that of trabecular bone.

{"title": "Multiscale metallic metamaterials.", "abstract": "Materials with three-dimensional micro- and nanoarchitectures exhibit many beneficial mechanical, energy conversion and optical properties. However, these three-dimensional microarchitectures are significantly limited by their scalability. Efforts have only been successful only in demonstrating overall structure sizes of hundreds of micrometres, or contain size-scale gaps of several orders of magnitude. This results in degraded mechanical properties at the macroscale. Here we demonstrate hierarchical metamaterials with disparate three-dimensional features spanning seven orders of magnitude, from nanometres to centimetres. At the macroscale they achieve high tensile elasticity (>20%) not found in their brittle-like metallic constituents, and a near-constant specific strength. Creation of these materials is enabled by a high-resolution, large-area additive manufacturing technique with scalability not achievable by two-photon polymerization or traditional stereolithography. With overall part sizes approaching tens of centimetres, these unique nanostructured metamaterials might find use in a broad array of applications.", "journal": "Nature materials", "date": "2016-07-19", "authors": ["XiaoyuZheng", "WilliamSmith", "JulieJackson", "BryanMoran", "HuachenCui", "DaChen", "JianchaoYe", "NicholasFang", "NicholasRodriguez", "ToddWeisgraber", "Christopher MSpadaccini"], "doi": "10.1038/nmat4694"}

In this report, the 3D planning is described for a patient presenting with a Class III incisor relationship on a Skeletal III base with pan facial asymmetry complicated by reverse overjet and anterior open bite. A combined scan data of direct cone beam computer tomography and indirect dental scan were used in the planning. Additionally, a new method of establishing optimum intercuspation by scanning dental casts in final occlusion and positioning it to the composite-scans model was shown. Furthermore, conventional model surgery planning was carried out following in-house protocol. Intermediate and final intermaxillary splints were produced following the conventional method and 3D printing. Three-dimensional planning showed great accuracy and treatment outcome and reduced laboratory time in comparison with the conventional method. Establishing the final dental occlusion on casts and integrating it in final 3D planning enabled us to achieve the best possible intercuspation.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2016-07-19", "authors": ["MuhanadHatamleh", "CatherineTurner", "GurpritBhamrah", "GavinMack", "JonasOsher"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000002877"}
{"title": "Tissue engineering with gellan gum.", "abstract": "Engineering complex tissues for research and clinical applications relies on high-performance biomaterials that are amenable to biofabrication, maintain mechanical integrity, support specific cell behaviours, and, ultimately, biodegrade. In most cases, complex tissues will need to be fabricated from not one, but many biomaterials, which collectively fulfill these demanding requirements. Gellan gum is an anionic polysaccharide with potential to fill several key roles in engineered tissues, particularly after modification and blending. This review focuses on the present state of research into gellan gum, from its origins, purification and modification, through processing and biofabrication options, to its performance as a cell scaffold for both soft tissue and load bearing applications. Overall, we find gellan gum to be a highly versatile backbone material for tissue engineering research, upon which a broad array of form and functionality can be built.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2016-07-19", "authors": ["L RStevens", "K JGilmore", "G GWallace", "MIn Het Panhuis"], "doi": "10.1039/c6bm00322b"}

In particular, there are not many reports on biocompatibility qualities. In this study, pure Ti films were manufactured using EBM. While it is reported that moderately hydrophilic biomaterial surfaces display improved cell growth and biocompatibility, contact angle measurements on the EBM-produced pure Ti films showed slight hydrophobicity. Nonetheless, we found the cell count of both fibroblast-like cells (L929) and osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1) increased on pure Ti films, especially the MC3T3-E1, which increased more than that of the control. In addition, the morphology of L929 and MC3T3-E1 was polygonal and spindle-shaped and the cytoskeleton was well developed in the pure Ti surface groups. Upon staining with Alizarin red S, a slight calcium deposition was observed and this level gradually rose to a remarkable level.

Also called additive manufacturing (AM), the recent increase in the use of 3DP is likely due to lower-cost printers as well as breakthroughs in techniques and processing. This thematic narrative review serves to introduce the rehabilitation professional to 3DP technology and how it is being applied to orthoses, prostheses, and assistive technology (AT). The basics of the technology, as well as the benefits and challenges of using it within the rehabilitation framework, are described. Proponents of the technology suggest that 3DP offers not only a better way to make devices, but a better way to make improved devices.

For neural stimulation, materials are required to exhibit high capacitance and to form intimate contact with neurons for eliciting effective neural responses at acceptably low voltages. Here we report on a new high capacitance material fabricated using nitrogen included ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD). After exposure to oxygen plasma for 3\u00a0h, the activated N-UNCD exhibited extremely high electrochemical capacitance greater than 1\u00a0mF/cm(2), which originates from the special hybrid sp(2)/sp(3) structure of N-UNCD. The in\u00a0vitro biocompatibility of the activated N-UNCD was then assessed using rat cortical neurons and surface roughness was found to be critical for healthy neuron growth, with best results observed on surfaces with a roughness of approximately 20\u00a0nm. Therefore, by using oxygen plasma activated N-UNCD with appropriate surface roughness, and considering the chemical and mechanical stability of diamond, the fabricated neural interfaces are expected to exhibit high efficacy, long-term stability and a healthy neuron/electrode interface.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-07-18", "authors": ["WeiTong", "KateFox", "AkramZamani", "Ann MTurnley", "KumaraveluGanesan", "ArmanAhnood", "RosemaryCicione", "HamishMeffin", "StevenPrawer", "AlastairStacey", "David JGarrett"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.07.006"}

A simple and robust automated process for the release and isolation of N-glycans would greatly improve analytical throughput and reproducibility, and is thus highly desirable. Inspired by the increasing number of reported projects involving open source labware, which allows the design and construction of otherwise inaccessible laboratory equipment using low-cost 3D printers, we used this technique to fabricate a platform for the automated isolation of N-glycans.

The nasal cell model was optimized for barrier properties in terms of permeation marker and mucus production. RT-qPCR was used to determine the xenobiotic transporter gene expression of RPMI 2650 cells in comparison with primary nasal cells. After 14days in culture, the cells were shown to produce mucus, and to express TEER (define) values and sodium fluorescein permeability consistent with values reported for excised human nasal mucosa. In addition, good correlation was found between RPMI 2650 and primary nasal cell transporter expression values. The purpose-built 3D printed model of the nose takes the form of an expansion chamber with inserts for cells and an orifice for insertion of a spray drug delivery device. This model was validated against the FDA glass chamber with cascade impactors that is currently approved for studies of nasal products. No differences were found between the two apparatus.

Innovative methodologies such as additive manufacturing, and alternative bioprocesses, such as cell therapeutic delivery, where cell encapsulation is a key tool are rapidly gaining importance for their potential in regenerative medicine. Responsive materials such as elastin-based recombinant expression products have features that are particularly attractive for cell encapsulation. They can be designed and tailored to meet desired requirements. Thus, they represent promising candidates for the development of new concept-based materials that can be employed in this field. Areas covered: An overview of the design and employment of elastin-like polypeptides for cell encapsulation is given to outline the state of the art. Special attention is paid to the design of the macromolecule employed as well as to the method of matrix formation and the biological system involved. Expert opinion: As a result of recent progress in regenerative medicine there is a compelling need for materials that provide specific properties and demonstrate defined functional features. Rationally designed materials that may adapt according to applied external stimuli and that are responsive to biological systems, such as elastin-like polypeptides, belong to this class of smart material. A run through the components described to date represents a good starting point for further advancement in this area.

{"title": "Composite 3D-printed metastructures for low-frequency and broadband vibration absorption.", "abstract": "Architected materials that control elastic wave propagation are essential in vibration mitigation and sound attenuation. Phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials use band-gap engineering to forbid certain frequencies from propagating through a material. However, existing solutions are limited in the low-frequency regimes and in their bandwidth of operation because they require impractical sizes and masses. Here, we present a class of materials (labeled elastic metastructures) that supports the formation of wide and low-frequency band gaps, while simultaneously reducing their global mass. To achieve these properties, the metastructures combine local resonances with structural modes of a periodic architected lattice. Whereas the band gaps in these metastructures are induced by Bragg scattering mechanisms, their key feature is that the band-gap size and frequency range can be controlled and broadened through local resonances, which are linked to changes in the lattice geometry. We demonstrate these principles experimentally, using advanced additive manufacturing methods, and inform our designs using finite-element simulations. This design strategy has a broad range of applications, including control of structural vibrations, noise, and shock mitigation.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2016-07-14", "authors": ["Kathryn HMatlack", "AntonBauhofer", "SebastianKr\u00f6del", "AntonioPalermo", "ChiaraDaraio"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1600171113"}
{"title": "Methods for Measuring the Orientation and Rotation Rate of 3D-printed Particles in Turbulence.", "abstract": "Experimental methods are presented for measuring the rotational and translational motion of anisotropic particles in turbulent fluid flows. 3D printing technology is used to fabricate particles with slender arms connected at a common center. Shapes explored are crosses (two perpendicular rods), jacks (three perpendicular rods), triads (three rods in triangular planar symmetry), and tetrads (four arms in tetrahedral symmetry). Methods for producing on the order of 10,000 fluorescently dyed particles are described. Time-resolved measurements of their orientation and solid-body rotation rate are obtained from four synchronized videos of their motion in a turbulent flow between oscillating grids with R\u03bb = 91. In this relatively low-Reynolds number flow, the advected particles are small enough that they approximate ellipsoidal tracer particles. We present results of time-resolved 3D trajectories of position and orientation of the particles as well as measurements of their rotation rates.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2016-07-13", "authors": ["Brendan CCole", "Guy GMarcus", "ShimaParsa", "StefanKramel", "RuiNi", "Greg AVoth"], "doi": "10.3791/53599"}
{"title": "Comparison of three-dimensional printing and vacuum freeze-dried techniques for fabricating composite scaffolds.", "abstract": "In this study, the performances of different preparation methods of the scaffolds were analyzed for chondrocyte tissue engineering. Silk fibroin/collagen (SF/C) was fabricated using a vacuum freeze-dried technique and by 3D printing. The porosity, water absorption expansion rates, mechanical properties, and pore sizes of the resulting materials were evaluated. The proliferation and metabolism of the cells was detected at different time points using an MTT assay. Cell morphologies and distributions were observed by histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porosity, water absorption expansion rate, and Young's modulus of the material obtained via 3D printing were significantly higher than those obtained by the freeze-dried method, while the pore size did not differ significantly between the two methods. MTT assay results showed that the metabolism of cells seeded on the 3D printed scaffolds was more viable than the metabolism on the freeze-dried material. H&E staining of the scaffolds revealed that the number of cells in the 3D printed scaffold was higher in comparison to a similar measurement on the freeze-dried material. Consequently, stem cells grew well inside the 3D printed scaffolds, as measured by SEM, while the internal structure of the freeze-dried scaffold was disordered. Compared with the freeze-dried technique, the 3D printed scaffold exhibited better overall performance and was more suitable for cartilage tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2016-07-13", "authors": ["KaiSun", "RuixinLi", "WenxueJiang", "YufuSun", "HuiLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.07.050"}
{"title": "Fracture behaviors of ceramic tissue scaffolds for load bearing applications.", "abstract": "Healing large bone defects, especially in weight-bearing locations, remains a challenge using available synthetic ceramic scaffolds. Manufactured as a scaffold using 3D printing technology, Sr-HT-Gahnite at high porosity (66%) had demonstrated significantly improved compressive strength (53\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009MPa) and toughness. Nevertheless, the main concern of ceramic scaffolds in general remains to be their inherent brittleness and low fracture strength in load bearing applications. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a robust numerical framework for predicting fracture strengths of such scaffolds. Since crack initiation and propagation plays a critical role on the fracture strength of ceramic structures, we employed extended finite element method (XFEM) to predict fracture behaviors of Sr-HT-Gahnite scaffolds. The correlation between experimental and numerical results proved the superiority of XFEM for quantifying fracture strength of scaffolds over conventional FEM. In addition to computer aided design (CAD) based modeling analyses, XFEM was conducted on micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) based models for fabricated scaffolds, which took into account the geometric variations induced by the fabrication process. Fracture strengths and crack paths predicted by the \u03bcCT-based XFEM analyses correlated well with relevant experimental results. The study provided an effective means for the prediction of fracture strength of porous ceramic structures, thereby facilitating design optimization of scaffolds.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-07-13", "authors": ["AliEntezari", "Seyed-ImanRoohani-Esfahani", "ZhongpuZhang", "HalaZreiqat", "Colin RDunstan", "QingLi"], "doi": "10.1038/srep28816"}
{"title": "A Broad Overview and Review of CRISPR-Cas Technology and Stem Cells.", "abstract": "The pinnacle of four decades of research, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and genome editing with the advent of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) now promise to take drug development and regenerative medicine to new levels and to enable the interrogation of disease mechanisms with a hitherto unimaginable level of model fidelity. Autumn 2014 witnessed the first patient receiving iPSCs differentiated into retinal pigmented epithelium to treat macular degeneration. Technologies such as 3D bioprinting may now exploit these advances to manufacture organs in a dish. As enticing as these prospects are, these technologies demand a deeper understanding, which will lead to improvements in their safety and efficacy. For example, precise and more efficient reprogramming for iPSC production is a requisite for wider clinical adoption. Improving awareness of the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) and genomic epigenetic status will contribute to the achievement of these aims. Similarly, increased efficiency, avoidance of off-target effects, and expansion of available target sequences are critical to the uptake of genome editing technology. In this review, we survey the historical development of genetic manipulation and stem cells. We explore the potential of genetic manipulation of iPSCs for in vitro disease modeling, generation of new animal models, and clinical applicability. We highlight the aspects that define CRISPR-Cas as a breakthrough technology, look at gene correction, and consider some important ethical and societal implications of this approach.", "journal": "Current stem cell reports", "date": "2016-07-12", "authors": ["Simon NWaddington", "RiccardoPrivolizzi", "RajvinderKarda", "Helen CO'Neill"], "doi": "10.1007/s40778-016-0037-5\n10.1353/pbm.1966.0027\n10.1073/pnas.27.11.499\n10.1073/pnas.47.10.1588\n10.1084/jem.79.2.137\n10.1073/pnas.60.4.1288\n10.1038/newbio237035a0\n10.1084/jem.137.4.1091\n10.1007/BF00464689\n10.1073/pnas.72.6.1981\n10.1038/284422a0\n10.1126/science.6246577\n10.1016/0092-8674(77)90333-6\n10.1016/0092-8674(80)90358-X\n10.1073/pnas.77.12.7380\n10.1016/0092-8674(81)90376-7\n10.1038/294092a0\n10.1073/pnas.78.8.5016\n10.1128/MCB.2.11.1372\n10.1038/317230a0\n10.2307/3570892\n10.1038/292154a0\n10.1073/pnas.78.12.7634\n10.1038/309255a0\n10.1016/0092-8674(87)90646-5\n10.1073/pnas.86.22.8927\n10.1126/science.282.5391.1145\n10.1038/nbt788\n10.1016/0092-8674(83)90344-6\n10.1128/MCB.2.4.426\n10.1016/0092-8674(81)90034-9\n10.1073/pnas.82.11.3567\n10.1093/nar/12.4.1925\n10.1016/0092-8674(81)90447-5\n10.1073/pnas.81.20.6466\n10.1038/357455a0\n10.1056/NEJMoa012616\n10.1056/NEJM200301163480314\n10.1038/nj7041-530a\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1038/nature05934\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.1038/nmeth.3507\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/044102\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.08.012\n10.3389/fcell.2015.00002\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.08.023\n10.1038/nature14046\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.005\n10.1186/s12864-015-1706-y\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3007280\n10.1038/nature03556\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.052308.093131\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.005\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.04.004\n10.1038/nrg2842\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.11.011\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.03.006\n10.1126/science.350.6267.1456\n10.1038/nm1115-1239\n10.1126/science.1232033\n10.7554/eLife.00471\n10.1038/srep05105\n10.1126/science.1138140\n10.1016/j.virol.2012.10.003\n10.1126/science.1179555\n10.1038/nature10886\n10.1126/science.1159689\n10.1093/nar/gkm360\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010060\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035888\n10.1186/1745-6150-1-7\n10.1093/nar/gks216\n10.1099/mic.0.27437-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004169\n10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.025\n10.1126/science.1225829\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.002\n10.1038/nbt.2884\n10.1126/science.1254445\n10.1038/gt.2015.2\n10.1073/pnas.1405186111\n10.1073/pnas.1407473111\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.027\n10.1128/AEM.02625-10\n10.1186/s13059-015-0817-8\n10.1093/mp/sst075\n10.1172/JCI72992\n10.1038/nature14592\n10.1186/s13059-015-0823-x\n10.1073/pnas.92.20.9011\n10.1002/hast.484\n10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5\n10.1080/15265161.2015.1103814\n10.1146/annurev-genet-112414-054926\n10.1038/mt.2015.83\n10.1016/j.crvi.2015.07.005"}
{"title": "Unveiling the adsorption mechanism of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 with high efficiency for removal of copper ions from aqueous solutions.", "abstract": "Among the heavy metal ions, copper(ii) can cause eye and liver damage at high uptake. The existence of copper ions (Cu(2+)) even with an ultralow concentration of less than 0.1 \u03bcg g(-1) can be toxic to living organisms. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop efficient adsorbents to remove Cu(2+) from aqueous solutions. In this work, without any surface functionalization or pretreatment, a water-stable zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) synthesized at room temperature is directly used as a highly efficient adsorbent for removal of copper ions from aqueous solutions. To experimentally unveil the adsorption mechanism of Cu(2+) by using ZIF-8, we explore various effects from a series of important factors, such as pH value, contact time, temperature and initial Cu(2+) concentration. As a result, ZIF-8 nanocrystals demonstrate an unexpected high adsorption capacity of Cu(2+) and high removal efficiency for both high and low concentrations of Cu(2+) from water. Moreover, ZIF-8 nanocrystals possess fast kinetics for removing Cu(2+) with the adsorption time of less than 30 min. In addition, the pH of the solution ranging from 3 to 6 shows little effect on the adsorption of Cu(2+) by ZIF-8. The adsorption mechanism is proposed for the first time and systematically verified by various characterization techniques, such as TEM, FTIR, XPS, XRD and SEM.", "journal": "Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "date": "2016-07-12", "authors": ["YujieZhang", "ZhiqiangXie", "ZhuqingWang", "XuhuiFeng", "YingWang", "AiguoWu"], "doi": "10.1039/c6dt01827k"}

Hydrogels can also provide a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for homogeneously suspended cells that retains their rounded morphology and thus facilitates chondrogenesis in cartilage tissue engineering. However, fabricating hydrogel scaffolds or cell-laden hydrogel constructs with a predesigned external shape and internal structure that does not collapse remains challenging because of the low viscosity and high water content of hydrogel precursors. Here, we present a study on the fabrication of (cell-laden) alginate hydrogel constructs using a 3D bioplotting system supplemented with a submerged cross-linking process. Swelling, mechanical properties and protein release profiles were examined and tuned by controlling the initial cross-linking density. Porous cell-laden alginate hydrogel constructs were also fabricated and cell viability, cell proliferation, and cartilaginous ECM deposition were investigated.

{"title": "Planning of mandibular reconstructions based on statistical shape models.", "abstract": "The reconstruction of large continuity defects of the mandible is a challenging task, especially when the shape of the missing part is not known prior to operation. Today, the surgical planning is based mainly on visual judgment and the individual skills and experience of the surgeons. The objective of the current study was to develop a computer-based method that is capable of proposing a reconstruction shape from a known residual mandible part.\nThe volumetric data derived from 60 CT scans of mandibles were used as the basis for the novel numerical procedure. To find a standardized representation of the mandible shapes, a mesh was elaborated that follows the course of anatomical structures with a specially developed topology of quadrilaterals. These standard meshes were transformed with defined mesh modifications toward each individual mandible surface to allow for further statistical evaluations. The data were used to capture the inter-individual shape variations that were considered as random field variations and mathematically evaluated with principal component analysis. With this information of the mandibular shape variations, an algorithm was developed that proposes shapes for reconstruction planning based on given residual mandible geometry parts.\nThe accuracy of the novel method was evaluated on six different virtually defined continuity defects that were each created on three mandibles that were not part of the initial database. Virtual reconstructions showed sufficient accuracy of the algorithm for the planning of surgical reconstructions, with average deviations toward the actual geometry of [Formula: see text]\u00a0mm for small missing parts and 5\u00a0mm for large hemi-lateral defects.\nThe presented algorithm may be a valuable tool for the planning of mandibular reconstructions.

{"title": "Bioprinted 3D Primary Liver Tissues Allow Assessment of Organ-Level Response to Clinical Drug Induced Toxicity In Vitro.", "abstract": "Modeling clinically relevant tissue responses using cell models poses a significant challenge for drug development, in particular for drug induced liver injury (DILI). This is mainly because existing liver models lack longevity and tissue-level complexity which limits their utility in predictive toxicology. In this study, we established and characterized novel bioprinted human liver tissue mimetics comprised of patient-derived hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells in a defined architecture. Scaffold-free assembly of different cell types in an in vivo-relevant architecture allowed for histologic analysis that revealed distinct intercellular hepatocyte junctions, CD31+ endothelial networks, and desmin positive, smooth muscle actin negative quiescent stellates. Unlike what was seen in 2D hepatocyte cultures, the tissues maintained levels of ATP, Albumin as well as expression and drug-induced enzyme activity of Cytochrome P450s over 4 weeks in culture. To assess the ability of the 3D liver cultures to model tissue-level DILI, dose responses of Trovafloxacin, a drug whose hepatotoxic potential could not be assessed by standard pre-clinical models, were compared to the structurally related non-toxic drug Levofloxacin. Trovafloxacin induced significant, dose-dependent toxicity at clinically relevant doses (\u2264 4uM). Interestingly, Trovafloxacin toxicity was observed without lipopolysaccharide stimulation and in the absence of resident macrophages in contrast to earlier reports. Together, these results demonstrate that 3D bioprinted liver tissues can both effectively model DILI and distinguish between highly related compounds with differential profile.

Versatile printing technologies such as extrusion-based 3D plotting allow in addition the incorporation of biological components increasing the capability to restore functional tissues. We have recently described the fabrication of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds by 3D plotting of an oil-based CPC paste under mild conditions. In the present study, we have developed a strategy for growth factor loading based on multichannel plotting: a biphasic scaffold design was realised combining CPC with VEGF-laden, highly concentrated hydrogel strands. As hydrogel component, alginate and an alginate-gellan gum blend were evaluated; the blend exhibited a more favourable VEGF release profile and was chosen for biphasic scaffold fabrication. After plotting, two-step post-processing was performed for both, hydrogel crosslinking and CPC setting, which was shown to be compatible with both materials. Finally, a scaffold was designed and fabricated which can be applied for testing in a rat critical size femur defect. Optimization of CPC plotting enabled the fabrication of highly resolved structures with strand diameters of only 200\u00a0\u00b5m. Micro-computed tomography revealed a precise strand arrangement and an interconnected pore space within the biphasic scaffold even in swollen state of the hydrogel strands.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-07-08", "authors": ["TilmanAhlfeld", "Ashwini RahulAkkineni", "YvonneF\u00f6rster", "TinoK\u00f6hler", "SvenKnaack", "MichaelGelinsky", "AnjaLode"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-016-1685-4"}

The framework presented demonstrates how sedimentation and diffusion can explain differences in particle-cell association, and provides a means to account for these effects. Finally, using in silico modeling, we predict the proportion of particles that reaches the cell surface using common experimental conditions for a wide range of inorganic and organic micro- and nanoparticles.

They comprised three men and two women of mean age 47.2\u2009years (range, 26-67\u2009years). Three of the tumors were chondrosarcomas and two chordomas. Preoperative 3-D printing models were created by 3-D printing technology. Sagittal en bloc resections were planned based on these models and successfully performed. A 360\u00b0 reconstruction was performed by spinal instrumentation in all cases. Surgical margins, perioperative complications, local control rate and survival rate were assessed.\nAll patients underwent en bloc excision via a combined posterior and anterior approach in one stage. Mean operative time and estimated blood loss were 465\u2009minutes and 1290\u2009mL, respectively. Mean follow-up was 21\u2009months. Wide surgical margins were achieved in two patients and marginal resection in three; these three patients underwent postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy. One vertebral artery was ligated and sacrificed in each of three patients. Nerve root involved by tumor was sacrificed in three patients with preoperative upper extremity weakness. One patient (Case 3) had significant transient radiculopathy with paresis postoperatively. Another (Case 4) with C 4 and C 5 chordoma had respiratory difficulties and pneumonia after surgery postoperatively. He recovered completely after 2\u2009weeks' management with a tracheotomy tube and antibiotics in the intensive care unit. No cerebrovascular complications and wound infection were observed. No local recurrence or instrumentation failure were detected during follow-up.\nThough technically challenging, it is feasible and safe to perform en bloc resection of cervical primary bone tumors. This is the most effective means of managing cervical spine tumors.

From this perspective, the objective of the study described here is to elucidate the effect of external electric field under dynamic conditions, in providing a guiding cue to osteoblasts in terms of cell-cell interactions and synthesis of prominent adhesion and cytoskeleton proteins. This was accomplished using pulsed direct current electric field of strength 0.1-1\u2009V/cm. The electric field provided guided cue to the cells to migrate toward cathode. Membrane blebbing or necrosis was nearly absent in the vicinity of cathode at 0.1 and 0.5\u2009V/cm electric field strength. Moreover, a higher cell proliferation as well as higher expression of vinculin and densely packed actin stress fibers was observed. At anode, the cells though healthy but expression of actin and vinculin was less. We underscore for the first time that the biological functionality can be favorably modulated on 3D printed scaffolds in the presence of electric field and under dynamic conditions with consequent positive effect on cell proliferation, growth, and expression level of prominent proteins.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2016-07-08", "authors": ["AKumar", "K CNune", "RdkMisra"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328216658376"}

Additive manufacturing, also referred to as three-dimensional (3D) printing, provides many advantages over existing methods.

We have fabricated a micro free-flow electrophoresis (\u03bcFFE) device using a low-cost, consumer-grade 3D printer. Test prints were performed to determine the minimum feature sizes that could be reproducibly produced using 3D printing fabrication. Microfluidic ridges could be fabricated with dimensions as small as 20 \u03bcm high \u00d7 640 \u03bcm wide. Minimum valley dimensions were 30 \u03bcm wide \u00d7 130 \u03bcm wide. An acetone vapor bath was used to smooth acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) surfaces and facilitate bonding of fully enclosed channels. The surfaces of the 3D-printed features were profiled and compared to a similar device fabricated in a glass substrate. Stable stream profiles were obtained in a 3D-printed \u03bcFFE device. Separations of fluorescent dyes in the 3D-printed device and its glass counterpart were comparable. A \u03bcFFE separation of myoglobin and cytochrome c was also demonstrated on a 3D-printed device.

In this nanocomposite, photosensitizers (Ce6) were covalently conjugated inside of mesoporous silica to enhance the PDT efficacy by shortening the distance of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and to decrease the cytotoxicity by preventing the undesired leakage of Ce6. Compared with UCNPs@mSiO2@Ce6, UCNPs@Ce6@mSiO2 greatly promoted the singlet oxygen generation and amplified the PDT efficacy under the excitation of 808\u00a0nm laser. Importantly, the designed nanoprobe can greatly improve the uptake of HER2-positive cells and tumors by modifying the site-specific peptide, and the in\u00a0vivo experiments showed excellent MRI and PDT via intravenous injection by modeling MDA-MB-435 tumor-bearing nude mice.

{"title": "Repopulating Decellularized Kidney Scaffolds: An Avenue for ", "abstract": "Recent research has shown that fully developed organs can be decellularized, resulting in a complex scaffold and extracellular matrix (ECM) network capable of being populated with other cells. This work has resulted in a growing field in bioengineering focused on the isolation, characterization, and modification of organ derived acellular scaffolds and their potential to sustain and interact with new cell populations, a process termed reseeding. In this review, we cover contemporary advancements in the bioengineering of kidney scaffolds including novel work showing that reseeded donor scaffolds can be transplanted and can function in recipients using animal models.

{"title": "Use of electrospinning and dynamic air focusing to create three-dimensional cell culture scaffolds in microfluidic devices.", "abstract": "Organs-on-a-chip has emerged as a powerful tool for pharmacological and physiological studies. A key part in the construction of such a model is the ability to pattern or culture cells in a biomimetic fashion. Most of the reported cells-on-a-chip models integrate cells on a flat surface, which does not accurately represent the extracellular matrix that they experience in vivo. Electrospinning, a technique used to generate sub-micron diameter polymer fibers, has been used as an in vitro cell culture substrate and for tissue engineering applications. Electrospinning of fibers directly into a fully sealed fluidic channel using a conventional setup has not been possible due to issues of confining the fibers into a discrete network. In this work, a dynamic focusing method was developed, with this approach enabling direct deposition of electrospun fibers into a fully sealed fluidic channel, to act as a matrix for cell culture and subsequent studies under continuous flowing conditions. Scanning electron microscopy of electrospun polycaprolactone fibers shows that this method enables the formation of fibrous layers on the inner wall of a 3D-printed fluidic device (mean fiber size = 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcm and average pore size = 113 \u00b1 19 \u03bcm(2)). Cells were able to be cultured in this 3D scaffold without the addition of adhesion proteins. Media was pumped through the channel at high flow rates (up to 400 \u03bcL min(-1)) during a dynamic cell culture process and both the fibers and the cells were found to be strongly adherent. A PDMS fluidic device was also prepared (from a 3D printed mold) and coated with polycaprolactone fibers. The PDMS device enables optical detection and confocal imaging of cultured cells on the fibers. Finally, macrophages were cultured in the devices to study how the fibrous scaffold can affect cell behavior. It was found that under lipopolysaccharide stimulation, macrophages cultured on PCL fibers inside of a channel secreted significantly more cytokines than those cultured on a thin layer of PCL in a channel or directly on the inner channel wall. Overall, this study represents a new approach for in vitro cell studies, where electrospinning can be used to easily and quickly create 3D scaffolds that can improve the culture conditions in microfluidic devices.", "journal": "The Analyst", "date": "2016-07-05", "authors": ["ChengpengChen", "Benjamin TMehl", "Scott ASell", "R ScottMartin"], "doi": "10.1039/c6an01282e"}
{"title": "A combination of three-dimensional printing and computer-assisted virtual surgical procedure for preoperative planning of acetabular fracture reduction.", "abstract": "Treatment of acetabular fractures remains one of the most challenging tasks that orthopaedic surgeons face. An accurate assessment of the injuries and preoperative planning are essential for an excellent reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy and effectiveness of performing 3D printing technology and computer-assisted virtual surgical procedures for preoperative planning in acetabular fractures. We hypothesised that more accurate preoperative planning using 3D printing models will reduce the operation time and significantly improve the outcome of acetabular fracture repair.\nTen patients with acetabular fractures were recruited prospectively and examined by CT scanning. A 3-D model of each acetabular fracture was reconstructed with MIMICS14.0 software from the DICOM file of the CT data. Bone fragments were moved and rotated to simulate fracture reduction and restore the pelvic integrity with virtual fixation. The computer-assisted 3D image of the reduced acetabula was printed for surgery simulation and plate pre-bending. The postoperative CT scan was performed to compare the consistency of the preoperative planning with the surgical implants by 3D-superimposition in MIMICS14.0, and evaluated by Matta's method.\nComputer-based pre-operations were precisely mimicked and consistent with the actual operations in all cases. The pre-bent fixation plates had an anatomical shape specifically fit to the individual pelvis without further bending or adjustment at the time of surgery and fracture reductions were significantly improved. Seven out of 10 patients had a displacement of fracture reduction of less than 1mm; 3 cases had a displacement of fracture reduction between 1 and 2mm.\nThe 3D printing technology combined with virtual surgery for acetabular fractures is feasible, accurate, and effective leading to improved patient-specific preoperative planning and outcome of real surgery. The results provide useful technical tips in planning pelvic surgeries.", "journal": "Injury", "date": "2016-07-04", "authors": ["CanjunZeng", "WeirongXing", "ZhanglinWu", "HuajunHuang", "WenhuaHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.injury.2016.03.015"}
{"title": "Design and properties of 3D scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.", "abstract": "In this study, the Voronoi tessellation method has been used to design novel bone like three dimension (3D) porous scaffolds. The Voronoi method has been processed with computer design software to obtain 3D virtual isotropic porous interconnected models, exactly matching the main histomorphometric indices of trabecular bone (trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, trabecular number, bone volume to total volume ratio, bone surface to bone volume ratio, etc.). These bone like models have been further computed for mechanical (elastic modulus) and fluid mass transport (permeability) properties. The results show that the final properties of the scaffolds can be controlled during their microstructure and histomorphometric initial design stage. It is also shown that final properties can be tuned during the design stage to exactly match those of trabecular natural bone. Moreover, identical total porosity models can be designed with quite different specific bone surface area and thus, this specific microstructural feature can be used to favour cell adhesion, migration and, ultimately, new bone apposition (i.e. osteoconduction). Once the virtual models are fully characterized and optimized, these can be easily 3D printed by additive manufacturing and/or stereolitography technologies.\nThe significance of this article goes far beyond the specific objectives on which it is focussed. In fact, it shows, in a guided way, the entire novel process that can be followed to design graded porous implants, whatever its external shape and geometry, but internally tuned to the exact histomorphometric indices needed to match natural human tissues microstructures and, consequently, their mechanical and fluid properties, among others. The significance is even more relevant nowadays thanks to the available new computing and design software that is easily linked to the 3D printing new technologies. It is this transversality, at the frontier of different disciplines, the main characteristic that gives this article a high scientific impact and interest to a broaden audience.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-07-03", "authors": ["SG\u00f3mez", "M DVlad", "JL\u00f3pez", "EFern\u00e1ndez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.06.032"}
{"title": "Properties of a monopivot centrifugal blood pump manufactured by 3D printing.", "abstract": "An impeller the same geometry as the impeller of a commercial monopivot cardiopulmonary bypass pump was manufactured using 3D printing. The 3D-printed impeller was integrated into the pump casing of the commercially available pump to form a 3D-printed pump model. The surface roughness of the impeller, the hydraulic performance, the axial displacement of the rotating impeller, and the hemolytic properties of the 3D-printed model were measured and compared with those of the commercially available model. Although the surface roughness of the 3D-printed model was significantly larger than that of the commercially available model, the hydraulic performance of the two models almost coincided. The hemolysis level of the 3D-printed model roughly coincided with that of the commercially available model under low-pressure head conditions, but increased greatly under high-pressure head conditions, as a result of the narrow gap between the rotating impeller and the pump casing. The gap became narrow under high-pressure head conditions, because the axial thrust applied to the impeller increased with increasing impeller rotational speed. Moreover, the axial displacement of the rotating impeller was twice that of the commercially available model, confirming that the elastic deformation of the 3D-printed impeller was larger than that of the commercially available impeller. These results suggest that trial models manufactured by 3D printing can reproduce the hydraulic performance of the commercial product. However, both the surface roughness and the deformation of the trial models must be considered to precisely evaluate the hemolytic properties of the model.", "journal": "Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs", "date": "2016-07-03", "authors": ["MasahiroNishida", "TakumiNegishi", "DaisukeSakota", "RyoKosaka", "OsamuMaruyama", "ToruHyakutake", "KatsuyukiKuwana", "TakashiYamane"], "doi": "10.1007/s10047-016-0914-9"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional models: an emerging investigational revolution for craniovertebral junction surgery.", "abstract": "Complex craniovertebral junctional anomalies can be daunting to treat surgically, and preoperative information regarding the osseous abnormalities, course of the vertebral arteries, size of the pedicles, and location of the transverse foramina is invaluable to surgeons operating on these challenging cases. The authors present their experience with the emerging technology of 3D model acquisition for surgery in 11 cases of complex craniovertebral junction region anomalies. For each case, a 3D printed model was made from thin CT scans using a 64-slice CT scanner. The inclination of the joints, the presence of false articulations, the size of the pedicles, and the course of the vertebral arteries were studied preoperatively on the 3D models. The sizes of the plates and screws to be used and the angle of insertion of the screws were calculated based on the data from the models. The model was scaled to actual size and was kept beside the operating surgeon in its anatomical position during surgery. The potential uses of the models and their advantages over conventional radiological investigations are discussed. The authors conclude that 3D models can be an invaluable aid during surgery for complex craniovertebral junction anomalies. The information available from a real life-size model supersedes the information available from 3D CT reconstructions and can also be superior to virtual simulation. The models are both cost effective and easy to build and the authors suggest that they may form the basis of investigations in the near future for craniovertebral junction surgery.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

{"title": "Active learning in the lecture theatre using 3D printed objects.", "abstract": "The ability to conceptualize 3D shapes is central to understanding biological processes. The concept that the structure of a biological molecule leads to function is a core principle of the biochemical field. Visualisation of biological molecules often involves vocal explanations or the use of two dimensional slides and video presentations. A deeper understanding of these molecules can however be obtained by the handling of objects. 3D printed biological molecules can be used as active learning tools to stimulate engagement in large group lectures. These models can be used to build upon initial core knowledge which can be delivered in either a flipped form or a more didactic manner. Within the teaching session the students are able to learn by handling, rotating and viewing the objects to gain an appreciation, for example, of an enzyme's active site or the difference between the major and minor groove of DNA. Models and other artefacts can be handled in small groups within a lecture theatre and act as a focal point to generate conversation. Through the approach presented here core knowledge is first established and then supplemented with high level problem solving through a \"Think-Pair-Share\" cooperative learning strategy. The teaching delivery was adjusted based around experiential learning activities by moving the object from mental cognition and into the physical environment. This approach led to students being able to better visualise biological molecules and a positive engagement in the lecture.

{"title": "3D-Printed Scaffolds and Biomaterials: Review of Alveolar Bone Augmentation and Periodontal Regeneration Applications.", "abstract": "To ensure a successful dental implant therapy, the presence of adequate vertical and horizontal alveolar bone is fundamental. However, an insufficient amount of alveolar ridge in both dimensions is often encountered in dental practice due to the consequences of oral diseases and tooth loss. Although postextraction socket preservation has been adopted to lessen the need for such invasive approaches, it utilizes bone grafting materials, which have limitations that could negatively affect the quality of bone formation.

Failure to achieve maximal hyperemia and the choice of hyperemic agents may have differential effects on coronary hemodynamics and, consequently, on the determination of fractional flow reserve.\nAn in\u00a0vitro flow system was developed to experimentally model the physiological coronary circulation as flow-dependent stenosis resistance in series with variable downstream resistance. Five idealized models with 30% to 70% diameter stenosis severity were fabricated using VeroClear rigid material in an Objet260 Connex printer. Mean aortic pressure was maintained at 7 levels (60-140\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) from hypotension to hypertension using a needle valve that mimicked adjustable microcirculatory resistance. A range of physiological flow rates was applied by a steady flow pump and titrated by a flow sensor. The pressure drop and the pressure ratio (Pd/Pa) were assessed for the 7 levels of aortic pressure and differing flow rates. The in\u00a0vitro experimental data were coupled with pressure-flow relationships from clinical data for populations with and without myocardial infarction, respectively, to evaluate fractional flow reserve. The curve for pressure ratio and flow rate demonstrated a quadratic relationship with a decreasing slope. The absolute decrease in fractional flow reserve in the group without myocardial infarction (with myocardial infarction) was on the order of 0.03 (0.02), 0.05 (0.02), 0.07 (0.05), 0.17 (0.13) and 0.20 (0.24), respectively, for 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% diameter stenosis, for an increase in aortic pressure from 60 to 140\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg.\nThe fractional flow reserve value, an index of physiological stenosis significance, was observed to decrease with increasing aortic pressure for a given stenosis in this idealized in\u00a0vitro experiment for vascular groups with and without myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2016-07-02", "authors": ["Kranthi KKolli", "James KMin", "SeongminHa", "HilarySoohoo", "GuangleiXiong"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.116.003634"}

We termed this novel artificial bone the \"CT-bone\". The aim of the present study was to evaluate the middle- and long-term safety and effectiveness of the CT-bones after transplantation.\nThe subject areas involved were 23 sites of 20 patients with facial bone deformities due to congenital abnormality, tumor, or trauma. The CT-bones were used for augmentation; they were evaluated by CT images, minimally for 1 year and maximally for 7 years and 3 months (3 years and 1 month on average) after transplantation.\nNo serious systemic events due to the CT-bone graft were found during the observation period (1 year postoperatively). In 4 sites of 4 patients, the CT-bones were removed due to local infection of the surgical wounds at 1-5 years postoperatively. Compatibility of the shapes between the CT-bone and the recipient bone was confirmed to be good during the operation in all of the 20 cases, implying that the CT-bones could be easily installed onto the recipient sites. During the CT evaluation (<7 years and 3 months), no apparent chronological change was seen in the shape of the CT-bones. Sufficient bone union was confirmed in 19 sites. The inner CT values of the CT-bones increased in all the sites. The longer the postoperative period, greater increases in the CT values of the CT-bones tended to be observed.\nThe CT-bone showed maintenance of the original shape and good bone replacement, based on the middle- and long-term follow-ups.

Therefore, an alternative design process has been used utilizing blue light scanning, computer-aided designing, and additive manufacturing direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) for microsurgical instrument prototype development. Deviations of DMLS-fabricated instrument were studied by superimposing scan data of fabricated instrument with the computer-aided designing model. Content and concurrent validity of the fabricated prototypes was done by a group of 15 neurosurgeons by performing sciatic nerve anastomosis in small laboratory animals. Comparative scoring was obtained for the control and study instrument. T test was applied to the individual parameters and P values for force (P < .0001) and surface roughness (P < .01) were found to be statistically significant.

{"title": "A tunable hydrogel system for long-term release of cell-secreted cytokines and bioprinted in situ wound cell delivery.", "abstract": "For many cellular therapies being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials, the mechanisms behind their therapeutic effects appear to be the secretion of growth factors and cytokines, also known as paracrine activity. Often, delivered cells are transient, and half-lives of the growth factors that they secrete are short, limiting their long-term effectiveness. The goal of this study was to optimize a hydrogel system capable of in situ cell delivery that could sequester and release growth factors secreted from those cells after the cells were no longer present. Here, we demonstrate the use of a fast photocross-linkable heparin-conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA-HP) hydrogel as a cell delivery vehicle for sustained growth factor release, which extends paracrine activity. The hydrogel could be modulated through cross-linking geometries and heparinization to support sustained release proteins and heparin-binding growth factors. To test the hydrogel in vivo, we used it to deliver amniotic fluid-derived stem (AFS) cells, which are known to secrete cytokines and growth factors, in full thickness skin wounds in a nu/nu murine model. Despite transience of the AFS cells in vivo, the HA-HP hydrogel with AFS cells improved wound closure and reepithelialization and increased vascularization and production of extracellular matrix in vivo. These results suggest that HA-HP hydrogel has the potential to prolong the paracrine activity of cells, thereby increasing their therapeutic effectiveness in wound healing. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This methodology combines image-based computational fluid dynamics, tissue resection, micro-CT imaging of resected specimens mounted on 3D-printed aneurysm models, alignment to 3D vascular models, multi-photon microscopy of the wall, and regional mapping of hemodynamics and wall properties. This approach employs a new 3D virtual marking tool for surgeons to delineate the location of the resected specimen directly on the 3D model, while in the surgical suite. The case of a middle cerebral artery aneurysm is used to illustrate the application of this methodology to the assessment of the relationship between local wall shear stress and local wall properties including collagen fiber organization and wall geometry.

Then, the microchannels are filled with a mixture of cellulose powder and deionized water in an appropriate proportion. After drying in an oven at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min, it is ready for use. As the different channel depths can be easily printed, which can be used to achieve the programmable capillary flow speed of cellulose powder in the microchannels. A series of microfluidic analytical experiments, including quantitative analysis of nitrite ion and fabrication of T-sensor were used to demonstrate its capability.

Despite several attempts, bioprinting of scale-up tissues at clinically-relevant dimensions with closely recapitulated tissue biology and functionality is still a major roadblock. Here, we fabricate and engineer scaffold-free scalable tissue strands as a novel bioink material for robotic-assisted bioprinting technologies. Compare to 400\u2009\u03bcm-thick tissue spheroids bioprinted in a liquid delivery medium into confining molds, near 8\u2009cm-long tissue strands with rapid fusion and self-assemble capabilities are bioprinted in solid form for the first time without any need for a scaffold or a mold support or a liquid delivery medium, and facilitated native-like scale-up tissues.

In order to maintain the precise printing resolution for anatomical tissue printing, cell seeding density in bioink is limited. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used for cartilage tissue engineering. However, the approach of ideal chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs without hypertrophy still remains elusive. Here, we reported NR2F2 plays a crucial role in MSC chondrogenesis in bioprinted cartilage. NR2F2 over-expressed MSCs showed significantly enhanced chondrogenesis and NR2F2 knockdown cells demonstrated the exactly opposite behavior. We evaluated the cells cultured in monolayer, 3D pellet, and bioprinted 3D scaffold. All observations were consistent among gene expression, biochemical analysis, histological assay, and biomechanical evaluation. The data also revealed possible involvement of NR2F2 in mechanism of MSC chondrogenic differentiation under hypoxic culture condition. Biotechnol.

Currently, nanotechnology is considered a potential eco-friendly approach in mosquito control research. We proposed a novel method of biofabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using chitosan (Ch) from crab shells. Ch-AgNP nanocomposite was characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, EDX and XRD. Ch-AgNP were tested against larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi obtaining LC50 ranging from 3.18 ppm (I) to 6.54 ppm (pupae). The antibacterial properties of Ch-AgNP were proved against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi, while no growth inhibition was reported in assays conducted on Proteus vulgaris. Concerning non-target effects, in standard laboratory considtions the predation efficiency of Danio rerio zebrafishes was 68.8% and 61.6% against I and II instar larvae of A. stephensi, respectively. In a Ch-AgNP-contaminated environment, fish predation was boosted to 89.5% and 77.3%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and LPO from hepatopancreas of fresh water crabs Paratelphusa hydrodromous exposed for 16 days to a Ch-AgNP-contaminated aquatic environment were conducted. Notably, deleterious effects of Ch-AgNP contaminating aquatic enviroment on the non-target crab P. hydrodromous were observed, particularly when doses higher than 8-10ppm are tested. Overall, this research highlights the potential of Ch-AGNP for the development of newer control tools against young instar populations of malaria mosquitoes, also highlighting some risks concerned the employ of nanoparticles in aquatic environments.", "journal": "Ecotoxicology and environmental safety", "date": "2016-06-28", "authors": ["KadarkaraiMurugan", "JaganathanAnitha", "DevakumarDinesh", "UdaiyanSuresh", "RajapandianRajaganesh", "BalamuruganChandramohan", "JayapalSubramaniam", "ManickamPaulpandi", "ChitravelVadivalagan", "PandiyanAmuthavalli", "LanWang", "Jiang-ShiouHwang", "HuiWei", "Mohamad SalehAlsalhi", "SandhanasamyDevanesan", "SureshKumar", "KannaiyanPugazhendy", "AkonHiguchi", "MarcelloNicoletti", "GiovanniBenelli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.06.021"}
{"title": "New approach for virtual surgical planning and mandibular reconstruction using a fibula free flap.", "abstract": "Maxillofacial reconstruction poses a major challenge to surgeons because of the associated anatomical complexity, the sensitivity of the involved systems and the need to maintain a pleasing facial appearance. Here, we present a detailed description of a new method for extensive mandibular reconstruction using open-source virtual design software and a desktop 3D printer. A surgeon segmented preoperative computed tomography angiography scans with the Amira program to create a digital model of the mandible, skull and fibula. These datasets were imported into Blender, an open-source computer-aided design software package, where arrangement of the fibula segments into aligned sections was performed. Then, a desktop 3D printer was used to produce a reconstructed mandible. After fixation of a plate onto the reconstructed mandible, cutting guides were digitally designed using Blender. Following this, the surgeon performed mandible resection using the fixed cutting guides, which were 3D-printed using biocompatible plastic (Med 610/Stratasys Inc.) and fixed to the prebent reconstructed mandible at a predetermined position. After cutting the fibula with the help of the cutting guides and aligning the fibular segments into mandibular space, the surgeon fixed the segments to the reconstruction plate. Postoperatively, multislice computed tomography scans were taken for control purposes. Our method for mandibular reconstruction offers the following benefits: shorter operation planning time, increased accuracy during osteotomy through the use of a special fibula cutting guide and low costs. In brief, this method is an easy, precise and highly flexible technique for mandibular reconstruction with a fibula flap.", "journal": "Oral oncology", "date": "2016-06-28", "authors": ["MatthiasMottini", "S MSeyed Jafari", "MaziarShafighi", "Beno\u00eetSchaller"], "doi": "10.1016/j.oraloncology.2016.06.001"}
{"title": "Tailored Surface Treatment of 3D Printed Porous Ti6Al4V by Microarc Oxidation for Enhanced Osseointegration via Optimized Bone In-Growth Patterns and Interlocked Bone/Implant Interface.", "abstract": "3D printed porous titanium (Ti) holds enormous potential for load-bearing orthopedic applications. Although the 3D printing technique has good control over the macro-sturctures of porous Ti, the surface properties that affect tissue response are beyond its control, adding the need for tailored surface treatment to improve its osseointegration capacity. Here, the one step microarc oxidation (MAO) process was applied to a 3D printed porous Ti6Al4V (Ti64) scaffold to endow the scaffold with a homogeneous layer of microporous TiO2 and significant amounts of amorphous calcium-phosphate. Following the treatment, the porous Ti64 scaffolds exhibited a drastically improved apatite forming ability, cyto-compatibility, and alkaline phosphatase activity. In vivo test in a rabbit model showed that the bone in-growth at the untreated scaffold was in a pattern of distance osteogenesis by which bone formed only at the periphery of the scaffold. In contrast, the bone in-growth at the MAO-treated scaffold exhibited a pattern of contact osteogenesis by which bone formed in situ on the entire surface of the scaffold. This pattern of bone in-growth significantly increased bone formation both in and around the scaffold possibly through enhancement of bone formation and disruption of bone remodeling. Moreover, the implant surface of the MAO-treated scaffold interlocked with the bone tissues through the fabricated microporous topographies to generate a stronger bone/implant interface. The increased osteoinetegration strength was further proven by a push out test. MAO exhibits a high efficiency in the enhancement of osteointegration of porous Ti64 via optimizing the patterns of bone in-growth and bone/implant interlocking. Therefore, post-treatment of 3D printed porous Ti64 with MAO technology might open up several possibilities for the development of bioactive customized implants in orthopedic applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-06-25", "authors": ["PengXiu", "ZhaojunJia", "JiaLv", "ChuanYin", "YanCheng", "KeZhang", "ChunliSong", "HuijieLeng", "YufengZheng", "HongCai", "ZhongjunLiu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b05893"}

The sources of neural stem cells are limited while the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have risk of tumor formation. Here, we proposed the generation of self-renewable, multipotent, and neural lineage-related neural crest stem-like cells by chitosan substrate-mediated gene transfer of a single factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) for the use in neural repair. A simple, non-toxic, substrate-mediated method was applied to deliver the naked FOXD3 plasmid into human fibroblasts. The transfection of FOXD3 increased cell proliferation and up-regulated the neural crest marker genes (FOXD3, SOX2, and CD271), stemness marker genes (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2), and neural lineage-related genes (Nestin, \u03b2-tubulin and GFAP). The expression levels of stemness marker genes and neural crest maker genes in the FOXD3-transfected fibroblasts were maintained until the fifth passage. The FOXD3 reprogrammed fibroblasts based on the new method significantly rescued the neural function of the impaired zebrafish. The chitosan substrate-mediated delivery of naked plasmid showed feasibility in reprogramming somatic cells.

{"title": "Inhaled Aerosol Distribution in Human Airways: A Scintigraphy-Guided Study in a 3D Printed Model.", "abstract": "While it is generally accepted that inertial impaction will lead to particle loss as aerosol is being carried into the pulmonary airways, most predictive aerosol deposition models adopt the hypothesis that the inhaled particles that remain airborne will distribute according to the gas flow distribution between airways downstream.\nUsing a 3D printed cast of human airways, we quantified particle deposition and distribution and visualized their inhaled trajectory in the human lung. The human airway cast was exposed to 6\u2009\u03bcm monodisperse, radiolabeled aerosol particles at distinct inhaled flow rates and imaged by scintigraphy in two perpendicular planes. In addition, we also imaged the distribution of aerosol beyond the airways into the five lung lobes. The experimental aerosol deposition patterns could be mimicked by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation in the same 3D airway geometry.\nIt was shown that for particles with a diameter of 6\u2009\u03bcm inhaled at flows up to 60\u2009L/min, the aerosol distribution over both lungs and the individual five lung lobes roughly followed the corresponding distributions of gas flow. While aerosol deposition was greater in the main bronchi of the left versus right lung, distribution of deposited and suspended particles toward the right lung exceeded that of the left lung. The CFD simulations also predict that for both 3 and 6\u2009\u03bcm particles, aerosol distribution between lung units subtending from airways in generation 5 did not match gas distribution between these units and that this effect was driven by inertial impaction.\nWe showed combined imaging experiments and CFD simulations to systematically study aerosol deposition patterns in human airways down to generation 5, where particle deposition could be spatially linked to the airway geometry. As particles are negotiating an increasing number of airways in subsequent branching generations, CFD predicts marked deviations of aerosol distribution with respect to ventilation distribution, even in the normal human lung.", "journal": "Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery", "date": "2016-06-24", "authors": ["SylviaVerbanck", "GhaderGhorbaniasl", "Martyn FBiddiscombe", "DusicaDragojlovic", "NathanRicks", "ChrisLacor", "BartIlsen", "Johande Mey", "DanielSchuermans", "S RichardUnderwood", "Peter JBarnes", "WalterVincken", "Omar SUsmani"], "doi": "10.1089/jamp.2016.1291"}

{"title": "3D-Printing of Arteriovenous Malformations for Radiosurgical Treatment: Pushing Anatomy Understanding to Real Boundaries.", "abstract": "Radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a challenging procedure. Accuracy of target volume contouring is one major issue to achieve AVM obliteration while avoiding disastrous complications due to suboptimal treatment. We describe a technique to improve the understanding of the complex AVM\u00a0angioarchitecture by 3D prototyping of individual lesions. Arteriovenous malformations of ten patients were prototyped by 3D printing using 3D rotational angiography (3DRA) as a template. A target volume was obtained using the 3DRA; a second volume was obtained, without awareness of the first volume, using 3DRA and the 3D-printed model. The two volumes were superimposed and the conjoint and disjoint volumes were measured. We also calculated the time needed to perform contouring and assessed the confidence of the surgeons in the definition of the target volumes using a six-point scale. The time required for the contouring of the target lesion\u00a0was shorter when the surgeons used the 3D-printed model of the AVM\u00a0(p=0.001). The average volume contoured without the 3D model was 5.6 \u00b1 3 mL whereas it was 5.2 \u00b1 2.9 mL with the 3D-printed model (p=0.003). The 3D prototypes proved to be spatially reliable. Surgeons were absolutely confident or very confident in all cases that the volume contoured using the 3D-printed model was plausible and corresponded to the real boundaries of the lesion. The total cost for each case was 50 euros whereas the cost of the 3D printer was 1600 euros. 3D prototyping of AVMs is a simple, affordable, and spatially reliable procedure that can be beneficial for radiosurgery treatment planning. According to our preliminary data, individual prototyping of the brain circulation provides an intuitive comprehension of the 3D anatomy of the lesion that can be rapidly and reliably translated into the target volume.", "journal": "Cureus", "date": "2016-06-24", "authors": ["AlfredoConti", "AntonioPontoriero", "GiuseppeIat\u00ec", "DanieleMarino", "DomenicoLa Torre", "SergioVinci", "AntoninoGerman\u00f2", "StefanoPergolizzi", "FrancescoTomasello"], "doi": "10.7759/cureus.594"}

In this study, the latest microfabrication techniques are used and a novel bioengineering approach is established to micropattern spatially controlled and perfusable vascular networks in 3D human skin equivalents using both primary and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endothelial cells. Using 3D printing technology makes it possible to control the geometry of the micropatterned vascular networks. It is verified that vascularized human skin equivalents (vHSEs) can form a robust epidermis and establish an endothelial barrier function, which allows for the recapitulation of both topical and systemic delivery of drugs. In addition, the therapeutic potential of vHSEs for cutaneous wounds on immunodeficient mice is examined and it is demonstrated that vHSEs can both promote and guide neovascularization during wound healing. Overall, this innovative bioengineering approach can enable in vitro evaluation of topical and systemic drug delivery as well as improve the potential of engineered skin constructs to be used as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of cutaneous wounds.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2016-06-23", "authors": ["Hasan EAbaci", "ZongyouGuo", "AbigailCoffman", "BrianGillette", "Wen-HanLee", "Samuel KSia", "Angela MChristiano"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500936"}

Physiological conditions of the animal and in particular of the observed organ, such as temperature and moisture are crucial for intravital imaging. Often, the microscopy stage with the animal or the organ of interest imposes limitations on how well the animal can be maintained. In addition, the access for additional oxygen supply or drug administration during the procedure is rather restricted. To address these limitations, we developed a novel intravital microscopy platform, allowing us to have improved access to the animal during the intravital microscopy procedure, as well as improved microenvironmental maintenance. The production process of this prototype platform is based on 3D printing of device parts in a single-step process. The simplicity of production and the advantages of this versatile and customizable design are shown and discussed in this paper. Our design potentially represents a major step forward in facilitating intestinal intravital imaging using fluorescent microscopy.", "journal": "Journal of microscopy", "date": "2016-06-23", "authors": ["IBurkovskiy", "CLehmann", "CJiang", "JZhou"], "doi": "10.1111/jmi.12437"}
{"title": "Isotropic Negative Thermal Expansion Metamaterials.", "abstract": "Negative thermal expansion materials are important and desirable in science and engineering applications. However, natural materials with isotropic negative thermal expansion are rare and usually unsatisfied in performance. Here, we propose a novel method to achieve two- and three-dimensional negative thermal expansion metamaterials via antichiral structures. The two-dimensional metamaterial is constructed with unit cells that combine bimaterial strips and antichiral structures, while the three-dimensional metamaterial is fabricated by a multimaterial 3D printing process. Both experimental and simulation results display isotropic negative thermal expansion property of the samples. The effective coefficient of negative thermal expansion of the proposed models is demonstrated to be dependent on the difference between the thermal expansion coefficient of the component materials, as well as on the circular node radius and the ligament length in the antichiral structures. The measured value of the linear negative thermal expansion coefficient of the three-dimensional sample is among the largest achieved in experiments to date. Our findings provide an easy and practical approach to obtaining materials with tunable negative thermal expansion on any scale.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-06-23", "authors": ["LinglingWu", "BoLi", "JiZhou"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b05717"}
{"title": "Osteogenic Differentiation of Three-Dimensional Bioprinted Constructs Consisting of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.", "abstract": "Here, we aimed to investigate osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) in three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted tissue constructs in vitro and in vivo. A 3D Bio-plotter dispensing system was used for building 3D constructs. Cell viability was determined using live/dead cell staining. After 7 and 14 days of culture, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to analyze the expression of osteogenesis-related genes (RUNX2, OSX, and OCN). Western blotting for RUNX2 and immunofluorescent staining for OCN and RUNX2 were also performed. At 8 weeks after surgery, osteoids secreted by osteogenically differentiated cells were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Masson trichrome staining, and OCN immunohistochemical staining. Results from live/dead cell staining showed that most of the cells remained alive, with a cell viability of 89%, on day 1 after printing. In vitro osteogenic induction of the 3D construct showed that the expression levels of RUNX2, OSX, and OCN were significantly increased on days 7 and 14 after printing in cells cultured in osteogenic medium (OM) compared with that in normal proliferation medium (PM). Fluorescence microscopy and western blotting showed that the expression of osteogenesis-related proteins was significantly higher in cells cultured in OM than in cells cultured in PM. In vivo studies demonstrated obvious bone matrix formation in the 3D bioprinted constructs. These results indicated that 3D bioprinted constructs consisting of hASCs had the ability to promote mineralized matrix formation and that hASCs could be used in 3D bioprinted constructs for the repair of large bone tissue defects.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-06-23", "authors": ["Xiao-FeiWang", "YangSong", "Yun-SongLiu", "Yu-ChunSun", "Yu-GuangWang", "YongWang", "Pei-JunLyu"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0157214\n10.1016/j.oooo.2015.05.022\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.04.037\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.064\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0386\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.07.006\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.078\n10.1007/s00253-013-4853-6\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.10.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.07.002\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2014.0335\n10.1007/s00441-014-1830-z\n10.1002/biot.201400305\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.025\n10.1016/j.biotechadv\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0158"}
{"title": "Numerical investigation of band gaps in 3D printed cantilever-in-mass metamaterials.", "abstract": "In this research, the negative effective mass behavior of elastic/mechanical metamaterials is exhibited by a cantilever-in-mass structure as a proposed design for creating frequency stopping band gaps, based on local resonance of the internal structure. The mass-in-mass unit cell model is transformed into a cantilever-in-mass model using the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory. An analytical model of the cantilever-in-mass structure is derived and the effects of geometrical dimensions and material parameters to create frequency band gaps are examined. A two-dimensional finite element model is created to validate the analytical results, and excellent agreement is achieved. The analytical model establishes an easily tunable metamaterial design to realize wave attenuation based on locally resonant frequency. To demonstrate feasibility for 3D printing, the analytical model is employed to design and fabricate 3D printable mechanical metamaterial. A three-dimensional numerical experiment is performed using COMSOL Multiphysics to validate the wave attenuation performance. Results show that the cantilever-in-mass metamaterial is capable of mitigating stress waves at the desired resonance frequency.

{"title": "Modulating mechanical behaviour of 3D-printed cartilage-mimetic PCL scaffolds: influence of molecular weight and pore geometry.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D)-printed poly(\u03b5)-caprolactone (PCL)-based scaffolds are increasingly being explored for cartilage tissue engineering (CTE) applications. However, ensuring that the mechanical properties of these PCL-based constructs are comparable to that of articular cartilage that they are meant to regenerate is an area that has been under-explored. This paper presents the effects of PCL's molecular weight (MW) and scaffold's pore geometric configurations; strand size (SZ), strand spacing (SS), and strand orientation (SO), on mechanical properties of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds. The results illustrate that MW has significant effect on compressive moduli and yield strength of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds. Specifically, PCL with MW of 45 K was a more feasible choice for fabrication of visco-elastic, flexible and load-bearing PCL scaffolds. Furthermore, pore geometric configurations; SZ, SS, and SO, all significantly affect on tensile moduli of scaffolds. However, only SZ and SS have statistically significant effects on compressive moduli and porosity of these scaffolds. That said, inverse linear relationship was observed between porosity and mechanical properties of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds in Pearson's correlation test. Altogether, this study illustrates that modulating MW of PCL and pore geometrical configurations of the scaffolds enabled design and fabrication of PCL scaffolds with mechanical and biomimetic properties that better mimic mechanical behaviour of human articular cartilage. Thus, the modulated PCL scaffold proposed in this study is a framework that offers great potentials for CTE applications.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-06-23", "authors": ["Adeola DOlubamiji", "ZohrehIzadifar", "Jennifer LSi", "David M LCooper", "B FrankEames", "Daniel X BChen"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025020"}

{"title": "Investigation of angiogenesis in bioactive 3-dimensional poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)/nano-hydroxyapatite scaffolds by in vivo multiphoton microscopy in murine calvarial critical bone defect.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of critical size bone defects remains a major clinical challenge because of poor bone regeneration, which is usually due to poor angiogenesis during repair. Satisfactory vascularization is a prerequisite for the survival of grafts and the integration of new tissue with existing tissue. In this work, we investigated angiogenesis in 3D scaffolds by in vivo multiphoton microscopy during bone formation in a murine calvarial critical bone defect model and evaluated bone regeneration 8weeks post-implantation. The continuous release of bioactive lentiviral vectors (LV-pdgfb) from the scaffolds could be detected for 5days in vitro. In vivo, the released LV-pdgfb transfected adjacent cells and expressed PDGF-BB, facilitating angiogenesis and enhancing bone regeneration. The expression of both pdgfb and the angiogenesis-related genes vWF and VEGFR2 was significantly increased in the pdgfb gene-carrying scaffold (PHp) group. In addition, microCT scanning and histomorphology results proved that there was more new bone ingrowth in the PHp group than in the PLGA/nHA (PH) and control groups. MicroCT parameters, including BMD, BV/TV, Tb.Sp, and Tb.N indicated that there was significantly more new bone formation in the PHp group than in the other groups. With regard to neovascularization, 8weeks post-implantation, blood vessel areas (BVAs) were 9428\u00b1944\u03bcm(2), 4090\u00b1680.3\u03bcm(2), and none in the PHp, PH, and control groups, respectively. At each time point, BVAs in the PHp scaffolds were significantly higher than in the PH scaffolds. To our knowledge, this is the first use of multiphoton microscopy in bone tissue-engineering to investigate angiogenesis in scaffolds in vivo. This method represents a valuable tool for investigating neovascularization in bone scaffolds to determine if a certain scaffold is beneficial to neovascularization. We also proved that delivery of the pdgfb gene alone can improve both angiogenesis and bone regeneration Acronyms.\nReconstruction of critical size bone defects remains a major clinical challenge because of poor bone regeneration, which is usually due to poor angiogenesis during repair. Satisfactory vascularization is a prerequisite for the survival of grafts and the integration of new tissue with existing tissue. In this work, we investigated angiogenesis in 3D scaffolds by in vivo multiphoton microscopy during bone formation in a murine calvarial critical bone defect model and evaluated bone regeneration 8weeks post-implantation. To verify that pdgfb-expressing vectors carried by the scaffolds can promote angiogenesis in 3D-printed scaffolds in vivo, we monitored angiogenesis within the implants by multiphoton microscopy.

Thus, surface modification of bioinert materials is expected to favorably promote osteoblast functions and differentiation. In this context, the objective of this study is to fundamentally elucidate the effect of cell-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) ornamented 3D printed Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds on biological functions, involving cell adhesion, proliferation, and synthesis of vinculin and actin proteins. To mimic the natural ECM environment, the mineralized ECM of osteoblasts was deposited on the Ti-6Al-4V porous scaffolds, fabricated by electron beam melting (EBM) method. The process comprised of osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and freeze-thaw cycles to obtain decellularized extra cellular matrix (dECM), in vitro. The dECM provided a natural environment to restore the natural cell functionality of osteoblasts that were cultured on dECM ornamented Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds. In comparison to the bare Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds, a higher cell functionality such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and growth including cell-cell and cell-material interaction were observed on dECM ornamented Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds, which were characterized by using markers for focal adhesion and cytoskeleton such as vinculin and actin. Moreover, electron microscopy also indicated higher cell-material interaction and enhanced proliferation of cells on dECM ornamented Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds, supported by MTT assay. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our aim with this investigation was to combine the technologies of high-spatial resolution cardiac imaging, image processing software, and fused multi-material 3D printing, to demonstrate that patient-specific models of the mitral valve apparatus could be created to facilitate functional evaluation of novel trans-catheter mitral valve repair strategies. Clinical 3D transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography images were acquired for three patients being evaluated for a catheter-based mitral valve repair. Target anatomies were identified, segmented and reconstructed into 3D patient-specific digital models. For each patient, the mitral valve apparatus was digitally reconstructed from a single or fused imaging data set. Using multi-material 3D printing methods, patient-specific anatomic replicas of the mitral valve were created. 3D print materials were selected based on the mechanical testing of elastomeric TangoPlus materials (Stratasys, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA) and were compared to freshly harvested porcine leaflet tissue. The effective bending modulus of healthy porcine MV tissue was significantly less than the bending modulus of TangoPlus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). All TangoPlus varieties were less stiff than the maximum tensile elastic modulus of mitral valve tissue (3697.2 \u00b1 385.8\u00a0kPa anterior leaflet; 2582.1 \u00b1 374.2\u00a0kPa posterior leaflet) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

This paper demonstrates that it is important to follow the vascular design by nature as close as possible when 3D printing artificial vascular branches. In previous work, the authors developed an algorithm of computational geometry for constructing smooth junctions for 3D printing. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) is used to compare the wall shear stress and blood velocity field for the junctions of different designs. The CFD model can reproduce the expected wall shear stress at locations remote from the junction. For large vessels such as veins, it is shown that ensuring the smoothness of the junction and using smaller joining angles as observed in nature is very important to avoid high wall shear stress and recirculation. The issue is however less significant for capillaries. Large joining angles make no difference to the hemodynamic behavior, which is also consistent with the fact that most capillary junctions have large joining angles.

In addition, water sorption and surface topography were studied.\nThe material used in this study was an epoxy-based resin (Somos WaterShed XC 11122; DSM). Three groups of test specimens (n=10/group) were fabricated using different printing nozzle directions: horizontally, vertically, and at a 45-degree angle to the direction of the long axis of the test specimen. Control specimens were fabricated from an autopolymerizing acrylic resin (Palapress; Heraeus Kultzer GmbH). Water sorption of the 3 test groups was compared. For the 3-point bend test, dry and water stored (14 days) specimens were tested. Flexural strength and flexural modulus were measured. Surface topography was measured with a noncontacting optical profilometer. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey HSD post hoc test was used to analyze the effect of different printing directions and the effect of water storage on the flexural strength and flexural modulus of the material. Two-way ANOVA was also performed to differentiate the effect of the material on flexural strength and flexural modulus (\u03b1=.05).\nThe flexural strength results for the dry test specimen groups were vertical 77.1 MPa, horizontal 73.4 MPa, 45 degrees 78.3 MPa, and control 83.8 MPa. After water sorption, the values were 45.1 MPa, 36.6 MPa, 41.7 MPa, and 80.6 MPa. The flexural moduli for the dry test specimen group were vertical 2.2 GPa, horizontal 2.0 GPa, 45 degrees 2.1 GPa, and control 2.3 GPa. After water sorption, the values were 1.3 GPa, 1.0 GPa, 1.1 GPa, and 2.3 GPa. Weight gain after 14 days of water sorption by group was 1.84% for vertical, 1.80% for horizontal, 1.75% for 45 degrees, and 1.54% for controls.

These HIPEs displayed strong shear thinning behavior that permitted layer-by-layer deposition into complex shapes and adequately high viscosity at low shear for shape retention after extrusion. Each layer was actively polymerized with an ultraviolet cure-on-dispense (CoD) technique and compositions with sufficient viscosity were able to produce tall, complex scaffolds with an internal lattice structure and microscale porosity. Evaluation of the rheological and cure properties indicated that the viscosity and cure rate both played an important role in print fidelity.

LTP enables the solvent-free direct detection of a broad range of molecules and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). The low energy consumption and modest technical requirements of these ion sources favors their employment in mobile applications and as a means to upgrade existing mass analyzers. However, the broad adoption of LTP is hindered by the lack of commercial devices, and constructing personal devices is tricky. Improper setup can result in equipment malfunction or may cause serious damage to instruments due to strong electromagnetic fields or arcing. With this in mind, we developed a reproducible LTP probe, which is designed exclusively from commercial and 3D printed components. The plasma jet generated by the device has a diameter of about 200 \u03bcm, which is satisfactory for the ambient imaging of macroscopic samples. We coupled the 3D-LTP probe to an ion trap analyzer and demonstrated the functionality of the ion source by detecting organic and chemical compounds from pure reference standards, biological substances, and pharmaceutical samples. Molecules were primarily detected in their protonated form or as water/ammonium adducts. The identification of compounds was possible by standard collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation spectra.

The fabrication methods currently available not only need a secondary cell-seeding process and result in severe protein absorption due to the material used, but also have difficulties in providing various cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM) environments for spatial heterogeneity in the organs-on-chips. Therefore, in this research, we introduce a novel 3D bioprinting method for organ-on-a-chip applications. With our novel 3D bioprinting method, it was possible to prepare an organ-on-a-chip in a simple one-step fabrication process. Furthermore, protein absorption on the printed platform was very low, which will lead to accurate measurement of metabolism and drug sensitivity. Moreover, heterotypic cell types and biomaterials were successfully used and positioned at the desired position for various organ-on-a-chip applications, which will promote full mimicry of the natural conditions of the organs. The liver organ was selected for the evaluation of the developed method, and liver function was shown to be significantly enhanced on the liver-on-a-chip, which was prepared by 3D bioprinting. Consequently, the results demonstrate that the suggested 3D bioprinting method is easier and more versatile for production of organs-on-chips.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-06-16", "authors": ["HyungseokLee", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc00450d"}

In this article, a novel approach is developed by plotting the distributions of the average recorded intensity and the average filtered intensity of the Laue patterns. Visualization of the characteristic microstructural features is realized in real time during data collection. As an example, this method is applied to image key features such as microcracks, carbides, heat affected zone, and dendrites in a laser assisted 3D printed Ni-based superalloy, at a speed much faster than data collection.

Lightweight, micro-architected composite SMPs may overcome these size limitations and offer the ability to combine functional properties (e.g., electrical conductivity) with shape memory behavior.

We report thermoset SMP composite inks containing some materials from renewable resources that can be 3D printed into complex, multi-material architectures that exhibit programmable shape changes with temperature and time. Through addition of fiber-based fillers, we demonstrate printing of electrically conductive SMPs where multiple shape states may induce functional changes in a device and that shape changes can be actuated via heating of printed composites.

Covering the huge surface area of such porous titanium with nanotubes has been already shown to result in improved bone regeneration performance and implant fixation. In this study, we loaded TiO2 nanotubes with silver antimicrobial agents to equip them with an additional biofunctionality, i.e., antimicrobial behavior. An optimized anodizing protocol was used to create nanotubes on the entire surface area of direct metal printed porous titanium scaffolds. The nanotubes were then loaded by soaking them in three different concentrations (i.e., 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 M) of AgNO3 solution. The antimicrobial behavior and cell viability of the developed biomaterials were assessed. As far as the early time points (i.e., up to 1 day) are concerned, the biomaterials were found to be extremely effective in preventing biofilm formation and decreasing the number of planktonic bacteria particularly for the middle and high concentrations of silver ions. Interestingly, nanotubes not loaded with antimicrobial agents also showed significantly smaller numbers of adherent bacteria at day 1, which may be attributed to the bactericidal effect of high aspect ratio nanotopographies. The specimens with the highest concentrations of antimicrobial agents adversely affected cell viability at day 1, but this effect is expected to decrease or disappear in the following days as the rate of release of silver ions was observed to markedly decrease within the next few days. The antimicrobial effects of the biomaterials, particularly the ones with the middle and high concentrations of antimicrobial agents, continued until 2 weeks.

We have recently developed a noninvasive registration method, the Surface Template-Assisted Marker Positioning (STAMP) method, which uses a rigid template of the surface of the temporal bone. However, the STAMP method is not applicable when the bony surface is not exposed, such as in endoscopic surgery. Thus, we extended our research to apply the STAMP method onto the skin and tested its feasibility in this study.\nWe designed a phantom made of a rigid box and soft material for the study. The target registration error (TRE) was measured at preset measuring points in the phantom. We modified the STAMP method to be applicable for use on the skin around the ears (S-STAMP). The same phantom was also registered using the conventional, manually scanned surface matching method. We compared the TRE after the different registration methods.\nThe TRE after the S-STAMP registration method was significantly smaller than that of the conventional surface matching method at all error measurement points in the phantom. However, the TRE after the S-STAMP registration method was significantly larger than that of paired point registration using invasive fiducial markers.\nThe S-STAMP method using a rigid template on the soft surface yields a significantly smaller TRE than that of conventional, manually scanned surface matching registration.

Therefore, this work aims to address current limitations regarding inadequate host tissue integration through the use of a novel elastomeric material for three-dimensional (3D) printing biomimetic and bioactive scaffolds. A novel thermoplastic polyurethane-based elastomeric composite filament (Gel-Lay) was used to manufacture porous scaffolds. In an effort to render the scaffolds more bioactive, the flexible scaffolds were subsequently incubated in simulated body fluid at various time points and evaluated for enhanced mechanical properties along with the effects on cell adhesion, proliferation, and 3-week osteogenesis. This work is the first reported use of a novel class of flexible elastomeric materials for the manufacture of 3D printed bioactive scaffold fabrication allowing efficient and effective nucleation of hydroxyapatite (HA) leading to increased nanoscale surface roughness while retaining the bulk geometry of the predesigned structure.

The commonly utilized method for crown attachment - cementation, has been criticized because of recent links between residual cement and peri-implant disease. Residual cement extrusion from crown-abutment margins post-crown seating is a growing concern. This study aimed at (1) identifying key abutment features, which would improve dental cement flow characteristics, and (2) understanding how these features would impact the mechanical stability of the abutment under functional loads. Computational fluid dynamic modeling was used to evaluate cement flow in novel abutment geometries. These models were then evaluated using 3D-printed surrogate models. Finite element analysis also provided an understanding of how the mechanical stability of these abutments was altered after key features were incorporated into the geometry. The findings demonstrated that the key features involved in improved venting of the abutment during crown seating were (1) addition of vents, (2) diameter of the vents, (3) location of the vents, (4) addition of a plastic screw insert, and (5) thickness of the abutment wall. This study culminated in a novel design for a vented abutment consisting of 8 vents located radially around the abutment neck-margin plus a plastic insert to guide the cement during seating and provide retrievability to the abutment system.Venting of the dental abutment has been shown to decrease the risk of undetected residual dental cement post-cement-retained crown seating.

One such method is Electron Beam Melting (EBM), a modern build technology that offers significant potential for lean manufacture and a capability to produce fully dense near-net shaped components.

As such, successful implementation of these technologies requires a comprehensive assessment of the relationships of the key process variables, geometries, resultant microstructures and mechanical properties. The nature of this process suggests that it is often difficult to produce representative test specimens necessary to achieve a full mechanical property characterisation. Therefore, the use of small scale test techniques may be exploited, specifically the small punch (SP) test. The SP test offers a capability for sampling miniaturised test specimens from various discrete locations in a thin-walled component, allowing a full characterisation across a complex geometry.

Here, we prepared a gelatin-carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) hydrogel that cross-linked rapidly (<30 s) by mixing hydrazide-modified gelatin (gelatin-ADH) and aldehyde-modified CMC (CMC-CHO). Vascular endothelial cells encapsulated in the gelatin-CMC hydrogels were viable and sprouted readily, indicating that the hydrogels and their cross-linking reactions were cytocompatible and provided a suitable microenvironment for angiogenesis. Sprouting length of the vascular endothelial cells was modulated by altering the stiffness of the hydrogels and varying the concentrations of the two hydrogel components. Furthermore, we used an electrochemical reaction to detach cells from a gold electrode surface. In this approach, cells that were seeded on a gold surface via the oligopeptide layer, detached rapidly along with the electrochemical desorption of the layer and transferred to the hydrogel. Owing to the rapid gelation of the hydrogels and rapid electrochemical detachment of cells, cell transfer was completed within 10 min (including 30 s of gelation and 5 min of potential application). Rapid cell transfer was observed not only on a flat surface but also on different shapes, such as cylindrical needles. Vascular endothelial cells were transferred from needles onto the hydrogel to fabricate endothelial cell-enveloped microchannels. In subsequent perfusion culture, the transferred endothelial cells migrated and formed luminal structures in the hydrogel.

Although sustained-release formulations exist, an initial burst of drug release is still present and this results in side effects. Zero-order release formulations reduce fluctuations in serum drug concentrations, thereby reducing side effects. Three-dimensional printing can potentially fabricate zero-order release formulations with complex geometries. 3D printed scaffolds with varying hole positions (side and top/bottom), number of holes (4, 8, and 12), and hole diameters (1, 1.5, and 2 mm) were designed. Dissolution tests and high performance liquid chromatography analysis were conducted. Good correlations in the linear release profiles of all carbamazepine-containing scaffolds with side holes (R(2) of at least 0.91) were observed. Increasing the hole diameters (1, 1.5, and 2 mm) resulted in increased rate of drug release in the scaffolds with 4 holes (0.0048, 0.0065, and 0.0074 mg/min) and 12 holes (0.0021, 0.0050, and 0.0092 mg/min), and the initial amount of carbamazepine released in the scaffolds with 8 holes (0.4348, 0.7246, and 1.0246 mg) and 12 holes (0.1995, 0.8598, and 1.4366 mg).

However, it is difficult to achieve the therapeutic concentration at the tumor site with systemic chemotherapy. Numerous local drug delivery systems have been studied to overcome the shortcomings of systemic delivery. However, because most systems involve dissolution of the drug within the carrier, the concentration of the drug is limited to the saturation solubility, and consequently cannot reach the sufficient drug dose. Therefore, we hypothesized that 3D printing of a biodegradable patch incorporated with a high drug concentration would provide a versatile shape to be administered at the exact tumor site as well as an appropriate therapeutic drug concentration with a controlled release. Here, we introduce the 3D-printed patches composed of a blend of poly(lactide-co-glycolide), polycaprolactone, and 5-fluorouracil for delivering the anti-cancer drug in a prolonged controlled manner and therapeutic dose. 3D printing technology can manipulate the geometry of the patch and the drug release kinetics. The patches were flexible, and released the drug over four weeks, and thereby suppressed growth of the subcutaneous pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice with minimized side effects.

FTIR, TGA and SEM analyses confirmed that HA was retained after photocuring and subsequent treatments and was incorporated within the polymerised HIPE (polyHIPE). The addition of HA particles to the polyHIPE caused changes in the mechanical properties of the material. An increase in both the Young's modulus and maximum stress at yield was observed compared with the pure polyHIPE from 1.544\u00b10.231 to 4.614\u00b10.775 and 0.177\u00b10.009 to 0.267\u00b10.034MPa, respectively. Except at very high concentrations, adding HA did not adversely cause the phase separation of the HIPE or the porous microstructure of the resulting polyHIPE. In combination with a photoinitiator, the HIPE emulsion containing HA was investigated as a photocurable resin for stereolithography-based additive manufacturing. The material was readily processable into \"woodpile\" structures via direct-write UV stereolithography, producing scaffolds with multi-scale porosity which may be useful for medical applications such as tissue engineering.

Smooth morphological variations are also frequently seen in nature particularly in bone and cartilage structures and can be inspiring for designing of artificial tissues. In this study, we carried out experimental and numerical procedures to uncover the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of linearly graded porosity scaffolds for two different mathematically defined pore structures. Among TPMS-based scaffolds, P and D surfaces were subjected to gradient modeling to explore the mechanical responses for stretching and bending dominated deformations, respectively. Moreover, the results were compared to their corresponding uniform porosity structures. Mechanical properties were found to be by far greater for the stretching dominated structure (P-Surface). For bending dominated architecture (D-Surface), although there was no global fracture for uniform structures, graded structure showed a brittle fracture at 0.08 strain.

The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of bending axis location on gait performance.\nFor thirteen participants with unilateral ankle muscle weakness, an additive manufacturing framework was used to fabricate passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthosis struts with central and off-center bending axes. Participants walked overground while electromyographic, kinetic and kinematic data were collected for three different bending axes: proximal (high), central (middle) and distal (low), and the participants indicated their order of bending axis preference after testing. Gait measures and preference effect sizes were examined during six regions of the gait cycle.\nA few differences between bending axes were observed: in the first double-leg support peak plantarflexion angle, peak dorsiflexion moment and positive hip work, in the early single-leg support peak knee extension moment and positive ankle and knee work, and in the late single-leg support gastrocnemius activity and vertical ground reaction force impulse. In addition, preference was strongly related to various gait measures.\nDespite the observed statistical differences, altering bending axis location did not produce large and consistent changes in gait performance.

In wound care, collagen-based materials comprise a core gamut of biological dressings and therapeutic strategies. In research, collagen-based materials are employed in everything from 3D cultures to bioprinting. Soluble collagen is well characterized to undergo fibrillation at neutral pH and 37 \u00b0C. To remain stable, a neutralized collagen solution must be maintained at 4 \u00b0C. These physical characteristics of collagen impose limitations on its utility. In our previous work, we identified that the incorporation of a simple polyvinyl alcohol:borate hydrogel could improve the rate of collagen gel fibrillation. In this work we sought to further investigate the interactions of polyvinyl alcohol blend variants, as surfactant-like polymers, in comparison with known non-polymer surfactants. To conduct our investigations scaffold variants were created using increasing concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol, differing combinations of polymers, and non-polymer surfactants Tweens 20 and 80, and TritonX-100. Activation energy for collagen fibrillation was found to significantly decrease in the presence of polyvinyl alcohols (p\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u20090.01) at and above 0.4%w/v concentration. Further, addition of polyvinyl alcohol-graft-polyethylene glycol had the greatest enhancement (2.02 fold) on the fibrillation kinetics (p\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u20090.01), wetting properties and the stability of the collagen scaffolds post-freeze drying. Our results demonstrated that the addition of polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels to a collagen solution could stabilize collagen solution such that the solution could easily be lyophilized (at pH 7) and then reconstituted with water. Cells cultured in polyvinyl alcohol scaffolds also exhibited more organized F-actin, as well as a reduced abundance of pro-collagen and \u03b1-smooth actin.

With the development of 3D printing, it will make great contributions to the reconstruction of vertebrae and intervertebral disc in the future.\n\u4e09\u7ef4\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\"\u7531\u5185\u5411\u5916\"\u7684\u5806\u53e0\u5236\u9020\u7279\u70b9,\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u652f\u67b6\u5236\u9020\u6280\u672f\u6bd4\u8f83,\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5236\u9020\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5236\u9020\u7684\u9aa8\u4e0e\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u652f\u67b6,\u5728\u5916\u5f62\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u80fd\u505a\u5230\u6781\u5ea6\u4eff\u751f\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u4e09\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u5230\u652f\u67b6\u6750\u6599\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u7ec6\u80de\u6216\u7ec6\u80de\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5171\u6c89\u79ef\u3002\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u524d\u6750\u6599\u548c\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9650\u5236,\u4e09\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u6253\u5370\u5c1a\u5904\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u9636\u6bb5,\u652f\u67b6\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5171\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u6781\u5ea6\u4eff\u751f\u7684\u652f\u67b6\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u9aa8\u7f3a\u635f\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u76f8\u4fe1\u968f\u7740\u4e09\u7ef4\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u53d1\u5c55,\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5728\u9aa8\u548c\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "journal": "Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

One emerging field of interest involves the growth of engineered bone tissue in vitro within bioreactors, the most promising of which are perfusion bioreactors. Using bioreactor systems, tissue engineered bone constructs can be fabricated in vitro. However, these engineered constructs lack inherent vasculature and once implanted, quickly develop a necrotic core, where no nutrient exchange occurs. Here, we utilized COMSOL modeling to predict oxygen diffusion gradients throughout aggregated alginate constructs, which allowed for the computer-aided design of printable vascular networks, compatible with any large tissue engineered construct cultured in a perfusion bioreactor. We investigated the effect of 3D printed macroscale vascular networks with various porosities on the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, using both gas-permeable, and non-gas permeable bioreactor growth chamber walls. Through the use of 3D printed vascular structures in conjunction with a tubular perfusion system bioreactor, cell viability was found to increase by as much as 50% in the core of these constructs, with in silico modeling predicting construct viability at steady state.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-06-09", "authors": ["OwenBall", "Bao-Ngoc BNguyen", "Jesse KPlacone", "John PFisher"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-016-1662-y\n10.1089/ten.tea.2015.0395"}
{"title": "Accessible bioprinting: adaptation of a low-cost 3D-printer for precise cell placement and stem cell differentiation.", "abstract": "The precision and repeatability offered by computer-aided design and computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive 'off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, 'luer-lock' syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers.

{"title": "Injectable shear-thinning nanoengineered hydrogels for stem cell delivery.", "abstract": "Injectable hydrogels are investigated for cell encapsulation and delivery as they can shield cells from high shear forces. One of the approaches to obtain injectable hydrogels is to reinforce polymeric networks with high aspect ratio nanoparticles such as two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials. 2D nanomaterials are an emerging class of ultrathin materials with a high degree of anisotropy and they strongly interact with polymers resulting in the formation of shear-thinning hydrogels. Here, we present 2D nanosilicate reinforced kappa-carrageenan (\u03baCA) hydrogels for cellular delivery. \u03baCA is a natural polysaccharide that resembles native glycosaminoglycans and can form brittle hydrogels via ionic crosslinking. The chemical modification of \u03baCA with photocrosslinkable methacrylate groups renders the formation of a covalently crosslinked network (M\u03baCA). Reinforcing the M\u03baCA with 2D nanosilicates results in shear-thinning characteristics, and enhanced mechanical stiffness, elastomeric properties, and physiological stability. The shear-thinning characteristics of nanocomposite hydrogels are investigated for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) delivery. The hMSCs showed high cell viability after injection and encapsulated cells showed a circular morphology.

{"title": "Biofabrication of 3D Alginate-Based Hydrogel for Cancer Research: Comparison of Cell Spreading, Viability, and Adhesion Characteristics of Colorectal HCT116 Tumor Cells.", "abstract": "Hydrogels are an important class of biomaterials as they could mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM). Among the naturally occurring biopolymers, alginate and gelatin are extensively used for many biomedical applications. For developing biofabrication constructs as three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models, realistic imaging of cell spreading and proliferation inside the hydrogels represents a major challenge. Therefore, we aimed to establish a system that can mimic the structural architecture, composition, and biological functions of the ECM for cancer research approaches. For this, we compared the cell behavior of human colon cancer HCT116 cells in two biofabricated hydrogels as follows: pure alginate and cross-linked alginate-gelatin (ADA-GEL) matrixes. Our data indicate that cells from the ADA-GEL matrix showed highest proliferation and cellular networks through the material. Analyzing the mRNA expression of several integrins of cells cultured inside of the matrix, we showed that mRNA expression of integrin subunits differed based on the cell focal adhesion characteristics. Furthermore, we showed that recultured ADA-GEL immobilized cells do not differ from parental HCT116 cells regarding migration and proliferation capabilities. Comparing adhesion and other phenotypic characteristics of HCT116 tumor cells, we suggest that ADA-GEL hydrogel is a more suitable 3D system than pure alginate and seems to optimally mimic the physiological behavior of the tumor microenvironment. For the first time, we present a functional 3D hydrogel construct for colon cancer cells, which are supporting their physiological cell attachment, spreading, and viability. We strongly believe that it will be applicable as a suitable in vitro 3D tumor model to study different aspects of tumor cell behavior.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "The burned ear; possibilities and challenges in framework reconstruction and coverage.", "abstract": "Ear reconstruction remains a challenging procedure, especially in burn victims. The ear is particularly vulnerable to thermal injury because of its location and the thin integument. The thermal injury could subsequently include skin and the deeper located auricular cartilage framework. This type of injury could have long lasting mutilating effect not only because the ear's morphology is mainly related to this framework but also because it will not recover or regenerate once injured. Grafts of costal cartilage or synthetic materials might replace missing cartilage. However, the poor quality of the adjacent skin and subcutaneous tissues makes the reconstruction of a burned ear an even more daunting procedure than congenital or many oncologic indications. As such, regeneration of the skin will be the next step in reconstruction of the burned ear. There is still much development and research to be done, but encouraging results have been shown in tissue engineering of skin and cartilage. Furthermore, 3D (bio)printing of cartilage to facilitate reproduction of the ear's complex shape certainly has potential and might find an interesting role in ear reconstruction. In this review, different clinical challenges and options for ear reconstruction in burn patients are described.

To vanquish these drawbacks, researchers from tissue engineering area are currently using computer-aided design models or medical data to produce 3D scaffolds by Rapid Prototyping (RP). Herein, Tricalcium phosphate (TCP)/Sodium Alginate (SA) scaffolds were produced using RP and subsequently functionalized with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through two different incorporation methods. The obtained results revealed that the composite scaffolds produced by direct incorporation of AgNPs are the most suitable for being used in bone tissue regeneration since they present appropriate mechanical properties, biocompatibility and bactericidal activity.", "journal": "International journal of biological macromolecules", "date": "2016-06-09", "authors": ["Tiago RCorreia", "Daniela RFigueira", "Kevin Dde S\u00e1", "S\u00f3nia PMiguel", "Ricardo GFradique", "Ant\u00f3nio GMendon\u00e7a", "Il\u00eddio JCorreia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.06.004"}
{"title": "Free-Standing Undoped ZnO Microtubes with Rich and Stable Shallow Acceptors.", "abstract": "Fabrication of reliable large-sized p-ZnO is a major challenge to realise ZnO-based electronic device applications. Here we report a novel technique to grow high-quality free-standing undoped acceptor-rich ZnO (A-ZnO) microtubes with dimensions of ~100\u2009\u03bcm (in diameter)\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm (in length) by optical vapour supersaturated precipitation. The A-ZnO exhibits long lifetimes (>1 year) against compensation/lattice-relaxation and the stable shallow acceptors with binding energy of ~127\u2009meV are confirmed from Zn vacancies. The A-ZnO provides a possibility for a mimetic p-n homojunction diode with n(+)-ZnO:Sn. The high concentrations of holes in A-ZnO and electrons in n(+)-ZnO make the dual diffusion possible to form a depletion layer. The diode threshold voltage, turn-on voltage, reverse saturated current and reverse breakdown voltage are 0.72 V, 1.90 V, <10 \u03bcA and >15 V, respectively. The A-ZnO also demonstrates quenching-free donor-acceptor-pairs (DAP) emission located in 390-414\u2009nm with temperature of 270-470\u2009K. Combining the temperature-dependent DAP violet emission with native green emission, the visible luminescence of A-ZnO microtube can be modulated in a wide region of colour space across white light. The present work opens up new opportunities to achieve ZnO with rich and stable acceptors instead of p-ZnO for a variety of potential applications.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-06-07", "authors": ["QiangWang", "YinzhouYan", "YongZeng", "YueLu", "LiangChen", "YijianJiang"], "doi": "10.1038/srep27341"}
{"title": "The Ionic Products from Mineral Trioxide Aggregate-induced Odontogenic Differentiation of Dental Pulp Cells via Activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin Signaling Pathway.", "abstract": "Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been successfully used in clinical applications in endodontics. However, little is known about the involvement of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in human dental pulp cells (hDPC) differentiation with the interaction of MTA in hard tissue regeneration, especially in odontogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore odontogenic/osteogenic gene expression and the protein secretion of hDPCs cultured with consecutive concentrations of MTA extracts and carefully examine the particular molecular mechanism that occurs during this process.\nMTA extracts were prepared by immersing MTA powders into Dulbecco modified Eagle medium at a concentration of 200\u00a0mg/mL. hDPCs were cultured with various concentrations of MTA extracts, and the resulting changes in the cells, such as proliferation and odontogenic differentiation, were measured.\nThe results indicate that hDPC proliferation increases remarkably in a time-dependent manner in most treatment groups, except the highest concentration group (200\u00a0mg/mL). The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway-related genes and proteins are significantly raised when hDPCs are cultured in a wide concentration range of MTA extracts compared with a control, except for the highest concentration group (100\u00a0mg/mL), on days 3 and 7 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nThese variations indicate that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is\u00a0involved in MTA extract-induced odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2016-06-06", "authors": ["Yi-WenChen", "Chia-CheHo", "Tsui-HsienHuang", "Tuan-TiHsu", "Ming-YouShie"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2016.04.019"}
{"title": "Vascularization of three-dimensional engineered tissues for regenerative medicine applications.", "abstract": "Engineering of three-dimensional (3D) tissues is a promising approach for restoring diseased or dysfunctional myocardium with a functional replacement. However, a major bottleneck in this field is the lack of efficient vascularization strategies, because tissue constructs produced in vitro require a constant flow of oxygen and nutrients to maintain viability and functionality. Compared to angiogenic cell therapy and growth factor treatment, bioengineering approaches such as spatial micropatterning, integration of sacrificial materials, tissue decellularization, and 3D bioprinting enable the generation of more precisely controllable neovessel formation. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art approaches to develop 3D tissue engineered constructs with vasculature, and demonstrate how some of these techniques have been applied towards regenerative medicine for treatment of heart failure.\nTissue engineering is a promising approach to replace or restore dysfunctional tissues/organs, but a major bottleneck in realizing its potential is the challenge of creating scalable 3D tissues. Since most 3D engineered tissues require a constant supply of nutrients, it is necessary to integrate functional vasculature within the tissues in order to facilitate the transport of nutrients. To address these needs, researchers are employing biomaterial engineering and design strategies to foster vessel formation within 3D tissues.

CSMA was synthesized by reaction of chondroitin sulfate with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) in dimethylsulfoxide at 50\u00b0C and its degree of methacrylation was tunable up to 48.5%, by changing reaction time and GMA feed. Unlike polymer solutions composed of CSMA alone (20% w/w), mixtures based on 2% w/w of CSMA and 18% of M15P10 showed strain-softening, thermo-sensitive and shear-thinning properties more pronounced than those found for polymer solutions based on M15P10 alone. Additionally, they displayed a yield stress of 19.2\u00b17.0Pa. The 3D printing of this hydrogel resulted in the generation of constructs with tailorable porosity and good handling properties. Finally, embedded chondrogenic cells remained viable and proliferating over a culture period of 6days.

{"title": "Granular gel support-enabled extrusion of three-dimensional alginate and cellular structures.", "abstract": "Freeform fabrication of soft structures has been of great interest in recent years. In particular, it is viewed as a critical step toward the grand vision of organ printing--the on-demand design and fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) human organ constructs for implantation and regenerative medicine. The objective of this study is to develop a novel granular gel support material-enabled, two-step gelation-based 'printing-then-gelation' approach to fabricate 3D alginate structures using filament extrusion. Specifically, a granular Carbopol microgel bath holds the ungelled alginate structure being extruded, avoiding the instantaneous gelation of each printed layer as well as resultant surface tension-induced nozzle clogging. Since Carbopol microgels react with multivalent cations, which are needed for alginate crosslinking, gelatin is introduced as a sacrificial material to make an alginate and gelatin bioink for extrusion, which gels thermally (step-one gelation) to initially stabilize the printed structure for removal from Carbopol. Then gelatin is melted and diffused away while alginate is ionically crosslinked in a 37 \u00b0C calcium chloride bath (step-two gelation), resulting in an alginate structure. The proposed 'printing-then-gelation' approach works for alginate structure fabrication, and it is also applicable for the printing of cellular constructs and other similar homogeneous soft structures using a two-step or even multi-step approach. The main conclusions are: (1) 0.8% (w/v) Carbopol bath with a neutral pH value may be most suitable for soft structure printing; (2) it is most effective to use a 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution to facilitate the removal of residual Carbopol; and (3) alginate structures fabricated using the proposed approach demonstrate better mechanical properties than those fabricated using the conventional 'gelation-while-printing' approach.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-06-04", "authors": ["YifeiJin", "AshleyCompaan", "TapomoyBhattacharjee", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025016"}

{"title": "Methacrylate Polymer Monoliths for Separation Applications.", "abstract": "This review summarizes the development of methacrylate-based polymer monoliths for separation science applications. An introduction to monoliths is presented, followed by the preparation methods and characteristics specific to methacrylate monoliths. Both traditional chemical based syntheses and emerging additive manufacturing methods are presented along with an analysis of the different types of functional groups, which have been utilized with methacrylate monoliths. The role of methacrylate based porous materials in separation science in industrially important chemical and biological separations are discussed, with particular attention given to the most recent developments and challenges associated with these materials.

Here we solidified a novel renewable soybean oil epoxidized acrylate, using a 3D laser printing technique, into smart and highly biocompatible scaffolds capable of supporting growth of multipotent human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Porous scaffolds were readily fabricated by simply adjusting the printer infill density; superficial structures of the polymerized soybean oil epoxidized acrylate were significantly affected by laser frequency and printing speed. Shape memory tests confirmed that the scaffold fixed a temporary shape at -18\u2009\u00b0C and fully recovered its original shape at human body temperature (37\u2009\u00b0C), which indicated the great potential for 4D printing applications. Cytotoxicity analysis proved that the printed scaffolds had significant higher hMSC adhesion and proliferation than traditional polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and had no statistical difference from poly lactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL).

Next, we submit those features to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. Two improvements were proposed for MLP. One improvement is the pruning technique that determines the optimal hidden neuron number.

{"title": "High power microwave source with a three dimensional printed metamaterial slow-wave structure.", "abstract": "For over the last decade, the concept of metamaterials has led to new approaches for considering the interaction of radiation with complex structures. However, practical manifestations of such a device operating at high power densities have proven difficult to achieve due to the resonant nature of metamaterials and the resultant high electric fields, which place severe constraints on manufacturing the slow wave structures. In this paper, we describe the first experimental manifestation of a high power microwave device utilizing a metallic slow wave structure (metamaterial-like) fabricated using additive manufacturing. The feasibility of utilizing additive manufacturing as a technique for building these relatively complicated structures has thus been demonstrated. The MW class microwave source operates in the C-band and shows frequency tunablility with electron beam voltage. The basic electromagnetic characteristics of this device, the construction using additive manufacturing, and the basic performance as a microwave oscillator are considered. Due to the tunable nature of the device, it shows promise not only as an oscillator but also as a microwave amplifier. Therefore, the dispersive characteristics and a discussion of the anticipated gain is included as it relates to an amplifier configuration.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2016-06-03", "authors": ["David MFrench", "DonShiffler"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4950904"}

{"title": "Developmental Design of Synthetic Bacterial Architectures by Morphogenetic Engineering.", "abstract": "Synthetic biology is an emerging scientific field that promotes the standardized manufacturing of biological components without natural equivalents. Its goal is to create artificial living systems that can meet various needs in health care or energy domains. While most works are focused on the individual bacterium as a chemical reactor, our project, SynBioTIC, addresses a novel and more complex challenge: shape engineering; that is, the redesign of natural morphogenesis toward a new kind of developmental 3D printing. Potential applications include organ growth, natural computing in biocircuits, or future vegetal houses. To create in silico multicellular organisms that exhibit specific shapes, we construe their development as an iterative process combining fundamental collective phenomena such as homeostasis, patterning, segmentation, and limb growth. Our numerical experiments rely on the existing Escherichia coli simulator Gro, a physicochemical computation platform offering reaction-diffusion and collision dynamics solvers. The synthetic bioware of our model executes a set of rules, or genome, in each cell. Cells can differentiate into several predefined types associated with specific actions (divide, emit signal, detect signal, die). Transitions between types are triggered by conditions involving internal and external sensors that detect various protein levels inside and around the cell. Indirect communication between bacteria is relayed by morphogen diffusion and the mechanical constraints of 2D packing. Starting from a single bacterium, the overall architecture emerges in a purely endogenous fashion through a series of developmental stages, inlcuding proliferation, differentiation, morphogen diffusion, and synchronization. The genome can be parametrized to control the growth and features of appendages individually. As exemplified by the L and T shapes that we obtain, certain precursor cells can be inhibited while others can create limbs of varying size (divergence of the homology). Such morphogenetic phenotypes open the way to more complex shapes made of a recursive array of core bodies and limbs and, most importantly, to an evolutionary developmental exploration of unplanned functional forms.", "journal": "ACS synthetic biology", "date": "2016-06-01", "authors": ["JonathanPascalie", "MartinPotier", "TarasKowaliw", "Jean-LouisGiavitto", "OlivierMichel", "AntoineSpicher", "Ren\u00e9Doursat"], "doi": "10.1021/acssynbio.5b00246"}
{"title": "High density 3D printed microfluidic valves, pumps, and multiplexers.", "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate that 3D printing with a digital light processor stereolithographic (DLP-SLA) 3D printer can be used to create high density microfluidic devices with active components such as valves and pumps. Leveraging our previous work on optical formulation of inexpensive resins (RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 106621), we demonstrate valves with only 10% of the volume of our original 3D printed valves (Biomicrofluidics, 2015, 9, 016501), which were already the smallest that have been reported. Moreover, we show that incorporation of a thermal initiator in the resin formulation along with a post-print bake can dramatically improve the durability of 3D printed valves up to 1 million actuations. Using two valves and a valve-like displacement chamber (DC), we also create compact 3D printed pumps. With 5-phase actuation and a 15 ms phase interval, we obtain pump flow rates as high as 40 \u03bcL min(-1). We also characterize maximum pump back pressure (i.e., maximum pressure the pump can work against), maximum flow rate (flow rate when there is zero back pressure), and flow rate as a function of the height of the pump outlet. We further demonstrate combining 5 valves and one DC to create a 3-to-2 multiplexer with integrated pump. In addition to serial multiplexing, we also show that the device can operate as a mixer.

{"title": "Characterization of New PEEK/HA Composites with 3D HA Network Fabricated by Extrusion Freeforming.", "abstract": "Addition of bioactive materials such as calcium phosphates or Bioglass, and incorporation of porosity into polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has been identified as an effective approach to improve bone-implant interfaces and osseointegration of PEEK-based devices. In this paper, a novel production technique based on the extrusion freeforming method is proposed that yields a bioactive PEEK/hydroxyapatite (PEEK/HA) composite with a unique configuration in which the bioactive phase (i.e., HA) distribution is computer-controlled within a PEEK matrix. The 100% interconnectivity of the HA network in the biocomposite confers an advantage over alternative forms of other microstructural configurations. Moreover, the technique can be employed to produce porous PEEK structures with controlled pore size and distribution, facilitating greater cellular infiltration and biological integration of PEEK composites within patient tissue. The results of unconfined, uniaxial compressive tests on these new PEEK/HA biocomposites with 40% HA under both static and cyclic mode were promising, showing the composites possess yield and compressive strength within the range of human cortical bone suitable for load bearing applications. In addition, preliminary evidence supporting initial biological safety of the new technique developed is demonstrated in this paper. Sufficient cell attachment, sustained viability in contact with the sample over a seven-day period, evidence of cell bridging and matrix deposition all confirmed excellent biocompatibility.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-05-31", "authors": ["MohammadVaezi", "CameronBlack", "David M RGibbs", "Richard O COreffo", "MarkBrady", "MohamedMoshrefi-Torbati", "ShoufengYang"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules21060687\n10.1002/jbm.a.34286\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.07.013\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.011\n10.1111/os.12098\n10.3390/ijms15045426\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.05.015\n10.1021/am504409q\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.071\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.085\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.054\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.018\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.12.061\n10.1002/ppap.201400149\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.12.030\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.11.030\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00028-0\n10.1016/S0142-1123(03)00080-X\n10.1016/S0266-3538(02)00230-0\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.016\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.031\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2009.07.002\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.08.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.07.028\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00131-5\n10.1243/095441105X9345\n10.1016/j.cirp.2007.05.097\n10.1002/jbm.a.31822\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1097053\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.04.013\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.004\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.12.050\n10.1016/S0921-5093(02)00289-7\n10.1016/j.bone.2011.06.035\n10.1016/j.matlet.2010.06.067\n10.1016/j.msea.2011.01.064\n10.1002/adma.200701372\n10.1002/adma.200803702\n10.1002/adfm.201001746\n10.1038/428386a\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.040\n10.1002/jbm.a.31329\n10.1146/annurev.fl.25.010193.000245\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.04.014\n10.1002/jbm.a.31310\n10.1002/jbm.b.32859\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.09.003\n10.1016/0010-4361(95)92620-R\n10.1016/0266-3538(93)90156-B\n10.1016/0010-4361(90)90435-Y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.02.048\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.11.030\n10.1016/j.triboint.2010.01.020\n10.1007/s10443-010-9147-x\n10.3390/ma5081336\n10.1002/app.39844\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1097054\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1060350\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.12.001\n10.1007/s10856-008-3473-7\n10.1016/j.matdes.2008.03.024\n10.1002/jbm.b.30520\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02907.x\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2009.07.019\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.003"}

Light-sheet microscopy has advanced the field of long-term imaging of live specimens by significantly reducing photo-toxicity and allowing fast acquisition of three-dimensional data over time. However, current light-sheet technology does not allow the imaging of multiple plant specimens in parallel. To achieve higher throughput, we have developed a Multi-sample Arabidopsis Growth and Imaging Chamber (MAGIC) that provides near-physiological imaging conditions and allows high-throughput time-course imaging experiments in the ZEISS Lightsheet Z.1. Here, we illustrate MAGIC's imaging capabilities by following cell divisions, as an indicator of plant growth and development, over prolonged time periods. To automatically quantify the number of cell divisions in long-term experiments, we present a FIJI-based image processing pipeline.

This system involved microdialysis (MD) sampling and fluorescence determination in conjunction with a novel sample derivatization scheme in which glucose oxidase and lactate oxidase were immobilized in ABS flow bioreactors (manufactured through low-cost three-dimensional printing (3DP)), via fused deposition modeling, for online oxidization of sampled glucose and lactate, respectively, in rat brain microdialysate. After optimizing the experimental conditions for MD sampling, the manufacture of the designed flow reactors, the enzyme immobilization procedure, and the online derivatization scheme, the available sampling frequency was 15 h(-1) and the system's detection limits reached as low as 0.060 mM for glucose and 0.059 mM for lactate, based on a 20-\u03bcL conditioned microdialysate; these characteristics were sufficient to reliably determine the concentrations of extracellular glucose and lactate in the brains of living rats. To demonstrate the system's applicability, we performed (i) spike analyses of offline-collected rat brain microdialysate and (ii) in vivo dynamic monitoring of the extracellular glucose and lactate in living rat brains, in addition to triggering neuronal depolarization by perfusing a high-K(+) medium from the implanted MD probe.

Via this algorithm, the spatially-resolved morphological parameters including pore size, pore shape, strut size, surface area, porosity, and interconnectivity were quantified precisely. Fabrication defects and differences between the designed and as-produced scaffolds were clearly identified in both 2D and 3D; the locations and dimensions of each of the fabrication defects were also defined.

Given its scalability, reproducibility, and precise multi-dimensional control that traditional fabrication methods do not provide, 3D bioprinting provides a powerful means to address one of the major challenges in tissue engineering: vascularization. Moderate success of current tissue engineering strategies have been attributed to the current inability to fabricate thick tissue engineering constructs that contain endogenous, engineered vasculature or nutrient channels that can integrate with the host tissue. Successful fabrication of a vascularized tissue construct requires synergy between high throughput, high-resolution bioprinting of larger perfusable channels and instructive bioink that promotes angiogenic sprouting and neovascularization.

Upon plasma electrolytic oxidation of the mesh structure, a thin layer of bioactive titania with pore size 1-3 \u00b5m was nucleated on the surface. The combination of microporous bioactive titania and interconnected porous architecture provided the desired pathway for supply of nutrients and oxygen to cells and tissue and a favorable osteogenic microenvironment for tissue on-growth and in-growth, in relation to the unmodified mesh structure.

The Bio-P3 required an actuating mechanism to manipulate living microtissues of various sizes and shapes that are fragile, and must remain in an aqueous environment. The optical transparency of the Bio-P3 gripping device was essential to provide unobstructed visuals for accurate alignment of microtissues. We previously engineered a pilot fluid force-driven bio-gripper that can pick-and-place microtissue in planar position without causing cellular damage by pulling culture medium through track-etched membrane-integrated cell culture inserts. In this study, we invented a new flexible bio-gripper design that maximized the bio-gripper utilities. We utilized experimental approaches, multivariate analyzes, and theoretical modeling to elucidate how membrane characteristics (pore size, pore density, membrane thickness, membrane area, and surface chemistry) altered bio-gripper robustness and the flow rate (Q(c)) required for successful gripping. We devised two standardized tests and synthetic parts that mimicked microtissues, to systematically quantify bio-gripper performance. All thirteen syringe pump-driven bio-grippers except one successfully gripped and released synthetic parts with values of Q(c) that coincided with our mathematical simulation of the fluid mechanics of gripping. The bio-gripper could grip synthetic parts of various sizes, shapes and masses, demonstrating the robustness of the actuating mechanism. Multivariate analysis of experimental data indicated that both membrane porosity and thickness modulated Q(c), and in addition, revealed that membrane pore density determined membrane optical transparency. Fabricating large tissue constructs requires repeated stacking of microtissues. We showed that one bio-gripper could pick-and-place living microtissues thirty times with Q(c) corresponding to our simulation. Our bio-gripper was capable of stacking and aligning twenty microtissues.

{"title": "The New 3D Printed Left Atrial Appendage Closure with a Novel Holdfast Device: A Pre-Clinical Feasibility Animal Study.", "abstract": "Many patients undergoing cardiac surgery have risk factors for both atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the primary site for thrombi formation. The most severe complication of emboli derived from LAA is stroke, which is associated with a 12-month mortality rate of 38% and a 12-month recurrence rate of 17%. The most common form of treatment for atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention is the pharmacological therapy with anticoagulants. Nonetheless this form of therapy is associated with high risk of major bleeding. Therefore LAA occlusion devices should be tested for their ability to reduce future cerebral ischemic events in patients with high-risk of haemorrhage.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel left atrial appendage exclusion device with a minimally invasive introducer in a swine model.\nA completely novel LAA device, which is composed of two tubes connected together using a specially created bail, was designed using finite element modelling (FEM) to obtain an optimal support force of 36 N at the closure line. The monolithic form of the occluder was obtained by using additive manufacturing of granular PA2200 powder with the technology of selective laser sintering (SLS). Fifteen swine were included in the feasibility tests, with 10 animals undergoing fourteen days of follow-up and 5 animals undergoing long-term observation of 3 months. For one animal, the follow-up was further prolonged to 6 months. The device was placed via minithoracotomy. After the observation period, all of the animals were euthanized, and their hearts were tested for LAA closure and local inflammatory and tissue response.\nAfter the defined observation period, all fifteen hearts were explanted. In all cases the full closure of the LAA was achieved. The macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the explanted hearts showed that all devices were securely integrated in the surrounding tissues. No pericarditis or macroscopic signs of inflammation at the site of the device were found. All pigs were in good condition with normal weight gain and no other clinical symptoms.\nThis novel 3D printed left atrial appendage closure technique with a novel holdfast device was proven to be safe and feasible in all pigs. A benign healing process without inflammation and damage to the surrounding structures or evidence of new thrombi formation was observed. Moreover, the uncomplicated survival and full LAA exclusion in all animals demonstrate the efficacy of this novel and relatively cheap device.

{"title": "A New Approach for On-Demand Generation of Various Oxygen Tensions for In Vitro Hypoxia Models.", "abstract": "The development of in vitro disease models closely mimicking the functions of human disease has captured increasing attention in recent years. Oxygen tensions and gradients play essential roles in modulating biological systems in both physiologic and pathologic events. Thus, controlling oxygen tension is critical for mimicking physiologically relevant in vivo environments for cell, tissue and organ research. We present a new approach for on-demand generation of various oxygen tensions for in vitro hypoxia models. Proof-of-concept prototypes have been developed for conventional cell culture microplate by immobilizing a novel oxygen-consuming biomaterial on the 3D-printed insert. For the first time, rapid (~3.8 minutes to reach 0.5% O2 from 20.9% O2) and precisely controlled oxygen tensions/gradients (2.68 mmHg per 50 \u03bcm distance) were generated by exposing the biocompatible biomaterial to the different depth of cell culture media. In addition, changing the position of 3D-printed inserts with immobilized biomaterials relative to the cultured cells resulted in controllable and rapid changes in oxygen tensions (<130 seconds). Compared to the current technologies, our approach allows enhanced spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of the oxygen tensions. Additionally, it does not interfere with the testing environment while maintaining ease of use. The elegance of oxygen tension manipulation introduced by our new approach will drastically improve control and lower the technological barrier of entry for hypoxia studies. Since the biomaterials can be immobilized in any devices, including microfluidic devices and 3D-printed tissues or organs, it will serve as the basis for a new generation of experimental models previously impossible or very difficult to implement.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["ChunyanLi", "WayneChaung", "CameronMozayan", "RanjeevChabra", "PingWang", "Raj KNarayan"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0155921\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2014.11.003\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124706\n10.1126/science.277.5332.1669\n10.1002/jor.21517\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.09.010\n10.1039/b920401f\n10.1038/nbt.2989\n10.1016/j.tcb.2011.09.005\n10.1039/c3lc50388g\n10.1039/c4lc00853g\n10.1039/c4lc00732h\n10.1039/c2lc40661f\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2014.09.006\n10.1039/c004660d\n10.1039/b816191g\n10.1039/c003558k\n10.1039/b920401f\n10.2478/v10039-009-0042-3\n10.1039/c3lc51360b\n10.1101/gad.1881410\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.021\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.10.002\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01258.x\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.07.007\n10.1039/C1AY05253E\n10.1021/ac403397r\n10.1007/s12272-009-1316-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0061345\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.09.021\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0707587"}
{"title": "3D Printing of Micropatterned Anion Exchange Membranes.", "abstract": "Micropatterned anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have been 3D printed via a photoinitiated free radical polymerization and quaternization process. The photocurable formulation, consisting of diurethane dimethacrylate (DUDA), poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), dipentaerythritol penta-/hexa- acrylate, and 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC), was directly cured into patterned films using a custom 3D photolithographic printing process similar to stereolithography. Measurements of water uptake, permselectivity, and ionic resistance were conducted on the quaternized poly(DUDA-co-PEGDA-co-VBC) sample series to determine their suitability as ion exchange membranes. The water uptake of the polymers increased as the ion exchange capacity (IEC) increased due to greater quaternized VBC content. Samples with IEC values between 0.98 to 1.63 mequiv/g were synthesized by varying the VBC content from 15 to 25 wt %. The water uptake was sensitive to the PEGDA content in the network resulting in water uptake values ranging from 85 to 410 wt % by varying the PEGDA fractions from 0 to 60 wt %. The permselectivity of the AEM samples decreased from 0.91 (168 wt %, 1.63 mequiv/g) to 0.85 (410 wt %, 1.63 mequiv/g) with increasing water uptake and to 0.88 (162 wt %, 0.98 mequiv/g) with decreasing IEC. Permselectivity results were relatively consistent with the general understanding of the correlation between permselectivity, water uptake, and ion content of the membrane. Lastly, it was revealed that the ionic resistance of patterned membranes was lower than that of flat membranes with the same material volume or equivalent thickness. A parallel resistance model was used to explain the influence of patterning on the overall measured ionic resistance. This model may provide a way to maximize ion exchange membrane performance by optimizing surface patterns without chemical modification to the membrane.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["JihoSeo", "Douglas IKushner", "Michael AHickner"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b03455"}

However, PDMS molding involves tedious manual labor, which makes PDMS devices prone to assembly failures and difficult to disseminate to research and clinical settings. Furthermore, the fabrication procedures limit the 3D complexity of the devices to layered designs. Stereolithography (SL), a form of 3D-printing, has recently attracted attention as a way to customize the fabrication of biomedical devices due to its automated, assembly-free 3D fabrication, rapidly decreasing costs, and fast-improving resolution and throughput. However, existing SL resins are not biocompatible and patterning transparent resins at high resolution remains difficult. Here we report procedures for the preparation and patterning of a transparent resin based on low-MW poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (MW 250) (PEG-DA-250). The 3D-printed devices are highly transparent and cells can be cultured on PEG-DA-250 prints for several days.

PLA rough solid supports presenting wells of different shape (i.e. cylindrical, cubic and hemispherical cavities) were designed to accommodate samples of different physical state. The potentials of such supports in terms of sample loading capacity, sensitivity, signal stability were tested by analysing a peptide (i.e. insulin) and an aminoglycoside antibiotic (i.e. gentamicin sulphate) from solution and a chitosan-based gel. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by using a traditional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) support and discussed. By using PLA support on the flat side, signal intensity improved almost twice with respect to PTFE support, whereas with spherical wells a five times improved signal sensitivity and good stability (RSD<6%) were obtained for the analysis of two model molecules. Limits of detection were in the 3-10nM range and linearity was demonstrated for both analytes in the 0.05-0.5\u03bcM range for semi-quantitative or quantitative purposes.

{"title": "Enhanced Mechanical Performance of Bio-Inspired Hybrid Structures Utilising Topological Interlocking Geometry.", "abstract": "Structural composites inspired by nacre have emerged as prime exemplars for guiding materials design of fracture-resistant, rigid hybrid materials. The intricate microstructure of nacre, which combines a hard majority phase with a small fraction of a soft phase, achieves superior mechanical properties compared to its constituents and has generated much interest. However, replicating the hierarchical microstructure of nacre is very challenging, not to mention improving it. In this article, we propose to alter the geometry of the hard building blocks by introducing the concept of topological interlocking. This design principle has previously been shown to provide an inherently brittle material with a remarkable flexural compliance. We now demonstrate that by combining the basic architecture of nacre with topological interlocking of discrete hard building blocks, hybrid materials of a new type can be produced.

Such a technique holds huge potential for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and is currently under extensive investigation. Challenges in this field are mainly related to the paucity of adequate filaments composed of pharmaceutical grade materials, which are needed for feeding the FDM equipment. Accordingly, a number of polymers of common use in pharmaceutical formulation were evaluated as starting materials for fabrication via hot melt extrusion of filaments suitable for FDM processes. By using a twin-screw extruder, filaments based on insoluble (ethylcellulose, Eudragit(\u00ae) RL), promptly soluble (polyethylene oxide, Kollicoat(\u00ae) IR), enteric soluble (Eudragit(\u00ae) L, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate) and swellable/erodible (hydrophilic cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl alcohol, Soluplus(\u00ae)) polymers were successfully produced, and the possibility of employing them for printing 600\u03bcm thick disks was demonstrated. The behavior of disks as barriers when in contact with aqueous fluids was shown consistent with the functional application of the relevant polymeric components.

In spite of its potential processing capability, the direct AM method has several disadvantages such as high cost, poor surface finish of final products, limitation in material selection, high thermal stress, and anisotropic properties of parts. We propose a cost-effective method to manufacture 3D lattice metals. The objective of this study is to provide a detailed protocol on fabrication of 3D lattice metals having a complex shape and a thin wall thickness; e.g., octet truss made of Al and Cu alloys having a unit cell length of 5 mm and a cell wall thickness of 0.5 mm. An overall experimental procedure is divided into eight sections: (a) 3D printing of sacrificial patterns (b) melt-out of support materials (c) removal of residue of support materials (d) pattern assembly (e) investment (f) burn-out of sacrificial patterns (g) centrifugal casting (h) post-processing for final products.

To reach this aim, we engineered a new class of cardiac tissue precursor (CTP), specifically conceived in order to promote the synthesis and the assembly of a cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM). The CTPs were obtained by culturing a mixed cardiac cell population, composed of myocyte and non-myocyte cells, into porous gelatin microspheres in a dynamic bioreactor. By engineering the culture conditions, the CTP developed both beating properties and an endogenous immature cardiac ECM. By following a bottom-up approach, a macrotissue was fabricated by molding and packing the engineered tissue precursor in a maturation chamber. During the macrotissue formation, the tissue precursors acted as cardiac tissue depots by promoting the formation of an endogenous and interconnected cardiac network embedding the cells and the microbeads. The myocytes cell fraction pulled on ECM network and induced its compaction against the internal posts represented by the initial porous microbeads. This reciprocal interplay induced ECM consolidation without the use of external biophysical stimuli by leading to the formation of a beating and endogenous macrotissue. We have thus engineered a new class of cardiac micromodules and show its potential for the fabrication of endogenous cardiac tissue models useful for in vitro studies that involve the cardiac tissue remodeling.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-05-24", "authors": ["ATotaro", "FUrciuolo", "GImparato", "P ANetti"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025014"}

Inserts remained properly positioned and intact throughout testing.

{"title": "A tailored three-dimensionally printable agarose-collagen blend allows encapsulation, spreading, and attachment of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells.", "abstract": "In recent years, novel biofabrication technologies have enabled the rapid manufacture of hydrogel-cell suspensions into tissue-imitating constructs. The development of novel materials for biofabrication still remains a challenge due to a gap between contradicting requirements such as three-dimensional printability and optimal cytocompatibility. We hypothesise that blending of different hydrogels could lead to a novel material with favourable biological and printing properties. In our work, we combined agarose and type I collagen in order to develop a hydrogel blend capable of long-term cell encapsulation of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMCs) and 3D drop-on-demand printing. Different blends were prepared with 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.5% agarose and 0.2% type I collagen. The cell morphology of HUASMCs and the printing accuracy were assessed for each agarose-collagen combination, keeping the content of collagen constant. The hydrogel blend which displayed sufficient cell spreading and printing accuracy (0.5% agarose, 0.2% type I collagen, AGR0.5COLL0.2) was then characterised based on swelling and degradation over 21 days and mechanical stiffness. The cellular response regarding cell attachment of HUASMCs embedded in the hydrogel blend was further studied using SEM, TEM, and TPLSM. Printing trials were fabricated in a drop-on-demand printing process. The swelling and degradation evaluation showed an average of 20% mass loss and less than 10% swelling. AGR0.5COLL0.2 exhibited significant increase in stiffness compared to pure agarose and type I collagen. In addition, columns of AGR0.5COLL0.2 three centimeters in height were successfully printed submerged in cooled perfluorocarbon, proving the intrinsic printability of the hydrogel blend. Ultimately, a promising novel hydrogel blend showing cell spreading and attachment as well as suitability for bioprinting was identified and could, for example, serve in the manufacture of in vitro 3D models to capture more complex features of disease and drug discovery.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-05-21", "authors": ["MariusK\u00f6pf", "Daniela F DuarteCampos", "AndreasBlaeser", "Kshama SSen", "HorstFischer"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025011"}

{"title": "New strategy for enhancing in situ cell viability of cell-printing process via piezoelectric transducer-assisted three-dimensional printing.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering has become one of the great applications of three-dimensional cell printing because of the possibility of fabricating complex cell-laden scaffolds. Three typical methods (inkjet, micro-extrusion, and laser-assisted bio-printing) have been used to fabricate structures. Of these, micro-extrusion is a comparatively easy method, but has some drawbacks such as low in situ cell viability after fabricating cell-laden structures because of the high wall shear stress in micro-sized nozzles. To overcome this shortcoming, we suggest an innovative cell printing method, which is assisted by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). The PZT assistance in the dispensing process enhances the printing efficiency and cell viability by decreasing the wall shear stress within a nozzle because the PZT effect can lower the shear viscosity of the bioink via micro-scale vibration. In this study, 5 wt% cell-laden alginate was used as a bioink, and various PZT conditions (frequencies up to \u223c400 Hz and amplitudes up to \u223c40.5 \u03bcm) were simultaneously applied to the cell-printing process to examine the effectiveness of the PZT.

{"title": "TRIO Platform: A Novel Low Profile In vivo Imaging Support and Restraint System for Mice.", "abstract": "High resolution, in vivo optical imaging of the mouse brain over time often requires anesthesia, which necessitates maintaining the animal's body temperature and level of anesthesia, as well as securing the head in an optimal, stable position. Controlling each parameter usually requires using multiple systems. Assembling multiple components into the small space on a standard microscope stage can be difficult and some commercially available parts simply do not fit. Furthermore, it is time-consuming to position an animal in the identical position over multiple imaging sessions for longitudinal studies. This is especially true when using an implanted gradient index (GRIN) lens for deep brain imaging. The multiphoton laser beam must be parallel with the shaft of the lens because even a slight tilt of the lens can degrade image quality. In response to these challenges, we have designed a compact, integrated in vivo imaging support system to overcome the problems created by using separate systems during optical imaging in mice. It is a single platform that provides (1) sturdy head fixation, (2) an integrated gas anesthesia mask, and (3) safe warm water heating. This THREE-IN-ONE (TRIO) Platform has a small footprint and a low profile that positions a mouse's head only 20 mm above the microscope stage. This height is about one half to one third the height of most commercially available immobilization devices. We have successfully employed this system, using isoflurane in over 40 imaging sessions with an average of 2 h per session with no leaks or other malfunctions. Due to its smaller size, the TRIO Platform can be used with a wider range of upright microscopes and stages. Most of the components were designed in SOLIDWORKS\u00ae and fabricated using a 3D printer.

{"title": "Thermodynamic Destabilization of Ti-O Solid Solution by H2 and Deoxygenation of Ti Using Mg.", "abstract": "Reactive metals including Ti, Zr, Hf, and V, among others, have a strong chemical affinity to oxygen, which makes them difficult to produce and costly to use. It is especially challenging to produce pure or metal alloy powders of these elements when extremely low oxygen content is required, because they have high solubility for oxygen, and the solid solution of these metals with oxygen is often more stable thermodynamically than their oxides. We report a novel thermochemical approach to destabilize Ti(O) solid solutions using hydrogen, thus enabling deoxygenation of Ti powder using Mg, which has not been possible before because of the thermodynamic stability of Ti(O) solid solutions relative to MgO. The work on Ti serves as an example for other reactive metals. Both analytical modeling and experimental results show that hydrogen can indeed increase the oxygen potential of Ti-O solid solution alloys; in other words, the stability of Ti-O solid solutions is effectively decreased, thus increasing the thermodynamic driving force for Mg to react with oxygen in Ti. Because hydrogen can be easily removed from Ti by a simple heat treatment, it is used only as a temporary alloying element to destabilize the Ti-O systems. The thermodynamic approach described here is a breakthrough and is applicable to a range of different materials.

Total disease duration ranged from 6 to 168 months (mean\u200a=\u200a33.6 months). The size of skull defects ranged from 84\u200a\u00d7\u200a104 to 154\u200a\u00d7\u200a193\u200amm. Custom-made implants were manufactured by Medyssey Co, Ltd (Jecheon, South Korea) using 3D computed tomography data, Mimics software, and an electron beam melting machine. The team reviewed several different designs and simulated surgery using a 3D skull model. During the operation, the implant was fit to the defect without dead space. Operation times ranged from 85 to 180 minutes (mean\u200a=\u200a115.7\u200aminutes). Operative sites healed without any complications except for 1 patient who had red swelling with exudation at the skin defect, which was a skin infection and defect at the center of the scalp flap reoccurring since the initial head injury. This patient underwent reoperation for skin defect revision and replacement of the implant. Twenty-one patients were followed for 6 to 24 months (mean\u200a=\u200a14.1 months). The patients were satisfied and had no recurrent wound problems. Head computed tomography after operation showed good fixation of titanium implants and satisfactory skull-shape symmetry. For the reconstruction of skull defects, the use of autologous bone grafts has been the treatment of choice. However, bone use depends on availability, defect size, and donor morbidity. As 3D printing techniques are further advanced, it is becoming possible to manufacture custom-made 3D titanium implants for skull reconstruction.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2016-05-19", "authors": ["Eun-KyungPark", "Jun-YoungLim", "In-SikYun", "Ju-SeongKim", "Su-HeonWoo", "Dong-SeokKim", "Kyu-WonShim"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000002656"}

Previous studies have demonstrated that using a polymer gel dosimeter requires a 24 h reaction time to stabilize and further evaluate the measured dose distribution in two-dimensional dosimetry. In this study, the short-term stability within 24 h and feasibility of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) polymer gel dosimeters for use in three-dimensional dosimetry were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). NIPAM gels were used to measure the dose volume in a clinical case of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). For dose readouts, MR images of irradiated NIPAM gel phantoms were acquired at 2, 5, 12, and 24 h after dose delivery. The mean standard errors of dose conversion from using dose calibration curves (DRC) were calculated. The measured dose volumes at the four time points were compared with those calculated using a treatment planning system (TPS). The mean standard errors of the dose conversion from using the DRCs were lower than 1 Gy. Mean pass rates of 2, 5, 12, and 24 h axial dose maps calculated using gamma evaluation with 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement criteria were 83.5% \u00b1 0.9%, 85.9% \u00b1 0.6%, 98.7% \u00b1 0.3%, and 98.5% \u00b1 0.9%, respectively. Compared with the dose volume histogram of the TPS, the absolute mean relative volume differences of the 2, 5, 12, and 24 h measured dose volumes were lower than 1% for the irradiated region with an absorbed dose higher than 2.8 Gy.

To this end, this study implements a multimodal approach for the promotion of vessel-like structures formation in stiff fibrin hydrogels. Computational simulations have been performed to identify the easiest microchanneled configuration assuring normoxic conditions throughout thick cylindrical hydrogels (8 mm height, 6 mm \u2205), showing that in our configuration a minimum of three microchannels (600 \u03bcm \u2205), placed in a non-planar disposition, is required. Using small hydrogel bricks with oxygen distribution equal to the microchanneled configuration, this study demonstrates that among different culture conditions, co-culture of mesenchymal and endothelial cells supplemented with ANG-1 and VEGF leads to the most developed vascular network. Microchanneled hydrogels have been then cultured in the same conditions both statically and in a bioreactor for 7 d. Unexpectedly, the combination between shear forces and normoxic conditions is unable to promote microvascular networks formation in three-channeled hydrogels. Differently, application of either shear forces or normoxic conditions alone results in microvessels outgrowth. These results suggest that to induce angiogenesis in engineered constructs, complex interactions between several biochemical and biophysical parameters have to be modulated.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2016-05-19", "authors": ["ChiaraArrigoni", "MatildeBongio", "GiuseppeTal\u00f2", "SimoneBersini", "JunkoEnomoto", "JunjiFukuda", "MatteoMoretti"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500958"}

With the advent of advanced tissue engineering techniques, great strides have been made toward manufacturing replacement tissues and\u00a0organs, including the intestine, which aim to avoid transplant-related complications. The current paradigm is to seed a biocompatible support material (scaffold) with a desired cell population to generate viable replacement tissue. Although this technique has now been extended by the three-dimensional (3D) printing of geometrically complex scaffolds, the overall approach is hindered by relatively slow turnover and negative effects of residual scaffold material, which affects final clinical outcome. Methods recently developed for scaffold-free 3D bioprinting may overcome such obstacles and should allow for rapid manufacture and deployment of \"bioprinted organs.\" Much work remains before 3D bioprinted tissues can enter clinical use.

{"title": "3D scanning and 3D printing as innovative technologies for fabricating personalized topical drug delivery systems.", "abstract": "Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory skin disease with high prevalence. In this work, the potential of 3D printing to produce flexible personalised-shape anti-acne drug (salicylic acid) loaded devices was demonstrated by two different 3D printing (3DP) technologies: Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and stereolithography (SLA). 3D scanning technology was used to obtain a 3D model of a nose adapted to the morphology of an individual. In FDM 3DP, commercially produced Flex EcoPLA\u2122 (FPLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) filaments were loaded with salicylic acid by hot melt extrusion (HME) (theoretical drug loading - 2% w/w) and used as feedstock material for 3D printing. Drug loading in the FPLA-salicylic acid and PCL-salicylic acid 3D printed patches was 0.4% w/w and 1.2% w/w respectively, indicating significant thermal degradation of drug during HME and 3D printing. Diffusion testing in Franz cells using a synthetic membrane revealed that the drug loaded printed samples released <187\u03bcg/cm(2) within 3h. FPLA-salicylic acid filament was successfully printed as a nose-shape mask by FDM 3DP, but the PCL-salicylic acid filament was not. In the SLA printing process, the drug was dissolved in different mixtures of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) that were solidified by the action of a laser beam. SLA printing led to 3D printed devices (nose-shape) with higher resolution and higher drug loading (1.9% w/w) than FDM, with no drug degradation. The results of drug diffusion tests revealed that drug diffusion was faster than with the FDM devices, 229 and 291\u03bcg/cm(2) within 3h for the two formulations evaluated. In this study, SLA printing was the more appropriate 3D printing technology to manufacture anti-acne devices with salicylic acid.

However, to generate a successful 3D bone tissue engineering construct, additional complexities should be taken into account such as nutrient and oxygen delivery, which is often insufficient after implantation in large bone defects. We propose that a well-designed tissue engineering construct, that is, an implant with a specific spatial pattern of cells in a matrix, will improve the healing outcome. By using a computational model of bone regeneration we show that particular cell patterns in tissue engineering constructs are able to enhance bone regeneration compared to uniform ones. We successfully bioprinted one of the most promising cell-gradient patterns by using cell-laden hydrogels with varying cell densities and observed a high cell viability for three days following the bioprinting process. In summary, we present a novel strategy for the biofabrication of bone tissue engineering constructs by designing cell-gradient patterns based on a computational model of bone regeneration, and successfully bioprinting the chosen design. This integrated approach may increase the success rate of implanted tissue engineering constructs for critical size bone defects and also can find a wider application in the biofabrication of other types of tissue engineering constructs.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-05-18", "authors": ["Aur\u00e9lieCarlier", "G\u00f6zde AkdenizSkvortsov", "ForoughHafezi", "EleonoraFerraris", "JenniferPatterson", "BahattinKo\u00e7", "HansVan Oosterwyck"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025009"}

However, little is known about maintaining the integrity of ECs in in vitro systems. Here we describe polycaprolactone nanofibrous membranes coated with collagen gel that overcome many limitations of conventional nanofibers used for engineering endothelia. We investigated cell-cell and cell-ECM junctional complexes using collagen-coated and conventional nanofibrous membranes. Conventional nanofibrous membranes alone did not form a monolayer with ECs, whereas collagen-coated nanofibrous membranes did. Several concentrations of collagen in the gel coating promoted the formation of cell-cell junctional complexes, facilitated the deposition of laminin, and increased the focal contact organization of ECs.

In a porous biomaterial, a geometric mismatch can result in pore occlusion and strut thinning, drawbacks that can inherently compromise bone ingrowth and severely impact mechanical performance. This paper focuses on Selective Laser Melting of porous microarchitecture and proposes a compensation scheme that reduces the morphology mismatch between as-designed and as-manufactured geometry, in particular that of the pore. A spider web analog is introduced, built out of Ti-6Al-4V powder via SLM, and morphologically characterized. Results from error analysis of strut thickness are used to generate thickness compensation relations expressed as a function of the angle each strut formed with the build plane. The scheme is applied to fabricate a set of three-dimensional porous biomaterials, which are morphologically and mechanically characterized via micro Computed Tomography, mechanically tested and numerically analyzed. For strut thickness, the results show the largest mismatch (60% from the design) occurring for horizontal members, reduces to 3.1% upon application of the compensation.

{"title": "A lightweight, biological structure with tailored stiffness: The feather vane.", "abstract": "The flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty. Thus, their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift, stiffness, aerodynamics, and damage resistance. This design involves two main parts: a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air. Within the feather vane, barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs, forming a flat surface which ensures lift. Microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together, providing the close-knit, unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un-hooked junctions. Both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior. The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling. We compare the flexure of single barbs as well as arrays of barbs and find that the interlocking adherence of barbs to one another enables a more robust structure due to minimized barb rotation during deflection. Thus, the flexure behavior of the feather vane can be tailored by the adhesive hooking between barbs, creating a system that mitigates damage. A simplified three-dimensional physical model for this interlocking mechanism is constructed by additive manufacturing. The exceptional architecture of the feather vane will motivate the design of bioinspired structures with tailored and unique properties ranging from adhesives to aerospace materials.\nDespite its importance to bird flight, literature characterizing the feather vane is extremely limited. The feather vane is composed of barbs that branch from the main shaft (rachis) and barbules that branch from barbs. In this study, the flexural behavior of the feather barb and the role of barbule connections in reinforcing the feather vane are quantitatively investigated for the first time, both experimentally and theoretically. Through the performed experiments, structure-function relationships within the feather vane are uncovered. Additionally, in the proposed model the sophisticated structure of the barbs and the interlocking mechanism of the feather vane are simplified to understand these processes in order to engineer new lightweight structures and adhesives.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-05-18", "authors": ["Tarah NSullivan", "Andre\u00efPissarenko", "Steven AHerrera", "DavidKisailus", "Vlado ALubarda", "Marc AMeyers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.05.022"}

Prostheses were prepared by applying wax to the implant abutment. Shapes were copied using putty. IIRs were fabricated from poly(methyl methacrylate) for a conventional system with thermoplastic resin (CTR, n=40), a 4-axial milling machine with a crown-designed standard template library for a subtractive manufacturing system with Pekkton milling (SPM, n=40), and a 3-dimensional printer for an additive manufacturing system with digital light processing (ADL, n=40).

Results were analyzed with nonparametric 2-way analysis of variance using rank-transformed values and Tukey post hoc test (\u03b1=.05).\nThe fabricated IIRs were significantly different at all points (P<.001). Moreover, ADL was superior to CTR and SPM. IIRs were significantly different only at the intermarginal discrepancy (the vertical discrepancy between the crown and the point where the margin becomes round and changes to the axial wall), the axiogingival discrepancy (the vertical discrepancy between the internal surface and the axial wall adjacent to the gingival wall of the abutment), and the occlusal discrepancy (the vertical discrepancy between the occlusal wall of the abutment and the internal surface; this discrepancy comprises the internal discrepancy; P<.001).

We investigated the impact of semi-automated cardiovascular-specific segmentation software on time and reproducibility of segmentation. Magnetic resonance angiograms (MRAs) of 19 patients undergoing intervention for right ventricular outflow lesions were segmented to demonstrate the right heart. STLs were created by two independent clinicians using semi-automated cardiovascular segmentation (SAS) and traditional manual segmentation (MS). Time was recorded and geometric STL disagreement was determined (0\u2009%\u2009=\u2009no disagreement, 100\u2009%\u2009=\u2009complete disagreement). MRA datasets were categorized as clean when only right heart structures were present in the MRA, or contaminated when left heart structures were also present and required removal. Eighteen (seven clean and 11 contaminated) cases were successfully segmented with both methods.

We tried to develop an optimal 3D printing model of hepatic segments as a teaching aid to improve the teaching of hepatic segments.\nA fresh human cadaveric liver without hepatic disease was CT scanned. After 3D reconstruction, three types of 3D computer models of hepatic structures were designed and 3D printed as models of hepatic segments without parenchyma (type 1) and with transparent parenchyma (type 2), and hepatic ducts with segmental partitions (type 3). These models were evaluated by six experts using a five-point Likert scale. Ninety two medical freshmen were randomized into four groups to learn hepatic segments with the aid of the three types of models and traditional anatomic atlas (TAA). Their results of two quizzes were compared to evaluate the teaching effects of the four methods.\nThree types of models were successful produced which displayed the structures of hepatic segments. By experts' evaluation, type 3 model was better than type 1 and 2 models in anatomical condition, type 2 and 3 models were better than type 1 model in tactility, and type 3 model was better than type 1 model in overall satisfaction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

This study investigated whether hydrogels based on the polymer mentioned above with a 10% degree of methacrylation (M10P10) support cartilage formation by chondrocytes and whether the incorporation of methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (CSMA) or methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) can improve the mechanical properties, long-term stability, and printability. Chondrocyte-laden M10P10 hydrogels were cultured for 42 days to evaluate chondrogenesis. M10P10 hydrogels with or without polysaccharides were evaluated for their mechanical properties (before and after UV photo-cross-linking), degradation kinetics, and printability. Extensive cartilage matrix production occurred in M10P10 hydrogels, highlighting their potential for cartilage repair strategies. The incorporation of polysaccharides increased the storage modulus of polymer mixtures and decreased the degradation kinetics in cross-linked hydrogels.

In this review, we highlight recent advances in 3D printing of tissue engineered constructs that recapitulate the physical and cellular properties of the tissue microenvironment for investigating mechanisms of disease progression and for screening drugs.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-05-14", "authors": ["JosephVanderburgh", "Julie ASterling", "Scott AGuelcher"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-016-1640-4\n10.1002/adhm.201500721"}

The self-assembling abilities of low molecular weight peptides make them ideal for designing advanced materials using mild reaction conditions. In this work, a biocatalytic approach has been used for the synthesis of an Fmoc-tripeptide that is able to self-assemble in water affording a self-supporting hydrogel. The mechanical properties of this material have been enhanced through chemical crosslinking by using a natural compound, genipin, that allows to minimize cytotoxic effects. Moreover, we have tested the potential of the prepared materials to be employed as drug delivery systems using naproxen as an anti-inflammatory model drug, and studying its release kinetics in aqueous medium.

Current heart valve replacements are associated with several limitations due to their nonviable nature. In this regard, heart valve tissue engineering has shown to represent a promising concept in order to overcome these limitations and replace diseased cardiac valves with living, autologous constructs. These bioengineered valves hold potential for in situ remodeling, growth, and repair throughout the patient's lifetime without the risk of thromboembolic complications and adverse immune responses. For the fabrication of tissue-engineered heart valves, several concepts have been established, the \"classical\" in vitro tissue engineering approach, the in situ tissue engineering approach, and alternative approaches including three-dimensional printing and electrospinning.

{"title": "Bioprinting Cellularized Constructs Using a Tissue-specific Hydrogel Bioink.", "abstract": "Bioprinting has emerged as a versatile biofabrication approach for creating tissue engineered organ constructs. These constructs have potential use as organ replacements for implantation in patients, and also, when created on a smaller size scale as model \"organoids\" that can be used in in vitro systems for drug and toxicology screening. Despite development of a wide variety of bioprinting devices, application of bioprinting technology can be limited by the availability of materials that both expedite bioprinting procedures and support cell viability and function by providing tissue-specific cues. Here we describe a versatile hyaluronic acid (HA) and gelatin-based hydrogel system comprised of a multi-crosslinker, 2-stage crosslinking protocol, which can provide tissue specific biochemical signals and mimic the mechanical properties of in vivo tissues. Biochemical factors are provided by incorporating tissue-derived extracellular matrix materials, which include potent growth factors. Tissue mechanical properties are controlled combinations of PEG-based crosslinkers with varying molecular weights, geometries (linear or multi-arm), and functional groups to yield extrudable bioinks and final construct shear stiffness values over a wide range (100 Pa to 20 kPa). Using these parameters, hydrogel bioinks were used to bioprint primary liver spheroids in a liver-specific bioink to create in vitro liver constructs with high cell viability and measurable functional albumin and urea output.

In the bioprinting process, cells are subject to process-induced forces (such as shear force) that can result in cell damage and loss of cell function.

This study used a rheometer to examine the flow behavior of alginate solution and alginate-Schwann cell (RSC96), alginate-fibroblast cell (NIH-3T3), and alginate-skeletal muscle cell (L8) suspensions during shearing with respect to effects on cell viability and proliferation. The flow behavior of all the alginate-cell suspensions varied with alginate concentration and cell density and had a significant influence on the viability and proliferation of the cells once sheared as well as on the recovery of the sheared cells.

In addition, 3D bioprinting by stereolithography allows fabrication of internal pores and defined macroscopic shapes. In this study, we formulated a hybrid biocompatible resin using natural and synthetic polymers (chitosan and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), respectively) by controlling molecular weight of chitosan, feed-ratios, and photo-initiator concentration. Ear-shaped, hybrid scaffolds were fabricated by a stereolithographic method using a 405\u00a0nm laser. Hybrid hydrogel scaffolds of chitosan (50-190\u00a0kDa) and PEGDA (575\u00a0Da) were mixed at varying feed-ratios. Some of the cationic, amino groups of chitosan were neutralized by dialysis in acidic solution containing chitosan in excess of sodium acetate solution to inhibit quenching of newly formed photoradicals. A feed-ratio of 1:7.5 was found to be the most appropriate of the formulations considered in this study in terms of mechanical properties, cell adhesion, and printability. The biofabricated hybrid scaffold showed interconnected, homogeneous pores with a nominal pore size of 50\u00a0\u00b5m and an elastic modulus of\u00a0~400\u00a0kPa. Moreover, long-term cell viability and cell spreading was observed via actin filament staining. Printability of the biocompatible resin was confirmed by printing thresholded MR images of an ear and the feed ratio of 1:7.5 provided the most faithful reproduction of the shape.

Alignment of self-assembly cell spheroids that are used as bioink could be very accurate after droplet ejection from bioprinter. Complex and heterogeneous tissue structures could be built using rapid additive manufacture technology and multiple cell lines. Effective vascularization in the engineered tissue samples is critical in any clinical application. In this review paper, the current technologies and processing steps (such as printing, preparation of bioink, cross-linking, tissue fusion and maturation) in 3D bio-printing are introduced, and their specifications are compared with each other. In addition, the application of ultrasound in this novel field is also introduced. Cells experience acoustic radiation force in ultrasound standing wave field (USWF) and then accumulate at the pressure node at low acoustic pressure. Formation of cell spheroids by this method is within minutes with uniform size and homogeneous cell distribution. Neovessel formation from USWF-induced endothelial cell spheroids is significant. Low-intensity ultrasound could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Its use is at low cost and compatible with current bioreactor.

{"title": "Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging of pharmaceuticals in microfluidic devices.", "abstract": "The poor aqueous solubility of many active pharmaceutical ingredients presents challenges for effective drug delivery. In this study, the combination of attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopic imaging with specifically designed polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices to study drug release from pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. First, the high-throughput analysis of the dissolution of micro-formulations studied under flowing conditions has been introduced using a model formulation of ibuprofen and polyethylene glycol. The behaviour and release of the drug was monitored in situ under different pH conditions. In contrast to the neutral solution, where both the drug and excipient dissolved at a similar rate, structural change from the molecularly dispersed to a crystalline form of ibuprofen was characterised in the obtained spectroscopic images and the corresponding ATR-FTIR spectra for the experiments carried out in the acidic medium. Further investigations into the behaviour of the drug after its release from formulations (i.e., dissolved drug) were also undertaken. Different solutions of sodium ibuprofen dissolved in a neutral medium were studied upon contact with acidic conditions. The phase transition from a dissolved species of sodium ibuprofen to the formation of solid crystalline ibuprofen was revealed in the microfluidic channels. This innovative approach could offer a promising platform for high-throughput analysis of a range of micro-formulations, which are of current interest due to the advent of 3D printed pharmaceutical and microparticulate delivery systems.

Digital technologies such as computer numerical control (CNC) milling and 3-dimensional (3D) printing have been used to prepare molds directly or indirectly into which a biocompatible pigmented silicone elastomer is placed.\nThe purpose of this in\u00a0vitro study was to develop a silicone elastomer by varying composition that could eventually be 3D printed directly without a mold to create facial/body prostheses.\nThe silicone was composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), filler, catalyst, and cross-linker. Four types of base silicone polymers were prepared with different PDMS molecular weight combinations with long, medium, and short chain length PDMS. The effect of the cross-linker (2.5% to 12.5%) content in these bases was assessed for the effect upon the mechanical properties of the elastomer. Ten readings were made for each formulation, and differences in the means were evaluated with a 2-way ANOVA (\u03b1=.05).\nVariations in silicone composition resulted in hardness from 6.8 to 28.5 durometer, tensile strength from 0.720 to 3.524 kNm\nThe optimum combination of mechanical properties implies the use of one of these formulations for further evaluation in a 3D printer capable of actively mixing and extruding 2-component, room temperature vulcanization silicone.", "journal": "The Journal of prosthetic dentistry", "date": "2016-05-10", "authors": ["Swati KJindal", "MartynSherriff", "Mark GWaters", "Trevor JCoward"], "doi": "10.1016/j.prosdent.2016.02.020"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the material characterization, cell viability, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory abilities of the hinokitiol-modified calcium silicate (CS) cement as a root end filling material. The setting times, diametral tensile strength (DTS) values and XRD patterns of CS cements with 0-10mM hinokitiol were examined. Then, the antibacterial effect and the expression levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) of the hinokitiol-modified CS cements were evaluated. Furthermore, the cytocompatibility, the expression levels of the markers of odontoblastic differentiation, mineralized nodule formation and calcium deposition of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) cultured on hinokitiol-modified CS cements were determined. The hinokitiol-modified CS cements had better antibacterial and anti-inflammatory abilities and cytocompatibility than non-modified CS cements. Otherwise, the hinokitiol-modified CS cements had suitable setting times and better odontoblastic potential of hDPCs. Previous report pointed out that the root-end filling materials may induce inflammatory cytokines reaction. In our study, hinokitiol-modified CS cements not only inhibited the expression level of inflammatory cytokines, but also had better cytocompatibility, antimicrobial properties and active ability of odontoblastic differentiation of hDPCs.

{"title": "Stochastic Assembly of Bacteria in Microwell Arrays Reveals the Importance of Confinement in Community Development.", "abstract": "The structure and function of microbial communities is deeply influenced by the physical and chemical architecture of the local microenvironment and the abundance of its community members. The complexity of this natural parameter space has made characterization of the key drivers of community development difficult. In order to facilitate these characterizations, we have developed a microwell platform designed to screen microbial growth and interactions across a wide variety of physical and initial conditions. Assembly of microbial communities into microwells was achieved using a novel biofabrication method that exploits well feature sizes for control of innoculum levels. Wells with incrementally smaller size features created populations with increasingly larger variations in inoculum levels. This allowed for reproducible growth measurement in large (20 \u03bcm diameter) wells, and screening for favorable growth conditions in small (5, 10 \u03bcm diameter) wells. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for screening and discovery using 5 \u03bcm wells to assemble P. aeruginosa colonies across a broad distribution of innoculum levels, and identify those conditions that promote the highest probability of survivial and growth under spatial confinement. Multi-member community assembly was also characterized to demonstrate the broad potential of this platform for studying the role of member abundance on microbial competition, mutualism and community succession.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-05-07", "authors": ["Ryan HHansen", "Andrea CTimm", "Collin MTimm", "Amber NBible", "Jennifer LMorrell-Falvey", "Dale APelletier", "Michael LSimpson", "Mitchel JDoktycz", "Scott TRetterer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0155080\n10.1073/pnas.0607651104\n10.1073/pnas.1319175111\n10.1038/nrmicro3185\n10.1038/nchembio.749\n10.1073/pnas.1300321110\n10.1557/mrs.2011.65\n10.1007/s12275-014-4067-3\n10.1126/science.1251821\n10.1073/pnas.1219662110\n10.1002/anie.200901550\n10.1073/pnas.0607971103\n10.1039/b911230h\n10.1073/pnas.1309729110\n10.1073/pnas.1324044111\n10.1146/annurev.micro.030608.101423\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017019\n10.1073/pnas.0807935105\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.002\n10.1039/B804911D\n10.1021/cb100336p\n10.1039/C2LC21284F\n10.1073/pnas.1106752109\n10.1063/1.4765337\n10.1039/C0LC00114G\n10.1073/pnas.0701693104\n10.3390/ma3031803\n10.1023/A:1009911407093\n10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74725-0\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.02.012\n10.1063/1.4935938\n10.1038/nature12155\n10.1007/s10439-012-0658-5\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070511-155012\n10.1021/bm4011358\n10.3390/bios4010063\n10.1039/c3sm52419a\n10.1039/c1lc20561g\n10.1038/nprot.2011.432\n10.1023/A:1010698225362\n10.1073/pnas.1213963109\n10.1016/j.tim.2014.05.007"}

{"title": "Effect of calcium phosphate ceramic substrate geometry on mesenchymal stromal cell organization and osteogenic differentiation.", "abstract": "The composition of calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramics in combination with surface features have been shown to influence biological performance, and micro- and nano-scale topography is known to stimulate osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). In view of this, adipose tissue derived MSCs were cultured on CaP disks featuring hemispherical concavities of various sizes (440, 800 or 1800 \u03bcm diameter). It was hypothesized that (i) surface concavities would promote cell proliferation, cellular organization within the concavities, and osteogenic differentiation, as a result of a more pronounced 3D micro-environment and CaP nucleation in concavities, and (ii) MSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation would increase with smaller concavity size due to more rapidly occurring 3D cell-cell interactions. We found that concavities indeed affect cell proliferation, with 440 \u03bcm concavities increasing cell proliferation to a larger extent compared to 800 and 1800 \u03bcm concavities as well as planar surfaces. Additionally, concavity size influenced 3D cellular organization within the concavity volume. Interestingly, concavity size promoted osteogenic differentiation of cells, as evidenced by increased osteocalcin gene expression in 440 \u03bcm concavities, and osteocalcin staining predominantly for 440 and 800 \u03bcm concavities, but not for 1800 \u03bcm concavities and only slightly for planar surface controls.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-05-07", "authors": ["Eva RUrquia Edreira", "AstghikHayrapetyan", "Joop G CWolke", "Huib J ECroes", "AlexeyKlymov", "John AJansen", "Jeroen J J Pvan den Beucken"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025006"}

However, in vitro vascular microcapillaries--as well as plug production and microparticle alignment--require mainly circular microchannels that can be used also in applications based on open microchannels. Nowadays, a simple, low cost, and versatile method to fabricate circular microchannels is still missing. Here, we report on a fast, inexpensive, flexible and reproducible method to fabricate circular microchannels by coupling spin coating with micromilled square microchannels. The proposed method is based on the balance between the displacement of liquid PDMS induced by centrifugal forces and the surface tension that tends to keep the liquid accumulated especially in the corners, which become therefore rounded. To show the versatility of the described experimental study we prepared a variety of rounded microchannels, including branched and PMMA-PDMS hybrid configuration microchannels. Finally, an endothelial cell layer was formed by culturing brain endothelial bEnd.3 cells inside the proposed circular microchannels. Results demonstrated a more successful adhesion, growth, and homogeneous distribution of the cells along the circular microchannel than those observed in the square microchannel used as a control.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-05-07", "authors": ["RaffaeleVecchione", "GabrielePitingolo", "DanielaGuarnieri", "Andrea PFalanga", "Paolo ANetti"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025005"}
{"title": "Cardiothoracic Applications of 3-dimensional Printing.", "abstract": "Medical 3-dimensional (3D) printing is emerging as a clinically relevant imaging tool in directing preoperative and intraoperative planning in many surgical specialties and will therefore likely lead to interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers, radiologists, and surgeons. Data from standard imaging modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and rotational angiography can be used to fabricate life-sized models of human anatomy and pathology, as well as patient-specific implants and surgical guides. Cardiovascular 3D-printed models can improve diagnosis and allow for advanced preoperative planning. The majority of applications reported involve congenital heart diseases and valvular and great vessels pathologies. Printed models are suitable for planning both surgical and minimally invasive procedures. Added value has been reported toward improving outcomes, minimizing perioperative risk, and developing new procedures such as transcatheter mitral valve replacements. Similarly, thoracic surgeons are using 3D printing to assess invasion of vital structures by tumors and to assist in diagnosis and treatment of upper and lower airway diseases. Anatomic models enable surgeons to assimilate information more quickly than image review, choose the optimal surgical approach, and achieve surgery in a shorter time. Patient-specific 3D-printed implants are beginning to appear and may have significant impact on cosmetic and life-saving procedures in the future. In summary, cardiothoracic 3D printing is rapidly evolving and may be a potential game-changer for surgeons.

{"title": "How does c-view image quality compare with conventional 2D FFDM?", "abstract": "The FDA approved the use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in 2011 as an adjunct to 2D full field digital mammography (FFDM) with the constraint that all DBT acquisitions must be paired with a 2D image to assure adequate interpretative information is provided. Recently manufacturers have developed methods to provide a synthesized 2D image generated from the DBT data with the hope of sparing patients the radiation exposure from the FFDM acquisition. While this much needed alternative effectively reduces the total radiation burden, differences in image quality must also be considered. The goal of this study was to compare the intrinsic image quality of synthesized 2D c-view and 2D FFDM images in terms of resolution, contrast, and noise.\nTwo phantoms were utilized in this study: the American College of Radiology mammography accreditation phantom (ACR phantom) and a novel 3D printed anthropomorphic breast phantom. Both phantoms were imaged using a Hologic Selenia Dimensions 3D system. Analysis of the ACR phantom includes both visual inspection and objective automated analysis using in-house software. Analysis of the 3D anthropomorphic phantom includes visual assessment of resolution and Fourier analysis of the noise.\nUsing ACR-defined scoring criteria for the ACR phantom, the FFDM images scored statistically higher than c-view according to both the average observer and automated scores. In addition, between 50% and 70% of c-view images failed to meet the nominal minimum ACR accreditation requirements-primarily due to fiber breaks. Software analysis demonstrated that c-view provided enhanced visualization of medium and large microcalcification objects; however, the benefits diminished for smaller high contrast objects and all low contrast objects. Visual analysis of the anthropomorphic phantom showed a measureable loss of resolution in the c-view image (11 lp/mm FFDM, 5 lp/mm c-view) and loss in detection of small microcalcification objects. Spectral analysis of the anthropomorphic phantom showed higher total noise magnitude in the FFDM image compared with c-view. Whereas the FFDM image contained approximately white noise texture, the c-view image exhibited marked noise reduction at midfrequency and high frequency with far less noise suppression at low frequencies resulting in a mottled noise appearance.\nTheir analysis demonstrates many instances where the c-view image quality differs from FFDM. Compared to FFDM, c-view offers a better depiction of objects of certain size and contrast, but provides poorer overall resolution and noise properties. Based on these findings, the utilization of c-view images in the clinical setting requires careful consideration, especially if considering the discontinuation of FFDM imaging. Not explicitly explored in this study is how the combination of DBT + c-view performs relative to DBT + FFDM or FFDM alone.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2016-05-06", "authors": ["Jeffrey SNelson", "Jered RWells", "Jay ABaker", "EhsanSamei"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4947293"}
{"title": "A novel anatomical ceramic root canal simulator for endodontic training.", "abstract": "Endodontic therapy is often complicated and technically demanding. The aim of this study was to develop a reproducible biomimetic root canal model for pre-clinical and postgraduate endodontic training.\nA specific ceramic shaping technique (3D printing and slip casting of a root canal mould) was developed to reproduce canal systems with the desired shape and complexity using a microporous hydroxyapatite (HAp)-based matrix. The microstructural morphology, pore size and porosity, as well as the Vickers microhardness of the ceramic simulators (CS) were assessed and were compared with natural dentin and commercial resin blocks. The reproducibility of the root canal shapes was assessed using the Dice-S\u00f8rensen similarity index. Endodontic treatments, from refitting the access cavity to obturation, were performed on the CS. Each step was controlled by radiography.\nMany properties of the CS were similar to those of natural dental roots, including the mineral component (HAp), porosity (20%, porous CS), pore size (3.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0\u03bcm) and hardness (120.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.4 HV).\nWe showed that it is possible to reproduce the radio-opacity of a tooth and variations in root canal morphology. The endodontic treatments confirmed that the CS provided good tactile sensation during instrumentation and displayed suitable radiological behaviour.\nThis novel anatomic root canal simulator is well suited for training undergraduate and postgraduate students in endodontic procedures.", "journal": "European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe", "date": "2016-05-06", "authors": ["LRobberecht", "FChai", "MDehurtevent", "PMarchandise", "TB\u00e9cavin", "J-CHornez", "EDeveaux"], "doi": "10.1111/eje.12207"}

{"title": "3D scanning and printing skeletal tissues for anatomy education.", "abstract": "Detailed anatomical models can be produced with consumer-level 3D scanning and printing systems. 3D replication techniques are significant advances for anatomical education as they allow practitioners to more easily introduce diverse or numerous specimens into classrooms. Here we present a methodology for producing anatomical models in-house, with the chondrocranium cartilage from a spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and the skeleton of a cane toad (Rhinella marina) as case studies. 3D digital replicas were produced using two consumer-level scanners and specimens were 3D-printed with selective laser sintering. The fidelity of the two case study models was determined with respect to key anatomical features. Larger-scale features of the dogfish chondrocranium and frog skeleton were all well-resolved and distinct in the 3D digital models, and many finer-scale features were also well-resolved, but some more subtle features were absent from the digital models (e.g. endolymphatic foramina in chondrocranium). All characters identified in the digital chondrocranium could be identified in the subsequent 3D print; however, three characters in the 3D-printed frog skeleton could not be clearly delimited (palatines, parasphenoid and pubis). Characters that were absent in the digital models or 3D prints had low-relief in the original scanned specimen and represent a minor loss of fidelity. Our method description and case studies show that minimal equipment and training is needed to produce durable skeletal specimens. These technologies support the tailored production of models for specific classes or research aims.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2016-05-06", "authors": ["Daniel BThomas", "Jessica DHiscox", "Blair JDixon", "JohanPotgieter"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.12484\n10.2305/IUCN.UK.2006.RLTS.T39326A10201416.en"}
{"title": "Clinical Application and Multidisciplinary Assessment of Three Dimensional Printing in Double Outlet Right Ventricle With Remote Ventricular Septal Defect.", "abstract": "Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with two well-developed ventricles and with a remote ventricular septal defect (VSD) may present a therapeutic challenge. Echocardiographic imaging of such complex cases does not always provide all of the information required to decide on an operative approach (biventricular or univentricular) and to design an intracardiac baffle to direct left ventricular outflow through the VSD and to the aorta for biventricular repair. A three dimensional (3D) printed model of the heart based upon data derived from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may contribute to a more complete appreciation of the intracardiac anatomy.\nFrom April to September 2015, six consecutive patients with DORV and remote VSD underwent CT/MRI scans. Data sets from these studies were used to generate life-size 3D models using a 3D printer. We compared the assessment of 3D printed heart model findings with information obtained from echocardiography, CT, or cardiac MRI and with details of the surgeon's intraoperative direct observations when available. Quantification of the information provided by the 3D model was achieved using a unique scale that was created for the purpose of this study. The accuracy and utility of information derived preoperatively from the models were assessed.\nSix data sets from six patients were analyzed. Five data sets could be successfully used to create sandstone models using 3D printing. The five patients ranged from 7 months to 11 years of age and weighed 6.7 to 26 kg. The spatial orientation of the heart in the thorax, the relationships of the great arteries and the semilunar valves, the size and location of the VSD were well appreciated in all models, as were the anticipated dimensions and orientation of a surgically planned interventricular baffle. Three of the five patients underwent successful biventricular repair.\nThe 3D printed models scored higher than conventional imaging, with respect to most aspects of the surface spatial orientation and intracardiac anatomy. The models are a useful adjunct in preoperative assessment of complex DORV.

{"title": "Terahertz imaging and tomography as efficient instruments for testing polymer additive manufacturing objects.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) technology is not only used to make 3D objects but also for rapid prototyping. In industry and laboratories, quality controls for these objects are necessary though difficult to implement compared to classical methods of fabrication because the layer-by-layer printing allows for very complex object manufacturing that is unachievable with standard tools. Furthermore, AM can induce unknown or unexpected defects. Consequently, we demonstrate terahertz (THz) imaging as an innovative method for 2D inspection of polymer materials. Moreover, THz tomography may be considered as an alternative to x-ray tomography and cheaper 3D imaging for routine control. This paper proposes an experimental study of 3D polymer objects obtained by additive manufacturing techniques. This approach allows us to characterize defects and to control dimensions by volumetric measurements on 3D data reconstructed by tomography.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2016-05-04", "authors": ["J BPerraud", "A FObaton", "JBou-Sleiman", "BRecur", "HBalacey", "FDarracq", "J PGuillet", "PMounaix"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.55.003462"}
{"title": "A Novel Method of Orbital Floor Reconstruction Using Virtual Planning, 3-Dimensional Printing, and Autologous Bone.", "abstract": "Fractures of the orbital floor are often a result of traffic accidents or interpersonal violence. To date, numerous materials and methods have been used to reconstruct the orbital floor. However, simple and cost-effective 3-dimensional (3D) printing technologies for the treatment of orbital floor fractures are still sought. This study describes a simple, precise, cost-effective method of treating orbital fractures using 3D printing technologies in combination with autologous bone. Enophthalmos and diplopia developed in a 64-year-old female patient with an orbital floor fracture. A virtual 3D model of the fracture site was generated from computed tomography images of the patient. The fracture was virtually closed using spline interpolation. Furthermore, a virtual individualized mold of the defect site was created, which was manufactured using an inkjet printer. The tangible mold was subsequently used during surgery to sculpture an individualized autologous orbital floor implant. Virtual reconstruction of the orbital floor and the resulting mold enhanced the overall accuracy and efficiency of the surgical procedure. The sculptured autologous orbital floor implant showed an excellent fit in\u00a0vivo.

{"title": "Biodegradable Polymers and Stem Cells for Bioprinting.", "abstract": "It is imperative to develop organ manufacturing technologies based on the high organ failure mortality and serious donor shortage problems. As an emerging and promising technology, bioprinting has attracted more and more attention with its super precision, easy reproduction, fast manipulation and advantages in many hot research areas, such as tissue engineering, organ manufacturing, and drug screening. Basically, bioprinting technology consists of inkjet bioprinting, laser-based bioprinting and extrusion-based bioprinting techniques. Biodegradable polymers and stem cells are common printing inks. In the printed constructs, biodegradable polymers are usually used as support scaffolds, while stem cells can be engaged to differentiate into different cell/tissue types.

The inwardly directed skull pins provide an easily calibrated force against the skull.\nThis device allowed for head fixation within 1 week after implantation surgery. The low-profile design maximized the area of the skull available and potential implant orientations for electrophysiological experiments.

{"title": "Microfluidic-based generation of functional microfibers for biomimetic complex tissue construction.", "abstract": "Microfluidic-based fiber system displays great potential in reconstructing naturally complex tissues. In these systems, fabrication of the basic fiber is a significant factor in ensuring a functional construction. The fiber should possess the strong mechanical rigidity for assembly, predefined microenvironment for cell spatial distribution and high biocompatibility for cell functional expression. Herein we presented a composite material by the combination of methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and alginate for fiber engineering with capillary microfluidic device. Being regulated by GelMA incorporation, the composite hydrogels exhibited higher mechanical moduli, better stretching performance, and lower swelling compared to pure alginate one. On the basis of the composite material and capillary microfluidic device, we constructed the double-layer hollow microfibers to simulate complex tissues. The microfibers could be precisely controlled in size and multi-layered structure by varying flow rates and outlet diameter, and it showed satisfied application in woven-structure assembly. As an example to mimic a functional tissue, a biomimetic osteon-like structure was fabricated by encapsulating human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in middle layer to imitate vascular vessel and human osteoblast-like cells (MG63) in the outer layer to act role of bone. During the incubation period, both MG63 and HUVECs exhibited not only a robust growth, but also up-regulated gene expression. These results demonstrated this microfluidic-based composite microfibers system is a promising alternative in complex tissue regeneration.\nCell-laden microfibers based on microfluidic device is attracting interest for reconstructing naturally complex tissues. One shortage is the lack of suitable materials which satisfy microfluidic fabrication and cell biofunctional survival. This study reports the first combination of alginate-GelMA composite and capillary-based microfluidic technology. The composite materials possess high mechanical properties for fabrication and assembly, and tunable environment for cell spatial encapsulation. Significantly, the engineered double-layer hollow microfiber with osteon-like structure showed enhanced cellular bioactivity and realized initially functional establishment.

{"title": "Adding functionality with additive manufacturing: Fabrication of titanium-based antibiotic eluting implants.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing technologies have been utilised in healthcare to create patient-specific implants. This study demonstrates the potential to add new implant functionality by further exploiting the design flexibility of these technologies. Selective laser melting was used to manufacture titanium-based (Ti-6Al-4V) implants containing a reservoir. Pore channels, connecting the implant surface to the reservoir, were incorporated to facilitate antibiotic delivery. An injectable brushite, calcium phosphate cement, was formulated as a carrier vehicle for gentamicin. Incorporation of the antibiotic significantly (p=0.01) improved the compressive strength (5.8\u00b10.7MPa) of the cement compared to non-antibiotic samples. The controlled release of gentamicin sulphate from the calcium phosphate cement injected into the implant reservoir was demonstrated in short term elution studies using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Orientation of the implant pore channels were shown, using micro-computed tomography, to impact design reproducibility and the back-pressure generated during cement injection which ultimately altered porosity. The amount of antibiotic released from all implant designs over a 6hour period (<28% of the total amount) were found to exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus (16\u03bcg/mL) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1\u03bcg/mL); two bacterial species commonly associated with periprosthetic infections. Antibacterial efficacy was confirmed against both bacterial cultures using an agar diffusion assay. Interestingly, pore channel orientation was shown to influence the directionality of inhibition zones.

Two different outermost atomic layers were manufactured separately by using an ALD (atomic layer deposition) method. Interestingly, we found that each outermost atomic layer exhibited certain differences against gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial species. Zinc atoms as outermost layer (ZnO-Zn) showed a more pronounced antibacterial effect towards gram-negative E. coli (Escherichia coli), whereas oxygen atoms (ZnO-O) showed a stronger antibacterial activity against gram-positive S. aureus (Staphylococcus aureus).

As a test case, we built and validated an interlock meter-mix device for accurately metering and lysing human urine samples for use in downstream nucleic acid amplification. Two plungers and a multivalve generated and controlled fluid flow through the device and demonstrate the utility of 3D printing to create leak-free seals. Device operation consists of three simple steps that must be performed sequentially, eliminating manual pipetting and vortexing to provide rapid (5 to 10 s) and accurate metering and mixing. Bretherton's prediction was applied, using the bond number to guide a design that prevents potentially biohazardous samples from leaking from the device. We employed multi-material 3D printing technology, which allows composites with rigid and elastomeric properties to be printed as a single part. To validate the meter-mix device with a clinically relevant sample, we used urine spiked with inactivated Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A downstream nucleic acid amplification by quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed there was no statistically significant difference between samples metered and mixed using the standard protocol and those prepared with the meter-mix device, showing the 3D-printed device could accurately meter, mix and dispense a human urine sample without loss of nucleic acids. Although there are some limitations to 3D printing capabilities (e.g. dimension limitations related to support material used in the printing process), the advantages of customizability, modularity and rapid prototyping illustrate the utility of 3D printing for developing sample-to-device interfaces for diagnostics.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-04-29", "authors": ["ErikJue", "Nathan GSchoepp", "DaanWitters", "Rustem FIsmagilov"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc00292g"}

However, in many applications the success of these 3D printed materials as a viable replacement for traditional stochastic foams critically depends on their mechanical performance and micro-architectural stability while deployed under long-term mechanical strain. To predict the long-term performance of the two types of foams we employed multi-year-long accelerated aging studies under compressive strain followed by a time-temperature-superposition analysis using a minimum-arc-length-based algorithm. The resulting master curves predict superior long-term performance of the 3D printed foam in terms of two different metrics, i.e., compression set and load retention. To gain deeper understanding, we imaged the microstructure of both foams using X-ray computed tomography, and performed finite-element analysis of the mechanical response within these microstructures. This indicates a wider stress variation in the stochastic foam with points of more extreme local stress as compared to the 3D printed material, which might explain the latter's improved long-term stability and mechanical performance.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-04-28", "authors": ["AMaiti", "WSmall", "J PLewicki", "T HWeisgraber", "E BDuoss", "S CChinn", "M APearson", "C MSpadaccini", "R SMaxwell", "T SWilson"], "doi": "10.1038/srep24871"}

{"title": "Tuning Cell Differentiation into a 3D Scaffold Presenting a Pore Shape Gradient for Osteochondral Regeneration.", "abstract": "Osteochondral regeneration remains nowadays a major problem since the outcome of current techniques is not satisfactory in terms of functional tissue formation and development. A possible solution is the combination of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with additive manufacturing technologies to fabricate scaffolds with instructive properties. In this study, the differentiation of hMSCs within a scaffold presenting a gradient in pore shape is presented. The variation in pore shape is determined by varying the angle formed by the fibers of two consequent layers. The fiber deposition patterns are 0-90, which generate squared pores, 0-45, 0-30, and 0-15, that generate rhomboidal pores with an increasing major axis as the deposition angle decreases. Within the gradient construct, squared pores support a better chondrogenic differentiation whereas cells residing in the rhomboidal pores display a better osteogenic differentiation. When cultured under osteochondral conditions the trend in both osteogenic and chondrogenic markers is maintained. Engineering the pore shape, thus creating axial gradients in structural properties, seems to be an instructive strategy to fabricate functional 3D scaffolds that are able to influence hMSCs differentiation for osteochondral tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2016-04-26", "authors": ["AndreaDi Luca", "IvanLorenzo-Moldero", "CarlosMota", "AntonioLepedda", "DietmarAuhl", "ClemensVan Blitterswijk", "LorenzoMoroni"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201600083"}
{"title": "3D Printed Reversible Shape Changing Components with Stimuli Responsive Materials.", "abstract": "The creation of reversibly-actuating components that alter their shapes in a controllable manner in response to environmental stimuli is a grand challenge in active materials, structures, and robotics. Here we demonstrate a new reversible shape-changing component design concept enabled by 3D printing two stimuli responsive polymers-shape memory polymers and hydrogels-in prescribed 3D architectures. This approach uses the swelling of a hydrogel as the driving force for the shape change, and the temperature-dependent modulus of a shape memory polymer to regulate the time of such shape change. Controlling the temperature and aqueous environment allows switching between two stable configurations - the structures are relatively stiff and can carry load in each - without any mechanical loading and unloading. Specific shape changing scenarios, e.g., based on bending, or twisting in prescribed directions, are enabled via the controlled interplay between the active materials and the 3D printed architectures. The physical phenomena are complex and nonintuitive, and so to help understand the interplay of geometric, material, and environmental stimuli parameters we develop 3D nonlinear finite element models. Finally, we create several 2D and 3D shape changing components that demonstrate the role of key parameters and illustrate the broad application potential of the proposed approach.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-04-26", "authors": ["YiqiMao", "ZhenDing", "ChaoYuan", "ShigangAi", "MichaelIsakov", "JiangtaoWu", "TiejunWang", "Martin LDunn", "H JerryQi"], "doi": "10.1038/srep24761\n10.1243/09544100jaero211\n10.1002/1521-3773(20020617)41:12\u2009<\u20092034::Aid-Anie2034\u2009>\u20093.0.Co;2-M\n10.1039/B615954k\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2015.04.001\n10.1021/Ma071517z\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/6/065010\n10.1039/c5ra01039j\n10.1177/1045389X07077856\n10.1002/polb.23312\n10.1117/12.2046154\n10.1002/adma.201301986\n10.1126/science.1252291\n10.1364/oe.21.024422\n10.1007/s10856-006-0073-2\n10.1016/S0928-4931(02)00012-7\n10.1007/s10856-005-4716-5\n10.1063/1.4819837\n10.1108/Aa-07-2014-062\n10.1038/srep07422\n10.1038/Srep13616\n10.1038/Srep08936\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2011.09.004\n10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70047-0\n10.1063/1.4819837\n10.1016/j.jmps.2015.09.003\n10.1115/1.4030876"}
{"title": "Controllable 3D alginate hydrogel patterning via visible-light induced electrodeposition.", "abstract": "The fabrication of alginate hydrogel in 3D has recently received increasing attention owing to its distinct efficacy as biocompatible scaffold for 3D cell culture, biomedical and tissue engineering. We report a controllable 3D alginate hydrogel patterning method by developing a visible-light induced electrodeposition chip. The chip mainly consists of a photoconductive titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) anode plate, an indium tin oxide (ITO) cathode plate and the mixed solution (1% sodium alginate and 0.25% CaCO3 nano particles) between them. After a designed visible-light pattern is projected onto the TiOPc plate, the produced H(+) by electrolysis will trigger Ca(2+) near the anode (illuminated area), and then the gelation of calcium alginate patterns, as desired, happens controllably. In addition, we further establish an exponential model to elucidate the gel growth v.s. time and current density. The results indicate that the proposed method is able to fabricate various 3D alginate hydrogel patterns in a well controllable manner, and maintain the laden cells at high survival rate (>98% right after gel formation).

{"title": "Micro-precise spatiotemporal delivery system embedded in 3D printing for complex tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) printing has emerged as an efficient tool for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, given its advantages for constructing custom-designed scaffolds with tunable microstructure/physical properties. Here we developed a micro-precise spatiotemporal delivery system embedded in 3D printed scaffolds. PLGA microspheres (\u03bcS) were encapsulated with growth factors (GFs) and then embedded inside PCL microfibers that constitute custom-designed 3D scaffolds. Given the substantial difference in the melting points between PLGA and PCL and their low heat conductivity, \u03bcS were able to maintain its original structure while protecting GF's bioactivities. Micro-precise spatial control of multiple GFs was achieved by interchanging dispensing cartridges during a single printing process. Spatially controlled delivery of GFs, with a prolonged release, guided formation of multi-tissue interfaces from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs). To investigate efficacy of the micro-precise delivery system embedded in 3D printed scaffold, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc scaffolds were fabricated with micro-precise spatiotemporal delivery of CTGF and TGF\u03b23, mimicking native-like multiphase fibrocartilage. In vitro, TMJ disc scaffolds spatially embedded with CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u03bcS resulted in formation of multiphase fibrocartilaginous tissues from MSCs. In vivo, TMJ disc perforation was performed in rabbits, followed by implantation of CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u03bcS-embedded scaffolds. After 4 wks, CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u03bcS embedded scaffolds significantly improved healing of the perforated TMJ disc as compared to the degenerated TMJ disc in the control group with scaffold embedded with empty \u03bcS. In addition, CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u03bcS embedded scaffolds significantly prevented arthritic changes on TMJ condyles.

Vertical microelectromechanical switches reduce the form factor and increase the area density of such devices in integrated circuits. We studied the electromechanical characteristics of such vertical switches by exploring the dependence of switching voltage on various device structures, particularly with regard to the length, wire diameter, and the distance between the two wires. A simple model was found to match the experimental measurements made in this study. We found that the electrodeposited copper microwires exhibit a good elastic modulus close to that of bulk copper. By optimizing the 3D structure of the electrodes, a volatile electromechanical switch with a sub-5\u2009V switching voltage was demonstrated in a vertical microscale switch with a gap distance as small as 100\u2009nm created with a pair of copper wires with diameters of ~1\u2009\u03bcm and heights of 25\u2009\u03bcm.

{"title": "Hinokitiol-Loaded Mesoporous Calcium Silicate Nanoparticles Induce Apoptotic Cell Death through Regulation of the Function of MDR1 in Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells.", "abstract": "Hinokitiol is a tropolone-related compound found in heartwood cupressaceous plants. Hinokitiol slows the growth of a variety of cancers through inhibition of cell proliferation. The low water solubility of hinokitiol leads to less bioavailability. This has been highlighted as a major limiting factor. In this study, mesoporous calcium silicate (MCS) nanoparticles, both pure and hinokitiol-loaded, were synthesized and their effects on A549 cells were analyzed. The results indicate that Hino-MCS nanoparticles induce apoptosis in higher concentration loads (>12.5 \u03bcg/mL) for A549 cells. Hino-MCS nanoparticles suppress gene and protein expression levels of multiple drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). In addition, both the activity and the expression levels of caspase-3/-9 were measured in Hino-MCS nanoparticle-treated A549 cells. The Hino-MCS nanoparticles-triggered apoptosis was blocked by inhibitors of pan-caspase, caspase-3/-9, and antioxidant agents (N-acetylcysteine; NAC). The Hino-MCS nanoparticles enhance reactive oxygen species production and the protein expression levels of caspase-3/-9. Our data suggest that Hino-MCS nanoparticles trigger an intrinsic apoptotic pathway through regulating the function of MDR1 and the production of reactive oxygen species in A549 cells.

However, their use in other applications, for example as a source of focused ultrasound for targeted drug delivery, is hindered in several ways. One of the issues, which we consider here, is in shaping the material into the spherical geometries used widely in focused ultrasound. Unlike isotropic unpoled piezoceramics that can be shaped into a monolithic bowl then poled through the thickness, the anisotropic structure of piezocrystals make it impossible to machine the bulk crystalline material into a bowl without sacrificing performance. Instead, we report a novel faceted array, inspired by the geodesic dome structure in architecture, which utilizes flat piezocrystal material and maximizes fill factor. Aided by 3D printing, a prototype with f#\u2248\u00a01.2, containing 96 individually addressable elements was manufactured using 1-3 connectivity PMN-PT piezocrystal-epoxy composite.

At an operating frequency of 1MHz, a focusing gain around 30 was achieved and the side lobe intensities were all at levels below -12dB compared to main beam.

{"title": "The upcoming 3D-printing revolution in microfluidics.", "abstract": "In the last two decades, the vast majority of microfluidic systems have been built in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) by soft lithography, a technique based on PDMS micromolding. A long list of key PDMS properties have contributed to the success of soft lithography: PDMS is biocompatible, elastomeric, transparent, gas-permeable, water-impermeable, fairly inexpensive, copyright-free, and rapidly prototyped with high precision using simple procedures. However, the fabrication process typically involves substantial human labor, which tends to make PDMS devices difficult to disseminate outside of research labs, and the layered molding limits the 3D complexity of the devices that can be produced. 3D-printing has recently attracted attention as a way to fabricate microfluidic systems due to its automated, assembly-free 3D fabrication, rapidly decreasing costs, and fast-improving resolution and throughput. Resins with properties approaching those of PDMS are being developed. Here we review past and recent efforts in 3D-printing of microfluidic systems. We compare the salient features of PDMS molding with those of 3D-printing and we give an overview of the critical barriers that have prevented the adoption of 3D-printing by microfluidic developers, namely resolution, throughput, and resin biocompatibility. We also evaluate the various forces that are persuading researchers to abandon PDMS molding in favor of 3D-printing in growing numbers.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-04-22", "authors": ["NirveekBhattacharjee", "ArturoUrrios", "ShawnKang", "AlbertFolch"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc00163g"}

A tissue-engineered approach would not require a donor source, while providing an implant that meets both surgeons' and patients' needs. A fibrous, polymeric scaffold organized in gradient bilayers of polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) with 3D printed structural ring supports, inspired by the native trachea rings, could meet this need. The purpose of the current study was to characterize the tracheal scaffolds with mechanical testing models to determine the design most suitable for maintaining a patent airway. Degradation over 12 weeks revealed that scaffolds with the 3D printed rings had superior properties in tensile and radial compression, with at least a three fold improvement and 8.5-fold improvement, respectively, relative to the other scaffold groups. The ringed scaffolds produced tensile moduli, radial compressive forces, and burst pressures similar to or exceeding physiological forces and native tissue data. Scaffolds with a thicker PCL component had better suture retention and tube flattening recovery properties, with the monolayer of PCL (PCL-only group) exhibiting a 2.3-fold increase in suture retention strength (SRS). Tracheal scaffolds with ring reinforcements have improved mechanical properties, while the fibrous component increased porosity and cell infiltration potential.

Suspension particles are accumulated in a localised area, one order of magnitude smaller than the original droplet size. By scanning the laser beam over the droplet, particles can be deposited in an arbitrary pattern. This finding raises the possibility for direct laser writing of suspended particles through a liquid layer.

Complex shaped particles can provide unique benefits for areas such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, structural materials, and self-assembly building blocks. Current methods of creating complex shaped particles such as 3D printing, photolithography, and imprint lithography are limited by either slow speeds, shape limitations, or expensive processes. Previously, we presented a novel microfluidic flow lithography fabrication scheme combined with fluid inertia called optofluidic fabrication for the creation of complex shaped three-dimensional (3D) particles. This process was able to address the aforementioned limits and overcome two-dimensional shape limitations faced by traditional flow lithography methods; however, all of the created 3D particle shapes displayed top-down symmetry. Here, by introducing the time dimension into our existing optofluidic fabrication process, we break this top-down symmetry, generating fully asymmetric 3D particles where we termed the process: four-dimensional (4D) optofluidic fabrication. This 4D optofluidic fabrication is comprised of three sequential procedures. First, density mismatched precursor fluids flow past pillars within fluidic channels to manipulate the flow cross sections via fluid inertia. Next, the time dimension is incorporated by stopping the flow and allowing the denser fluids to settle by gravity to create asymmetric flow cross sections. Finally, the fluids are exposed to patterned ultraviolet (UV) light in order to polymerize fully asymmetric 3D-shaped particles. By varying inertial flow shaping, gravity-induced flow shaping, and UV light patterns, 4D optofluidic fabrication can create an infinite set of complex shaped asymmetric particles.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-04-20", "authors": ["Kevin SPaulsen", "Aram JChung"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc00208k"}

However, the printed cells in this hydrogel could not degrade the surrounding alginate gel matrix, causing them to remain in a poorly proliferating and non-differentiating state. Here, we report a novel study of the 3D printing of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs)/collagen/gelatin/alginate hydrogel incubated with a medium containing sodium citrate to obtain degradation-controllable cell-laden tissue constructs. The 3D-printed hydrogel network with interconnected channels and a macroporous structure was stable and achieved high cell viability (over 90%). By altering the mole ratio of sodium citrate/sodium alginate, the degradation time of the bioprinting constructs can be controlled. Cell proliferation and specific marker protein expression results also revealed that with the help of sodium citrate degradation, the printed HCECs showed a higher proliferation rate and greater cytokeratin 3(CK3) expression, indicating that this newly developed method may help to improve the alginate bioink system for the application of 3D bioprinting in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-04-20", "authors": ["ZhengjieWu", "XinSu", "YuanyuanXu", "BinKong", "WeiSun", "ShengliMi"], "doi": "10.1038/srep24474"}

It becomes particularly problematic when creating anatomically complex shapes such as the ear. The aim of this study was to develop a contraction-free biocompatible scaffold construct for ear cartilage tissue engineering. To address this aim, we used three constructs: (i) a fibrin/hyaluronic acid (FB/HA) hydrogel, (ii) a FB/HA hydrogel combined with a collagen I/III scaffold, and (iii) a cage construct containing (ii) surrounded by a 3D-printed poly-\u025b-caprolactone mold. A wide range of different cell types were tested within these constructs, including chondrocytes, perichondrocytes, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and their combinations. After in vitro culturing for 1, 14, and 28 days, all constructs were analyzed. Macroscopic observation showed severe contraction of the cell-seeded hydrogel (i). This could be prevented, in part, by combining the hydrogel with the collagen scaffold (ii) and prevented in total using the 3D-printed cage construct (iii). (Immuno)histological analysis, multiphoton laser scanning microscopy, and biomechanical analysis showed extracellular matrix deposition and increased Young's modulus and thereby the feasibility of ear cartilage engineering.

The paper reviews recent applications of microfluidics and microtechnology to study processes of oil extraction and recovery. It shows that microfluidic devices can be useful tools in investigation and visualization of such processes used in the oil & gas industry as fluid propagation, flooding, fracturing, emulsification and many others. Critical macro-scale processes that define oil extraction and recovery are controlled by the micro-scale processes based on wetting, adhesion, surface tension, colloids and other concepts of microfluidics. A growing number of research efforts demonstrates that microfluidics is becoming, albeit slowly, an accepted methodology in this area. We propose several areas of development where implementation of microfluidics may bring about deeper understanding and hence better control over the processes of oil recovery based on fluid propagation, droplet generation, wettability control. Studies of processes such as hydraulic fracturing, sand particle propagation in porous networks, high throughput screening of chemicals (for example, emulsifiers and surfactants) in microfluidic devices that simulate oil reservoirs are proposed to improve our understanding of these complicated physico-chemical systems.

Laser sintered disks were fabricated to have micro-/nano-roughness and wettability. Control disks were computer numerical control (CNC) milled and then polished to be smooth (CNC-M). Laser sintered disks were polished smooth (LST-M), grit blasted (LST-B), or blasted and acid etched (LST-BE). LST-BE implants or implants manufactured by CNC milling and grit blasted (CNC-B) were implanted in the femurs of male New Zealand white rabbits. Most osteoblast differentiation markers and local factors were enhanced on rough LST-B and LST-BE surfaces in comparison to smooth CNC-M or LST-M surfaces for MG63 and normal human osteoblast cells. To determine if LST-BE implants were osteogenic in vivo, we compared them to implant surfaces used clinically. LST-BE implants had a unique surface with combined micro-/nano-roughness and higher wettability than conventional CNC-B implants. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in cortical bone-implant contact of LST-BE implants compared to CNC-B implants after 3 and 6 weeks. However, mechanical testing revealed no differences between implant pullout forces at those time points. LST surfaces enhanced osteoblast differentiation and production of local factors in vitro and improved the osseointegration process in vivo. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To overcome these limitations, several research groups have been exploring novel methodologies through which a construct, generated via SFF, is applied as a sacrificial mould for production of the final construct. The technique combines the benefits of SFF techniques in terms of controlled, patient-specific design with a large freedom in material selection associated with conventional scaffold production techniques. Consequently, well-defined 3D scaffolds can be generated in a straightforward manner from previously difficult to print and even \"unprintable\" materials due to thermomechanical properties that do not match the often strict temperature and pressure requirements for direct rapid prototyping. These include several biomaterials, thermally degradable materials, ceramics and composites. Since it can be combined with conventional pore forming techniques, indirect rapid prototyping (iRP) enables the creation of a hierarchical porosity in the final scaffold with micropores inside the struts. Consequently, scaffolds and implants for applications in both soft and hard tissue regeneration have been reported. In this review, an overview of different iRP strategies and materials are presented from the first reports of the approach at the turn of the century until now.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-04-16", "authors": ["AnnemieHouben", "JasperVan Hoorick", "J\u00fcrgenVan Erps", "HugoThienpont", "SandraVan Vlierberghe", "PeterDubruel"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-016-1610-x"}

Communication between tumor cells and their stroma has been shown as a fundamental driving force of the tumoral process. A great deal of effort has been focused on depicting their specific interactions and crosstalk. However, most research has been carried out in 2D conventional cultures that alter cell morphology and intracellular signaling processes. Considering these premises, we have developed a 3D cell co-culture model to mimic T cell infiltration into the tumor mass and explore tumor-immune cells interactions in the TME. Expression of specific cell markers and assessment of cell proliferation were carried out to characterize the proposed 3D co-culture model. Additionally, the study and profiling of the secretome revealed a subset of particular cancer-related inflammation proteins prompted upon 3D cultivation of tumor cells in presence of lymphocytes, pointing out an intercellular communication. Altogether, these results suggest that our 3D cell co-culture model can be a useful tool to identify and study critical factors mediating the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells in the TME.

Materials based on proteins are especially appealing, as the structure and functionality of proteins can be adapted by genetic engineering. Furthermore, strategies and tools for protein production have been developed and refined steadily for more than 30 years. However, protein conformation and therefore activity might be sensitive to production conditions. Here, we have explored whether the downstream strategy influences the structure and biological activities, in vitro and in vivo, of a self-assembling, CD44-targeted protein-only nanoparticle produced in Escherichia coli. This has been performed through the comparative analysis of particles built from soluble protein species or protein versions obtained by in vitro protein extraction from inclusion bodies, through mild, non-denaturing procedures. These methods have been developed recently as a convenient alternative to the use of toxic chaotropic agents for protein resolubilization from protein aggregates.

{"title": "Laser-induced Forward Transfer of Ag Nanopaste.", "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been much development of non-lithographic methods(1-3) for printing metallic inks or other functional materials. Many of these processes such as inkjet(3) and laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT)(4) have become increasingly popular as interest in printable electronics and maskless patterning has grown. These additive manufacturing processes are inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and well suited for rapid prototyping, when compared to more traditional semiconductor processing techniques. While most direct-write processes are confined to two-dimensional structures and cannot handle materials with high viscosity (particularly inkjet), LIFT can transcend both constraints if performed properly. Congruent transfer of three dimensional pixels (called voxels), also referred to as laser decal transfer (LDT)(5-9), has recently been demonstrated with the LIFT technique using highly viscous Ag nanopastes to fabricate freestanding interconnects, complex voxel shapes, and high-aspect-ratio structures. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple yet versatile process for fabricating a variety of micro- and macroscale Ag structures.

The protocol then further describes the preparation of composite catalyst-silicone materials for incorporation into the 3D-printed device and the steps required to fabricate a reactionware device. This combined approach allows versatility in the design and use of reactionware based on the specific needs of the experimental user. To illustrate this, we present a detailed procedure for the production of one such reactionware device that will result in the production of a sealed reactor capable of effecting a multistep organic synthesis.

{"title": "Design and Experimental Evaluation of a Non-Invasive Microwave Head Imaging System for Intracranial Haemorrhage Detection.", "abstract": "An intracranial haemorrhage is a life threatening medical emergency, yet only a fraction of the patients receive treatment in time, primarily due to the transport delay in accessing diagnostic equipment in hospitals such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography. A mono-static microwave head imaging system that can be carried in an ambulance for the detection and localization of intracranial haemorrhage is presented. The system employs a single ultra-wideband antenna as sensing element to transmit signals in low microwave frequencies towards the head and capture backscattered signals. The compact and low-profile antenna provides stable directional radiation patterns over the operating bandwidth in both near and far-fields. Numerical analysis of the head imaging system with a realistic head model in various situations is performed to realize the scattering mechanism of haemorrhage. A modified delay-and-summation back-projection algorithm, which includes effects of surface waves and a distance-dependent effective permittivity model, is proposed for signal and image post-processing. The efficacy of the automated head imaging system is evaluated using a 3D-printed human head phantom with frequency dispersive dielectric properties including emulated haemorrhages with different sizes located at different depths. Scattered signals are acquired with a compact transceiver in a mono-static circular scanning profile. The reconstructed images demonstrate that the system is capable of detecting haemorrhages as small as 1 cm3. While quantitative analyses reveal that the quality of images gradually degrades with the increase of the haemorrhage's depth due to the reduction of signal penetration inside the head; rigorous statistical analysis suggests that substantial improvement in image quality can be obtained by increasing the data samples collected around the head. The proposed head imaging prototype along with the processing algorithm demonstrates its feasibility for potential use in ambulances as an effective and low cost diagnostic tool to assure timely triaging of intracranial hemorrhage patients.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["A TMobashsher", "K SBialkowski", "A MAbbosh", "SCrozier"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0152351\n10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70264-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0142338\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048458\n10.1038/nrneurol.2010.146\n10.1038/jcbfm.2014.73\n10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70041-3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0096743\n10.1371/journal.pone.0105970\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002075\n10.1371/journal.pone.0055020\n10.1088/0957-0233/23/8/085501\n10.1371/journal.pone.0128127\n10.1155/2012/851234\n10.1155/2012/697253\n10.1155/2012/562563\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.12.007\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2330554\n10.1155/2008/254830\n10.1109/TMTT.2014.2342669\n10.1038/srep20459\n10.1049/el.2015.2763\n10.1109/LAWP.2016.2519527\n10.1049/el.2014.0616\n10.1109/MAP.2015.2414488\n10.1109/LAWP.2014.2318035\n10.7205/MILMED-D-14-00413\n10.1109/MMM.2015.2419772\n10.1109/LAWP.2014.2340409\n10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.02.001\n10.4103/0974-2700.58662\n10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60151-2"}
{"title": "Modular Tissue Assembly Strategies for Biofabrication of Engineered Cartilage.", "abstract": "This review describes the prospects of applying modular assembly techniques and strategies for fabrication of advanced tissue engineered cartilage constructs. Articular cartilage is a tissue that has important functions in preserving and enabling locomotion. However, its limited intrinsic repair capacity and lack of current long-term clinical solutions makes it a candidate for repair or regeneration via tissue engineering strategies. Key advances in biofabrication and 3D bioprinting techniques allowing the specific placement of cells and tissues enable novel strategies to be adopted with increased chances of success. In particular, modular assembly, where separate biological components such as microtissue units, cellular building blocks or spheroids are combined with structural scaffold components to create a functional whole, offers potential as a new strategy for engineering of articular cartilage. Various modular assembly or bottom-up fabrication strategies have been investigated or applied for engineering of a range of tissues and cell types, however, modular approaches to cartilage engineering have been limited thus far. The integrative nature of many current approaches to engineering of articular cartilage means optimization of separate components (such as the scaffold and cells) is challenging, resulting in strategies which are less amenable to clinical scale-up or modification. In addition, current tissue engineering strategies may not replicate the function and complex structure of native tissue. This review outlines recent developments in fabrication of cellular or tissue modules as well as scaffold design where it impacts modular biofabrication, and discusses existing modular approaches applicable to articular cartilage regeneration and repair. Modular tissue assembly approaches allow complex hybrid constructs to be fabricated with direct control over both structural and cellular organization of pre-formed tissue units.

This study investigates the effect of the incorporation of collagen type I in 3D-bioprinted polysaccharide-based hydrogels to the modulation of cell morphology, osteogenic remodeling potential, and mineralization. By combining thermo-responsive agarose hydrogels with collagen type I, the mechanical stiffness and printing contours of printed constructs can be improved compared to pure collagen hydrogels which are typically used as standard materials for MSC osteogenic differentiation. The results presented here show that MSC not only survive the 3D-bioprinting process but also maintain the mesenchymal phenotype, as proved by live/dead staining and immunocytochemistry (vimentin positive, CD34 negative). Increased solids concentrations of collagen in the hydrogel blend induce changes in cell morphology, namely, by enhancing cell spreading, that ultimately contribute to enhanced and directed MSC osteogenic differentiation. 3D-bioprinted agarose-collagen hydrogels with high-collagen ratio are therefore feasible for MSC osteogenic differentiation, contrarily to low-collagen blends, as proved by two-photon microscopy, Alizarin Red staining, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["Daniela FilipaDuarte Campos", "AndreasBlaeser", "KateBuellesbach", "Kshama ShreeSen", "WeiweiXun", "WalterTillmann", "HorstFischer"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201501033"}

In this study, we demonstrate that femtosecond laser ablation of graphene oxide (GO) dispersions could be employed as a facile and environmentally friendly synthesis method for GQDs.

In this paper, we demonstrate the design and manufacture of active composites that can take multiple shapes, depending on the environmental temperature. This is achieved by 3D printing layered composite structures with multiple families of shape memory polymer (SMP) fibers - digital SMPs - with different glass transition temperatures (Tg) to control the transformation of the structure. After a simple single-step thermomechanical programming process, the fiber families can be sequentially activated to bend when the temperature is increased. By tuning the volume fraction of the fibers, bending deformation can be controlled. We develop a theoretical model to predict the deformation behavior for better understanding the phenomena and aiding the design.

Amongst cardiovascular devices, non-compliant balloons are used in several minimally invasive procedures, such as balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Although these balloons are often included in the computer simulations of these procedures, validation of the balloon behaviour is often lacking. We therefore aim to create and validate a computational model of a valvuloplasty balloon.\nA finite element (FE) model of a valvuloplasty balloon (Edwards 9350BC23) was designed, including balloon geometry and material properties from tensile testing.

{"title": "Printing of Three-Dimensional Tissue Analogs for Regenerative Medicine.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3-D) cell printing, which can accurately deposit cells, biomaterial scaffolds and growth factors in precisely defined spatial patterns to form biomimetic tissue structures, has emerged as a powerful enabling technology to create live tissue and organ structures for drug discovery and tissue engineering applications. Unlike traditional 3-D printing that uses metals, plastics and polymers as the printing materials, cell printing has to be compatible with living cells and biological matrix. It is also required that the printing process preserves the biological functions of the cells and extracellular matrix, and to mimic the cell-matrix architectures and mechanical properties of the native tissues. Therefore, there are significant challenges in order to translate the technologies of traditional 3-D printing to cell printing, and ultimately achieve functional outcomes in the printed tissues. So it is essential to develop new technologies specially designed for cell printing and in-depth basic research in the bioprinted tissues, such as developing novel biomaterials specifically for cell printing applications, understanding the complex cell-matrix remodeling for the desired mechanical properties and functional outcomes, establishing proper vascular perfusion in bioprinted tissues, etc. In recent years, many exciting research progresses have been made in the 3-D cell printing technology and its application in engineering live tissue constructs.

Current clinical strategies for complex tracheal reconstruction are of limited availability and efficacy, but tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches may provide viable alternatives. In this study, we have developed a new \"hybrid graft\" approach that utilizes decellularized tracheal tissue along with a resorbable polymer scaffold, and holds promise for potential clinical applications. First, we evaluated the effect of our decellularization process on the compression properties of porcine tracheal segments, and noted approximately 63% decrease in resistance to compression following decellularization. Next we developed four C-shape scaffold designs by varying the base geometry and thickness, and fabricated polycaprolactone scaffolds using a combination of 3D-Bioplotting and thermally-assisted forming. All scaffolds designs were evaluated in vitro under three different environmental testing conditions to determine the design that offered the best resistance to compression. These were further studied to determine the effect of gamma radiation sterilization and cyclic compression loading. Finally, hybrid grafts were developed by securing these optimal design scaffolds to decellularized tracheal segments and evaluated in vitro under physiological testing conditions. Results show that the resistance to compression offered by the hybrid grafts created using gamma radiation sterilized scaffolds was comparable to that of fresh tracheal segments. Given that current clinical attempts at tracheal transplantation using decellularized tissue have been fraught with luminal collapse and complications, our data support the possibility that future embodiments using a hybrid graft approach may reduce the need for intraluminal stenting in tracheal transplant recipients.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2016-04-12", "authors": ["ChristopherJohnson", "PriyankaSheshadri", "Jessica MKetchum", "Lokesh KNarayanan", "Paul MWeinberger", "Rohan AShirwaiker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.03.024"}

Tissue engineering TMJ discs has emerged as an alternative approach to overcoming limitations of current treatments for TMJ disorders. However, the anisotropic collagen orientation and inhomogeneous fibrocartilaginous matrix distribution present challenges in the tissue engineering of functional TMJ discs. Here, we developed 3-dimensional (3D)-printed anatomically correct scaffolds with region-variant microstrand alignment, mimicking anisotropic collagen alignment in the TMJ disc and corresponding mechanical properties. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF\u03b23) were then delivered in the scaffolds by spatially embedding CTGF- or TGF\u03b23-encapsulated microspheres (\u00b5S) to reconstruct the regionally variant fibrocartilaginous matrix in the native TMJ disc. When cultured with human mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) for 6 wk, 3D-printed scaffolds with CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u00b5S resulted in a heterogeneous fibrocartilaginous matrix with overall distribution of collagen-rich fibrous structure in the anterior/posterior (AP) bands and fibrocartilaginous matrix in the intermediate zone, reminiscent of the native TMJ disc. High dose of CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u00b5S (100 mg \u00b5S/g of scaffold) showed significantly more collagen II and aggrecan in the intermediate zone than a low dose (50 mg \u00b5S/g of scaffold). Similarly, a high dose of CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u00b5S yielded significantly higher collagen I expression in the AP bands compared with the low-dose and empty \u00b5S. From stress relaxation tests, the ratio of relaxation modulus to instantaneous modulus was significantly smaller with CTGF/TGF\u03b23-\u00b5S than empty \u00b5S.

A new approach enabling rapid 3D printing of hydrogels in aqueous solutions is presented on the basis of UV-curable inks containing nanoparticles of highly efficient but water-insoluble photoinitiators. The extinction coefficient of the new water-dispersible nanoparticles of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosphine oxide (TPO) is more than 300 times larger than the best and most used commercially available water-soluble photoinitiator. The TPO nanoparticles absorb significantly in the range from 385 to 420 nm, making them suitable for use in commercially available, low-cost, light-emitting diode-based 3D printers using digital light processing.

The TPO nanoparticles were prepared by rapid conversion of volatile microemulsions into water-dispersible powder, a process that can be used for a variety of photoinitiators.

Here we present simple 3D printed microfluidic devices using an inexpensive and readily accessible printer with commercially available printer materials. We demonstrate that previously reported limitations of transparency and fidelity have been overcome, whilst devices capable of operating at pressures in excess of 2000 kPa illustrate that leakage issues have also been resolved. The utility of the 3D printed microfluidic devices is illustrated by encapsulating dental pulp stem cells within alginate droplets; cell viability assays show the vast majority of cells remain live, and device transparency is sufficient for single cell imaging.

{"title": "Update on Biomaterials.", "abstract": "Biomaterials are essential to the use and development of successful treatments for orthopaedic patients. Orthopaedic surgeons need to understand the expected clinical performance and the effects of implants in patients. Recent attempts to improve implant durability have resulted in adverse effects related to biomaterials and their relationship to patients. Examples of these adverse effects in hip arthroplasty include wear and corrosion of metal-on-metal bearings, trunnions, and tapered modular neck junctions. Conversely, polymers and ceramics have shown substantial improvements in durability. Improved implant compositions and manufacturing processes have resulted in ceramic head and acetabular liners with improved material properties and the avoidance of voids, which have, in the past, caused catastrophic fractures. Cross-linking of polyethylene with radiation and doping with antioxidants has substantially increased implant durability and is increasingly being used in joint prostheses other than the hip. Additive manufacturing is potentially a transformative process; it can lead to custom and patient-specific implants and to improvements in material properties, which can be optimized to achieve desired bone responses. Orthopaedic surgeons must understand the material properties and the biologic effects of new or altered biomaterials and manufacturing processes before use. In addition, a clear benefit to the patient must be proven based on superior preclinical results and high-quality clinical investigations before orthopaedic surgeons use new or altered biomaterials.", "journal": "Instructional course lectures", "date": "2016-04-07", "authors": ["Paul AAnderson", "Nicholas JGiori", "Carlos JLavernia", "Jesus MVilla", "A SethGreenwald"], "doi": null}

After PC-MRI acquisition, the data were segmented and coregistered to CFD simulations of identical, but true-scale geometries. Velocities at the inlet region were extracted from the PC-MRI to define the CFD inlet boundary condition.\nThe PC-MRI and CFD flow data agreed well, and comparison showed: 1) small velocity magnitude discrepancies (2-8%); 2) with a Spearman's rank correlation \u22650.72; and 3) a velocity vector correlation (including direction) of r(2) \u2265 0.82. The highest agreement was achieved for high velocity regions with discrepancies being located in slow or recirculating zones with low MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNRv ) in tortuous segments and large bifurcating vessels.\nCharacterization of coronary flow using a dynamically scaled PC-MRI phantom flow is feasible and provides higher resolution than current in vivo or true-scale in vitro methods, and may be used to provide boundary conditions for true-scale CFD simulations.

The C(4) D used in this setup proved to have a smaller contribution to the peak broadening than ESI-MS, which allowed that a C(4) D, positioned at 12 cm from the inlet of an 80-cm-long capillary, could be used to foresee position and shape of the peaks being formed 6.8 times slower at the ESI-MS electropherogram.", "journal": "Electrophoresis", "date": "2016-03-31", "authors": ["Kelliton Jos\u00e9 Mendon\u00e7aFrancisco", "Claudimir Luciodo Lago"], "doi": "10.1002/elps.201600005"}

{"title": "3D printing of liquid metals as fugitive inks for fabrication of 3D microfluidic channels.", "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a simple method to fabricate 3D microchannels and microvasculature at room temperature by direct-writing liquid metal as a sacrificial template. The formation of a surface oxide skin on the low-viscosity liquid metal stabilizes the shape of the printed metal for planar and out-of-plane structures. The printed structures can be embedded in a variety of soft (e.g. elastomeric) and rigid (e.g. thermoset) polymers. Both acid and electrochemical reduction are capable of removing the oxide skin that forms on the metal, which destabilizes the ink so that it withdraws from the encapsulating material due to capillary forces, resulting in nearly full recovery of the fugitive ink at room temperature. Whereas conventional fabrication procedures typically confine microchannels to 2D planes, the geometry of the printed microchannels can be varied from a simple 2D network to complex 3D architectures without using lithography. The method produces robust monolithic structures without the need for any bonding or assembling techniques that often limit the materials of construction of conventional microchannels. Removing select portions of the metal leaves behind 3D metal features that can be used as antennas, interconnects, or electrodes for interfacing with lab-on-a-chip devices.

A customized bolus, 5mm in thickness, was fabricated based on reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images. The bolus was printed on a Dimension 1200 series SST 3D printer. Repeat CT-based simulation indicated an acceptable fit of the 3D-printed bolus to the target region, with a maximum air gap of less than 5mm at the tragus. Most of the surface area of the target region was covered by the 95% isodose line. The plan with the 3D-printed bolus improved target coverage compared to that without a bolus.

{"title": "3-D Printed Adjustable Microelectrode Arrays for Electrochemical Sensing and Biosensing.", "abstract": "Printed Electronics has emerged as an important fabrication technique that overcomes several shortcomings of conventional lithography and provides custom rapid prototyping for various sensor applications. In this work, silver microelectrode arrays (MEA) with three different electrode spacing were fabricated using 3-D printing by the aerosol jet technology. The microelectrodes were printed at a length scale of about 15 \u03bcm, with the space between the electrodes accurately controlled to about 2 times (30 \u03bcm, MEA30), 6.6 times (100 \u03bcm, MEA100) and 12 times (180 \u03bcm, MEA180) the trace width, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide and glucose were chosen as model analytes to demonstrate the performance of the MEA for sensor applications. The electrodes are shown to reduce hydrogen peroxide with a reduction current proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide for certain concentration ranges. Further, the sensitivity of the current for the three electrode configurations was shown to decrease with an increase in the microelectrode spacing (sensitivity of MEA30: MEA100: MEA180 was in the ratio of 3.7: 2.8: 1), demonstrating optimal MEA geometry for such applications. The noise of the different electrode configurations is also characterized and shows a dramatic reduction from MEA30 to MEA100 and MEA180 electrodes. Further, it is shown that the response current is proportional to MEA100 and MEA180 electrode areas, but not for the area of MEA30 electrode (the current density of MEA30 : MEA100 : MEA180 is 0.25 : 1 : 1), indicating that the MEA30 electrodes suffer from diffusion overlap from neighboring electrodes. The work thus establishes the lower limit of microelectrode spacing for our geometry. The lowest detection limit of the MEAs was calculated (with S/N = 3) to be 0.45 \u03bcM.

While benchtop laboratory sample application and detection systems for TLC provide accurate quantitation of TLC spot positions and densities, there are many applications where inexpensive and portable instruments would greatly expand the applicability of the technology. In this work, we demonstrate identity verification and concentration determination of pharmaceutical compounds via TLC using a custom 3D-printed cradle that interfaces with an ordinary mobile phone. The cradle holds the mobile phone's internal, rear-facing camera in a fixed position relative to a UV lamp and a TLC plate that includes a phosphor in the stationary phase. Analysis of photographs thus reveals the locations and intensities of principal spots of UV--absorbing drugs. Automated image analysis software determines the center location and density of dark spots, which, using integrated calibration spots of known drug compounds and concentrations, can be used to determine if a drug has been diluted or substituted. Two independent image processing approaches have been developed that may be selected based upon the processing capabilities of the smartphone. Each approach is able to discern 5% drug concentration differences.

{"title": "Pharmacokinetic profile that reduces nephrotoxicity of gentamicin in a perfused kidney-on-a-chip.", "abstract": "Nephrotoxicity is often underestimated because renal clearance in animals is higher compared to in humans. This paper aims to illustrate the potential to fill in such pharmacokinetic gaps between animals and humans using a microfluidic kidney model. As an initial demonstration, we compare nephrotoxicity of a drug, administered at the same total dosage, but using different pharmacokinetic regimens. Kidney epithelial cell, cultured under physiological shear stress conditions, are exposed to gentamicin using regimens that mimic the pharmacokinetics of bolus injection or continuous infusion in humans. The perfusion culture utilized is important both for controlling drug exposure and for providing cells with physiological shear stress (1.0 dyn cm(-2)). Compared to static cultures, perfusion culture improves epithelial barrier function. We tested two drug treatment regimens that give the same gentamycin dose over a 24 h period. In one regimen, we mimicked drug clearance profiles for human bolus injection by starting cell exposure at 19.2 mM of gentamicin and reducing the dosage level by half every 2 h over a 24 h period. In the other regimen, we continuously infused gentamicin (3 mM for 24 h). Although junctional protein immunoreactivity was decreased with both regimens, ZO-1 and occludin fluorescence decreased less with the bolus injection mimicking regimen. The bolus injection mimicking regimen also led to less cytotoxicity and allowed the epithelium to maintain low permeability, while continuous infusion led to an increase in cytotoxicity and permeability. These data show that gentamicin disrupts cell-cell junctions, increases membrane permeability, and decreases cell viability particularly with prolonged low-level exposure. Importantly a bolus injection mimicking regimen alleviates much of the nephrotoxicity compared to the continuous infused regimen. In addition to potential relevance to clinical gentamicin administration regimens, the results are important in demonstrating the general potential of using microfluidic cell culture models for pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-03-25", "authors": ["SejoongKim", "Sasha CaiLesherPerez", "Byoung Choul CKim", "CameronYamanishi", "Joseph MLabuz", "BrendanLeung", "ShuichiTakayama"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015021"}

However, injection of dispersed cells is not optimal to ensure precise homing into the recipient's vasculature. Implantation of cell-engineered scaffolds around the occluded artery may obviate these limitations. Here, we employed the synthetic polymer polycaprolactone for fabrication of 3D woodpile- or channel-shaped scaffolds by a computer-assisted writing system (pressure assisted micro-syringe square), followed by deposition of gelatin (GL) nanofibers by electro-spinning. Scaffolds were then cross-linked with natural (genipin, GP) or synthetic (3-glycidyloxy-propyl-trimethoxy-silane, GPTMS) agents to improve mechanical properties and durability in vivo. The composite scaffolds were next fixed by crown inserts in each well of a multi-well plate and seeded with adventitial progenitor cells (APCs, 3 cell lines in duplicate), which were isolated/expanded from human saphenous vein surgical leftovers. Cell density, alignment, proliferation and viability were assessed 1 week later. Data from in vitro assays showed channel-shaped/GPTMS-crosslinked scaffolds confer APCs with best alignment and survival/growth characteristics. Based on these results, channel-shaped/GPTMS-crosslinked scaffolds with or without APCs were implanted around the femoral artery of mice with unilateral limb ischemia. Perivascular implantation of scaffolds accelerated limb blood flow recovery, as assessed by laser Doppler or fluorescent microspheres, and increased arterial collaterals around the femoral artery and in limb muscles compared with non-implanted controls.

This paper presents the first report of a novel surface suspension melt technique to fabricate a micro-porous thin membrane scaffolds without using any organic solvent. Briefly, a layer of polycaprolactone (PCL) particles is directly spread on top of water in the form of a suspension. After that, with the use of heat, the powder layer is transformed into a melted layer, and following cooling, a thin membrane is obtained. Two different sizes of PCL powder particles (100 \u00b5m and 500 \u00b5m) are used.

{"title": "Wireless Data Acquisition of Transient Signals for Mobile Spectrometry Applications.", "abstract": "Wireless data acquisition using smartphones or handhelds offers increased mobility, it provides reduced size and weight, it has low electrical power requirements, and (in some cases) it has an ability to access the internet. Thus, it is well suited for mobile spectrometry applications using miniaturized, field-portable spectrometers, or detectors for chemical analysis in the field (i.e., on-site). There are four main wireless communications standards that can be used for wireless data acquisition, namely ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and UWB (ultra-wide band). These are briefly reviewed and are evaluated for applicability to data acquisition of transient signals (i.e., time-domain) in the field (i.e., on-site) from a miniaturized, field-portable photomultiplier tube detector and from a photodiode array detector installed in a miniaturized, field-portable fiber optic spectrometer. These are two of the most widely used detectors for optical measurements in the ultraviolet-visible range of the spectrum. A miniaturized, 3D-printed, battery-operated microplasma-on-a-chip was used for generation of transient optical emission signals. Elemental analysis from liquid microsamples, a microplasma, and a handheld or a smartphone will be used as examples. Development and potential applicability of wireless data acquisition of transient optical emission signals for taking part of the lab to the sample types of mobile, field-portable spectrometry applications will be discussed.

Herein we describe the development of a handheld biofabrication tool, dubbed the 'biopen', which enables the deposition of living cells and biomaterials in a manual, direct-write fashion. A gelatin-methacrylamide/hyaluronic acid-methacrylate (GelMa/HAMa) hydrogel was printed and UV crosslinked during the deposition process to generate surgically sculpted 3D structures. Custom titanium nozzles were fabricated to allow printing of multiple ink formulations in a collinear (side-by-side) geometry. Independently applied extrusion pressure for both chambers allows for geometric control of the printed structure and for the creation of compositional gradients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that human adipose stem cells maintain high viability (>97%) one week after biopen printing in GelMa/HAMa hydrogels. The biopen described in this study paves the way for the use of 3D bioprinting during the surgical process.

Through the creation of negative pressure, GAE aspirates prefabricated highly hydrated collagen gels into a needle, simultaneously inducing compaction and meso-scale anisotropy (i.e., fibrillar alignment) on the gels, and by subsequent reversal of the pressure, I-DC gels can be controllably ejected. The system generates I-DC gels with CFDs ranging from 5 to 32 wt%, controlling the initial scaffold microstructure, anisotropy, hydraulic permeability, and mechanical properties. These features could potentially enable the minimally invasive delivery of more stable hydrogels. The viability, metabolic activity, and differentiation of seeded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was investigated in the I-DC gels of distinct CFDs and extents of anisotropy produced through two different gauge needles. MSC osteoblastic differentiation was found to be relatively accelerated in I-DC gels that combined physiologically relevant CFDs and increased fibrillar alignment.

This review article summarizes progress with 3D printed drug products and discusses process development for solid oral dosage forms. 3D printing is a layer-by-layer process capable of producing 3D drug products from digital designs. Traditional pharmaceutical processes, such as tablet compression, have been used for decades with established regulatory pathways. These processes are well understood, but antiquated in terms of process capability and manufacturing flexibility. 3D printing, as a platform technology, has competitive advantages for complex products, personalized products, and products made on-demand. These advantages create opportunities for improving the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of medicines. Although 3D printing differs from traditional manufacturing processes for solid oral dosage forms, risk-based process development is feasible. This review highlights how product and process understanding can facilitate the development of a control strategy for different 3D printing methods.

Here we described the fabrication and use of a fecal pellet electrochemical sensor that can be used to simultaneously detect the release of luminal 5-HT and colonic motility. Fecal pellet sensor devices were fabricated using carbon nanotube composite electrodes that were housed in 3D printed components in order to generate a device that had shape and size that mimicked a natural fecal pellet. Devices were fabricated where varying regions of the pellet contained the electrode. Devices showed that they were stable and sensitive for ex vivo detection of 5-HT, and no differences in the fecal pellet velocity was observed when compared to natural fecal pellets. The onset of mucosal 5-HT was observed prior to the movement of the fecal pellet. The release of mucosal 5-HT occurred oral to the fecal pellet and was linked to the contraction of the bowel wall that drove pellet propulsion. Taken, together these findings provide new insights into the role of mucosal 5-HT and suggest that the transmitter acts as a key initiator of fecal pellet propulsion.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-03-24", "authors": ["RachelMorris", "AidanFagan-Murphy", "Sarah JMacEachern", "DerekCovill", "Bhavik AnilPatel"], "doi": "10.1038/srep23442"}

{"title": "Long-term osseointegration of 3D printed CoCr constructs with an interconnected open-pore architecture prepared by electron beam melting.", "abstract": "In orthopaedic surgery, cobalt chromium (CoCr) based alloys are used extensively for their high strength and wear properties, but with concerns over stress shielding and bone resorption due to the high stiffness of CoCr. The structural stiffness, principally related to the bulk and the elastic modulus of the material, may be lowered by appropriate design modifications, to reduce the stiffness mismatch between metal/alloy implants and the adjacent bone. Here, 3D printed CoCr and Ti6Al4V implants of similar macro-geometry and interconnected open-pore architecture prepared by electron beam melting (EBM) were evaluated following 26week implantation in adult sheep femora. Despite higher total bone-implant contact for Ti6Al4V (39\u00b14%) than CoCr (27\u00b14%), bone formation patterns were similar, e.g., densification around the implant, and gradual ingrowth into the porous network, with more bone in the outer half (periphery) than the inner half (centre). Raman spectroscopy revealed no major differences in mineral crystallinity, the apatite-to-collagen ratio, or the carbonate-to-phosphate ratio. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed similar Ca/P ratio of the interfacial tissue adjacent to both materials. Osteocytes made direct contact with CoCr and Ti6Al4V. While osteocyte density and distribution in the new-formed bone were largely similar for the two alloys, higher osteocyte density was observed at the periphery of the porous network for CoCr, attributable to slower remodelling and a different biomechanical environment. The results demonstrate the possibility to achieve bone ingrowth into open-pore CoCr constructs, and attest to the potential for fabricating customised osseointegrated CoCr implants for load-bearing applications.\nAlthough cobalt chromium (CoCr) based alloys are used extensively in orthopaedic surgery, stress shielding due to the high stiffness of CoCr is of concern. To reduce the stiffness mismatch between CoCr and bone, CoCr and Ti6Al4V implants having an interconnected open-pore architecture were prepared by electron beam melting (EBM). After six months of submerged healing in sheep, both alloys showed similar patterns of bone formation, with densification around the implant and gradual ingrowth into the porous network.

{"title": "Structure, Properties, and In Vitro Behavior of Heat-Treated Calcium Sulfate Scaffolds Fabricated by 3D Printing.", "abstract": "The ability of inkjet-based 3D printing (3DP) to fabricate biocompatible ceramics has made it one of the most favorable techniques to generate bone tissue engineering (BTE) scaffolds. Calcium sulfates exhibit various beneficial characteristics, and they can be used as a promising biomaterial in BTE. However, low mechanical performance caused by the brittle character of ceramic materials is the main weakness of 3DP calcium sulfate scaffolds. Moreover, the presence of certain organic matters in the starting powder and binder solution causes products to have high toxicity levels. A post-processing treatment is usually employed to improve the physical, chemical, and biological behaviors of the printed scaffolds. In this study, the effects of heat treatment on the structural, mechanical, and physical characteristics of 3DP calcium sulfate prototypes were investigated. Different microscopy and spectroscopy methods were employed to characterize the printed prototypes. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the specimens was also evaluated before and after heat treatment. Results showed that the as-printed scaffolds and specimens heat treated at 300\u00b0C exhibited severe toxicity in vitro but had almost adequate strength. By contrast, the specimens heat treated in the 500\u00b0C-1000\u00b0C temperature range, although non-toxic, had insufficient mechanical strength, which was mainly attributed to the exit of the organic binder before 500\u00b0C and the absence of sufficient densification below 1000\u00b0C. The sintering process was accelerated at temperatures higher than 1000\u00b0C, resulting in higher compressive strength and less cytotoxicity. An anhydrous form of calcium sulfate was the only crystalline phase existing in the samples heated at 500\u00b0C-1150\u00b0C. The formation of calcium oxide caused by partial decomposition of calcium sulfate was observed in the specimens heat treated at temperatures higher than 1200\u00b0C. Although considerable improvements in cell viability of heat-treated scaffolds were observed in this study, the mechanical properties were not significantly improved, requiring further investigations.

The creation of TM grafts by multi-material three-dimensional (3D) printing may overcome limitations of current graft materials, e.g. temporalis muscle fascia, used for surgical reconstruction of the TM. TM graft scaffolds with either 8 or 16 circumferential and radial filament arrangements were fabricated by 3D printing of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), flex-polyactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) materials followed by uniform infilling with a fibrin-collagen composite hydrogel. Digital opto-electronic holography (DOEH) and laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) were used to measure acoustic properties including surface motions and velocity of TM grafts in response to sound. Mechanical properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Results were compared to fresh cadaveric human TMs and cadaveric temporalis fascia. Similar to the human TM, TM grafts exhibit simple surface motion patterns at lower frequencies (400\u00a0Hz), with a limited number of displacement maxima. At higher frequencies (>1000\u00a0Hz), their displacement patterns are highly organized with multiple areas of maximal displacement separated by regions of minimal displacement. By contrast, temporalis fascia exhibited asymmetric and less regular holographic patterns. Velocity across frequency sweeps (0.2-10\u00a0kHz) measured by LDV demonstrated consistent results for 3D printed grafts, while velocity for human fascia varied greatly between specimens. TM composite grafts of different scaffold print materials and varied filament count (8 or 16) displayed minimal, but measurable differences in DOEH and LDV at tested frequencies. TM graft mechanical load increased with higher filament count and is resilient over time, which differs from temporalis fascia, which loses over 70% of its load bearing properties during mechanical testing. This study demonstrates the design, fabrication and preliminary in\u00a0vitro acoustic and mechanical evaluation of 3D printed TM grafts.

{"title": "Effects of electromagnetic field frequencies on chondrocytes in 3D cell-printed composite constructs.", "abstract": "In cartilage tissue engineering, electromagnetic field (EMF) therapy has been reported to have a modest effect on promoting cartilage regeneration. However, these studies were conducted using different frequencies of EMF to stimulate chondrocytes. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the effect of EMF frequency on cartilage formation. In addition to the stimulation, a scaffold is required to satisfy the characteristics of cartilage such as its hydrated and dense extracellular matrix, and a mechanical resilience to applied loads. Therefore, we 3D-printed a composite construct composed of a polymeric framework and a chondrocyte-laden hydrogel. Here, we observed frequency-dependent positive and negative effects on chondrogenesis using a 3D cell-printed cartilage tissue. We found that a frequency of 45 Hz promoted gene expression and secretion of extracellular matrix molecules of chondrocytes. In contrast, a frequency of 7.5 Hz suppressed chondrogenic differentiation in vitro. Additionally, the EMF-treated composite constructs prior to implantation showed consistent results with those of in vitro, suggesting that in vitro pre-treatment with different EMF frequencies provides different capabilities for the enhancement of cartilage formation in vivo. This correlation between EMF frequency and 3D-printed chondrocytes suggests the necessity for optimization of EMF parameters when this physical stimulus is applied to engineered cartilage. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our research study group took advantage of new methods for rapid prototyping (i.\u200ae. 3D printing) to design and test an overtube system with two manipulator arms at the tip.\u200aBoth arms can be steered independently from each other by a dedicated user platform.\nThis animal study involved a randomized evaluation of the new overtube device for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) compared with a conventionally performed ESD. In total, 12 ESDs in six pigs were performed. Six ESDs were performed in the stomach and six in the colon. Size (in cm(2)) of resected specimens, the time needed to perform endoscopic resection, and adverse events were assessed.\nThe overtube-assisted ESD was faster and therefore more effective than the conventional ESD technique (0.45\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.24\u200acm(2)/min vs. 0.22\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.11\u200acm(2)/min; P\u200a=\u200a0.029).

The production of novel polylactic acid and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose based feed materials containing nitrofurantoin for 3D printing purposes is demonstrated. Nitrofurantoin, Metolose\u00ae and polylactic acid were successfully co-extruded with up to 40% Metolose\u00ae content, and subsequently 3D printed into model disk geometries (\u00f810mm, h=2mm). Thermal analysis with differential scanning calorimetry and solid phase identification with Raman spectroscopy showed that nitrofurantoin remained in its original solid form during both hot-melt extrusion and subsequent 3D printing. Rheological measurements of the different compositions showed that the flow properties were sensitive to the amount of undissolved particles present in the formulation. Release of nitrofurantoin from the disks was dependent on Metolose\u00ae loading, with higher accumulated release observed for higher Metolose\u00ae loads.

MC-based hydrogels were prepared by a dispersion technique, mixing MC powder (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 % w/v) with selected salts (sodium sulphate, Na2SO4), sodium phosphate, calcium chloride, or phosphate buffered saline, to evaluate the influence of different compositions on the thermo-responsive behavior. The inversion test was used to determine the gelation temperatures of the different hydrogel compositions; thermo-mechanical properties and thermo-reversibility of the MC hydrogels were investigated by rheological analysis. Gelation temperatures and rheological behavior depended on the MC concentration and type and concentration of salt used in hydrogel preparation. In vitro cytotoxicity tests, performed using L929 mouse fibroblasts, showed no toxic release from all the tested hydrogels. Among the investigated compositions, the hydrogel composed of 8 % w/v MC with 0.05 M Na2SO4 had a thermo-reversibility temperature at 37 \u00b0C. For that reason, this formulation was thus considered to verify the possibility of inducing in vitro spontaneous detachment of cells previously seeded on the hydrogel surface. A continuous cell layer (cell sheet) was allowed to grow and then detached from the hydrogel surface without the use of enzymes, thanks to the thermo-responsive behavior of the MC hydrogel. Immunofluorescence observation confirmed that the detached cell sheet was composed of closely interacting cells.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

According to the literature the reasons are inexact fitting of the prosthesis or too few anatomically formed implants resulting in less physiological kinematics of the knee joint. Reducing the number of dissatisfied patients and the corresponding number of revisions is an important goal considering the increasing need for artificial joints. In this context, patient-specific knee implants are an obvious alternative to conventional implants. For the first time implants are now matched to the individual bone and not vice versa to achieve the best possible individual situation and geometry and more structures (e.g. ligaments and bone) are preserved or only those structures are replaced which were actually destroyed by arthrosis. According to the authors view, this represents an optimal and pioneering addition to conventional implants. Patient-specific implants and the instruments needed for correct alignment and fitting can be manufactured by virtual 3D reconstruction and 3D printing based on computed tomography (CT) scans. The portfolio covers medial as well as lateral unicondylar implants, medial as well as lateral bicompartmental implants (femorotibial and patellofemoral compartments) and cruciate ligament-preserving as well as cruciate ligament-substituting total knee replacements; however, it must be explicitly emphasized that the literature is sparse and no long-term data are available.", "journal": "Der Orthopade", "date": "2016-03-18", "authors": ["JBeckmann", "ASteinert", "CZilkens", "AZeh", "CSchnurr", "MSchmitt-Sody", "MGebauer"], "doi": "10.1007/s00132-016-3237-x"}

Our first aim was to use preoperative templating and 3D printed model characterise the technical difficulties associated with use of current commercially available intramedullary nail (IMN) systems for the management of AFFs with severe bowing. Our second aim was to use outcomes of our 3D printing analysis to define technical criteria to overcome these problems.\nThe modelled femur with 3D printing had an anterior bowing curvature radius of 772mm and an angle of lateral bowing of 15.4\u00b0. Nine commercially available IMN systems were evaluated in terms of position of the nail within the medullary canal, occurrence of perforation of femoral cortex by the distal tip of the nail, and location of the site of perforation relative to the knee joint. The following IMN systems were evaluated: unreamed femoral nail (UFN), cannulated femoral nail (CFN), Sirus nail, right and left expert Asian femoral nail (A2FN), right and left Zimmer Natural Nail (ZNN), proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), and Zimmer Cephalomedullary Nail (CMN).\nAlong the sagittal plane, the UFN, CFN and Sirus systems were acceptably contained within the medullary canal, as well as the \"opposite side\" A2FN and ZNN. Only the Sirus IMN system was contained along the coronal plane. The distal part of the all other IMN systems perforated the anterior cortex of the femur, at distances ranging between 2.8 and 11.7cm above the distal end of the femoral condyles. Using simulated fracture reduction in the 3D printed model, none of the 9 IMN systems provided acceptable anatomical reduction of the fracture. A residual gap in fragment position and translation was provided by the \"opposite side\" ZNN, followed by the UFN and Sirus systems.\nCommercially available IMN systems showed mismatch with severely bowed femurs.

To improve the bone-implant interface, two strategies have been employed: to modify its surface or to impregnate PEEK with bioactive materials. This study attempts to combine and improve upon the two approaches by modifying the internal structure into a trabecular network and to impregnate PEEK with mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, we compare the newly designed PEEK scaffolds' interactions with both bone-derived (BMSC) and adipose (ADSC) stem cells.\nCustomized PEEK scaffolds were designed to incorporate a trabecular microstructure using a computer-aided design program and then printed via selective laser sintering (SLS), a 3D-printing process with exceptional accuracy. The scaffold structure was evaluated using microCT. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate scaffold morphology with and without mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Adipose and bone marrow mesenchymal cells were isolated from rats and cultured on scaffolds. Cell proliferation and differentiation were assessed using alamarBlue and alkaline phosphatase assays, respectively. Cell morphology after one week of co-culturing cells with PEEK scaffolds was evaluated using SEM.\nSLS 3D printing fabricated scaffolds with a porosity of 36.38%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.66 and density of 1.309\u2009g/cm(2). Cell morphology resembled viable fibroblasts attaching to the surface and micropores of the scaffold.

Further animal experiments demonstrated the potential of as-modified implant scaffolds in practical clinical applications.

The verification of dose distribution in a small field becomes critical because of the obvious dose gradient within the field.

After irradiation, a 24 to 96 hour delay was applied, and the gel dosimeters were read by a cone beam optical computed tomography (optical CT) scanner.

In these studies, we investigate a versatile platform for functionalizing micro-3D-printed (\u03bc-3DP) protein hydrogels via multiphoton excitation of benzophenone-biotin, a photoactivatable ligand capable of reacting with the hydrogel matrix, which is subsequently linked to a biotinylated cell-adhesive peptide through a NeutrAvidin\u00ae bridge. This functionalization strategy is potentially applicable to a broad range of hydrogel platforms, enabling biomolecules to be precisely patterned at specified locations within 3D materials. As proof-of-concept of this strategy's utility, we demonstrate that chemical modifications can be made to \u03bc-3DP protein hydrogels that enable Schwann cells to be patterned without altering the mechanical or topographical properties of the hydrogel to an extent that influences SC cell adhesion. The ability to independently control potential cellular cues within in vitro cellular microenvironments is essential to investigating decoupled effects of biomaterial properties on cell-matrix interactions.

{"title": "Influencing chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells in scaffolds displaying a structural gradient in pore size.", "abstract": "Articular cartilage lesions have a limited ability to heal by themselves. Yet, golden standard treatments for cartilage repair such as drilling, microfracture and mosaicplasty provide further damage and an unstable solution that degenerates into fibrocartilage in time. Articular cartilage presents a number of gradients in cell number and size along with structural gradients in extra cellular matrix (ECM) composition. Therefore, creating scaffolds that display a structural gradient can be an appealing strategy for cartilage tissue regeneration treatments. In the present study, a scaffold with an in-built discrete gradient in pore size was produced by additive manufacturing. Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were seeded within the gradient scaffolds and their proliferation, differentiation and ECM deposition was evaluated with respect to 2 non-gradient scaffolds. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) deposition was significantly higher in gradient scaffolds and non-gradient scaffolds with the smallest pore size compared to non-gradient scaffolds with the largest pore size. A gradual increase of chondrogenic markers was observed within the gradient structures with decreasing pore size, which was also accompanied by an increasingly compact ECM formation. Therefore, scaffolds displaying a structural gradient in pore size seem to be a promising strategy to aid in the process of hMSC chondrogenic differentiation and could be considered for improved cartilage tissue regeneration applications.\nWe present the development of a novel hierarchical scaffold obtained by additive manufacturing. Structural hierarchy is obtained by changing pore size within the pore network characterizing the fabricated scaffolds and proves to be a functional element in the scaffold to influence adult stem cell differentiation in the chondrogenic lineage. Specifically, in regions of the scaffolds presenting smaller pores an increasing differentiation of stem cells toward the chondrogenic differentiation is displayed. Taking inspiration from the zonal organization of articular cartilage tissue, pore size gradients could, therefore, be considered as a new and important element in designing 3D scaffolds for regenerative medicine applications, in particular for all those tissues where gradient physical properties are present.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-03-13", "authors": ["AndreaDi Luca", "KarolSzlazak", "IvanLorenzo-Moldero", "Corina AGhebes", "AntonioLepedda", "WojcechSwieszkowski", "ClemensVan Blitterswijk", "LorenzoMoroni"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.03.014"}

This investigation describes the simultaneous isolation, characterization, growth and function of primary mammary epithelial cells (MEC), mesenchymal cells (MES) and adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) from four normal breasts, one inflammatory and one triple-negative ductal breast tumors.\nA total of 17 cell lines were established and gene expression was analyzed for MEC and MES (n\u2009=\u200942) and ADSC (n\u2009=\u200948) and MUC1, pan-KRT, CD90 and GATA-3 by immunofluorescence. DNA fingerprinting to track cell line identity was performed between original primary tissues and isolates. Functional studies included ADSC differentiation, tumor MES and MEC invasion co-cultured with ADSC-conditioned media (CM) and MES adhesion and growth on 3D-printed scaffolds.\nComparative analysis showed higher gene expression of EPCAM, CD49f, CDH1 and KRTs for normal MEC lines; MES lines e.g. Vimentin, CD10, ACTA2 and MMP9; and ADSC lines e.g. CD105, CD90, CDH2 and CDH11. Compared to the mean of all four normal breast cell lines, both breast tumor cell lines demonstrated significantly lower ADSC marker gene expression, but higher expression of mesenchymal and invasion gene markers like SNAI1 and MMP2. When compared with four normal ADSC differentiated lineages, both tumor ADSC showed impaired osteogenic and chondrogenic but enhanced adipogenic differentiation and endothelial-like structures, possibly due to high PDGFRB and CD34. Addressing a functional role for overproduction of adipocytes, we initiated 3D-invasion studies including different cell types from the same patient. CM from ADSC differentiating into adipocytes induced tumor MEC 3D-invasion via EMT and amoeboid phenotypes. Normal MES breast cells adhered and proliferated on 3D-printed scaffolds containing 20 fibers, but not on 2.5D-printed scaffolds with single fiber layers, important for tissue engineering.\nExpression analyses confirmed successful simultaneous cell isolations of three different phenotypes from normal and tumor primary breast tissues.

The ideal scaffold must fulfill several requirements such as having proper composition, targeted modulus, and well-defined architectural features. Biomaterials that recapitulate the intrinsic architecture of in vivo tissue are vital for studying diseases as well as to facilitate the regeneration of lost and malformed soft tissue. A novel biofabrication technique was developed which combines state of the art imaging, three-dimensional (3D) printing, and selective enzymatic activity to create a new generation of biomaterials for research and clinical application. The developed material, Bovine Serum Albumin rubber, is reaction injected into a mold that upholds specific geometrical features. This sacrificial material allows the adequate transfer of architectural features to a natural scaffold material. The prototype consists of a 3D collagen scaffold with 4 and 3 mm channels that represent a branched architecture.

Therefore, an infrared-laser-based test setup was developed to cure the silicone rubber materials rapidly and to evaluate the resulting spreading in relation to its initial viscosity, the absorbed infrared radiation, and the surface tensions of the fabrication bed's material. Different low-adhesion materials (polyimide, Parylene-C, polytetrafluoroethylene, and fluorinated ethylenepropylene) were used as bed materials to reduce the spreading of the silicone rubber materials by means of their well-known weak surface tensions. Further, O2-plasma treatment was performed on the bed materials to reduce the surface tensions. To calculate the absorbed radiation, the emittance of the laser was measured, and the absorptances of the materials were investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection mode.

Pulse lengths ranging from femtoseconds to nanoseconds are utilized at varying laser beam energies and pulse lengths, and enable the removal of nanometric volumes of material. While the mechanisms for removal of material by laser irradiation, i.e., laser ablation, are well understood on the micrometer length scale, it was previously impossible to directly observe obliteration processes on smaller scales due to experimental limitations for the combination of nanometer spatial and nanosecond temporal resolution. Here, we report the direct observation of metal thin film ablation from a solid substrate through dynamic transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative analysis reveals liquid-phase dewetting of the thin-film, followed by hydrodynamic sputtering of nano- to submicron sized metal droplets. We discovered unexpected fracturing of the substrate due to evolving thermal stresses.

These machines need to be safe, effective, and easy to control. One strategy towards accomplishing these goals is to build the robots using soft and flexible materials to make them much more approachable and less likely to damage their environment. A major challenge is that comparatively little is known about how best to design, fabricate and control deformable machines. Here we describe the design, fabrication and control of a novel soft robotic platform (Softworms) as a modular device for research, education and public outreach. These robots are inspired by recent neuromechanical studies of crawling and climbing by larval moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera, caterpillars). Unlike most soft robots currently under development, the Softworms do not rely on pneumatic or fluidic actuators but are electrically powered and actuated using either shape-memory alloy microcoils or motor tendons, and they can be modified to accept other muscle-like actuators such as electroactive polymers. The technology is extremely versatile, and different designs can be quickly and cheaply fabricated by casting elastomeric polymers or by direct 3D printing. Softworms can crawl, inch or roll, and they are steerable and even climb steep inclines. Softworms can be made in any shape but here we describe modular and monolithic designs requiring little assembly. These modules can be combined to make multi-limbed devices. We also describe two approaches for controlling such highly deformable structures using either model-free state transition-reward matrices or distributed, mechanically coupled oscillators.

Immediately following surgical repair, a congenital cardiac surgeon and an intensive care physician conducted a simulation training session regarding postoperative care utilizing the patient-specific 3D model for the PCICU team. After the simulation, Likert-type 0 to 10 scale questionnaire assessed participant perception of impact of the training session.\nSeventy clinicians participated in training sessions, including 22 physicians, 38 nurses, and 10 ancillary care providers. Average response to whether 3D models were more helpful than standard hand off was 8.4 of 10. Questions regarding enhancement of understanding and clinical ability received average responses of 9.0 or greater, and 90% of participants scored 8 of 10 or higher. Nurses scored significantly higher than other clinicians on self-reported familiarity with the surgery (7.1 vs. 5.8; P = .04), clinical management ability (8.6 vs. 7.7; P = .02), and ability enhancement (9.5 vs. 8.7; P = .02). Compared to physicians, nurses and ancillary providers were more likely to consider 3D models more helpful than standard hand off (8.7 vs. 7.7; P = .05). Higher case complexity predicted greater enhancement of understanding of surgery (P = .04).\nThe 3D heart models can be used to enhance congenital cardiac critical care via simulation training of multidisciplinary intensive care teams.

Conditions leading to micro-cracking susceptibility of the coating have been investigated using the finite element based modelling supported by experimental results of microscopic investigation of the sample coatings. Consecutive temperature and stress peaks are developed within the cladded material as a result of the laser beam moving along the complex trajectory, which can lead to micro-cracking. The preheated to 500\u00b0C base plate allowed for decrease of the laser power and lowering of the cooling speed between the consecutive temperature peaks contributing in such way to achievement of lower cracking susceptibility. The cooling rate during cladding of the second and the third layer was lower than during cladding of the first one, in such way, contributing towards improvement of cracking resistance of the subsequent layers due to progressive accumulation of heat over the process.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2016-03-10", "authors": ["MichalKrzyzanowski", "SzymonBajda", "YijunLiu", "AndrewTriantaphyllou", "WMark Rainforth", "MalcolmGlendenning"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.02.023"}

In this study, porous magnesium was implemented in a scaffold that closely mimics the mechanical properties of human bones with a controlled degradation rate and shows good biocompatibility to match the regeneration rate of bone tissue at the affected site. The alumina-reinforced Mg scaffold was produced by spark plasma sintering and coated with magnesium fluoride (MgF2) using a hydrofluoric acid solution to regulate the corrosion rate under physiological conditions. Sodium chloride granules (NaCl), acting as space holders, were leached out to achieve porous samples (60%) presenting an average pore size of 240 \u03bcm with complete pore interconnectivity. When the alumina content increased from 0 to 5 vol%, compressive strength and stiffness rose considerably from 9.5 to 13.8 MPa and from 0.24 to 0.40 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the biological response evaluated by in vitro cell test and blood test of the MgF2-coated porous Mg composite was enhanced with better corrosion resistance compared with that of uncoated counterparts.

Recently, ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI sequences have been developed that allow radiation-free imaging of facial bones. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility of UTE MRI sequences for medical additive manufacturing (AM).\nThree morphologically different dry human mandibles were scanned using a CT and MRI scanner. Additionally, optical scans of all three mandibles were made to acquire a \"gold standard\". All CT and MRI scans were converted into Standard Tessellation Language (STL) models and geometrically compared with the gold standard. To quantify the accuracy of the AM process, the CT, MRI and gold-standard STL models of one of the mandibles were additively manufactured, optically scanned and compared with the original gold-standard STL model.\nGeometric differences between all three CT-derived STL models and the gold standard were <1.0\u2009mm. All three MRI-derived STL models generally presented deviations <1.5\u2009mm in the symphyseal and mandibular area. The AM process introduced minor deviations of <0.5\u2009mm.\nThis study demonstrates that MRI using UTE sequences is a feasible alternative to CT in generating STL models of the mandible and would therefore be suitable for surgical planning and AM.

{"title": "Study of Impingement Types and Printing Quality during Laser Printing of Viscoelastic Alginate Solutions.", "abstract": "Laser-induced forward transfer-based laser printing has been being implemented as a promising orifice-free direct-write strategy for different printing applications. The printing quality during laser printing is largely affected by the jet and droplet formation process and subsequential impingement. The objective of this study is to investigate the impingement-based printing type and resulting printing quality during the laser printing of viscoelastic alginate solutions, which are representative inks for soft structure printing such as bioprinting. Three printing types are identified: droplet-impingement printing, jet-impingement printing with multiple breakups, and jet-impingement printing with a single breakup. Printing quality, in terms of printed droplet morphology and size, has been investigated as a function of alginate concentration, laser fluence, and direct-writing height based on a time-resolved imaging approach and microarrays of printed droplets. Of these, the best printing quality is achieved with single-breakup jet-impingement printing, followed by multiple-breakup jet-impingement printing, with droplet-impingement printing producing the lowest quality printing. The printing quality can be improved by using high-concentration alginate solutions. The increase of laser fluence may lead to a well-defined primary droplet for low-concentration alginate solutions; however, this can cause the droplet diameter to increase, which may not be desirable. The direct-writing height (i.e., ribbon coating-receiving substrate distance) also influences the print quality. For example, an increase in direct-writing height can cause the printing type to change from the ideal jet-impingement with a single breakup, to the jet-impingement with multiple breakups, and even the least desired droplet-impingement printing, with only slight variations in droplet diameter.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["ZhengyiZhang", "RuitongXiong", "David TCorr", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00220"}

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20\u2009\u03bcm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood.

Although the internal porosity and pore size of 3D printed scaffolds have been frequently studied, the surface porosity and pore size, which are critical for cell infiltration and mass transport, have not been investigated. The surface geometry can differ considerably from the internal scaffold structure depending on the 3D printing process. It is vital to be able to control the surface geometry of scaffolds as well as the internal structure to fabricate optimal architectures. This work presents a method to control the surface porosity and pore size of 3D printed scaffolds. Six scaffold designs have been printed with surface porosities ranging from 3% to 21%. We have characterised the overall scaffold porosity and surface porosity using optical microscopy and microCT. It has been found that surface porosity has a significant impact on cell infiltration and proliferation. In addition, the porosity of the surface has been found to have an effect on mechanical properties and on the forces required to penetrate the scaffold with a surgical suturing needle.

Due to the strict technical limitations of current approaches, few materials are suitable for printing at low temperature. Here, a low-temperature robocasting method was employed to print biomimic 3D scaffolds for bone regeneration using a routine collagen-hydroxyapatite (CHA) composite material, which is too viscous to be printed via normal 3D printing methods at low temperature. The CHA scaffolds had excellent 3D structure and maintained most raw material properties after printing. Compared to nonprinted scaffolds, printed scaffolds promoted bone marrow stromal cell proliferation and improved osteogenic outcome in vitro.

Major progress has been achieved through the development of innovative biomanufacturing strategies to pattern and assemble cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) in three-dimensions (3D) to create functional tissue constructs. Bioprinting has emerged as a promising 3D biomanufacturing technology, enabling precise control over spatial and temporal distribution of cells and ECM. Bioprinting technology can be used to engineer artificial tissues and organs by producing scaffolds with controlled spatial heterogeneity of physical properties, cellular composition, and ECM organization. This innovative approach is increasingly utilized in biomedicine, and has potential to create artificial functional constructs for drug screening and toxicology research, as well as tissue and organ transplantation.

{"title": "Design considerations and challenges for mechanical stretch bioreactors in tissue engineering.", "abstract": "With the increase in average life expectancy and growing aging population, lack of functional grafts for replacement surgeries has become a severe problem. Engineered tissues are a promising alternative to this problem because they can mimic the physiological function of the native tissues and be cultured on demand. Cyclic stretch is important for developing many engineered tissues such as hearts, heart valves, muscles, and bones. Thus a variety of stretch bioreactors and corresponding scaffolds have been designed and tested to study the underlying mechanism of tissue formation and to optimize the mechanical conditions applied to the engineered tissues. In this review, we look at various designs of stretch bioreactors and common scaffolds and offer insights for future improvements in tissue engineering applications. First, we summarize the requirements and common configuration of stretch bioreactors. Next, we present the features of different actuating and motion transforming systems and their applications. Since most bioreactors must measure detailed distributions of loads and deformations on engineered tissues, techniques with high accuracy, precision, and frequency have been developed. We also cover the key points in designing culture chambers, nutrition exchanging systems, and regimens used for specific tissues. Since scaffolds are essential for providing biophysical microenvironments for residing cells, we discuss materials and technologies used in fabricating scaffolds to mimic anisotropic native tissues, including decellularized tissues, hydrogels, biocompatible polymers, electrospinning, and 3D bioprinting techniques. Finally, we present the potential future directions for improving stretch bioreactors and scaffolds. \u00a9 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

The objective of this study was to evaluate cellular response to three-dimensional (3D) porous Ti-6Al-4V constructs fabricated by additive manufacturing using laser sintering with low porosity (LP), medium porosity (MP), and high porosity (HP) with low resolution (LR) and high resolution (HR) based on a computed tomography scan of human trabecular bone. After surface processing, construct porosity ranged from 41.0% to 76.1%, but all possessed micro-/nanoscale surface roughness and similar surface chemistry containing mostly Ti, O, and C. Biological responses (osteoblast differentiation, maturation, and local factor production) by MG63 osteoblast-like cells and normal human osteoblasts favored 3D than two-dimensional (2D) solid constructs. First, MG63 cells were used to assess differences in cell response to 2D compared to LR and HR porous 3D constructs. MG63 cells were sensitive to porosity resolution and exhibited increased osteocalcin (OCN), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) on HR 3D constructs than on 2D and LR 3D constructs. MG63 cells also exhibited porosity-dependent responses on HR constructs, with up to a 6.9-fold increase in factor production on LP-HR and MP-HR constructs than on HP-HR constructs. NHOsts were then used to validate biological response on HR constructs. NHOsts exhibited decreased DNA content and alkaline phosphatase activity and up to a 2.9-fold increase in OCN, OPG, VEGF, BMP2, and BMP4 on 3D HR constructs than on 2D controls. These results indicate that osteoblasts prefer a 3D architecture than a 2D surface and that osteoblasts are sensitive to the resolution of trabecular detail and porosity parameters of laser-sintered 3D Ti-6Al-4V constructs.", "journal": "3D printing and additive manufacturing", "date": "2016-03-01", "authors": ["AliceCheng", "AizaHumayun", "Barbara DBoyan", "ZviSchwartz"], "doi": "10.1089/3dp.2015.0038"}

However, fabrication of predesigned collagen scaffolds using AM-based technologies is challenging due to the low viscosity of collagen solutions, gels or dispersions commonly used for scaffold preparation. In the present study, we have developed a straightforward method which is based on 3D plotting of a highly viscous, high density collagen dispersion. The swollen state of the collagen fibrils at pH 4 enabled the homogenous extrusion of the material, the deposition of uniform strands and finally the construction of 3D scaffolds. Stabilization of the plotted structures was achieved by freeze-drying and chemical crosslinking with the carbodiimide EDC. The scaffolds exhibited high shape and dimensional fidelity and a hierarchical porosity consisting of macropores generated by strand deposition as well as an interconnected microporosity within the strands as result of the freeze-drying process.

Considering that tissues and organs in the human body develop following specific physico-chemical gradients, in this study, we hypothesized that additive manufacturing (AM) technologies would significantly aid in the construction of 3D scaffolds encompassing such gradients. Specifically, we considered surface energy and stiffness gradients and analyzed their effect on adult bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into skeletal lineages. Discrete step-wise macroscopic gradients were obtained by sequentially depositing different biodegradable biomaterials in the AM process, namely poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)/poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEOT/PBT) copolymers. At the bulk level, PEOT/PBT homogeneous scaffolds supported a higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity compared to PCL, PLA, and gradient scaffolds, respectively. All homogeneous biomaterial scaffolds supported also a significantly higher amount of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) production compared to discrete gradient scaffolds. Interestingly, the analysis of the different material compartments revealed a specific contribution of PCL, PLA, and PEOT/PBT to surface energy gradients. Whereas PEOT/PBT regions were associated to significantly higher ALP activity, PLA regions correlated with significantly higher GAG production. These results show that cell activity could be influenced by the specific spatial distribution of different biomaterial chemistries in a 3D scaffold and that engineering surface energy discrete gradients could be considered as an appealing criterion to design scaffolds for osteochondral regeneration.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-03-01", "authors": ["AndreaDi Luca", "AlessiaLongoni", "GiuseppeCriscenti", "IvanLorenzo-Moldero", "MichelKlein-Gunnewiek", "JuliusVancso", "Clemensvan Blitterswijk", "CarlosMota", "LorenzoMoroni"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015014"}

This design ensures that their transition temperatures can be adjusted over a wide range by varying the composition of the middle block. The two St blocks at the chain ends can generate a crosslink network in the final device to achieve strong bonding force between building blocks and the shape memory capacity. Due to their thermoplastic properties, 3D printing was employed for the spatio-assembly to build devices. This method is capable of introducing many transition phases into one device and preparing complicated shapes via 3D printing. The device can perform a complex action via a series of shape changes.

The growth of this cheap and easy additive manufacturing technology in orthopedic, plastic, and vascular surgery has been explosive; however, its potential in the field of neurosurgery remains underexplored. A major limitation is that current technologies are unable to directly print ultrasoft materials like human brain tissue.\nIn this technical note, the authors present a new technology to create deformable, personalized models of the human brain.\nThe method combines 3D printing, molding, and casting to create a physiologically, anatomically, and tactilely realistic model based on magnetic resonance images. Created from soft gelatin, the model is easy to produce, cost-efficient, durable, and orders of magnitude softer than conventionally printed 3D models. The personalized brain model cost $50, and its fabrication took 24 hours.\nIn mechanical tests, the model stiffness (E\u00a0= 25.29 \u00b1 2.68 kPa) was 5 orders of magnitude softer than common 3D printed materials, and less than an order of magnitude stiffer than mammalian brain tissue (E\u00a0= 2.64 \u00b1 0.40 kPa).

This research aims to present advanced mesh manipulation techniques of stereolithographic (STL) files segmented from medical imaging and post-print surface optimization to match physiological vascular flow resistance. For phantom design, we developed three mesh manipulation techniques. The first method allows outlet 3D mesh manipulations to merge superfluous vessels into a single junction, decreasing the number of flow outlets and making it feasible to include smaller vessels. Next we introduced Boolean operations to eliminate the need to manually merge mesh layers and eliminate errors of mesh self-intersections that previously occurred. Finally we optimize support addition to preserve the patient anatomical geometry. For post-print surface optimization, we investigated various solutions and methods to remove support material and smooth the inner vessel surface. Solutions of chloroform, alcohol and sodium hydroxide were used to process various phantoms and hydraulic resistance was measured and compared with values reported in literature. The newly mesh manipulation methods decrease the phantom design time by 30 - 80% and allow for rapid development of accurate vascular models.

A python scripting library, the Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK), was used to segment the 3D geometry of the patient's cardiac chambers and mitral valve with severe stenosis, calcific in nature. A stereolithographic (STL) mesh was generated and AutoDesk Meshmixer was used to transform the vascular surface into a functioning closed flow loop. A Stratasys Objet 500 Connex3 multi-material printer was used to fabricate the phantom with distinguishable material features of the vasculature and calcified valve.

An Ex\u00a0Vivo Proof of Concept.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to introduce a novel method for accurate autotransplantation with computer-assisted guided templates and assembled custom-designed surgical tooling and to test the feasibility and accuracy of this method ex\u00a0vivo.\nA partially edentulous human mandibular cadaver was scanned with a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system and an intraoral scan system. The 3-dimensional (3D) data of this cadaver were imported into specialized software and used to analyze the region of the recipient site and the donor tooth was selected. Subsequently, congruent to the donor tooth, custom surgical tools and a surgical guided template were designed and 3D printed. The guided osteotomy was performed and the donor tooth was transplanted. To evaluate the planned position of the donor tooth in relation to the position of the transplanted donor tooth, the mandible with the transplanted donor tooth was rescanned with the CBCT system and software matching was applied to measure the accuracy of the procedure.\nThe angular deflection of the transplanted donor tooth in relation to the planned donor tooth position was 3.1\u00b0. When comparing the 3D positions of the shoulder, there was a deviation of 1.25\u00a0mm and an apical deviation of 0.89\u00a0mm.\nWith the use of currently available technology, it is feasible to accurately plan and create in a virtual simulation a donor tooth position with congruent custom surgical tools and to transfer this to a clinical setting with 3D printing.

{"title": "3D Surgical Printing Cutting Guides for Open-Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy: Do It Yourself.", "abstract": "Opening wedge osteotomy has recently gained popularity, thanks to the recent implementation of locking plates, which have shown equivalent stability with greater reproducibility, accuracy, and longevity than the closing wedge techniques and a lower prosthetic conversion rate. We present a new \"do-it-yourself\" cutting guides system for tibial opening osteotomy. Using a conventional computed tomography digital image, a positioning guide and wedge spacers were printed in three dimensions (3D) for implementing the osteotomy and obtaining the planned correction. The surgeon makes the whole process in a do-it-yourself style. This new technique was used in eight cases. Previous opening osteotomies with the standard technique were used as control (20 cases). Surgical time, fluoroscopic time, and accuracy of the axial correction were measured. The use of a custom positioning guide reduced the surgical (31 minutes less) and fluoroscopic times (6.9 times less) while achieving a high-axis correction accuracy compared with the standard technique. Digitally planned and executed osteotomies under 3D printed osteotomy positioning guides help the surgeon to minimize human error while reducing surgical time. The reproducibility of this technique is very robust, allowing a transfer of the steps planned in a virtual environment to the operating table.", "journal": "The journal of knee surgery", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["Rub\u00e9nP\u00e9rez-Ma\u00f1anes", "Juan ArnalBurr\u00f3", "Jose RojoManaute", "Francisco ChanaRodriguez", "Javier VaqueroMart\u00edn"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0036-1572412"}

Indomethacin was used as a model drug to prepare drug-loaded poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-based filaments with 3 different drug contents, namely 5%, 15%, and 30%, by hot-melt extrusion. The filaments were further used to 3D print IUS. The results showed that the morphology and drug solid-state properties of the filaments and 3D prototypes were dependent on the amount of drug loading. The drug release profiles from the printed devices were faster than from the corresponding filaments due to a lower degree of the drug crystallinity in IUS in addition to the differences in the external/internal structure and geometry between the products. Diffusion of the drug from the polymer was the predominant mechanism of drug release, whereas poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) biodegradation had a minor effect.

{"title": "Small-Scale Fabrication of Biomimetic Structures for Periodontal Regeneration.", "abstract": "The periodontium is the supporting tissues for the tooth organ and is vulnerable to destruction, arising from overpopulating pathogenic bacteria and spirochaetes. The presence of microbes together with host responses can destroy large parts of the periodontium sometimes leading tooth loss. Permanent tissue replacements are made possible with tissue engineering techniques. However, existing periodontal biomaterials cannot promote proper tissue architectures, necessary tissue volumes within the periodontal pocket and a \"water-tight\" barrier, to become clinically acceptable. New kinds of small-scale engineered biomaterials, with increasing biological complexity are needed to guide proper biomimetic regeneration of periodontal tissues. So the ability to make compound structures with small modules, filled with tissue components, is a promising design strategy for simulating the anatomical complexity of the periodotium attachment complexes along the tooth root and the abutment with the tooth collar. Anatomical structures such as, intima, adventitia, and special compartments such as the epithelial cell rests of Malassez or a stellate reticulum niche need to be engineered from the start of regeneration to produce proper periodontium replacement. It is our contention that the positioning of tissue components at the origin is also necessary to promote self-organizing cell-cell connections, cell-matrix connections. This leads to accelerated, synchronized and well-formed tissue architectures and anatomies. This strategy is a highly effective preparation for tackling periodontitis, periodontium tissue resorption, and to ultimately prevent tooth loss.

Fabrication of such scaffolds from clinically approved materials is currently a huge challenge. The goal of this work was to fabricate a tissue engineering scaffold from clinically approved materials with the capability of delivering biomolecules and direct cell fate. We have used a simple 3D printing approach, that combines polymer casting with supercritical fluid technology to produce 3D interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) scaffold of silicone-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (pHEMA-co-PEGMEA). The pHEMA-co-PEGMEA IPN materials were employed to support growth of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), resulting in high cell viability and metabolic activity over a 3 weeks period. In addition, the IPN scaffolds support 3D tissue formation inside the porous scaffold with well spread cell morphology on the surface of the scaffold. As a proof of concept, sustained doxycycline (DOX) release from pHEMA-co-PEGMEA IPN was demonstrated and the biological activity of released drug from IPN was confirmed using a DOX regulated green fluorescent reporter (GFP) gene expression assay with HeLa cells. Given its unique mechanical and drug releasing characteristics, IPN scaffolds may be used for directing stem cell differentiation by releasing various chemicals from its hydrogel network.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["SoumyaranjanMohanty", "MartinAlm", "MetteHemmingsen", "AlirezaDolatshahi-Pirouz", "JonTrifol", "PeterThomsen", "MartinDufva", "AndersWolff", "JennyEmn\u00e9us"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01722"}

However, mimicking the heterogeneous tissues that most organs and tissues are formed of is challenging. Although multiple-head 3D printing systems have been proposed for fabricating heterogeneous cell-laden hydrogel scaffolds, to date only the simple exterior form has been realized. Here we describe a computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system for this application. We aim to develop an algorithm to enable easy, intuitive design and fabrication of a heterogeneous cell-laden hydrogel scaffolds with a free-form 3D geometry. The printing paths of the scaffold are automatically generated from the 3D CAD model, and the scaffold is then printed by dispensing four materials; i.e., a frame, two kinds of cell-laden hydrogel and a support. We demonstrated printing of heterogeneous tissue models formed of hydrogel scaffolds using this approach, including the outer ear, kidney and tooth tissue.

This study evaluated the use of a preoperatively 3-dimensional (3D)-printed replica of the donor tooth that functions as a surgical guide during autotransplantation.\nFive consecutive procedures were prospectively observed. Transplantations of maxillary premolars with optimal root development were included in this study. A 3D-printed replica of the donor tooth was used to prepare a precisely fitting new alveolus at the recipient site before extracting the donor tooth. Procedure time, extra-alveolar time, and number of attempts needed to achieve a good fit of the donor tooth in the new alveolus were recorded.\nFor each transplantation procedure, the surgical time was shorter than 30\u00a0minutes. An immediate good fit of the donor tooth in the new alveolus was achieved with an extra-alveolar time shorter than 1\u00a0minute for all transplantations.\nThese results show that the extra-alveolar time is very short when the surgical guide is used; therefore, the chance of iatrogenic damage to the donor tooth is minimized.

Previously, a porous hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold with the biocompatibility and osteoconductivity has been developed by this method. However, its osteoinductivity is limited. The main purpose of this study was to improve it by the introduction of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). This scaffold was developed by coating rhBMP-2-delivery microspheres with collagen. These synthesized scaffolds were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), a delivery test in vitro, cell culture, and the experiments in vivo by a Micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) scan and histological evaluation of VanGieson staining. SEM results indicated the surface of scaffolds were more fit for the adhesion of hMSCs to coat collagen/rhBMP-2 microspheres. Biphasic release of rhBMP-2 could continue for more than 21 days, and keep its osteoinductivity to induce osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs in vitro. In addition, the experiments in vivo showed that the scaffold had a good bone regeneration capacity.

{"title": "Solvent-dependent on/off valving using selectively permeable barriers in paper microfluidics.", "abstract": "We report on a new way to control solvent flows in paper microfluidic devices, based on the local patterning of paper with alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) to form barriers with selective permeability for different solvents. Production of the devices is a two-step process. In the first step, AKD-treated paper (hydrophobic) is exposed to oxygen plasma for re-hydrophilization. 3D-printed masks are employed to shield certain areas of this paper to preserve well-defined hydrophobic patterns. In the second step, concentrated AKD in hexane is selectively deposited onto already hydrophobic regions of the paper to locally increase the degree of hydrophobicity. Hydrophilic areas formed in the previous oxygen plasma step are protected from AKD by wetting them with water first to prevent the AKD hexane solution from entering them (hydrophilic exclusion). Characterization of the patterns after both steps shows that reproducible patterns are obtained with linear dependence on the dimensions of the 3D-printed masks. This two-step methodology leads to differential hydrophobicity on the paper: (i) hydrophilic regions, (ii) low-load AKD gates, and (iii) high-load AKD walls. The gates are impermeable to water, yet can be penetrated by most alcohol/water mixtures; the walls cannot. This concept for solvent-dependent on/off valving is demonstrated in two applications. In the first example, a device was developed for multi-step chemical reactions. Different compounds can be spotted separately (closed gates). Upon elution with an alcohol/water mixture, the gates become permeable and the contents are combined. In the second example, volume-defined sampling is introduced. Aqueous sample is allowed to wick into a device and fill a sample chamber. The contents of this sample chamber are eluted perpendicularly with an alcohol/water mixture through a selectively permeable gate.

{"title": "Zebrafish response to 3D printed shoals of conspecifics: the effect of body size.", "abstract": "Recent progress in three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has enabled rapid prototyping of complex models at a limited cost. Virtually every research laboratory has access to a 3D printer, which can assist in the design and implementation of hypothesis-driven studies on animal behavior. In this study, we explore the possibility of using 3D printing technology to understand the role of body size in the social behavior of the zebrafish model organism. In a dichotomous preference test, we study the behavioral response of zebrafish to shoals of 3D printed replicas of varying size. We systematically vary the size of each replica without altering the coloration, aspect ratio, and stripe patterns, which are all selected to closely mimic zebrafish morphophysiology. The replicas are actuated through a robotic manipulator, mimicking the natural motion of live subjects. Zebrafish preference is assessed by scoring the time spent in the vicinity of the shoal of replicas, and the information theoretic construct of transfer entropy is used to further elucidate the influence of the replicas on zebrafish motion.

Considering the long term safe application in human body, the metallic cellular implants are expected to exhibit superior fatigue property. The objective of the study was to study the influence of cell shape on the compressive fatigue behavior of Ti-6Al-4V mesh arrays fabricated by electron beam melting. The results indicated that the underlying fatigue mechanism for the three kinds of meshes (cubic, G7 and rhombic dodecahedron) is the interaction of cyclic ratcheting and fatigue crack growth on the struts, which is closely related to cumulative effect of buckling and bending deformation of the strut. By increasing the buckling deformation on the struts through cell shape design, the cyclic ratcheting rate of the meshes during cyclic deformation was decreased and accordingly, the compressive fatigue strength was increased. With increasing bending deformation of struts, fatigue crack growth in struts contributed more to the fatigue damage of meshes. Rough surface and pores contained in the struts significantly deteriorated the compressive fatigue strength of the struts. By optimizing the buckling and bending deformation through cell shape design, Ti-6Al-4V alloy cellular solids with high fatigue strength and low modulus can be fabricated by the EBM technique.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2016-02-16", "authors": ["SZhao", "S JLi", "W THou", "Y LHao", "RYang", "R D KMisra"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.01.034"}

Bone scaffolds should have appropriate biological as well as mechanical properties in order to play a decisive role in bone healing. Since the fabrication of scaffolds is time consuming and expensive, numerical methods are often utilized to simulate their mechanical properties in order to find a nearly optimum one. Finite element analysis is one of the most common numerical methods that is used in this regard. In this paper, a parametric finite element model is developed to assess the effects of layers penetration\u05f3s effect on inter-layer adhesion, which is reflected on the mechanical properties of bone scaffolds. To be able to validate this model, some compression test specimens as well as bone scaffolds are fabricated with biocompatible and biodegradable poly lactic acid using fused deposition modeling. All these specimens are tested in compression and their elastic modulus is obtained. Using the material parameters of the compression test specimens, the finite element analysis of the bone scaffold is performed. The obtained elastic modulus is compared with experiment indicating a good agreement. Accordingly, the proposed finite element model is able to predict the mechanical behavior of fabricated bone scaffolds accurately. In addition, the effect of post-heating of bone scaffolds on their elastic modulus is investigated.

Three-dimensional visualization (3DV) is a useful tool in anatomy teaching, but current models do not capture haptic qualities. However, three-dimensional printing (3DP) can produce highly accurate complex physical models. Therefore, in this study we aimed to develop a novel 3DP hepatic segment model and compare the teaching effectiveness of a 3DV model, a 3DP model, and a traditional anatomical atlas.\nA healthy candidate (female, 50-years old) was recruited and scanned with computed tomography. After three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, the computed 3D images of the hepatic structures were obtained. The parenchyma model was divided into 8 hepatic segments to produce the 3DV hepatic segment model.

In this work, we prepared a three-dimensional (3D) printed polycaprolactone scaffold (PCLS) grafted with recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP2) attached via polydopamine (DOPA) chemistry. The DOPA coated PCL scaffold was characterized by contact angle, water uptake, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in order to certify that the surface was successfully coated with DOPA. In order to test the loading and release of rhBMP2, we examined the release rate for 28days. For the In vitro cell study, pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded onto PCL scaffolds (PCLSs), DOPA coated PCL scaffold (PCLSD), and scaffolds with varying concentrations of rhBMP2 grafted onto the PCLSD 100 and PCLSD 500 (100 and 500ng/ml loaded), respectively. These scaffolds were evaluated by cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and real time polymerase chain reaction with immunochemistry in order to verify their osteogenic activity. Through these studies, we demonstrated that our fabricated scaffolds were well coated with DOPA as well as grafted with rhBMP2 at a quantity of 22.7\u00b15ng when treatment with 100ng/ml rhBMP2 and 153.3\u00b12.4ng when treated with 500ng/ml rhBMP2. This grafting enables rhBMP2 to be released in a sustained pattern. In the in vitro results, the cell proliferation and an osteoconductivity of PCLSD 500 groups was greater than any other group. All of these results suggest that our manufactured 3D printed porous scaffold would be a useful construct for application to the bone tissue engineering field.\nTissue-engineered scaffolds are not only extremely complex and cumbersome, but also use organic solvents which can negatively influence cellular function. Thus, a rapid, solvent-free method is necessary to improve scaffold generation. Recently, 3D printing such as a rapid prototyping technique has several benefits in that manufacturing is a simple process using computer aided design and scaffolds can be generated without using solvents. In this study, we designed a bio-active scaffold using a very simple and direct method to manufacture DOPA coated 3D PCL porous scaffold grafted with rhBMP2 as a means to create bone-tissue regenerative scaffolds.

{"title": "Fatigue of Ti6Al4V Structural Health Monitoring Systems Produced by Selective Laser Melting.", "abstract": "Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process which is used for producing metallic components. Currently, the integrity of components produced by SLM is in need of improvement due to residual stresses and unknown fracture behavior. Titanium alloys produced by AM are capable candidates for applications in aerospace and industrial fields due to their fracture resistance, fatigue behavior and corrosion resistance. On the other hand, structural health monitoring (SHM) system technologies are promising and requested from the industry. SHM systems can monitor the integrity of a structure and during the last decades the research has primarily been influenced by bionic engineering. In that aspect a new philosophy for SHM has been developed: the so-called effective structural health monitoring (eSHM) system. The current system uses the design freedom provided by AM. The working principle of the system is based on crack detection by means of a network of capillaries that are integrated in a structure. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the functionality of Ti6Al4V produced by the SLM process in the novel SHM system and to confirm that the eSHM system can successfully detect cracks in SLM components. In this study four-point bending fatigue tests on Ti6Al4V SLM specimens with an integrated SHM system were conducted. Fractographic analysis was performed after the final failure, while finite element simulations were used in order to determine the stress distribution in the capillary region and on the component. It was proven that the SHM system does not influence the crack initiation behavior during fatigue. The results highlight the effectiveness of the eSHM on SLM components, which can potentially be used by industrial and aerospace applications.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-02-11", "authors": ["MariaStrantza", "RezaVafadari", "Dieterde Baere", "BeyVrancken", "Wimvan Paepegem", "IsabelleVandendael", "HermanTerryn", "PatrickGuillaume", "Dannyvan Hemelrijck"], "doi": "10.3390/ma9020106\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60206-6\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2003.11.051\n10.1108/13552540510573365\n10.1016/j.actamat.2010.02.004\n10.1007/s11661-011-0731-y\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2014.05.016\n10.1016/j.msea.2011.07.026\n10.1016/j.matdes.2011.07.067\n10.1016/S1471-5317(00)00008-0\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2013.10.022\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1928\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/8/085018\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/5/055020\n10.1177/1475921715604389\n10.1016/j.addma.2014.12.006\n10.1520/STP14974S\n10.1016/S0142-1123(99)00032-8\n10.1016/j.phpro.2014.08.120\n10.1016/j.msea.2015.10.068\n10.1016/j.msec.2013.08.006\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2012.11.011\n10.1016/j.msea.2005.02.019\n10.1007/s11661-014-2549-x\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2009.10.005\n10.1016/S1005-0302(12)60106-6\n10.1007/s11661-002-0160-z\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.08.011"}

Besides traditional 2D computed tomography images, residents in group A (n = 15) reviewed 3D computer models, whereas in group B, residents (n = 15) reviewed 3D-printed models. Both groups subsequently completed an examination, designed in-house, to assess the appropriateness of their preoperative plan and provide a numerical score of the quality of the surgical plan.\nResidents in group B showed significantly higher quality of the surgical plan scores compared with residents in group A (76.4 \u00b1 10.5 vs. 66.5 \u00b1 11.2, p = 0.018).

Major liver functions are tightly linked to the 3D assembly of hepatocytes, with the supporting cell types from both endodermal and mesodermal origins in a hexagonal lobule unit. Although there are many reports on functional 2D cell differentiation, few studies have demonstrated the in vitro maturation of hiPSC-derived hepatic progenitor cells (hiPSC-HPCs) in a 3D environment that depicts the physiologically relevant cell combination and microarchitecture. The application of rapid, digital 3D bioprinting to tissue engineering has allowed 3D patterning of multiple cell types in a predefined biomimetic manner. Here we present a 3D hydrogel-based triculture model that embeds hiPSC-HPCs with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and adipose-derived stem cells in a microscale hexagonal architecture. In comparison with 2D monolayer culture and a 3D HPC-only model, our 3D triculture model shows both phenotypic and functional enhancements in the hiPSC-HPCs over weeks of in vitro culture. Specifically, we find improved morphological organization, higher liver-specific gene expression levels, increased metabolic product secretion, and enhanced cytochrome P450 induction.

First, it allowed clarification of the diagnostic assessment of CHD, by offering a better understanding of normal cardiac physiology and the pathophysiology and anatomy of complex malformations.

Nowadays, techniques have evolved and cardiac catheterization is widely used to percutaneously close intracardiac shunts, to relieve obstructive valvar or vessel lesions, and for transcatheter valve replacement. Accurate imaging is mandatory to guide these procedures. Cardiac imaging during catheterization of CHD must provide accurate images of lesions, surrounding cardiac structures, medical devices and tools used to deliver them. Cardiac imaging has to be 'real-time' with an excellent temporal resolution to ensure 'eyes-hands' synchronization and 'device-target area' accurate positioning.

Physicochemical characterization of the formed scaffolds was carried out for phase analysis, surface morphology, and mechanical properties. A similar scaffold was prepared using a chemically synthesized calcium phosphate powder that was compared with the natural origin one. The higher surface area associated with the interconnected porosity along with multiple phases of the natural origin scaffold facilitated higher cell adhesion and proliferation compared to the chemically synthesized one. Further, the natural origin scaffold displayed relatively higher cell differentiation activity, as is evident by protein and gene expression studies.

{"title": "Increasing the strength and bioactivity of collagen scaffolds using customizable arrays of 3D-printed polymer fibers.", "abstract": "Tendon is a highly aligned connective tissue which transmits force from muscle to bone. Each year, people in the US sustain more than 32 million tendon injuries. To mitigate poor functional outcomes due to scar formation, current surgical techniques rely heavily on autografts. Biomaterial platforms and tissue engineering methods offer an alternative approach to address these injuries. Scaffolds incorporating aligned structural features can promote expansion of adult tenocytes and mesenchymal stem cells capable of tenogenic differentiation. However, appropriate balance between scaffold bioactivity and mechanical strength of these constructs remains challenging. The high porosity required to facilitate cell infiltration, nutrient and oxygen biotransport within three-dimensional constructs typically results in insufficient biomechanical strength. Here we describe the use of three-dimensional printing techniques to create customizable arrays of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) fibers that can be incorporated into a collagen scaffold under development for tendon repair. Notably, mechanical performance of scaffold-fiber composites (elastic modulus, peak stress, strain at peak stress, and toughness) can be selectively manipulated by varying fiber-reinforcement geometry without affecting the native bioactivity of the collagen scaffold. Further, we report an approach to functionalize ABS fibers with activity-inducing growth factors via sequential oxygen plasma and carbodiimide crosslinking treatments. Together, we report an adaptable approach to control both mechanical strength and presence of biomolecular cues in a manner orthogonal to the architecture of the collagen scaffold itself.\nTendon injuries account for more than 32 million injuries each year in the US alone. Current techniques use allografts to mitigate poor functional outcomes, but are not ideal platforms to induce functional regeneration following injury. Tissue engineering approaches using biomaterial substrates have significant potential for addressing these defects. However, the high porosity required to facilitate cell infiltration and nutrient transport often dictates that the resultant biomaterials has insufficient biomechanical strength. Here we describe the use of three-dimensional printing techniques to generate customizable fiber arrays from ABS polymer that can be incorporated into a collagen scaffold under development for tendon repair applications.

Transfer of subcellular organelles through TNTs was observed in vitro and in vivo, but the formation and significance of these structures is not well understood. A polydimethylsiloxane biochip-based coculture model was devised to constrain TNT orientation and explore both TNT-formation and TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer. Two parallel microfluidic channels connected by an array of smaller microchannels enabled localization of stem cell and cardiomyocyte populations while allowing connections to form between them. Stem cells and cardiomyocytes were deposited in their respective microfluidic channels, and stem cell-cardiomyocyte pairs were formed via the microchannels. Formation of TNTs and transfer of stained mitochondria through TNTs was observed by 24 h real-time video recording. The data show that stem cells are 7.7 times more likely to initiate contact by initial extension of filopodia. By 24 h, 67% of nanotube connections through the microchannels are composed of cardiomyocyte membrane. Filopodial extension and retraction by stem cells draws an extension of TNTs from cardiomyocytes. MitoTracker staining shows that unidirectional transfer of mitochondria between stem cell-cardiomyocyte pairs invariably originates from stem cells. Control experiments with cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes show little nanotube formation between homotypic or mixed cell pairs and no mitochondrial transfer. These data identify a novel biological process, unidirectional mitochondrial transfer, mediated by heterotypic TNT connections. This suggests that the enhancement of cardiomyocyte function seen after stem-cell injection may be due to a bioenergetic stimulus provided by mitochondrial transfer.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-02-06", "authors": ["HuaxiaoYang", "Thomas KBorg", "ZhenMa", "MeifengXu", "GeorgeWetzel", "Laxmikant VSaraf", "RogerMarkwald", "Raymond BRunyan", "Bruce ZGao"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015012"}
{"title": "Investigation of thermal degradation with extrusion-based dispensing modules for 3D bioprinting technology.", "abstract": "Recently, numerous three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting systems have been introduced for the artificial regeneration of tissues. Among them, the extrusion-based dispensing module is the most widely used because of the processability it gives various biomaterials. The module uses high forces and temperature to dispense materials through a micro-nozzle. Generally, the harsh conditions induce thermal degradation of the material in the dispensing procedure. The thermal degradation affects the properties of the materials, and the change of the properties should be carefully controlled, because it severely affects the regeneration of tissues. Therefore, in this research, the relationship between the dispensing module and the thermal degradation of material was investigated. Extrusion-based dispensing modules can be divided into the syringe type (ST) and filament type (FT) based on working principles. We prepared a poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffold with the two methods at various time points. Then, the characteristics of the printed scaffolds were assessed by measuring molecular weight (M w), glass transition temperature (T g), in vitro degradation, compressive modulus, and cytocompatibility. The results showed that the PLGA scaffold with the FT dispensing module maintained its properties regardless of printing time points. In contrast, severe thermal degradation was observed in the scaffold group prepared by the ST dispensing module. Consequentially, it was obvious that the FT dispensing module was more suitable for producing scaffolds without severe thermal degradation.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-02-06", "authors": ["HyungseokLee", "James JYoo", "Hyun-WookKang", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015011"}

Oils, fats, and Vaseline were investigated as surrogates for adipose tissue and bone marrow. Anthropomorphic shapes of bone and organs were realized using 3D-printing techniques based on segmentations of patient CT-scans. All materials were characterized in dual energy CT and MRI to adapt CT numbers, electron density, effective atomic number, as well as T1- and T2-relaxation times to patient and literature values.\nSoft tissue simulation could be achieved with agarose gels in combination with a gadolinium-based contrast agent and NaF to simulate muscle, prostate, and tumor tissues. Vegetable oils were shown to be a good representation for adipose tissue in all modalities. Inner bone was realized using a mixture of Vaseline and K2HPO4, resulting in both a fatty bone marrow signal in MRI and inhomogeneous areas of low and high attenuation in CT. The high attenuation of outer bone was additionally adapted by applying gypsum bandages to the 3D-printed hollow bone case with values up to 1200 HU. Deformable hollow organs were manufactured using silicone. Signal loss in the MR images based on the conductivity of the gels needs to be further investigated.\nThe presented surrogates and techniques allow the customized construction of multimodality, anthropomorphic, and deformable phantoms as exemplarily shown for a pelvic phantom, which is intended to study adaptive treatment scenarios in MR-guided radiation therapy.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2016-02-05", "authors": ["Nina INiebuhr", "WibkeJohnen", "TimurG\u00fcldaglar", "ArminRunz", "GernotEchner", "PhilippMann", "ChristianM\u00f6hler", "AsjaPfaffenberger", "OliverJ\u00e4kel", "SteffenGreilich"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4939874"}
{"title": "Fabrication and characterization of gels with integrated channels using 3D printing with microfluidic nozzle for tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "The lack of a simple and effective method to integrate vascular network with engineered scaffolds and tissue constructs remains one of the biggest challenges in true 3D tissue engineering. Here, we detail the use of a commercially available, low-cost, open-source 3D printer modified with a microfluidic print-head in order to develop a method for the generation of instantly perfusable vascular network integrated with gel scaffolds seeded with cells. The print-head features an integrated coaxial nozzle that allows the fabrication of hollow, calcium-polymerized alginate tubes that can be easily patterned using 3D printing techniques. The diameter of the hollow channel can be precisely controlled and varied between 500\u00a0\u03bcm - 2\u00a0mm by changing applied flow rates or print-head speed. These channels are integrated into gel layers with a thickness of 800\u00a0\u03bcm - 2.5\u00a0mm. The structural rigidity of these constructs allows the fabrication of multi-layered structures without causing the collapse of hollow channels in lower layers. The 3D printing method was fully characterized at a range of operating speeds (0-40\u00a0m/min) and corresponding flow rates (1-30\u00a0mL/min) were identified to produce precise definition. This microfluidic design also allows the incorporation of a wide range of scaffold materials as well as biological constituents such as cells, growth factors, and ECM material. Media perfusion of the channels causes a significant viability increase in the bulk of cell-laden structures over the long-term.

{"title": "Open-Source Selective Laser Sintering (OpenSLS) of Nylon and Biocompatible Polycaprolactone.", "abstract": "Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing process that uses a laser to fuse powdered starting materials into solid 3D structures. Despite the potential for fabrication of complex, high-resolution structures with SLS using diverse starting materials (including biomaterials), prohibitive costs of commercial SLS systems have hindered the wide adoption of this technology in the scientific community. Here, we developed a low-cost, open-source SLS system (OpenSLS) and demonstrated its capacity to fabricate structures in nylon with sub-millimeter features and overhanging regions. Subsequently, we demonstrated fabrication of polycaprolactone (PCL) into macroporous structures such as a diamond lattice. Widespread interest in using PCL for bone tissue engineering suggests that PCL lattices are relevant model scaffold geometries for engineering bone. SLS of materials with large powder grain size (~500 \u03bcm) leads to part surfaces with high roughness, so we further introduced a simple vapor-smoothing technique to reduce the surface roughness of sintered PCL structures which further improves their elastic modulus and yield stress. Vapor-smoothed PCL can also be used for sacrificial templating of perfusable fluidic networks within orthogonal materials such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) silicone. Finally, we demonstrated that human mesenchymal stem cells were able to adhere, survive, and differentiate down an osteogenic lineage on sintered and smoothed PCL surfaces, suggesting that OpenSLS has the potential to produce PCL scaffolds useful for cell studies.

{"title": "The influence of sterilization on nitrogen-included ultrananocrystalline diamond for biomedical applications.", "abstract": "Diamond has shown great potential in different biomedical applications, but the effects of sterilization on its properties have not been investigated. Here, we studied the influence of five sterilization techniques (solvent cleaning, oxygen plasma, UV irradiation, autoclave and hydrogen peroxide) on nitrogen-included ultrananocrystalline diamond. The chemical modification of the diamond surface was evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurements. Different degrees of surface oxidation and selective sp(2) bonded carbon etching were found following all sterilization techniques, resulting in an increase of hydrophilicity. Higher viabilities of in vitro mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and rat cortical neuron cells were observed on oxygen plasma, autoclave and hydrogen peroxide sterilized diamond, which correlated with their higher hydrophilicity. By examination of apatite formation in simulated body fluid, in vivo bioactivity was predicted to be best on those surfaces which have been oxygen plasma treated and lowest on those which have been exposed to UV irradiation. The charge injection properties were also altered by the sterilization process and there appears to be a correlation between these changes and the degree of oxygen termination of the surface. We find that the modification brought by autoclave, oxygen plasma and hydrogen peroxide were most consistent with the use of N-UNCD in biological applications as compared to samples sterilized by solvent cleaning or UV exposure or indeed non-sterilized. A two-step process of sterilization by hydrogen peroxide following oxygen plasma treatment was then suggested. However, the final choice of sterilization technique will depend on the intended end application.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Digital micromirror device (DMD)-based 3D printing of poly(propylene fumarate) scaffolds.", "abstract": "Our recent investigations into the 3D printing of poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF), a linear polyester, using a DMD-based system brought us to a resin that used titanium dioxide (TiO2) as an ultraviolet (UV) filter for controlling cure depth. However, this material hindered the 3D printing process due to undesirable lateral or \"dark\" curing (i.e., in areas not exposed to light from the DMD chip). Well known from its use in sunscreen, another UV filter, oxybenzone, has previously been used in conjunction with TiO2. In this study we hypothesize that combining these two UV filters will result in a synergistic effect that controls cure depth and avoids dark cure. A resin mixture (i.e., polymer, initiator, UV filters) was identified that worked well. The resin was then further characterized through mechanical testing, cure testing, and cytotoxicity testing to investigate its use as a material for bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Results show that the final resin eliminated dark cure as shown through image analysis. Mechanically the new scaffolds proved to be far weaker than those printed from previous resins, with compressive strengths of 7.8 \u00b1 0.5 MPa vs. 36.5 \u00b1 1.6 MPa, respectively. The new scaffolds showed a 90% reduction in elastic modulus and a 74% increase in max strain. These properties may be useful in tissue engineering applications where resorption is required. Initial cytotoxicity evaluation was negative. As hypothesized, the use of TiO2 and oxybenzone showed synergistic effects in the 3D printing of PPF tissue engineering scaffolds.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Fabrication of scalable tissue engineering scaffolds with dual-pore microarchitecture by combining 3D printing and particle leaching.", "abstract": "Limitations in controlling scaffold architecture using traditional fabrication techniques are a problem when constructing engineered tissues/organs. Recently, integration of two pore architectures to generate dual-pore scaffolds with tailored physical properties has attracted wide attention in tissue engineering community. Such scaffolds features primary structured pores which can efficiently enhance nutrient/oxygen supply to the surrounding, in combination with secondary random pores, which give high surface area for cell adhesion and proliferation. Here, we present a new technique to fabricate dual-pore scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications where 3D printing of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) mould is combined with salt leaching process. In this technique the sacrificial PVA mould, determining the structured pore architecture, was filled with salt crystals to define the random pore regions of the scaffold. After crosslinking the casted polymer the combined PVA-salt mould was dissolved in water. The technique has advantages over previously reported ones, such as automated assembly of the sacrificial mould, and precise control over pore architecture/dimensions by 3D printing parameters. In this study, polydimethylsiloxane and biodegradable poly(\u03f5-caprolactone) were used for fabrication. However, we show that this technique is also suitable for other biocompatible/biodegradable polymers. Various physical and mechanical properties of the dual-pore scaffolds were compared with control scaffolds with either only structured or only random pores, fabricated using previously reported methods. The fabricated dual-pore scaffolds supported high cell density, due to the random pores, in combination with uniform cell distribution throughout the scaffold, and higher cell proliferation and viability due to efficient nutrient/oxygen transport through the structured pores. In conclusion, the described fabrication technique is rapid, inexpensive, scalable, and compatible with different polymers, making it suitable for engineering various large scale organs/tissues.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

However, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were not widely used due to its poor performance.\nInspired from the eigenface approach for face recognition problems, we proposed an eigenbrain to detect AD brains. Eigenface is only for 2D image processing and is not suitable for volumetric image processing since faces are usually obtained as 2D images.\nWe extended the eigenbrain to 3D. This 3D eigenbrain (3D-EB) inherits the fundamental strategies in either eigenface or 2D eigenbrain (2D-EB).

With the advancement of material science, it becomes a possible strategy to generate active biophysical signals for directing stem cell fate through specially designed material microstructures. In the past five years, significant progress has been made in this field, and these designed biophysical signals include material elasticity/rigidity, micropatterned structure, extracellular matrix (ECM) coated materials, material transmitted extracellular mechanical force etc. A large number of investigations involved material directed differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, neural stem/progenitor cells, adipose derived stem cells, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells and other cells. Hydrogel based materials were commonly used to create varied mechanical properties via modifying the ratio of different components, crosslinking levels, matrix concentration and conjugation with other components.

The main advantages reported were the possibilities for preoperative planning (n\u00a0=\u00a077, 48.7%), the accuracy of the process used (n\u00a0=\u00a053, 33.5%), and the time saved in the operating room (n\u00a0=\u00a052, 32.9%); 34 studies (21.5%) stressed that the accuracy was not satisfactory. The time needed to prepare the object (n\u00a0=\u00a031, 19.6%) and the additional costs (n\u00a0=\u00a030, 19.0%) were also seen as important limitations for routine use of 3D printing.\nThe additional cost and the time needed to produce devices by current 3D technology still limit its widespread use in hospitals. The development of guidelines to improve the reporting of experience with 3D printing in surgery is highly desirable.", "journal": "Surgery", "date": "2016-02-03", "authors": ["NicolasMartelli", "CaroleSerrano", "H\u00e9l\u00e8nevan den Brink", "JudithPineau", "PatricePrognon", "IsabelleBorget", "SalmaEl Batti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.surg.2015.12.017"}
{"title": "A Wireless EEG Recording Method for Rat Use inside the Water Maze.", "abstract": "With the continued miniaturisation of portable embedded systems, wireless EEG recording techniques are becoming increasingly prevalent in animal behavioural research. However, in spite of their versatility and portability, they have seldom been used inside water-maze tasks designed for rats. As such, a novel 3D printed implant and waterproof connector is presented, which can facilitate wireless water-maze EEG recordings in freely-moving rats, using a commercial wireless recording system (W32; Multichannel Systems). As well as waterproofing the wireless system, battery, and electrode connector, the implant serves to reduce movement-related artefacts by redistributing movement-related forces away from the electrode connector. This implant/connector was able to successfully record high-quality LFP in the hippocampo-striatal brain regions of rats as they undertook a procedural-learning variant of the double-H water-maze task. Notably, there were no significant performance deficits through its use when compared with a control group across a number of metrics including number of errors and speed of task completion. Taken together, this method can expand the range of measurements that are currently possible in this diverse area of behavioural neuroscience, whilst paving the way for integration with more complex behaviours.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-02-02", "authors": ["Richard CPinnell", "Rand KAlmajidy", "Robert DKirch", "Jean CCassel", "Ulrich GHofmann"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0147730\n10.1046/j.0953-816x.2001.01487.x\n10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00784-5\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.06.014\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.02.007\n10.1016/j.bbr.2010.11.043\n10.1016/j.bbr.2012.02.021\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2011.07.018\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.09.029\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0030402\n10.1016/j.neuron.2010.05.013\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4122-11.2012\n10.1073/pnas.0810524105\n10.3389/fneng.2013.00006\n10.3791/52667\n10.1038/nature13162\n10.1038/nature13162"}
{"title": "Personalized development of human organs using 3D printing technology.", "abstract": "3D printing is a technique of fabricating physical models from a 3D volumetric digital image. The image is sliced and printed using a specific material into thin layers, and successive layering of the material produces a 3D model. It has already been used for printing surgical models for preoperative planning and in constructing personalized prostheses for patients. The ultimate goal is to achieve the development of functional human organs and tissues, to overcome limitations of organ transplantation created by the lack of organ donors and life-long immunosuppression. We hypothesized a precision medicine approach to human organ fabrication using 3D printed technology, in which the digital volumetric data would be collected by imaging of a patient, i.e. CT or MRI images followed by mathematical modeling to create a digital 3D image. Then a suitable biocompatible material, with an optimal resolution for cells seeding and maintenance of cell viability during the printing process, would be printed with a compatible printer type and finally implanted into the patient. Life-saving operations with 3D printed implants were already performed in patients. However, several issues need to be addressed before translational application of 3D printing into clinical medicine. These are vascularization, innervation, and financial cost of 3D printing and safety of biomaterials used for the construct.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2016-01-31", "authors": ["DinaRadenkovic", "AtefehSolouk", "AlexanderSeifalian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2015.12.017"}

This manuscript reviews the current and potential applications for three-dimensional printing, including education, presurgical planning, surgical simulation, bioprinting, and printed surgical equipment.\nThree-dimensional printing has proved most relevant in the fields of craniofacial, plastic, orthopedics, and especially, urologic surgery. This review focuses on several examples of how three-dimensional printing can be utilized, with emphasis on renal models for renal cell carcinoma, ureteral stents, and staghorn calculus. From an education standpoint, both patients and residents can benefit from the use of three-dimensional printed models, and even skilled surgeons report better understanding of complex procedures by using printed models.\nThree-dimensional printing in the field of medicine is growing quickly, and will soon be incorporated into the way residents are taught and patients are educated.

This low-cost system enabled a team to simultaneously view the laryngoscopy process on the smartphone screen, and also enabled image transmission. We compared the Airtraq(\u00ae) with the smartphone Airtraq(\u00ae) system in a crossover study of trainee anesthesiologists performing tracheal intubation in a manikin. We also evaluated the smartphone Airtraq(\u00ae) system for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in 30 patients, including image transmission to and communication with a remote instructor. In the manikin study, the smartphone Airtraq(\u00ae) system enabled instruction where both trainee and instructor could view the larynx simultaneously, and did not substantially increase the time required for intubation. In the patient study, we were able to view the larynx in all 30 patients, and the remote instructor was able to receive the images and to respond on correctness of laryngoscopy and tracheal tube placement. Tracheal intubation was successful within 90s in 19 (63\u00a0%) patients.

In this work, we aim to engineer dermal tissue micromodules obtained by culturing human dermal fibroblasts into porous gelatine microscaffold. We proved that such stromal cells coupled with gelatine microscaffolds are able to synthesize and to assemble an endogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) resulting in tissue micromodules, which evolve their biophysical features over the time. In particular, we found a time-dependent variation of oxygen consumption kinetic parameters, of newly formed ECM stiffness and of micromodules self-aggregation properties. As consequence when used as building blocks to fabricate larger tissues, the initial tissue micromodules state strongly affects the ECM organization and maturation in the final macrotissue. Such results highlight the role of the micromodules properties in controlling the formation of three-dimensional macrotissue in vitro, defining an innovative design criterion for selecting tissue-building blocks for modular tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-01-30", "authors": ["FUrciuolo", "AGarziano", "GImparato", "VPanzetta", "SFusco", "CCasale", "P ANetti"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015010"}

The scaffold presented a gradient of physical and mechanical properties which elicited different biological responses from human mesenchymal stem cells. Biological test were performed on the whole TPS and on scaffolds comprised of each single part of the TPS, considered as the controls. The TPS showed an increase of the metabolic activity with culturing time that seemed to be an average of the controls at each time point. The importance of differentiation media for bone and ligament regeneration was further investigated. Metabolic activity analysis on the different areas of the TPS showed a similar trend after 7 days in both differentiation media. Total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity analysis showed a statistically higher activity of the TPS in mineralization medium compared to the controls. A different glycosaminoglycans amount between the TPS and its controls was detected, displaying a similar trend with respect to ALP activity.

{"title": "Investigation of the hydrodynamic response of cells in drop on demand piezoelectric inkjet nozzles.", "abstract": "Cell motion within a liquid suspension inside a piezoelectrically actuated, cylindrical inkjet printhead was studied using high speed imaging and a low depth of field setup. For each ejected droplet, a cell within the inkjet nozzle was observed to exhibit one of three possible behaviors which are termed: cell travel, cell ejection and cell reflection. Cell reflection is an undesirable phenomenon which may adversely affect an inkjet's capability in dispensing cells and a possible reason why it was previously reported that the rate of cells dispensed did not follow the expected Poisson distribution. Through the study of the cells motions, it was hypothesized that the rheological properties of the media in the cell suspension play an important role in influencing the cell behaviors exhibited. This was experimentally studied with the tracking of cells within the inkjet nozzle in a 10% w/v Ficoll PM400 cell suspension. The effect of cell reflection was eliminated using the higher density and viscosity Ficoll PM400 suspension. The presented work is the first in-depth study of the cell behaviors occurring within a piezoelectric inkjet nozzle during the printing process. The understanding of the hydrodynamics during a droplet ejection and its effect on the suspended cells are imperative towards achieving reliable cell dispensing for biofabrication applications.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-01-30", "authors": ["EricCheng", "HaoranYu", "AliAhmadi", "Karen CCheung"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015008"}
{"title": "Surgical results of cranioplasty with a polymethylmethacrylate customized cranial implant in pediatric patients: a single-center experience.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Cranioplasty is a reconstructive procedure used to restore skull anatomy and repair skull defects. Optimal skull reconstruction is a challenge for neurosurgeons, and the strategy used to achieve the best result remains a topic of debate, especially in pediatric patients for whom the continuing skull growth makes the choice of material more difficult. When the native bone flap, which is universally accepted as the preferred option in pediatric patients, is unavailable, the authors' choice of prosthetic material is a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implant designed using a custom-made technique. In this paper the authors present the results of their clinical series of 12 custom-made PMMA implants in pediatric patients. METHODS A retrospective study of the patients who had undergone cranioplasty at Gaslini Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2013 was conducted. A total of 12 consecutive cranioplasties in 12 patients was reviewed, in which a patient-specific PMMA implant was manufactured using a virtual 3D model and then transformed into a physical model using selective laser sintering or 3D printing. All patients or parents were administered a questionnaire to assess how the patient/parent judged the aesthetic result. RESULTS Patient age at craniectomy ranged from 5 months to 12.5 years, with a mean age of 84.33 months at cranioplasty. The mean extension of the custom-made plastic was 56.83 cm(2). The mean time between craniectomy and cranioplasty was 9.25 months. The mean follow-up duration was 55.7 months. No major complications were recorded; 3 patients experienced minor/moderate complications (prosthesis dislocation, granuloma formation, and fluid collection). CONCLUSIONS In this patient series, PMMA resulted in an extremely low complication rate and the custom-made technique was associated with an excellent grade of patient or parent satisfaction on long-term follow up.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

{"title": "3D In Vitro Model for Breast Cancer Research Using Magnetic Levitation and Bioprinting Method.", "abstract": "Tumor microenvironment composition and architecture are known as a major factor in orchestrating the tumor growth and its response to various therapies. In this context, in vivo studies are necessary to evaluate the responses. However, while tumor cells can be of human origin, tumor microenvironment in the in vivo models is host-based. On the other hand, in vitro studies in a flat monoculture of tumor cells (the most frequently used in vitro tumor model) are unable to recapitulate the complexity of tumor microenvironment. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cell cultures of tumor cells have been proven to be an important experimental tool in understanding mechanisms of tumor growth, response to therapeutics, and transport of nutrients/drugs. We have recently described a novel tool to create 3D co-cultures of tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our method utilizes magnetic manipulation/levitation of the specific ratios of tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment (from human or animal origin) aiding in the formation of tumor spheres with defined cellular composition and density, as quickly as within 24 h.

The objective of this preclinical study is to develop poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds with mesoscale and microscale architectural cues specific to human ligament progenitor cells and assess their ability to form aligned bone-ligament-cementum complexes in vivo. PCL scaffolds are designed to integrate a 3D printed bone region with a micropatterned PCL thin film consisting of grooved pillars. The patterned film region is seeded with human ligament cells, fibroblasts transduced with bone morphogenetic protein-7 genes seeded within the bone region, and a tooth dentin segment positioned on the ligament region prior to subcutaneous implantation into a murine model. Results indicate increased tissue alignment in vivo using micropatterned PCL films, compared to random-porous PCL. At week 6, 30 \u03bcm groove depth significantly enhances oriented collagen fiber thickness, overall cell alignment, and nuclear elongation relative to 10 \u03bcm groove depth.

While keeping the elastic modulus constant, the stiffness of the micropillars was controlled by varying their height. Subsequently, the single cell traction forces of rabbit chondrocytes, human dermal fibroblasts, human mesenchymal stem cells, and bovine nucleus pulposus cells (bNPCs) were successfully measured by culturing the cells on micropillar arrays of different stiffness.

Here, we demonstrate that hydrogels of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) can be processed into complex shapes, and used as a sacrificial template to prepare freestanding cell constructs. We showcase our approach for the fabrication of hollow fibers using a controlled extrusion through a circular die into a coagulation bath. The dimensions of the hollow fibers are tunable, and the final tubes combine the nanofibrillar porosity of the CNF hydrogel with a submillimeter wall thickness and centimeter-scale length provided by the additive manufacturing technique. We demonstrate that covalent and supramolecular cross-linking of the CNFs can be used to tailor the mechanical properties of the hydrogel tubes within 1 order of magnitude and in an attractive range for the mechanosensation of cells. The resulting tubes are highly biocompatible and allow for the growth of mouse fibroblasts into confluent cell layers in their inner lumen. A detailed screening of several cellulases enables degradation of the scaffolding, temporary CNF hydrogel tube in a quick and highly cell-friendly way, and allows the isolation of coherent cell tubes. We foresee that the growing capabilities of hydrogel printing techniques in combination with the attractive features of CNFs-sustainable, globally abundant, biocompatible and enzymatically degradable-will allow making plant-based biomaterials with hierarchical structures and on-demand degradation useful, for instance, to engineer complex tissue structures to replace animal models, and for implants.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2016-01-27", "authors": ["Jose GuillermoTorres-Rendon", "MariusK\u00f6pf", "DavidGehlen", "AndreasBlaeser", "HorstFischer", "LauraDe Laporte", "AndreasWalther"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01593"}

Computational methods foster tissue engineering by pointing out dominant mechanisms involved in shaping multicellular systems.

This process is of interest in bioprinting, in which multicellular spheroids or cylinders are embedded in a supportive hydrogel by a computer-controlled device. We simulated post-printing rearrangements of cells, aiming to predict the shape and stability of certain printed structures. To this end, we developed a two-dimensional LB model of a multicellular system in a hydrogel. Our parallel computing code was implemented using the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc). To validate the LB model, we simulated the fusion of multicellular cylinders in a contiguous, hexagonal arrangement. Our two-dimensional LB simulation describes the evolution of the transversal cross section of the construct built from three-dimensional multicellular cylinders whose length is much larger than their diameter. Fusion eventually gave rise to a tubular construct, in qualitative agreement with bioprinting experiments. Then we simulated the time course of a defect in a bioprinted tube. To address practical problems encountered in tissue engineering, we also simulated the evolution of a planar construct, as well as of a bulky, perfusable construct made of multicellular cylinders.

The approach enabled to produce a porous scaffold with tailored physical, mechanical, and biological properties because of the flexibility to tune the scaffold architecture. The objective of the study described was to elucidate the determining role of cell-laid extracellular matrix (ECM) in impacting biological response. In this regard, to mimic the natural ECM environment or the attributes of the native tissue, a natural ECM analogue surface was produced on the 3D printed and sintered hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold surface by the mineralized ECM of the osteoblast. This involved the growth of osteoblast on 3D printed scaffolds, followed by differentiation to deposit the mineralized ECM on the biomaterial surface. The cells were removed from the mineralized matrix using freeze-thaw cycles to obtain a decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) on the biomaterial surface. Subsequently, seeding of osteoblast on dECM-ornamented HA scaffolds led to 3D growth with enhanced expression of prominent proteins, actin and vinculin. Based on preliminary observations of present study, it was underscored that HA scaffolds-ornamented with dECM provided an optimized microenvironment conducive to the growth of 3D structural tissue and favorably promoted biological functionality because of the availability of an environment that promoted cell-cell and cell-scaffold interaction. The primary advantage of dECM is that it enabled constructive remodeling and promoted the formation of tissue in lieu of less functional tissue.

Multiple colors and compositions of semiconductor quantum dot (QD) were evaluated as photoluminescent materials for all-in-one smartphone excitation and imaging of PL, and these were compared with fluorescein and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), which are widely utilized molecular and protein materials for fluorescence-based bioanalysis. The QDs were found to exhibit much better brightness and have the best potential for two-color detection. A model protein binding assay with a sub-microgram per milliliter detection limit and a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for proteolytic activity were demonstrated, including imaging with serum as a sample matrix. In addition, FRET within tandem conjugates of a QD donor and fluorescent dye acceptor enabled smartphone detection of dye fluorescence that was otherwise unobservable without the QD to enhance its brightness. The ideal properties of photoluminescent materials for all-in-one smartphone excitation and imaging are discussed in the context of several different materials, where QDs appear to be the best overall material for this application.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["EleonoraPetryayeva", "W RussAlgar"], "doi": "10.1007/s00216-015-9300-3"}

{"title": "Supercapacitors Based on Three-Dimensional Hierarchical Graphene Aerogels with Periodic Macropores.", "abstract": "Graphene is an atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) carbon material that offers a unique combination of low density, exceptional mechanical properties, thermal stability, large surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity. Recent progress has resulted in macro-assemblies of graphene, such as bulk graphene aerogels for a variety of applications. However, these three-dimensional (3D) graphenes exhibit physicochemical property attenuation compared to their 2D building blocks because of one-fold composition and tortuous, stochastic porous networks. These limitations can be offset by developing a graphene composite material with an engineered porous architecture. Here, we report the fabrication of 3D periodic graphene composite aerogel microlattices for supercapacitor applications, via a 3D printing technique known as direct-ink writing. The key factor in developing these novel aerogels is creating an extrudable graphene oxide-based composite ink and modifying the 3D printing method to accommodate aerogel processing. The 3D-printed graphene composite aerogel (3D-GCA) electrodes are lightweight, highly conductive, and exhibit excellent electrochemical properties. In particular, the supercapacitors using these 3D-GCA electrodes with thicknesses on the order of millimeters display exceptional capacitive retention (ca. 90% from 0.5 to 10 A\u00b7g(-1)) and power densities (>4 kW\u00b7kg(-1)) that equal or exceed those of reported devices made with electrodes 10-100 times thinner.

Preoperatively, a cobalt-chrome 3D-printed dental splint was prepared. Surgical correction of the malocclusion was carried out by segmental osteotomies of the mandible at the original fracture sites. This involved a vertical paramedian osteotomy on the right side and a unilateral sagittal split osteotomy on the left mandibular angle side.

Cellular solids, in fact, due their superior mechanical performances to a unique arrangement of the bulk material properties (i.e. anisotropy and heterogeneity) and cell structural features (i.e. pores shape, size and distribution) at the micro- and nano-scales.

The objective of this study was to propose a strategy for developing, characterizing, and testing of feed spacers by numerical modeling, three-dimensional (3D) printing of feed spacers and experimental membrane fouling simulator (MFS) studies. The results of numerical modeling on the hydrodynamic behavior of various feed spacer geometries suggested that the impact of spacers on hydrodynamics and biofouling can be improved. A good agreement was found for the modeled and measured relationship between linear flow velocity and pressure drop for feed spacers with the same geometry, indicating that modeling can serve as the first step in spacer characterization. An experimental comparison study of a feed spacer currently applied in practice and a 3D printed feed spacer with the same geometry showed (i) similar hydrodynamic behavior, (ii) similar pressure drop development with time and (iii) similar biomass accumulation during MFS biofouling studies, indicating that 3D printing technology is an alternative strategy for development of thin feed spacers with a complex geometry. Based on the numerical modeling results, a modified feed spacer with low pressure drop was selected for 3D printing. The comparison study of the feed spacer from practice and the modified geometry 3D printed feed spacer established that the 3D printed spacer had (i) a lower pressure drop during hydrodynamic testing, (ii) a lower pressure drop increase in time with the same accumulated biomass amount, indicating that modifying feed spacer geometries can reduce the impact of accumulated biomass on membrane performance. The combination of numerical modeling of feed spacers and experimental testing of 3D printed feed spacers is a promising strategy (rapid, low cost and representative) to develop advanced feed spacers aiming to reduce the impact of biofilm formation on membrane performance and to improve the cleanability of spiral-wound NF and RO membrane systems.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have great clinical potential as they are an adult stem cell population capable of multilineage differentiation. The relationship between MSC behavior and several material properties including substrate stiffness and pore size are well investigated, but there has been little research on the influence of porous architecture in a three-dimensional scaffold with a well-controlled architecture. Here, we investigate the impact of two different three-dimensionally printed, pore geometries on the enrichment and differentiation of MSCs. 3D printed scaffolds with ordered cubic pore geometry were supportive of MSC enrichment from unprocessed bone marrow, resulting in cell surface marker expression that was comparable to typical adhesion to tissue culture polystyrene, the gold standard for MSC culture. Results also show that scaffolds fabricated with ordered cubic pores significantly increase the gene expression of MSCs undergoing adipogenesis and chondrogenesis, when compared to scaffolds with ordered cylindrical pores. However, at the protein expression level, these differences were modest. For MSCs undergoing osteogenesis, gene expression results suggest that cylindrical pores may initially increase early osteogenic marker expression, while protein level expression at later timepoints is increased for scaffolds with ordered cubic pores. Taken together, these results suggest that 3D printed scaffolds with ordered cubic pores could be a suitable culture system for single-step MSC enrichment and differentiation.\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have great therapeutic potential, as they are capable of multilineage differentiation.

{"title": "A 3D-printed functioning anatomical human middle ear model.", "abstract": "The middle ear is a sophisticated and complex structure with a variety of functions, yet a delicate organ prone to injuries due to various reasons. Both, understanding and reconstructing its functions has always been an important topic for researchers from medical and technical background. Currently, human temporal bones are generally used as model for tests, experiments and validation of the numerical results. However, fresh human preparations are not always easily accessible and their mechanical properties vary with time and between individuals. Therefore we have built an anatomically based and functional middle ear model to serve as a reproducible test environment. Our middle ear model was manufactured with the aid of 3D-printing technology. We have segmented the essential functional elements from micro computed tomography data (\u03bcCT) of a single temporal bone. The ossicles were 3D-printed by selective laser melting (SLM) and the soft tissues were casted with silicone rubber into 3D-printed molds. The ear canal, the tympanic cavity and the inner ear were artificially designed, but their design ensured the anatomically correct position of the tympanic membrane, ossicular ligaments and the oval window. For the determination of their auditory properties we have conducted two kinds of tests: measurement of the stapes footplate response to sound and tympanometry of the model. Our experiments regarding the sound transmission showed that the model has a similar behavior to a human middle ear. The transfer function has a resonance frequency at around 1\u00a0kHz, the stapes' response is almost constant for frequencies below the resonance and a roll-off is observed above the resonance. The tympanometry results show that the compliance of the middle ear model is similar to the compliance of a healthy human middle ear. We also present that we were able to manipulate the transmission behavior, so that healthy or pathological scenarios can be created. For this purpose we have built models with different mechanical properties by varying the hardness of the silicone rubber used for different structures, such as tympanic membrane, oval window and ossicle attachments in the range of Shore 10-40 A. This allowed us to set the transmission amplitudes in the plateau region higher, lower or within the tolerances of normal middle ears (Rosowski et\u00a0al., 2007). Our results showed that it is possible to build an artificial model of the human middle ear by using 3D-printing technology in combination with silicone rubber molding. We were able to reproduce the anatomical shape of the middle ear's essential elements with high accuracy and also assemble them into a functioning middle ear model. The acoustic behavior of the model can be reproduced and manipulated by the choice of material. If the issues such as resonance of the casing and steep roll-off slope in higher frequencies can be solved, this model creates a reproducible environment for experiments and can be useful for the evaluation of prosthetic devices.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2016-01-17", "authors": ["IsmailKuru", "HannesMaier", "MathiasM\u00fcller", "ThomasLenarz", "Tim CLueth"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2015.12.025"}
{"title": "Fabrication of biomimetic vascular scaffolds for 3D tissue constructs using vascular corrosion casts.", "abstract": "Vascularization is among the most pressing technical challenges facing tissue engineering of 3D organs. While small engineered constructs can rely solely on vascular infiltration and diffusion from host tissues following implantation, larger avascular constructs do not survive long enough for vessel ingrowth to occur. To address this challenge, strategies for pre-vascularization of engineered constructs have been developed. Various biofabrication techniques have been utilized for pre-vascularization, but limitations exist with respect to the size and complexity of the resulting vessels. To this end, we developed a simple and novel fabrication method to create biomimetic microvascular scaffolds using vascular corrosion casting as a template for pre-vascularization of engineered tissue constructs. Gross and electron microscopic analysis demonstrates that polycaprolactone (PCL)-derived kidney vascular corrosion casts are able to capture the architecture of normal renal tissue and can serve as a sacrificial template for the creation of a collagen-based vascular scaffold. Histological analysis demonstrates that the collagen vascular scaffolds are biomimetic in structure and can be perfused, endothelialized, and embedded in hydrogel tissue constructs. Our scaffold creation method is simple, cost effective, and provides a biomimetic, tissue-specific option for pre-vascularization that is broadly applicable in tissue engineering.\nTissues in the body are vascularized to provide nutrients to the cells within the tissues and carry away waste, but creating tissue engineered constructs with functional vascular networks has been challenging. Current biofabrication techniques can incorporate blood vessel-like structures with straight or simple branching patterns into tissue constructs. Unfortunately, these techniques are expensive, complicated and create simplified versions of the complex vessel structures seen in native tissue. Our technique uses novel vascular corrosion casts of normal tissue as templates to create vascular scaffolds that are a copy of normal vessels. These vascular scaffolds can be easily incorporated into 3D tissue constructs. Our process is simple, inexpensive and inherently tissue-specific, making it widely applicable in the field of tissue engineering.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-01-17", "authors": ["JenniferHuling", "In KapKo", "AnthonyAtala", "James JYoo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.01.005"}
{"title": "3D Printing of Scaffold for Cells Delivery: Advances in Skin Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Injury or damage to tissue and organs is a major health problem, resulting in about half of the world's annual healthcare expenditure every year. Advances in the fields of stem cells (SCs) and biomaterials processing have provided a tremendous leap for researchers to manipulate the dynamics between these two, and obtain a skin substitute that can completely heal the wounded areas. Although wound healing needs a coordinated interplay between cells, extracellular proteins and growth factors, the most important players in this process are the endogenous SCs, which activate the repair cascade by recruiting cells from different sites. Extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins are activated by these SCs, which in turn aid in cellular migrations and finally secretion of growth factors that can seal and heal the wounds. The interaction between ECM proteins and SCs helps the skin to sustain the rigors of everyday activity, and in an attempt to attain this level of functionality in artificial three-dimensional (3D) constructs, tissue engineered biomaterials are fabricated using more advanced techniques such as bioprinting and laser assisted printing of the organs. This review provides a concise summary of the most recent advances that have been made in the area of polymer bio-fabrication using 3D bio printing used for encapsulating stem cells for skin regeneration.

{"title": "Hetero-cellular prototyping by synchronized multi-material bioprinting for rotary cell culture system.", "abstract": "Bottom-up tissue engineering requires methodological progress of biofabrication to capture key design facets of anatomical arrangements across micro, meso and macro-scales. The diffusive mass transfer properties necessary to elicit stability and functionality require hetero-typic contact, cell-to-cell signaling and uniform nutrient diffusion. Bioprinting techniques successfully build mathematically defined porous architecture to diminish resistance to mass transfer. Current limitations of bioprinted cell assemblies include poor micro-scale formability of cell-laden soft gels and asymmetrical macro-scale diffusion through 3D volumes. The objective of this work is to engineer a synchronized multi-material bioprinter (SMMB) system which improves the resolution and expands the capability of existing bioprinting systems by packaging multiple cell types in heterotypic arrays prior to deposition. This unit cell approach to arranging multiple cell-laden solutions is integrated with a motion system to print heterogeneous filaments as tissue engineered scaffolds and nanoliter droplets. The set of SMMB process parameters control the geometric arrangement of the combined flow's internal features and constituent material's volume fractions. SMMB printed hepatocyte-endothelial laden 200 nl droplets are cultured in a rotary cell culture system (RCCS) to study the effect of microgravity on an in vitro model of the human hepatic lobule. RCCS conditioning for 48 h increased hepatocyte cytoplasm diameter 2 \u03bcm, increased metabolic rate, and decreased drug half-life. SMMB hetero-cellular models present a 10-fold increase in metabolic rate, compared to SMMB mono-culture models. Improved bioprinting resolution due to process control of cell-laden matrix packaging as well as nanoliter droplet printing capability identify SMMB as a viable technique to improve in vitro model efficacy.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-01-14", "authors": ["JessicaSnyder", "Ae RinSon", "QudusHamid", "HongluWu", "WeiSun"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015002"}

The objective of this study was to fabricate skin phantoms with 3D printing technique to emulate various human skin types (I-VI) along with the corresponding optical and mechanical properties for laser tattoo removal.\nBoth gelatin and agar powders were mixed with coffee and TiO2 particles to fabricate skin phantoms with materials properties for various skin types (I-VI). A 3D printer was employed to precisely control the thickness of each phantom for epidermis and dermis layers. A number of concentrations of the coffee and TiO2 particles were used to determine the degree of absorption and scattering effects in various skin types. The optical properties between 500 and 1,000\u2009nm for the fabricated phantoms were measured by double-integrating spheres with an inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and rheometer were also utilized to evaluate optical (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) and mechanical properties (compression modulus) of the fabricated phantoms, respectively.\nVisible color inspections presented that the skin phantoms for types I, III, and VI similarly emulated the color space of the human skin types. The optical property measurements demonstrated that the absorption (\u03bca) and reduced scattering (\u03bc(s')) coefficients decreased with wavelengths. Compared to the human skin type VI, a dermis phantom represented quite equivalent values of \u03bca and \u03bc(s') whereas an epidermis phantom showed up to 30% lower \u03bca but almost identical \u03bc(s') over the wavelengths. The OCT measurements confirmed that the thicknesses of the epidermis and the dermis phantoms were measured to be 138.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009\u03bcm and 0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009mm, respectively. The mechanical properties of the phantoms mixed with the agar volume of 40% yielded a compression modulus of 83.7\u2009\u00b1\u200914.8\u2009kPa, which well corresponded to that of human forearm skin (50-95\u2009kPa).\nThe 3D printing technique was able to reliably fabricate the double-layered phantoms emulating a variety of skin types (I-VI) along with the comparable optical and mechanical properties. Further investigations will incorporate artificial chromophores into the fabricated skin phantoms to reliably evaluate the new therapeutic wavelengths for laser tattoo removal.", "journal": "Lasers in surgery and medicine", "date": "2016-01-11", "authors": ["HannaKim", "Nguyen TrungHau", "Yu-GyeongChae", "Byeong-IlLee", "Hyun WookKang"], "doi": "10.1002/lsm.22469"}
{"title": "3D bioprinted extracellular matrix mimics facilitate directed differentiation of epithelial progenitors for sweat gland regeneration.", "abstract": "Sweat glands perform a vital thermoregulatory function in mammals. Like other skin appendages, they originate from epidermal progenitors. However, they have low regenerative potential in response to injury, and whether adult epidermal progenitors could be specified to differentiate to a sweat gland cell lineage remains largely unexplored. We used bioprinting technology to create a functional in vitro cell-laden 3D extracellular matrix mimics (3D-ECM) with composite hydrogels based on gelatin and sodium alginate because of chemical and structural similarity to ECM components. To achieve specific cell differentiation, mouse plantar dermis and epidermal growth factor were synchronously incorporated into the 3D-ECM mimics to create an inductive niche for epidermal progenitor cells obtained from mice. The biological 3D construct could maintain cell viability, thereby facilitating cell spreading and matrix formation. In vitro data by immunofluorescence and gene expression assay of key cell-surface markers demonstrated that the bioprinted 3D-ECM could effectively create a restrictive niche for epidermal progenitors that ensures unilateral differentiation into sweat gland cells. Furthermore, direct delivery of bioprinted 3D-ECM into burned paws of mice resulted in functional restoration of sweat glands. This study represents the rational design to enhance the specific differentiation of epidermal lineages using 3D bioprinting and may have clinical and translational implications in regenerating sweat glands.\nSweat gland regeneration after injury is of clinical importance but remains largely unsolved because of low regenerative potential and lack of a definite niche. Some studies have shown sweat gland regeneration with gene-based interventions or cell-based induction via embryonic components, but translation to clinic is challenging. The novelty and significance of the work lies in the fact that we design a 3D bioprinted extracellular matrix that provides the spatial inductive cues for enhancing specific differentiation of epidermal lineages to regenerate sweat glands, which is critical for treating deep burns or other wounds. Our studies are encouraging given the overwhelming advantages of our designed 3D bioprinting construct over other cell delivery technology in maintaining high cell proliferation; another interesting finding is that adult tissue components retain a gland lineage-inductive power as embryonic tissue, which can facilitate translation.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-01-10", "authors": ["ShaHuang", "BinYao", "JiangfanXie", "XiaobingFu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.12.039"}
{"title": "Three-Dimensional-Printing of Bio-Inspired Composites.", "abstract": "Optimized for millions of years, natural materials often outperform synthetic materials due to their hierarchical structures and multifunctional abilities. They usually feature a complex architecture that consists of simple building blocks. Indeed, many natural materials such as bone, nacre, hair, and spider silk, have outstanding material properties, making them applicable to engineering applications that may require both mechanical resilience and environmental compatibility. However, such natural materials are very difficult to harvest in bulk, and may be toxic in the way they occur naturally, and therefore, it is critical to use alternative methods to fabricate materials that have material functions similar to material function as their natural counterparts for large-scale applications. Recent progress in additive manufacturing, especially the ability to print multiple materials at upper micrometer resolution, has given researchers an excellent instrument to design and reconstruct natural-inspired materials. The most advanced 3D-printer can now be used to manufacture samples to emulate their geometry and material composition with high fidelity. Its capabilities, in combination with computational modeling, have provided us even more opportunities for designing, optimizing, and testing the function of composite materials, in order to achieve composites of high mechanical resilience and reliability. In this review article, we focus on the advanced material properties of several multifunctional biological materials and discuss how the advanced 3D-printing techniques can be used to mimic their architectures and functions.

{"title": "Net shape fabrication of calcium phosphate scaffolds with multiple material domains.", "abstract": "Calcium phosphate (CaP) materials have been proven to be efficacious as bone scaffold materials, but are difficult to fabricate into complex architectures because of the high processing temperatures required. In contrast, polymeric materials are easily formed into scaffolds with near-net-shape forms of patient-specific defects and with domains of different materials; however, they have reduced load-bearing capacity compared to CaPs. To preserve the merits of CaP scaffolds and enable advanced scaffold manufacturing, this manuscript describes an additive manufacturing process that is coupled with a mold support for overhanging features; we demonstrate that this process enables the fabrication of CaP scaffolds that have both complex, near-net-shape contours and distinct domains with different microstructures. First, we use a set of canonical structures to study the manufacture of complex contours and distinct regions of different material domains within a mold. We then apply these capabilities to the fabrication of a scaffold that is designed for a 5 cm orbital socket defect.

{"title": "Novel method to improve vascularization of tissue engineered constructs with biodegradable fibers.", "abstract": "Tissue engineered grafts lack adequate vascularization and suffer from poor perfusion in vivo curtailing clinical application. Improving vascularization in any tissue implants would hence increase their survivability and treatment efficacy. Many prevascularization strategies established to date involves the angiogenic induction of endothelial progenitor cells in thick tissue engineered scaffolds to obtain vascularization. These 3D scaffolds typically require a dynamic cell culturing system involving/needful of bioreactors to obtain vascularization in thick tissue engineered scaffolds. Herein, we developed a novel method to engineer a vessel network without bioreactor, where 3D blood vessels could be simply obtained in a 2D static cell culturing system. This network could be used to augment the prevascularization of tissue engineered grafts. Endothelial cells (HUVECs) were confluently cultured on resorbable electrospun poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) microfibers of capillary dimensions. These cell encapsulated capillary fibers were further embedded in collagen with HUVECs and vascular endothelial growth factor. Green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein expressing HUVECs were used to label cells on fiber and in collagen respectively for visualization and monitoring of capillary network formation. Seeded HUVECs in the hybrid construct were subsequently cultured for 30 days before implantation. Vessel density was measured by the total tubule length per unit area at different time points. In vitro results indicated that the fibers provide contact guidance to form primary networks to direct more vessels branching of HUVECs in hybrid constructs and the vessel integrity of microvasculature was retained after fiber degradation. In addition, these preformed engineered capillaries could capably inosculate with de novo capillaries in collagen when combined, giving rise to a hybrid pre-vascularized scaffold of more extensive vessel network and interconnections, thereby markedly improved prevascularization. When implanted onto the dorsal skin of immune-deficient mice, vessels of hybrid pre-vascularized scaffold also rapidly anastomosed with mice vasculature within a day as confirmed with the immunostaining of endothelial cell markers CD31 and von Willebrand factor. This proof of concept study showed that artificial capillaries formed through contact guidance of endothelial cells on resorbable capillary sized microfibers can significantly enhance prevascularization in tissue engineered constructs intended for surgical implantation.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-01-08", "authors": ["Hui KianWong", "Chee RenIvan Lam", "FengWen", "Seow KhoonMark Chong", "Nguan SoonTan", "ChanJerry", "MintuPal", "Lay PohTan"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015004"}
{"title": "Macro- and micro-designed chitosan-alginate scaffold architecture by three-dimensional printing and directional freezing.", "abstract": "While many tissue-engineered constructs aim to treat cartilage defects, most involve chondrocyte or stem cell seeding on scaffolds. The clinical application of cell-based techniques is limited due to the cost of maintaining cellular constructs on the shelf, potential immune response to allogeneic cell lines, and autologous chondrocyte sources requiring biopsy from already diseased or injured, scarce tissue. An acellular scaffold that can induce endogenous influx and homogeneous distribution of native stem cells from bone marrow holds great promise for cartilage regeneration. This study aims to develop such an acellular scaffold using designed, channeled architecture that simultaneously models the native zones of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Highly porous, hydrophilic chitosan-alginate (Ch-Al) scaffolds were fabricated in three-dimensionally printed (3DP) molds designed to create millimeter scale macro-channels. Different polymer preform casting techniques were employed to produce scaffolds from both negative and positive 3DP molds. Macro-channeled scaffolds improved cell suspension distribution and uptake overly randomly porous scaffolds, with a wicking volumetric flow rate of 445.6 \u00b1 30.3 mm(3) s(-1) for aqueous solutions and 177 \u00b1 16 mm(3) s(-1) for blood. Additionally, directional freezing was applied to Ch-Al scaffolds, resulting in lamellar pores measuring 300 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm on the long and short axes, thus creating micrometer scale micro-channels. After directionally freezing Ch-Al solution cast in 3DP molds, the combined macro- and micro-channeled scaffold architecture enhanced cell suspension uptake beyond either macro- or micro-channels alone, reaching a volumetric flow rate of 1782.1 \u00b1 48 mm(3) s(-1) for aqueous solutions and 440.9 \u00b1 0.5 mm(3) s(-1) for blood. By combining 3DP and directional freezing, we can control the micro- and macro-architecture of Ch-Al to drastically improve cell influx into and distribution within the scaffold, while achieving porous zones that mimic articular cartilage zonal architecture.

Therefore, conventional treatment approaches fit poorly with genomic reality. Furthermore, it is likely that this type of complexity will also be observed in other illnesses. Precision medicine has been posited as a way to better target disease-related aberrations, but developing drugs and tailoring therapy to each patient's complicated problem is a major challenge. One solution would be to match patients to existing compounds based on in silico modeling. However, optimization of complex therapy will eventually require designing compounds for patients using computer modeling and just-in-time production, perhaps achievable in the future by three-dimensional (3D) printing. Indeed, 3D printing is potentially transformative by virtue of its ability to rapidly generate almost limitless numbers of objects that previously required manufacturing facilities. Companies are already endeavoring to develop affordable 3D printers for home use. An attractive, but as yet scantily explored, application is to place chemical design and production under digital control.

These models were fitted with printed valves and predictions regarding post-implant PAR were made using a light transmission test.\nAortic root 3D models were highly accurate, with excellent agreement between annulus measurements made on 3D models and those made on corresponding 2D data (mean difference of\u00a0-0.34\u00a0mm, 95% limits of agreement: \u00b1 1.3\u00a0mm).

{"title": "Multipurpose effectiveness of Couroupita guianensis-synthesized gold nanoparticles: high antiplasmodial potential, field efficacy against malaria vectors and synergy with Aplocheilus lineatus predators.", "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases represent a deadly threat for millions of people worldwide. According to recent estimates, about 3.2 billion people, almost half of the world's population, are at risk of malaria. Malaria control is particularly challenging due to a growing number of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium and pesticide-resistant Anopheles vectors. Newer and safer control tools are required. In this research, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were biosynthesized using a cheap flower extract of Couroupita guianensis as reducing and stabilizing agent. The biofabrication of AuNP was confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential, and particle size analysis. AuNP showed different shapes including spheres, ovals, and triangles. AuNPs were crystalline in nature with face-centered cubic geometry; mean size was 29.2-43.8\u00a0nm. In laboratory conditions, AuNPs were toxic against Anopheles stephensi larvae, pupae, and adults. LC50 was 17.36\u00a0ppm (larva I), 19.79\u00a0ppm (larva II), 21.69\u00a0ppm (larva III), 24.57\u00a0ppm (larva IV), 28.78\u00a0ppm (pupa), and 11.23\u00a0ppm (adult). In the field, a single treatment with C. guianensis flower extract and AuNP (10\u2009\u00d7\u2009LC50) led to complete larval mortality after 72\u00a0h. In standard laboratory conditions, the predation efficiency of golden wonder killifish, Aplocheilus lineatus, against A. stephensi IV instar larvae was 56.38\u00a0%, while in an aquatic environment treated with sub-lethal doses of the flower extract or AuNP, predation efficiency was boosted to 83.98 and 98.04\u00a0%, respectively. Lastly, the antiplasmodial activity of C. guianensis flower extract and AuNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. IC50 of C. guianensis flower extract was 43.21\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (CQ-s) and 51.16\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (CQ-r). AuNP IC50 was 69.47\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (CQ-s) and 76.33\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (CQ-r).

These critical parameters vary widely between the different arteries in the human body, and the ability to engineer vessels of varying sizes could increase capabilities for disease modeling and treatment options. We present an innovative method for producing customizable, tissue engineered, self-organizing vascular constructs by replicating a major structural component of blood vessels - the smooth muscle layer, or tunica media. We utilize a unique system combining 3D printed plate inserts to control construct size and shape, and cell sheets supported by a temporary fibrin hydrogel to encourage cellular self-organization into a tubular form resembling a natural artery. To form the vascular construct, 3D printed inserts are adhered to tissue culture plates, fibrin hydrogel is deposited around the inserts, and human aortic smooth muscle cells are then seeded atop the fibrin hydrogel. The gel, aided by the innate contractile properties of the smooth muscle cells, aggregates towards the center post insert, creating a tissue ring of smooth muscle cells. These rings are then stacked into the final tubular construct. Our methodology is robust, easily repeatable and allows for customization of cellular composition, vessel wall thickness, and length of the vessel construct merely by varying the size of the 3D printed inserts. This platform has potential for facilitating more accurate modeling of vascular pathology, serving as a drug discovery tool, or for vessel repair in disease treatment.", "journal": "Methods (San Diego, Calif.)", "date": "2016-01-07", "authors": ["Cameron BPinnock", "Elizabeth MMeier", "Neeraj NJoshi", "BinWu", "Mai TLam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.12.015"}

While deployment from a small, regular shape to a larger one is easy to design, we focus on a more challenging task: designing a planar scissor structure that deploys from a given source shape into a specific target shape. We propose a two-step constructive method to generate a scissor structure from a high-dimensional parameter space. Topology construction of the scissor structure is first performed to approximate the two given shapes, as well as to guarantee the deployment. Then the geometry of the scissor structure is optimized in order to minimize the connection deflections and maximize the shape approximation. With the optimized parameters, the deployment can be simulated by controlling an anchor scissor unit. Physical deployable objects are fabricated according to the designed scissor structures by using 3D printing or manual assembly.

As part of the central nervous system, RGCs are unable to regenerate following injury, and implanted cells have limited capacity to orient and integrate in vivo. During development, secreted guidance molecules along with signals from extracellular matrix and the vasculature guide cell positioning, for example, around the fovea, and axon outgrowth; however, these changes are temporally regulated and are not the same in the adult. Here, we combine electrospun cell transplantation scaffolds capable of RGC neurite guidance with thermal inkjet 3D cell printing techniques capable of precise positioning of RGCs on the scaffold surface. Optimal printing parameters are developed for viability, electrophysiological function and, neurite pathfinding. Different media, commonly used to promote RGC survival and growth, were tested under varying conditions. When printed in growth media containing both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), RGCs maintained survival and normal electrophysiological function, and displayed radial axon outgrowth when printed onto electrospun scaffolds.

{"title": "A Diffusion-Based and Dynamic 3D-Printed Device That Enables Parallel in Vitro Pharmacokinetic Profiling of Molecules.", "abstract": "The process of bringing a drug to market involves many steps, including the preclinical stage, where various properties of the drug candidate molecule are determined. These properties, which include drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, are often displayed in a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. While PK profiles are determined in animal models, in vitro systems that model in vivo processes are available, although each possesses shortcomings. Here, we present a 3D-printed, diffusion-based, and dynamic in vitro PK device. The device contains six flow channels, each with integrated porous membrane-based insert wells. The pores of these membranes enable drugs to freely diffuse back and forth between the flow channels and the inserts, thus enabling both loading and clearance portions of a standard PK curve to be generated. The device is designed to work with 96-well plate technology and consumes single-digit milliliter volumes to generate multiple PK profiles, simultaneously. Generation of PK profiles by use of the device was initially performed with fluorescein as a test molecule. Effects of such parameters as flow rate, loading time, volume in the insert well, and initial concentration of the test molecule were investigated. A prediction model was generated from this data, enabling the user to predict the concentration of the test molecule at any point along the PK profile within a coefficient of variation of \u223c 5%. Depletion of the analyte from the well was characterized and was determined to follow first-order rate kinetics, indicated by statistically equivalent (p > 0.05) depletion half-lives that were independent of the starting concentration.

{"title": "3D printed microfluidic circuitry via multijet-based additive manufacturing.", "abstract": "The miniaturization of integrated fluidic processors affords extensive benefits for chemical and biological fields, yet traditional, monolithic methods of microfabrication present numerous obstacles for the scaling of fluidic operators. Recently, researchers have investigated the use of additive manufacturing or \"three-dimensional (3D) printing\" technologies - predominantly stereolithography - as a promising alternative for the construction of submillimeter-scale fluidic components. One challenge, however, is that current stereolithography methods lack the ability to simultaneously print sacrificial support materials, which limits the geometric versatility of such approaches. In this work, we investigate the use of multijet modelling (alternatively, polyjet printing) - a layer-by-layer, multi-material inkjetting process - for 3D printing geometrically complex, yet functionally advantageous fluidic components comprised of both static and dynamic physical elements. We examine a fundamental class of 3D printed microfluidic operators, including fluidic capacitors, fluidic diodes, and fluidic transistors. In addition, we evaluate the potential to advance on-chip automation of integrated fluidic systems via geometric modification of component parameters. Theoretical and experimental results for 3D fluidic capacitors demonstrated that transitioning from planar to non-planar diaphragm architectures improved component performance. Flow rectification experiments for 3D printed fluidic diodes revealed a diodicity of 80.6 \u00b1 1.8. Geometry-based gain enhancement for 3D printed fluidic transistors yielded pressure gain of 3.01 \u00b1 0.78.

In this study, we applied Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods to investigating the bonding mechanism and essence of binders on the HA crystallographic planes for 3DP fabrication bone scaffolds. The cohesive energy densities of binders and the binding energies, PCFs g(r), mechanical properties of binder/HA interaction models were analyzed through the MD simulation. Additionally, we prepared the HA bone scaffold specimens with different glues by 3DP additive manufacturing, and tested their mechanical properties by the electronic universal testing machine. The simulation results revealed that the relationship of the binding energies between binders and HA surface is consistent with the cohesive energy densities of binders, which is PAM/HA>PVA/HA>PVP/HA. The PCFs g(r) indicated that their interfacial interactions mainly attribute to the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds which formed between the polar atoms, functional groups in binder polymer and the Ca, -OH in HA. The results of mechanical experiments verified the relationship of Young\u05f3s modulus for three interaction models in simulation, which is PVA/HA>PAM/HA>PVP/HA. But the trend of compressive strength is PAM/HA>PVA/HA>PVP/HA, this is consistent with the binding energies of simulation. Therefore, the Young\u05f3s modulus of bone scaffolds are limited by the Young\u05f3s modulus of binders, and the compressive strength is mainly decided by the viscosity of binder. Finally, the major reasons for differences in mechanical properties between simulation and experiment were found, the space among HA pellets and the incomplete infiltration of glue were the main reasons influencing the mechanical properties of 3DP fabrication HA bone scaffolds.

{"title": "Multiple Sensor Detection of Process Phenomena in Laser Powder Bed Fusion.", "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process in which a high power laser melts metal powder layers into complex, three-dimensional shapes. LPBF parts are known to exhibit relatively high residual stresses, anisotropic microstructure, and a variety of defects. To mitigate these issues, in-situ measurements of the melt-pool phenomena may illustrate relationships between part quality and process signatures. However, phenomena such as spatter, plume formation, laser modulation, and melt-pool oscillations may require data acquisition rates exceeding 10 kHz. This hinders use of relatively data-intensive, streaming imaging sensors in a real-time monitoring and feedback control system. Single-point sensors such as photodiodes provide the temporal bandwidth to capture process signatures, while providing little spatial information. This paper presents results from experiments conducted on a commercial LPBF machine which incorporated synchronized, in-situ acquisition of a thermal camera, high-speed visible camera, photodiode, and laser modulation signal during fabrication of a nickel alloy 625 AM part with an overhang geometry. Data from the thermal camera provides temperature information, the visible camera provides observation of spatter, and the photodiode signal provides high temporal bandwidth relative brightness stemming from the melt pool region. In addition, joint-time frequency analysis (JTFA) was performed on the photodiode signal. JTFA results indicate what digital filtering and signal processing are required to highlight particular signatures.

This applies to both additive (3D printing) and subtractive (material removal by machining) manufacturing. Performing accurate single wavelength thermography suffers numerous challenges. A potential alternative is hyperpixel array hyperspectral imaging. Focusing on metals, this paper discusses issues involved such as unknown or changing emissivity, inaccurate greybody assumptions, motion blur, and size of source effects. The algorithm which converts measured thermal spectra to emissivity and temperature uses a customized multistep non-linear equation solver to determine the best-fit emission curve. Emissivity dependence on wavelength may be assumed uniform or have a relationship typical for metals. The custom software displays residuals for intensity, temperature, and emissivity to gauge the correctness of the greybody assumption. Initial results are shown from a laser powder-bed fusion additive process, as well as a machining process. In addition, the effects of motion blur are analyzed, which occurs in both additive and subtractive manufacturing processes. In a laser powder-bed fusion additive process, the scanning laser causes the melt pool to move rapidly, causing a motion blur-like effect. In machining, measuring temperature of the rapidly moving chip is a desirable goal to develop and validate simulations of the cutting process. A moving slit target is imaged to characterize how the measured temperature values are affected by motion of a measured target.", "journal": "Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["EricWhitenton", "JarredHeigel", "BrandonLane", "ShawnMoylan"], "doi": "10.1117/12.2222575"}

In the present study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by using root extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra an important medicinal plant. The AgNPs are characterized by spectral analysis; the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of AgNPs showed maximum absorption at 445\u00a0nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) data show that the O-H hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids, ester and ether groups and C-O stretching of alcohols have been utilized in the formation of AgNPs. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data reveal that the AgNPs are face-centered cubic (fcc) in structure. The size was determined by particle size analyzer and atomic force microscope (AFM); the results reveal that AgNPs were spherical in shape and the average grain size is determined as 41.5-46.5\u00a0nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs obtained show that AgNPs were roughly spherical and well dispersed with the sizes ranging from 10 to 45\u00a0nm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0nm. The biofabricated AgNPs are extremely stable due to its high negative zeta potential -34.1\u00a0mV which indicates that the nanoparticles are polydispered in nature.

On the basis of aforesaid premise, the present study deals with the optimization and fabrication of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) using easily available bio-resource, Delonix regia leaf extract. The use of practically nontoxic natural extracts and water allows the synthesis pathways presented to be considered as ''green'' and so permitting the synthesized Au-NPs to be used in sensitive areas, such as bioremediation. Various characterization techniques are adopted for the evaluation of size, stability, morphology, crystal nature, and purity of nanoparticles. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy analysis showed a surface Plasmon resonance peak for prepared Au-NPs at 542\u00a0nm, and its absorbance increased with increasing the interaction time. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the particles were spherical and 4-24\u00a0nm in size. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis displayed a 2.2\u00a0keV peak corresponding to the pure phase gold nanocrystal. X-ray diffraction analysis proved the fabrication of crystalline Au-NPs with face-centered cubic geometry within 10\u00a0min. Furthermore, \u03b6 potential (-15\u00a0mV) and Fourier transform infrared data suggested the role of polar polyphenolic compounds of leaf extract in fabrication and stabilization process.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling is a common numerical approach to study flow, but it requires a cautious and rigorous application for meaningful results. Left main bifurcation angles of 40\u00b0, 80\u00b0 and 110\u00b0 were found to represent the spread of an atlas based 100 computed tomography angiograms. Three left mains with these bifurcation angles were reconstructed with 1) idealized, 2) stented, and 3) patient-specific geometry.

For group 1 (9 patients), patient-specific guides were designed and manufactured using additive manufacturing technology. During surgery, the guides were used to define the orientation of the reduced fragments. The scaphoids in group 2 (13 patients) were reduced with the conventional freehand technique. All scaphoids in both groups were fixed with a headless compression screw or K-wires, and all bone defects (except one) were filled with autologous bone grafts or vascularized grafts. Postoperative CT scans were acquired 2 or more months after the operations to monitor consolidation and compare the final result with the preoperative plan. The clinical results and accuracy of the reconstructions were compared.\nIn group 1, 8 of 9 scaphoids healed after 2 to 6 months, and partial nonunion after 9 months was observed in one patient. In group 2, 11 of 13 scaphoids healed between 2 and 34 months whereas 2 scaphoids did not consolidate. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative 3-dimensional data revealed an average residual displacement of 7\u00b0 (4\u00b0 in flexion-extension, 4\u00b0 in ulnar-radial deviation, and 3\u00b0 in pronation-supination) in group 1.

Composite filament was obtained by extrusion. Mechanical properties, structural characteristics and shape memory effect (SME) were studied. Direct heating was used for activation of SME. The average pore size and porosity of the scaffolds were 700\u03bcm and 30vol%, respectively. Dispersed particles of HA acted as nucleation centers during the ordering of PLA molecular chains and formed an additional rigid fixed phase that reduced molecular mobility, which led to a shift of the onset of recovery stress growth from 53 to 57\u00b0C. A more rapid development of stresses was observed for PLA/HA composites with the maximum recovery stress of 3.0MPa at 70\u00b0C. Ceramic particles inhibited the growth of cracks during compression-heating-compression cycles when porous PLA/HA 3D-scaffolds recovered their initial shape. Shape recovery at the last cycle was about 96%. SME during heating may have resulted in \"self-healing\" of scaffold by narrowing the cracks. PLA/HA 3D-scaffolds were found to withstand up to three compression-heating-compression cycles without delamination.

Within 20 h of incubation, the more sulfated coatings induced the HUVECS to the form tube-like structures accompanied by an increased expression of angiogenic-associated genes, such as angiopoietin-1 and VEGF A. This may be a cost-effective approach to modify 2D/3D constructs to instruct angiogenic cells towards the formation of neo-vascularization, driven by multiple and synergistic stimulations from the PL combined with sulfated polysaccharides.\nThe presence, or fast induction, of a stable and mature vasculature inside 3D constructs is crucial for new tissue formation and its viability. This has been one of the major tissue engineering challenges, limiting the dimensions of efficient tissue constructs.

In addition, the authors also explored the effects of Mg ions on the odontogenesis and angiogenesis differentiation of hPDLs in comparison with CS cement. The proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, odontogenesis-related genes (DSPP and DMP-1), and angiogenesis-related protein (vWF and ang-1) secretion of hPDLs were significantly stimulated when the Mg content of the specimen was increased.

The micro-architecture of the porous biomaterials and, thus, their physical properties could then be precisely controlled. Due to their many favorable properties, porous biomaterials manufactured using AM are considered as promising candidates for bone substitution as well as for several other applications in orthopedic surgery. The mechanical properties of such porous structures including static and fatigue properties are shown to be strongly dependent on the type of the repeating unit cell based on which the porous biomaterial is built. In this paper, we study the mechanical properties of porous biomaterials made from a relatively new unit cell, namely truncated cube. We present analytical solutions that relate the dimensions of the repeating unit cell to the elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and buckling load of those porous structures. We also performed finite element modeling to predict the mechanical properties of the porous structures. The analytical solution and computational results were found to be in agreement with each other. The mechanical properties estimated using both the analytical and computational techniques were somewhat higher than the experimental data reported in one of our recent studies on selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4V porous biomaterials. In addition to porosity, the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the porous structures were found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the length of the inclined struts to that of the uninclined (i.e. vertical or horizontal) struts, \u03b1, in the truncated cube unit cell. The geometry of the truncated cube unit cell approaches the octahedral and cube unit cells when \u03b1 respectively approaches zero and infinity.

{"title": "Combining 3D human in vitro methods for a 3Rs evaluation of novel titanium surfaces in orthopaedic applications.", "abstract": "In this study, we report on a group of complementary human osteoblast in vitro test methods for the preclinical evaluation of 3D porous titanium surfaces. The surfaces were prepared by additive manufacturing (electron beam melting [EBM]) and plasma spraying, allowing the creation of complex lattice surface geometries. Physical properties of the surfaces were characterized by SEM and profilometry and 3D in vitro cell culture using human osteoblasts. Primary human osteoblast cells were found to elicit greater differences between titanium sample surfaces than an MG63 osteoblast-like cell line, particularly in terms of cell survival. Surface morphology was associated with higher osteoblast metabolic activity and mineralization on rougher titanium plasma spray coated surfaces than smoother surfaces. Differences in osteoblast survival and metabolic activity on titanium lattice structures were also found, despite analogous surface morphology at the cellular level. 3D confocal microscopy identified osteoblast organization within complex titanium surface geometries, adhesion, spreading, and alignment to the biomaterial strut geometries. Mineralized nodule formation throughout the lattice structures was also observed, and indicative of early markers of bone in-growth on such materials.

A high-resolution projection stereolithography apparatus (\u03bcSLA) capable of multimaterial and grayscale 3D patterning of cells and biomaterials at <5 \u03bcm resolution is presented. Murine cells (fibroblasts, myoblasts, endothelial, and bone marrow stromal cells) encapsulated within photosensitive hydrogels using the \u03bcSLA remain viable up to two weeks after fabrication. Harnessing the high-resolution fabrication capabilities of this machine, sub-millimeter scale angiogenic cell-encapsulating patches designed to promote targeted growth of neovasculature are printed, as assessed in vitro via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in ovo via a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). This application establishes the \u03bcSLA as an enabling technology that is widely adaptable to any application that requires high-resolution patterning of cells and cells signals. By providing an efficient and robust method of engineering microscale tissues with encapsulated cells, this apparatus has a range of applications including fundamental studies of extracellular matrix interactions, high throughput drug testing of physiologically relevant substitutes for native tissue, and programmable tissue engineering for applications in regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2015-12-24", "authors": ["RituRaman", "BasantaBhaduri", "MustafaMir", "ArtemShkumatov", "Min KyungLee", "GabrielPopescu", "HyunjoonKong", "RashidBashir"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500721"}

This study investigated the survival outcomes of segmental tracheal reconstruction using 3D printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with or without asymmetrically porous membrane in rabbit animal model.\nAnimal study.\nSix mature New Zealand white rabbits were categorized into two groups (three animals for each) according to the procedures they received: tracheal reconstruction using 3D printed PCL scaffold without asymmetrically porous membrane (group 1) versus with asymmetrically porous membrane (group 2). We compared the endoscopic findings of tracheal lumen, radiologic assessment using microcomputed tomography (CT) scanner and histologic findings. Overall survival duration after procedure was compared in both groups.\nThe survival of group 2 was longer than group 1 (21, 37, 46 days vs. 4, 10, 12 days, respectively). Although mucosal regeneration in tracheal lumen was not full enough in both groups, the patency was well maintained in group 2. Micro-CT and histologic analysis showed that there were tracheal narrowing in the whole length in group 1, whereas only the anastomosis site was stenotic in group 2.\nAsymmetrically porous membrane reinforced by 3D printed mesh is promising as a 360-degree tracheal substitute with comparable survival and luminal patency. Further study is necessary to minimize the narrowing of the anastomosis site and improve the mucosal regeneration for longer survival.\nNA.

We performed an experiment using a 3D-printed BA model and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) to explore the hemodynamic property of the post-stenotic area and the mechanism of PPI.\n3D-model of a BA stenosis was reconstructed with silicone compound using a 3D-printer based on the source image of HR-MRI. Working fluid seeded with fluorescence particles was used and the velocity of those particles was measured horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, microtubules were inserted into the posterior aspect of the model to measure the flow rates of perforators (pre-and post-stenotic areas). The flow rates were compared between the microtubules.\nA recirculating flow was observed from the post-stenotic area in both directions forming a spiral shape. The velocity of the flow in these regions of recirculation was about one-tenth that of the flow in other regions. The location of recirculating flow well corresponded with the area with low-signal intensity at the time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and the location of PPI. Finally, the flow rate through the microtubule inserted into the post-stenotic area was significantly decreased comparing to others (P<0.001).\nPerforator infarction may be caused by a hemodynamic mechanism altered by stenosis that induces a recirculation flow. 3D-printed modeling and PIV are helpful understanding the hemodynamics of intracranial stenosis.", "journal": "Journal of stroke", "date": "2015-12-22", "authors": ["Bum JoonKim", "HojinHa", "Hyung KyuHuh", "Guk BaeKim", "Jong SKim", "NamkugKim", "Sang-JoonLee", "Dong-WhaKang", "Sun UKwon"], "doi": "10.5853/jos.2015.01445"}

Hence, our goal was to develop a novel AD brain detection method.\nIn this study, our method was based on the three-dimensional (3D) displacement-field (DF) estimation between subjects in the healthy elder control group and AD group. The 3D-DF was treated with AD-related features. The three feature selection measures were used in the Bhattacharyya distance, Student's t-test, and Welch's t-test (WTT). Two non-parallel support vector machines, i.e., generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine and twin support vector machine (TSVM), were then used for classification.

Micro-extrusion 3D printing strategies enabled the assembly of biomimetic scaffold components (microchannels and compartmented chambers) for the alignment of axonal networks and spatial organization of cellular components. Physiologically relevant studies of nervous system infection using the multiscale biomimetic device demonstrated the functionality of the in vitro platform. We found that Schwann cells participate in axon-to-cell viral spread but appear refractory to infection, exhibiting a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.4 genomes per cell.

Despite technological advances that have aided planning and execution of these procedures, surgical inaccuracy is not insignificant. One source of error that has not been wholly addressed is that attributable to a human operator. In this study, we investigate the feasibility and accuracy of performing osteotomies robotically in pre-programmed fashion for fibula free flap mandible reconstruction as a method to reduce inaccuracies related to human error. A mandibular defect and corresponding free fibula flap reconstruction requiring six osteotomies were designed on a CAD platform. A methodology was developed to translate this virtual surgical plan data to a robot (KUKA, Augsburgs, Germany), which then executed osteotomies on three-dimensional (3D) printed fibula flaps with the aid of dynamic stereotactic navigation. Using high-resolution computed tomography, the osteotomized segments were compared to the virtually planned segments in order to measure linear and angular accuracy. A total of 18 robotic osteotomies were performed on three 3D printed fibulas. Compared to the virtual preoperative plan, the average linear variation of the osteotomized segments was 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm, and the average angular variation was 4.2 \u00b1 1.7\u00b0.

The proposed work uses a novel multiresolution topology optimization method to achieve the task. Using a compliance minimization objective, patient-specific bone replacement shapes can be designed for different clinical cases that ensure revival of efficient load transfer mechanisms in the mid-face. In this work, four clinical cases are introduced and their respective patient-specific designs are obtained using the proposed method. The optimized designs are then virtually inserted into the defect to visually inspect the viability of the design . Further, once the design is verified by the reconstructive surgeon, prototypes are fabricated using a 3D printer for validation. The robustness of the designs are mechanically tested by subjecting them to a physiological loading condition which mimics the masticatory activity. The full-field strain result through 3D image correlation and the finite element analysis implies that the solution can survive the maximum mastication of 120 lb.

However, the optimal pore structure of porous titanium manufactured by SLM remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effect of pore size with constant porosity on in vivo bone ingrowth in rabbits into porous titanium implants manufactured by SLM. Three porous titanium implants (with an intended porosity of 65% and pore sizes of 300, 600, and 900\u03bcm, designated the P300, P600, and P900 implants, respectively) were manufactured by SLM. A diamond lattice was adapted as the basic structure. Their porous structures were evaluated and verified using microfocus X-ray computed tomography. Their bone-implant fixation ability was evaluated by their implantation as porous-surfaced titanium plates into the cortical bone of the rabbit tibia. Bone ingrowth was evaluated by their implantation as cylindrical porous titanium implants into the cancellous bone of the rabbit femur for 2, 4, and 8weeks.

In this study, the biosynthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs by both \"conventional heating\" (CH) and \"microwave irradiation\" (MI) methods has been reported. Stable and spherical ZnONPs were produced using zinc nitrate and flesh extract of Rosa canina fruit (rosehip) which was used as a precursor. The flesh extract acts as a reducing and capping agent for generation of ZnONPs. The structural, morphological and colloidal properties of the as-synthesized NPs have been confirmed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). In comparison with the CH method, the MI method has some advantages such as significantly short reaction time (within 8min) owing to the high heating rate and thus the accelerated reaction rate. Both methods led to the synthesis of nearly identical NPs with respect to shape and size according to the results of DLS, XRD and SEM techniques. The possible mechanism for synthesis pathway has been proposed based on FT IR results, XRD patterns, potentiometric data and antioxidant activity. In addition, the antibacterial activity of as-prepared ZnONPs was investigated against several bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium. Moreover, the efficacy of ZnONPs to treat cancer cell lines were measured by means of cell viability test via MTT assay in which concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1mg/mL of ZnONPs induced a very low toxicity.

In this study we present the design, modeling, rapid manufacturing and in vitro testing of a composite scaffold aimed at osteochondral repair. The presented composite scaffold stands out for having a functional gradient of density and stiffness in the bony phase, obtained in titanium by means of computer-aided design combined with additive manufacture using selective laser sintering. The chondral phase is obtained by sugar leaching, using a PDMS matrix and sugar as porogen, and is joined to the bony phase during the polymerization of PDMS, therefore avoiding the use of supporting adhesives or additional intermediate layers. The mechanical performance of the construct is biomimetic and the stiffness values of the bony and chondral phases can be tuned to the desired applications, by means of controlled modifications of different parameters.

Using finite element methodology, 15 configurations--combinations of simplified synthetic geometric shapes (circular, square, triangular, irregular) and interface angulations--were simulated under 50N static loads. Furthermore, the implant fixation devices were modelled and analysed in detail. Negative osteotomy configurations demonstrated the largest stresses in the implant (275 MPa), fixation devices (1258 MPa) and bone strains (0.04). The circular implant with zero and positive osteotomy performed well with maximum observed magnitudes of--implant stress (1.2 MPa and 1.2 MPa), fixation device stress (11.2 MPa and 2.2 MPa), bone strain (0.218e-3 and 0.750e-4). The results suggest that the preparation of defect sites is a critical procedure. Of the greatest importance is the angle at which the edges of the defect are sawed. If under an external load, the implant has no support from the interface and the stresses are transferred to the fixation devices. This can endanger their material integrity and lead to unphysiological strains in the adjacent bone, potentially compromising the bone morphology required for anchoring.

We assessed the biocompatibility of four commercially available 3D printing polymers (VisiJetCrystal EX200, Watershed 11122XC, Fototec SLA 7150 Clear and ABSplus P-430), through the observation of key developmental markers in the developing zebrafish embryos. Results show all of the photopolymers to be highly toxic to the embryos, resulting in fatality, although we do demonstrate that post-printing treatment of Fototec 7150 makes it suitable for zebrafish culture within the FET.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2015-12-10", "authors": ["N PMacdonald", "FZhu", "C JHall", "JReboud", "P SCrosier", "E EPatton", "DWlodkowic", "J MCooper"], "doi": "10.1039/c5lc01374g\n10.1117/12.454606\n10.1117/12.2180743\n10.1021/acs.estlett.5b00249"}
{"title": "Mesoscopic Fluorescence Molecular Tomography for Evaluating Engineered Tissues.", "abstract": "Optimization of regenerative medicine strategies includes the design of biomaterials, development of cell-seeding methods, and control of cell-biomaterial interactions within the engineered tissues. Among these steps, one paramount challenge is to non-destructively image the engineered tissues in their entirety to assess structure, function, and molecular expression. It is especially important to be able to enable cell phenotyping and monitor the distribution and migration of cells throughout the bulk scaffold. Advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques are commonly employed to perform such tasks; however, they are limited to superficial examination of tissue constructs. Therefore, the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine would greatly benefit from the development of molecular imaging techniques which are capable of non-destructive imaging of three-dimensional cellular distribution and maturation within a tissue-engineered scaffold beyond the limited depth of current microscopic techniques. In this review, we focus on an emerging depth-resolved optical mesoscopic imaging technique, termed laminar optical tomography (LOT) or mesoscopic fluorescence molecular tomography (MFMT), which enables longitudinal imaging of cellular distribution in thick tissue engineering constructs at depths of a few millimeters and with relatively high resolution. The physical principle, image formation, and instrumentation of LOT/MFMT systems are introduced.

{"title": "Strength reliability and in vitro degradation of three-dimensional powder printed strontium-substituted magnesium phosphate scaffolds.", "abstract": "Strontium ions (Sr(2+)) are known to prevent osteoporosis and also encourage bone formation. Such twin requirements have motivated researchers to develop Sr-substituted biomaterials for orthopaedic applications. The present study demonstrates a new concept of developing Sr-substituted Mg3(PO4)2 - based biodegradable scaffolds. In particular, this work reports the fabrication, mechanical properties with an emphasis on strength reliability as well as in vitro degradation of highly biodegradable strontium-incorporated magnesium phosphate cements. These implantable scaffolds were fabricated using three-dimensional powder printing, followed by high temperature sintering and/or chemical conversion, a technique adaptable to develop patient-specific implants. A moderate combination of strength properties of 36.7MPa (compression), 24.2MPa (bending) and 10.7MPa (tension) were measured. A reasonably modest Weibull modulus of up to 8.8 was recorded after uniaxial compression or diametral tensile tests on 3D printed scaffolds. A comparison among scaffolds with varying compositions or among sintered or chemically hardened scaffolds reveals that the strength reliability is not compromised in Sr-substituted scaffolds compared to baseline Mg3(PO4)2. The micro-computed tomography analysis reveals the presence of highly interconnected porous architecture in three-dimension with lognormal pore size distribution having median in the range of 17.74-26.29\u03bcm for the investigated scaffolds. The results of extensive in vitro ion release study revealed passive degradation with a reduced Mg(2+) release and slow but sustained release of Sr(2+) from strontium-substituted magnesium phosphate scaffolds. Taken together, the present study unequivocally illustrates that the newly designed Sr-substituted magnesium phosphate scaffolds with good strength reliability could be used for biomedical applications requiring consistent Sr(2+)- release, while the scaffold degrades in physiological medium.\nThe study investigates the additive manufacturing of scaffolds based on different strontium-substituted magnesium phosphate bone cements by means of three-dimensional powder printing technique (3DPP). Magnesium phosphates were chosen due to their higher biodegradability compared to calcium phosphates, which is due to both a higher solubility as well as the absence of phase changes (to low soluble hydroxyapatite) in vivo. Since strontium ions are known to promote bone formation by stimulating osteoblast growth, we aimed to establish such a highly degradable magnesium phosphate ceramic with an enhanced bioactivity for new bone ingrowth. After post-processing, mechanical strengths of up to 36.7MPa (compression), 24.2MPa (bending) and 10.7MPa (tension) could be achieved. Simultaneously, the failure reliability of those bioceramic implant materials, measured by Weibull modulus calculations, were in the range of 4.3-8.8. Passive dissolution studies in vitro proved an ion release of Mg(2+) and PO4(3-) as well as Sr(2+), which is fundamental for in vivo degradation and a bone growth promoting effect. In our opinion, this work broadens the range of bioceramic bone replacement materials suitable for additive manufacturing processing. The high biodegradability of MPC ceramics together with the anticipated promoting effect on osseointegration opens up the way for a patient-specific treatment with the prospect of a fast and complete healing of bone fractures.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-12-02", "authors": ["SusanneMeininger", "SouravMandal", "AlokKumar", "J\u00fcrgenGroll", "BikramjitBasu", "UweGbureck"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.050"}

By using a computer-aided deposition process, a unique control over pore size and interconnectivity of the resulting scaffolds is achieved, features highly interesting for tissue engineering applications. However, MEW has been mainly used to process low melting point thermoplastics such as poly(\u03b5-caprolactone). Since this polymer exhibits creep and a reduction in modulus upon hydration, we manufactured scaffolds of poly(L-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone-co-acryloyl carbonate) (poly(LLA-\u03b5-CL-AC)), a photo-cross-linkable and biodegradable polymer, for the first time. We show that the stiffness of the scaffolds increases significantly (up to \u223c10-fold) after cross-linking by UV irradiation at room temperature, compared with un-cross-linked microfiber scaffolds. The preservation of stiffness and high average fiber modulus (370 \u00b1 166 MPa) within the cross-linked hydrated scaffolds upon repetitive loading (10% strain at 1 Hz up to 200,000 cycles) suggests that the prepared scaffolds may be of potential interest for soft connective tissue engineering applications.

Therein we demonstrate a procedure to 'protoype a model', as category theory enables us to maintain certain information across disparate fields of study, distinct scales, or physical realizations. This process fits naturally with prototyping, as a prototype is not a complete product but rather a reduction to test a subset of properties. To illustrate this point, we use large-scale multi-material printing to examine the scaling of the elastic modulus of 2D carbon allotropes at the macroscale and validate our printed model using experimental testing. The resulting hand-held materials can be examined more readily, and yield insights beyond those available in the original digital representations.

{"title": "Regenerative Medicine for Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases.", "abstract": "The balance between bone resorption and bone formation is vital for maintenance and regeneration of alveolar bone and supporting structures around teeth and dental implants. Tissue regeneration in the oral cavity is regulated by multiple cell types, signaling mechanisms, and matrix interactions. A goal for periodontal tissue engineering/regenerative medicine is to restore oral soft and hard tissues through cell, scaffold, and/or signaling approaches to functional and aesthetic oral tissues. Bony defects in the oral cavity can vary significantly, ranging from smaller intrabony lesions resulting from periodontal or peri-implant diseases to large osseous defects that extend through the jaws as a result of trauma, tumor resection, or congenital defects. The disparity in size and location of these alveolar defects is compounded further by patient-specific and environmental factors that contribute to the challenges in periodontal regeneration, peri-implant tissue regeneration, and alveolar ridge reconstruction. Efforts have been made over the last few decades to produce reliable and predictable methods to stimulate bone regeneration in alveolar bone defects. Tissue engineering/regenerative medicine provide new avenues to enhance tissue regeneration by introducing bioactive models or constructing patient-specific substitutes.

{"title": "Interobserver variability in physician-modified endograft planning by comparison with a three-dimensional printed aortic model.", "abstract": "With the increasing application of fenestrated and physician-modified endografting for aneurysm repair, there is increasing concern about the accuracy of vessel position measurements based on computed tomography scans. Inaccuracies in measurements may result in a \"window-shutter\" or \"eclipsing\" phenomenon whereby the fenestration may not overlie the vessel ostium completely. We hypothesized that vessel position measurements from reconstructed imaging do not represent the true vessel position as obtained from a three-dimensional (3D) printed physical model of the visceral aortic segment.\nMedical 3D modeling software was used to develop the 3D reconstructions, which were then exported to the 3D printing software. This allowed 3D models to be physically generated. The distances to the top and bottom and the angle of each of the celiac, superior mesenteric, right renal, and left renal arteries were recorded. These same measurements were obtained by each of the blinded reviewers in addition to the aortic diameter at the midpoint of each of these vessels. Measurements were compared with intraclass correlation coefficient, nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test, and one-sample t-test to assess accuracy and precision. Statistical significance was set at P\u00a0< .05 for all tests.\nBoth the individual measurements and the average of the measurements were statistically accurate (significant) for the bottom of the superior mesenteric artery and the top and bottom of both the right and left renal arteries. There was variability and inaccuracy in all visceral vessel angles and in the bottom of the celiac artery (the top and the angle of the celiac artery were the arbitrary referents).\nWhereas the visceral vessel orifices are largely accurately assessed and measured, the vessel angles are not. This may lead to an eclipsing phenomenon, which may contribute to branch or fenestrated vessel failure and therefore reintervention.

{"title": "Analyzing Biological Performance of 3D-Printed, Cell-Impregnated Hybrid Constructs for Cartilage Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of hybrid constructs is a promising biofabrication method for cartilage tissue engineering because a synthetic polymer framework and cell-impregnated hydrogel provide structural and biological features of cartilage, respectively. During bioprinting, impregnated cells may be subjected to high temperatures (caused by the adjacent melted polymer) and process-induced mechanical forces, potentially compromising cell function. This study addresses these biofabrication issues, evaluating the heat distribution of printed polycaprolactone (PCL) strands and the rheological property and structural stability of alginate hydrogels at various temperatures and concentrations. The biocompatibility of parameters from these studies was tested by culturing 3D hybrid constructs bioprinted with primary cells from embryonic chick cartilage. During initial two-dimensional culture expansion of these primary cells, two morphologically and molecularly distinct cell populations (\"rounded\" and \"fibroblastic\") were isolated. The biological performance of each population was evaluated in 3D hybrid constructs separately. The cell viability, proliferation, and cartilage differentiation were observed at high levels in hybrid constructs of both cell populations, confirming the validity of these 3D bioprinting parameters for effective cartilage tissue engineering. Statistically significant performance variations were observed, however, between the rounded and fibroblastic cell populations. Molecular and morphological data support the notion that such performance differences may be attributed to the relative differentiation state of rounded versus fibroblastic cells (i.e., differentiated chondrocytes vs. chondroprogenitors, respectively), which is a relevant issue for cell-based tissue engineering strategies.

We first generated controlled mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) aggregates using a bioprinting technique to monitor their aggregation and sprouting. We induced the angiogenic potential of the MSCs through chemical inhibition of the Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway, which led to hairy sprouting in the aggregates.

Bone healing was more advanced at the porous implant surface (vs. the solid implant surface) based on the interfacial tissue \u03bd1 CO3(2-)/\u03bd2 PO4(3-) ratio, phenylalanine and tyrosine levels approaching those of the native bone. The mechanosensing infrastructure in bone, the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network, retained \u223c40% more canaliculi per osteocyte lacuna, i.e., a 'less aged' morphology at the interface. The osteocyte density per mineralised surface area was \u223c36-71% higher at the interface after extended healing periods.\nIn osseointegration research, the success of an implant surface or design is commonly determined by quantifying the amount of new bone, rather than its maturation, composition and structure. This work describes a novel correlative methodology to investigate the ultrastructure and composition of bone formed around and within 3D printed Ti6Al4V implants having an interconnected open-pore structure. Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the molecular composition of the interfacial tissue at different implant surfaces may vary, suggesting differences in the extent to which bone maturation occurs even after long-term healing. Bone maturation corresponded well with the structural parameters associated with remodelling kinetics, for example, the osteocyte density and the average number of canaliculi per osteocyte lacuna.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-11-19", "authors": ["Furqan AShah", "AndersSnis", "AleksandarMatic", "PeterThomsen", "AndersPalmquist"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.013"}
{"title": "The feasibility of producing patient-specific acrylic cranioplasty implants with a low-cost 3D printer.", "abstract": "OBJECT Commercially available, preformed patient-specific cranioplasty implants are anatomically accurate but costly. Acrylic bone cement is a commonly used alternative. However, the manual shaping of the bone cement is difficult and may not lead to a satisfactory implant in some cases. The object of this study was to determine the feasibility of fabricating molds using a commercial low-cost 3D printer for the purpose of producing patient-specific acrylic cranioplasty implants. METHODS Using data from a high-resolution brain CT scan of a patient with a calvarial defect posthemicraniectomy, a skull phantom and a mold were generated with computer software and fabricated with the 3D printer using the fused deposition modeling method. The mold was used as a template to shape the acrylic implant, which was formed via a polymerization reaction. The resulting implant was fitted to the skull phantom and the cranial index of symmetry was determined. RESULTS The skull phantom and mold were successfully fabricated with the 3D printer. The application of acrylic bone cement to the mold was simple and straightforward. The resulting implant did not require further adjustment or drilling prior to being fitted to the skull phantom. The cranial index of symmetry was 96.2% (the cranial index of symmetry is 100% for a perfectly symmetrical skull). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that it is feasible to produce patient-specific acrylic cranioplasty implants with a low-cost 3D printer. Further studies are required to determine applicability in the clinical setting.

The PCL scaffolds were surface coated with calcium phosphate (CaP) to enable further comparison of the osteoinductive potential of different scaffolds: PCL (control), PCL/CaP-coated, PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG scaffolds. The PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG composite scaffolds were reproducibly manufactured with a morphology highly resembling that of PCL only scaffolds. However, 50wt% loading of the bioactive glass (BG) particles into the PCL bulk decreased the scaffold's compressive Young's modulus. Coating of PCL scaffolds with CaP had a negligible effect on the scaffold's porosity and compressive Young's modulus. When immersed in culture media, BG dissolution ions (Si and Sr) were detected for up to 10weeks in the immersion media and surface precipitates were formed on both PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG scaffolds' surfaces, indicating good in vitro bioactivity. In vitro cell studies were conducted using sheep bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) under non-osteogenic or osteogenic conditioned media, and under static or dynamic culture environments. All scaffolds were able to support cell adhesion, growth and proliferation. However, when cultured in non-osteogenic media, only PCL/CaP, PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG scaffolds showed an up-regulation of osteogenic gene expression. Additionally, under a dynamic culture environment, the rate of cell growth, proliferation and osteoblast-related gene expression was enhanced across all scaffold groups. Subsequently, PCL/CaP, PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG scaffolds, with or without seeded cells, were implanted subcutaneously into nude rats for the evaluation of osteoinductivity potential. After 8 and 16weeks, host tissue infiltrated well into the scaffolds, but no mature bone formation was observed in any scaffolds groups.\nThis novelty of this research work is that it provide a comprehensive comparison, both in vitro and in vivo, between 3 different composite materials widely used in the field of bone tissue engineering for their bone regeneration capabilities.

One strategy proposed to reverse this trend consists of early exposure of medical students to the field. Against this backdrop, the present study presents an innovative approach for anatomy teaching, integrating a surgically relevant trend: 3D printing.\nWhole-body computed tomography (CT) was made of two cadavers. Twelve students performed measurements and 3D reconstructions of selected anatomical structures (Osirix, Mimics). 3D printed (3DP) models were obtained (ZPrinter 310 Plus), and the students completed the analogous measurements on these replicas. Finally, classical anatomical dissection was performed and the same parameters were measured. The differences between the values obtained by the three modalities were submitted to standard statistical analysis (Wilcoxon two-tail paired test).\nQualitative comparison of the digital 3D reconstructions based on the students' manual CT segmentation and the anatomical reality showed excellent correlation. Quantitatively, the values measured on the CT images and the physical models created by 3D printing differed from those measured on the cadavers by less than 2\u00a0mm. Students were highly appreciative of the approach (CT, 3DP, cadaver). Their average satisfaction score was 5.8 on a 1-6 scale.\nThis study shows that the approach proposed can be achieved.

The goal was to select an EVA grade with optimal properties, namely vinyl acetate content, melting index, flexural modulus, for 3D printing of implantable prototypes with the drug incorporated within the entire matrix of the medical devices. Indomethacin was used as a model drug in this study. Out of the twelve tested grades of the EVA five were printable. One of them showed superior print quality and was further investigated by printing drug-loaded filaments, containing 5% and 15% indomethacin. The feedstock filaments were fabricated by hot-melt extrusion (HME) below the melting point of the drug substance and the IUS and SR were successfully printed at the temperature above the melting point of the drug. As a result, the drug substance in the printed prototypes showed to be at least partly amorphous, while the drug in the corresponding HME filaments was crystalline. This difference affected the drug release profiles from the filaments and printed prototype products: faster release from the prototypes over 30days in the in vitro tests.

While factors controlling their mechanical and biological response have recently been the subject of intense research, the interplay between mechanical properties, bone ingrowth requirements, and manufacturing constraints, is still unclear. In this paper, we present two high-strength stretch-dominated topologies, the Tetrahedron and the Octet truss, as well as an intuitive visualization method to understand the relationship of cell topology, pore size, porosity with constraints imposed by bone ingrowth requirements and additive manufacturing. 40 samples of selected porosities are fabricated using Selective Laser Melting (SLM), and their morphological deviations resulting from SLM are assessed via micro-CT. Mechanical compression testing is used to obtain stiffness and strength properties, whereas bone ingrowth is assessed in a canine in vivo model at four and eight weeks. The results show that the maximum strength and stiffness ranged from 227.86\u00b110.15 to 31.37\u00b12.19MPa and 4.58\u00b10.18 to 1.23\u00b10.40GPa respectively, and the maximum 0.2% offset strength is almost 5 times stronger than that of tantalum foam.

A study was performed to assess their effectiveness against cadaveric materials for learning external cardiac anatomy. A double blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken on undergraduate medical students without prior formal cardiac anatomy teaching. Following a pre-test examining baseline external cardiac anatomy knowledge, participants were randomly assigned to three groups who underwent self-directed learning sessions using either cadaveric materials, 3D prints, or a combination of cadaveric materials/3D prints (combined materials). Participants were then subjected to a post-test written by a third party. Fifty-two participants completed the trial; 18 using cadaveric materials, 16 using 3D models, and 18 using combined materials. Age and time since completion of high school were equally distributed between groups. Pre-test scores were not significantly different (P\u2009=\u20090.231), however, post-test scores were significantly higher for 3D prints group compared to the cadaveric materials or combined materials groups (mean of 60.83% vs. 44.81% and 44.62%, P\u2009=\u20090.010, adjusted P\u2009=\u20090.012).

The precipitation of \u03b2 phase and the gradual transformation of \u03b1' into \u03b1 phase by the diffusion of excess vanadium from \u03b1' to \u03b2 phase are proposed to be the main events of martensite \u03b1' phase decomposition in parts fabricated by selective laser melting.

{"title": "Versatile 3D-printed headstage implant for group housing of rodents.", "abstract": "An unfavourable yet necessary side-effect of stereotaxic surgery involves the social isolation of post-surgery rats, in order to protect their wound site or skull-mounted implant from damage. Social isolation can cause a myriad of behavioural and physiological changes that are detrimental to the well-being of rats, with potential negative implications for a range of experimental paradigms. New method. Female Sprague Dawley rats (n=40) were implanted onto the skull with a novel 3D-printed headstage socket that surrounded an electrode connector. The socket accommodated a removable stainless-steel headcap for the purposes of protecting the implant. Rats were pair-housed following surgery, and their behaviour was monitored for up to several weeks under two experimental conditions that involved EEG recording and deep-brain stimulation, as well as behavioural test sessions inside an open-field maze. Rat weights were compared between individually- and pair-housed rats at up to 3 weeks post-surgery.\nThese experiments were successfully carried out using pair-housed rats, with no damage or complications observed regarding the implant and its headcap. Rats were able to carry out a range of normal behaviours including running, grooming, foraging and sleeping. Compared to individually-housed rats, pair-housed rats gained less weight over the 3 weeks post-implantation period. Comparison with existing method(s). This method offers additional protection compared to group-housed post-surgical rats that lack the protective headcap. It is also potentially more practical and versatile than a fully-implantable device for the safe post-surgery group housing of rodents.\nThis implant design can reduce the cost of rodent upkeep, whilst potentially avoiding a myriad of behavioural and physiological changes that are known to result from social isolation.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "date": "2015-10-13", "authors": ["R CPinnell", "R KAlmajidy", "U GHofmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.09.027"}

Modern angiographic equipment offers various two-dimensional (2D) and 3D measurement methods that have not been systematically evaluated for accuracy and reliability.\nTo evaluate these methods using anthropomorphic vessel phantoms.\nTubing of known sizes (2-5\u2005mm, 1\u2005mm increments) was embedded in 3D-printed skulls to simulate the middle cerebral artery, internal carotid artery, and basilar artery. Each phantom was imaged to gain 3D DSA, 2D DSA, and DynaCT images. Three identical measurement locations were identified on each simulated vessel. Eight measurement methods (four 2D, three 3D, and one DynaCT) were evaluated. Measurements were performed by three independent experienced users on three separate occasions. Intraclass correlation and independent non-parametric analysis were carried out to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of these measurement methods.\nBetter reliability was noted for the automatic measurement methods than for the corresponding manual measurement methods. The mean differences with the ground truth for all methods ranged from -0.12 to 0.03 with small SEs (0.02-0.03) and SDs (0.10-0.18). The smallest absolute mean differences were achieved in two automatic measurement methods based on 2D manual calibration and 3D images. In comparison with these two methods, results of measurements based on 2D autocalibration were statistically different.\nIn our study, automatic analysis using 3D or 2D was the preferred measurement method.

{"title": "Topological design of all-ceramic dental bridges for enhancing fracture resistance.", "abstract": "Layered all-ceramic systems have been increasingly adopted in major dental prostheses. However, ceramics are inherently brittle, and they often subject to premature failure under high occlusion forces especially in the posterior region. This study aimed to develop mechanically sound novel topological designs for all-ceramic dental bridges by minimizing the fracture incidence under given loading conditions. A bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique is implemented within the extended finite element method (XFEM) framework. Extended finite element method allows modeling crack initiation and propagation inside all-ceramic restoration systems. Following this, BESO searches the optimum distribution of two different ceramic materials, namely porcelain and zirconia, for minimizing fracture incidence. A performance index, as per a ratio of peak tensile stress to material strength, is used as a design objective. In this study, the novel XFEM based BESO topology optimization significantly improved structural strength by minimizing performance index for suppressing fracture incidence in the structures. As expected, the fracture resistance and factor of safety of fixed partial dentures structure increased upon redistributing zirconia and porcelain in the optimal topological configuration. Dental CAD/CAM systems and the emerging 3D printing technology were commercially available to facilitate implementation of such a computational design, exhibiting considerable potential for clinical application in the future.

Various synthetic and natural hydrogels with key characteristics, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, printability and crosslinkability, have been employed as ink materials in bioprinting. Choosing the right cell-containing \"bioink\" material is the most essential step for fabricating 3-D constructs with a controlled mechanical and biochemical microenvironment that can lead to successful tissue regeneration and repair. Here, we demonstrate that the genetically engineered M13 phage holds great potential for use as a versatile nanoink for printing 3-D cell-laden matrices. In particular, M13 phages displaying integrin-binding (GRGDS) and calcium-binding (DDYD) domains on their surface were blended with alginate to successfully form Ca(2+)-crosslinked hydrogels. Furthermore, 3-D cell-laden scaffolds with high cell viability were generated after optimizing the printing process. The MC3T3-E1 cells within these scaffolds showed enhanced proliferation and differentiation rates that increased proportionally with the concentration of phages in the 3-D matrices compared with the rates of cells in pure alginate scaffolds.\nBioprinting is an emerging technology for producing tissue-mimetic 3-D structures using cell-containing hydrogels called bioink.

A key requirement for the clinical success of the bioactive ceramics is the match of the mechanical behavior of the implants with the specific bone tissue to be filled. This raises the question as to what design strategy might be the best indicators for the balance between mechanical properties and biological performances. Here we go beyond the traditional approaches that use phase conversion or biphasic hybrid; instead, we achieved a simultaneous enhancement of several mechanical parameters and optimalization of biodegradability by using a dilute doping of Mg in a single-phase wollastonite bioceramic. We show that the wollastonite ceramic can be rationally tuned in phase (\u03b1 or \u03b2), mechanical strength (in compression and bending mode), elastic modulus (18-23GPa), and fracture toughness (>3.2MPam(1/2)) through the usage of Mg dopant introduced at precisely defined dilute concentrations (Mg/Ca molar ratio: 1.2-2.1%). Meanwhile, the dilute Mg-doped wollastonite ceramics are shown to exhibit good bioactivity in vitro in SBF but biodegradation in Tris is inversely proportional to Mg content. Consequently, such new highly bioactive ceramics with appreciable strength and toughness are promising for making specific porous scaffolds for enhancing large segmental bone defect and thin-wall bone defect repair.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-10-02", "authors": ["JiajunXie", "XianyanYang", "HuifengShao", "JuanYe", "YongHe", "JianzhongFu", "ChangyouGao", "ZhongruGou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.09.012"}

Micro-architectures of such biomaterials determine their physical and biological properties, meaning that one could potentially improve the performance of such biomaterials through rational design of micro-architecture. The relationship between the micro-architecture of porous biomaterials and their physical and biological properties has therefore received increasing attention recently. In this paper, we studied the mechanical properties of porous biomaterials made from a relatively unexplored unit cell, namely rhombicuboctahedron. We derived analytical relationships that relate the micro-architecture of such porous biomaterials, i.e. the dimensions of the rhombicuboctahedron unit cell, to their elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and yield stress. Finite element models were also developed to validate the analytical solutions. Analytical and numerical results were compared with experimental data from one of our recent studies. It was found that analytical solutions and numerical results show a very good agreement particularly for smaller values of apparent density. The elastic moduli predicted by analytical and numerical models were in very good agreement with experimental observations too. While in excellent agreement with each other, analytical and numerical models somewhat over-predicted the yield stress of the porous structures as compared to experimental data. As the ratio of the vertical struts to the inclined struts, \u03b1, approaches zero and infinity, the rhombicuboctahedron unit cell respectively approaches the octahedron (or truncated cube) and cube unit cells. For those limits, the analytical solutions presented here were found to approach the analytic solutions obtained for the octahedron, truncated cube, and cube unit cells, meaning that the presented solutions are generalizations of the analytical solutions obtained for several other types of porous biomaterials.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-09-08", "authors": ["RHedayati", "MSadighi", "MMohammadi-Aghdam", "A AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.07.013"}

A customized artificial vertebral body fabricated according to a computer model using titanium alloy powder was inserted to replace the defect between C1 and C3. The microstructure of the implant was optimized for better biomechanical stability and enhanced bone healing.\nPatient had an uneventful recovery and began to ambulate on postoperative day 7. Adjuvant treatment commenced 3 weeks after the surgery. He was tumor-free at the 1-year follow-up. Computed tomography studies revealed evidence of implant osseointegration and no subsidence or displacement of the construct.\nThis is a case example on the concept of personalized precision medicine in a surgical setting and demonstrates how 3D-printed, patient-specific implants may bring individualized solutions to rare problems wherein restoration of the specific anatomy of each patient is a key prognostic factor.", "journal": "Spine", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["NanfangXu", "FengWei", "XiaoguangLiu", "LiangJiang", "HongCai", "ZiheLi", "MiaoYu", "FengliangWu", "ZhongjunLiu"], "doi": "10.1097/BRS.0000000000001179"}

Part II: Microscale modeling approach and validation.", "abstract": "The authors have previously reported a rigorous macroscale modeling approach for an in vitro 3D dynamic microorgan device (DMD). This paper represents the second of a two-part model-based investigation where the effect of microscale (single liver cell-level) shear-mediated mechanotransduction on drug biotransformation is deconstructed. Herein, each cell is explicitly incorporated into the geometric model as single compartmentalized metabolic structures. Each cell's metabolic activity is coupled with the microscale hydrodynamic Wall Shear Stress (WSS) simulated around the cell boundary through a semi-empirical polynomial function as an additional reaction term in the mass transfer equations. Guided by the macroscale model-based hydrodynamics, only 9 cells in 3 representative DMD domains are explicitly modeled. Dynamic and reaction similarity rules based on non-dimensionalization are invoked to correlate the numerical and empirical models, accounting for the substrate time scales. The proposed modeling approach addresses the key challenge of computational cost towards modeling complex large-scale DMD-type system with prohibitively high cell densities. Transient simulations are implemented to extract the drug metabolite profile with the microscale modeling approach validated with an experimental drug flow study.

This paper represents the first of a two-part model-based investigation of a 3D dynamic microorgan device (DMD). The prescribed tissue model in this paper is precisely embedded within a DMD by 3D bioprinting hydrogel encapsulated liver cells into a patterned array of microchannels. A perfusing drug substrate is biotransformed by liver cells encapsulated within porous hydrogel walls. Therefore, the free and porous flow regime equations are first solved in tandem to derive the laminar velocity profile and wall shear stresses in the entire shear-mediated flow regime. These equations are then coupled with a convection-diffusion equation and Michaelis-Menten reaction terms, resulting in an effective convection-diffusion-cell kinetics model. A key consideration addressed herein is mechanotransduction where shear stresses on the encapsulated cells alter subcellular liver enzyme reaction rates. Cells are incorporated into the geometric model implicitly (macroscale) as enzyme reaction structures uniformly distributed throughout the DMD length.

Longitudinal observation of bone reaction at the implant site (BV/TV) as well as resorption of the implanted pins were monitored using in vivo micro-focus computed tomography (\u00b5CT). After 12, 24 and 36 weeks femora containing the implants were explanted, scanned with high resolution ex vivo \u00b5CT, and the surface roughness of the implants was measured to conclude on the ingrowth capability for bone tissue. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to observe changes on the surface of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) during degradation and cell ingrowth. Four different composites with zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and Herafill(\u00ae) were compared. After 36 weeks in vivo, none of the implants did show significant degradation. The PHB composite with ZrO2 and a high percentage (30%) of Herafill\u00ae as well as the Mg-alloy WZ21 showed the highest values of bone accumulation (increased BV/TV) around the implant. The lowest value was measured in PHB with 3% ZrO2 containing no Herafill\u00ae. Roughness measurements as well as EDX and SEM imaging could not reveal any changes on the PHB composites\u05f3 surfaces. Biomechanical parameters, such as the adhesion strength between bone and implant were determined by measuring the shear strength as well as push-out energy of the bone-implant interface. The results showed that improvement of these mechanical properties of the studied PHBs P3Z, P3Z10H and P3Z30H is necessary in order to obtain appropriate load-bearing material. The moduli of elasticity, tensile strength and strain properties of the PHB composites are close to that of bone and thus promising. Compared to clinically used PLGA, PGA and PLA materials, their additional benefit is an unchanged local pH value during degradation, which makes them well tolerated by cells and immune system.

A hollow aneurysm model with connectors for silicone tubes was fabricated by using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Support material was dissolved, and surfaces were finished by using NanoSeal.

{"title": "Mechanical Modeling of the Human Cricoid Cartilage Using Computer-Aided Design: Applications in Airway Balloon Dilation Research.", "abstract": "Balloon dilation is generally considered first-line treatment for airway stenosis. Some dilation systems utilize a compliant balloon that can conform around rigid structures. Others use a noncompliant balloon that does not conform, allowing for dilation of more rigid stenoses. We hypothesized that subglottic dilation with a noncompliant balloon increases the likelihood of fracture of the cricoid when compared to a compliant balloon.\nThree fresh human cricoid cartilages were placed in a universal testing system to determine the expansile force necessary for cricoid fracture. Using these data, a 3D printer was used to construct a synthetic cricoid model possessing near identical physical characteristics to the human cricoid. Simulated dilation was then performed on the model using a compliant and a noncompliant balloon.\nHuman cricoid fracture occurred at 97.25 N (SD = 8.34), and the synthetic cricoid model fractured at 100.10 N (SD = 7.32). Both balloons fractured the model in every replicate experiment. Mean balloon internal pressure at fracture was 7.67 ATM (SD = 1.21) for the compliant balloon and 11.34 ATM (SD = 1.29) for the noncompliant balloon.\nThese data show that fracture of the cricoid is a valid concern in balloon dilation procedures where the balloon spans the subglottis.

We also sought to correlate measurements from the source cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image dataset and the 3D model. Complicated ventriculo-arterial relationships in patients with complex conotruncal malformations make preoperative assessment of possible repair pathways difficult. Patients were chosen with double outlet right ventricle for the complexity of intracardiac anatomy and potential for better delineation of anatomic spatial relationships. Virtual 3D models were generated from CMR 3D datasets. Measurements were made on the source CMR as well as the 3D model for the following structures: aortic diameter in orthogonal planes, VSD diameter in orthogonal planes and long axis of right ventricle. A total of six patients were identified for inclusion. The path from the ventricles to each respective outflow tract and the location of the VSD with respect to each great vessel was visualized clearly in all patients. Measurements on the virtual model showed excellent correlation with the source CMR when all measurements were included by Pearson coefficient, r\u00a0=\u00a00.99 as well as for each individual structure.

In this study we consider the effects of tensile force on osteoclastogenesis in human monocytes. The cells were treated with receptor activator of nuclear factor\u00a0\u03baB ligand (RANKL) to promote osteoclastogenesis. Then,expression and secretion of cathepsin K were examined. RANKL and the formation of osteoclasts during the osteoclast differentiation process under continual tensile stress were evaluated by Western blot. It was also found that -100\u00a0kPa or lower induces RANKL-enhanced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, an increased tensile force raises the expression and secretion of cathepsin K elevated by RANKL, and is concurrent with the increase of TNF-receptor-associated factor\u00a06 induction and nuclear factor \u03baB activation. Overall, the current report demonstrates that tensile force reinforces RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by retarding osteoclast differentiation. The tensile force is able to modify every cell through dose-dependent in vitro RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, affecting the fusion of preosteoclasts and function of osteoclasts. However, tensile force increased TNF-receptor-associated factor\u00a06 expression. These results are in vitro findings and were obtained under a condition of tensile force.

However, a new teaching construct has appeared recently in which artificial cadavers are manufactured through three-dimensional (3D) printing of patient specific radiological data sets. In this article, a simple powder based printer is made more versatile to manufacture hard bones, silicone muscles and perfusable blood vessels. The approach involves blending modern approaches (3D printing) with more ancient ones (casting and lost-wax techniques). These anatomically accurate models can augment the approach to anatomy teaching from dissection to synthesis of 3D-printed parts held together with embedded rare earth magnets. Vascular simulation is possible through application of pumps and artificial blood. The resulting arteries and veins can be cannulated and imaged with Doppler ultrasound. In some respects, 3D-printed anatomy is superior to older teaching methods because the parts are cheap, scalable, they can cover the entire age span, they can be both dissected and reassembled and the data files can be printed anywhere in the world and mass produced.

Categorical data were compared using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, numerical data according to goodness of fit to the normal distribution, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05.\nSubjectively, the students liked the file size and sequence designation in the BioRace system significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) better than in the HyFlex counterpart, whilst they found better controllability with the HyFlex (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and reported no difference in cutting efficiency. They preferred both systems to the ProFile. Objectively, canal transportation was significantly less with the HyFlex (and the ProFile) systems compared to BioRace (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both systems under investigation were statistically similar in terms of file fractures (nil), length control, and instrumentation time, which was considerably faster than with the ProFile control system.\nHyFlex and BioRace had perceived and quantifiable strengths and weaknesses.

In this study, we evaluated the suitability of photo-crosslinkable methacrylated gelatin (GM) and mature adipocytes as components for the composition of three-dimensional fatty tissue constructs. Cytocompatibility evaluations of the GM and the photoinitiator Lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) showed no cytotoxicity in the relevant range of concentrations. Matrix stiffness of cell-laden hydrogels was adjusted to native fatty tissue by tuning the degree of crosslinking and was shown to be comparable to that of native fatty tissue. Mature adipocytes were then cultured for 14 days within the GM resulting in a fatty tissue construct loaded with viable cells expressing cell markers perilipin A and laminin. This work demonstrates that mature adipocytes are a highly valuable cell source for the composition of fatty tissue equivalents in\u00a0vitro. Photo-crosslinkable methacrylated gelatin is an excellent tissue scaffold and a promising bioink for new printing techniques due to its biocompatibility and tunable properties.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2015-05-29", "authors": ["BirgitHuber", "KirstenBorchers", "G\u00fcnter EmTovar", "Petra JKluger"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328215587450"}

The Robohand demonstrated that three-dimensional printing reduces the cost of a prosthetic extremity. The goal of this project was to develop a novel, inexpensive three-dimensional printed prosthesis to address limitations of the Robohand.\nThe prosthesis was designed for patients with transradial limb amputation. It is shoulder-controlled and externally powered with an anthropomorphic terminal device. The user can open and close all five fingers, and move the thumb independently. The estimated cost is US$300.\nAfter testing on a patient with a traumatic transradial amputation, several advantages were noted. The independent thumb movement facilitated object grasp, the device weighed less than most externally powered prostheses, and the size was easily scalable. Limitations of the new prosthetic include low grip strength and decreased durability compared to passive prosthetics.\nMost children with a transradial congenital or traumatic amputation do not use a prosthetic.

A second digital impression (STL2) with the provisional retained restoration in\u00a0situ was performed in two steps: the first part of the scan captured all details of the vestibular and palatal sides of the provisional retained restoration and the adjacent teeth. The provisional retained restoration was then unscrewed, and the subgingival part of the restoration was scanned directly out of the mouth to determine its subgingival shape. STL1 and STL2 were imported into imaging software and superimposed using the \"best fit\" algorithm to achieve a new merged file (STL3) with the 3D implant position, the peri-implant mucosa, and emergence profile. The merged file was used to design the CAD/CAM customized abutment and to realize a stereolithographic model by 3D printing.\nThe STL superimposition of digital impressions of the implant position and the provisional retained restoration constitute a novel technique to obtain a single STL file with the implant position and its peri-implant mucosal architecture.\nFDT is a rapid digital approach for achieving all information of the peri-implant soft tissue and emergence profile directly from the provisional retained restoration.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2015-04-25", "authors": ["CarloMonaco", "EdoardoEvangelisti", "RobertoScotti", "GiuseppeMignani", "GiovanniZucchelli"], "doi": "10.1111/clr.12599"}

The basic premise of high-density arraying has since been expanded to create cells microarrays. Cells on chip are powerful experimental tools for high-throughput and multiplex screening of samples or cellular functions. Miniaturization increases assay throughput while reducing both reagent consumption and cell population heterogeneity effect, making these systems attractive for a wide range of assays, from drug discovery to toxicology, stem cell research and therapy. One form of cell microarrays, the transfected cell microarray, wherein plasmid DNA or siRNA, spotted on the surface of a substrate, is reverse-transfected locally into adherent cells, has become a standard tool for parallel cell-based analysis. With the advent of technologies, cells can also be directly spotted onto functionalized surfaces using robotic fluid-dispensing devices, or printed directly in bio-ink material.

From these, polylactic acid and MakerBot Flexible Filament replicas of each aneurysm were created by means of fused deposition modeling. The accuracy of the replicas was assessed by quantifying statistical significance in the variations of their inner dimensions relative to 3D DSA images. Feasibility for using these replicas as flow phantoms in combination with phase contrast MRI was demonstrated.\n3D printed aneurysm models were created for all 10 subjects. Good agreement was seen between the models and the source anatomy. Aneurysm diameter measurements of the printed models and source images correlated well (r=0.999; p<0.001), with no statistically significant group difference (p=0.4) or observed bias. The SDs of the measurements were 0.5\u2005mm and 0.2\u2005mm for source images and 3D models, respectively. 3D printed models could be imaged with flow via MRI.\nThe 3D printed aneurysm models presented were accurate and were able to be produced inhouse.

CT data were sent for post-processing and output to the 3D printer to create kidney models with tumor. By presenting to experienced laparoscopic urologists and patients, respectively, the models' realism, effectiveness for surgical planning and training, and patients' comprehension of disease and procedure were evaluated with plotted questionnaires (10-point rating scales, 1-not at all useful/not at all realistic/poor, 10-very useful/very realistic/excellent). The size of resected tumors was compared with that on the models.\nTen kidney models of such patients were fabricated successfully. The overall effectiveness in surgical planning and training (7.8 \u00b1 0.7-8.0 \u00b1 1.1), and realism (6.0 \u00b1 0.6-7.8 \u00b1 1.0) were reached by four invited urologists.

With recent advances in three-dimensional computer-aided designs and additive manufacturing technology, various PST designs have been reported, although the template designs were not optimized. We have developed a novel PST design that reduces the contact area without sacrificing stability. It avoids susceptibility to intervening soft tissue, template geometric inaccuracy, and difficulty during template fitting.\nFourteen candidate locations on the posterior aspect of the vertebra were evaluated. Among them, locations that had high reproducibility on computed tomography (CT) images and facilitated accurate PS placement were selected for the final PST design. An additive manufacturing machine (EOSINT M270) fabricated the PSTs using commercially pure titanium powder. For the clinical study, 36 scoliosis patients and 4 patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) were treated with thoracic PSs using our newly developed PSTs. We intraoperatively and postoperatively evaluated the accuracy of the PS hole created by the PST.\nBased on the segmentation reproducibility and stability analyses, we selected seven small, round contact points for our PST: bilateral superior and inferior points on the transverse process base, bilateral inferior points on the laminar, and a superior point on the spinous process. Clinically, the success rates of PS placement using this PST design were 98.6\u00a0% (414/420) for scoliosis patients and 100\u00a0% (46/46) for OPLL patients.\nThis study provides a useful design concept for the development and introduction of patient-specific navigational templates for placing PSs.", "journal": "European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society", "date": "2015-03-31", "authors": ["MitsuruTakemoto", "ShunsukeFujibayashi", "EigoOta", "BungoOtsuki", "HiroakiKimura", "TakeshiSakamoto", "ToshiyukiKawai", "TohruFutami", "KiyoyukiSasaki", "TomiharuMatsushita", "TakashiNakamura", "MasashiNeo", "ShuichMatsuda"], "doi": "10.1007/s00586-015-3908-z"}

Though a number of phantoms have been conceived, certain applications may warrant highly customized geometries. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the expediency of rapid prototyping for generating a flexible class of MR-compatible phantom designs.\nAn incarnation of the three-dimensional Shepp-Logan numerical phantom, amended for use in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, was actualized using rapid prototyping. Each of the comprising compartments was filled with a solution containing prepared concentrations of common (1)H brain metabolites. Analytical Fourier expressions for the phantom class were established in order to generate a set of simulated measurements, which were then contrasted with acquired data.\nExperimental results for both structural and spectroscopic imaging substantiate the suitability of rapid prototyping for MR phantom applications. The analytically simulated measurements show excellent agreement with the measured data, but also highlight the various consequences effectuated when certain aspects of the acquisition model are disregarded or misrepresented.\nRapid prototyping offers a novel and versatile framework for MR phantom-based validation studies.

Bioprinting offers not only automated standardizable processes but also the production of complex tissue-like structures in an additive manner. We developed an all-in-one bioprinting solution to produce soft tissue models. The holistic approach included (1) a bioprinter in a sterile environment, (2) a light-induced bioink polymerization unit, (3) a user-friendly software, (4) the capability to print in standard labware for high-throughput screening, (5) cell-compatible inkjet-based printheads, (6) a cell-compatible ready-to-use BioInk, and (7) standard operating procedures.

To produce dermal equivalents, primary human dermal fibroblasts were printed in alternating layers with BioInk and cultured for up to 7 weeks. During long-term cultures, the models were remodeled and fully populated with viable and spreaded fibroblasts. Primary human dermal keratinocytes were seeded on top of dermal equivalents, and epidermis-like structures were formed as verified with hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunostaining.
