We focus on the hemodynamics, modeling of the valves, cardiac tissue mechanics, and on the simulation of medical devices and treatments. For every topic, we provide an overview of the methods employed to solve the specific numerical issue entailed by the simulation. We try to cover the complete process, starting from the creation of the geometrical model up to the analysis and post-processing, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the methodology.",

{"title": "Phytoformulation with hydroxycitric acid and capsaicin protects against high-fat-diet-induced obesity cardiomyopathy by reducing cardiac lipid deposition and ameliorating inflammation and apoptosis in the heart.", "abstract": "Phytoformulation therapy is a pioneering strategy for the treatment of metabolic disorders and related diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of a phytoformulation consisting of hydroxycitric acid and capsaicin against obesity-related cardiomyopathy.\nSprague-Dawley rats were fed HFD for 21 weeks, and phytoformulation (100\u00a0mg/kg body weight) was administered orally for 45 days starting at week 16.\nWe found that HFD supplementation resulted in significant hyperglycemia and caused an increase in cardiac lipid deposition, inflammation and apoptosis in the heart. Phytoformulation therapy not only significantly decreased blood levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and inflammatory cytokines in obese rats, but also protected cardiac tissue, as shown by histological analysis. Conversely, phytoformulation therapy decreased mRNA levels for sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid binding protein 1 genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and absorption in obese rats. It increased the levels of lysosomal acid lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, and lipoprotein lipase genes involved in fatty acid degradation in the heart. In addition, the phytoformulation improved cardiac inflammation and apoptosis by downregulating the genes nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin-6, toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), BCL2-associated X and caspase-3. In conclusion, our results show that the phytoformulation improved insulin sensitivity and attenuated myocardial lipid accumulation, inflammation, and apoptosis in the heart of HFD-induced obese rats by regulating fatty acid metabolism genes and downregulating NF-kB/TLR-4/caspase-3.", "journal": "Journal of traditional and complementary medicine", "date": "2024-03-14", "authors": ["V V SathibabuUddandrao", "PChandrasekaran", "GSaravanan", "ParimBrahmanaidu", "SSengottuvelu", "PPonmurugan", "SVadivukkarasi", "UmeshKumar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtcme.2023.08.004\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000973\n10.1161/circulationaha.119.043319\n10.1038/s41401-022-00885-8\n10.1152/physrev.00030.2020\n10.1111/joim.12728\n10.1016/j.taap.2017.11.003\n10.1080/13510002.2020.1763714\n10.1186/s13287-020-01643-5\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00431\n10.1186/s12944-018-0905-3\n10.3390/toxins14120833\n10.1007/s12012-017-9430-2\n10.3390/molecules26113278\n10.1080/13813455.2020.1811731\n10.1007/s11010-017-3199-2\n10.1016/j.mce.2015.10.007\n10.1039/c9ra01345h\n10.1021/acsomega.2c02838\n10.3892/etm.2019.7513\n10.1042/BSR20170286\n10.3831/KPI.2022.25.2.79\n10.3389/fnut.2022.828522\n10.1080/13813455.2018.1555668\n10.1186/s12986-017-0228-9\n10.1056/NEJMoa1808721\n10.3390/cells10030629\n10.1007/s10741-018-9749-1\n10.1111/jfbc.13450\n10.1155/2022/5741198\n10.1007/s10741-013-9387-6\n10.1080/13813455.2021.1874017\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311371\n10.2174/1871524920666200207101920\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000001167\n10.1007/s00580-019-02955-6\n10.2174/1871525718666200206114304\n10.1186/s12944-019-1171-8\n10.1155/2022/3159717\n10.1177/2047487318819019\n10.3390/cells10113259\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.03.020\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.165579\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.12.013\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy903\n10.1038/s41419-018-1135-3\n10.1093/cvr/cvx012\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa217\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.742178\n10.1371/journal.pone.0216610\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.10.445\n10.3389/fphys.2021.746494\n10.1038/s41598-020-75301-4\n10.1016/j.numecd.2011.11.002\n10.1007/s12012-016-9370-2"}

The 3D multicellular tissue was incorporated with extracellular matrix sheets and surgically implanted into the right ventricle of a healthy porcine model (n = 4). After 60 days, the implanted patches were evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and electroanatomic mapping studies as well as by post-euthanasia analyses, including measurements of mechanical viscoelasticity.\nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed improved regional tissue perfusion in the patch area. Electroanatomic mapping exhibited regenerated electrical conductivity in the patch, as evidenced by relatively preserved voltage regions (1.11 \u00b1 0.8 mV) in comparison to the normal right ventricle (4.7 \u00b1 2.8 mV). Histologic and tissue analyses confirmed repopulation of site-specific host cells, including premature cardiomyocytes and active vasculogenesis. These findings were supported by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nThe tissue engineered cardiac patch effectively facilitated in situ constructive and functional myocardial regeneration, characterized by increased regional tissue perfusion and positive electrical activity in the porcine model.", "journal": "Annals of thoracic surgery short reports", "date": "2024-03-11", "authors": ["YojiroKoda", "TatsuyaWatanabe", "KeigoKawaji", "FeiMo", "Andrew DBeaser", "MarcellaVaicik", "NarutoshiHibino", "TakeyoshiOta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.atssr.2023.11.014"}

These are often characterised by abnormal electrical conduction, which may cause locally disorganised propagation wavefronts. To quantify it, a novel heterogeneity parameter based on vector field analysis is proposed, utilising finite differences to measure direction changes between adjacent cliques. The proposed Vector Field Heterogeneity metric has been evaluated on a set of simulations with controlled levels of organisation in vector maps, and a variety of grid sizes. Furthermore, it has been tested on animal experimental models of isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The proposed parameter exhibited superior capturing ability of heterogeneous propagation wavefronts compared to the classical Spatial Inhomogeneity Index, and simulations proved that the metric effectively captures gradual increments in disorganisation in propagation patterns.

{"title": "Effects of electrospun fibers containing ascorbic acid on oxidative stress reduction for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering provides promise for regeneration of cardiac tissue following myocardial infarction. However, the harsh microenvironment of the infarct hampers the efficacy of regenerative therapies. Ischemia-reperfusion injury dramatically increases the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the infarcted area, causing a cascade of further cellular injury. Implantable tissue engineered grafts can target this oxidative stress by delivering pharmaceutical compounds directly into the diseased tissue. Herein, we successfully fabricated electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers containing varying concentrations of ascorbic acid, a potent antioxidant well known for its ROS-scavenging capabilities. The antioxidant scaffolds displayed significantly improved scavenging of DPPH radicals, superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals, in a dose dependent manner. Mechanical properties testing indicated that incorporation of ascorbic acid enhanced the strength and Young's modulus of the material, correlating with a moderate but non-significant increase in the crystallinity. Moreover, the scaffolds supported adhesion and maintained survival of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro, indicating good cytocompatibility. These results provide motivation for the use of ascorbic acid-containing fibrous scaffolds to regulate the highly oxidative microenvironment following myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Journal of applied polymer science", "date": "2024-03-05", "authors": ["Ella-LouiseHandley", "AnthonyCallanan"], "doi": "10.1002/app.54242"}
{"title": "Resveratrol prevents age-related heart impairment through inhibiting the Notch/NF-\u03baB pathway.", "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenol compound found in various plants that has been shown to have potential benefits for preventing aging and supporting cardiovascular health. However, the specific signal pathway by which RSV protects the aging heart is not yet well understood. This study aimed to explore the protective effects of RSV against age-related heart injury and investigate the underlying mechanisms using a D-galactose-induced aging model. The results of the study indicated that RSV provided protection against age-related heart impairment in mice. This was evidenced by the reduction of cardiac histopathological changes as well as the attenuation of apoptosis. RSV-induced cardioprotection was linked to a significant increase in antioxidant activity and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as well as a reduction in oxidative damage. Additionally, RSV inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Furthermore, the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-\u03baB p65), and notch 1 protein were inhibited by RSV, indicating that inhibiting the Notch/NF-\u03baB pathway played a critical role in RSV-triggered heart protection in aging mice. Moreover, further data on intestinal function demonstrated that RSV significantly increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in intestinal contents and reduced the pH value in the feces of aging mice. RSV alleviated aging-induced cardiac dysfunction through the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation via the Notch/NF-\u03baB pathway in heart tissue.

We developed a diabetic cardiomyopathy mouse model by administering a high-fat diet in conjunction with a low-dose streptozotocin injection. Our analysis involved monitoring alterations in blood glucose and lipid levels, cardiac function and structure, as well as profibrotic factors such as \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), collagen I, collagen III, TGF-\u03b21, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin. These assessments were conducted using biochemical techniques, Doppler ultrasound, histopathology, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were extracted from suckling mice and cultivated in a high-glucose medium to simulate diabetes-induced myocardial fibrosis in vitro. These CFs were then subjected to coculture experiments with TGF-\u03b21 or Csn-B. The proliferation and migration of CFs were assessed using cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assays and Transwell assays, respectively. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were employed to evaluate the expression levels of NR4A1, p-NR4A1, and \u03b1-SMA in CFs treated with TGF-\u03b21 after NR4A1 knockdown or Csn-B administration, respectively. In diabetic heart tissue, the expression of p-NR4A1 was notably elevated. Furthermore, CFs exhibited enhanced proliferative capabilities and increased p-NR4A1 expression following high glucose exposure. Interestingly, NR4A1 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in the expression of fibrosis-related proteins in CFs following treatment with TGF-\u03b21. Moreover, our observations revealed a marked decrease in p-NR4A1 levels and a reduction in the expression of fibrosis-related proteins after Csn-B treatment. In diabetic mice treated with Csn-B, we noted diminished NR4A1 phosphorylation and a mitigation of myocardial fibrosis.

These two factors play an important role in cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration. The contractile property of cardiomyocytes depends on directed signal transmission over the electroconductive systems that happen inside the innate myocardium. Because of their distinctive electrical behavior, electroactive materials such as graphene might be used for the regeneration of cardiac tissue.\nIn this review, we aim to provide deep insight into the applications of graphene and graphene derivative-based hybrid polymeric scaffolds in cardiomyogenic differentiation and cardiac tissue regeneration.\nSynthetic biodegradable polymers are considered as a platform because their degradation can be controlled over time and easily functionalized. Therefore, graphene-polymeric hybrid scaffolds with anisotropic electrical behavior can be utilized to produce organizational and efficient constructs for macroscopic cardiac tissue engineering. In cardiac tissue regeneration, natural polymer based-scaffolds such as chitosan, gelatin, and cellulose can provide a permissive setting significantly supporting the differentiation and growth of the human induced pluripotent stem cells -derived cardiomyocytes, in large part due to their negligible immunogenicity and suitable biodegradability.\nCardiac tissue regeneration characteristically utilizes an extracellular matrix (scaffold), cells, and growth factors that enhance cell adhesion, growth, and cardiogenic differentiation.

Pieces of the heart tissue were either histologically analyzed to evaluate the decellularization processes or implanted for 5 days on 9-day-old chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and then histologically analyzed to evaluate CAM-implant interactions. Histological analysis of SLS or SD washed tissues showed different microscopic features of the decellularization processes, SLS-washing leading to the formation of a completely decellularized ECM layer at the periphery of the heart tissue. Both detergents induced changes in the spatial arrangement of collagen fibers of the heart tissue. Histological analysis of the CAM implants shoved that the peripheral zone with complete decellularization induced by SLS increased the biocompatibility of heart tissue implants by favoring neovascularization and cell migration.

However, its therapeutic usage is restricted by its known cardiotoxicity, which is associated with the production of oxidative stress. Enhancing antioxidant capacity represents a promising approach to mitigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Hesperidin (HES), a citrus bioflavonoid, possesses several pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics.\nThis study was designed to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of DOX and assess the possible cardioprotective role of HES.\nGroups of Wistar rats were either treated with DOX (4 mg/kg. bw., once a week for five consecutive weeks, intraperitoneally) or received co-treatment with HES (100 mg/kg. bw./day in distilled water, 5 days in a week for five consecutive weeks, administered orally). Heart and blood samples were obtained for histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical assessments.\nDOX administration resulted in severe cardiotoxicity, as evidenced by significant elevations in cardiac biomarkers, including Troponin I (CTnI), Creatine kinase (CK-Total), Creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). DOX also elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interferon \nWe can conclude that DOX induces severe cardiotoxicity characterized by oxidative stress, inflammation, pathological alterations, and apoptosis.

The myocardial infarction area in the IR group was markedly larger than that in the C group (P<0.01) but was significantly reduced after ulinastatin treatment (P<0.05), and the IR group had higher levels of AST, cTnI, CK-MB and LDH than C group, but the levels of those indexes were significantly reduced after ulinastatin treatment.The cardiomyocyte apoptosis was increased in the IR group compared with that in the C group, while it was decreased in the UR group in comparison with that in the IR group.

{"title": "Numerical study of the drift of scroll waves by optical feedback in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Nonlinear waves were found in various types of physical, chemical, and biological excitable media, e.g., in heart muscle. They can form three-dimensional (3D) vortices, called scroll waves, that are of particular significance in the heart, as they underlie lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Thus controlling the behavior of scroll waves is interesting and important. Recently, the optical feedback control procedure for two-dimensional vortices, called spiral waves, was developed. It can induce directed linear drift of spiral waves in optogenetically modified cardiac tissue. However, the extension of this methodology to 3D scroll waves is nontrivial, as optogenetic signals only penetrate close to the surface of cardiac tissue. Here we present a study of this extension in a two-variable reaction-diffusion model and in a detailed model of cardiac tissue. We show that the success of the control procedure is determined by the tension of the scroll wave filament. In tissue with positive filament tension the control procedure works in all cases. However, in the case of negative filament tension for a sufficiently large medium, instabilities occur and make drift and control of scroll waves impossible. Because in normal cardiac tissue the filament tension is assumed to be positive, we conclude that the proposed optical feedback scheme can be a robust method in inducing the linear drift of scroll waves that can control their positions in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Physical review.

The left ventricular function was analyzed by echocardiography. Histologic examinations of the cardiac tissues were performed through hematoxylin and eosin staining and TUNEL staining. The Vehicle group had worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiac injury markers, and enhanced myocardial apoptosis than the Sham group. The rats in the VNS groups had enhanced cardiac function, lower levels of cardiac injury markers, and inhibited myocardial apoptosis than those in the Vehicle group. Elevated interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-levels and activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa-B) signal in septic shock rats were inhibited by the performance of VNS.

{"title": "Expression of human cardiac-specific genes: a novel method for post-mortem interval estimation.", "abstract": "In legal medicine, the determination of post-mortem interval (PMI) is not only an important but also one of the most difficult aspects. Several methods are used to estimate PMI such as physicochemical, entomological, biochemical, metabolic, autolytic, and physical methods. These methods provide a wide range of PMI as they are affected by different factors. The approach behind the present study is to calculate an accurate PMI by using mRNA degradation and fold change expression (FCE) of cardiac-specific genes viz. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB) and cardiac troponin I (TNNI3). Seventeen cadaver heart tissues were analysed within a time frame of up to 12 hours from the time since death, at different time intervals at room temperature. Gene expression was determined and the data were analysed using the value of average delta Ct (\u0394Ct) value of the assessed gene and housekeeping gene. Delta delta Ct (\u0394\u0394Ct) method was used to calculate the FCE at the different 7-time groups. The FCE of TNNI3 was almost stable till 15 hours of PMI and then after 15 hours, expression shows a decrease up to 24 hours after death; whereas, NPPB shows that FCE was stable till 12 hours of PMI and then after 12 hours, expression shows a decrease up to 24 hours after death. The FCE of NPPB and TNNI3 was almost stable till 12 hours. Thus, the estimation of PMI by analysis of the FCE of cardiac-specific genes can be a new promising method in forensic medicine.\nW medycynie s\u0105dowej okre\u015blenie interwa\u0142u po\u015bmiertnego (PMI) jest nie tylko wa\u017cnym, ale i jednym z najtrudniejszych aspekt\u00f3w.

Cuproptosis is involved in various diseases, although its role in DCM is still unclear. Here, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of using genes related to cuproptosis as diagnostic biomarkers for DCM and the association of their expression with immune infiltration and drug target in cardiac tissue.\nGene expression data from nonfailure (NF) and DCM samples were retrieved from the GEO database. Cuproptosis scores were calculated using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key modules associated with DCM and cuproptosis. Random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were applied to identify signature genes. Finally, immune cell infiltration was assessed using ssGSEA. mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory networks and chemical-drug regulatory networks based on signature genes were analyzed by Cytoscape.\n8 modules were aggregated by WGCNA, among which MEblue was significantly associated with cuproptosis scores and DCM. A diagnostic model made up of six signature genes including SEPTIN1, CLEC11A, ISG15, P3H3, SDSL, and INKA1 was selected.

The infarct size in heart was assessed through TTC staining. The pathological section of heart tissue was evaluated through HE staining. The iron, Fe\nThrough GEO (GSE84796) database, SLAMF8 exhibited higher expression in heart failure patients. Furthermore, the ischemia/reperfusion SD rat (ischemia/reperfusion, I/R treatment) and H9C2 cell (hypoxia/reoxygenation, H/R treatment) models were set up. The mRNA and protein levels of SLAMF8 were upregulated in ischemia/reperfusion SD rat and H9C2 cell models. In addition, SLAMF8 inhibition alleviated ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial injury in SD rats. Moreover, SLAMF8 suppression inhibited ischemia/reperfusion-induced ferroptosis and oxidative stress. Further experiments were performed in H/R stimulated H9C2 cells, and the results showed that SLAMF8 knockdown alleviated H/R-induced cardiomyocyte death, ferroptosis and oxidative stress in H/R-induced cardiomyocyte. Lastly, SLAMF8 activated the TLR4/NOX4 pathway in I/R treated-SD rats or H/R treated-H9C2 cells.\nSLAMF8 aggravated ischemia/reperfusion-induced ferroptosis and injury in cardiomyocyte.

Scaffolds act as vehicles for cell-based therapeutics and regenerating diseased tissue. While there is a plethora of methods to generate hydrogels with tunable properties to mimic the tissue of interest, 3D bioprinting is a novel emerging technology with the capability to generate versatile patient-specific scaffolds typically embedded with tissue specific cells. Starch-based hydrogels are garnering attention in extrusion-based 3D printing, however owing to their poor mechanical strength and degradation render this material inefficient in its native form. Additionally, the effect of various printing process parameters on mechanical strength and bioactivity is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate the use of starch and gelatin as composite biomaterial ink and its effect on mechanical, physical and biological properties. We also investigated printability of composite hydrogels with the aim to understand the correlation between two infill patterns and its effect on mechanical, physicochemical, and biological properties. Our results showed that the composite hydrogels had competent mechanical properties and suitable bioactivity when seeded with H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Rheometric analyses provided a broader insight into the required viscosity for printing and has a direct correlation with the composition of the hydrogel. Thus, the composite materials are found to have tissue-specific mechanical properties and may serve as a better, cheaper and personalized alternative to existing scaffolds for the fabrication of engineered cardiac tissue.", "journal": "International journal of biological macromolecules", "date": "2023-12-29", "authors": ["RohinShyam", "ArunkumarPalaniappan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.128986"}

SGLT2i affected heart and liver signaling, but more reactive organs included the white adipose tissue, showing more lipolysis, and, particularly, the gut microbiome, with a lower relative abundance of bacteria taxa capable of fermenting phenylalanine and tryptophan to cardiovascular uremic toxins, resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds (including p-cresol sulfate). SGLT2i was detectable in murine stool samples and its addition to human stool microbiota fermentation recapitulated some murine microbiome findings, suggesting direct inhibition of fermentation of aromatic amino acids and tryptophan. In mice lacking SGLT2 and in patients with decompensated heart failure or diabetes, the SGLT2i likewise reduced circulating p-cresol sulfate, and p-cresol impaired contractility and rhythm in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived engineered heart tissue.\nSGLT2i reduced microbiome formation of uremic toxins such as p-cresol sulfate and thereby their body exposure and need for renal detoxification, which, combined with direct kidney effects of SGLT2i, including less proximal tubule glucotoxicity and a broad downregulation of apical transporters (including sodium, amino acid, and urate uptake), provides a metabolic foundation for kidney and cardiovascular protection.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2023-12-28", "authors": ["Anja MBilling", "Young ChulKim", "S\u00f8renGullaksen", "BenediktSchrage", "JaniceRaabe", "ArvidHutzfeldt", "FatihDemir", "ElinaKovalenko", "MoritzLass\u00e9", "AurelienDugourd", "RobinFallegger", "BirgitKlampe", "JohannesJaegers", "QingLi", "OlhaKravtsova", "MariaCrespo-Masip", "AmeliaPalermo", "Robert AFenton", "ElionHoxha", "StefanBlankenberg", "PaulusKirchhof", "Tobias BHuber", "EsbenLaugesen", "TanjaZeller", "MariaChrysopoulou", "JulioSaez-Rodriguez", "ChristinaMagnussen", "ThomasEschenhagen", "AlexanderStaruschenko", "GarySiuzdak", "Per LPoulsen", "ClarissaSchwab", "FriederikeCuello", "VolkerVallon", "Markus MRinschen"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.065517"}

Transcriptome studies of CHD in human pediatric patients indicated a broad spectrum of diverse molecular signatures across various types of CHD. In order to advance research on congenital heart diseases (CHDs), we conducted a detailed review of transcriptome studies on this topic. Our analysis identified gaps in the literature, with a particular focus on the cardiac transcriptome signatures found in various biological specimens across different types of CHDs. In addition to translational studies involving human subjects, we also examined transcriptomic analyses of CHDs in a range of model systems, including iPSCs and animal models. We concluded that RNA-seq technology has revolutionized medical research and many of the discoveries from CHD transcriptome studies draw attention to biological pathways that concurrently open the door to a better understanding of cardiac development and related therapeutic avenue. While some crucial impediments to perfectly studying CHDs in this context remain obtaining pediatric cardiac tissue samples, phenotypic variation, and the lack of anatomical/spatial context with model systems.

Resveratrol (Res) is a natural non-flavonoid polyphenol that can potentially provide cardiovascular benefits. We aimed to estimate the protective effect of Res on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) and explore whether it was related to attenuating ferroptosis. We established DIC models in C57BL/6\u00a0J mice, H9C2 cardiomyoblasts, and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). We further treated H9C2 cells with RSL3, a ferroptosis agonist, to investigate whether Res exerted protective effects through inhibiting ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was applied to suppress ferroptosis. Dox treatment caused cardiac dysfunction and resulted in apparent ferroptotic damage in cardiac tissue, involving increased iron accumulation, glutathione depletion, increased expression of ferroptosis-related proteins, and decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase 4, which were alleviated by Fer-1 and Res administration. These findings were also confirmed in Dox-treated H9C2 cells and NRCMs, with Fer-1 and Res effectively attenuating Dox-induced cytotoxicity and ferroptosis. Furthermore, Res protected H9C2 cells from RSL3-induced ferroptotic cell death, and the protective effect was similar to that of Fer-1. Both Dox and RSL3 treatment increased the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases; however, these changes were hindered by Res.

Myocardial tissues of mice challenged with angiotensin II (Ang II) or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) also showed that STING was consistently upregulated and activated. Activation of STING by cGAMP or DMXAA resulted in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro, which was abolished by STING knockout.

Herein, the Hg isotopic compositions of Antarctic cod Notothenia coriiceps were assessed in skeletal muscle, liver, and heart tissues to distinguish the differences in Hg accumulation in isolated coastal environments of the eastern (Chinese Zhongshan Station, ZSS) and the antipode western Antarctica (Chinese Great Wall Station, GWS), which are separated by over 4000\u00a0km. Differences in odd mass-independent isotope fractionation (odd-MIF) and mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) across fish tissues were reflection of the specific accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) and inorganic Hg (iHg) with different isotopic fingerprints. Internal metabolism including hepatic detoxification and processes related to heart may also contribute to MDF. Regional heterogeneity in iHg end-members further provided evidence that bioaccumulated Hg origins can be largely influenced by polar water circumstances and foraging behavior. Sea ice was hypothesized to play critical roles in both the release of Hg with negative odd-MIF derived from photoreduction of Hg", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "date": "2023-12-24", "authors": ["LinYang", "BenYu", "HongweiLiu", "XiaomengJi", "CailingXiao", "MengxiCao", "JianjieFu", "QinghuaZhang", "LigangHu", "YongguangYin", "JianboShi", "GuibinJiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169557"}
{"title": "Effect of apigenin on dynamin-related protein 1 in type 1 diabetic rats with cardiovascular complications.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular complications cause increased mortality rates among diabetics. The molecular mechanisms of aberrant mitochondrial dynamics in diabetes mellitus (DM) are not fully understood. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is thought to be a major regulator of mitochondrial fission. There is lack of studies that examined the relationship between apigenin and Drp1 expression in DM. Thus, the current study aimed to explore the expression of Drp1 in diabetic rats with cardiovascular complications, as well as to appraise the role of apigenin in modulating this expression.\nTwenty-eight adult male albino Wister rats were randomly and equally allocated into four groups: naive, streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic control and two apigenin-injected diabetic groups (early and late). Body weight, heart weight, blood pressure and ECG were recorded. Evaluation of blood glucose level, lipid profile and cardiac functions were measured. Determination of Drp1 mRNA expression, and histological examination of cardiac tissues from the four groups were performed.\nDiabetic control rats developed decrease of body weight, increase of blood pressure, deterioration of the normal ECG pattern and upregulation of Drp1 mRNA expression in cardiac tissues. There was a significant correlation between the relative expression of Drp1 and all examined parameters. Apigenin-injection improved fasting blood glucose, lipid profile and cardiac function indicators (i.e., ECG parameters, CK-MB and troponin) as well as the cardiac histological structure. The decrease of Drp1 expression was more evident with early than with late apigenin-injection, however, without statistical significance.\nIncreased level of Drp1 expression in diabetic rats may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications. The changes that occurred in response to apigenin injection highlight its potential ameliorative effect on the diabetic cardiovascular complications and pave the route for further investigations.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2023-12-24", "authors": ["SaraGamal Sherif", "MarwaTarek", "YasmineGamal Sabry", "AzzaHassan Abou Ghalia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2023.148107"}
{"title": "Cardiac PET Imaging of ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters: Opportunities and Challenges.", "abstract": "Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a broad family of membrane protein complexes that use energy to transport molecules across cells and/or intracellular organelle lipid membranes. Many drugs used to treat cardiac diseases have an affinity for these transporters. Among others, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays an essential role in regulating drug concentrations that reach cardiac tissue and therefore contribute to cardiotoxicity. As a molecular imaging modality, positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as a viable technique to investigate the function of P-gp in organs and tissues. Using PET imaging to evaluate cardiac P-gp function provides new insights for drug development and improves the precise use of medications. Nevertheless, information in this field is limited. In this review, we aim to examine the current applications of ABC transporter PET imaging and its tracers in the heart, with a specific emphasis on P-gp.

This study aims to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of GRb1@PLGA@NPs in HF treatment; (2) Methods: The left anterior descending coronary artery ligation was employed to establish a HF model in Sprague-Dawley rats, along with an in vitro oxidative stress model using H9c2 myocardial cells. Following treatment with GRb1@PLGA@NPs, cardiac tissue pathological changes and cell proliferation were observed.

{"title": "Cardiac-Targeting Peptide: From Discovery to Applications.", "abstract": "Despite significant strides in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, cardiovascular diseases remain the number one cause of mortality in the United States, with rates climbing at an alarming rate in the developing world. Targeted delivery of therapeutics to the heart has been a lofty goal to achieve with strategies ranging from direct intra-cardiac or intra-pericardial delivery, intra-coronary infusion, to adenoviral, lentiviral, and adeno-associated viral vectors which have preference, if not complete cardio-selectivity, for cardiac tissue. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are 5-30-amino-acid-long peptides that are able to breach cell membrane barriers while carrying cargoes up to several times their size, in an intact functional form. Identified nearly three decades ago, the first of these CPPs came from the HIV coat protein transactivator of transcription. Although a highly efficient CPP, its clinical utility is limited by its robust ability to cross any cell membrane barrier, including crossing the blood-brain barrier and transducing neuronal tissue non-specifically. Several strategies have been utilized to identify cell- or tissue-specific CPPs, one of which is phage display. Using this latter technique, we identified a cardiomyocyte-targeting peptide (CTP) more than a decade ago, a finding that has been corroborated by several independent labs across the world that have utilized CTP for a myriad of different purposes in pre-clinical animal models. The goal of this publication is to provide a comprehensive review of the identification, validation, and application of CTP, and outline its potential in diagnostic and therapeutic applications especially in the field of targeted RNA interference.", "journal": "Biomolecules", "date": "2023-12-23", "authors": ["DaniellaSahagun", "MalihaZahid"], "doi": "10.3390/biom13121690\n10.1016/j.suc.2022.01.007\n10.1186/s13073-022-01067-1\n10.1016/j.jacc.2021.09.006\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.118\n10.1371/journal.pone.0195088\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61774-8\n10.1001/jama.2019.0693\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab593\n10.1002/ejhf.2487\n10.1038/s41591-022-01826-y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095247\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.833335\n10.1186/1479-5876-9-183\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00915-X\n10.3390/gels7010029\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.06.061\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.04.013\n10.1161/CIRCEP.118.006408\n10.1172/JCI115902\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000065598.46411.EF\n10.1038/mt.2011.3\n10.1038/mt.2008.76\n10.1186/s13287-020-01881-7\n10.1016/j.molcel.2018.08.011\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00642\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00627-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.22.2554\n10.1038/s41598-020-69202-9\n10.3390/pharmaceutics12030225\n10.1016/0092-8674(88)90263-2\n10.1016/0092-8674(88)90262-0\n10.1073/pnas.88.5.1864\n10.1016/0092-8674(89)90417-0\n10.1126/science.285.5433.1569\n10.1126/science.4001944\n10.1007/978-1-60761-919-2_20\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012252\n10.1006/viro.2001.1254\n10.3390/biom8040147\n10.1016/j.jmb.2004.06.029\n10.1038/s41598-019-46407-1\n10.1002/advs.202302123\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aab3665\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.227\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.01.018\n10.1016/j.omtn.2021.04.018\n10.3390/ph15070871\n10.3389/fchem.2023.1220573\n10.3390/pharmaceutics15082107"}

Hence, in the current paper, we focused our attention on an alternative approach, exploiting products derived from human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) rather than MSCs themselves, which may denote a cost-effective and safer approach. The focus has been on EVs and the bioactive molecules they contain to evaluate their ability to influence the differentiation process toward cardiomyogenic lineage. The expression of GATA4, ACTC1, CX43, and Nkx2.5 was evaluated using Immunofluorescence, real time-PCR, and Western blotting analyses. Furthermore, the expression profiling analysis of the microRNA hsa-miR-200c-3p, targeting the GATA4 gene, was studied. The hsa-miR-200c-3p was found significantly down-regulated in both c-hDPSCs + EVs-hDPSCs and c-hDPSCs + EVs-HL-1 compared to untreated c-hDPSCs underlying a possible epigenetic mechanism behind the prevalent up-regulation of its targeted GATA4 gene. The aim of the present work was to develop an in vitro model of hDPSCs able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes in order to investigate the role of EVs derived from hDPSCs and derived from HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line in modulating the differentiation process toward cardiomyogenic lineage.", "journal": "BioFactors (Oxford, England)", "date": "2023-12-22", "authors": ["FrancescaDiomede", "SimoneGuarnieri", "PaolaLanuti", "FaniKonstantinidou", "ValentinaGatta", "Thangavelu SoundaraRajan", "Sante DPierdomenico", "OrianaTrubiani", "Guya DilettaMarconi", "JacopoPizzicannella"], "doi": "10.1002/biof.2025"}

This full-plate actuator/imager, OptoDyCE-plate, uses optogenetic stimulation and optical readouts of voltage and calcium (parallel recordings from up to 100 wells in 384-well plates are demonstrated). The system is validated with syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs, grown as monolayers, or in quasi-3D isotropic and anisotropic constructs using electrospun matrices, in 96 and 384-well format. Genetic modifications, e.g. interference CRISPR (CRISPRi), and nine compounds of acute and chronic action were tested, including five histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Their effects on voltage and calcium were compared across growth conditions and pacing rates. We also demonstrated optogenetic point pacing via cell spheroids to study conduction in 96-well format, as well as temporal multiplexing to register voltage and calcium simultaneously on a single camera. Opto-DyCE-plate showed excellent performance even in the small samples in 384-well plates. Anisotropic structured constructs may provide some benefits in drug testing, although drug responses were consistent across tested configurations. Differential voltage vs. calcium responses were seen for some drugs, especially for non-traditional modulators of cardiac function, e.g. HDACi, and pacing rate was a powerful modulator of drug response, highlighting the need for comprehensive multiparametric assessment, as offered by OptoDyCE-plate. Increasing throughput and speed and reducing cost of screening can help stratify potential compounds early in the drug development process and accelerate the development of safer drugs.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology plus", "date": "2023-12-22", "authors": ["Yuli WHeinson", "Julie LHan", "EmiliaEntcheva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmccpl.2023.100054"}

Changes in anatomy are indicative of remodeling processes as the heart tissue adapts to disease. Although robust segmentation methods exist for computed tomography angiography (CTA), few methods exist for whole-heart cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiograms (CMRA) which are more challenging due to variable contrast, lower signal to noise ratio and a limited amount of labeled data.\nTwo state-of-the-art unsupervised generative deep learning domain adaptation architectures, generative adversarial networks and variational auto-encoders, were applied to 3D whole heart segmentation of both conventional (n\u2009=\u200920) and high-resolution (n\u2009=\u200945) CMRA (target) images, given segmented CTA (source) images for training. An additional supervised loss function was implemented to improve performance given 10%, 20% and 30% segmented CMRA cases. A fully supervised nn-UNet trained on the given CMRA segmentations was used as the benchmark.\nThe addition of a small number of segmented CMRA training cases substantially improved performance in both generative architectures in both standard and high-resolution datasets. Compared with the nn-UNet benchmark, the generative methods showed substantially better performance in the case of limited labelled cases. On the standard CMRA dataset, an average 12% (adversarial method) and 10% (variational method) improvement in Dice score was obtained.\nUnsupervised domain-adaptation methods for CMRA segmentation can be boosted by the addition of a small number of supervised target training cases.

Urolithin A (UA; 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzopyran-6-one), a natural polyphenolic compound, has been extensively studied and shown to possess significant anti-inflammatory effects. Nevertheless, the specific effects of UA in SAP-associated acute cardiac injury (SACI) have not been definitively elucidated. Here, we investigated the therapeutic role and mechanisms of UA in SACI using transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics analyses in a mouse model of SACI and in vitro studies. SACI resulted in severely damaged pancreatic and cardiac tissues with myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial metabolism disorders. UA significantly reduced the levels of lipase, amylase and inflammatory factors, attenuated pathological damage to pancreatic and cardiac tissues, and reduced myocardial cell apoptosis and oxidative stress in SACI. Moreover, UA increased mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate production and restored mitochondrial metabolism, but the efficacy of UA was weakened by the inhibition of CPT1. Therefore, UA can attenuate cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce myocardial apoptosis by restoring the balance of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation metabolism. CPT1 may be a potential target.

{"title": "[hiPSCs and organoids: prediction of arrhythmogenic risks for optimized traditional Chinese medicine].", "abstract": "Accurate assessment of the risks associated with traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), such as the potential to induce serious cardiovascular adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, is crucial. This article introduced the pharmacological evaluation strategies for cardiac safety and the progress in cardiac organ research, with a focus on discussing the application prospects of human induced pluripotent stem cells(hiPSCs) and organoids in assessing the risks of TCM-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Compared with traditional animal models, hiPSCs and organoid models provide better reference and predictive capabilities, allowing for more accurate simulation of human cardiac responses. Researchers have successfully generated various cardiac tissue models that mimic the structure and function of the heart to evaluate the effects of TCM on the heart. The hiPSCs model, by reprogramming adult cells into pluripotent stem cells and differentiating them into cardiac cells, enables the generation of personalized cardiac tissue, which better reflects individual differences and drug responses. This provides guidance for the assessment of TCM cardiac toxicity risks. By combining organoid model with cardiac safety pharmacology strategies such as electrocardiogram monitoring and ion channel function assessment, the impact of TCM on the heart can be comprehensively evaluated. In addition, the application of the Comprehensive in Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay(CiPA) approach improves the accuracy of evaluation. Applying the CiPA approach to TCM research reveals potential risks and provides a scientific basis for the clinical application and industrial development of TCM. In conclusion, organoid model and cardiac safety pharmacology evaluation strategies provide important tools for assessing the cardiac toxicity risks of TCM. The combination of hiPSCs model, comprehensive assessment methods, and the CiPA strategy enables an accurate assessment of the risks of TCM-induced cardiac arrhythmias, thus providing a scientific basis for the safe use and international recognition of TCM in clinical practice.

Accumulated fibrous tissue renders myocardium stiffer and reduces its contractility. Empagliflozin is an oral hypoglycemic agent with extra-diabetic functional profile toward maintaining cardiac functions. The present study aimed to examine protective effect of empagliflozin against an in-vivo model of cardiac fibrosis induced by isoprenaline and targeting TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling as a possible pathway responsible for such effect.\nSixty animals were divided into six groups; the first was normal, and the second was treated with isoprenaline only (5\u00a0mg/kg/day I.P.) as a control. The third received pirfenidone (500\u00a0mg/kg/day P.O.), and the remaining groups received graded doses (5, 10, 20\u00a0mg/kg respectively) of empagliflozin for 14\u00a0days before fibrosis induction by isoprenaline (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 30\u00a0days.\nIsoprenaline increased cardiac enzymes, and cardiac tissues revealed elevated concentrations of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b21), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins.

However, the complicated pathology of cardiovascular diseases and the unique structure of cardiac tissue lead to challenges for effective immunoregulation therapy. Here, we exploited oral fullerene nanoscavenger (OFNS) to maintain intestinal redox homeostasis to resolve systemic inflammation for effectively preventing distal myocardial injury through bidirectional communication along the heart-gut immune axis. Observably, OFNS regulated redox microenvironment to repair cellular injury and reduce inflammation in vitro. Subsequently, OFNS prevented myocardial injury by regulating intestinal redox homeostasis and recovering epithelium barrier integrity in vivo. Based on the profiles of transcriptomics and proteomics, we demonstrated that OFNS balanced intestinal and systemic immune homeostasis for remote cardioprotection. Of note, we applied this principle to intervene myocardial infarction in mice and mini-pigs.

{"title": "Ameliorative effect of nebivolol in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the potential of nebivolol in preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by targeting the inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotic pathways. Twenty-eight male rats were randomly divided into four groups, each consisting of seven rats. The control group received standard diets and unrestricted access to water. The rats in the normal saline (N/S) group were administered a 0.9% normal saline solution for two weeks. The doxorubicin group (the \"induced group\") received doxorubicin at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg three times per week for two weeks. The nebivolol group received an oral dose of 4 mg/kg of nebivolol for the same duration. The cardiac tissues of rats treated with doxorubicin exhibited increased levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, malondialdehyde, and caspase-3 compared to the normal saline control group (p<0.05), along with decreased levels of total antioxidant capacity and Bcl-2. These results show that doxorubicin is harmful to the heart. The administration of nebivolol significantly reduced the cardiotoxic effects induced by doxorubicin, as indicated by a statistically significant decrease in the levels of inflammatory markers, specifically tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) (p<0.05). The nebivolol group exhibited a significant decrease in malondialdehyde levels, which serves as a signal of oxidation, in cardiac tissue compared to the doxorubicin-only group (p<0.05). Additionally, the nebivolol group showed a significant increase in overall antioxidant capacity.

Rats treated with doxorubicin (DOX), a chemotherapeutic agent, have increased cardiac expression of 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DHET), a bioactive lipid implicated in hypertension and coronary artery disease. However, the utility of 14,15-DHET as plasma biomarkers was not defined. The aim of this study is to investigate if levels of 14,15-DHET are an early blood biomarker to predict the subsequent occurrence of cardiotoxicity in cancer patients after chemotherapy.\nH9c2 rat cardiomyocytes were treated with DOX (1\u00a0\u03bcM) for 2\u00a0h and levels of 14,15-DHET in cell media was quantified at 2, 6 or 24\u00a0h in media after DOX treatment. Similarly, female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with DOX for two weeks and levels of 14,15-DHET was assessed in plasma at 48\u00a0h and 2\u00a0weeks after DOX treatment. Changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) mRNA, an early cardiac hypertrophy process, were determined in the H9c2 cells and rat cardiac tissue. Results were confirmed in human subjects by assessment of levels of 14,15-DHET in plasma of breast cancer patients before and after DOX treatment and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a clinical marker of cardiotoxicity.\nLevels of 14,15-DHET in cell media and rat plasma increased\u2009~\u20093-fold and was accompanied with increase in BNP mRNA in H9c2 cells and rat cardiac tissue after DOX treatment. In matched plasma samples from breast cancer patients, levels of 14,15-DHET were increased in patients that developed cardiotoxicity at 3\u00a0months before occurrence of LVEF decrease.\nTogether, these results indicate that levels of 14,15-DHET are elevated prior to major changes in cardiac structure and function after exposure to anthracyclines.

We previously reported that zonisamide, an antiepileptic drug, attenuated pressure overload-caused myocardial hypertrophy and diabetic cardiomyopathy in murine models. In addition, we have found that the inhibition of proteasome activates glycogen synthesis kinase 3 (GSK-3) thus alleviates myocardial hypertrophy, which is an important anti-hypertrophic strategy.

{"title": "ACE2 activation alleviates sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by promoting MasR-Sirt1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.", "abstract": "Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, is a major contributor to high mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has protective effects against several cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. However, the role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of SIC and underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The present study was designed to examine the effects of ACE2 activation or inhibition on SIC in C57BL/6 mice. The ACE2 activator diminazene aceturate (DIZE) and ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 were applied for treatment. Myocardial function, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis were investigated. Major assays were echocardiography, H&E staining, immunofluorescence staining, DHE staining, TUNEL staining, Western blot, qPCR analysis, ELISA and corresponding kits. We confirmed that ACE2 was markedly downregulated in septic heart tissues. Pharmacological activation of ACE2 by DIZE ameliorated cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced mortality, cardiac dysfunction, inflammatory response, oxidative stress and the cardiomyocyte apoptosis by promoting MasR-Sirt1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. In contrast, SIC was aggravated via inhibiting MasR-Sirt1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis by the use of ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760. Consequently, activation of ACE2 may protect against SIC by promoting MasR-Sirt1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2023-12-15", "authors": ["Tian-TianWan", "YaLi", "Jia-XinLi", "XueXiao", "LeiLiu", "Hui-HuaLi", "Shu-BinGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2023.109855"}
{"title": "Isolation of Toxoplasma gondii in cell culture: an alternative to bioassay.", "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan protozoan parasite that can infect mammals and birds. The infection can cause acute toxoplasmosis and death in susceptible hosts. Bioassay using cats and mice has been the standard for the isolation of T. gondii from infected hosts for the past several decades. However, bioassay is labor-intensive, expensive, and involves using laboratory animals. To search alternative approaches and o work towards replacement of animal experiments, we summarized the key literature and conducted four experiments to isolate T. gondii in vitro by cell culture. A few heart tissue samples from animals with the highest antibody titers in a given collection were used for T. gondii isolation. These experiments included samples from five out of 51 wild ducks, four of 46 wild turkeys, six of 24 white-tailed deer, as well as from six kangaroos that had died with acute toxoplasmosis in a zoo. These experiments resulted in three isolates from five chronically infected wild ducks (60%), four isolates from four chronically infected wild turkeys (100%), one isolate from six chronically infected white-tailed deer (17%), and four isolates from six kangaroos with acute toxoplasmosis (67%). In addition, five isolates from the five chronically infected wild ducks were obtained by bioassay in mice, showing a 100% success rate, which is higher than the 60% rate by direct cell culture. These T. gondii isolates were successfully propagated in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) or Vero cells, and genotyped by multilocus PCR-RFLP markers. The results showed that it is practical to isolate T. gondii directly in cell culture. Although the cell culture approach may not be as sensitive as the bioassay, it does provide an alternative that is simple, cost-effective, ethically more acceptable, and less time-sensitive to isolate T. gondii. In this paper we propose a procedure that may be applied and further optimized for isolation of T. gondii.", "journal": "International journal for parasitology", "date": "2023-12-15", "authors": ["TaniaDawant", "WeiWang", "MariaSpriggs", "GeraldoMagela de Faria Junior", "LauraHorton", "Nicole MSzafranski", "HelgaWaap", "PikkaJokelainen", "Richard WGerhold", "ChunleiSu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpara.2023.12.002"}

The experiment duration was 20 days and involved sixteen healthy albino rats, subdivided into four groups: the negative control group, in which rats received a daily dose of a placebo vehicle; the positive control group, receiving a daily placebo vehicle and a single dose of a combination of TRZ+DOX; the third group, pretreated with CoQ10 (10 mg/kg orally daily for 10 days), followed by 10 days of placebo vehicle and a single dose of a combination of TRZ+DOX at day 10; and finally, the fourth group pretreated with 10 days of placebo vehicle then followed by CoQ10 (10 mg/kg orally daily for 10 days) and a single dose of a combination of TRZ+DOX at day 10. Histological analysis of cardiac tissues was conducted, and the serum levels of cardiac troponin and redox markers were evaluated. The results showed that there were several histopathological changes like necrosis, edema, inflammation, and others in Group 2, which did not receive CoQ10, with high serum levels of cTnI. However, a high degree of improvement was achieved in Groups 3 and 4 in which rats were administered CoQ10 either before or after TRZ and DOX administration. The improvement was expressed by the disappearance of histopathological changes and a significant decrease in the serum level of cardiac troponin compared with Group 2. The findings of the study suggest that the administration of CoQ10 could be beneficial in minimizing the cardiac side effects caused by TRZ and DOX. This study provides a basis for further research and development of CoQ10 as a potential cardioprotective agent against the cardiac side effects of chemotherapy.", "journal": "Georgian medical news", "date": "2023-12-14", "authors": ["SAlkakaee", "JMamdoh"], "doi": null}
{"title": "In silico optical modulation of spiral wave trajectories in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation are common precursors to sudden cardiac death. They are associated with the occurrence of abnormal electrical spiral waves in the heart that rotate at a high frequency. In severe cases, arrhythmias are combated with a clinical method called defibrillation, which involves administering a single global high-voltage shock to the heart to reset all its activity and restore sinus rhythm. Despite its high efficiency in controlling arrhythmias, defibrillation is associated with several negative side effects that render the method suboptimal. The best approach to optimize this therapeutic technique is to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of spiral waves. Here, we use computational cardiac optogenetics to study and control the dynamics of a single spiral wave in a two-dimensional, electrophysiologically detailed, light-sensitive model of a mouse ventricle. First, we illuminate the domain globally by applying a sequence of periodic optical pulses with different frequencies in the sub-threshold regime where no excitation wave is induced. In doing so, we obtain epicycloidal, hypocycloidal, and resonant drift trajectories of the spiral wave core. Then, to effectively control the wave dynamics, we use a method called resonant feedback pacing. In this approach, each global optical pulse is applied when the measuring electrode positioned on the domain registers a predefined value of the membrane voltage. This enables us to steer the spiral wave in a desired direction determined by the position of the electrode. Our study thus provides valuable mechanistic insights into the success or failure of global optical stimulation in executing efficient arrhythmia control.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2023-12-14", "authors": ["SayedehHussaini", "RupamanjariMajumder", "ValentinKrinski", "StefanLuther"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-023-02889-7\n10.1126/science.1195929\n10.1007/s00395-022-00933-8\n10.1016/0375-9601(93)90642-D\n10.1006/jtbi.1994.1132\n10.1023/A:1005134901624\n10.1152/ajpheart.00185.2003\n10.1038/nmeth.1512\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.196\n10.1073/pnas.87.22.8785\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1007/BF01043605\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.825091\n10.1002/clc.4960270604\n10.1063/1.1395624\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.3368\n10.1103/PhysRevE.60.5073\n10.7554/eLife.59954\n10.1103/PhysRevE.105.044210\n10.1038/nature10216\n10.7554/eLife.41076\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.17.064033\n10.1111/2Fj.1540-8159.2010.02971.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00493.2011\n10.1103/PhysRevE.81.010901\n10.1007/s003329900076\n10.1088/1367-2630/10/1/015003\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.11.019\n10.1038/366322a0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.004\n10.1161/hc3101.093906\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003220\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.3398"}

However, fast and accurate identification, as well as the targeted protection of injured cardiomyocytes following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)\u00a0injury, remain significantly challenging. Here, a near infrared heptamethine dye IR-780 is shown that has the potential to quickly monitor the area at risk following I/R injury by selectively entering the cardiomyocytes of the at-risk heart tissues. Preconditioning with IR-780 or timely IR-780 administration before reperfusion significantly protects the heart from ischemia and oxidative stress-induced cell death, myocardial remodeling, and heart failure in both rat and pig models. Furthermore, IR-780 can directly bind to F0F1-ATP synthase of cardiomyocytes, rapidly decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential, and subsequently slow down the mitochondrial energy metabolism, which induces the mitochondria into a \"quiescent state\" and results in mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibition by preventing mitochondrial calcium overload.

{"title": "Diagnostic potential of energy metabolism-related genes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.", "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with changes in cardiac metabolism that affect energy supply in the heart. However, there is limited research on energy metabolism-related genes (EMRGs) in HFpEF.\nThe HFpEF mouse dataset (GSE180065, containing heart tissues from 10 HFpEF and five control samples) was sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene expression profiles in HFpEF and control groups were compared to identify differentially expressed EMRGs (DE-EMRGs), and the diagnostic biomarkers with diagnostic value were screened using machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, we constructed a biomarker-based nomogram model for its predictive power, and functionality of diagnostic biomarkers were conducted using single-gene gene set enrichment analysis, drug prediction, and regulatory network analysis. Additionally, consensus clustering analysis based on the expression of diagnostic biomarkers was utilized to identify differential HFpEF-related genes (HFpEF-RGs). Immune microenvironment analysis in HFpEF and subtypes were performed for analyzing correlations between immune cells and diagnostic biomarkers as well as HFpEF-RGs. Finally, qRT-PCR analysis on the HFpEF mouse model was used to validate the expression levels of diagnostic biomarkers.\nWe selected 5 biomarkers (Chrna2, Gnb3, Gng7, Ddit4l, and Prss55) that showed excellent diagnostic performance. The nomogram model we constructed demonstrated high predictive power. Single-gene gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment in aerobic respiration and energy derivation. Further, various miRNAs and TFs were predicted by Gng7, such as Gng7-mmu-miR-6921-5p, ETS1-Gng7. A lot of potential therapeutic targets were predicted as well. Consensus clustering identified two distinct subtypes of HFpEF. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted the involvement of DEGs-cluster in protein amino acid modification and so on. Additionally, we identified five HFpEF-RGs (Kcnt1, Acot1, Kcnc4, Scn3a, and Gpam).

{"title": "Chemokine CCL2 promotes cardiac regeneration and repair in myocardial infarction mice via activation of the JNK/STAT3 axis.", "abstract": "Stimulation of adult cardiomyocyte proliferation is a promising strategy for treating myocardial infarction (MI). Earlier studies have shown increased CCL2 levels in plasma and cardiac tissue both in MI patients and mouse models. In present study we investigated the role of CCL2 in cardiac regeneration and the underlying mechanisms. MI was induced in adult mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery, we showed that the serum and cardiac CCL2 levels were significantly increased in MI mice. Intramyocardial injection of recombinant CCL2 (rCCL2, 1\u2009\u03bcg) immediately after the surgery significantly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation, improved survival rate and cardiac function, and diminished scar sizes in post-MI mice. Alongside these beneficial effects, we observed an increased angiogenesis and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in post-MI mice. Conversely, treatment with a selective CCL2 synthesis inhibitor Bindarit (30\u2009\u03bcM) suppressed both CCL2 expression and cardiomyocyte proliferation in P1 neonatal rat ventricle myocytes (NRVMs). We demonstrated in NRVMs that the CCL2 stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation through STAT3 signaling: treatment with rCCL2 (100\u2009ng/mL) significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of STAT3, whereas a STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor Stattic (30\u2009\u03bcM) suppressed rCCL2-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation.

However, instruments for such experimentation often (1) involve delicate mounting of the muscle, (2) constrain investigations to one muscle at a time and, thus, (3) cannot retain the muscle in the same experimental configuration for post-experimental assessment including imaging analysis. Here, we present a novel device that allows trabeculae to be secured by a visible-light photo-initiated hydrogel, manipulated via a force sensor, and stimulated while being imaged. We use our robust, accurate image registration techniques to measure cantilever and gel deformation during trabecula contraction and thereby provide a measure of trabecula force production during twitches. A variety of experiments can then be conducted, with the potential for the trabecula to be fixed in place using hydrogel for further post-experiment analysis, as well as longitudinal evaluation.

In order to model the effects of these diseases and investigate underlying causes we are developing a cardiomyocyte model which incorporates both the mechanics and metabolic factors that underlie work done by the heart. In this paper we present the first experimental results from our study measuring mechanical properties in human cardiac trabeculae, including the effect of inorganic phosphate (Pi) on the complex modulus at 37 \u00b0C. Extending our previous mathematical model, we have developed a computationally efficient model of cardiac cross-bridge mechanics which is sensitive to changes in cellular Pi. This extended model was parameterised with human cardiac complex modulus data. It captured the changes to cardiac mechanics following an increase in Pi concentration that we measured experimentally, including a reduced elastic modulus and a right-shift in frequency. The human cardiac trabecula we studied had a low sensitivity to Pi compared to what has been previously reported in mammalian cardiac tissue, which suggests that the muscle may have cellular compensatory mechanisms to cope with elevated Pi levels. This study demonstrates the feasibility of our experimental-modelling pipeline for future investigation of mechanical and metabolic effects in the diseased human heart.Clinical Relevance- This study presents the first measurement of the effect of Pi on the stiffness frequency response of human cardiac tissue and extends an experimental-modelling framework appropriate for investigating effects of disease on the human heart.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Additionally, HIF-1\u03b1 was identified as the direct target of miR-155. As expected, over-expression of HIF-1\u03b1 greatly reversed the effects of agomiR-155 on cardiac function and the expression of apoptosis-associated markers in heart tissues of HF mice.\nMiR-155 overexpression can suppress myocardial cell apoptosis through HIF-1\u03b1, and strongly alleviate the cardiac function damage in HF mice, indicating the potential of miR-155/HIF-1\u03b1 axis to be a target for the diagnosis and therapy of HF.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2023-12-11", "authors": ["YuntaoLuo", "XuDeng", "QingyangChen", "YahongCai", "MingkeBie", "YuantingZhang", "LiqiPeng", "KunpengYao", "XinyuChen", "HuzhiCai"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Prognostic Value of Galectin-3 after Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion for Predicting Peri-Device Leakage.", "abstract": "Echocardiographic detection of residual peri-device leakage (PDL) after percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is crucial for managing anticoagulation. Galectin-3, a protein involved in tissue-foreign body interactions, may hold significance in understanding PDL and cardiac tissue remodeling after LAAO. This study aimed to analyze galectin-3 serum levels in relation to PDL using a novel echo-morphological classification. LAAO eligible patients were included in the study. Galectin-3 serum levels were measured before LAAO, at 45 days (45D), and at 6 months (6M) after the procedure. Transesophageal echocardiography was used to assess LAAO success. A new echo-morphological classification categorized the degree of LAAO into three different types (A: homogenous echodensity, indicating completely thrombosed device; B: inhomogeneous echolucencies (<50% of device); and C: partially thrombosed device with echolucencies > 50%). Among 47 patients, complete LAAO was achieved in 60% after 45D and in 74% after 6M.

{"title": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Induces Proangiogenic Profiling of Cardiosphere-Derived Cell Secretome and Increases Its Ability to Stimulate Angiogenic Properties of Endothelial Cells.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease and its complications, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure, are the leading causes of death in modern society. The adult heart innately lacks the capacity to regenerate the damaged myocardium after ischemic injury. Multiple lines of evidence indicated that stem-cell-based transplantation is one of the most promising treatments for damaged myocardial tissue. Different kinds of stem cells have their advantages for treating ischemic heart disease. One facet of their mechanism is the paracrine effect of the transplanted cells. Particularly promising are stem cells derived from cardiac tissue per se, referred to as cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), whose therapeutic effect is mediated by the paracrine mechanism through secretion of multiple bioactive molecules providing immunomodulatory, angiogenic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Although secretome-based therapies are increasingly being used to treat various cardiac pathologies, many obstacles remain because of population heterogeneity, insufficient understanding of potential modulating compounds, and the principles of secretome regulation, which greatly limit the feasibility of this technology. In addition, components of the inflammatory microenvironment in ischemic myocardium may influence the secretome content of transplanted CDCs, thus altering the efficacy of cell therapy. In this work, we studied how Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), as a key component of the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in damaged myocardium from ischemic injury and heart failure, may affect the secretome content of CDCs and their angiogenic properties. We have shown for the first time that TNFa may act as a promising compound modulating the CDC secretome, which induces its profiling to enhance proangiogenic effects on endothelial cells. These results allow us to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the impact of the inflammatory microenvironment on transplanted CDCs and may contribute to the optimization of CDC efficiency and the development of the technology for producing the CDC secretome with enhanced proangiogenic properties for cell-free therapy.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-12-09", "authors": ["KonstantinDergilev", "EkaterinaZubkova", "AlikaGuseva", "ZoyaTsokolaeva", "YuliaGoltseva", "IrinaBeloglazova", "ElizavetaRatner", "AlexanderAndreev", "StanislavPartigulov", "MikhailLepilin", "MikhailMenshikov", "YelenaParfyonova"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms242316575\n10.1136/heartjnl-2023-322803\n10.1016/S1388-9842(02)00017-X\n10.1007/s00395-022-00913-y\n10.26442/00403660.2020.04.000634\n10.1155/2016/9098523\n10.1007/s10517-021-05104-8\n10.1007/s10517-022-05525-z\n10.1016/j.jchf.2013.08.008\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.655209\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw240\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.11.029\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab419\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304671\n10.1016/j.vascn.2013.09.003\n10.1007/s12015-012-9408-1\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.08.016\n10.3760/CMA.J.ISSN.1008-1275.2009.06.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.09.020\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.235713\n10.1016/0024-3205(95)02077-V\n10.1161/01.RES.0000014451.75415.36\n10.1152/ajpheart.01210.2003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00797.2007\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.03.006\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.16.2055\n10.3389/fimmu.2023.1219907\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.02.006\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401189\n10.1089/ars.2016.6931\n10.1016/S0898-6568(01)00262-5\n10.1002/jcb.25263\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65284-4\n10.1042/bst0311171\n10.1042/BST20110651\n10.1038/337471a0\n10.1096/fj.01-0633fje\n10.1159/000078333\n10.1006/cyto.1995.0031\n10.1189/jlb.68.1.1\n10.1186/s13287-019-1224-y\n10.3390/ijms22020763"}
{"title": "A Flexible PDMS-Based Optical Biosensor for Stretch Monitoring in Cardiac Tissue Samples.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity, characterized by adverse impacts on normal heart function due to drug exposure, is a significant concern due to the potentially serious side effects associated with various pharmaceuticals. It is essential to detect the cardiotoxicity of a drug as early as possible in the testing phase of a medical composite. Therefore, there is a pressing need for more reliable in vitro models that accurately mimic the in vivo conditions of cardiac biopsies. In a functional beating heart, cardiac muscle cells are under the effect of static and cyclic stretches. It has been demonstrated that cultured cardiac biopsies can benefit from external mechanical loads that resemble the in vivo condition, increasing the probability of cardiotoxicity detection in the early testing stages. In this work, a biosensor is designed and fabricated to allow for stretch monitoring in biopsies and tissue cultures using an innovative sensing mechanism.

{"title": "Pharmacokinetics and molecular docking of the cardioprotective flavonoids in Dalbergia odorifera.", "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to investigate the cardioprotective effects and pharmacokinetics of Dalbergia odorifera flavonoids. The cardioprotective effects were detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining histopathological observations and the detection of myocardial enzymes by kits in serum, peroxidation and antioxidant levels and ATPase activities by kits in the homogenate supernatant, and antioxidant and apoptosis-related protein expression in heart tissue by immunohistochemistry. The pharmacokinetics parameters of the flavonoids in rat plasma were investigated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Molecular docking of the compounds absorbed by the blood with specific proteins was carried out. D. odorifera flavonoids significantly reduced the levels of creatinine kinase, alanine transaminase, nitric oxide, and Hydrogen peroxide, elevated the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and ATPase, significantly reduced the pathological degree of heart tissue and had obvious anti-myocardial ischemia efficacy. Nine out of the 17 flavonoids were detected in rat plasma. The peak concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve values of 3'-O-methylviolanone and sativanone were significantly higher than those of other ingredients. The peak time of most flavonoids (except for Genistein and Pruneion) was lower than 2\u00a0h, while the half-life of elimination of the nine flavonoids ranged from 3.32 to 21.5\u00a0h. The molecular docking results showed that daidzein, dalbergin, formononetin, and genistein had the potential to bind to the target proteins. The results of the study provide an important basis for understanding the cardioprotective effects and clinical application of D. odorifera.", "journal": "Journal of separation science", "date": "2023-12-09", "authors": ["CanhongWang", "BaoGong", "YulanWu", "CongwenBai", "MeihuaYang", "XiangshengZhao", "JianheWei"], "doi": "10.1002/jssc.202300614"}

The corresponding rAAV (1\u00d71011 virion-like particles) was intravenously injected. At 2 weeks after the injection of rAAV, all rats were euthanatized, and the organs were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C for further experiments. The total RNA and total protein were extracted from heart tissues, and the expression levels of rAAV-miR-320a and rAAV-miR-320aTuDs in heart tissues were determined via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect the mRNA and protein expressions in heart tissues, respectively.

Potential mechanisms include autonomic dysregulation due to excess catecholamines as well as systemic inflammation. Understanding how inflammation contributes to cardiac dysfunction may aid in identifying novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we investigated serum leukocytes as predictors of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with aSAH. We also investigated increased cardiac macrophages in an animal model of SAH and whether immunomodulatory treatment could attenuate this inflammatory response.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 256 patients with aSAH admitted to University of Illinois Hospital between 2013 and 2019. Our inclusion criteria included patients with aSAH receiving an echocardiogram within 72\u00a0h of admission. Our primary outcome was echocardiographic evidence of systolic dysfunction. We performed multinomial regression and receiver operating curve analysis. We also used the endovascular perforation model of SAH in male Sprague-Dawley rats to assess for myocardial inflammation. Two days after surgery, hearts were collected and stained for the macrophage marker Iba-1. We compared the presence and morphology of macrophages in cardiac tissue isolated from SAH animals and sham controls treated with and without the immunomodulatory agent fingolimod.\nOf 256 patients with aSAH, 233 (91.0%) underwent echocardiography within 72\u00a0h of admission. Of 233, 81 (34.7%) had systolic dysfunction. Patients had baseline differences in the presence of hypertension, alcohol use, and admission Glasgow Coma Scale and Hunt-Hess score. On multivariable analysis, total leukocytes (odds ratio 1.312, p\u2009<\u20090.001), neutrophils (odds ratio 1.242, p\u2009=\u20090.012), and monocytes (odds ratio 6.112, p\u2009=\u20090.008) were independent predictors of reduced systolic function, whereas only monocytes (odds ratio 28.014, p\u2009=\u20090.030) predicted hyperdynamic function. Within the rodent heart, there were increased macrophages after SAH relative to controls, and this was attenuated by fingolimod treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nIncreased serum leukocytes are associated with abnormal left ventricular systolic function following aSAH.

{"title": "Dissolution of spiral wave's core using cardiac optogenetics.", "abstract": "Rotating spiral waves in the heart are associated with life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. These arrhythmias are treated by a process called defibrillation, which forces electrical resynchronization of the heart tissue by delivering a single global high-voltage shock directly to the heart. This method leads to immediate termination of spiral waves. However, this may not be the only mechanism underlying successful defibrillation, as certain scenarios have also been reported, where the arrhythmia terminated slowly, over a finite period of time. Here, we investigate the slow termination dynamics of an arrhythmia in optogenetically modified murine cardiac tissue both in silico and ex vivo during global illumination at low light intensities. Optical imaging of an intact mouse heart during a ventricular arrhythmia shows slow termination of the arrhythmia, which is due to action potential prolongation observed during the last rotation of the wave. Our numerical studies show that when the core of a spiral is illuminated, it begins to expand, pushing the spiral arm towards the inexcitable boundary of the domain, leading to termination of the spiral wave. We believe that these fundamental findings lead to a better understanding of arrhythmia dynamics during slow termination, which in turn has implications for the improvement and development of new cardiac defibrillation techniques.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2023-12-07", "authors": ["SayedehHussaini", "Sarah LL\u00e4dke", "JohannesSchr\u00f6der-Schetelig", "VishaliniVenkatesan", "Ra\u00fal AQui\u00f1onez Uribe", "ClaudiaRichter", "RupamanjariMajumder", "StefanLuther"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011660\n10.1038/225535b0\n10.1016/0039-6028(67)90005-2\n10.1056/NEJM198801073180105\n10.1002/clc.4960270604\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.004\n10.1056/NEJMoa071098\n10.1056/NEJM199612263352601\n10.1038/nature10216\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.825091\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.03.015\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.10.018\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.3.H1055\n10.1007/BF02363286\n10.1016/S0006-3495(89)82897-8\n10.1103/PhysRevE.81.010901\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01651\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.054101\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.094101\n10.1038/nature26001\n10.1073/pnas.2103979118\n10.7554/eLife.41076\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.196\n10.7554/eLife.59954\n10.1063/5.0122273\n10.1103/PhysRevE.106.024405\n10.1038/nmeth.1512\n10.1172/JCI88950\n10.1113/JP276283\n10.1038/srep35628\n10.1152/ajpheart.00185.2003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00493.2011\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003220\n10.1126/science.191.4226.485\n10.1038/nsmb908\n10.1161/01.RES.69.3.842\n10.1007/s00395-022-00933-8\n10.1114/1.1289474\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018052"}

Herein, we tested whether EGCG participates in modulating cardiac ischemia reperfusion-induced injury and elucidate its potential mechanisms.\nTo induce MI in mice, we employed coronary artery ligation, while cell models utilized oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-treated HL-1 cells. TTC, HE and Massion staining evaluated the pathological changes of heart tissues. Besides, RNA-pull down and RIP assays analyzed the interactions of MEG3/TAF15 and AIM2 mRNA/TAF15. FISH associated with immunofiuorescence (IF) double staining was conducted to measure the co-localization of MEG3 and TAF15.\nIn vitro and in vivo evidence supported that EGCG treatment improved cardiomyocytes viability while inhibiting the expressions of AIM2, C-caspase-1, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2. Knockdown of MEG3 intensified EGCG's therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo. LncRNA MEG3 and AIM2 mRNA interacted with TAF15, and MEG3, in turn, promoted the stability of AIM2 mRNA through regulating TAF15. Overexpression of TAF15 reversed the promoting effect of EGCG and MEG3 knockdown on cell viability, and the inhibiting effect on cell pyroptosis.\nEGCG protected cardiomyocytes from pyroptosis by the MEG3/TAF15/AIM2 axis, indicating EGCG as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for managing MI.", "journal": "Chinese medicine", "date": "2023-12-07", "authors": ["ChaoshiQin", "TingtingWang", "NiQian", "JingLiu", "RongXi", "QingZou", "HuiLiu", "XiaolinNiu"], "doi": "10.1186/s13020-023-00856-z\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1161/JAHA.117.008024\n10.1096/fj.00-0519fje\n10.1096/fj.04-1716fje\n10.1111/jcmm.12895\n10.1142/S0192415X20500172\n10.1002/brb3.1633\n10.3390/ijms19092475\n10.1038/s41598-017-14451-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310624\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.024\n10.1038/s41419-021-04143-3\n10.1111/cpr.12563\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2017.08.023\n10.1080/15384047.2021.1964320\n10.1111/jcmm.13754\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312117\n10.1038/nrd.2017.106\n10.1155/2017/5615647\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.117014\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.10.004\n10.1046/j.1365-2443.2000.00320.x\n10.1210/jc.2003-030222\n10.1210/jc.2004-1848\n10.1002/jcb.26304\n10.3390/cells8030263\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2019.113139\n10.1002/cam4.3268\n10.1016/j.taap.2022.115975\n10.1016/j.cca.2020.08.031\n10.1038/nature07725\n10.1038/nature07710\n10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106533"}

In the absence of hypoxia, HIF is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PHs). Pharmacological HIF-PH inhibition stabilizes HIF and is being studied as a treatment for anemia. However, like sustained hypoxia, HIF-PH inhibition may increase pulmonary arterial pressure leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to assess the cardiac effects of sustained pharmacological HIF-PH inhibition using multimodal imaging, blood analysis, and histology.\nRats were dosed daily with a pan HIF-PH inhibitor or vehicle for 4\u00a0weeks followed by a 2-week washout period and underwent longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography to simultaneously assess RV and LV function. Blood samples from weeks four and six were analyzed to determine red blood cell composition. Histology was performed on the cardiac tissue from a subset of rats at weeks four and six to assess structural effects.\nImaging revealed that RV ejection fraction was reduced in animals receiving HIF-PH inhibitor and resulted in RV hypertrophy. Interestingly, HIF-PH inhibition had the opposite effect on the left ventricle (LV), increasing contractility measured by LV ejection fraction. LV effects were reversed by week six, while RV effects (functional and structural) were sustained.\nThese opposing cardiac effects of HIF-PH inhibition warrant further study to both understand the potential negative effects on RV structure and function and investigate the therapeutic potential of increased LV contractility for conditions like heart failure.", "journal": "Molecular imaging and biology", "date": "2023-12-07", "authors": ["GainRobinson", "MarkZielstorff", "RaquelSevilla", "AmyVanko", "ChristopherSinz", "MilenkoCicmil", "WeishengZhang", "KimberlyBettano"], "doi": "10.1007/s11307-023-01876-9\n10.1124/mol.106.027029\n10.1096/fj.01-0125com\n10.1021/jm400386j\n10.1056/NEJMoa2035938\n10.1056/NEJMoa2113380\n10.1111/bcp.15055\n10.1159/000518071\n10.1016/j.kisu.2020.12.002\n10.1164/rccm.201302-0302OC\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00643.2013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305109\n10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00274\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105020\n10.2147/DDDT.S175887\n10.1007/s11255-020-02671-z\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01242\n10.1165/rcmb.2020-0023OC\n10.1161/01.RES.16.3.244\n10.1152/japplphysiol.91256.2008\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00185.2012\n10.1128/MCB.00432-13\n10.1161/01.RES.0000197816.63513.27\n10.1161/hc4301.097193\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2005.10.009\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e2bfef\n10.1371/journal.pone.0255022\n10.1056/NEJMoa0907845\n10.1056/NEJMoa1214865"}

{"title": "Unsupervised deep network for image texture transformation: Improving the quality of cross-correlation analysis and mechanical vortex visualisation during cardiac fibrillation.", "abstract": "Visualisation of cardiac fibrillation plays a very considerable role in cardiophysiological study and clinical applications. One of the ways to obtain the image of these phenomena is the registration of mechanical displacement fields reflecting the track from electrical activity. In this work, we read these fields using cross-correlation analysis from the video of open pig's epicardium at the start of fibrillation recorded with electrocardiogram. However, the quality of obtained displacement fields remains low due to the weak pixels heterogeneity of the frames. It disables to see more clearly such interesting phenomena as mechanical vortexes that underline the mechanical dysfunction of fibrillation. The applying of chemical or mechanical markers to solve this problem can affect the course of natural processes and falsify the results. Therefore, we developed a novel scheme of an unsupervised deep neural network that is based on the state-of-art positional coding technology for a multilayer perceptron. This network enables to generate a couple of frames with a more heterogeneous pixel texture, that is more suitable for cross-correlation analysis methods, from two consecutive frames. The novel network scheme was tested on synthetic pairs of images with different texture heterogeneity and frequency of displacement fields and also it was compared with different filters on our cardiac tissue image dataset. The testing showed that the displacement fields obtained with our method are closer to the ground truth than those which were computed only with the cross-correlation analysis in low contrast images case where filtering is impossible. Moreover, our model showed the best results comparing with the one of the popular filter CLAHE on our dataset. As a result, using our approach, it was possible to register more clearly a mechanical vortex on the epicardium at the start of fibrillation continuously for several milliseconds for the first time.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2023-12-06", "authors": ["DariaMangileva", "AlexanderKursanov", "LeonidKatsnelson", "OlgaSolovyova"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22207"}

Studies on rats fed with a high-fat diet (HD) showed contradictory results: some demonstrated increased sensitivity of the heart and kidney to IR injury, while others reported resistance. In this study, we examined cardiac dysfunction and compromised cardiac tolerance associated with renal IR in HD and standard diet (SD) fed rats. Male Wistar rats fed with HD or SD diet for 16 weeks were subjected to either renal sham or IR protocol (bilateral clamping for 45\u00a0min and reperfusion for 24\u00a0h). The hearts isolated from these rats were further subjected to normal perfusion or IR procedure to study cardiac response. Renal IR surgery negatively affected cardiac function with substantial changes in the cardiac tissues, like mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, and inflammation. HD-fed rat hearts exhibited hypertrophy at the end of 16 weeks, and the consequential impact on the heart was higher in the animals underwent renal IR surgery than with sham surgery. However, the IR induction in the isolated heart from renal sham or renal IR operation showed significant tissue injury resistance and better physiological recovery in HD-fed rats. However, in SD-fed rats, only hearts from renal IR-operated rats showed resistance to cardiac IR, whereas hearts from renal sham-operated rats were more susceptible to IR damage.

{"title": "Comparison of the preconditioning effect of different exercise training modalities on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "The study of exercise preconditioning can develop strategies to prevent cardiovascular diseases and outline the efficient exercise model. However, the exercise type with the most protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury is unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of three kinds of exercise preconditioning on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in adult rats and explored the possible underlying mechanisms. Male Wistar rats subjected to ten weeks of endurance, resistance, and concurrent training underwent ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (120 min) induction. Then, infarction size, serum levels of the CK-MB, the redox status, and angiogenesis proteins (VEGF, ANGP-1, and ANGP-2) were measured in the cardiac tissue. Results showed that different exercise training modes have the same reduction effects on infarction size, but ischemia-reperfusion-induced CK-MB was lower in response to endurance training and concurrent training. Furthermore, cardiac VEGF levels increased in all three kinds of exercise preconditioning but ischemia-reperfusion-induced ANGP-1 elevated more in endurance training. The cardiac GPX activity was improved significantly through the resistance and concurrent exercise compared to the endurance exercise. In addition, all three exercise preconditioning models decreased MPO levels, and ischemia reperfusion-induced MDA was lower in endurance and resistance training. Overall, these results indicated that cardioprotection of exercise training against ischemia-reperfusion injury depends on the exercise modality. Cardioprotective effects of aerobic, resistance, and concurrent exercises are due to different mechanisms. The preconditioning effects of endurance training are mediated mainly by pervasive angiogenic responses and resistance training through oxidative stress amelioration.

Currently available treatment options face a number of drawbacks, hence cardiac tissue engineering, which aims to bioengineer functional cardiac tissue, for application in tissue repair, patient specific drug screening and disease modeling, is being explored as a viable alternative. To achieve this, an appropriate combination of cells, biomimetic scaffolds mimicking the structure and function of the native tissue, and signals, is necessary. Among scaffold fabrication techniques, three-dimensional printing, which is an additive manufacturing technique that enables to translate computer-aided designs into 3D objects, has emerged as a promising technique to develop cardiac patches with a highly defined architecture. As a further step toward the replication of complex tissues, such as cardiac tissue, more recently 3D bioprinting has emerged as a cutting-edge technology to print not only biomaterials, but also multiple cell types simultaneously. In terms of bioinks, biomaterials isolated from natural sources are advantageous, as they can provide exceptional biocompatibility and bioactivity, thus promoting desired cell responses. An ideal biomimetic cardiac patch should incorporate additional functional properties, which can be achieved by means of appropriate functionalization strategies. These are essential to replicate the native tissue, such as the release of biochemical signals, immunomodulatory properties, conductivity, enhanced vascularization and shape memory effects. The aim of the review is to present an overview of the current state of the art regarding the development of biomimetic 3D printed natural biomaterial-based cardiac patches, describing the 3D printing

However, the specific pharmacological effects of HNG in heart failure (HF) have not been previously reported. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the potential protective effect of HNG in HF using a mouse model. HF was induced in mice through intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol or transverse aortic constriction, followed by separate administration of HNG to assess its therapeutic impact. Our results revealed that HNG treatment significantly delayed the onset of cardiac dysfunction and structural remodeling in the HF mouse model. Furthermore, HNG administration was associated with reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, improved myocardial fibrosis, and attenuation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the treated cardiac tissues. Additionally, we identified the involvement of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway in the beneficial effects of HNG in isoproterenol-induced HF mice.

Despite conventional treatment, cardiac tissue engineering emerges as a potential alternative for the advancement and treatment of these patients, using biomaterials to replace or repair cardiac tissues.

Furthermore, gelatin has the ability to replace and perform collagen-like functions for cell development in vitro. The interest in using GelMA hydrogels combined with nanomaterials is increasingly growing to promote the responsiveness to external stimuli and improve certain properties of these hydrogels by exploring the incorporation of nanomaterials into these hydrogels to serve as electrical signaling conductive elements. This review highlights the applications of electrically conductive nanomaterials associated with GelMA hydrogels for the development of structures for cardiac tissue engineering, by focusing on studies that report the combination of GelMA with nanomaterials, such as gold and carbon derivatives (carbon nanotubes and graphene), in addition to the possibility of applying these materials in 3D tissue engineering, developing new possibilities for cardiac studies.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2023-12-04", "authors": ["Erika SLisboa", "CarineSerafim", "WanessaSantana", "Victoria L SDos Santos", "Ricardo L Cde Albuquerque-Junior", "Marco VChaud", "Juliana CCardoso", "SonaJain", "Patr\u00edciaSeverino", "Eliana BSouto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2023.11.056"}
{"title": "Mechanism of pro-MMP9 activation in co-culture of pro-inflammatory macrophages and cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "A wide range of cardiac diseases is associated with inflammation. \"Inflamed\" heart tissue is infiltrated with pro-inflammatory macrophages which extensively secrete matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), a regulator of extracellular matrix turnover. As MMP9 is released from macrophages in a latent form, it requires activation. The present study addresses the role of cardiomyocytes in the course of this activation process.\nIn mono- and co-cultures of pro-inflammatory rat macrophages (bone marrow-derived and peritoneal) and cardiomyocytes (H9C2 cell line) gelatin zymography demonstrated that activated macrophages robustly secreted latent pro-MMP9, whereas cardiomyocytes could not produce the enzyme. Co-culturing of the two cell species was critical for pro-MMP9 activation and was also accompanied by processing of cardiomyocyte-secreted pro-MMP2. A cascade of pro-MMP9 activation was initiated on macrophage membrane with pro-MMP2 cleavage. Namely, pro-inflammatory macrophages expressed an active membrane type 1 MMP (MT1MMP), which activated pro-MMP2, which in turn converted pro-MMP9. Downregulation of MT1MMP in macrophages by siRNA abolished activation of both pro-MMP2 and pro-MMP9 in co-culture. In addition, both cell species secreted MMP13 as a further pro-MMP9 activator. In co-culture, activation of pro-MMP13 occurred on membranes of macrophages and was enhanced in presence of active MMP2. Using incubations with recombinant MMPs and isolated macrophage membranes, we demonstrated that while both MMP2 and MMP13 individually had the ability to activate pro-MMP9, their combined action provided a synergistic effect.\nActivation of pro-MMP9 in a co-culture of pro-inflammatory macrophages and cardiomyocytes was the result of a complex interaction of several MMPs on the cell membrane and in the extracellular space. Both cell types contributed critically to pro-MMP9 processing.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2023-12-04", "authors": ["DmitryEgorov", "IrakliKopaliani", "Anne Klotzsche-vonAmeln", "StephanSpeier", "AndreasDeussen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2023.113868"}

To test the roles of SAN ECM in the PCM phenotype and function, we engineered reconstructed-SAN heart tissues (rSANHTs) by recellularizing porcine SAN ECMs with hiPSC-derived PCMs. The hiPSC-PCMs in rSANHTs self-organized into clusters resembling the native SAN and displayed higher expression of pacemaker-specific genes and a faster automaticity compared with PCMs in reconstructed-left ventricular heart tissues (rLVHTs). To test the protective nature of SAN ECMs under strain, rSANHTs and rLVHTs were transplanted onto the murine thoracic diaphragm to undergo constant cyclic strain. All strained-rSANHTs preserved automaticity, whereas 66% of strained-rLVHTs lost their automaticity. In contrast to the strained-rLVHTs, PCMs in strained-rSANHTs maintained high expression of key pacemaker genes (HCN4, TBX3, and TBX18).

However, the pathological mechanisms underlying HF are still not fully clear.\nIn this study, we performed proteomics and transcriptomics analyses on samples from human HF patients and healthy donors to obtain an overview of the detailed changes in protein and mRNA expression that occur during HF. We found substantial differences in protein expression changes between the atria and ventricles of myocardial tissues from patients with HF. Interestingly, the metabolic state of ventricular tissues was altered in HF samples, and inflammatory pathways were activated in atrial tissues. Through analysis of differentially expressed genes in HF samples, we found that several glutathione S-transferase (GST) family members, especially glutathione S-transferase M2-2 (GSTM2), were decreased in all the ventricular samples. Furthermore, GSTM2 overexpression effectively relieved the progression of cardiac hypertrophy in a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery-induced HF mouse model.

Subchronic exposure to fluoride has the potential to result in pathological damage to the heart, but its potential mechanism requires further investigation. This study investigated the effects of long-term exposure to sodium fluoride (0, 500, 1000, and 2000\u00a0mg/kg) on the hearts of chickens were investigated. The results showed that an elevated exposure dose of sodium fluoride led to congested cardiac tissue and disrupted myofiber organisation. Sodium fluoride exposure activated the ERS pathways of PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, increasing HSP60 and HSP70 and decreasing HSP90. The NF-\u03baB pathway and the activation of TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS elicited an inflammatory response. BAX, cytc, and cleaved-caspase3 were increased, triggering apoptosis and leading to cardiac injury. The abnormal expression of HSP90 and HSP70 affected the stability and function of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, which are crucial necroptosis markers. HSPs inhibited TNF-\u03b1-mediated necroptosis and apoptosis of the death receptor pathway. Sodium fluoride resulted in heart injury in chickens because of the ERS and variations in HSPs, inducing inflammation and apoptosis. Cardiac-adapted HSPs impeded the activation of necroptosis.

{"title": "Bridging the Translational Gap in Heart Failure Research: Using Human iPSC-derived Cardiomyocytes to Accelerate Therapeutic Insights.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence and burden. Despite extensive research, a cure for HF remains elusive. Traditionally, the study of HF's pathogenesis and therapies has relied heavily on animal experimentation. However, these models have limitations in recapitulating the full spectrum of human HF, resulting in challenges for clinical translation. To address this translational gap, research employing human cells, especially cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs), offers a promising solution. These cells facilitate the study of human genetic and molecular mechanisms driving cardiomyocyte dysfunction and pave the way for research tailored to individual patients. Further, engineered heart tissues combine hiPSC-CMs, other cell types, and scaffold-based approaches to improve cardiomyocyte maturation. Their tridimensional architecture, complemented with mechanical, chemical, and electrical cues, offers a more physiologically relevant environment. This review explores the advantages and limitations of conventional and innovative methods used to study HF pathogenesis, with a primary focus on ischemic HF due to its relative ease of modeling and clinical relevance. We emphasize the importance of a collaborative approach that integrates insights obtained in animal and hiPSC-CMs-based models, along with rigorous clinical research, to dissect the mechanistic underpinnings of human HF. Such an approach could improve our understanding of this disease and lead to more effective treatments.", "journal": "Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal", "date": "2023-11-29", "authors": ["LeslyeVenegas-Zamora", "MatthewFiedler", "WilliamPerez", "FranciscoAltamirano"], "doi": "10.14797/mdcvj.1295\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000485\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.04.006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.320257\n10.1007/978-1-62703-505-7_17\n10.3791/3896\n10.1161/01.cir.100.suppl_2.ii-340\n10.1152/ajpheart.00963.2003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.03.013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00720.2003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00082-9\n10.1002/ejhf.826\n10.1038/s41434-020-0171-7\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064513\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.320246\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.011\n10.1093/cvr/cvz161\n10.1152/ajpheart.00459.2021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035420\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa791\n10.1007/978-1-4939-8597-5_22\n10.1152/ajpheart.1980.239.4.H477\n10.3791/60392\n10.1152/ajpheart.00406.2019\n10.1073/pnas.95.6.2979\n10.1161/01.res.69.6.1476\n10.1016/0014-4827(76)90447-x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.03.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.12.007\n10.1152/ajpcell.00456.2007\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.789149\n10.1038/s41419-022-04533-1\n10.1093/cvr/cvz341\n10.1161/01.res.0000035254.80718.91\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.06.001\n10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100334\n10.1056/NEJMra072139\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.01.011\n10.1113/JP270953\n10.1093/stcltm/szac061\n10.1063/1.5000746\n10.1016/j.jmccpl.2022.100020\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.016\n10.1242/bio.052381\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa233\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1093/cvr/cvab115\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307580\n10.1021/acsami.2c07326\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311920\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.04.005\n10.1038/s41467-021-23329-z\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.08.013\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.10.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01006\n10.3389/fmolb.2020.00014\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.908848\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2018.0163\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2014.0376\n10.1159/000477436\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.913156\n10.1016/j.tice.2018.05.002\n10.1039/b915965g\n10.1152/ajpheart.00743.2011\n10.1242/dev.143966\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.034\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2018.0212\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.05.064"}

{"title": "Long-term Ovariectomy Reduces Tolerance of Rats to Myocardial Ischemia-reperfusion Injury.", "abstract": "The harmful impact of ovariectomy on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (M/IR) injury has been established in the short term.\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the long-term effects of ovariectomy on M/IR injury.\nTwo methods involving dorsolateral skin incisions were used to induce the ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. The rats were divided into 2 groups: Control and OVX (n = 6). At the end of the study, the hearts were isolated and subjected to global ischemia using the Langendorff apparatus. Cardiac function indices (CFIs) were recorded, including left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), peak rates of positive (+dp/dt) and negative (-dp/dt) changes in LV pressure, and LV-developed pressure (LVDP). At the end of the reperfusion period, the hearts were used to measure the size of the infarct, levels of nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), and mRNA expression of NO synthase (NOS) enzymes, including endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS).\nCompared to controls, OVX rats had larger infarct size by 51%, higher LVEDP by 29%, and lower recovery of +dp/dt, -dp/dt, and LVDP by 29%, 22%, and 35%, respectively. Furthermore, in heart tissue, rats that underwent OVX had significantly higher concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, and NOx by 79%, 82%, and 83%, respectively. Additionally, these rats had lower mRNA levels of eNOS by 38% and higher mRNA levels of iNOS by 71%.\nThe long-term deficiency of estrogen increased the expression of iNOS and decreased the expression of eNOS in the heart tissue of OVX rats. Imbalanced NOS expressions were associated with exacerbated responses to M/IR injury in OVX rats.", "journal": "International journal of endocrinology and metabolism", "date": "2023-11-29", "authors": ["NasibehYousefzadeh", "SajadJeddi"], "doi": "10.5812/ijem-135101\n10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00684-X\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(98)10279-9\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2415\n10.1007/s40618-015-0253-3\n10.2337/dc21-1107\n10.1161/01.hyp.25.4.848\n10.1161/01.cir.96.6.1953\n10.1152/ajpregu.2000.279.5.R1599\n10.2174/1874120701007010001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00037.2004\n10.1152/ajpregu.00071.2007\n10.34172/mj.2022.026\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.846402\n10.1002/dmrr.1176\n10.1016/j.jss.2005.06.038\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000224324.52466.e6\n10.1152/ajpheart.00596.2001\n10.1111/jfbc.14109\n10.1007/s00210-021-02129-8\n10.1155/2016/5057405\n10.1093/cvr/cvn086\n10.1038/s41684-021-00871-3\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000410\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2021.09.007\n10.17179/excli2019-1990\n10.1152/ajpendo.90248.2008\n10.1002/j.1550-8528.1993.tb00614.x\n10.1152/ajpendo.00638.2011\n10.1097/NT.0000000000000092\n10.1007/BF02980263\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2021.130060\n10.1007/s00424-017-2034-7\n10.1677/JOE-08-0071\n10.1253/circj.cj-12-1434\n10.3389/fendo.2018.00353\n10.1016/j.gene.2016.01.014\n10.1007/s11010-005-5779-9\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.110\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2004.11.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.5.H1567\n10.3791/52908"}

In the present study, we examined whether simvastatin administration inhibits the development of cardiac fibrosis in HFpEF model mice. We further examined the contribution of the Smad and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways to the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway in the development of HFpEF.\nHFpEF animals were prepared by feeding C57BL/6 N mice a high-fat diet and providing water containing N[w]-nitro-<sc>l</sc>-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (<sc>l</sc>-NAME) for 15 weeks. Simvastatin (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was administered orally daily during the experimental period.

Changes in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling proteins in myocardial tissue were examined by Western blotting.\nA high-fat diet and <sc>l</sc>-NAME solution load induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction with cardiac fibrosis. Simvastatin treatment markedly attenuated cardiac fibrosis and reduced cardiac diastolic dysfunction. In addition, simvastatin prevented the increase in phosphorylation levels of Smad (Smad2 and Smad3) and MAPK (c-Raf, Erk1/2) pathway proteins downstream of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor in cardiac tissue.\nOur present study demonstrated that simvastatin attenuated diastolic dysfunction by reducing cardiac fibrosis in HFpEF hearts.

We obtained high quality tissue samples under controlled conditions that reveal a level of cellular detail so far inaccessible in human studies.\nWe performed single nucleus RNA-sequencing in 78 samples in 10 distinct regions including the four chambers of the heart, ventricular septum, sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, aorta, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary veins (PV), which produced an aggregate map of 505,835 nuclei. We identified 26 distinct cell types and additional subtypes, including a number of rare cell types such as PV cardiomyocytes and non-myelinating Schwann cells (NMSCs), and unique groups of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts (FBs), which gave rise to a detailed cell type distribution across tissues. We demonstrated differences in the cellular composition across different cardiac regions and tissue-specific differences in transcription for each cell type, highlighting the molecular diversity and complex tissue architecture of the cardiovascular system. Specifically, we observed great transcriptional heterogeneities among ECs and FBs. Importantly, several cell subtypes had a unique regional localization such as a subtype of VSMCs enriched in the large vasculature.

However, this process requires multiple experimental attempts to select suitable electrospun properties and validate resulting mechanical responses. To overcome the time and cost constraints associated with this iterative procedure, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) can be applied using stable hyperelastic and viscoelastic models that describe the response of electrospun scaffolds under different conditions. In this study, we aim to create accurate simulations of the viscoelastic behavior of electrospun helical scaffolds. We fabricated helical fibers from Poly (3-caprolactone) (PCL) using the electrospinning process to achieve this. The electrospun samples were subjected to uniaxial deformation, and their response was modelled using existing hyperelastic and stress relaxation models. The simulations were built on experimental data for specific deformation speed and maximum strain conditions.

A Comprehensive Bioinformatic Analysis Utilizing Bulk and Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data with Machine Learning.", "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) emerges as a substantial contributor to various cardiovascular disorders, including ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking CKD and ICM remain elusive. Our study aims to unravel these connections by integrating publicly available bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Expression profiles from two ICM datasets obtained from heart tissue and one CKD with Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (CKD-PBMC) dataset were collected. We initiated by identifying shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ICM and CKD. Subsequent functional enrichment analysis shed light on the mechanisms connecting CKD to ICM. Machine learning algorithms enabled the identification of 13 candidate genes, including AGRN, COL16A1, COL1A2, FAP, FRZB, GPX3, ITIH5, NFASC, PTN, SLC38A1, STARD7, THBS2, and VPS35. Their expression patterns in ICM were investigated via scRNA-seq data analysis. Notably, most of them were enriched in fibroblasts. COL16A1, COL1A2, PTN, and FAP were enriched in scar-formation fibroblasts, while GPX3 and THBS2 showed enrichment in angiogenesis fibroblasts. A Gaussian na\u00efve Bayes model was developed for diagnosing CKD-related ICM, bolstered by SHapley Additive exPlanations interpretability and validated internally and externally. In conclusion, our investigation unveils the extracellular matrix's role in CKD and ICM interplay, identifies 13 candidate genes, and showcases their expression patterns in ICM.

{"title": "Nutritional Approach in Selected Inherited Metabolic Cardiac Disorders-A Concise Summary of Available Scientific Evidence.", "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IMDs) are a group of inherited diseases that manifest themselves through a myriad of signs and symptoms, including structural or functional cardiovascular damage. The therapy of these diseases is currently based on enzyme-replacement therapy, chaperone therapy or the administration of supplements and the establishment of personalized dietary plans. Starting from the major signs identified by the pediatric cardiologist that can indicate the presence of such a metabolic disease-cardiomyopathies, conduction disorders or valvular dysplasias-we tried to paint the portrait of dietary interventions that can improve the course of patients with mitochondrial diseases or lysosomal abnormalities. The choice of the two categories of inborn errors of metabolism is not accidental and reflects the experience and concern of the authors regarding the management of patients with such diagnoses. A ketogenic diet offers promising results in selected cases, although, to date, studies have failed to bring enough evidence to support generalized recommendations. Other diets have been successfully utilized in patients with IMDs, but their specific effect on the cardiac phenotype and function is not yet fully understood. Significant prospective studies are necessary in order to understand and establish which diet best suits every patient depending on the inherited metabolic disorder. The most suitable imagistic monitoring method for the impact of different diets on the cardiovascular system is still under debate, with no protocols yet available.

{"title": "Transcriptional Targeting Approaches in Cardiac Gene Transfer Using AAV Vectors.", "abstract": "Cardiac-targeted transgene delivery offers new treatment opportunities for cardiovascular diseases, which massively contribute to global mortality. Restricted gene transfer to cardiac tissue might protect extracardiac organs from potential side-effects. This could be mediated by using cis-regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers that act on the transcriptional level. Here, we discuss examples of tissue-specific promoters for targeted transcription in myocytes, cardiomyocytes, and chamber-specific cardiomyocytes. Some promotors are induced at pathological states, suggesting a potential use as \"induction-by-disease switches\" in gene therapy.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are capable of modulating macrophage plasticity, principally due to their immunoregulatory capacity. In the present study, we analyzed the capacity of MSCs to modulate macrophages derived from monocytes from patients with STEMI. We analyzed the circulating levels of cytokines associated with M1 and M2 macrophages in patients with STEMI, and the levels of cytokines associated with M1 macrophages were significantly higher in patients with STEMI than in controls. BM-MSCs facilitate the generation of M1 and M2 macrophages. M1 macrophages cocultured with MSCs did not have decreased M1 marker expression, but these macrophages had an increased expression of markers of the M2 macrophage phenotype (CD14, CD163 and CD206) and IL-10 and IL-1Ra signaling-induced regulatory T cells (Tregs). M2 macrophages from patients with STEMI had an increased expression of M2 phenotypic markers in coculture with BM-MSCs, as well as an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and an increased generation of Tregs.

In this investigation, we studied the capacity of rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (r-AdMSCs) and decellularized porcine pericardium (DPP) to restore heart functions in MI animals. MI was induced in four different groups, three of which were treated either using DPP (MI-DPP group), stem cells (MI-SC group), or both (MI-SC/DPP group). Cardiac functions of these groups and the Sham group were evaluated using echocardiography, the intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG) on weeks 2 and 4, and intraventricular hemodynamics on week 4. On day 31, the animals were euthanized for histological analysis. Echocardiographic, IVPG and hemodynamic findings indicated that the three treatment strategies shared effectively in the regeneration process.

{"title": "Detergent-Based Decellularization for Anisotropic Cardiac-Specific Extracellular Matrix Scaffold Generation.", "abstract": "Cell-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) has become increasingly popular in tissue engineering applications due to its ability to provide tailored signals for desirable cellular responses. Anisotropic cardiac-specific ECM scaffold decellularized from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiac fibroblasts (hiPSC-CFs) mimics the native cardiac microenvironment and provides essential biochemical and signaling cues to hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of two detergent-based decellularization methods: (1) a combination of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate (EDTA + SDS) and (2) a combination of sodium deoxycholate and deoxyribonuclease (SD + DNase), in preserving the composition and bioactive substances within the aligned ECM scaffold while maximumly removing cellular components. The decellularization effects were evaluated by characterizing the ECM morphology, quantifying key structural biomacromolecules, and measuring preserved growth factors.

Unfortunately, DIC remains difficult to manage due to an ignorance regarding pathophysiological mechanisms. Our work aimed to evaluate the role of HSP47 in doxorubicin-induced HF, and to explore the molecular mechanisms.\nMice were exposed to multi-intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (DOX, 4mg/kg/week, for 6\u00a0weeks continuously) to produce DIC. HSP47 expression was significantly upregulated in serum and in heart tissue in DOX-treated mice and in isolated cardiomyocytes. Mice with cardiac-specific HSP47 overexpression and knockdown were generated using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAVV9) injection. Importantly, cardiac-specific HSP47 overexpression exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in DIC, while HSP47 knockdown prevented DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, cardiac atrophy and fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we identified that HSP47 directly interacted with IRE1\u03b1 in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we provided powerful evidence that HSP47-IRE1\u03b1 complex promoted TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome and reinforced USP1-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination. Moreover, NLRP3 deficiency in vivo conspicuously abolished HSP47-mediated cardiac atrophy and fibrogenesis under DOX condition.\nHSP47 was highly expressed in serum and cardiac tissue after doxorubicin administration. HSP47 contributed to long-term anthracycline chemotherapy-associated cardiac dysfunction in an NLRP3-dependent manner.

{"title": "Intervention of Tanshinone IIA on the PGK1-PDHK1 Pathway to Reprogram Macrophage Phenotype After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction remains a disease with high morbidity and death rate among cardiovascular diseases. Macrophages are abundant immune cells in the heart. Under different stimulatory factors, macrophages can differentiate into different phenotypes and play a dual pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory role. Therefore, a potential strategy for the treatment of myocardial infarction is to regulate the energy metabolism of macrophages and thereby regulate the polarization of macrophages. Tan IIA is an effective liposolubility component extracted from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza and plays an important role in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. On this basis, this study proposed whether Tan IIA could affect phenotype changes by regulating energy metabolism of macrophages, and thus exert its potential in the treatment of MI.\nEstablishing a myocardial infarction model, Tan IIA was given for 3 days and 7 days for intervention. Cardiac function was detected by echocardiography, and cardiac pathological sections of each group were stained with HE and Masson to observe the inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis area after administration. The expression and secretion of inflammatory factors in heart tissue and serum of each group, as well as the proportion of macrophages at the myocardial infarction site, were detected using RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence. The mitochondrial function of macrophages was evaluated using JC-1, calcium ion concentration detection, reactive oxygen species detection, and mitochondrial electron microscopic analysis. Mechanically, single-cell transcriptome data mining, cell transcriptome sequencing, and molecular docking technology were used to anchor the target of Tan IIA and enrich the pathways to explore the mechanism of Tan IIA regulating macrophage energy metabolism and phenotype. The target of Tan IIA was further determined by gene knockdown and overexpression assay.\nThe intervention of Tan IIA can improve the cardiac function, inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis after MI, reduce the expression of inflammatory factors in the heart, enhance the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, increase the proportion of M2-type macrophages, reduce the proportion of M1-type macrophages, and promote tissue repair, suggesting that Tan IIA has pharmacological effects in the treatment of MI. In terms of mechanism, RNA-seq results suggest that the phenotype of macrophages is strongly correlated with energy metabolism, and Tan IIA can regulate the PGK1-PDHK1 signaling pathway, change the energy metabolism mode of macrophages, and then affect its phenotype.\nTan IIA regulates the energy metabolism of macrophages and changes its phenotype through the PGK1-PDHK1 signaling pathway, thus playing a role in improving MI.", "journal": "Cardiovascular drugs and therapy", "date": "2023-11-22", "authors": ["ShanGao", "ZhihuiYang", "DanLi", "BingkaiWang", "XuZheng", "ChongLi", "GuanweiFan"], "doi": "10.1007/s10557-023-07520-6\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.10.001\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.009\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv484\n10.1016/j.febslet.2013.05.012\n10.1038/326501a0\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1002243\n10.1002/hep.28887\n10.1038/s41467-019-13601-8\n10.4049/jimmunol.1402469\n10.1002/smtd.202100752\n10.1089/ars.2019.7947\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.041\n10.2147/DDDT.S266911\n10.3892/ijmm.2021.4991\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.09.014\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223925\n10.1016/j.jep.2016.10.025\n10.1113/JP274959\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2016.06.006\n10.1152/physrev.00001.2015\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.057549\n10.1111/febs.15715\n10.1038/nature11986\n10.1101/196857\n10.3390/ijms221910371\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314357\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314028\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303204\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.04.008\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.1038/s41569-022-00823-5\n10.1038/s41467-022-30757-y\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319737\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfr173\n10.1016/j.molcel.2016.02.009\n10.1016/j.molcel.2019.08.006"}

Biodegradable polymers provide a promising alternative for cardiovascular implants by conferring therapeutic function and eliminating long-term complications, but inducing in situ cardiac tissue regeneration remains a substantial clinical challenge. PGAG (polydioxanone/poly (l-lactic acid)-gelatin-A5G81) occluders are prepared by covalently conjugating biomolecules composed of gelatin and layer adhesive protein-derived peptides (A5G81) to the surface of polydioxanone and poly (l-lactic acid) fibers. The polymer microfiber-biomacromolecule-peptide frame with biophysical and biochemical cues could orchestrate the biomaterial-host cell interactions, by recruiting endogenous endothelial cells, promoting their adhesion and proliferation, and polarizing immune cells into anti-inflammatory phenotypes and augmenting the release of reparative cytokines. In a porcine atrial septal defect (ASD) model, PGAG occluders promote in situ tissue regeneration by accelerating surface endothelialization and regulating immune response, which mitigate inflammation and fibrosis formation, and facilitate the fusion of occluder with surrounding heart tissue.

Some studies reported that Dengzhanshengmai (DZSM) capsule may improve HF, but its mechanisms are unclear. This study attempts to determine the function of DZSM in treating HF and investigates its potential mechanism. We demonstrated that DZSM can considerably reduce systemic inflammation, improve intestinal barrier functions and enhance cardiac functions in HF rats. Further investigations displayed that the beneficial effects of DZSM were related to the reduction of gut microbiota metabolite phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) levels in serum and heart tissue. In addition, we demonstrated that PAGln can exacerbate the severity of HF in rats, and the serum PAGln levels in HF patients were higher than in healthy subjects. Moreover, by using microbial sequencing, we found that DZSM could alter the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota in HF rats, including decreased relative abundance of Turicibacter and Turicibacter_sp.TS3, and regulated the gene expression of PAGln synthesis-related enzymes. Therefore, our findings have contributed novel perspectives on the involvement of DZSM in treating HF, specifically in its regulation of intestinal flora and associated detrimental metabolites.

We used a rat model of heterotopic heart transplantation (HTx) to mimic ventricular assist device support and heart unloading.\nHiCTs were created by inserting gelatin hydrogel microspheres between cell sheets made from hiPSC-derived cardiovascular cells. Male athymic nude rats underwent myocardial infarction (MI) and were divided into the following groups: MI (loaded, untreated control), MI\u00a0+\u00a0HTx (unloaded, untreated control), MI\u00a0+\u00a0HTx\u00a0+\u00a0HiCT (unloaded, treated), and MI\u00a0+\u00a0HiCT (loaded, treated).

{"title": "Arsenic-Induced Cardiovascular Diseases and their Correlation with Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number, Deletion, and Telomere Length in Bangladeshi Population.", "abstract": "Arsenic contamination is a global health concern, primarily through contaminated groundwater and its entry into the food chain. The association between arsenic exposure and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is particularly alarming due to CVDs being the leading cause of death worldwide.

We aimed to determine whether arsenic exposure alters telomere length and mtDNAcn and deletion in a total of 50 CVD patients who underwent open heart surgery hailed from known arsenic-affected and unaffected areas in Bangladesh. Amount of arsenic was determined from the collected nails and cardiac tissues. Relative telomere length and mtDNAcn and deletion were quantified by qRT-PCR. The patients from arsenic-contaminated areas had higher average arsenic deposits in their fingers and toenails (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and higher cardiac tissue injury scores (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

In this study, a biohybrid scaffold of the decellularized caprine pericardium (DCP) and graphene oxide (GO) was fabricated by an immersion coating technique. The antimicrobial activity of GO was evaluated against Escherichia coli and showed minimum inhibitory concentration at 125\u2009\u03bcg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration at 250\u2009\u03bcg/mL. The presence of GO on the surface of the biohybrid GO-DCP was confirmed through SEM analysis. The existence of glycosaminoglycan, elastin, and collagen in the DCP and GO-DCP was inferred from the FTIR spectra. The biocompatibility of GO-DCP was studied by seeding valvular interstitial cells, and the results show GO coating supports cell adhesion on the serous and fibrous sides of the DCP. Further, the biomechanical response of DCP is unaltered by the presence of GO.

{"title": "Integrated Proteomics Identifies Troponin I Isoform Switch as a Regulator of a Sarcomere-Metabolism Axis During Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes have limited proliferative potential, and after myocardial infarction (MI), injured cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a regenerative capacity governed by cardiomyocyte proliferation; however, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal development results in loss of this regenerative capacity. Interestingly, a sarcomere isoform switch also takes place during postnatal development where slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) is replaced with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we first employ integrated quantitative bottom-up and top-down proteomics to comprehensively define the proteomic and sarcomeric landscape during postnatal heart maturation. Utilizing a cardiomyocyte-specific ssTnI transgenic mouse model, we found that ssTnI overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac regenerative capacity of the postnatal heart following MI compared to control mice by histological analysis. Our global proteomic analysis of ssTnI transgenic mice following MI reveals that ssTnI overexpression induces a significant shift in the cardiac proteomic landscape. This shift is characterized by an upregulation of key proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that the postnatal TnI isoform switch may play a role in the metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal maturation.

{"title": "3D reconstruction of murine mitochondria reveals changes in structure during aging linked to the MICOS complex.", "abstract": "During aging, muscle gradually undergoes sarcopenia, the loss of function associated with loss of mass, strength, endurance, and oxidative capacity. However, the 3D structural alterations of mitochondria associated with aging in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissues are not well described. Although mitochondrial aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial capacity, the genes responsible for the morphological changes in mitochondria during aging are poorly characterized. We measured changes in mitochondrial morphology in aged murine gastrocnemius, soleus, and cardiac tissues using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy and 3D reconstructions. We also used reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR, transmission electron microscopy quantification, Seahorse analysis, and metabolomics and lipidomics to measure changes in mitochondrial morphology and function after loss of mitochondria contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex genes, Chchd3, Chchd6, and Mitofilin. We identified significant changes in mitochondrial size in aged murine gastrocnemius, soleus, and cardiac tissues. We found that both age-related loss of the MICOS complex and knockouts of MICOS genes in mice altered mitochondrial morphology. Given the critical role of mitochondria in maintaining cellular metabolism, we characterized the metabolomes and lipidomes of young and aged mouse tissues, which showed profound alterations consistent with changes in membrane integrity, supporting our observations of age-related changes in muscle tissues. We found a relationship between changes in the MICOS complex and aging. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that underlie the tissue-dependent 3D mitochondrial phenotypic changes that occur in aging and the evolutionary conservation of these mechanisms between Drosophila and mammals.", "journal": "Aging cell", "date": "2023-11-14", "authors": ["ZerVue", "EdgarGarza-Lopez", "KitNeikirk", "PrasannaKatti", "LarryVang", "HeatherBeasley", "JianqiangShao", "Andrea GMarshall", "AmberCrabtree", "Alexandria CMurphy", "Brenita CJenkins", "PraveenaPrasad", "ChantellEvans", "BrittanyTaylor", "MargaretMungai", "MasonKillion", "DominiqueStephens", "Trace AChristensen", "JacobLam", "BenjaminRodriguez", "Mark APhillips", "NastaranDaneshgar", "Ho-JinKoh", "AliceKoh", "JamaineDavis", "NinaDevine", "MohammadSaleem", "Estev\u00e3oScudese", "Kenneth RyanArnold", "ValeriaVanessa Chavarin", "RyanDaniel Robinson", "MoumitaChakraborty", "Jennifer AGaddy", "Mariya TSweetwyne", "GenesisWilson", "ElmaZaganjor", "JamesKezos", "CristianaDondi", "Anilkumar KReddy", "BrianGlancy", "AnnetKirabo", "Anita MQuintana", "Dao-FuDai", "KarenOcorr", "Sandra AMurray", "Steven MDamo", "VernatExil", "BlakeRiggs", "Bret CMobley", "Jose AGomez", "Melanie RMcReynolds", "AntentorHinton"], "doi": "10.1111/acel.14009\n10.1002/adbi.202200202\n10.3389/fmolb.2023.906606\n10.3389/fnmol.2020.00041\n10.1002/adbi.202200221\n10.1093/micmic/ozad067.617\n10.1152/ajpheart.00202.2023"}

This investigation elucidates the influence of 20(S)-Rh2 on Ang-II-induced heart failure and cardiac alterations.\nAng-II was administered in C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks to induce HHF. In the last 2 weeks of treatment, 20(S)-Rh2 was orally administered in mice to assess the potential 20(S)-Rh2 mechanism. Subsequently, RNA sequencing was carried out.\nIt was indicated that 20(S)-Rh2 suppresses myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy, and inflammation, thereby inhibiting cardiac disruption in Ang-II-challenged mice without affecting blood pressure. According to the RNA sequencing data, this cardio-protective effect was linked with the (JNK)/AP 1 pathway. 20(S)-Rh2 alleviated heart tissue and cardiomyocytes inflammation by inhibiting the Ang-II-mediated JNK/AP-1 pathway. Within cardiomyocytes, JNK or AP-1 absence abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of 20(S)-Rh2.\nThis study investigation indicated that 20(S)-Rh2 prevents cardiovascular dysfunction induced by Ang-II induced by decreasing JNK-regulated inflammatory responses, providing evidence for its use as an efficient regimen for HHF.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2023-11-13", "authors": ["TianxiangYu", "JiachenXu", "QinyanWang", "XueHan", "YuTu", "YiWang", "WuLuo", "MengyangWang", "GuangLiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115880"}

This study explored the effects of testosterone enanthate (TE) on the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as biomarkers of oxidative stress in the cardiac tissue of rats that were treated with TE. Also, we evaluated the levels of collagen deposition as a marker for cardiac fibrosis and the mRNA expression of the Wnt-2 and dickkopf1 (DKK1) as potential factors that may be involved in the increase of collagen deposition. In this study, 21 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n=7): CO: controls; T-T: normal rats that were treated with 25 mg/kg/day TE for 2 weeks and served as an androgen abuse model; V-T: these animals were treated with the sesame oil as a solvent of TE. At the end of treatment, the relative mRNA expression of Wnt-2 and DKK1 in the ventricular tissue was determined by q-RT-PCR. The degree of collagen deposition in the myocardial tissue was evaluated by Masson's trichrome staining. Results showed that the mRNA expression of DKK1 was down-regulated following excess androgen exposure (p=0.009) but Wnt-2 mRNA expression wasn't affected (p=0.069). Increased collagen deposition was observed in the T-T group (p=0.000). The levels of MDA and TAC in heart tissue weren't altered significantly (p>0.05). These results suggest that the raised collagen deposition by exogenous testosterone may be mediated, at least in part, by the reduction of expression of DKK1 mRNA.

{"title": "Dynamic control of contractile resistance to iPSC-derived micro-heart muscle arrays.", "abstract": "Many types of cardiovascular disease are linked to the mechanical forces placed on the heart. However, our understanding of how mechanical forces exactly affect the cellular biology of the heart remains incomplete. In vitro models based on cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CM) enable researchers to develop medium to high-throughput systems to study cardiac mechanobiology at the cellular level. Previous models have been developed to enable the study of mechanical forces, such as cardiac afterload. However, most of these models require exogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) to form cardiac tissues. Recently, a system was developed to simulate changes in afterload by grafting ECM-free micro-heart muscle arrays to elastomeric substrates of discrete stiffnesses. In the present study, we extended this system by combining the elastomer-grafted tissue arrays with a magnetorheological elastomeric substrate.

{"title": "Jingfang Granule mitigates Coxsackievirus B3-induced myocardial damage by modulating mucolipin 1 expression.", "abstract": "Jingfang Granules (JFG) originate from the traditional herbal formula Jingfang Baidu powder. It has the effects of inducing sweating and dispelling wind. It is a classic medication used for treating external pathogenic factors and viral diseases. However, the therapeutic mechanism of JFG for viral myocarditis needs further clarification.\nThis study aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of JFG on coxsackievirus B3-induced viral myocarditis (VMC), along with the elucidation of its underlying mechanisms.\nC57 BL/6JNifdc mice were divided randomly into several groups: control, model, Jingfang Granule groups (0.23, 0.46, and 0.69\u00a0g/20g, respectively), and a positive group (oseltamivir, 19.33\u00a0mg/kg). Following the establishment of the VMC model, the mice underwent an 8 -week treatment regimen. Pathological alterations in cardiac tissues and inflammatory protein expression were monitored. Differential gene analysis was conducted utilizing transcriptomic techniques. The differential gene mucolipin 1 (Mcoln1) was knocked down by transfection with siRNA in H9C2 cell, and investigative techniques such as immunoblotting, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, JC-1 staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, and mitochondrial stress testing were employed to examine its mechanism of action.\nJFG significantly mitigates the pathological damage observed in the cardiac tissues of CVB3-induced VMC mice and attenuates the expression of inflammatory genes. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes are identified through transcriptomic analysis and validated via PCR. Among these, the upregulation of Mcoln1 promotes autophagy, facilitating the clearance of damaged mitochondria and excessive ROS. This has been substantiated through in vitro experiments. Excessive ROS precipitates a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, instigating cell apoptosis. In accordance with TUNEL staining results, JFG acts to inhibit cell apoptosis. To ascertain whether Mcoln1 is a crucial target for JFG in treating VMC, Mcoln1 was suppressed in H9C2 cells. The suppression of Mcoln1 hinders the elevation in autophagy levels post-JFG treatment, obstructs the enhancement of mitochondrial function, and impedes the clearance of ROS. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of JFG on cell apoptosis is attenuated.\nThe research findings indicate that JFG has a protective effect on CVB3-induced H9C2 cell injury. JFG may exert its effects in VMC treatment by enhancing autophagy to suppress cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, thereby counteracting cell damage.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2023-11-12", "authors": ["BowenSun", "LinLin", "TianYao", "JingchunYao", "GuiminZhang", "YunlunLi", "ChaoLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2023.117396"}

This highlights the significance of assessing the impact of COC on promoting coagulation and endothelial activation in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Sprague Dawley rats.\nTwenty (20) five-weeks-old female Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 150 and 200g were subjected to both LFD and HFD-feeding for 8-weeks to determine its influence on basic metabolic status, hemostatic profile, hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure and heart rate), as well as selected biomarkers of coagulation (tissue factor and D-dimer) and endothelial activation (Von Willebrand factor and nitric oxide). Thereafter HFD-fed animals were treated with receive high dose combined oral contraceptive (HCOC) and low dose combine oral contraceptive (LCOC) for 6 weeks.\nOur results showed that beyond weight gain, HFD-feeding was associated with hyperglycemia, increased mean arterial pressure, and reduced nitric oxide levels when compared with LFD group (p<0.05). Interestingly, treatment with high dose of COC for 6-weeks did not significantly alter atherothrombotic markers (p>0.05). However, this study is not without limitation as regulation of these markers remains to be confirmed within the cardiac tissues or endothelial cells of these animals.\nHFD-feeding orchestrate the concomitant release of pro-coagulants and endothelial activation markers in rats leading to haemostatic imbalance and endothelial dysfunction. Short-term treatment with COC shows no detrimental effects in these HFD-fed rats. Although in terms of clinical relevance, our findings depict the notion that the risk of CVD in association with COC may depend on the dosage and duration of use among other factors especially in certain conditions.

{"title": "Abnormal expression of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rat models.", "abstract": "Sphingolipids exert important roles within the cardiovascular system and related diseases. Perturbed sphingolipid metabolism was previously reported in cerebral and renal tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Specific defects related to the synthesis of sphingolipids and to the metabolism of Sphingosine-1-Phospahte (S1P) were exclusively identified in the stroke-prone (SHRSP) with the respect to the stroke-resistant (SHRSR) strain. In this study, we explored any existing perturbation in either protein or gene expression of enzymes involved in the sphingolipid pathways in cardiac tissue from both SHRSP and SHRSR strains, compared to the normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) strain. The two hypertensive rat models showed an overall perturbation of the expression of different enzymes involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the heart. In particular, whereas the expression of the S1P-metabolizing-enzyme, SPHK2, was significantly reduced in both SHR strains, SGPL1 protein levels were decreased only in SHRSP. The protein levels of S1P receptors 1-3 were reduced only in the cardiac tissue of SHRSP, whereas S1PR2 levels were reduced in both SHR strains. The de novo synthesis of sphingolipids was aberrant in the two hypertensive strains. A significant reduction of mRNA expression of the Sgms1 and Smpd3 enzymes, implicated in the metabolism of sphingomyelin, was found in both hypertensive strains. Interestingly, Smpd2, devoted to sphingomyelin degradation, was reduced only in the heart of SHRSP. In conclusion, alterations in the expression of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes may be involved in the susceptibility to cardiac damage of hypertensive rat strains.

Despite the effectiveness of contemporary medical interventions in mitigating CVD-related fatality rates and complications, their efficacy remains curtailed by an array of limitations. These include the suboptimal efficiency of direct cell injection and an inherent disequilibrium between the demand and availability of heart transplantations. Consequently, the imperative to formulate innovative strategies for cardiac regeneration therapy becomes unmistakable. Within this context, 3D bioprinting technology emerges as a vanguard contender, occupying a pivotal niche in the realm of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This state-of-the-art methodology holds the potential to fabricate intricate heart tissues endowed with multifaceted structures and functionalities, thereby engendering substantial promise. By harnessing the prowess of 3D bioprinting, it becomes plausible to synthesize functional cardiac architectures seamlessly enmeshed with the host tissue, affording a viable avenue for the restitution of infarcted domains and, by extension, mitigating the onerous yoke of CVDs. In this review, we encapsulate the myriad applications of 3D bioprinting technology in the domain of heart tissue regeneration.

Here we explore the use of Living Myocardial Slices (LMS) as a platform for nucleic acid-based therapies. Rat LMS and Adeno-Associated viruses (AAV) were used to optimise and analyse gene transfer efficiency, viability, tissue functionality, and cell tropism in cardiac tissue. Human cardiac tissue from failing (dilated cardiomyopathy) hearts was also used to validate the model in a more translational setting. LMS were cultured at physiological sarcomere length for 72-h under electrical stimulation. Two recombinant AAV serotypes (AAV6 and AAV9) at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were added to the surface of rat LMS. AAV6 at 20,000 MOI proved to be the most suitable serotype without affecting LMS contractility or kinetics and showing high transduction and penetrability efficiency in rat LMS. This serotype exhibited 40% of transduction efficiency in cardiomyocytes and stromal cells while 20% of the endothelial cells were transduced.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important regulators in a number of cardiac disorders. However, the role of circHDAC9 in myocardial I/R injury has not been clarified.\nHuman cardiac myocytes (HCMs) were treated with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and mice were subjected to I/R. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze the expression of circHDAC9, miR-671-5p, and SOX4, and western blot was used to detect SOX4 protein.

{"title": "Contractility measurements for cardiotoxicity screening with ventricular myocardial slices of pigs.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity is one major reason why drugs do not enter or are withdrawn from the market. Thus, approaches are required to predict cardiotoxicity with high specificity and sensitivity. Ideally, such methods should be performed within intact cardiac tissue with high relevance for humans and detect acute and chronic side effects on electrophysiological behaviour, contractility, and tissue structure in an unbiased manner. Herein, we evaluate healthy pig myocardial slices and biomimetic cultivation setups (BMCS) as a new cardiotoxicity screening approach.\nPig left ventricular samples were cut into slices and spanned into BMCS with continuous electrical pacing and online force recording. Automated stimulation protocols were established to determine the force-frequency relationship (FFR), frequency dependence of contraction duration, effective refractory period (ERP), and pacing threshold. Slices generated 1.3 \u00b1 0.14 mN/mm2 force at 0.5 Hz electrical pacing and showed a positive FFR and a shortening of contraction duration with increasing pacing rates. Approximately 62% of slices were able to contract for at least 6 days while showing stable ERP, contraction duration-frequency relationship, and preserved cardiac structure confirmed by confocal imaging and X-ray diffraction analysis. We used specific blockers of the most important cardiac ion channels to determine which analysis parameters are influenced. To validate our approach, we tested five drug candidates selected from the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay list as well as acetylsalicylic acid and DMSO as controls in a blinded manner in three independent laboratories. We were able to detect all arrhythmic drugs and their respective mode of action on cardiac tissue including inhibition of Na+, Ca2+, and hERG channels as well as Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.\nWe systematically evaluate this approach for cardiotoxicity screening, which is of high relevance for humans and can be upscaled to medium-throughput screening. Thus, our approach will improve the predictive value and efficiency of preclinical cardiotoxicity screening.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2023-11-07", "authors": ["RunzhuShi", "MariusReichardt", "Dominik JFiegle", "Linda KK\u00fcpfer", "TitusCzajka", "ZhengwuSun", "TimSalditt", "AndreasDendorfer", "ThomasSeidel", "TobiasBruegmann"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvad141\n10.3791/63964"}

Injectable biomaterials have emerged as a promising solution for cardiac tissue repair after MI. In this study, we designed a smart multifunctional carrier that could meet the treatment needs of different MI pathological processes by programmatically releasing different therapeutic substances. The carrier could respond to inflammatory microenvironment in the early stage of MI with rapid release of curcumin (Cur), and then sustained release recombinant humanized collagen type III (rhCol III) to treat MI. The rapid release of Cur reduced inflammation and apoptosis in the early stages, while the sustained release of rhCol III promoted angiogenesis and cardiac repair in the later stages. In vitro and in vivo results suggested that the multifunctional carrier could effectively improve cardiac function, promote the repair of infarcted tissue, and inhibit ventricular remodeling by reducing cell apoptosis and inflammation, and promoting angiogenesis in the different pathological processes of MI.

{"title": "Advancements in Heart Failure Management: A Comprehensive Narrative Review of Emerging Therapies.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a substantial and escalating global health challenge, affecting millions worldwide. This complex syndrome arises from diverse etiologies, encompassing ischemic heart disease, hypertension, valvular abnormalities, and cardiomyopathies. Heart failure is characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood efficiently to meet the body's metabolic demands, leading to debilitating symptoms, frequent hospitalizations, and high mortality rates. Traditionally, the management of Heart failure has focused on alleviating symptoms, reducing fluid retention, and enhancing cardiac contractility. These goals have been achieved through a combination of pharmacological therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics, often complemented by device-based interventions like implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy. However, despite these advances, the relentless progression of heart failure remains a significant clinical challenge. Neurohormonal activation, cardiac fibrosis, and cellular remodeling are just a few of the intricate processes contributing to the disease's progression. In recent years, researchers and clinicians have embarked on a quest to identify novel therapeutic approaches that address these underlying mechanisms. One such avenue of exploration involves the revolutionary field of gene therapy, with promising gene-editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, offering potential routes for correcting genetic mutations that contribute to heart failure. Additionally, regenerative medicine approaches, including stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, hold significant promise for repairing damaged cardiac tissue and restoring function. Furthermore, precision medicine initiatives have gained traction, aiming to tailor heart failure therapies to individual patient profiles, taking into account genetics, biomarkers, and comorbidities. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning in heart failure management has also enabled the development of predictive models for early intervention, risk stratification, and personalized treatment recommendations. This narrative review navigates the intricate landscape of emerging therapies for heart failure, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize the field by targeting the disease's fundamental mechanisms. By exploring these innovative approaches, we aspire to provide a comprehensive perspective on the evolving paradigm of heart failure\u00a0management, fostering a hopeful outlook for patients and clinicians alike.", "journal": "Cureus", "date": "2023-11-06", "authors": ["FnuSapna", "FnuRaveena", "MariaChandio", "KaroonaBai", "MohammadSayyar", "GiustinoVarrassi", "MahimaKhatri", "SateshKumar", "TamamMohamad"], "doi": "10.7759/cureus.46486"}

{"title": "Prioritizing cardiovascular disease-associated variants altering NKX2-5 and TBX5 binding through an integrative computational approach.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide and are heavily influenced by genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies have mapped >90% of CVD-associated variants within the noncoding genome, which can alter the function of regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors (TFs). However, due to the overwhelming number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (>500,000) in genome-wide association studies, prioritizing variants for in vitro analysis remains challenging. In this work, we implemented a computational approach that considers support vector machine (SVM)-based TF binding site classification and cardiac expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to identify and prioritize potential CVD-causing SNPs. We identified 1535 CVD-associated SNPs within TF footprints and putative cardiac enhancers plus 14,218 variants in linkage disequilibrium with genotype-dependent gene expression in cardiac tissues. Using ChIP-seq data from two cardiac TFs (NKX2-5 and TBX5) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, we trained a large-scale gapped k-mer SVM model to identify CVD-associated SNPs that altered NKX2-5 and TBX5 binding. The model was tested by scoring human heart TF genomic footprints within putative enhancers and measuring in vitro binding through electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Five variants predicted to alter NKX2-5 (rs59310144, rs6715570, and rs61872084) and TBX5 (rs7612445 and rs7790964) binding were prioritized for in vitro validation based on the magnitude of the predicted change in binding and are in cardiac tissue eQTLs.

Aconite, a traditional Chinese herb renowned for its cardiovascular benefits, holds promise in treating heart ailments. However, the mechanisms underlying its anti-fibrotic effects, particularly in cardiac fibrosis, remain elusive.\nThis study aims to shed light on aconite's potential as an anti-fibrotic agent and elucidate its mechanisms in a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis.\nBy inducing cardiac fibrosis through ISO injection, the study investigates the role of decoction of white aconite (DWA) in mitigating fibrotic processes. Techniques including metabolomics, RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence were employed to unveil the molecular changes induced by DWA.\nDWA exhibited a remarkable reduction in echocardiographic parameters, cardiac weight increase, myocardial infarction extent, inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition in heart tissue, and serum CK-MB, cTnT, cTnI levels post ISO injection. Metabolomic analysis unveiled DWA's modulation of 27 metabolites, especially in galactose metabolism, addressing metabolic disturbances in cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, DWA suppressed mRNA expression of fibrosis markers (Collagen I, CTGF, TGF-\u03b2), inhibited protein levels of MMP-9, \u03b1-SMA, and Galectin-3, while elevating TIMP1 expression.\nDWA demonstrated potent anti-fibrotic effects by curbing collagen deposition and alleviating metabolic disruptions in cardiac fibrosis via the galactose metabolism pathway, possibly mediated by the Gal-3/TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2023-11-05", "authors": ["ZiweiXing", "ChaoYang", "YaqianFeng", "JunyaoHe", "ChengPeng", "DanLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2023.155112"}
{"title": "Non-coding RNA-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human diabetic cardiomyopathy, potential regulation by DNA methylation.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication of diabetes and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction is central to DCM, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a key form of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. EndMT in DCM has been well-studied in model systems and has been found to be epigenetically regulated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, EndMT in DCM and its associated epigenetic changes need further characterization in human patients. It is also not known if ncRNAs are affected by changes in DNA methylation in DCM. This study aims to confirm in human hearts, the findings from animal and cell studies, and potentially provide novel insight into interactions between DNA methylation and ncRNAs in EndMT in DCM.\nHeart tissues were collected from autopsy patients, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Thin sections from paraffin-embedded tissues were used for histology and immunofluorescence analyses, where we confirmed that diabetic patients showed increased cardiac fibrosis that EndMT had occurred. Tissue curls from the paraffin-embedded tissues were used for RT-qPCR and methylation analyses. RT-qPCR quantitatively showed that EndMT occurs in the hearts of diabetics, and that EndMT in human hearts corresponded to changes in key ncRNAs. Methylation analysis showed that some of the EndMT-related ncRNAs were regulated by DNA promoter methylation, while others may be regulated through different epigenetic mechanisms.\nWe show that EndMT is a relevant pathological process in human hearts during DCM, and that its occurrence coincides with changes in relevant ncRNAs. We further find that interplay between DNA methylation and certain ncRNAs involved in the regulation of EndMT may contribute to the observed changes in ncRNA expression. These findings reinforce the role of EndMT in patients afflicted with DCM and underscore the complexities and importance of the interactions between different facets of epigenetic regulation.", "journal": "Cardiovascular diabetology", "date": "2023-11-04", "authors": ["EricWang", "ShaliChen", "HonglinWang", "ToriChen", "SubrataChakrabarti"], "doi": "10.1186/s12933-023-02039-4\n10.1161/JAHA.118.011295\n10.1007/s00125-017-4390-4\n10.4239/wjd.v10.i10.490\n10.1016/j.metabol.2021.154910\n10.2337/diabetes.54.6.1615\n10.1007/s11154-012-9232-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.2337/db15-1033\n10.1371/journal.pone.0276076\n10.3389/fendo.2023.1050540\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314813\n10.1152/physrev.00021.2018\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00747\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.311276\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00294\n10.3389/fcell.2021.683594\n10.3132/dvdr.2007.025\n10.1167/iovs.14-15167\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.938217\n10.3389/fmicb.2017.02483\n10.1038/npp.2012.112\n10.1093/cvr/cvr097\n10.1038/s41580-020-00315-9\n10.1186/1741-7007-11-59\n10.3389/fendo.2018.00402\n10.1261/rna.1541209\n10.1038/cr.2011.22\n10.2478/s11658-014-0212-6\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.04.082\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.04.245\n10.1016/j.bcp.2021.114716\n10.1172/JCI131178\n10.1152/ajpendo.00089.2020\n10.1186/s13098-022-00966-y\n10.2337/db10-1557\n10.2337/db11-0478\n10.1167/iovs.64.7.13\n10.1186/1476-4598-9-16\n10.15252/embr.201540750\n10.1038/srep02535\n10.1139/bcb-2019-0434\n10.1002/dmrr.322\n10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1427\n10.1073/pnas.0803055105\n10.1038/srep43798\n10.1038/s41598-018-24907-w\n10.1093/cvr/cvx253\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.734550\n10.1172/JCI82719\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.07.008\n10.1002/jcp.22322\n10.3390/ijms22168629\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2018.05.046\n10.1038/srep20304\n10.1186/s13098-022-00791-3\n10.1111/jcmm.16890\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.065\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.10.136\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.09.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0123987\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00355\n10.1101/gr.133728.111\n10.1371/journal.pone.0053880\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.056"}

Infarcted and peri-infarcted heart tissue, and whole cerebra, were isolated from mice at sacrifice, 7 days following LCA ligation.

{"title": "Activation of cannabinoid receptors 2 alleviates myocardial damage in cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis by inhibiting pyroptosis.", "abstract": "It has been reported that cannabinoid receptors 2 (CB2 receptors) play an important role in the pathophysiological process of sepsis, which may also be associated with the regulation of pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of CB2 receptors on myocardial damage in a model of septic mice by inhibiting pyroptosis.\nThe C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. All mice were randomly divided into the sham, CLP, or CLP+HU308 group. Blood and heart tissue samples were collected 12\u00a0h after surgery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used for analyzing histopathological results. Creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB) and IL-1\u03b2 were measured using ELISA, while lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was determined using photoelectric colorimetry. The expression levels of CB2 receptors and pyroptosis-associated proteins (NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD) were measured using western blotting. The location and distribution of CB2 receptors and caspase-1 in myocardial tissues were assessed by immunofluorescence. TUNEL staining was used to quantify the number of dead cells in myocardial tissues.\nThe CLP procedure increased CB2 receptor expression in mice. CB2 receptors were located in myocardial macrophages. Activating CB2 receptors decreased the levels of myocardial damage mediator LDH, CK-MB, and inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2. The results also showed that CLP increased the pyroptosis in myocardial tissues, while CB2 agonist HU308 inhibited pyroptosis by decreasing the level of NLRP3 and activating caspase-1 and GSDMD.\nCB2 receptor activation has a protective effect on the myocardium of mice with sepsis by inhibiting pyroptosis.", "journal": "Immunology letters", "date": "2023-11-03", "authors": ["JingjingZhang", "YaliZhu", "ShuxianChen", "ZujinXu", "BinZhang", "AnpengLiu", "QianwenHe", "JiaZhan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.imlet.2023.10.007"}

Among heart diseases, most deaths are due to myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack, which occurs when a decrement in blood flow to the heart causes injury to cardiac tissue.

Exosomes are a kind of small extracellular vesicles released by different types of cells that play a part in intercellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules important in regenerative medicine.

{"title": "Cx43 can form functional channels at the nuclear envelope and modulate gene expression in cardiac cells.", "abstract": "Classically associated with gap junction-mediated intercellular communication, connexin43 (Cx43) is increasingly recognized to possess non-canonical biological functions, including gene expression regulation. However, the mechanisms governing the localization and role played by Cx43 in the nucleus, namely in transcription modulation, remain unknown. Using comprehensive and complementary approaches encompassing biochemical assays, super-resolution and immunogold transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that Cx43 localizes to the nuclear envelope of different cell types and in cardiac tissue. We show that translocation of Cx43 to the nucleus relies on Importin-\u03b2, and that Cx43 significantly impacts the cellular transcriptome, likely by interacting with transcriptional regulators.

{"title": "The Emergence of Nanotechnology in the Prognosis and Treatment of Myocardial Infarctions.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, is a critical cardiovascular condition associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Despite significant advancements in traditional treatment modalities, there remains a need for innovative approaches to improve the prognosis and treatment outcomes of MI. The emergence of nanotechnology has provided a promising avenue for revolutionizing the management of this life-threatening condition. This manuscript aims to explore the role of nanotechnology in the prognosis and treatment of myocardial infarctions. Nanotechnology offers unique advantages in the field of cardiovascular medicine, including targeted drug delivery, precise imaging and diagnosis, regenerative medicine approaches, biosensors and monitoring, and the integration of therapy and diagnostics (theragnostic). One of the key advantages of nanotechnology is the ability to deliver therapeutic agents directly to the affected site. Nanoparticles can be engineered to carry drugs specifically to damaged heart tissue, enhancing their efficacy while minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, nanoparticles can serve as contrast agents, facilitating high-resolution imaging and accurate diagnosis of infarcted heart tissue. Furthermore, nanotechnology-based regenerative approaches show promise in promoting tissue healing and regeneration after MI. Nanomaterials can provide scaffolding structures or release growth factors to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels and support tissue repair. This regenerative potential holds significant implications for restoring cardiac function and minimizing long-term complications. Nanotechnology also enables real-time monitoring of critical parameters within the heart, such as oxygen levels, pH, and electrical activity, through the utilization of nanoscale devices and sensors. This capability allows for the early detection of complications and facilitates timely interventions. Moreover, the integration of therapy and diagnostics through nanotechnology-based platforms, known as theragnostic, holds tremendous potential. Nanoparticles can simultaneously deliver therapeutic agents while providing imaging capabilities, enabling personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patients. This manuscript will review the recent advancements, clinical trials, and patents in nanotechnology for the prognosis and treatment of myocardial infarctions.

The lack of effective treatment combined with the considerable socioeconomic burden highlights the urgent need for innovative therapeutic options.

These EVs were more effective in reducing pro-fibrotic markers in activated human cardiac fibroblasts, when compared to EV-N or EV-H3. We show that EV-H5 act through the canonical TGF\u03b2/SMAD pathway, primarily via miR-302b-3p, which is the most abundant miRNA in EV-H5. Our results show that EV-H5 not only target transcripts of several profibrotic genes, including SMAD2 and TGFBR2, but also reduce the stiffness of activated fibroblasts. In a mouse model of heart fibrosis, EV-H5 outperformed EV-N in suppressing the inflammatory response in the host and by attenuating collagen deposition and reducing pro-fibrotic markers in cardiac tissue.\nIn this work, we provide evidence of superior anti-fibrotic properties of EV-H5 over EV-N or EV-H3.

However, the contribution of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) to Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has not been completely understood.\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the FRGs and TTS.\nTTS rat models were established by isoprenaline injection. Heart tissues were subsequently harvested for total RNA extraction and library construction. Transcriptome data wereobtained transcriptome data for TTS and FRGs from our laboratory, and sources such as the Ferroptosis Database (FerrDb) and the Gene Expression Omnibus Database (GEO). 57 differentially expressed FRGs (DE-FRGs) were discovered. The LASSO and SVM-RFE algorithms were employed to identify Enpp2, Pla2g6, Etv4, and Il1b as marker genes, and logistic regression was applied to construct a diagnostic model. The important genes were validated by real time PCR and the external dataset. Finally, the extent of immune infiltration was explored.\nAmong the 57 genes, there were 36 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated genes that exhibited distinct expression patterns in the TTS and healthy control samples. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the enriched pathways were primarily associated with pathways of neurodegeneration-multiple disease, while Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were primarily linked to cellular response to external stimuli, outer membrane functions, and ubiquitin protein ligase binding.

{"title": "Effect of Sulforaphane on cardiac injury induced by sepsis in a mouse model: Role of toll-like receptor 4.", "abstract": "As sepsis is associated with a 50% increase in mortality, sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy has become a critical topic. A multidisciplinary approach is required for the diagnosis and treatment of septic cardiomyopathy. This study looked at Sulforaphane, a natural product that aims to evaluate cardiac function after sepsis, and its likely mechanism of action. Twenty-four adult male Swiss albino mice were randomly divided into 4 equal groups (n=6): sham, CLP, vehicle Sulforaphane (the same amount of DMSO injected IP one hour before the CLP), and Sulforaphane group (one hour before the CLP, a 5mg/kg dose of Sulforaphane was injected). Cardiac tissue levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), pro-inflammatory mediators, anti-inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers, apoptosis markers, and serum cardiac damage biomarkers were assessed using ELISA. Statistical analyses, including t-tests and ANOVA tests, were performed with a significance level of 0.05 for normally distributed data. Compared to the sham group, the sepsis group had significantly elevated levels of TLR-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MIF, F2-isoprostane, caspase-3, cTn-I, and CK-MB (p<0.05). In contrast, the Sulforaphane pre-treated group demonstrated significantly lower levels of these markers (p<0.05). Additionally, Bcl-2 levels were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in the Sulforaphane group. Sulforaphane administration also significantly attenuated cardiac tissue injury (p<0.05). The findings suggest that Sulforaphane can decrease heart damage in male mice during CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis by suppressing TLR-4/NF-kB downstream signal transduction pathways.", "journal": "Journal of medicine and life", "date": "2023-10-30", "authors": ["Sarah Mohammed HussainHadi", "SaharMajeed", "Fadhaa AbdulameerGhafil", "KaswerAltoraihi", "Najah RayishHadi"], "doi": "10.25122/jml-2023-0015\n10.1186/s13054-021-03862-5\n10.1201/9781315140629-35\n10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2019.2019.8.40\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00210\n10.1016/j.intimp.2018.03.002.\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02379\n10.5772/intechopen.74550\n10.1590/1519-6984.228437\n10.1042/BCJ20210854\n10.2147/JIR.S307305\n10.36740/WLek202301117\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7526-6_14\n10.1038/s41598-020-57497-7\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7172-5_4.\n10.1161/01.res.83.1.85\n10.1177/0300985813485099\n10.2174/2213988501812010027\n10.2147/IJGM.S328419\n10.4266/acc.2020.00248.\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000063\n10.3892/etm.2019.7657\n10.5530/ijper.55.4.205\n10.3390/vaccines5040034\n10.4049/jimmunol.0803988\n10.1155/2018/2859135.\n10.3390/cells8020194.\n10.22203/eCM.v041a37\n10.1631/jzus.B2101075\n10.1111/sji.12653\n10.3390/antiox10020145\n10.1016/j.tifs.2017.02.002.\n10.1038/s41401-021-00727-z.\n10.1074/jbc.M111.312694.\n10.3892/ijmm.2020.4563"}

{"title": "Recent Perspectives on Cardiovascular Toxicity Associated with Colorectal Cancer Drug Therapy.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of cancer-related therapy that has a significant influence on patient outcomes and quality of life. The use of antineoplastic drugs to treat colorectal cancers (CRCs) is associated with a number of undesirable side effects including cardiac complications. For both sexes, CRC ranks second and accounts for four out of every ten cancer deaths. According to the reports, almost 39% of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent first-line chemotherapy suffered cardiovascular impairment. Although 5-fluorouracil is still the backbone of chemotherapy regimen for colorectal, gastric, and breast cancers, cardiotoxicity caused by 5-fluorouracil might affect anywhere from 1.5% to 18% of patients. The precise mechanisms underlying cardiotoxicity associated with CRC treatment are complex and may involve the modulation of various signaling pathways crucial for maintaining cardiac health including TKI ErbB2 or NRG-1, VEGF, PDGF, BRAF/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, and the PI3/ERK/AMPK/mTOR pathway, resulting in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and apoptosis, ultimately damaging cardiac tissue. Thus, the identification and management of cardiotoxicity associated with CRC drug therapy while minimizing the negative impact have become increasingly important. The purpose of this review is to catalog the potential cardiotoxicities caused by anticancer drugs and targeted therapy used to treat colorectal cancer as well as strategies focused on early diagnosing, prevention, and treatment of cardiotoxicity associated with anticancer drugs used in CRC therapy.", "journal": "Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-10-28", "authors": ["Monu KumarKashyap", "Shubhada VMangrulkar", "SapanaKushwaha", "AkashVed", "Mayur BKale", "Nitu LWankhede", "Brijesh GTaksande", "Aman BUpaganlawar", "Milind JUmekar", "SushrutaKoppula", "Spandana RajendraKopalli"], "doi": "10.3390/ph16101441\n10.1200/JCO.2016.70.5400\n10.5694/j.1326-5377.2011.tb03766.x\n10.1161/JAHA.120.018403\n10.3390/jcm10081647\n10.3322/caac.21341\n10.1042/CS20200305\n10.1016/j.jval.2015.03.1102\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.08.010\n10.1016/j.adcanc.2022.100083\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2021.102282\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.06.017\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114015\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.07.014\n10.1016/j.annonc.2022.10.003\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.04.007\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.10.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.206920\n10.3390/ijms23010441\n10.1016/j.esmoop.2022.100745\n10.1016/j.jcecho.2011.05.007\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110492\n10.2174/157340311799960645\n10.1038/srep44735\n10.1038/s41419-021-03614-x\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.01.096\n10.3390/ijms23052815\n10.1016/j.jare.2021.11.008\n10.1038/s41698-017-0034-x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000138190.50127.6A\n10.2147/OTT.S149716\n10.3390/cells9010198\n10.1007/s00280-015-2827-3\n10.1016/j.rpor.2020.02.005\n10.1097/MD.0000000000012705\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2023.01.001\n10.1016/j.bcp.2022.115209\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.721107\n10.3390/biom12020299\n10.1289/ehp.01109s127\n10.21037/jgo.2019.03.04\n10.1016/j.repc.2012.11.002\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.07.012\n10.2147/VHRM.S108874\n10.3390/jcdd9080259\n10.1182/blood-2018-10-881557\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.02.009\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114135\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa006\n10.1155/2017/4708076\n10.1016/j.coph.2022.102332\n10.1016/j.phoj.2022.06.004\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2022.10.010\n10.1111/j.1440-1746.2012.07200.x\n10.1016/j.medidd.2022.100147\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.09.001\n10.1016/j.esmoop.2022.100427\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2014.12.006\n10.1016/j.esmoop.2022.100642\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.060\n10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2022.02.001\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.07.005\n10.4103/jpcs.jpcs_33_17\n10.1053/j.gastro.2015.03.016\n10.1016/j.ajps.2022.09.002\n10.1016/j.metabol.2022.155250\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.11.006\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.01.101\n10.2147/OTT.S264156\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0312\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.05.077\n10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2022.101380\n10.1016/j.gendis.2022.05.006\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2007.11.005\n10.3892/ol.2017.5557\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.12.027\n10.1002/med.21463\n10.3748/wjg.v20.i15.4178\n10.1007/s10557-020-06941-x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.06.002\n10.3390/jcm9092885\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.863314\n10.3390/ijms21176348\n10.1016/j.radonc.2022.04.030\n10.1016/j.trecan.2015.07.004\n10.1016/j.jff.2022.105384\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-842\n10.1016/j.tips.2022.10.003\n10.1016/j.apsb.2022.11.007\n10.1097/CAD.0000000000000513\n10.1016/j.isci.2022.105283\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.07.035\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.728\n10.3389/fphar.2021.741451"}

{"title": "The Role of M1 and M2 Myocardial Macrophages in Promoting Proliferation and Healing via Activating Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.", "abstract": "(1) Background: The activation of sequential processes for the formation of permanent fibrotic tissue following myocardial infarction (MI) is pivotal for optimal healing of heart tissue. M1 and M2 macrophages are known to play essential roles in wound healing by the activation of cardiac fibroblasts after an episode of MI. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediated by these macrophages in cellular proliferation, fibrosis, and wound healing remain unclear. (2) Methods: In the present study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms by which M1 and M2 macrophages contribute to cellular proliferation, fibrosis, and wound healing. Using both in vivo and cellular models, we examined the remodeling effects of M1 and M2 macrophages on infarcted cardiac fibroblasts and their role in promoting cardiac healing post-MI. (3) Results: Our findings indicate that M1 macrophages induce a proliferative effect on infarcted cardiac fibroblasts by exerting an anti-apoptotic effect, thereby preventing cell death. Moreover, M1 macrophages were found to activate the mechanism of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), resulting in wound healing and inducing the fibrotic process. The present findings suggest that M1 macrophages play a crucial role in promoting cardiac remodeling post-MI, as they activate the EMT pathway and contribute to increased collagen production and fibrotic changes. (4) Conclusions: The present study provides insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms mediated by M1 and M2 macrophages in cellular proliferation, fibrosis, and wound healing post-MI. Our findings highlight the critical role of M1 macrophages in promoting cardiac remodeling by activating the EMT pathway. Understanding these mechanisms can potentially result in the development of targeted therapies aimed at enhancing the healing process and improving outcomes following MI.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2023-10-28", "authors": ["ShaoweiKang", "BinWang", "YananXie", "XuCao", "MeiWang"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines11102666\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.009\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.12.010\n10.3390/biomedicines9080904\n10.1186/s12872-023-03231-w\n10.1152/ajpheart.00597.2018\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00101\n10.1038/nri3073\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.10.001\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.008\n10.2741/2692\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.01.002\n10.2174/1381612826666200213123029\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.916346\n10.1038/nri1733\n10.1080/10428190290012182\n10.1021/acsomega.2c00571\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.01462\n10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100773\n10.18632/oncotarget.3862\n10.2174/1568006033337276\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.7.060804.100453\n10.1093/cvr/cvz336\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303895\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.041\n10.1186/s12967-019-1780-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314028\n10.7150/thno.37106"}

A common feature of the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophies is chronic inflammation associated with the replacement of muscle mass with fibrotic scarring. With the progression of these disorders, many patients suffer cardiomyopathies with fibrosis of the cardiac tissue. Anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids represent the standard of care for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common muscular dystrophy worldwide; however, long-term exposure to glucocorticoids results in highly adverse side effects, limiting their use. Thus, it is important to develop new pharmacotherapeutic approaches to limit inflammation and fibrosis to reduce muscle damage and promote repair.

{"title": "Quantification of human mature frataxin protein expression in nonhuman primate hearts after gene therapy.", "abstract": "Deficiency in human mature frataxin (hFXN-M) protein is responsible for the devastating neurodegenerative and cardiodegenerative disease of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). It results primarily through epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene by GAA triplet repeats on intron 1 of both alleles. GAA repeat lengths are most commonly between 600 and 1200 but can reach 1700. A subset of approximately 3% of FRDA patients have GAA repeats on one allele and a mutation on the other. FRDA patients die most commonly in their 30s from heart disease. Therefore, increasing expression of heart hFXN-M using gene therapy offers a way to prevent early mortality in FRDA. We used rhesus macaque monkeys to test the pharmacology of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)hu68.CB7.hFXN therapy. The advantage of using non-human primates for hFXN-M gene therapy studies is that hFXN-M and monkey FXN-M (mFXN-M) are 98.5% identical, which limits potential immunologic side-effects. However, this presented a formidable bioanalytical challenge in quantification of proteins with almost identical sequences. This could be overcome by the development of a species-specific quantitative mass spectrometry-based method, which has revealed for the first time, robust transgene-specific human protein expression in monkey heart tissue. The dose response is non-linear resulting in a ten-fold increase in monkey heart hFXN-M protein expression with only a three-fold increase in dose of the vector.", "journal": "Communications biology", "date": "2023-10-28", "authors": ["TeerapatRojsajjakul", "Juliette JHordeaux", "Gourav RChoudhury", "Christian JHinderer", "ClementinaMesaros", "James MWilson", "Ian ABlair"], "doi": "10.1038/s42003-023-05472-z\n10.1126/science.271.5254.1423\n10.1016/j.neuint.2017.08.002\n10.2217/nmt-2022-0011\n10.1089/ars.2009.3015\n10.1093/hmg/ddm102\n10.1093/hmg/ddn244\n10.1074/jbc.M113.525857\n10.1038/ncomms6686\n10.1038/s41467-017-01497-1\n10.1038/s41467-019-11470-9\n10.1038/mt.2015.41\n10.1056/NEJM199610173351601\n10.3389/fnins.2022.874768\n10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00091\n10.3390/ijms22041815\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.007\n10.1016/j.omtn.2023.05.014\n10.1016/j.drudis.2023.103610\n10.1038/nm.3510\n10.1089/hum.2019.363\n10.1016/j.omtm.2020.08.018\n10.1038/s41598-020-72884-w\n10.1021/pr0501721\n10.1002/rcm.2787\n10.4155/bio.15.195\n10.1373/clinchem.2010.152264\n10.3390/biom13091335\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01175\n10.1021/acs.chemrestox.2c00161\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.07.007\n10.1016/j.omtm.2017.12.007\n10.1002/jcph.2141\n10.1038/srep10775\n10.1186/1471-2164-9-246\n10.1371/journal.pone.0276294\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.03.014\n10.1126/sciadv.abm1890\n10.1016/j.omtm.2022.10.011\n10.1038/s41586-021-03770-2\n10.1186/s13023-023-02619-3\n10.1016/j.yrtph.2022.105332\n10.1016/j.neuron.2022.05.003\n10.1089/hum.1997.8.10-1195\n10.1016/j.omtm.2022.02.002\n10.1080/10409230600846058\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04590\n10.1089/hum.2010.055\n10.1089/hgtb.2013.131\n10.1002/mas.21540"}

{"title": "Neutral sphingomyelinase regulates mechanotransduction in human engineered cardiac tissues and mouse hearts.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the USA and is known to be exacerbated by elevated mechanical stress from hypertension. Caveolae are plasma membrane structures that buffer mechanical stress but have been found to be reduced in pathological conditions associated with chronically stretched myocardium. To explore the physiological implications of the loss of caveolae, we used human engineered cardiac tissue (ECT) constructs, composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and hiPSC-derived cardiac fibroblasts, to develop a long-term cyclic stretch protocol that recapitulates the effects of hypertension on caveolae expression, membrane tension, and the \u03b2-adrenergic response. Leveraging this new stretch protocol, we identified neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMase) as mechanoregulated mediators of caveolae loss, ceramide production and the blunted \u03b2-adrenergic response in this human cardiac model. Specifically, in our ECT model, nSMase inhibition via GW4869 prevented stretch-induced loss of caveolae-like structures, mitigated nSMase-dependent ceramide production, and maintained the ECT contractile kinetic response to isoprenaline. These findings are correlated with a blood lipidomic analysis in middle-aged and older adults, which revealed an increase of the circulating levels of ceramides in adults with hypertension. Furthermore, we found that conduction slowing from increased pressure loading in mouse left ventricle was abolished in the context of nSMase inhibition. Collectively, these findings identify nSMase as a potent drug target for mitigating stretch-induced effects on cardiac function. KEY POINTS: We have developed a new stretch protocol for human engineered cardiac tissue that recapitulates changes in plasma membrane morphology observed in animal models of pressure/volume overload. Stretch of engineered cardiac tissue induces activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), generation of ceramide, and disassembly of caveolae. Activation of nSMase blunts cardiac \u03b2-adrenergic contractile kinetics and mediates stretch-induced slowing of conduction and upstroke velocity. Circulating ceramides are increased in adults with hypertension, highlighting the clinical relevance of stretch-induced nSMase activity.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2023-10-27", "authors": ["Daniel G PTurner", "Willem JDe Lange", "YanlongZhu", "Christopher LCoe", "JudithSimcox", "YingGe", "Timothy JKamp", "J CarterRalphe", "Alexey VGlukhov"], "doi": "10.1113/JP284807"}

{"title": "Biomimetic Cardiac Tissue Models for In Vitro Arrhythmia Studies.", "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Many arrhythmias are caused by reentry, a phenomenon where excitation waves circulate in the heart. Optical mapping techniques have revealed the role of reentry in arrhythmia initiation and fibrillation transition, but the underlying biophysical mechanisms are still difficult to investigate in intact hearts. Tissue engineering models of cardiac tissue can mimic the structure and function of native cardiac tissue and enable interactive observation of reentry formation and wave propagation. This review will present various approaches to constructing cardiac tissue models for reentry studies, using the authors' work as examples. The review will highlight the evolution of tissue engineering designs based on different substrates, cell types, and structural parameters.

{"title": "DNA hypomethylation by fisetin preserves mitochondria functional genes and contributes to the protection of I/R rat heart.", "abstract": "Myocardial I/R can alter the expression of different sets of cardiac genes that negatively influence the I/R outcome via epigenetic modifications. Fisetin is known to be cardioprotective against I/R, but its underlying epigenetic mode of action is not known and is addressed in the present study. Male Wistar rats were subjected to I/R by using the Langendorff perfusion system. Fisetin (20\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.) was administered before I/R induction, followed by the measurement of cardiac injury, hemodynamics, physiological indices, the differential expression of genes that regulate DNA methylation, and the function of mitochondria were performed. Fisetin administered I/R rat heart significantly reduced the global DNA hypermethylation and infarct size with an improved physiological recovery, measured via RPP (81%) and LVDP (82%) from the I/R control. Additionally, we noted decreased expression of the DNMT1 gene by 35% and increased expression of the TET1, TET2, and TET3 genes in fisetin-treated I/R rat hearts. Molecular docking analysis data reveals that the fisetin inhibits DNMT1 at the substrate binding site with minimum binding energy (-\u20098.2\u00a0kcal/mol) compared to the DNMT1 inhibitor, 5-azacytidine. Moreover, fisetin-treated I/R heart reversed the expression of the I/R-linked declined expression of bioenergetics genes (MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, MT-Cyt B, MT-COX1, MT-COX2, MT-ATP6), mitochondrial fission gene (Fis1), replication control genes PGC-1\u03b1, POLG, and TFAM to near-normal level. Based on the above findings, we demonstrated that fisetin possesses the ability to modulate the expression of different mitochondrial genes via influencing the global DNA methylation in cardiac tissue, which contributes significantly to the improved contractile function and thereby renders cardioprotection against I/R.", "journal": "Functional & integrative genomics", "date": "2023-10-26", "authors": ["Sri RahaviBoovarahan", "KirankumarBalu", "PriyankaPrem", "BhavanaSivakumar", "Gino AKurian"], "doi": "10.1007/s10142-023-01257-z\n10.1007/s00109-014-1233-3\n10.3389/fcell.2021.696428\n10.1038/s41598-021-89314-0\n10.1002/jbt.22911\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2022.148566\n10.3389/fgene.2022.995887\n10.3390/biomedicines10123065\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.1021909\n10.1016/j.mito.2020.06.004\n10.1172/jci62874\n10.1196/annals.1341.022\n10.1371/journal.pone.0119687\n10.1590/1414-431x20209717\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009692\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489\n10.2337/dbi18-0016\n10.1007/978-3-319-55330-6_5\n10.3389/fcell.2020.625089\n10.1536/ihj.19-131\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1080/15548627.2018.1532263\n10.1016/j.tox.2017.07.019\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00002\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)75283-1\n10.3390/biom11020135\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.03.006\n10.1038/s41598-017-01743-y\n10.1155/2018/9173436\n10.1007/s12013-021-01026-4\n10.1002/jcc.21334"}

Drug-induced cardiotoxicity remains an important clinical issue. Both traditional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cell models and animal models have their own limitations and are not fully suitable for the study of human heart physiology or pathology. Cardiac organoids are three-dimensional (3D) and self-organized structures that accurately retain the biological characteristics and functions of heart tissue. In this study, we successfully established a human cardiac organoid model by inducing the directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells, which recapitulates the patterns of early myocardial development. Moreover, this model accurately characterized the cardiotoxic damage caused by the anticancer drug doxorubicin, including clinical cardiac injury and cardiac function indicators, cell apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, as well as mitochondrial damage. In general, the cardiac organoid model can be used to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of drugs, opening new directions and ideas for drug screening and cardiotoxicity research.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2023-10-26", "authors": ["XiChen", "NaLu", "ShengboHuang", "YuanjinZhang", "ZongjunLiu", "XinWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2023.110777"}
{"title": "A data-driven computational model for engineered cardiac microtissues.", "abstract": "Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) present a potential solution to some of the current challenges in the treatment of heart disease; however, the development of mature, adult-like cardiac tissues remains elusive. Mechanical stimuli have been observed to improve whole-tissue function and cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation, although our ability to fully utilize these mechanisms is hampered, in part, by our incomplete understanding of the mechanobiology of EHTs. In this work, we leverage experimental data, produced by a mechanically tunable experimental setup, to introduce a tissue-specific computational modeling pipeline of EHTs. Our new modeling pipeline generates simulated, image-based EHTs, capturing ECM and myofibrillar structure as well as functional parameters estimated directly from experimental data. This approach enables the unique estimation of EHT function by data-based estimation of CM active stresses. We use this experimental and modeling pipeline to study different mechanical environments, where we contrast the force output of the tissue with the computed active stress of CMs. We show that the significant differences in measured experimental forces can largely be explained by the levels of myofibril formation achieved by the CMs in the distinct mechanical environments, with active stress showing more muted variations across conditions. The presented model also enables us to dissect the relative contributions of myofibrils and extracellular matrix to tissue force output, a task difficult to address experimentally. These results highlight the importance of tissue-specific modeling to augment EHT experiments, providing deeper insights into the mechanobiology driving EHT function. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) have the potential to revolutionize the way heart disease is treated. However, developing mature cardiomyocytes (CM) in these tissues remains a challenge due, in part, to our incomplete understanding of the fundamental biomechanical mechanisms that drive EHT development. This work integrates the experimental data of an EHT platform developed to study the influence of mechanics in CM maturation with computational biomechanical models. This approach is used to augment conclusions obtained in-vitro - by measuring quantities such as cell stress and strain - and to dissect the relevance of each component in the whole tissue performance.

{"title": "Suppressors of cGAS-STING are downregulated during fin-limb regeneration and aging in aquatic vertebrates.", "abstract": "During the early stages of limb and fin regeneration in aquatic vertebrates (i.e., fishes and amphibians), blastema undergo transcriptional rewiring of innate immune signaling pathways to promote immune cell recruitment. In mammals, a fundamental component of innate immune signaling is the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, cGAS-STING. However, to what extent the cGAS-STING pathway influences regeneration in aquatic anamniotes is unknown. In jawed vertebrates, negative regulation of cGAS-STING activity is accomplished by suppressors of cytosolic DNA such as Trex1, Pml, and PML-like exon 9 (Plex9) exonucleases. Here, we examine the expression of these suppressors of cGAS-STING, as well as inflammatory genes and cGAS activity during caudal fin and limb regeneration using the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) and axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) model species, and during age-related senescence in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In the regenerative blastema of wounded gar and axolotl, we observe increased inflammatory gene expression, including interferon genes and interleukins 6 and 8. We also observed a decrease in axolotl Trex1 and gar pml expression during the early phases of wound healing which correlates with a dramatic increase in cGAS activity. In contrast, the plex9.1 gene does not change in expression during wound healing in gar. However, we observed decreased expression of plex9.1 in the senescing cardiac tissue of aged zebrafish, where 2'3'-cGAMP levels are elevated. Finally, we demonstrate a similar pattern of Trex1, pml, and plex9.1 gene regulation across species in response to exogenous 2'3'-cGAMP. Thus, during the early stages of limb-fin regeneration, Pml, Trex1, and Plex9.1 exonucleases are downregulated, presumably to allow an evolutionarily ancient cGAS-STING activity to promote inflammation and the recruitment of immune cells.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

This paper presents an investigation focused on predicting the elastic performance of the human heart after a left ventricular apical infarction. The aim is to understand the elastic alterations of the cardiac fibres at different periods after an apical infarct. For this purpose, a hybrid method based on pressure and volume measurements of the left ventricle (LV) at different periods of ventricular remodelling, and the Finite Element Method (FEM), is developed. In addition, several performance indexes are defined to evaluate the heart performance during the ventricular remodelling process. The results show that during the first 2\u2009weeks after a heart infarction, the cardiac fibres must support a much higher structural overload than during normal conditions. This structural overload is proportional to the aneurysm size but diminishes with the time, together with a significant reduction of the ventricular pumping capacity.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

{"title": "Modulating cardiac physiology in engineered heart tissue with the bidirectional optogenetic tool BiPOLES.", "abstract": "Optogenetic actuators are rapidly advancing tools used to control physiology in excitable cells, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. In neuroscience, these tools have been used to either excite or inhibit neuronal activity. Cell type-targeted actuators have allowed to study the function of distinct cell populations. Whereas the first described cation channelrhodopsins allowed to excite specific neuronal cell populations, anion channelrhodopsins were used to inhibit neuronal activity. To allow for simultaneous excitation and inhibition, opsin combinations with low spectral overlap were introduced. BiPOLES (Bidirectional Pair of Opsins for Light-induced Excitation and Silencing) is a bidirectional optogenetic tool consisting of the anion channel Guillardia theta anion-conducting channelrhodopsin 2 (GtACR2 with a blue excitation spectrum and the red-shifted cation channel Chrimson. Here, we studied the effects of BiPOLES activation in cardiomyocytes. For this, we knocked in BiPOLES into the adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) locus of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), subjected these to cardiac differentiation, and generated BiPOLES expressing engineered heart tissue (EHT) for physiological characterization. Continuous light application activating either GtACR2 or Chrimson resulted in cardiomyocyte depolarization and thus stopped EHT contractility. In contrast, short light pulses, with red as well as with blue light, triggered action potentials (AP) up to a rate of 240 bpm. In summary, we demonstrate that cation, as well as anion channelrhodopsins, can be used to activate stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with pulsed photostimulation but also to silence cardiac contractility with prolonged photostimulation.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2023-10-21", "authors": ["BarboraSchwarzov\u00e1", "TimSt\u00fcdemann", "MuhammedS\u00f6nmez", "JudithR\u00f6ssinger", "BangfenPan", "ThomasEschenhagen", "JustusStenzig", "J SimonWiegert", "TorstenChrist", "FlorianWeinberger"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-023-02869-x\n10.1126/science.1195929\n10.1038/s41467-023-37622-6\n10.1126/science.1252367\n10.1038/nprot.2017.033\n10.1093/cvr/cvx250\n10.1172/JCI88950\n10.1038/nmeth.1512\n10.1002/adfm.202110590\n10.1038/srep35628\n10.1152/ajpcell.00551.2006\n10.1177/2041731419841748\n10.1038/s41569-020-00478-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041958\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00498\n10.1038/srep33530\n10.1126/science.aaa7484\n10.1126/science.aad3456\n10.1038/s41467-019-13637-w\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1038/s41586-023-05748-8\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.964247\n10.1038/nmeth.2836\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01806\n10.1161/01.RES.78.4.707\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035455\n10.1093/cvr/cvz245\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.006035\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000951\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy249\n10.1126/science.1072068\n10.1073/pnas.1936192100\n10.1038/nbt.3268\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw574\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.039711\n10.1093/toxsci/kfz076\n10.1002/stem.1653\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047904\n10.1109/LSSC.2023.3239601\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1111/febs.16925\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.060124\n10.3389/fphar.2016.00300\n10.1038/s41467-021-24759-5\n10.1093/cvr/cvv004\n10.1074/jbc.M115.699637\n10.1126/science.1249375\n10.1093/stmcls/sxac029\n10.1038/srep16542\n10.1073/pnas.1509380112\n10.1038/nn.2120"}

{"title": "Wnt10b protects cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin-induced cell death via MAPK modulation.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin, an anthracycline chemotherapeutic known to incur heart damage, decreases heart function in up to 11% of patients. Recent investigations have implicated the Wnt signaling cascade as a key modulator of cardiac tissue repair after myocardial infarction. Wnt upregulation in murine models resulted in stimulation of angiogenesis and suppression of fibrosis after ischemic insult. However, the molecular mechanisms of Wnt in mitigating doxorubicin-induced cardiac insult require further investigation. Identifying cardioprotective mechanisms of Wnt is imperative to reducing debilitating cardiovascular adverse events in oncologic patients undergoing treatment.\nExposing human cardiomyocyte AC16 cells to varying concentrations of Wnt10b and DOX, we observed key metrics of cell viability. To assess the viability and apoptotic rates, we utilized MTT and TUNEL assays. We quantified cell and mitochondrial membrane stability via LDH release and JC-1 staining. To investigate how Wnt10b mitigates doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, we introduced pharmacologic inhibitors of key enzymes involved in apoptosis: FR180204 and SB203580, ERK1/2 and p38 inhibitors. Further, we quantified apoptotic executor enzymes, caspase 3/7, via immunofluorescence.\nAC16 cells exposed solely to doxorubicin were shrunken with distorted morphology. Cardioprotective effects of Wnt10b were demonstrated via a reduction in apoptosis, from 70.1% to 50.1%. LDH release was also reduced between doxorubicin and combination groups from 2.27-fold to 1.56-fold relative to the healthy AC16 control group. Mitochondrial membrane stability was increased from 0.67-fold in the doxorubicin group to 5.73 in co-treated groups relative to control. Apoptotic protein expression was stifled by Wnt10b, with caspase3/7 expression reduced from 2.4- to 1.3-fold, and both a 20% decrease in p38 and 40% increase in ERK1/2 activity.\nOur data with the AC16 cell model demonstrates that Wnt10b provides defense mechanisms against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and apoptosis. Further, we explain a mechanism of this beneficial effect involving the mitochondria through simultaneous suppression of pro-apoptotic p38 and anti-apoptotic ERK1/2 activities.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2023-10-19", "authors": ["LeiChen", "Stefano HByer", "RachelHolder", "LingyuanWu", "KyleyBurkey", "ZubairShah"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0277747\n10.1371/journal.pone.0252816\n10.1007/s10557-016-6711-0\n10.1016/j.phrs.2017.03.016\n10.1159/000265166\n10.7326/0003-4819-91-5-710\n10.1172/JCI72931\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306886\n10.1007/s00441-014-2010-x\n10.1124/pr.117.013896\n10.1002/cncr.11407\n10.1200/JCO.2004.06.033\n10.1371/journal.pone.0119214\n10.1007/s00277-003-0615-3\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000130926.51766.CC\n10.1093/annonc/mdi152\n10.1126/scisignal.2002242\n10.1126/scisignal.2002274\n10.1152/ajpheart.00063.2012\n10.1038/nm0502-459\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000665\n10.3390/ijms21072346\n10.1126/science.6093249\n10.1038/nrm831\n10.1091/mbc.e04-08-0732\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1649\n10.1038/bjc.1997.227\n10.1038/nm.2919\n10.1007/s00204-014-1448-7\n10.5483/bmbrep.2008.41.1.011"}
{"title": "Macrophage RAGE deficiency prevents myocardial fibrosis by repressing autophagy-mediated macrophage alternative activation.", "abstract": "Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is the characteristic pathological feature of various cardiovascular diseases that lead to heart failure (HF) or even fatal outcomes. Alternatively, activated macrophages are involved in the development of fibrosis and tissue remodeling. Although the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is involved in MF, its potential role in regulating macrophage function in cardiac fibrosis has not been fully investigated. We aimed to determine the role of macrophage RAGE in transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced MF. In this study, we found that RAGE expression was markedly increased in the infiltrated alternatively activated macrophages within mice hearts after TAC. RAGE knockout mice showed less infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis compared to the wild-type mice. Our data suggest that mice with macrophage-specific genetic deletion of RAGE were protected from interstitial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction when subjected to pressure overload, which led to a decreased proportion of alternatively activated macrophages in heart tissues. Our in\u00a0vitro experiments demonstrated that RAGE deficiency inhibited the differentiation into alternatively activated macrophages by suppressing autophagy activation. In the co-culture system, in\u00a0vitro polarization of RAW264.7 macrophages toward an alternatively activated phenotype stimulated the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and collagen in cardiac fibroblasts. However, the knockdown of RAGE and inhibition of autophagy in macrophages showed reduced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Collectively, our results suggest that RAGE plays an important role in the recruitment and activation of alternatively activated macrophages by regulating autophagy, which contributes to MF. Thus, blockage of RAGE signaling may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertensive heart disease.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2023-10-19", "authors": ["JiaqiHe", "LanWei", "ShenganTan", "BirongLiang", "JingLiu", "LuLu", "TingWang", "JunyanWang", "YushengHuang", "ZixinChen", "HuanLi", "LuZhang", "ZhengZhou", "YanhongCao", "XiaohanYe", "ZhongqiYang", "ShaoxiangXian", "LingjunWang"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.202300173RR"}
{"title": "Adipose stem cells in tissue regeneration and repair: From bench to bedside.", "abstract": "ADSCs are a large number of mesenchymal stem cells in Adipose tissue, which can be applied to tissue engineering. ADSCs have the potential of multi-directional differentiation, and can differentiate into bone tissue, cardiac tissue, urothelial cells, skin tissue, etc. Compared with other mesenchymal stem cells, ADSCs have a multitude of promising advantages, such as abundant number, accessibility in cell culture, stable function, and less immune rejection. There are two main methods to use ADSCs for tissue repair and regeneration. One is to implant the \"ADSCs-scaffold composite\" into the injured site to promote tissue regeneration. The other is cell-free therapy: using ADSC-exos or ADSC-CM alone to release a large number of miRNAs, cytokines and other bioactive substances to promote tissue regeneration. The tissue regeneration potential of ADSCs is regulated by a variety of cytokines, signaling molecules, and external environment. The differentiation of ADSCs into different tissues is also induced by growth factors, ions, hormones, scaffold materials, physical stimulation, and other factors. The specific mechanisms are complex, and most of the signaling pathways need to be further explored.

{"title": "Integrative Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Cytoskeleton Regulation and Mitophagy Difference Between Ischemic Cardiomyopathy and Dilated Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are the two primary etiologies of end-stage heart failure. However, there remains a dearth of comprehensive understanding the global perspective and the dynamics of the proteome and phosphoproteome in ICM and DCM, which hinders the profound comprehension of pivotal biological characteristics as well as differences in signal transduction activation mechanisms between these two major types of heart failure. We conducted high-throughput quantification proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis of clinical heart tissues with ICM or DCM, which provided us the system-wide molecular insights into pathogenesis of clinical heart failure in both ICM and DCM. Both protein and phosphorylation expression levels exhibit distinct separation between heart failure and normal control heart tissues, highlighting the prominent characteristics of ICM and DCM. By integrating with omics results, Western blots, phosphosite-specific mutation, chemical intervention, and immunofluorescence validation, we found a significant activation of the PRKACA-GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway in ICM. This signaling pathway influenced remolding of the microtubule network and regulated the critical actin filaments in cardiac construction. Additionally, DCM exhibited significantly elevated mitochondria energy supply injury compared to ICM, which induced the ROCK1-vimentin signaling pathway activation and promoted mitophagy. Our study not only delineated the major distinguishing features between ICM and DCM but also revealed the crucial discrepancy in the mechanisms between ICM and DCM. This study facilitates a more profound comprehension of pathophysiologic heterogeneity between ICM and DCM and provides a novel perspective to assist in the discovery of potential therapeutic targets for different types of heart failure.", "journal": "Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP", "date": "2023-10-19", "authors": ["MuyinLiu", "LinhuiZhai", "ZhaohuaYang", "SuLi", "TianxianLiu", "AoChen", "LuluWang", "YouranLi", "RuidongLi", "ChenguangLi", "MinjiaTan", "ZhangweiChen", "JuyingQian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mcpro.2023.100667"}

The expression levels of stimulator of interferon gene (STING) and interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation increased in M-I/R heart tissues and hypoxia-treated/reoxygenation-treated H9c2 cells. The ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) significantly suppressed the stimulation of STING-IRF3 transcription and alleviated cardiac dysfunction caused by M-I/R injury. In addition, 4-PBA reversed ischemia-induced/reperfusion-induced autophagic flux dysfunction, as demonstrated by a decrease in p 62 and LC3 levels. Similarly, the protective effect of STING deficiency on myocardial cell damage was achieved by the recovery of autophagic flux. Conversely, the protective effect of 4-PBA against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in cardiomyocytes was offset by STING overexpression, wherein the activated STING-IRF3 pathway promoted the expression of Rubicon (a negatively-regulated autophagic molecule) by binding to the Rubicon promoter. Rubicon ablation effectively counteracts the adverse effects of STING overexpression in cardiomyocytes. The data showed that STING-IRF3 signaling of ER stress receptors is particularly important in the progression of physiological M-I/R caused by the inhibition of autophagic flow in vivo and in vitro.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2023-10-18", "authors": ["YuanbinLi", "HuiLin", "HaoTang", "KeZhu", "ZhangfuZhou", "ZhaohuiZeng", "BinPan", "ZhuangChen"], "doi": "10.1097/FJC.0000000000001465"}

However, the association between 17(R)-RvD1 and pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear.\nTransverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery was performed to establish a cardiac hypertrophy model. C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the Sham, TAC and TAC+17(R)-RvD1 groups. 17(R)-RvD1 was injected (2 \u03bcg/kg, i.p.) before TAC surgery and once every other day after surgery for 4 weeks. The same volume of saline was injected into the mice in both Sham group and TAC group.

{"title": "MyoLoop: Design, development and validation of a standalone bioreactor for pathophysiological electromechanical in vitro cardiac studies.", "abstract": "Mechanical load is one of the main determinants of cardiac structure and function. Mechanical load is studied in vitro using cardiac preparations together with loading protocols (e.g., auxotonic, isometric). However, such studies are often limited by reductionist models and poorly simulated mechanical load profiles. This hinders the physiological relevance of findings. Living myocardial slices have been used to study load in vitro. Living myocardial slices (LMS) are 300-\u03bcm-thick intact organotypic preparations obtained from explanted animal or human hearts. They have preserved cellular populations and the functional, structural, metabolic and molecular profile of the tissue from which they are prepared. Using a three-element Windkessel (3EWK) model we previously showed that LMSs can be cultured while performing cardiac work loops with different preload and afterload. Under such conditions, LMSs remodel as a function of the mechanical load applied to them (physiological load, pressure or volume overload). These studies were conducted in commercially available length actuators that had to be extensively modified for culture experiments. In this paper, we demonstrate the design, development and validation of a novel device, MyoLoop. MyoLoop is a bioreactor that can pace, thermoregulate, acquire and process data, and chronically load LMSs and other cardiac tissues in vitro. In MyoLoop, load is parametrised using a 3EWK model, which can be used to recreate physiological and pathological work loops and the remodelling response to these.

The adult homozygous knockout mb(Auzf13.2) zebrafish line were absent of Mb protein, had an almost complete degradation of mb mRNA, and showed no changes in viability, length, or heart size. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of adult heart tissue showed that mb knockout did not cause altered expression of other genes. Lastly, no off-targeting was observed in 36 screened loci. In conclusion, we have generated three mb knockout lines with indistinguishable phenotypes during embryonic and larval development and validated one of these lines, mb(Auzf13.2), to have no signs of genetic compensation or off-target effects in the adult heart.

It has been known that helminths and worm-derived proteins are capable of modulating host immune response to suppress excessive inflammation as a survival strategy. Excretory/secretory products from Trichinella spiralis adult worms (Ts-AES) have been shown to ameliorate inflammation-related diseases. In this study, Ts-AES were used to treat mice with MI to determine its therapeutic effect on reducing MI-induced heart inflammation and the immunological mechanism involved in the treatment.\nThe MI model was established by the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by the treatment of Ts-AES by intraperitoneal injection. The therapeutic effect of Ts-AES on MI was evaluated by measuring the heart/body weight ratio, cardiac systolic and diastolic functions, histopathological change in affected heart tissue and observing the 28-day survival rate. The effect of Ts-AES on mouse macrophage polarization was determined by stimulating mouse bone marrow macrophages in vitro with Ts-AES, and the macrophage phenotype was determined by flow cytometry. The protective effect of Ts-AES-regulated macrophage polarization on hypoxic cardiomyocytes was determined by in vitro co-culturing Ts-AES-induced mouse bone marrow macrophages with hypoxic cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis determined by flow cytometry.\nWe observed that treatment with Ts-AES significantly improved cardiac function and ventricular remodeling, reduced pathological damage and mortality in mice with MI, associated with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, increased regulatory cytokine expression and promoted macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 type in MI mice. Ts-AES-induced M2 macrophage polarization also reduced apoptosis of hypoxic cardiomyocytes in vitro.\nOur results demonstrate that Ts-AES ameliorates MI in mice by promoting the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 type.

In addition to causing excessive daytime sleepiness and neurocognitive effects, OSA is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Using exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH) to mimic OSA, we have recently reported that mice exposed to IH exhibit endothelial cell (EC) activation, which is an early process preceding the development of cardiovascular disease. Although widely used, IH models have several limitations such as the severity of hypoxia, which does not occur in most patients with OSA. Recent studies reported that mice with deletion of hemeoxygenase 2 (Hmox2-/-), which plays a key role in oxygen sensing in the carotid body, exhibit spontaneous apneas during sleep and elevated levels of catecholamines. Here, using RNA-sequencing we investigated the transcriptomic changes in aortic ECs and heart tissue to understand the changes that occur in Hmox2-/- mice. In addition, we evaluated cardiac structure, function, and electrical properties by using echocardiogram and electrocardiogram in these mice. We found that Hmox2-/- mice exhibited aortic EC activation. Transcriptomic analysis in aortic ECs showed differentially expressed genes enriched in blood coagulation, cell adhesion, cellular respiration and cardiac muscle development and contraction. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis in heart tissue showed a differentially expressed gene set enriched in mitochondrial translation, oxidative phosphorylation and cardiac muscle development. Analysis of transcriptomic data from aortic ECs and heart tissue showed loss of Hmox2 gene might have common cellular network footprints on aortic endothelial cells and heart tissue. Echocardiographic evaluation showed that Hmox2-/- mice develop progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities compared to Hmox2+/+ mice.

In a prospective analysis of infants who underwent CMR with tissue mappings, EMB, and genetic testing, the sample was categorized into two groups: those with inflammatory cardiomyopathy and negative genetics (indicative of possible myocarditis) and those with positive genetics (indicative of possible dilated cardiomyopathy). All patients exhibited similar clinical presentations, echocardiographic dysfunction, and elevated troponins and NT-proBNP levels. Additionally, they all\u00a0met the diagnostic criteria for inflammatory cardiomyopathy based on EMB findings (\u226514 mononuclear cells, \u22657 T-lymphocytes/mm2). EMB results unveiled significant differences\u00a0in the presence of inflammation and edema between the two groups, with higher troponin levels correlating with increased inflammation. Notably, when focusing on CMR, neither the classic criteria nor the 2018 Lake Louise criteria (LLC) could effectively differentiate between the two\u00a0groups. Only late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) appeared to be associated with myocarditis in this cohort, while other LLC and tissue mappings did not exhibit a similar correlation. Importantly, there was no observed correlation between the inflammation detected through EMB and CMR.\nThe onset of heart dysfunction in infants can result from either inherited factors or viral infections, both of which may involve inflammation. However, the precise role of EMB and CMR in determining the etiology of such cases remains poorly\u00a0defined. While CMR demonstrates high sensitivity in detecting inflammation, our experience suggests that it may not effectively differentiate between these two groups. A comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential when addressing this challenge, which includes considering EMB (with attention to the number of T-lymphocytes and the presence of oedema), specific CMR criteria, notably LGE and tissue mappings, as well as the identification of viral agents in cardiac tissue and\u00a0troponin levels.

Considering the lack of reliable in vitro tissue-like models to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of cardiac regeneration, we used cryoinjury on rat Engineered Heart Tissues (rEHTs) as a new model which recapitulates in part the in vivo response after myocardial injury of neonatal and adult heart. When we subjected to cryoinjury immature and mature rEHTs, we observed a significant increase in cardiomyocyte (CM) DNA synthesis when compared to the controls. As expected, the number of mitotic CMs significantly increases in immature rEHTs when compared to mature rEHTs, suggesting that the extent of CM maturation plays a crucial role in their proliferative response after cryoinjury. Moreover, we show that cryoinjury induces a temporary activation of fibroblast response in mature EHTs, similar to the early response after MI, that is however incomplete in immature EHTs. Our results support the hypothesis that the endogenous maturation program in cardiac myocytes plays a major role in determining the proliferative response to injury.

This situation is speculated to be caused by the current therapies, such as reperfusion therapy after ischemic injury, drugs, rehabilitation, and other traditional treatments, that do not directly target the infarcted myocardium. Consequently, these therapies cannot fundamentally solve the problems of myocardial pathological remodeling and the reduction of cardiac function after myocardial infarction, allowing for the progression of heart failure after myocardial infarction. Coupled with the decline in mortality caused by acute myocardial infarction in recent years, this combination leads to an increase in the incidence of heart failure. As a new promising therapy rising at the beginning of the twenty-first century, cardiac regenerative medicine provides a new choice and hope for the recovery of cardiac function and the prevention and treatment of heart failure after myocardial infarction. In the past two decades, regeneration engineering researchers have explored and summarized the elements, such as cells, scaffolds, and cytokines, required for myocardial regeneration from all aspects and various levels day and night, paving the way for our later scholars to carry out relevant research and also putting forward the current problems and directions for us. Here, we describe the advantages and challenges of cardiac tissue engineering, a contemporary innovative therapy after myocardial infarction, to provide a reference for clinical treatment.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2023-10-16", "authors": ["BingbingSun", "LongWang", "WenminGuo", "ShixuanChen", "YujieMa", "DongweiWang"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2023.1251669\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.04.036\n10.1056/NEJM200106073442303\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031542\n10.1038/nature20173\n10.1038/s41418-020-0492-5\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00328.2017\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307017\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2225\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.1161/01.RES.0000118601.37875.AC\n10.1038/nm0405-367\n10.1038/nm912\n10.1007/s00109-012-0915-y\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310954\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310599\n10.3390/cells8070727\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.3390/cells9010213\n10.3390/cells8091095\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049497\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.08.006\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1186/s13287-020-01602-0\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.00645\n10.1038/cmi.2013.60\n10.1186/gm354\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00363-0\n10.1093/cvr/cvs427\n10.1016/j.scr.2008.02.003\n10.1172/JCI37456\n10.2174/0929867323666160525114735\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.07.066\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.06.005\n10.1038/nature13309\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv136\n10.1001/jama.2012.25321\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.11.009\n10.1002/ejhf.2178\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.09.001\n10.1016/j.ahj.2019.09.005\n10.3390/pharmaceutics12121195\n10.1016/j.phrs.2008.06.007\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.25.2981\n10.33594/000000180\n10.1172/JCI72181\n10.1073/pnas.1102561108\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.021\n10.1016/j.pep.2009.10.004\n10.1126/science.1238856\n10.1021/bp0499101\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.042\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.07.103\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.07.023\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.05.028\n10.1093/biosci/biv084\n10.3402/jev.v4.27066\n10.1152/ajprenal.00200.2009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311326\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2012.08.008\n10.1083/jcb.201211138\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.04.007\n10.1016/j.scr.2013.01.002\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.118538\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.01.015\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311769\n10.1161/JAHA.119.014345\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.266015\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.12.043\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.227\n10.7150/thno.20524\n10.1038/nature24045\n10.1126/scitranslmed.abd6892\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111425\n10.3389/fphys.2021.650566\n10.1002/med.21839\n10.1038/s41551-018-0229-7\n10.1002/term.1944\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1002/term.2392\n10.1586/14779072.4.2.239\n10.1016/j.jmst.2021.03.062\n10.1002/jbm.a.36894\n10.1007/978-981-13-0950-2_18\n10.7150/thno.22599\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120285\n10.1002/adma.201506420\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.011\n10.1002/adma.201702713\n10.1007/s12010-019-02967-6\n10.1039/C7CC01988B\n10.1039/C8BM01050A\n10.1177/0885328219886029\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.12.035\n10.1038/s41467-019-10004-7\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.04.014\n10.1002/adhm.201900593\n10.1002/adhm.201600307\n10.1002/adma.201706442\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.02.045\n10.1042/CS20060301\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0527\n10.1038/srep38815\n10.1007/978-1-4939-0512-6_18\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.07.048\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302335\n10.1002/adhm.201700695\n10.1007/s10741-020-09953-9\n10.1002/jbm.a.35442\n10.1124/jpet.118.256065\n10.1002/adhm.201600497\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c00344\n10.1039/b905130a\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.06.040\n10.1038/s41467-021-21682-7\n10.1002/adhm.201600808\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.002\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)64535-7\n10.1126/science.1091867\n10.1186/1479-5876-1-1"}

The Chinese medicine Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge (AAB), as a representative of heat-clearing and engendering fluid, is often used clinically in the treatment of DCM. Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge total saponins (RATS) are the main bioactive components of AAB, the modern pharmacologic effects of RATS are anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and cardioprotective. However, the potential protective mechanisms of RATS against DCM remain largely undiscovered.\nThe primary goal of this study was to explore the effect of RATS on DCM and its mechanism of action.\nStreptozotocin and a high-fat diet were used to induce DCM in rats. UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS was used to determine the chemical components of RATS. The degenerative alterations and apoptotic cells in the heart were assessed by HE staining and TUNEL. Network pharmacology was used to anticipate the probable targets and important pathways of RATS. The alterations in metabolites and main metabolic pathways in heart tissue were discovered using \nFirst of all, UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis showed that RATS contained 11 active ingredients. In animal experiments, we found that RATS lowered blood glucose and lipid levels in DCM rats, and alleviated cardiac pathological damage, and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the study found that RATS effectively reduced inflammatory factor release and the level of oxidative stress. Mechanistically, RATS downregulated the expression levels of PI3K, AKT, HIF-1\u03b1, LDHA, and GLUT4 proteins. Additionally, glycolysis was discovered to be a crucial pathway for RATS in the therapy of DCM.\nOur findings suggest that the protective effect of RATS on DCM may be attributed to the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/HIF-1\u03b1 pathway and the correction of glycolytic metabolism.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2023-10-14", "authors": ["LuyangZhong", "JianhuaLi", "JiaminYu", "XiaCao", "JieyongDu", "LanyuanLiang", "MengruYang", "YiminYue", "MantongZhao", "TongZhou", "JiaziLin", "XiaoWang", "XuejuanShen", "YanmeiZhong", "YiWang", "ZunpengShu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2023.117250"}
{"title": "Chronic diastolic stretch unmasks conduction defects in an in vitro model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "We seek to elucidate the precise nature of mechanical loading that precipitates conduction deficits in a concealed-phase model of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). ACM is a progressive disorder often resulting from mutations in desmosomal proteins. Exercise has been shown to worsen disease progression and unmask arrhythmia vulnerability, yet the underlying pathomechanisms may depend on the type and intensity of exercise. Because exercise causes myriad changes to multiple inter-dependent hemodynamic parameters, it is difficult to isolate its effects to specific changes in mechanical load. Here, we use engineered heart tissues (EHTs) with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing R451G desmoplakin, an ACM-linked mutation, which results in a functionally null model of desmoplakin (DSP). We also use a novel bioreactor to independently perturb tissue strain at different time points during the cardiac cycle.

These IL-5 transgenic mice exhibited decreased left ventricular function at a young age which worsened with age. Mechanistically, we demonstrated infiltration of activated eosinophils into the heart tissue that led to an inflammatory environment.

{"title": "The role of cardiac resident macrophage in cardiac aging.", "abstract": "Advancements in longevity research have provided insights into the impact of cardiac aging on the structural and functional aspects of the heart. Notable changes include the gradual remodeling of the myocardium, the occurrence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and the decline in both systolic and diastolic functions. Macrophages, a type of immune cell, play a pivotal role in innate immunity by serving as vigilant agents against pathogens, facilitating wound healing, and orchestrating the development of targeted acquired immune responses. Distinct subsets of macrophages are present within the cardiac tissue and demonstrate varied functions in response to myocardial injury. The differentiation of cardiac macrophages according to their developmental origin has proven to be a valuable strategy in identifying reparative macrophage populations, which originate from embryonic cells and reside within the tissue, as well as inflammatory macrophages, which are derived from monocytes and recruited to the heart.

Since cardiac autonomic modulation with electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors exerts cardioprotection against various heart diseases, the comparative effects of electrical VNS and an AChE inhibitor (donepezil) on cardiac and mitochondrial functions and programmed cell death pathways in TIC are not known. VNS devices were implanted in thirty-two male Wistar rats and were divided into 4 groups: (i) Control-Sham (CSham), (ii) Trz-Sham (TSham), (iii) Trz-VNS (TVNS), and (iv) Trz-donepezil (TDPZ). Rats in the Trz-treated groups were intraperitoneally injected with Trz (4\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 7\u00a0days, while CSham rats were injected with NSS. VNS devices were activated in the TVNS rats during the 7-day Trz treatment, but not in the sham rats. Rats in the TDPZ group received donepezil orally (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 7\u00a0days. At the end, left ventricular (LV) function and heart rate variability were evaluated, and heart tissue was collected for biochemical and histological analysis. Trz rats showed LV dysfunction and cardiac sympathovagal imbalance. In addition, mitochondrial function and dynamics were impaired in TIC rats. Trz also increased cardiomyocyte death by inducing apoptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. Electrical VNS and donepezil had similar efficacy in alleviating cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction, dynamic imbalances, and cardiomyocyte death, leading to improved LV function. These findings suggested that parasympathetic activation via either VNS or an AChE inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic intervention against TIC.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2023-10-11", "authors": ["ThawatchaiKhuanjing", "ChayodomManeechote", "BenjaminOngnok", "NanthipPrathumsap", "ApiwanArinno", "TitikornChunchai", "BusarinArunsak", "Siriporn CChattipakorn", "NiponChattipakorn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2023.115836"}

Loganin, a monoterpene iridoid glycoside derived from Cornus officinalis Sieb. Et Zucc, can exert cardioprotective effects in cardiac hypertrophy and atherosclerosis. However, its role in ischemic heart disease remains largely unknown.\nConsidering that Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/ signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has a protective effect on the heart, we developed a mouse model of MIRI to investigate the potential role of this pathway in loganin-induced cardioprotection.\nOur results showed that treatment with loganin (20\u00a0mg/kg) prevented the enlargement of myocardial infarction, myocyte destruction, serum markers of cardiac injury, and deterioration of cardiac function induced by MIRI. Myocardium subjected to I/R treatment exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress, as indicated by an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and dihydroethidium (DHE) density and a decrease in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), whereas treatment with loganin showed significant attenuation of I/R-induced oxidative stress. Loganin treatment also increased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and reduced the expression of caspase-3/9, Bax, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in ischemic cardiac tissue. Moreover, treatment with loganin triggered JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation, and AG490, a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, partially abrogated the cardioprotective effects of loganin, indicating the essential role of JAK2/STAT3 signaling in the cardioprotective effects of loganin.\nOur data demonstrate that loganin protects the heart from I/R injury by inhibiting I/R-induced oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis via activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2023-10-10", "authors": ["BoyuXia", "JiaqiDing", "QiLi", "KoulongZheng", "JingjingWu", "ChaoHuang", "KunLiu", "QingshengYou", "XiaomeiYuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.131426"}
{"title": "Allogeneic mitochondrial transplantation ameliorates cardiac dysfunction due to doxorubicin: An in vivo study.", "abstract": "Damage to the mitochondria may lead to serious conditions that are difficult to treat. Doxorubicin is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of malignancies in children and adults, and reportedly causes damage to the mitochondria. Unfortunately, the dangerous cardiac side effects of doxorubicin appear when the patient is in the midst of a vigorous fight against the disease, either by taking doxorubicin alone or in combination with other drugs. This study aimed to determine whether exogenous healthy and functional mitochondria are internalized by cells, can it help the survival of these cells, and can reduce cardiotoxicity. For this purpose, isolated, pure, and functional exogenous mitochondria were injected into the tail vein of a rat model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. After that, the heart function of the rats and their antioxidant status, inflammatory markers, and histopathological examination were investigated. Our findings show that intravenous mitochondrial transplantation provided efficient mitochondrial uptake and reduced cardiotoxicity by reducing ROS production, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation. In addition, the levels of ATP and antioxidant enzymes increased after mitochondrial transplantation; therefore all of these complex processes resulted in the reduction of apoptosis and necrosis in rat heart tissue. These promising results open the way to more effective cancer treatment without the side effects of related drugs. Transplanting exogenous mitochondria probably enhances the cell's mitochondrial network, potentially treating mitochondria-related disorders such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, although the exact relationship between mitochondrial damage and these conditions remains unclear.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2023-10-10", "authors": ["FarshidMaleki", "ShahramRabbani", "RezaShirkoohi", "MohsenRezaei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115651"}

Homing to other tissues has only been achieved via covalent surface modification strategies using small-molecule ligands, peptides, or monoclonal antibodies\u2500methods that are challenging to couple with large-scale manufacturing. Herein, we design a novel modular artificial membrane-binding protein (AMBP) platform for the modification of LNPs postformation. The system is composed of two protein modules that can be readily coupled using bioorthogonal chemistry to yield the AMBP. The first is a membrane anchor module comprising a supercharged green fluorescent protein (scGFP) electrostatically conjugated to a dynamic polymer surfactant corona. The second is a functional module containing a cardiac tissue fibronectin homing sequence from the bacterial adhesin CshA. We demonstrate that LNPs modified using the AMBP exhibit a 20-fold increase in uptake by fibronectin-rich C2C12 cells under static conditions and a 10-fold increase under physiologically relevant shear stresses, with no loss of cell viability.

{"title": "Hydrogels for Cardiac Restorative Support: Relevance of Gelation Mechanisms for Prospective Clinical Use.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue regenerative strategies have gained much traction over the years, in particular those utilizing hydrogels. With our review, and with special focus on supporting post-myocardial infarcted tissue, we aim to provide insights in determining crucial design considerations of a hydrogel and the implications these could have for future clinical use.\nTo date, two hydrogel delivery strategies are being explored, cardiac injection or patch, to treat myocardial infarction. Recent advances have demonstrated that the mechanism by which a hydrogel is gelated (i.e., physically or chemically cross-linked) not only impacts the biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and chemical structure, but also the route of delivery of the hydrogel and thus its effect on cardiac repair. With regard to cardiac regeneration, various hydrogels have been developed with the ability to function as a delivery system for therapeutic strategies (e.g., drug and stem cells treatments), as well as a scaffold to guide cardiac tissue regeneration following myocardial infarction. However, these developments remain within the experimental and pre-clinical realm and have yet to transition towards the clinical setting.", "journal": "Current heart failure reports", "date": "2023-10-09", "authors": ["Valentine CVetter", "Carlijn V CBouten", "Atzevan der Pol"], "doi": "10.1007/s11897-023-00630-0\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfr160\n10.3389/fcell.2021.747842\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00455\n10.1161/JAHA.120.020402\n10.1007/s10495-015-1203-4\n10.3389/fcell.2022.713934\n10.1016/j.coche.2016.11.003\n10.1038/natrevmats.2016.71\n10.3390/polym14040799\n10.1039/b713009k\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.07.044\n10.3390/app11177768\n10.1002/adhm.201801217\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00418\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.727420\n10.1016/j.healun.2017.12.011\n10.1038/s41392-021-00830-x\n10.1038/nbt1055\n10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.009\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.01.027\n10.1039/C1CS15203C\n10.1080/14712598.2017.1256389\n10.3390/gels7030077\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.06.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.12.035\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.04.001\n10.1016/S0167-7799(00)01485-2\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119289\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.07.002\n10.3390/ma6041285\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.010\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.10.024\n10.1016/j.cis.2017.07.012\n10.1039/C7CS00564D\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.012\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.07.035\n10.1021/acs.biomac.6b01378\n10.1021/bm8000414\n10.7150/thno.25504\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00175-8\n10.1111/php.13550\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.045\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.03.064\n10.1002/smll.201600178\n10.1039/C7BM00110J\n10.1002/adhm.201800672\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.067\n10.1007/s00726-004-0094-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.06.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120855\n10.1093/cvr/cvv214\n10.1021/bm1010195\n10.1038/s41570-019-0095-1\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz5380\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.08.036\n10.1016/j.jchf.2013.02.006\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.06.111\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.045\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.888\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.012\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.114.001478\n10.1038/s41467-021-21682-7\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.04.150\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9683\n10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.023\n10.1002/ADMA.201704235\n10.1126/sciadv.abe8739\n10.1089/ten.tec.2016.0492"}
{"title": "Advances in the design, generation, and application of tissue-engineered myocardial equivalents.", "abstract": "Due to the limited regenerative ability of cardiomyocytes, the disabling irreversible condition of myocardial failure can only be treated with conservative and temporary therapeutic approaches, not able to repair the damage directly, or with organ transplantation. Among the regenerative strategies, intramyocardial cell injection or intravascular cell infusion should attenuate damage to the myocardium and reduce the risk of heart failure. However, these cell delivery-based therapies suffer from significant drawbacks and have a low success rate. Indeed, cardiac tissue engineering efforts are directed to repair, replace, and regenerate native myocardial tissue function. In a regenerative strategy, biomaterials and biomimetic stimuli play a key role in promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and neo-tissue formation. Thus, appropriate biochemical and biophysical cues should be combined with scaffolds emulating extracellular matrix in order to support cell growth and prompt favorable cardiac microenvironment and tissue regeneration. In this review, we provide an overview of recent developments that occurred in the biomimetic design and fabrication of cardiac scaffolds and patches.

{"title": "WTAP boosts lipid oxidation and induces diabetic cardiac fibrosis by enhancing AR methylation.", "abstract": "Dysregulated lipid metabolism occurs in pathological processes characterized by cell proliferation and migration. Nonetheless, the mechanism of increased mitochondrial lipid oxidation is poorly appreciated in diabetic cardiac fibrosis, which is accompanied by enhanced fibroblast proliferation and migration. Herein, increased WTAP expression promotes cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration, contributing to diabetic cardiac fibrosis. Knockdown of WTAP suppresses mitochondrial lipid oxidation, fibroblast proliferation and migration to ameliorate diabetic cardiac fibrosis. Mechanistically, WTAP-mediated m6A methylation of AR induced its degradation, dependent on YTHDF2. Additionally, AR directly interacts with mitochondrial lipid oxidation enzyme Decr1; overexpression of AR-suppressed Decr1-mediates mitochondrial lipid oxidation, inhibiting cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration. Knockdown of AR produced the opposite effect. Clinically, increased WTAP and YTHDF2 levels correlate with decreased AR expression in human DCM heart tissue. We describe a mechanism wherein WTAP boosts higher mitochondrial lipid oxidation, cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and migration by enhancing AR methylation in a YTHDF2-dependent manner.", "journal": "iScience", "date": "2023-10-09", "authors": ["KaiSong", "HeSun", "BinTu", "YangZhou", "Li-ChanLin", "Zhi-YanLiu", "RuiLi", "Jing-JingYang", "YeZhang", "Jian-YuanZhao", "HuiTao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isci.2023.107931"}
{"title": "The endothelial glycocalyx-All the same? No, it is not.", "abstract": "The endothelial glycocalyx covers the lumen of blood vessels throughout the body and plays an important role in endothelial homeostasis. Advances in electron microscopy techniques have provided clues to better understand the structure and composition of identical vascular endothelial glycocalyx. The morphology and thickness of the endothelial glycocalyx differ from organ to organ. The content of the endothelial glycocalyx covering the vascular lumen differs even in the brain, heart, and lungs, which have the same continuous capillaries. Various types of inflammation are known to attenuate the endothelial glycocalyx; however, we found that the morphology of the glycocalyx damaged by acute inflammation differed from that damaged by chronic inflammation. Acute inflammation breaks the endothelial glycocalyx unevenly, whereas chronic inflammation leads to the overall shortening of the endothelial glycocalyx. The same drug has different effects on the endothelial glycocalyx, depending on the location of the target blood vessels. This difference in response may reflect not only the size and shape of the endothelial glycocalyx but also the different constituents. In the cardiac tissue, the expression of glypican-1, a core protein of the endothelial glycocalyx, was enhanced. By contrast, in the pulmonary tissue, the expression of heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 and endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 significantly increased in the treatment group compared with that in the no-treatment group. In this review, we present the latest findings on the evolution of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx and consider the microstructural differences.", "journal": "Acute medicine & surgery", "date": "2023-10-09", "authors": ["KodaiSuzuki", "TomotakaMiura", "HideshiOkada"], "doi": "10.1002/ams2.896"}

Punicalagin (PU), the major ellagitannin found in pomegranates, is characterized by multiple antioxidant activities. The aim of this study is to assess the protective effects of PU against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced acute myocardial damage and to investigate its underlying vascular mechanisms using rat model. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into five groups and were treated orally (p.o.) with PU (25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg) for 14 days. ISO was administered subcutaneously (S.C.) (85\u00a0mg/kg) on the 15th and 16th days to induce Myocardial infarction. Cardiac markers, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory cytokines levels were determined in the heart tissue. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to determine the protein expression pathways of inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in all the groups. In silico study was carried out to evaluate the molecular interaction of PU with some molecular targets. RESULTS: Our results showed that ISO-induced cardiac tissue injury was evidenced by increased serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), associated with several histopathological changes. ISO also induced an increase of MDA, PCO, NO, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), along with a decrease of antioxidant enzyme activities in the myocardial tissues. In addition, an increase of TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, Nrf2 and (HO-1) was observed. Pre-treatment with PU reduced myocardial infract area, ameliorated histopathological alterations in myocardium, and decreased activities of myocardial injury marker enzymes in ISO-induced rats. In addition, PU remarkably restored ISO-induced elevation of lipid peroxidation and decrease of antioxidants, significantly reduced myocardial pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations in this animal model. Molecular docking analysis of PU with protein targets showed potent interactions with negative binding energies. In conclusion, PU can protect the myocardium from oxidative injury, inflammatory response, and cell death induced by ISO by upregulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and antioxidants.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2023-10-09", "authors": ["Muthana MJghef", "KhadijaBoukholda", "YassineChtourou", "Bernd LFiebich", "MohammedKebieche", "RachidSoulimani", "FatihaChigr", "HamadiFetoui"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2023.110745"}

Lysine \u03b2-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) is a novel post-translational modification (PTM), wherein \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate is covalently attached to lysine \u03b5-amino groups. Recent studies have revealed that histone Kbhb contributes to tumor progression, diabetic cardiomyopathy progression, and postnatal heart development. However, no studies have yet reported a global analysis of Kbhb proteins in aging hearts or elucidated the mechanisms underlying this modification in the process. Herein, we conducted quantitative proteomics and Kbhb PTM omics to comprehensively elucidate the alterations of global proteome and Kbhb modification in the hearts of aged mice. The results revealed a decline in grip strength and cardiac diastolic function in 22-month-old aged mice compared to 3-month-old young mice. High-throughput liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry analysis identified 1710 \u03b2-hydroxybutyrylated lysine sites in 641 proteins in the cardiac tissue of young and aged mice. Additionally, 183 Kbhb sites identified in 134 proteins exhibited significant differential modification in aged hearts (fold change (FC) > 1.5 or <1/1.5, p < 0.05). Notably, the Kbhb-modified proteins were primarily detected in energy metabolism pathways, such as fatty acid elongation, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, these Kbhb-modified proteins were predominantly localized in the mitochondria. The present study, for the first time, provides a global proteomic profile and Kbhb modification landscape of cardiomyocytes in aged hearts.

{"title": "In need of age-appropriate cardiac models: Impact of cell age on extracellular matrix therapy outcomes.", "abstract": "Aging is the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As the world's population ages rapidly and CVD rates rise, there is a growing need for physiologically relevant models of aging hearts to better understand cardiac aging. Translational research relies heavily on young animal models; however, these models correspond to early ages in human life, therefore cannot fully capture the pathophysiology of age-related CVD. Here, we first investigated the transcriptomic and proteomic changes that occur with human cardiac aging. We then chronologically aged human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) and showed that 14-month-old iCMs exhibited a similar aging profile to the human CMs and recapitulated age-related disease hallmarks. Using aged iCMs, we studied the effect of cell age on the young extracellular matrix (ECM) therapy, an emerging approach for myocardial infarction (MI) treatment and prevention. Young ECM decreased oxidative stress, improved survival, and post-MI beating in aged iCMs. In the absence of stress, young ECM improved beating and reversed aging-associated expressions in 3-month-old iCMs while causing the opposite effect on 14-month-old iCMs. The same young ECM treatment surprisingly increased SASP and impaired beating in advanced aged iCMs. Overall, we showed that young ECM therapy had a positive effect on post-MI recovery; however, cell age was determinant in the treatment outcomes without any stress conditions. Therefore, \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches to ECM treatments fail, and cardiac tissue engineered models with age-matched human iCMs are valuable in translational basic research for determining the appropriate treatment, particularly for the elderly.", "journal": "Aging cell", "date": "2023-10-07", "authors": ["S GulberkOzcebe", "PinarZorlutuna"], "doi": "10.1111/acel.13966\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.05.064\n10.3390/gels7020070\n10.1590/S0100-879X2006000300010\n10.1002/adhm.201801217\n10.1007/s00059-017-4668-9\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.08.020\n10.1126/sciadv.1600844\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.673044\n10.3390/cells9102275\n10.3389/fcell.2022.822816\n10.1007/s12576-016-0509-5\n10.1253/circj.CJ-12-0987\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3001444\n10.1002/btm2.10110\n10.1161/JAHA.117.007230\n10.1038/s44161-022-00028-6\n10.7150/thno.70884\n10.1177/0963689718779346\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.1186/s13287-019-1486-4\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4780-08.2009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120554\n10.1038/emm.2017.94\n10.1016/j.arr.2004.09.003\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00586\n10.1126/science.abo1984\n10.1038/s41598-018-22628-8\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.274.2.H627\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.612215\n10.1080/08820139.2018.1504300\n10.1042/CS20110115\n10.1038/s41598-019-48948-x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.888\n10.1186/1477-7819-12-230\n10.1016/j.exger.2008.05.008\n10.1016/j.schres.2016.09.034\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045401\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1186/s13287-022-03021-9\n10.1016/j.actbio.2022.08.050\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.062\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.037\n10.1371/journal.pone.0073294"}

Male C57BL/6N mice aged eight weeks were randomly assigned to a control group, a model group, an empagliflozin(10 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)\u00b7d~(-1)) group, and high-and low-dose Jiming Powder(14.3 and 7.15 g\u00b7kg~(-1)\u00b7d~(-1)) groups. Mice in the control group were fed on a low-fat diet, and mice in the model group and groups with drug intervention were fed on a high-fat diet. All mice had free access to water, with water in the model group and Jiming Powder groups being supplemented with L-NAME(0.5 g\u00b7L~(-1)). Drugs were administered on the first day of modeling, and 15 weeks later, blood pressure and cardiac function of the mice in each group were measured. Heart tissues were collected for hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining to observe pathological changes and Masson's staining to observe myocardial collagen deposition. Untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on the plasma collected from mice in each group, and metabolic pathway analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst 5.0. The results showed that the blood pressure was significantly lower and the myocardial concentric hypertrophy and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction were significantly improved in both the high-dose and low-dose Jiming Powder groups as compared with those in the model group. HE and Masson staining showed that both high-dose and low-dose Jiming Powder significantly alleviated myocardial fibrosis.

The echocardiography and myocardial enzymes results showed that ferroptosis can aggravate TBI-induced cardiac dysfunction. The result of DHE staining and 4-HNE expression showed that inhibition of ferroptosis can reduce ROS production and lipid peroxidation in myocardial tissue. In further experiments, DFO intervention was used to explore the effect of iron overload inhibition on myocardial ferroptosis after TBI, the production of ROS, expression of p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB was detected to explore the effect of iron overload on myocardial inflammation after TBI.

Metformin, an activator of AMPK, is widely used as a first-line therapy for diabetes, but its role in preventing atherosclerosis and cardiac outcomes is unclear. Hence, we aimed to assess the effect of metformin on preventing atherosclerosis and its regulatory role in the Sestrin2-AMPK -mTOR pathway in obese/diabetic rats.\nAnimals were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity, administered streptozotocin to induce diabetes, and then treated with metformin (150 mg/kg body weight) for 14 weeks. Aorta and heart tissues were analyzed for Sestrin2 status by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, AMPK and mTOR activities were investigated using western blotting, and atherogenicity-related events were evaluated using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and histology.\nObese and diabetic rats showed significant decrease in Sestrin2 levels and AMPK activity, accompanied by increased mTOR activity in the heart and aorta tissues. Metformin treatment significantly restored Sestrin2 and AMPK levels, reduced mTOR activity, and restored the altered expression of inflammatory markers and adhesion molecules in obese and diabetic rats to normal levels. A histological analysis of samples from obese and diabetic rats showed atherosclerotic lesions both in aorta and heart tissues. The metformin-treated rats showed a decrease in atherosclerotic lesions, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyocyte degeneration.\nThis study presents further insights into the beneficial effects of metformin and its protective role against atherosclerosis through regulation of the Sestrin2-AMPK-mTOR pathway.", "journal": "Journal of lipid and atherosclerosis", "date": "2023-10-06", "authors": ["SaravanakumarSundararajan", "IsaivaniJayachandran", "Gautam KumarPandey", "SaravanakumarVenkatesan", "AnushaRajagopal", "KuppanGokulakrishnan", "MuthuswamyBalasubramanyam", "ViswanathanMohan", "NagarajManickam"], "doi": "10.12997/jla.2023.12.3.290"}

{"title": "Saponins of Panax japonicus ameliorates cardiac aging phenotype in aging rats by enhancing basal autophagy through AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway.", "abstract": "Heart disease is a significant health concern for elderly individuals, with heart aging being the primary cause. Recent studies have shown that autophagy can play a protective role in preventing cardiac aging. Our previous research confirmed that Chikusetsu saponin IVa, a fundamental component of Saponins of Panax japonics (SPJ), can enhance basic autophagy levels in cardiomyocyte of isoproterenol induced cardiac fibrosis mice. However, it remains unclear whether SPJ possesses a protective effect on cardiac dysfunction during the natural aging process. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: adult control group (6\u00a0months old), aging group (24\u00a0months old), aging group treated with 10\u00a0mg/kg SPJ, and aging group treated with 30\u00a0mg/kg SPJ. The heart function, blood pressure, and heart mass index (HMI) were measured. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) and Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) staining were used to observe the changes in morphology, while Masson staining was used to examine collagen deposition in the rat hearts and CD45 immunohistochemistry was conducted to examine the macrophage infiltration in heart tissues. TUNEL kit was used to detect apoptosis level of cardiomyocyte, and western blot was used to evaluate autophagy-related proteins as well as AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway-related markers. SPJ treatment improved the cardiac function, reduced HMI, attenuated myocardial fiber disorder, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreased collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in aging rats. Additionally, SPJ treatment decreased the expression of aging-related proteins and restored the expression of autophagy-related markers. SPJ activated autophagy through the activation of AMPK, which in turn increased the phosphorylation of ULK1(Ser555), while inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and ULK1(Ser757). Our study demonstrates that SPJ improves the cardiac function of aging rats by enhancing basal autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway.

{"title": "Quantifying the microstructural and biomechanical changes in the porcine ventricles during growth and remodelling.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue growth and remodelling (G & R) occur in response to the changing physiological demands of the heart after birth. The early shift to pulmonary circulation produces an immediate increase in ventricular workload, causing microstructural and biomechanical changes that serve to maintain overall physiological homoeostasis. Such cardiac G & R continues throughout life. Quantifying the tissue's mechanical and microstructural changes because of G & R is of increasing interest, dovetailing with the emerging fields of personalised and precision solutions. This study aimed to determine equibiaxial, and non-equibiaxial extension, stress-relaxation, and the underlying microstructure of the passive porcine ventricles tissue at four time points spanning from neonatal to adulthood. The three-dimensional microstructure was investigated via two-photon excited fluorescence and second-harmonic generation microscopy on optically cleared tissues, describing the 3D orientation, rotation and dispersion of the cardiomyocytes and collagen fibrils. The results revealed that during biomechanical testing, myocardial ventricular tissue possessed non-linear, anisotropic, and viscoelastic behaviour. An increase in stiffness and viscoelasticity was noted for the left and right ventricular free walls from neonatal to adulthood. Microstructural analyses revealed concomitant increases in cardiomyocyte rotation and dispersion. This study provides baseline data, describing the biomechanical and microstructural changes in the left and right ventricular myocardial tissue during G & R, which should prove valuable to researchers in developing age-specific, constitutive models for more accurate computational simulations. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There is a dearth of experimental data describing the growth and remodelling of left and right ventricular tissue. The published literature is fragmented, with data reported via different experimental techniques using tissues harvested from a variety of animals, with different gender and ages. This prevents developing a continuum of data spanning birth to death, so limiting the potential that can be leveraged to aid computational modelling and simulations. In this study, equibiaxial, non-equibiaxial, and stress-relaxation data are presented, describing directional-dependent material responses. The biomechanical data is consolidated with equivalent microstructural data, an important element for the development of future material models.

{"title": "The role and medical prospects of long non-coding RNAs in cardiovascular disease.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has reached epidemic proportions and is a leading cause of death worldwide. One of the long-standing goals of scientists is to repair heart tissue damaged by various forms of CVD such as cardiac hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, heart fibrosis, and genetic and developmental heart defects such as heart valve deformities. Damaged or defective heart tissue has limited regenerative capacity and results in a loss of functioning myocardium. Advances in transcriptomic profiling technology have revealed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is transcribed from what was once considered \"junk DNA.\" It has since been discovered that lncRNAs play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various CVDs and in myocardial regeneration. This review will explore how lncRNAs impact various forms of CVD as well as those involved in cardiomyocyte regeneration. Further, we discuss the potential of lncRNAs as a therapeutic modality for treating CVD.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2023-10-05", "authors": ["NajungKim", "Woo-YoungChung", "Je-YoelCho"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-023-10342-1\n10.1126/science.1058040\n10.1038/nature03001\n10.1038/nature09792\n10.1038/onc.2014.456\n10.1016/j.tig.2019.09.006\n10.1038/s41576-018-0017-y\n10.1038/s41580-020-00315-9\n10.3389/fonc.2020.598817\n10.1186/s12920-021-00918-x\n10.1186/s12872-022-02854-9\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001052\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5451\n10.7150/thno.57037\n10.1002/jbt.22709\n10.1111/cpr.12818\n10.1159/000485588\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.05.011\n10.5603/KP.2016.0141\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000208840.30778.00\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310624\n10.1002/jcp.27117\n10.1016/j.jacc.2021.11.021\n10.1038/nature13596\n10.4062/biomolther.2015.066\n10.3390/cells9102155\n10.1038/nm.4179\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2022.101065\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.318437\n10.18632/oncotarget.15544\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1007/s11886-020-01361-7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310051\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.10.021\n10.1161/JAHA.118.009700\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.12.005\n10.1038/s41418-020-0492-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.013\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.01.003\n10.1080/15476286.2021.1976549\n10.1146/annurev-biophys-083012-130404\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.04.004\n10.1093/nar/gkw236\n10.1080/14728222.2021.1938541\n10.14791/btrt.2014.2.1.1\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.03.004\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.03.004\n10.1126/science.272.5259.263\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.10.001\n10.3390/cells11060984\n10.1021/acsnano.1c04996\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)48095-7\n10.3389/fonc.2020.617837\n10.1016/j.addr.2012.08.008\n10.1016/j.mcna.2007.03.007\n10.1177/0192623390004Part_105\n10.1111/j.1472-8206.1990.tb01019.x\n10.1016/0891-5849(88)90004-4\n10.1517/14656566.2012.685163\n10.1002/ccd.28561\n10.1177/2048872619830609\n10.1007/s10238-021-00682-3\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa651\n10.1002/clc.22882\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.308165\n10.1186/s12967-020-02425-6\n10.1002/jcb.27769\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.003\n10.3892/ol.2016.5354\n10.1186/s12967-015-0383-6\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.03.023\n10.1016/j.tips.2019.10.009\n10.1038/s41573-021-00219-z\n10.3390/ijms222111596\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035832\n10.1159/000478870\n10.1536/ihj.21-434\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.04.085\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1659610\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.030\n10.1093/cvr/cvy075\n10.1002/iub.2187\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.04.009\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa519\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302476\n10.1016/j.omtn.2017.12.018\n10.1007/s11010-017-3008-y\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.11.031\n10.1002/jcp.28964\n10.1002/jcp.28131\n10.1002/jcp.28047\n10.1038/s41467-020-15995-2\n10.1038/nature20128"}

ICI-related myocarditis (irMyocarditis) is uncommon but has the highest mortality of any irAE. The pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to anti-tumor immunity remain poorly understood. We sought to define immune responses in heart, tumor, and blood during irMyocarditis and identify biomarkers of clinical severity by leveraging single-cell (sc)RNA-seq coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, microscopy, and proteomics analysis of 28 irMyocarditis patients and 23 controls. Our analysis of 284,360 cells from heart and blood specimens identified cytotoxic T cells, inflammatory macrophages, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and fibroblasts enriched in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Additionally, potentially targetable, pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs were upregulated across multiple cell types. TCR clones enriched in heart and paired tumor tissue were largely non-overlapping, suggesting distinct T cell responses within these tissues. We also identify the presence of cardiac-expanded TCRs in a circulating, cycling CD8 T cell population as a novel peripheral biomarker of fatality.

{"title": "Fibrosis quantification using multiphoton excitation imaging of picrosirius red stained cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Traditional methodologies for fibrosis quantification involve histological measurements, staining with Masson's trichrome and picrosirius red (PSR), and label-free imaging using second harmonic generation (SHG). The difficulty of label-free cardiac SHG imaging is that both collagen (i.e., collagen 1 fibrils) and myosin are harmonophores that generate SHG signals, and specific identification of either collagen or myosin is difficult to achieve. Here we present an alternate method of quantifying cardiac fibrosis by using PSR staining followed by multiphoton excitation fluorescence imaging. Our data from the deoxycorticosterone model of cardiac fibrosis shows that this imaging method and downstream analyses, including background correction, are robust and easy to perform. These advantages are due to the high signal-to-noise ratio provided by PSR in areas of collagen fibers. Furthermore, the hyperspectral and fluorescence lifetime information of PSR-stained area of fibrosis shows better quantification can eventually be obtained using more complex instrumentation.", "journal": "Research square", "date": "2023-10-04", "authors": ["Bryce AJones", "BelenTorrado", "KomuraiahMyakala", "Xiaoxin XWang", "Priscilla EPerry", "Avi ZRosenberg", "MosheLevi", "SumanRanjit"], "doi": "10.21203/rs.3.rs-3329402/v1\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa324\n10.1016/j.carpath.2011.01.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.1994.267.6.H2237\n10.1038/s41598-017-09470-0\n10.1186/1741-7015-4-38\n10.4081/ejh.2014.2448\n10.1021/acsnano.7b03150\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019097\n10.1111/1523-1747.ep12523538\n10.1016/B978-0-12-420138-5.00001-X\n10.1016/B978-0-12-420138-5.00019-7\n10.1016/B978-0-12-420138-5.00007-0\n10.1369/0022155414531549\n10.1084/jem.5.1.15\n10.1177/41.3.7679127\n10.1038/nprot.2012.009\n10.1364/AO.10.002350\n10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75414-3\n10.1242/jcs.152272\n10.1039/C9AN00267G\n10.1146/annurev-biophys-062920-063631\n10.1038/s41596-018-0026-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048014\n10.1364/BOE.8.003143\n10.1088/2050-6120/3/4/047001\n10.1016/j.kint.2016.06.030\n10.1038/srep13378\n10.1364/BOE.410347\n10.1093/europace/euaa389\n10.1080/09500340600769067\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000411\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1038/s41598-017-17204-5\n10.1364/OE.20.012729\n10.1038/s41598-017-08564-z"}

In our study, we exposed fabricated electrospun samples to repeated multistep tension by applying and removing deformation to mimic the mechanical behavior of helical fibered cardiac scaffolds. Since the fiber-based specimens exhibit viscoelastic behavior, the transient responses to constant deformation caused stress relaxation and stress recovery. However, these transient viscoelastic operations performed at high strain enable unpredictable phenomena, usually hidden behind stress softening and folding (plasticity) phenomena; the material significantly reduces the required stress, and remaining deformation occurs. Thus, by regulating the fabrication (electrospinning parameters) process and preconditioning before setting, the actual viscoelastic behavior of the electrospun scaffolds will be evident, as well as their limitations towards their application to cardiac patches development.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2023-10-04", "authors": ["AhmedAlAttar", "ElliGkouti", "AleksanderCzekanski"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106157"}
{"title": "Participation of ASK-1 in the cardiomyocyte-protective role of mechanical ventilation in a rat model of myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been demonstrated to exhibit a cardioprotective function in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). However, the mechanism underlying NIPPV-mediated MI progression requires further investigation. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and corresponding mechanism of NIPPV in an acute MI-induced heart failure (HF) rat model. Thirty each of healthy wild type (WT) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1)-deficient rats were enrolled in this study. MI models were established via anterior descending branch ligation of the left coronary artery. The corresponding data indicated that NIPPV treatment reduced the heart infarct area, myocardial fibrosis degree, and cardiac function loss in MI rats, and ameliorated apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the heart tissue. Furthermore, the expression level of ASK-1 level, a key modulator of the ROS-induced extrinsic apoptosis pathway, was upregulated in the heart tissues of MI rats, but decreased after NIPPV treatment. Meanwhile, the downstream cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP, alongside p38 phosphorylation and FasL expression, exhibited a similar trend to that of ASK-1 expression. The involvement of ASK-1 in NIPPV-treated MI in ASK-1-deficient rats was examined. Although MI modeling indicated that cardiac function loss was alleviated in ASK-1-deficient rats, NIPPV treatment did not confer any clear efficiency in cardiac improvement in ASK-1-knockdown rats with MI modeling. Nonetheless, NIPPV inhibited ROS-induced extrinsic apoptosis in the heart tissues of rats with MI by regulating ASK-1 expression, and subsequently ameliorated cardiac function loss and MI-dependent pathogenic changes in the heart tissue.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2023-10-03", "authors": ["JiyingLai", "AilinLi", "LinlinYue", "HuifengZhong", "ShuoXu", "XinLiu"], "doi": "10.1177/15353702231191205"}
{"title": "Few-shot transfer learning for personalized atrial fibrillation detection using patient-based siamese network with single-lead ECG records.", "abstract": "The proliferation of wearable devices has allowed the collection of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings daily to monitor heart rhythm and rate. For example, 24-hour Holter monitors, cardiac patches, and smartwatches are widely used for ECG gathering and application. An automatic atrial fibrillation (AF) detector is required for timely ECG interpretation. Deep learning models can accurately identify AFs if large amounts of annotated data are available for model training. However, it is impractical to request sufficient labels for ECG recordings for an individual patient to train a personalized model. We propose a Siamese-network-based approach for transfer learning to address this issue. A pre-trained Siamese convolutional neural network is created by comparing two labeled ECG segments from the same patient. We sampled 30-second ECG segments with a 50% overlapping window from the ECG recordings of patients in the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. Subsequently, we independently detected the occurrence of AF in each patient in the Long-Term AF Database. By fine-tuning the model with the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 ECG segments ranging from 30 to 180 s, our method achieved macro-F1 scores of 96.84%, 96.91%, 96.97%, 97.02%, 97.05%, and 97.07%, respectively.", "journal": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "date": "2023-10-03", "authors": ["YiuwaiNg", "Min-TsunLiao", "Ting-LiChen", "Chih-KuoLee", "Cheng-YingChou", "WeichungWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102644"}

By contrast, engineered heart tissues (EHTs) formed around two flexible pillars, can measure contraction force but conventional EHTs often require between 0.5 and 2 million cells.

Herein, this study explored the impact of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AdMSC)-exosomes (Exos) on CYP-induced cardiotoxicity.AdMSCs and AdMSCs-Exos were isolated and identified. CYP was utilized for developing a cardiotoxicity rat model, after which blood was collected and then the serum contents of cardiac injury-related indexes (creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Oxidative stress (OS)-related indicators were measured with the corresponding kits. Myocardial pathological changes and collagen fibrosis were tested with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining, and apoptosis-related and autophagy-related proteins in rat cardiac tissues with immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays, respectively.AdMSCs and AdMSCs-Exos were successfully isolated. AdMSCs-Exos could target rat hearts. AdMSCs-Exos improved cardiac function and diminished the content of the cardiac injury-related indexes in CYP rats.

{"title": "Blockage of DCLK1 in cardiomyocytes suppresses myocardial inflammation and alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a pathophysiological condition triggered by diabetes mellitus and can lead to heart failure. Doublecortin-like kinase protein 1 (DCLK1) is a multifunctional protein kinase involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. Current studies on DCLK1 mainly focus on cancer development; however, its role in non-tumor diseases such as DCM is yet to be deciphered. Our analysis revealed that DCLK1 was upregulated in cardiomyocytes of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mouse, suggesting a correlation between DCLK1 and DCM progression. It was further demonstrated that either cardiomyocyte-specific DCLK1 knockout or pharmacological DCLK1 inhibitor DCLK1-IN-1 significantly alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in STZ-induced diabetic mice. RNA-seq analysis of heart tissues revealed that DCLK1 regulated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-mediated inflammatory response in DCM. In vitro, DCLK1 activated NF-\u03baB and the inflammatory response by inducing the IKK\u03b2 phosphorylation in high-concentration glucose (HG)-challenged cardiomyocytes. DCLK1-IN-1 also prevented HG-induced IKK\u03b2/NF-\u03baB activation and inflammatory injuries in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, this study highlights the novel role of cardiomyocyte DCLK1 in regulating IKK\u03b2/NF-\u03baB, which aggravates inflammation to promote the pathogenesis of DCM.

Human heart tissue samples obtained during a biopsy procedure are routinely used to test for the presence of viruses, as guided by clinical manifestations and prognosis. Furthermore, heart tissue samples obtained post-mortem or during a cardiac transplant procedure serve as a valuable research tool, as they allow for an in-depth assessment of cardiac pathology that can aid in our understanding of molecular pathways associated with disease. Because viral nucleic acid constitutes only a small portion of each sample's genetic material, appropriate methods are necessary for positive viral genome identification.\nSnap-frozen heart tissue samples obtained either post-mortem or during a cardiac transplant procedure were used to develop conditions for detection of Parvovirus B19. Briefly, total DNA was isolated from the\u00a0heart tissue under varying conditions. A PCR-based assay with Parvovirus B19 specific primers was implemented to detect the presence of the viral genome, followed by Sanger Sequencing.

Previous studies have noted alterations in the expression and/or activity of Nuclear Factor E2 Related Factor 2 (NRF2) and its antioxidant targets during human gestational diabetic (GDM) pregnancy, however to our knowledge the functional role of NRF2 in fetal 'priming' of cardiovascular dysfunction in obese and GDM pregnancy has not been investigated. Using a murine model of obesity-induced glucose dysregulated pregnancy, we demonstrate that NRF2 activation by maternal sulforaphane (SFN) supplementation normalizes NRF2-linked NQO1, GCL and CuZnSOD expression in maternal and fetal liver placental and fetal heart tissue by gestational day 17.5. Activation of NRF2 in utero in wild type but not NRF2 deficient mice improved markers of placental efficiency and partially restored fetal growth. SFN supplementation was associated with reduced markers of fetal cardiac oxidative stress, including Nox2 and 3-nitrotyrosine, as well as attenuation of cardiac mass and cardiomyocyte area in male offspring by postnatal day 52 and improved vascular function in male and female offspring by postnatal day 98.

In this study, we compared the DNA methylation patterns of fresh, frozen, and FFPE cardiac tissue to investigate if the storage method affected the DNA methylation results. We used the Infinium MethylationEPIC assay to obtain genome-wide methylation levels in fresh, frozen, and FFPE tissues from nine individuals.

{"title": "Toxoplasma gondii in small mammals in Romania: the influence of host, season and sampling location.", "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects a large spectrum of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Small rodents and insectivores play an important role in the epidemiology of T. gondii and may serve as a source of infection for both, domestic and wild definitive felid hosts. Factors influencing the occurrence of T. gondii in wild small mammals are unknown, despite the fact that many intermediate host species are identified. We have used small mammals (Rodentia and Lipotyphla) captured over two years in various habitats, both in urbanised and in natural landscapes. We assessed the importance of land-use, season and host ecology on T. gondii infection.\nWe examined 471 individuals belonging to 20 small mammal species, collected at 63 locations spread over wide altitude, habitat and land-use ranges from Romania. Heart tissue samples were individually analysed by PCR targeting the 529\u00a0bp repetitive DNA fragment of T. gondii. The overall prevalence of infection was 7.3%, with nine species of rodents and two species of shrews being found to carry T. gondii DNA. Five species showed high frequency of infection, with the highest prevalence found in Myodes glareolus (35.5%), followed by Spermophilus citellus (33.3%), Sorex minutus (23.1%), S. araneus (21.7%) and Micromys minutus (11.1%). Adults seemed more often infected than young, however when controlling for season, the difference was not significant, as in spring both adults and young showed higher infection rates, but more adults were sampled. Contrary to our expectations, urban/rural areas (with their implicit high density of domestic feline presence) had no effect on infection prevalence. In addition, neither habitat, nor land-use at sampling sites was important as only geographical location and host species were contributing factors to the infection risk.\nHigh prevalence of T. gondii infection showed a highly localised, patchy occurrence, with long living and higher mobility host species being the most common carriers, especially during autumn.", "journal": "BMC veterinary research", "date": "2023-09-29", "authors": ["ZsuzsaKalm\u00e1r", "Attila DS\u00e1ndor", "AnamariaBalea", "Silvia-DianaBor\u015fan", "Ioana AdrianaMatei", "Angela MonicaIonic\u0103", "C\u0103lin MirceaGherman", "Andrei DanielMihalca", "AnamariaCozma-Petru\u021b", "VioricaMircean", "AdrianaGy\u00f6rke"], "doi": "10.1186/s12917-023-03729-7\n10.1017/S0031182013001509\n10.1016/S0020-7519(00)00124-7\n10.1016/j.siny.2007.01.011\n10.1590/s1984-29612014092\n10.1016/S0304-4017(02)00034-1\n10.1051/parasite/2011184345\n10.1186/s13071-020-04445-z\n10.1186/s13071-016-1432-6\n10.3389/fvets.2020.00461\n10.1089/vbz.2009.0238\n10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.07.018\n10.1016/0169-5347(88)90006-7\n10.1017/S0031182007003320\n10.1186/s13071-019-3713-3\n10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.07.015\n10.3390/parasitologia1020005\n10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.11.062\n10.1007/s00436-020-06984-x\n10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.01.005\n10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.07.024\n10.1645/13-483.1\n10.1186/s13071-019-3842-8\n10.1017/S0031182003004189\n10.1016/j.ijpara.2018.11.004\n10.3201/eid2112.141711\n10.2478/srj-2014-0012\n10.5604/1232-1966.1108582\n10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.09.001\n10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.04.018\n10.1007/s00436-010-1905-z\n10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.05.030\n10.1186/s13071-015-0922-2\n10.1017/S0031182013001522\n10.1016/S0304-4017(97)00227-6\n10.1017/S0031182005008784\n10.1002/vms3.255\n10.1080/09603120701540856\n10.3390/ani11041048\n10.1017/S0031182014001760\n10.1017/S0031182011000904\n10.1016/S0020-7519(99)00170-8"}

{"title": "Multiomics analyses reveal dynamic bioenergetic pathways and functional remodeling of the heart during intermittent fasting.", "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in both animals and humans, and can protect the heart against ischemic injury in models of myocardial infarction. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear. To shed light on the molecular and cellular adaptations of the heart to IF, we conducted comprehensive system-wide analyses of the proteome, phosphoproteome, and transcriptome, followed by functional analysis. Using advanced mass spectrometry, we profiled the proteome and phosphoproteome of heart tissues obtained from mice that were maintained on daily 12- or 16 hr fasting, every-other-day fasting, or ad libitum control feeding regimens for 6 months. We also performed RNA sequencing to evaluate whether the observed molecular responses to IF occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Our analyses revealed that IF significantly affected pathways that regulate cyclic GMP signaling, lipid and amino acid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell death, and inflammation. Furthermore, we found that the impact of IF on different metabolic processes varied depending on the length of the fasting regimen. Short IF regimens showed a higher correlation of pathway alteration, while longer IF regimens had an inverse correlation of metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and immune processes. Additionally, functional echocardiographic analyses demonstrated that IF enhances stress-induced cardiac performance. Our systematic multi-omics study provides a molecular framework for understanding how IF impacts the heart's function and its vulnerability to injury and disease.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2023-09-28", "authors": ["Thiruma VArumugam", "AsfaAlli-Shaik", "Elisa ALiehn", "SharmeleeSelvaraji", "LutingPoh", "VismithaRajeev", "YoonsukCho", "YongeunCho", "JonghoKim", "JoonkiKim", "Hannah L FSwa", "David Tan ZhiHao", "ChutimaRattanasopa", "David Yang-WeiFann", "David CastanoMayan", "Gavin Yong-QuanNg", "Sang-HaBaik", "KarthikMallilankaraman", "MathiasGelderblom", "Grant RDrummond", "Christopher GSobey", "Brian KKennedy", "Roshni RSingaraja", "Mark PMattson", "Dong-GyuJo", "JayanthaGunaratne"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.89214\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.563817\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.04.015\n10.1002/ana.21798\n10.1152/physrev.00043.2016\n10.1074/jbc.M115.681767\n10.2741/brushia\n10.1113/JP272333\n10.1016/j.mad.2011.06.006\n10.1093/nar/gkq1039\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.10.013\n10.17219/acem/67968\n10.1186/1471-2105-13-S16-S12\n10.1074/mcp.M113.031591\n10.1016/j.cmet.2016.07.010\n10.1101/gad.183500\n10.1056/NEJMra1905136\n10.1093/gerona/gly139\n10.1096/fj.15-276337\n10.1124/pr.117.013896\n10.2337/db16-1519\n10.1002/mnfr.201700756\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1063768\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226928\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.07.008\n10.1046/j.1365-2443.2001.00419.x\n10.1038/ijo.2010.171\n10.1017/S0007114513000792\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.02.051\n10.1093/nar/gkr1122\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1152/ajpendo.00042.2011\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.12.005\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.11.023\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.10.027\n10.3390/ijms19113464\n10.1093/hmg/ddy057\n10.1016/j.isci.2020.100868\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.09.086\n10.1093/nar/gkw377\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq466\n10.1007/s40471-018-0160-1\n10.1038/nbt.3955\n10.1210/mend.14.12.0575\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000007\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.301633\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2018.08.008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00339.2017\n10.1007/s10974-006-9077-2\n10.1111/jnc.13176\n10.1038/s41467-019-09897-1\n10.1161/JAHA.118.010866\n10.1096/fj.05-5263com\n10.1161/01.RES.0000143901.37063.2f\n10.1111/jnc.13868\n10.1096/fj.201701378RR\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2004.12.007\n10.1016/j.arr.2016.10.005\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.05.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0013984\n10.1172/JCI13020\n10.1038/nmeth.1938\n10.1146/annurev-nutr-071816-064916\n10.1177/1559325819876780\n10.1074/jbc.TM118.004165\n10.1111/bjh.14283\n10.1074/mcp.M116.065524\n10.1038/nprot.2007.261\n10.1007/s40520-013-0117-7\n10.1038/ncomms13250\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.02.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302022\n10.1038/srep25844\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2021.01.018\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2012.00825.x\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.07.016\n10.1126/science.291.5503.490\n10.1007/s10741-007-9062-x\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.04.010\n10.1038/nprot.2016.136\n10.1038/nmeth.3901\n10.1002/jmri.23854\n10.1016/j.metabol.2012.09.005\n10.1096/fj.02-0996fje\n10.1093/jn/133.6.1921\n10.1152/ajpheart.00932.2003\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.01.020\n10.1111/jnc.12656\n10.1152/ajpheart.00685.2011\n10.1016/j.peptides.2011.09.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050376\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19990915)57:6<830::AID-JNR8>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1146/annurev.nutr.27.061406.093722\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139"}

{"title": "Effect of morphological change on the maturation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissue in rotating flow culture.", "abstract": "Understanding the critical factors for the maturation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiac tissue is important for further development of culture techniques. Rotating flow culture, where the tissues float in the culture medium by balancing its gravitational settling and the medium flow generated in rotating disk-shaped culture vessels, is one of culture systems used for tissue engineering. It has previously been demonstrated that rotating flow culture leads to the formation of matured cardiac tissue with higher levels of function and structure than the other culture systems. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the maturation of cardiac tissue remain unclear. This study investigated the maturation process of hiPSC-derived cardiac tissue in rotating flow culture with a focus on morphological changes in the tissue, which is a trigger for maturation.\nThe cardiac tissue, which consisted of cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs, was cultured on the 3D scaffold of poly (lactic-\nThe ratio of the projected area of tissue significantly decreased from Day 0 to Day 3 due to tissue shrinkage. In contrast, Western blot analysis revealed that maturation protein markers of cardiomyocytes significantly increased after Day 3. In addition, in rotating flow culture, flat-shaped nuclei and fiber-like cytoskeletal structures were distributed in the surface region of tissue where medium flow was continuously applied. Moreover, Lamin A/C, which are generally formed in differentiated cells owing to mechanical force across the cytoskeleton and critically affect the maturation of cardiomyocytes, were significantly formed in the tissue of rotating flow culture.\nIn this study, we found that spatial heterogeneity of tissue structure and tissue shrinkage occurred in rotating flow culture, which was not observed in static suspension culture. Moreover, from the quantitative analysis, it was also suggested that tissue shrinkage in rotating flow culture contributed its following tissue maturation. These findings showed one of the important characteristics of rotating flow culture which was not revealed in previous studies.", "journal": "Regenerative therapy", "date": "2023-09-28", "authors": ["AkihiroHashida", "TaroNakazato", "ToshimasaUemura", "LiLiu", "ShigeruMiyagawa", "YoshikiSawa", "MasahiroKino-Oka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.reth.2023.09.002\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.03.012"}

{"title": "Advantages and Prospective Implications of Smart Materials in Tissue Engineering: Piezoelectric, Shape Memory, and Hydrogels.", "abstract": "Conventional biomaterial is frequently used in the biomedical sector for various therapies, imaging, treatment, and theranostic functions. However, their properties are fixed to meet certain applications. Smart materials respond in a controllable and reversible way, modifying some of their properties because of external stimuli. However, protein-based smart materials allow modular protein domains with different functionalities and responsive behaviours to be easily combined. Wherein, these \"smart\" behaviours can be tuned by amino acid identity and sequence. This review aims to give an insight into the design of smart materials, mainly protein-based piezoelectric materials, shape-memory materials, and hydrogels, as well as highlight the current progress and challenges of protein-based smart materials in tissue engineering.

A total of 40 Wistar rats were divided into five groups: normal control (NC), diabetic control (DC), diabetic + aerobic training (DAT), diabetic + vitamin D3 (DVD), and diabetic + aerobic training + vitamin D3 (DVDAT). The rats underwent eight weeks of aerobic training with an intensity of 60% maximum running speed for one hour, along with weekly subcutaneous injections of 10,000 units of vitamin D3.

{"title": "Effects of an L-Leucine-Rich Diet on Liver and Kidneys in a Doxorubicin Toxicity Model.", "abstract": "Supplements and diets containing L-leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, have been considered beneficial for controlling oxidative stress and maintaining cardiac tissue in toxicity models using doxorubicin, a drug widely used in cancer treatment. However, there is a lack of studies in the literature that assess the effects of this diet on other organs and tissues, such as the liver and kidneys. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of a leucine-rich diet on the liver and kidneys of healthy rats submitted to the doxorubicin toxicity model by analyzing biomarkers of oxidative stress and histological parameters. The animals were divided into four groups: naive, doxorubicin, L-leucine, and doxorubicin + L-leucine, and the diet was standardized with 5% L-leucine and a dose of 7.5 mg/kg of doxorubicin. We evaluated tissue injury parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress, including enzymes, antioxidant profile, and oxidized molecules, in the liver and kidneys. Although some studies have indicated benefits of a diet rich in L-leucine for the muscle tissue of animals that received doxorubicin, our results showed that the liver was the most affected organ by the L-leucine-rich diet since the diet reduced its antioxidant defenses and increased the deposit of collagen and fat in the hepatic tissue.

The present study aimed to evaluate the cardioprotective role of \u03b1-Bisabolol (BSB) in DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity in rats and the underlying pharmacological and molecular mechanisms. DOX (12.5 mg/kg, single dose) was injected intraperitoneally into the rats for induction of acute cardiotoxicity. BSB was given orally to rats (25 mg/kg, p.o. twice daily) for a duration of five days. DOX administration induced cardiac dysfunction as evidenced by altered body weight, hemodynamics, and release of cardio-specific diagnostic markers. The occurrence of oxidative stress was evidenced by a significant decline in antioxidant defense along with a rise in lipid peroxidation and hyperlipidemia. Additionally, DOX also increased the levels and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators, as well as activated NF-\u03baB/MAPK signaling in the heart, following alterations in the Nrf2/Keap-1/HO-1 and Akt/mTOR/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling. DOX also perturbed NLRP3 inflammasome activation-mediated pyroptosis in the myocardium of rats. Furthermore, histopathological studies revealed cellular alterations in the myocardium. On the contrary, treatment with BSB has been observed to preserve the myocardium and restore all the cellular, molecular, and structural perturbations in the heart tissues of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Results of the present study clearly demonstrate the protective role of BSB against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, which is attributed to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihyperlipidemic effects resulting from favorable modulation of numerous cellular signaling regulatory pathways, viz., Nrf2/Keap-1/HO-1, Akt/mTOR/GSK-3\u03b2, NF-\u03baB/p38/MAPK, and NLRP3 inflammasomes, in countering the cascades of oxidative stress and inflammation.

{"title": "DLK1 overexpression improves sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in mice through the TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signaling pathway and MMPs.", "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious inflammatory disease caused by bacterial infection. Cardiovascular dysfunction and remodeling are serious complications of sepsis, which can significantly affect sepsis patients' mortality. Delta-like homologue 1 (DLK1) has been reported could inhibit cardiac myofibroblast differentiation. However, the function of DLK1 in sepsis is unknown. In the present study, the DLK1 expression was first identified based on the online dataset GSE79962 analysis and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model. DLK1 expression was significantly reduced in septic heart tissues. In septic mouse heart, CLP operation decreased the fractional shortening (EF) (%) and ejection fraction (FS) (%) and caused significant edema, disordered myofilament arrangement, and degradation and necrosis in myocardial cells; CLP operation also increased collagen deposition and elevated the protein levels of fibrotic markers (\u03b1-SMA and F-actin).

These cells' limitations, including restricted access to primary material and its manipulation have been overcome by the advancement of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and their ability to differentiate towards the cardiac stromal population. C-MSCs derived from hiPSCs make it possible to work with virtually unlimited numbers of cells that are genetically identical to the cells of origin. We performed in vitro experiments on primary stromal cells (Primary) and hiPSC-derived stromal cells (hiPSC-D) to compare them as tools to model ACM. Both Primary and hiPSC-D cells expressed mesenchymal surface markers and possessed typical MSC differentiation potentials. hiPSC-D expressed desmosomal genes and proteins and shared a similar transcriptomic profile with Primary cells. Furthermore, ACM hiPSC-D exhibited higher propensity to accumulate lipid droplets and collagen compared to healthy control cells, similar to their primary counterparts. Therefore, both Primary and hiPSC-D cardiac stromal cells obtained from ACM patients can be used to model aspects of the disease.

Therefore, the present study investigated the modulatory role of GPCRs (41 and 43) by acetate on cardiac mitochondrial status in PCOS rat model. Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly allotted into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Polycystic ovarian syndrome was induced by administering letrozole (1\u00a0mg/kg p.o.) once daily for 21 days, thereafter the animals were treated with 200\u00a0mg/kg (oral gavage) of acetate for six weeks. Letrozole-induced PCOS rats showed elevated circulating testosterone and anti-mullerian hormone, with multiple ovarian cysts. In addition, these rats also manifested insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased plasma triglyceride (TG), TG/HDLc and decreased HDLc, as well as elevated level of cardiac TG, glycogen, glycogen synthase, and plasma/cardiac NF-kB, TNF-\u03b1, and SDF-1. Cardiac MDA and caspase-6 increased, while plasma/cardiac NrF2 decreased in PCOS animals. A decrease in mitochondrial ATP synthase, ATP/AMP ratio, CPT2 and SDH, and increased HDAC2 were observed in PCOS rats with decreased level of GPCR 41 and 43 when compared with control. Immunohistochemical evaluation of cardiac tissue also showed decrease expression of PROKR1 in PCOS rats compared with control rats. However, treatment with acetate reversed these systemic, cardiac and mitochondrial anomalies. The present results suggest the therapeutic benefit of acetate, an HDAC2i against cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in PCOS rat model, by attenuating cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis and these effects are accompanied by modulation of GPCR41 and 43 as well as increased expression of PROKR1.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2023-09-28", "authors": ["Stephanie EAreloegbe", "Kehinde SOlaniyi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.09.061"}
{"title": "Linderalactone mitigates diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice via suppressing the MAPK/ATF6 pathway.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a challenging diabetic complication that manifests as chronic inflammation. Yet, the mechanism underlying diabetes-associated myocardial injury is not fully understood. We investigated the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of linderalactone, a natural compound that can prevent diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy in mice. Diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (120\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). Diabetic mice were administrated with linderalactone (2.5 or 5\u00a0mg/kg) by gavage for five weeks. Harvested heart tissues were then subjected to RNA-sequencing analysis to explore the potential mechanism of linderalactone. Linderalactone prevented heart dysfunction by inhibiting myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation, without altering blood glucose. RNA-sequencing indicated that linderalactone exerted its cardioprotective effects mainly by affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway. Linderalactone also suppressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated by the diabetes-activated MAPKs/ATF6 pathway, thereby reducing myocardial hypertrophy and inflammation in heart tissues and in cultured cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of MAPKs or a deficiency of ATF6 in cardiomyocytes mimicked the linderalactone-associated decreases in high glucose-induced hypertrophy and inflammation. Linderalactone showed beneficial effects in alleviating diabetic cardiomyopathy, in part by modulating the MAPK/ATF6 signaling pathway to mitigate myocardial hypertrophy and inflammation.

We reviewed medical records and performed cardiac tissue histopathological evaluation, electron microscopy, immunohistochemical assays, RT-qPCR for YF virus (YFV)-RNA, and proteomics analysis on inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers.\nSeventy-three confirmed YF cases with a median age of 48 (34-60) years were included. We observed myocardial fibrosis in 68 (93.2%) patients; cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in 68 (93.2%); endothelial alterations in 67 (91.8%); fiber necrosis in 50 (68.5%); viral myocarditis in 9 (12.3%); and secondary myocarditis in 5 (6.8%). Four out of five patients with 17DD vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease presented with myocarditis. The cardiac conduction system showed edema, hemorrhages and endothelial fibrinoid necrosis. Immunohistochemistry detected CD68-positive inflammatory interstitial cells and YFV antigens in endothelial and inflammatory cells. YFV-RNA was detected positive in 95.7% of the cardiac samples.

Despite its quiescent state during adulthood, the adult epicardium reactivates and recapitulates many aspects of embryonic cardiogenesis in response to cardiac injury, thereby supporting cardiac tissue remodeling. Thus, the epicardium has been considered a crucial source of cell progenitors that offers an important contribution to cardiac development and injured hearts. Although several studies have provided evidence regarding cell fate determination in the epicardium, to date, it is unclear whether epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) come from specific, and predetermined, epicardial cell subpopulations or if they are derived from a common progenitor. In recent years, different approaches have been used to study cell heterogeneity within the epicardial layer using different experimental models.

{"title": "Nanocomposite Hydrogels and Extracellular Matrix-Advantages and Associated Risks.", "abstract": "Hydrogels can be considered as mimics of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Through integrins, the cytoskeleton is connected to the ECM, and cytoskeleton tension depends on ECM stiffness. A number of age-related diseases depend on cellular processes related to cytoskeleton function. Some examples of cancer initiation and progression and heart disease in relation to ECM stiffness have been analyzed. The incorporation of rigid particles into the ECM can increase ECM stiffness and promote the formation of internal residual stresses. Water migration, changes in water binding energy to biomactomolecules, and changes in the state of water from tightly bound water to free and loosely bound water lead to changes in the stiffness of the ECM. Cardiac tissue engineering, ECM stiffness and cancer, the equivalence of ECM stiffness, oxidative stress, inflammation, multi-layer polyelectrolyte complex hydrogels and bioprinting, residual internal stresses, viscoelastic hydrogels, hydrogel nanocomposites, and the effect of water have been reported. Special attention has been paid to the role of bound water and internal stresses in ECM stiffness. The risks related to rigid particle incorporation into the ECM have been discussed. The potential effect of polyphenols, chitosan, and chitosan oligosaccharide on ECM stiffness and the potential for anti-TNF-\u03b1 and anti-NF-\u03baB therapies have been discussed.", "journal": "Gels (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-09-27", "authors": ["GarryKerch"], "doi": "10.3390/gels9090754\n10.1002/adma.200501612\n10.1002/bit.25160\n10.1002/adma.201303233\n10.1016/j.mattod.2015.10.005\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.108208\n10.1038/am.2014.19\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2019.04.008\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2022.111336\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.05.027\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00175-8\n10.1073/pnas.94.25.13661\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.12.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.01.065\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.051\n10.1073/pnas.1904660116\n10.1002/bit.22361\n10.3389/fchem.2018.00439\n10.1016/j.mser.2020.100543\n10.18063/ijb.v4i1.126\n10.1007/BF00614791\n10.1039/D2SM00505K\n10.1016/j.actbio.2023.01.039\n10.1517/17460441.2015.1058775\n10.1038/s41586-020-2612-2\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.02.004\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.119403\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2014.09.001\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.123453\n10.1186/s12989-017-0199-z\n10.1038/nmat4009\n10.1039/C8SC02100G\n10.1038/nrm2597\n10.1007/s10973-011-2029-0\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.187\n10.1016/j.nano.2017.08.012\n10.3390/polym12061362\n10.3390/encyclopedia1010020\n10.1063/4.0000021\n10.1039/C6CP05198G\n10.1039/D2CP00621A\n10.1002/anie.201713318\n10.1529/biophysj.106.089003\n10.1016/j.bioadv.2023.213563\n10.1039/B711887B\n10.1002/adhm.202101309\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.817391\n10.1016/j.mtbio.2023.100607\n10.1073/pnas.1814204116\n10.1002/smll.202200364\n10.1038/srep20395\n10.1074/jbc.M112.431411\n10.1038/onc.2008.88\n10.3390/biology12050729\n10.18632/oncotarget.25891\n10.3892/or.2015.3767\n10.1023/A:1014594825502\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.035\n10.1038/nature10137\n10.1016/j.ccell.2016.05.005\n10.3390/nu11030578\n10.3390/ijms24021187\n10.3390/nu11010053\n10.1016/j.foodres.2010.11.034\n10.1016/j.jcs.2004.08.005\n10.3892/mmr.2015.4690\n10.3390/biom12010082\n10.1021/acsomega.2c07018\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.01.012\n10.3892/mmr.2018.9589\n10.1016/j.jsbmb.2014.01.009\n10.34172/apb.2022.014\n10.3390/cancers14174316\n10.3390/ijms22115624\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.11.018\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.1126774\n10.3390/cancers13051164\n10.3390/pharmaceutics13091487\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.601641\n10.1186/ar300\n10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102741\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.243121\n10.1155/2019/6578492\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.12.005\n10.1007/s40292-018-0252-5\n10.1016/j.jash.2013.09.001"}

To this end, extracellular-matrix (ECM)-derived hydrogels can be used to develop scaffolds that closely mimic the complex 3D environments for cell culture. This study presents a novel cardiac bioink based on hydrogels exclusively derived from decellularized porcine myocardium loaded with human-bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Hence, the hydrogel can be used to develop cell-laden cardiac patches without the need to add other biomaterials or use additional crosslinkers. The scaffold ultrastructure and mechanical properties of the bioink were characterized to optimize its production, specifically focusing on the matrix enzymatic digestion time. The cells were cultured in 3D within the developed hydrogels to assess their response. The results indicate that the hydrogels fostered inter-cell and cell-matrix crosstalk after 1 week of culture.

{"title": "A novel biomimetic nanofibrous cardiac tissue engineering scaffold with adjustable mechanical and electrical properties based on poly(glycerol sebacate) and polyaniline.", "abstract": "Biomaterial tissue engineering scaffolds play a critical role in providing mechanical support, promoting cells growth and proliferation. However, due to the insulation and inappropriate stiffness of most biomaterials, there is an unmet need to engineer a biomimetic nanofibrous cardiac tissue engineering scaffold with tailorable mechanical and electrical properties. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility to generate a novel type of biocompatible fibrous scaffolds by blending elastic poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) and conductive polyaniline (PANI) with the help of a nontoxic carrier polymer, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Aligned and random PGS/PANI scaffolds are successfully obtained after electrospinning, cross-linking, water and ethanol wash. Incorporating of different concentrations of PANI into PGS fibers, the fibrous sheets show enhanced conductivity and slower degradation rates while maintaining the favorable hemocompatibility. The elastic modulus of the PGS/PANI scaffolds is in the range of 0.65-2.18\u00a0MPa under wet conditions, which is similar to that of natural myocardium. All of these fibrous mats show good cell viability and were able to promote adhesion and proliferation of H9c2 cells. Furthermore, the in vivo host responses of both random and aligned scaffolds confirm their good biocompatibility. Therefore, these PGS/PANI scaffolds have great potential for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Materials today.

Acrylamide (ACD), a pervasive chemical in food and the environment, has been linked to cardiac toxicity. Therefore, this study examined the probable protective effect of green synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (GS-ZNPs) against ACD-oral exposure-induced cardiac damage in rats. For 60\u00a0days, 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into four sets that orally administered distilled water, 10-mg GS-ZNP/kg b.w., 20-mg ACD/kg b.w., or GS-ZNP\u2009+\u2009ACD. Then, cardiac damage indicators comprising CPK, CK-MB, cTn, and LDH were assessed. Besides, cardiac tissues' architecture, oxidative stress indicators, and Zn content were evaluated. The mRNA expression of the ERS-related genes, including ATF3, ATF4, ATF6, XBP-1, CHOP, JNKs, and BiP, were determined. Moreover, ERS-dependent anti-apoptotic (BCL-2) and apoptotic (Caspase-3 and BAX) genes mRNA expression were analyzed. The results showed that GS-ZNP significantly alleviated the increased ACD-induced serum cardiac damage indicators, MDA tissue content, and histopathological changes. Furthermore, the ACD-induced reduction of antioxidants and Zn heart contents were significantly reestablished by GS-ZNP. Furthermore, the ACD-induced upregulation of the ERS-encoding genes and apoptotic genes was reversed by GS-ZNP. Besides, the ACD-induced BCL-2 downregulation was counteracted by GS-ZNP. Overall, GS-ZNP could be a biologically potent compound to alleviate ACD's cardiotoxic effects, possibly by controlling the ERS and apoptosis-related genes and antioxidant activity.", "journal": "Biological trace element research", "date": "2023-09-27", "authors": ["ManalAlosaimi", "Yasmina MAbd-Elhakim", "Amany Abdel-RahmanMohamed", "Mohamed M MMetwally", "TarekKhamis", "Wafa SAlansari", "Areej AEskandrani", "Walaa MEssawi", "Marwa MAwad", "Rehab A AEl-Shaer", "SarahIbrahim", "Mohamed ANassan", "Aya ShMetwally"], "doi": "10.1007/s12011-023-03855-1"}

This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD)-mediated oxidative stress and inflammation in hypertensive cardiac remodeling. The hypertensive murine model was established through angiotensin-II injection, and hypertensive mice underwent overexpressed CEBPD vector injection, cardiac function evaluation, and observation of histological changes. The cell model was established by angiotensin-II treatment and transfected with overexpressed CEBPD vector. Cell viability and surface area and oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species/superoxide dismutase/lactate dehydrogenase/malondialdehyde) were assessed, and inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2/IL-6/IL-10) were determined both in vivo and in vitro . The levels of CEBPD, miR-96-5p, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R), natriuretic peptide B, and natriuretic peptide A, collagen I, and collagen III in tissues and cells were determined. The binding relationships of CEBPD/miR-96-5p/IP3R 3' untranslated region were validated. CEBPD was reduced in cardiac tissue of hypertensive mice, and CEBPD upregulation improved cardiac function and attenuated fibrosis and hypertrophy, along with reductions of reactive oxygen species/lactate dehydrogenase/malondialdehyde/TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2/IL-6 and increases in superoxide dismutase/IL-10. CEBPD enriched on the miR-96-5p promoter to promote miR-96-5p expression, whereas CEBPD and miR-96-5p negatively regulated IP3R. miR-96-5p silencing/IP3R overexpression reversed the alleviative role of CEBPD overexpression in hypertensive mice.

{"title": "ROR2 deficit may induce the tetralogy of Fallot via down-regulating of \u03b2-catenin/SOX3/HSPA6 in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the highly conventional appearance of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Our study aimed to assess the involvement of receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) in TOF and elucidate the specific mechanism. Upon investigation of human tissue samples, we observed a decrease in ROR2 expression in TOF patients compared to healthy control individuals. Transcriptome analysis revealed diminished ROR2 expression in TOF pathological samples relative to normal tissues. Of the 2246 genes that exhibited altered expression, 886 were upregulated, while 1360 were down-regulated. KEGG analysis and GO analysis of the differentially expressed genes indicated that these genes were significantly enriched in the Wnt signalling pathway, apoptosis and cardiac development function. Importantly, ROR2 was the only gene shared among the three pathways. Furthermore, interference with ROR2 promotes apoptosis and curtails cell proliferation in vitro. The knockdown of the ROR2 gene in AC16 cells resulted in a significant decrease in Edu-positive cells. Flow cytometry studies indicated an increase in the percentage of cells in the S phase. In contrast, the G2/M cell cycle transition was blocked in the ROR2-knockdown group, leading to a significant increase in apoptosis. Moreover, the CCK-8 cell viability assay demonstrated a reduced proliferation in the ROR2-knockdown group. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro data indicated that the expression of HSPA6 (Recombinant Heat Shock 70\u2009kDa Protein6), an essential gene enriched in cardiac tissue and associated with apoptosis, was down-regulated following ROR2 knockdown mediated by the \u03b2-catenin/SOX3 signalling pathway.

{"title": "Zinc nanoparticles ameliorated obesity-induced cardiovascular disease: role of metabolic syndrome and iron overload.", "abstract": "Obesity is a complicated disease characterized by abundant fat accumulation. It is associated with cardiovascular disease. The current study aimed to appreciate the role of synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) (18.72 nm in size) in curbing cardiovascular disease in an obesity model of a high fat/sucrose diet in male rats. For 16 weeks, 24 rats were fed a high-fat diet and a 25% sucrose solution to develop obesity, and after that, the rats were randomly allocated into four groups of rats. Group 1 served as the control group and consisted of normal, non-obese rats. Group 2 comprised obese rats that were injected with an equivalent volume of a neutral substance, serving as vehicle control. In Group 3 or 4, obese rats were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 5 or 10mg/kg of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) for eight weeks. The treatment of obese rats with ZnONPs decreased plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), resistin, ENA78, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL6), and C reactive protein (CRP). Also, the remediation of obese rats with ZnONPs led to a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI), body weight gain, leptin, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (Low-density lipoprotein), glucose, and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Moreover, ZnONPs treatment lowered troponin, creatine phosphokinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac or adipose tissue iron content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) either in blood or heart tissue. Otherwise, treating obese rats with ZnONPs enhanced plasma adiponectin levels, cardiac-reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD).

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of calpain inhibition (CI) on mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress in a swine model of chronic myocardial ischemia and metabolic syndrome.\nYorkshire swine were fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks to induce metabolic syndrome then underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor to the left circumflex artery. Three weeks later, animals received: no drug (control, \"CON\"; n= 7); a low-dose calpain inhibitor (0.12\u00a0mg/kg; \"LCI\", n= 7); or high-dose calpain inhibitor (0.25\u00a0mg/kg; \"HCI\", n=7). Treatment continued for 5 weeks, followed by tissue harvest. Cardiac tissue was assayed for protein carbonyl content, as well as antioxidant and mitochondrial protein expression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial respiration was measured in H9c2 cells following exposure to normoxia or hypoxia (1%) for 24\u00a0h with or without CI.\nIn ischemic myocardial tissue, CI was associated with decreased total oxidative stress compared to control. CI was also associated with increased expression of mitochondrial proteins superoxide dismutase 1, SDHA, and pyruvate dehydrogenase compared to control. 100\u00a0nM of calpain inhibitor decreased ROS levels and respiration in both normoxic and hypoxic H9c2 cardiomyoblasts.\nIn the setting of metabolic syndrome, CI improves oxidative stress in chronically ischemic myocardial tissue.

{"title": "Speckle-Tracking Strain Analysis for Mapping Spatiotemporal Contractility of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) hold tremendous potential for cardiovascular disease modeling, drug screening, personalized medicine, and pathophysiology studies. The availability of a robust protocol and functional assay for studying phenotypic behavior of hiPSC-CMs is essential for establishing an in vitro disease model. Many heart diseases manifest due to changes in the mechanical strain of cardiac tissue. Therefore, non-invasive evaluation of the contractility properties of hiPSC-CMs remains crucial to gain an insight into the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases. Speckle tracking-based strain analysis is an efficient non-invasive method that uses video microscopy and image analysis of beating hiPSC-CMs for quantitative evaluation of mechanical contractility properties. This article presents step-by-step protocols for extracting quantitative contractility properties of an hiPSC-CM system obtained from five members of a family, of whom three were affected by DiGeorge syndrome, using speckle tracking-based strain analysis. The hiPSCs from the family members were differentiated and purified into hiPSC-CMs using metabolic selection. Time-lapse images of hiPSC-CMs were acquired using high-spatial-resolution and high-time-resolution phase-contrast video microscopy. Speckled images were characterized by evaluating the cross-correlation coefficient, speckle size, speckle contrast, and speckle quality of the images. The optimum parameters of the speckle tracking algorithm were determined by performing sensitivity analysis concerning computation time, effective mapping area, average contraction velocity, and strain. Furthermore, the hiPSC-CM response to adrenaline was evaluated to validate the sensitivity of the strain analysis algorithm. Then, we applied speckle tracking-based strain analysis to characterize the dynamic behavior of patient-specific hiPSC-CMs from the family members affected/unaffected by DiGeorge syndrome. Here, we report an efficient and manipulation-free method to analyze the contraction displacement vector and velocity field, contraction-relaxation strain rate, and contractile cycles. Implementation of this method allows for quantitative analysis of the contractile phenotype characteristics of hiPSC-CMs to distinguish possible cardiac manifestation of DiGeorge syndrome. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

{"title": "Comprehensive Metabolomic Analysis of Human Heart Tissue Enabled by Parallel Metabolite Extraction and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.", "abstract": "The heart contracts incessantly and requires a constant supply of energy, utilizing numerous metabolic substrates such as fatty acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids to supply its high energy demands. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of various metabolites is urgently needed for understanding cardiac metabolism; however, complete metabolome analyses remain challenging due to the broad range of metabolite polarities which makes extraction and detection difficult. Herein, we implemented parallel metabolite extractions and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the human heart metabolome. To capture the diverse range of metabolite polarities, we first performed six parallel liquid-liquid extractions (three monophasic, two biphasic, and one triphasic extractions) of healthy human donor heart tissue. Next, we utilized two complementary MS platforms for metabolite detection - direct-infusion ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (DI-FTICR) and high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem MS (LC-Q-TOF MS/MS). Using DI-FTICR MS, 9,521 metabolic features were detected where 7,699 were assigned a chemical formula and 1,756 were assigned an annotated by accurate mass assignment. Using LC-Q-TOF MS/MS, 21,428 metabolic features were detected where 626 metabolites were identified based on fragmentation matching against publicly available libraries. Collectively, 2276 heart metabolites were identified in this study which span a wide range of polarities including polar (benzenoids, alkaloids and derivatives and nucleosides) as well as non-polar (phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitines, and fatty acids) compounds.

{"title": "Effect and mechanism of Qing Gan Zi Shen decoction on heart damage induced by obesity and hypertension.", "abstract": "Qing Gan Zi Shen Decoction (QGZS) is a traditional Chinese formula. It has been extensively used for decades in the treatment of hypertension combined with metabolic diseases, but its cardioprotective effects and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.\nTo explore the cardioprotective effects and potential mechanisms of QGZS in an animal model of obese hypertension.\nIn this study, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were utilized as an animal model to examine the effects of a high-fat diet and two concentrations of QGZS. Echocardiography, hematoxylin eosin (H&E) staining, and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining were employed to assess the cardiac structure and function of the SHRs throughout a 16-week therapy period. Furthermore, Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were employed to identify the levels of Nrf2 expression in the mitochondria, cytoplasm, and nucleus of the myocardium. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were utilized to measure mitochondrial morphology and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, respectively. Furthermore, Western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) techniques were employed to quantify the levels of marker proteins associated with myocardial fibrosis, cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nQGZS inhibited weight gain and depressed systolic and mean arterial pressures in high-fat-fed SHRs. Echocardiographic results demonstrated that QGZS prevented the increase in left ventricular mass, restricted the growth of left ventricular diameter, and improved ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and the ratio of early diastolic peak velocity of transmitral flow (E) to late diastolic peak velocity (A) in high-fat-fed SHRs. This suggested that QGZS prevented ventricular remodeling and protected cardiac systolic and diastolic functions. H&E and WGA staining showed that QGZS improved cardiomyocyte disorders and restricted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Oridonin (Ori), a natural tetracycline diterpenoid, has shown cardiac protective effect; however, its role in DIC remains unclear. This study investigates the protective effect of Ori against DIC and elucidates its underlying molecular mechanisms. The results demonstrate that Ori significantly alleviated DIC by improving myocardial structure, reducing the proportion of apoptotic cells, and alleviating the myocardial oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction both in vivo and in vitro. Doxorubicin significantly decreased Sirt6 and PGC1\u03b1 levels in cardiac tissues, which was reversed by Ori. Furthermore, Sirt6 overexpression significantly improved myocardial structure and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells by reducing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function. The protective effect of Ori is neutralized by the Sirt6 inhibitor OSS_128167, evidenced by downregulated mRNA and protein expression of PGC1\u03b1. The transcription factor E2F1 was upregulated by doxorubicin, leading to decreased Sirt6 expression-an effect mitigated by Ori. Molecular docking simulations indicate direct binding between Ori and specific amino acid residues on E2F1 through hydroxyl bonds.

At present, how perturbations in CL abundance and composition lead to many debilitating clinical presentations in BTHS patients have not been fully elucidated. Inspired by our recent findings that CL is essential for optimal mitochondrial calcium uptake, we measured the levels of other biologically important metal ions in BTHS mitochondria and found that in addition to calcium, magnesium levels are significantly reduced. Consistent with this observation, we report a decreased abundance of the mitochondrial magnesium influx channel MRS2 in multiple models of BTHS including yeast, murine myoblast, and BTHS patient cells and cardiac tissue. Mechanistically, we attribute reduced steady-state levels of MRS2 to its increased turnover in CL-deficient BTHS models. By expressing Mrs2 in well-characterized yeast mutants of the phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, we demonstrate a specific requirement of CL for Mrs2 abundance and assembly. Finally, we provide in vitro evidence for the direct binding of CL with human MRS2. Together, our study has identified a critical requirement of CL for MRS2 stability and suggests perturbation of mitochondrial magnesium homeostasis as a novel contributing factor to BTHS pathology.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2023-09-18", "authors": ["AlaumyJoshi", "Vishal MGohil"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddad153"}
{"title": "Exercise ameliorating myocardial injury in type 2 diabetic rats by inhibiting excessive mitochondrial fission involving increased irisin expression and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation.", "abstract": "Though exercise generates beneficial effects on diabetes-associated cardiac damage, the underlying mechanism is largely unclear. Therefore, we prescribed a program of 8-week treadmill training for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats and determined the role of irisin signaling, via interacting with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in mediating the effects of exercise on myocardial injuries and mitochondrial fission.\nForty 8-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into groups of control (Con), diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetes plus exercise (Ex), and diabetes plus exercise and Cyclo RGDyk (ExRg). Ex and ExRg rats received 8\u2009weeks of treadmill running, and the rats in the ExRg group additionally were treated with a twice weekly injection of Cyclo RGDyk, an irisin receptor-\u03b1V/\u03b25 antagonist. At the end of the experiment, murine blood samples and heart tissues were collected and analyzed with methods of ELISA, Western blot, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, as well as immunofluorescence staining.\nExercise effectively mitigated T2DM-related hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, lipid dysmetabolism, and inflammation, which could be diminished by Cyclo RGDyk treatment. Additionally, exercise alleviated T2DM-induced myocardial injury and excessive mitochondrial fission, whereas the beneficial effects were blocked by the administration of Cyclo RGDyk. T2DM significantly decreased serum irisin concentrations and fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin gene and protein expression levels in the rat heart, whereas exercise could rescue T2DM-reduced FNDC5/irisin expression. Blocking irisin receptor signaling diminished the exercise-alleviated mitochondrial fission protein expression and elevated AMPK phosphorylation.\nExercise is effective in mitigating diabetes-related insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammation.

{"title": "Cooperative & competitive binding of anti-myosin tail antibodies revealed by super-resolution microscopy.", "abstract": "The MF30 monoclonal antibody, which binds to the myosin subfragment-2 (S2), was found to increase the extent of myofibril shortening. Yet, previous observations found no effect of this antibody on actin sliding over myosin during in vitro motility assays with purified proteins in which myosin binding protein C (MyBPC) was absent. MF30 is hypothesized to enhance the availability of myosin heads (subfragment-1 or S1) to bind actin by destabilizing the myosin S2 coiled-coil and sterically blocking S2 from binding S1. The mechanism of action likely includes MF30's substantial size, thereby inhibiting S1 heads and MyBPC from binding S2. Hypothetically, MF30 should enhance the ON state of myosin, thereby increasing muscle contraction. Our findings indicate that MF30 binds preferentially to the unfolded heavy chains of S2, displaying positive cooperativity. However, the dose-response curve of MF30's enhancement of myofibril shortening did not suggest complex interactions with S2. Single, double, and triple-stained myofibrils with increasing amounts of antibodies against myosin rods indicate a possible competition with MyBPC. Additional assays revealed decreased fluorescence intensity at the C-zone (central zone in the sarcomere, where MyBPC is located), where MyBPC may inhibit MF30 binding. Another monoclonal antibody named MF20, which binds to the light meromyosin (LMM) without affecting myofibril contraction, showed less reduction in fluorescence intensity at the C-zone in expansion microscopy than MF30. Expansion microscopy images of myofibrils labeled with MF20 revealed labeling of the A-band (anisotropic band) and a slight reduction in the labeling at the C-zone. The staining pattern obtained from the expansion microscopy image was consistent with images from photolocalization microscopy which required the synthesis of unique photoactivatable quantum dots, and Zeiss Airyscan imaging as well as alternative expansion microscopy digestion methods. Consistent with the hypothesis that MF30 competes with MyBPC binding to S2, cardiac tissue from MyBPC knockout mice was stained more intensely, especially in the C-zone, by MF30 compared to the wild type.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2023-09-16", "authors": ["Dua'aQuedan", "RohitSingh", "AmalAkel", "Andrea LBernardino", "ChristopherThang", "MithileshBhaskaruni", "AnushkaHaldankar", "Bertrand C WTanner", "Douglas DRoot"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2023.109753"}

However, current experimental methods do not expose isolated tissues to the same contraction pattern and cardiovascular loads naturally experienced by the heart. In this study, we implement a computational model of systemic-pulmonary impedance that is solved in real time and imposed on contracting isolated rat muscle tissues. This systemic-pulmonary model represents the cardiovascular system as a lumped-parameter, closed-loop circuit. The tissues performed force-length work-loop contractions where the model output informed both the shortening and restretch phases of each work-loop. We compared the muscle mechanics and energetics associated with work-loops driven by the systemic-pulmonary model with that of a model-based loading method that only accounts for shortening. We obtained results that show simultaneous changes of afterload and preload or end-diastolic length of the muscle, as compared with the static, user-defined preload as in the conventional loading method. This feature allows assessment of muscle work output, heat output, and efficiency of contraction as functions of end-diastolic length. The results reveal the behavior of cardiac muscle as a pump source to achieve load-dependent work and efficiency outputs over a wider range of loads.

Mistakes in these processes may affect cell survival, or cause cell cycle dysregulation, such as tumorigenesis, birth defects and degenerative diseases. In recent years, it has been found that histone methyltransferase DOT1L is the only H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase, which plays an important role in the process of cell fate determination through monomethylation, dimethylation and trimethylation of H3K79. DOT1L has a pro-proliferative effect in leukemia cells; however, loss of heart-specific DOT1L leads to increased proliferation of cardiac tissue. Additionally, DOT1L has carcinogenic or tumor suppressive effects in different neoplasms. At present, some DOT1L inhibitors for the treatment of MLL-driven leukemia have achieved promising results in clinical trials, but completely blocking DOT1L will also bring some side effects. Thus, this uncertainty suggests that DOT1L has a unique function in cell physiology. In this review, we summarize the primary findings of DOT1L in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.

Although the role of miR-130b-3p as an oncogene that accelerates cancer progression by suppressing ferroptosis has been demonstrated, its role in the regulation of ferroptosis and cardiac injury in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiomyopathy has not been fully clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-130b-3p remarkably improved cardiac function and ameliorated morphological damage to heart tissue in LPS-induced mice. miR-130b-3p also improved cell viability and mitochondrial function and reduced the production of lipid ROS and ferroptosis in LPS-treated H9c2 cells. In addition, miR-130b-3p significantly upregulated GPX4 expression and suppressed ACSL4 activity in LPS-induced mouse heart tissue and H9c2 cells. Mechanistically, we used database analysis to locate miR-130b-3p and confirmed its inhibitory effects on the ferroptosis-related gene ACSL4 and autophagy-related gene PRKAA1 using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. In addition, we found that miR-130b-3p inhibited the activation of autophagy by downregulating the expression of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Meanwhile, our results show that RAPA (an autophagy activator) reverses the protective effect of miR-130b-3p mimic against LPS-induced ferroptosis, while CQ (an autophagy inhibitor) plays a facilitative role, suggesting that miR-130b-3p plays an important role in the development of ferroptosis by regulating autophagy ", "journal": "International journal of biological sciences", "date": "2023-09-14", "authors": ["ZhenQi", "RuhuiLiu", "HainingJu", "MengxiHuang", "ZheLi", "WeiLi", "YongyiWang"], "doi": "10.7150/ijbs.82287"}

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of c17 in DCM.\nThe small molecular selective MyD88 inhibitor, c17, was used to evaluate the effect of MyD88 on DCM in both high concentration of glucose- and palmitic acid-stimulated macrophages and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mice.\nThe treatment of c17 in T1DM mice resulted in improved heart function and reduced cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation and fibrogenesis. RNA sequencing analysis of the heart tissues revealed that c17 effectively suppressed the inflammatory response by regulating the MyD88-dependent pathway.

However, motion artifacts caused by cardiac muscle contraction interfere with accurate measurement of fluorescence signals. Although drugs such as blebbistatin can be applied to stop cardiac tissue from contracting by uncoupling calcium-contraction, their usage prevents the study of excitation-contraction coupling and, as we show, impacts cellular structure. We therefore developed a robust method to remove motion computationally from images of contracting cardiac muscle and to map fluorescent reporters of cardiac electrophysiological activity onto images of undeformed tissue. When validated on cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both monolayers and engineered tissues, the method enabled efficient and robust reduction of motion artifact. As with pharmacologic approaches using blebbistatin for motion removal, our algorithm improved the accuracy of optical mapping, as demonstrated by spatial maps of calcium transient decay. However, unlike pharmacologic motion removal, our computational approach allowed direct analysis of calcium-contraction coupling.

These surgeries are often a palliative measure, and heart transplantation is the only definitive therapy that exists for this condition. It has been hypothesized that stem cell-based regenerative therapies could have a role in promoting cardiac tissue regeneration in HLHS patients who are undergoing palliative surgery. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that introducing pluripotent cells into the heart is safe, feasible, and capable of improving right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). However, while these approaches show great promise, there is still room for development. There is a substantial body of pre-clinical work that is focused on generating increasingly large and complex pieces of cardiac tissue in the form of cardiac patches, with the idea that these could be used to rebuild and strengthen the heart in a robust and long-lasting manner. In total, stem cell-based therapies have much to offer when it comes to improving the treatment of HLHS.", "journal": "Translational pediatrics", "date": "2023-09-11", "authors": ["RebeccaAbraham", "LucaVricella", "NarutoshiHibino"], "doi": "10.21037/tp-23-127\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.166\n10.1542/pir.2018-0005\n10.3389/fped.2021.635776\n10.1093/pch/5.4.219\n10.1097/MOP.0000000000000271\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.11.029\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.005\n10.1001/jamacardio.2018.4435\n10.1093/ejcts/ezaa155\n10.21037/tp.2019.03.01\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.655209\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304671\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.06.001\n10.1038/nm.3267\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310253\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0195\n10.1053/j.semtcvs.2020.11.002\n10.1016/j.ahj.2017.06.009\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.12.024\n10.3390/ijms231810314\n10.3390/biomedicines9050478\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.610364\n10.1186/s13019-016-0559-z\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.11.021\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121421\n10.1002/adhm.201800672\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.005\n10.1073/pnas.0908381106\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047904\n10.1016/j.healun.2015.06.001\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.026\n10.1002/term.2954"}
{"title": "Selection of key genes for dilated cardiomyopathy based on machine learning algorithms and assessment of diagnostic accuracy.", "abstract": "The mechanisms of the occurrence and progression of dilated cardiomyopathy are still unclear and further exploration is needed. The upgrading of programming languages and the improvement of biological databases have created conditions for us to explore the structural and functional information of biological molecules at the nucleic acid and protein levels, screen key pathogenic genes, and elucidate pathogenic mechanisms. This study aimed to screen key pathogenic genes using machine learning algorithms and explore the correlation between key genes and immune microenvironment through transcriptome sequencing data sets of myocardial samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, providing new ideas for elucidating the pathogenesis of the disease.\nThe transcriptome sequencing data sets of heart tissue from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE29819 and GSE21610). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between pathological and normal tissues. The key genes were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and random forest tree algorithms. The diagnostic efficiency of the key genes for the disease was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\nCompared with the normal heart tissue (control group) samples, there were 213 DEGs in the heart tissue samples of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (treat group), including 101 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes.

{"title": "Plant Polyphenols and Their Potential Benefits on Cardiovascular Health: A Review.", "abstract": "Fruits, vegetables, and other food items contain phytochemicals or secondary metabolites which may be considered non-essential nutrients but have medicinal importance. These dietary phytochemicals exhibit chemopreventive and therapeutic effects against numerous diseases. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites found in vegetables, fruits, and grains. These compounds exhibit several health benefits such as immune modulators, vasodilators, and antioxidants. This review focuses on recent studies on using dietary polyphenols to treat cardiovascular disorders, atherosclerosis, and vascular endothelium deficits. We focus on exploring the safety of highly effective polyphenols to ensure their maximum impact on cardiac abnormalities and discuss recent epidemiological evidence and intervention trials related to these properties. Kaempferol, quercetin, and resveratrol prevent oxidative stress by regulating proteins that induce oxidation in heart tissues. In addition, polyphenols modulate the tone of the endothelium of vessels by releasing nitric oxide (NO) and reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation to prevent atherosclerosis. In cardiomyocytes, polyphenols suppress the expression of inflammatory markers and inhibit the production of inflammation markers to exert an anti-inflammatory response. Consequently, heart diseases such as strokes, hypertension, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease could be prevented by dietary polyphenols.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date":

{"title": "Ryanodine Receptor Staining Identifies Viable Cardiomyocytes in Human and Rabbit Cardiac Tissue Slices.", "abstract": "In terms of preserving multicellularity and myocardial function in vitro, the cultivation of beating myocardial slices is an emerging technique in basic and translational cardiac research. It can be used, for example, for drug screening or to study pathomechanisms. Here, we describe staining for viable cardiomyocytes based on the immunofluorescence of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in human and rabbit myocardial slices. Biomimetic chambers were used for culture and measurements of contractile force. Fixable fluorophore-conjugated dextran, entering cells with a permeable membrane, was used for death staining. RyRs, nuclei and the extracellular matrix, including the t-system, were additionally stained and analyzed by confocal microscopy and image processing. We found the mutual exclusion of the RyR and dextran signals in cultivated slices. T-System density and nucleus size were reduced in RyR-negative/dextran-positive myocytes. The fraction of RyR-positive myocytes and pixels correlated with the contractile force. In RyR-positive/dextran-positive myocytes, we found irregular RyR clusters and SERCA distribution patterns, confirmed by an altered power spectrum. We conclude that RyR immunofluorescence indicates viable cardiomyocytes in vibratome-cut myocardial slices, facilitating the detection and differential structural analysis of living vs. dead or dying myocytes.

{"title": "Knockout of the Cardiac Transcription Factor NKX2-5 Results in Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Cells with Typical Purkinje Cell-like Signal Transduction and Extracellular Matrix Formation.", "abstract": "The human heart controls blood flow, and therewith enables the adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the body. The correct function of the heart is coordinated by the interplay of different cardiac cell types. Thereby, one can distinguish between cells of the working myocardium, the pace-making cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) and the conduction system cells in the AV-node, the His-bundle or the Purkinje fibres. Tissue-engineering approaches aim to generate hiPSC-derived cardiac tissues for disease modelling and therapeutic usage with a significant improvement in the differentiation quality of myocardium and pace-making cells. The differentiation of cells with cardiac conduction system properties is still challenging, and the produced cell mass and quality is poor. Here, we describe the generation of cardiac cells with properties of the cardiac conduction system, called conduction system-like cells (CSLC). As a primary approach, we introduced a CrispR-Cas9-directed knockout of the NKX2-5 gene in hiPSC. NKX2-5-deficient hiPSC showed altered connexin expression patterns characteristic for the cardiac conduction system with strong connexin 40 and connexin 43 expression and suppressed connexin 45 expression. Application of differentiation protocols for ventricular- or SAN-like cells could not reverse this connexin expression pattern, indicating a stable regulation by NKX2-5 on connexin expression. The contraction behaviour of the hiPSC-derived CSLCs was compared to hiPSC-derived ventricular- and SAN-like cells. We found that the contraction speed of CSLCs resembled the expected contraction rate of human conduction system cells. Overall contraction was reduced in differentiated cells derived from NKX2-5 knockout hiPSC. Comparative transcriptomic data suggest a specification of the cardiac subtype of CSLC that is distinctly different from ventricular or pacemaker-like cells with reduced myocardial gene expression and enhanced extracellular matrix formation for improved electrical insulation. In summary, knockout of NKX2-5 in hiPSC leads to enhanced differentiation of cells with cardiac conduction system features, including connexin expression and contraction behaviour.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-09-09", "authors": ["PaulDisse", "IsabelAymanns", "LenaM\u00fccher", "SarahSandmann", "JulianVarghese", "NadineRitter", "NathalieStrutz-Seebohm", "GuiscardSeebohm", "StefanPeischard"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms241713366\n10.1016/S0828-282X(10)71075-8\n10.1111/j.1468-0009.2008.00522.x\n10.1016/j.scr.2022.102811\n10.1016/j.scr.2022.102793\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.01.007\n10.1002/stem.1964\n10.1186/s13287-020-01602-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173222\n10.2169/internalmedicine.8575-21\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.04.033\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208041\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.942284\n10.1007/s00018-022-04435-7\n10.1186/s13287-017-0681-4\n10.1002/stem.1921\n10.1002/cpsc.20\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.04.015\n10.1161/01.RES.0000072977.86706.23\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.03.005\n10.1002/stem.3106\n10.1242/dev.120220\n10.3109/15419060109080750\n10.1093/cvr/cvn133\n10.1038/s41598-020-72966-9\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1038/nmeth.4197\n10.3389/fphar.2013.00081\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00364-9\n10.1002/aja.1002040403\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.168997\n10.1093/cvr/cvs210\n10.1242/dev.103416\n10.1161/01.RES.0000227571.84189.65\n10.1038/s41536-017-0015-2\n10.1093/cvr/cvq329\n10.1007/s10974-007-9109-6\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164093"}

Extensive attempts have been made to attenuate pathological remodeling in infarcted hearts using cardiac patches and anti-inflammatory drug delivery. In this study, we developed a paintable and adhesive hydrogel patch using dextran-aldehyde (dex-ald) and gelatin, incorporating the anti-inflammatory protein, ANGPTL4, into the hydrogel for sustained release directly to the infarcted heart to alleviate inflammation. We optimized the material composition, including polymer concentration and molecular weight, to achieve a paintable, adhesive hydrogel using 10% gelatin and 5% dex-ald, which displayed in-situ gel formation within 135\u00a0s, cardiac tissue-like modulus (40.5\u00a0kPa), suitable tissue adhesiveness (4.3\u00a0kPa), and excellent mechanical stability. ANGPTL4 was continuously released from the gelatin/dex-ald hydrogel without substantial burst release. The gelatin/dex-ald hydrogel could be conveniently painted onto the beating heart and degraded in vivo. Moreover, in vivo studies using animal models of acute myocardial infarction revealed that our hydrogel cardiac patch containing ANGPTL4 significantly improved heart tissue repair, evaluated by echocardiography and histological evaluation. The heart tissues treated with ANGPTL4-loaded hydrogel patches exhibited increased vascularization, reduced inflammatory macrophages, and structural maturation of cardiac cells.

{"title": "Suberosin Alleviates Thiazolidinedione-Induced Cardiomyopathy in Diabetic Rats by Inhibiting Ferroptosis via Modulation of ACSL4-LPCAT3 and PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathways.", "abstract": "Thiazolidinediones are useful antidiabetic medications. However, their use is associated with adverse side effects like edema, heart failure and bone fractures. In this study, we investigated the anti-ferroptosis effects of suberosin (SBR; a prenylated coumarin) in diabetic Sprague Dawley rats. Further, we assessed the effects of co-administration of SBR (30 and 90\u00a0mg/kg/day) with thiazolidinedione (TZ at 15\u00a0mg/kg) to mitigate TZ-induced cardiomyopathy in diabetic rats. Our results showed that cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricle systolic and diastolic pressures were aggravated in diabetic rats treated with TZ alone after 4\u00a0weeks. TZ treatments induced ferroptosis as well as marked histoarchitecture disarrangements in rat cardiomyocytes. The study found that optimizing volume overload alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and mitigated left ventricular dysfunction in diabetic rats co-treated with SBR.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease, utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a major functional receptor to enter host cells. No study has systematically assessed ACE2 expression in multiple tissues in children. This study investigated ACE2 expression and ACE2 protein's histological distribution in various organs in paediatric patients (the small intestine, thymus, heart and lungs). Our study revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in enterocytes of the small intestine and widely expressed in the myocardium of heart tissues. The most notable finding was the positive staining of ACE2 in the Hassall's corpuscles epithelial cells. Negligible ACE2 expression in the lung tissues may contribute to a lower risk of infection and fewer symptoms of pneumonia in children than in adults with COVID-19 infection.

Using a well-controlled in vitro transcript-based model system, we identify essential characteristics and parameter settings for AS in DRS, as the superior performance of depletion over enrichment. Here, the efficiency of depletion is close to the theoretical maximum. Additionally, we demonstrate that AS efficiently depletes specific transcripts in transcriptome-wide sequencing applications. Specifically, we applied our AS approach to poly(A)-enriched RNA samples from human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and mouse whole heart tissue and show efficient 2.5- to 2.8-fold depletion of highly abundant mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Finally, we characterize depletion and enrichment performance for complex transcriptome subsets, that is, at the level of the entire Chromosome 11, proving the general applicability of direct RNA AS.

It is highly expressed in the heart, but its roles have yet to be fully elucidated.\nPlin5-deficient mice and Plin5/leptin-double-knockout mice were produced, and their histological structures and myocardial functions were observed. Critical proteins related to fatty acid and glucose metabolism were measured in heart tissues, neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes and Plin5-overexpressing H9C2 cells. 2-NBDG was employed to detect glucose uptake. The mitochondria and lipid contents were observed by MitoTracker and BODIPY 493/503 staining in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes.\nPlin5 deficiency impaired glucose utilization and caused insulin resistance in mouse cardiomyocytes, particularly in the presence of fatty acids (FAs). Additionally, Plin5 deficiency increased the NADH content and elevated the expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) in cardiomyocytes, which resulted in increased lactate production. Moreover, when fatty acid oxidation was blocked by etomoxir or LDHA was inhibited by GSK2837808A in Plin5-deficient cardiomyocytes, glucose utilization was improved. Leptin-deficient mice exhibited myocardial hypertrophy, insulin resistance and altered substrate utilization, and Plin5 deficiency exacerbated myocardial hypertrophy in leptin-deficient mice.\nOur results demonstrated that Plin5 plays a critical role in coordinating fatty acid and glucose oxidation in cardiomyocytes, providing a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders in the heart.", "journal": "Biology direct", "date": "2023-09-05", "authors": ["LeleJian", "XingGao", "ChaoWang", "XiaoSun", "YuqiaoXu", "RuiliHan", "YuyingWang", "ShenhuiXu", "LanDing", "JingjunZhou", "YuGu", "YuanlinZhao", "YingYang", "YuanYuan", "JingYe", "LijunZhang"], "doi": "10.1186/s13062-023-00411-8\n10.1093/cvr/cvx017\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e74a14\n10.1177/107424840400900104\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302095\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.025\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000433\n10.1111/jcmm.15418\n10.1161/JAHA.119.012673\n10.1194/jlr.M029991\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.06.018\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.07.006\n10.1074/jbc.M111.328708\n10.1016/j.molmet.2014.06.002\n10.2337/db18-0670\n10.1002/hep.27409\n10.1007/s00424-020-02444-8\n10.1152/physrev.00063.2017\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108087\n10.1016/j.cmet.2020.12.003\n10.1074/jbc.M110.207779\n10.1038/ncomms12723\n10.1016/j.molcel.2019.12.003\n10.1016/j.jlr.2022.100172\n10.3390/cells8101241\n10.1128/MCB.00133-14\n10.1038/srep42574\n10.1194/jlr.M032466\n10.1194/jlr.M034710\n10.2337/db21-0535\n10.1038/s41467-022-32871-3\n10.1152/ajpendo.00093.2009\n10.1213/ANE.0000000000004838\n10.1016/j.bpj.2021.01.018\n10.1152/ajpheart.00449.2022\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.07.020\n10.1007/s11626-020-00503-z\n10.2337/db20-0719"}

However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF-1\u03b1-encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF-1\u03b1@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF-1\u03b1@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved \"soil\", the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size.

{"title": "Advances in nanobased platforms for cardiovascular diseases: Early diagnosis, imaging, treatment, and tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present a significant threat to health, with traditional therapeutics based treatment being hindered by inefficiencies, limited biological effects, and resistance to conventional drug. Addressing these challenges requires advanced approaches for early disease diagnosis and therapy. Nanotechnology and nanomedicine have emerged as promising avenues for personalized CVD diagnosis and treatment through theranostic agents. Nanoparticles serve as nanodevices or nanocarriers, efficiently transporting drugs to injury sites. These nanocarriers offer the potential for precise drug and gene delivery, overcoming issues like bioavailability and solubility. By attaching specific target molecules to nanoparticle surfaces, controlled drug release to targeted areas becomes feasible. In the field of cardiology, nanoplatforms have gained popularity due to their attributes, such as passive or active targeting of cardiac tissues, enhanced sensitivity and specificity, and easy penetration into heart and artery tissues due to their small size. However, concerns persist about the immunogenicity and cytotoxicity of nanomaterials, necessitating careful consideration. Nanoparticles also hold promise for CVD diagnosis and imaging, enabling straightforward diagnostic procedures and real-time tracking during therapy. Nanotechnology has revolutionized cardiovascular imaging, yielding multimodal and multifunctional vehicles that outperform traditional methods. The paper provides an overview of nanomaterial delivery routes, targeting techniques, and recent advances in treating, diagnosing, and engineering tissues for CVDs. It also discusses the future potential of nanomaterials in CVDs, including theranostics, aiming to enhance cardiovascular treatment in clinical practice. Ultimately, refining nanocarriers and delivery methods has the potential to enhance treatment effectiveness, minimize side effects, and improve patients' well-being and outcomes.", "journal": "Environmental research", "date": "2023-09-01", "authors": ["LalehShariati", "YasamanEsmaeili", "IlnazRahimmanesh", "ShahrzadBabolmorad", "GhazalZiaei", "AnwarulHasan", "MaryamBoshtam", "PooyanMakvandi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envres.2023.116933"}

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of naringin against the ischemia/reperfusion injury of aged rats.", "abstract": "Aging is known as a main risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Naringin (NRG) is a flavonoid compound derived from citrus fruits. It possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective. This investigation aimed to assess the cardioprotective effect of NRG against the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in aged rats. In this study, D-galactose (D-GAL) at the dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks was used to induce aging in rats. Rats were orally gavaged with NRG (40 or 100 mg/kg/day), in co-treatment with D-GAL, for 8 weeks. The Langendorff isolated heart was used to evaluate the effect of NRG on I/R injury in aged rats. NRG treatment diminished myocardial hypertrophy and maximum contracture level in aged animals. During the pre-ischemic phase, reduced heart rate was normalized by NRG. The effects of D-GAL on the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVDP), the rate pressure product (RPP), and the minimum and maximum rate of left ventricular pressure (\u00b1dp/dt) improved by NRG treatment in the perfusion period. NRG also enhanced post-ischemic recovery of cardiac functional parameters (\u00b1 dp/dt, and RPP) in isolated hearts. An increase in serum levels of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were reversed by NRG in aged rats. It also normalized the D-GAL-decreased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the heart tissue. NRG treatment alleviated cardiac injury in aged hearts under conditions of I/R.

{"title": "Etoricoxib nanostructured lipid carriers attenuate inflammation by modulating Cyclooxygenase-2 signaling and activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB-p65 pathways in radiation-induced acute cardiotoxicity in rats.", "abstract": "The current investigation aimed to explore the potential of etoricoxib nanostructured lipid carriers (ET-NLCs) as an anti-inflammatory drug in radiation-exposed rats, with a focus on assessing its efficacy in reducing inflammation while minimizing cardiac toxicity compared to conventional etoricoxib (ET) treatment. The ET-NLCs were prepared by the low-temperature melt emulsification solidification technique. Various techniques were employed to characterize the NLCs. Rats were exposed to gamma-irradiation (6\u00a0Gy) to induce cardiac inflammation and injury, followed by oral administration of ET or ET-NLCs (10\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) for 14 consecutive days. Results demonstrated a significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-\u03baB-p65), and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP-1) in the heart tissues of gamma-irradiated rats compared to the control group. This increase was accompanied by a reduction in the activity of antioxidant enzymes. However, treatment with ET and ET-NLCs exhibited a positive impact on these levels. Interestingly, the efficacy of ET-NLCs in mitigating radiation-induced inflammation in heart tissue was found to be superior to that of ET. In conclusion, the study suggests that the utilization of NLCs as a drug delivery system for ET may not only enhance its therapeutic efficacy but also help reduce the cardiovascular risks associated with ET, specifically focused on individuals who had been exposed to gamma radiation.

Transferrin receptor (TFRC), which promotes iron uptake through the transferrin cycle, is essential for cardiac function. However, whether TFRC is involved in the process of pathological cardiac hypertrophy is not clear.\nTransverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model and mice primary cardiomyocytes treated with isoproterenol (ISO) or phenylephrine (PHE) were used to mimic cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Single cell RNA sequence data from heart tissues of TAC-model mice was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and was analyzed with R package Seurat. TFRC expression and macrophage infiltration in the heart tissue were tested by immunofluorescent staining. Macrophage polarization was detected by Flow Cytometry. TFRC expressions were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and ELISA.\nTFRC expression is increased in the pathological cardiac hypertrophy of mice model and positively associated with macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, TFRC in cardiomyocytes recruits and activates macrophages by secreting C-C motif ligand 2 (Ccl2) in the mice heart tissue with TAC surgery or in the primary cardiomyocytes stimulated with ISO or PHE to induce myocardial hypertrophy in vitro. Moreover, we find that TFRC promotes Ccl2 expression in cardiomyocytes via regulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In addition, we find that increased TFRC expression in the HF tissue is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1).\nThis in-depth study shows that TFRC in cardiomyocytes promotes HF development through inducing macrophage infiltration and activation via the STAT3-Ccl2 signaling, and TFRC expression in cardiomyocytes is regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 during HF.

Adult Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups, including a normal control group and groups receiving DOX alone, DOX with TPM, DOX with SP, or DOX with a combination of TPM and SP. Cardiotoxicity was induced by administering DOX intraperitoneally at a cumulative dose of 16 mg/kg over 4\u00a0weeks. TPM and/or SP administration started 1\u00a0week before DOX treatment and continued for 35 days. Body weight, serum markers of cardiac damage, oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters were assessed. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed on cardiac tissues. Results showed that TPM and SP monotherapy led to significant improvements in serum levels of cardiac markers, decreased oxidative stress, reduced fibrosis-related growth factor levels, increased antioxidant levels, and improved histopathological features. SP demonstrated more prominent effects in comparison to TPM, and the combination of TPM and SP exhibited even more pronounced effects.

{"title": "Maternal androgen excess inhibits fetal cardiomyocytes proliferation through RB-mediated cell cycle arrest and induces cardiac hypertrophy in adulthood.", "abstract": "Maternal hyperandrogenism during pregnancy is associated with adverse gestational outcomes and chronic non-communicable diseases in offspring. However, few studies are reported to demonstrate the association between maternal androgen excess and cardiac health in offspring. This study aimed to explore the relation between androgen exposure in utero and cardiac health of offspring in fetal and adult period. Its underlying mechanism is also illustrated in this research.\nPregnant mice were injected with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from gestational day (GD) 16.5 to GD18.5. On GD18.5, fetal heart tissue was collected for metabolite and morphological analysis. The hearts from adult offspring were also collected for morphological and qPCR analysis. H9c2 cells were treated with 75\u00a0\u03bcM androsterone. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, qPCR, and western blot were performed to observe cell proliferation and explore the underlying mechanism.\nIntrauterine exposure to excessive androgen led to thinner ventricular wall, decreased number of cardiomyocytes in fetal offspring and caused cardiac hypertrophy, compromised cardiac function in adult offspring. The analysis of steroid hormone metabolites in fetal heart tissue by ultra performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry showed that the content of androgen metabolite androsterone was significantly increased. Mechanistically, H9c2 cells treated with androsterone led to a significant decrease in phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and cell cycle-related protein including cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and cyclin D1 (CCND1) in cardiomyocytes. This resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1-S phase, which in turn inhibited cardiomyocyte proliferation.\nTaken together, our results indicate that in utero exposure to DHT, its metabolite androsterone could directly decrease cardiomyocytes proliferation through cell cycle arrest, which has a life-long-lasting effect on cardiac health. Our study highlights the importance of monitoring sex hormones in women during pregnancy and the follow-up of cardiac function in offspring with high risk of intrauterine androgen exposure.", "journal": "Journal of endocrinological investigation", "date": "2023-08-29", "authors": ["YHuo", "WWang", "JZhang", "DXu", "FBai", "YGui"], "doi": "10.1007/s40618-023-02178-1\n10.1080/10408363.2017.1422109\n10.3390/ijms22126634\n10.3390/ijms222111668\n10.1530/JOE-20-0578\n10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.2673\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002888\n10.3390/ijms20123090\n10.1093/aje/kwx063\n10.1210/er.2015-1104\n10.1038/nrendo.2018.24\n10.1016/j.beem.2018.03.008\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.04.046\n10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.001\n10.1530/EJE-15-0699\n10.1093/humrep/17.10.2573\n10.1210/jc.2018-00889\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.02.005\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.09.042\n10.1093/humupd/dmv029\n10.1056/NEJMoa1000485\n10.1001/jama.2013.280386\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.012066\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.01.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.308428\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.05.022\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311349\n10.1007/s00018-016-2375-y\n10.1093/cvr/cvw074\n10.1074/jbc.M414482200\n10.1016/j.healun.2009.09.017\n10.1111/acel.13734\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04521\n10.1093/cvr/cvz180\n10.1186/1477-7827-9-110\n10.1152/ajpheart.00314.2018\n10.1152/physrev.00032.2006\n10.1007/s00018-016-2404-x\n10.1111/dgd.12134\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa159\n10.1016/j.ecl.2005.09.006\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.011\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043067\n10.1007/s00424-017-2061-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1016/j.devcel.2006.03.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2004.07.025\n10.1038/s41418-022-00988-z\n10.1016/j.phrs.2016.02.021\n10.1002/med.21558\n10.1016/j.canlet.2021.06.006\n10.1016/j.mce.2017.10.006"}

Cardiac tissue acetylcholine (ACh) and serum ACh, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were detected by ELISA to determine whether VNS was successful. An inflammatory injury model in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) was established by lipopolysaccharide and identified by evaluating TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels and tube formation. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to evaluate CD31-positive vessel density and stromal cell-derived factor-l alpha (SDF-1\u03b1) expression in the MI heart in vivo and the expression and distribution of SDF-1\u03b1, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 and CXCR7 in HCAECs in vitro. Western blotting was used to detect the levels of SDF-1\u03b1, V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and phosphorylation of Sp1 in HCAECs. Left ventricular performance, including left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and rate of the rise and fall of ventricular pressure, should be evaluated 28\u00a0days after VNS treatment. VNS was successfully established for MI therapy with decreases in serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels and increases in cardiac tissue and serum ACh levels, leading to increased SDF-1\u03b1 expression in coronary endothelial cells of MI hearts, triggering angiogenesis of MI hearts with increased CD31-positive vessel density, which was abolished by the m/nAChR inhibitors mecamylamine and atropine or knockdown of SDF-1\u03b1 by shRNA. ACh promoted SDF-1\u03b1 expression and its distribution along with the branch of the formed tube in HCAECs, resulting in an increase in the number of tubes formed in HCAECs. ACh increased the levels of pAKT and phosphorylation of Sp1 in HCAECs, resulting in inducing SDF-1\u03b1 expression, and the specific effects could be abolished by mecamylamine, atropine, the PI3K/AKT blocker wortmannin or the Sp1 blocker mithramycin. Functionally, VNS improved left ventricular performance, which could be abolished by Ad-shSDF-1\u03b1.\nVNS promoted angiogenesis to repair the infarcted heart by inducing SDF-1\u03b1 expression and redistribution along new branches during angiogenesis, which was associated with the m/nAChR-AKT-Sp1 signalling pathway.", "journal": "ESC heart failure", "date": "2023-08-29", "authors": ["YanWang", "YunLiu", "Xing-YuanLi", "Lu-YuanYao", "MagdaleenaNaemiMbadhi", "Shao-JuanChen", "Yan-XiaLv", "XinBao", "LongChen", "Shi-YouChen", "Jing-XuanZhang", "YanWu", "JingLv", "Liu-LiuShi", "Jun-MingTang"], "doi": "10.1002/ehf2.14475"}

{"title": "Nanobiotechnology-based strategies in alleviation of chemotherapy-mediated cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The cardiovascular diseases have been among the most common malignancies and the first leading cause of death, even higher than cancer. The cardiovascular diseases can be developed as a result of cardiac dysfunction and damages to heart tissue. Exposure to toxic agents and chemicals that induce cardiac dysfunction has been of interest in recent years. The chemotherapy drugs are commonly used for cancer therapy and in these patients, cardiovascular diseases have been widely observed that is due to negative impact of chemotherapy drugs on the heart. These drugs increase oxidative damage and inflammation, and mediate apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction. Hence, nanotechnological approaches have been emerged as new strategies in attenuation of chemotherapy-mediated cardiotoxicity. The first advantage of nanoparticles can be explored in targeted and selective delivery of drugs to reduce their accumulation in heart tissue. Nanostructures can deliver bioactive and therapeutic compounds in reducing cardiotoxicity and alleviation toxic impacts of chemotherapy drugs. The functionalization of nanostructures increases their selectivity against tumor cells and reduces accumulation of drugs in heart tissue. The bioplatforms such as chitosan and alginate nanostructures can also deliver chemotherapy drugs and reduce their cardiotoxicity. The function of nanostructures is versatile in reduction of cardiotoxicity by chemotherapy drugs and new kind of platforms is hydrogels that can mediate sustained release of drug to reduce its toxic impacts on heart tissue. The various kinds of nanoplatforms have been developed for alleviation of cardiotoxicity and their future clinical application depends on their biocompatibility. High concentration level of chitosan nanoparticles can stimulate cardiotoxicity. Therefore, if nanotechnology is going to be deployed for drug delivery and reducing cardiotoxicity, the first pre-requirement is to lack toxicity on normal cells and have high biocompatibility.", "journal": "Environmental research", "date": "2023-08-27", "authors": ["XuanmingLuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envres.2023.116989"}

There is a compelling need to understand the effects, safety thresholds, and mechanisms of radiation damage in human tissues, in order to develop measures for radiation protection during extended space travel. As animal models fail to recapitulate the molecular changes in astronauts, engineered human tissues and \"organs-on-chips\" are valuable tools for studying effects of radiation in vitro. We have developed a bioengineered tissue platform for studying radiation damage in individualized settings. To demonstrate its utility, we determined the effects of radiation using engineered models of two human tissues known to be radiosensitive: engineered cardiac tissues (eCT, a target of chronic radiation damage) and engineered bone marrow (eBM, a target of acute radiation damage). We report the effects of high-dose neutrons, a proxy for simulated galactic cosmic rays, on the expression of key genes implicated in tissue responses to ionizing radiation, phenotypic and functional changes in both tissues, and proof-of-principle application of radioprotective agents. We further determined the extent of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and matrix remodeling gene expression changes, and found that these changes were associated with an early hypertrophic phenotype in eCT and myeloid skewing in eBM.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Bioprinting in Cardiovascular Disease: Current Status and Future Directions.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing plays an important role in cardiovascular disease through the use of personalised models that replicate the normal anatomy and its pathology with high accuracy and reliability. While 3D printed heart and vascular models have been shown to improve medical education, preoperative planning and simulation of cardiac procedures, as well as to enhance communication with patients, 3D bioprinting represents a potential advancement of 3D printing technology by allowing the printing of cellular or biological components, functional tissues and organs that can be used in a variety of applications in cardiovascular disease. Recent advances in bioprinting technology have shown the ability to support vascularisation of large-scale constructs with enhanced biocompatibility and structural stability, thus creating opportunities to replace damaged tissues or organs.

{"title": "Application of biomedical materials in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a cardiovascular emergency and the leading cause of death worldwide. Inflammatory and immune responses are initiated immediately after MI, leading to myocardial death, scarring, and ventricular remodeling. Current therapeutic approaches emphasize early restoration of ischemic myocardial reperfusion, but there is no effective treatment for the pathological changes of infarction. Biomedical materials development has brought new hope for MI diagnosis and treatment. Biomedical materials, such as cardiac patches, hydrogels, nano biomaterials, and artificial blood vessels, have played an irreplaceable role in MI diagnosis and treatment. They improve the accuracy and efficacy of MI diagnosis and offer further possibilities for reducing inflammation, immunomodulation, inhibiting fibrosis, and cardiac regeneration. This review focuses on the advances in biomedical materials applications in MI diagnosis and treatment. The current studies are outlined in terms of mechanisms of action and effects. It is addressed how biomedical materials application can lessen myocardial damage, encourage angiogenesis, and enhance heart function. Their clinical transformation value and application prospect are discussed.", "journal": "Journal of nanobiotechnology", "date": "2023-08-26", "authors": ["JiahuiZhang", "YishanGuo", "YuBai", "YumiaoWei"], "doi": "10.1186/s12951-023-02063-2"}

Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the combined use of a\u00e7a\u00ed and the FAC-D chemotherapy protocol in a breast cancer model in vivo.\nMammary carcinogenesis was induced in thirty female Wistar rats by subcutaneous injection of 25\u00a0mg/kg 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) in the mammary gland. After sixty days, the rats were randomized into two groups: treated with 200\u00a0mg/kg of either a\u00e7a\u00ed extract or vehicle, via gastric tube for 45 consecutive days. The FAC-D protocol was initiated after 90 days of induction by intraperitoneal injection for 3 cycles with a 7-day break each. After treatment, blood was collected for haematological and biochemical analyses, and tumours were collected for macroscopic and histological analyses. In the same way, heart, liver, and kidney samples were also collected for macroscopic and histological analyses.\nBreast cancer was found as a cystic mass with a fibrotic pattern in the mammary gland. The histological analysis showed an invasive carcinoma area in both groups; however, in the saline group, there was a higher presence of inflammatory clusters. No difference was observed regarding body weight, glycaemia, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, and urea in either group. However, a\u00e7a\u00ed treatment decreased creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase MB (CKMB), troponin I and C-reactive protein levels and increased the number of neutrophils and monocytes. Heart histopathology showed normal myocardium in the a\u00e7a\u00ed treatment, while the saline group presented higher toxicity effects with loss of architecture of cardiac tissue. Furthermore, the a\u00e7a\u00ed treatment presented greater collagen distribution, increased hydroxyproline concentration and lower H2AX immunostaining in the heart samples.\nA\u00e7a\u00ed decreased the number of inflammatory cells in the tumor environment and exhibited protection against chemotherapy drug cardiotoxicity with an increased immune response in animals.

The combination of FTM HUCPVCs and ECFCs synergistically reduced fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, while promoting favorable cardiac remodeling and contractility. These effects were in part mediated by ANGPT2, PDGF-\u03b2, and VEGF-C. PDGF-\u03b2 signaling-dependent synergistic effects on angiogenesis were also observed in vitro and in vivo.

{"title": "Updates in Culture-Negative Endocarditis.", "abstract": "Blood culture-negative infective endocarditis (BCNE) is a challenging condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This review discusses the epidemiology, microbiology, diagnosis, and treatment of BCNE considering advancements in molecular diagnostics and increased access to cardiac surgery. BCNE can be categorized into bacterial endocarditis with sterilized blood cultures due to previous antibiotic treatment, endocarditis caused by fastidious microorganisms, and true BCNE caused by intracellular organisms that cannot be cultured using traditional techniques. Non-infectious causes such as nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis should also be considered.

And development of therapeutic molecules is obstructed by low efficiency and organ toxicity. Herein, we develop a long-term, low-toxic and liver-selected nano candidate, nabCK, to alleviate NAFLD. NabCK is simply composed by natural compound ginsenoside compound K (CK) and albumin. As a major metabolite of ginseng, ginsenoside CK has excellently modulating functions for lipid metabolism, but accompanied by an extremely poor bioavailability <1%. Albumin is a key lipid carrier secreted and metabolized by livers. Thereby, it can improve solubility and liver-localization of CK. In adipocytes and hepatocytes, nabCK prevents lipid deposition and eliminates lipid droplets. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that nabCK rectifies various pathways that involved in steatosis development, including lipid absorption, lipid export, fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid storage and inflammation. All these pathways are modulated by mTOR, the pivotal feedback sensor that is hyperactive in NAFLD. NabCK suppresses mTOR activation to restores lipid homeostasis. In high-fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD mice, nabCK retards development of steatosis and fibrosis, coupling a protective effect on cardiac tissues from lipotoxicity.

{"title": "Identification of hub genes associated with oxidative stress in heart failure and their correlation with immune infiltration using bioinformatics analysis.", "abstract": "Both oxidative stress and the immune response are associated with heart failure (HF). In this study, our aim was to identify the hub genes associated with oxidative stress andimmune infiltration of HF by bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification. The expression profile of GSE36074 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by GEO2R. The genes related to oxidative stress were extracted from GeneCards websites. Then, the functional enrichment analysis of oxidative stress-related DEGs (OSRDEGs) was performed using DAVID. In addition, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the STRING database and screened for hub genes with Cytoscape software. We also used CIBERSORTx to analyze immune infiltration in mice heart tissues between the TAC and Sham groups and explored the correlation between immune cells and hub genes. Finally, the hub genes were carried out using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot. A total of 136 OSRDEGs were found in GSE36074. Enrichment analysis revealed that these OSRDEGs were enriched in the mitochondrion, HIF-1, FoxO, MAPK and TNF signaling pathway. The five hub genes (Mapk14, Hif1a, Myc, Hsp90ab1, and Hsp90aa1) were screened by the cytoHubba plugin. The correlation analysis between immune cells and hub genes showed that Mapk14 was positively correlated with Th2 Cells, while Hif1a and Hsp90ab1exhibited a negative correlation with Th2 Cells; Myc exhibited a negative correlation with Monocytes; whereas, Hsp90aa1 was negatively correlated with NK Resting. Finally, five hub genes were validated by RT-qPCR, IHC and western blot. Mapk14, Hif1a, Myc, Hsp90ab1, and Hsp90aa1 are hub genes of HF and may play a critical role in the oxidative stress of HF. This study may provide new targets for the treatment of HF, and the potential immunotherapies are worthy of further study.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2023-08-23", "authors": ["JianjunGu", "Li NaZhang", "XiangGu", "YeZhu"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.15893\n10.1002/jcp.30574\n10.1172/JCI60329\n10.1038/srep40508\n10.18632/oncotarget.18264\n10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00154-5\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.03.010\n10.1016/0735-1097(96)00140-4\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000461\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033175\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.008788\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2016.07.003\n10.1111/febs.13250\n10.1038/s41423-022-00873-2\n10.1007/s10557-020-07071-0\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.735014\n10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81512-3\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.09.019\n10.1093/molehr/gaq043\n10.1016/j.cmet.2009.05.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007101\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007172\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.225\n10.1111/bph.13449\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.302317\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041694\n10.1038/sj.neo.7900232\n10.1536/ihj.13-343\n10.1111/j.1527-3466.2007.00018.x\n10.1016/j.ddmec.2010.07.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0170781\n10.1038/nrc904\n10.4049/jimmunol.178.12.7516\n10.1016/j.ahj.2011.05.007\n10.1002/ehf2.12005\n10.1096/fj.202101086R\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.116.003346\n10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_904_20\n10.1074/jbc.M117.784553\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309001\n10.1093/toxsci/kfq155\n10.1038/nature05602\n10.1007/s00424-009-0748-x\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00545.2010\n10.1152/ajpheart.00554.2011\n10.1073/pnas.92.12.5510\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.000281\n10.1002/ejhf.942\n10.3389/fphar.2021.796354"}
{"title": "Effects of Inflammatory Cell Death Caused by Catheter Ablation on Atrial Fibrillation.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) poses a serious healthcare burden on society due to its high morbidity and the resulting serious complications such as thrombosis and heart failure. The principle of catheter ablation is to achieve electrical isolation by linear destruction of cardiac tissue, which makes AF a curable disease. Currently, catheter ablation does not have a high long-term success rate. The current academic consensus is that inflammation and fibrosis are central mechanisms in the progression of AF. However, artificially caused inflammatory cell death by catheter ablation may have a significant impact on structural and electrical remodeling, which may affect the long-term prognosis. This review first focused on the inflammatory response induced by apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and their interaction with arrhythmia. Then, we compared the differences in cell death induced by radiofrequency ablation, cryoballoon ablation and pulsed-field ablation. Finally, we discussed the structural and electrical remodeling caused by inflammation and the association between inflammation and the recurrence of AF after catheter ablation. Collectively, pulsed-field ablation will be a revolutionary innovation with faster, safer, better tissue selectivity and less inflammatory response induced by apoptosis-dominated cell death.",

{"title": "Comprehensive Characterization of Endogenous Phospholamban Proteoforms Enabled by Photocleavable Surfactant and Top-down Proteomics.", "abstract": "Top-down mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful tool for analyzing intact proteins and their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs). In particular, membrane proteins play critical roles in cellular functions and represent the largest class of drug targets. However, the top-down MS characterization of endogenous membrane proteins remains challenging, mainly due to their intrinsic hydrophobicity and low abundance. Phospholamban (PLN) is a regulatory membrane protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is essential for regulating cardiac muscle contraction. PLN has diverse combinatorial PTMs, and their dynamic regulation has significant influence on cardiac contractility and disease. Herein, we have developed a rapid and robust top-down proteomics method enabled by a photocleavable anionic surfactant, Azo, for the extraction and comprehensive characterization of endogenous PLN from cardiac tissue. We employed a two-pronged top-down MS approach using an online reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem MS method on a quadrupole time-of-flight MS and a direct infusion method via an ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS. We have comprehensively characterized the sequence and combinatorial PTMs of endogenous human cardiac PLN. We have shown the site-specific localization of phosphorylation to Ser16 and Thr17 by MS/MS for the first time and the localization of S-palmitoylation to Cys36. Moreover, we applied our method to characterize PLN in disease and reported the significant reduction of PLN phosphorylation in human failing hearts with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Taken together, we have developed a streamlined top-down targeted proteomics method for comprehensive characterization of combinatorial PTMs in PLN toward better understanding the role of PLN in cardiac contractility.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2023-08-22", "authors": ["Holden TRogers", "David SRoberts", "Eli JLarson", "Jake AMelby", "Kalina JRossler", "Austin VCarr", "Kyle ABrown", "YingGe"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01618\n10.1021/ac303064a\n10.1038/nbt0303-262\n10.1038/nrd.2017.178\n10.1016/j.jprot.2010.01.005\n10.1093/database/baab012\n10.1038/nbt0303-255\n10.1002/prca.201400052\n10.1021/cr068286z\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02533\n10.1038/nrm1151\n10.3109/07853890008998837\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259754\n10.1161/01.RES.79.6.1059\n10.1016/S1050-1738(01)00145-1\n10.1073/pnas.1518368112\n10.1152/physrev.1998.78.4.921\n10.1038/342090a0\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.3.H769\n10.1038/ncomms7955\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.10.005\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.102180\n10.1002/mas.21348\n10.1038/nmeth.2369\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04747\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.02.041\n10.1146/annurev-anchem-071015-041550\n10.1038/nmeth1097\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.957829\n10.1002/pmic.201300432\n10.1021/jasms.1c00099\n10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03916\n10.1586/14789450.3.6.585\n10.1021/ac3031527\n10.1038/s41592-019-0391-1\n10.1002/anie.201915374\n10.1038/s41572-020-0151-7\n10.1136/heartjnl-2015-308037\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01738-7\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00729\n10.1021/pr900949p\n10.1021/pr500864a\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btad359\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00469\n10.1111/febs.12263\n10.1021/ac402850s\n10.1073/pnas.0402700101\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00034\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00952\n10.1021/jasms.1c00113\n10.1016/j.aca.2021.339400\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.12.002\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.10.005\n10.1002/0470029331.ch10"}
{"title": "Application of recombinant TGF-\u03b21 inhibitory peptide to alleviate isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a remodeling process of the cardiac interstitium, characterized by abnormal metabolism of the extracellular matrix, excessive accumulation of collagen fibers, and scar tissue hyperplasia. Persistent activation and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts of cardiac fibroblasts promote the progression of fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is a pivotal factor in cardiac fibrosis. Latency-associated peptide (LAP) is essential for activating TGF-\u03b21 and its binding to the receptor. Thus, interference with TGF-\u03b21 and the signaling pathways using LAP may attenuate cardiac fibrosis. Recombinant full-length and truncated LAP were previously constructed, expressed, and purified. Their effects on cardiac fibrosis were investigated in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and C57BL/6 mice. The study showed that LAP and tLAP inhibited ISO-induced CF activation, inflammation, and fibrosis, improved cardiac function, and alleviated myocardial injury in ISO-induced mice. LAP and tLAP alleviated the histopathological alterations and inhibited the elevated expression of inflammatory and fibrosis-related markers in cardiac tissue. In addition, LAP and tLAP decreased the ISO-induced elevated expression of TGF-\u03b2, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, p-Smad2, and p-Smad3.

However, cardiac tissue engineering porous and perfusable scaffolds to enable oxygen supply in vitro and eventually promote angiogenesis in vivo are still desirable. Two fully-aliphatic random copolymers of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene succinate/Pripol), P(BSBPripol), and poly(butylene/neopentyl glycol succinate), P(BSNS), containing two different subunits, neopentyl glycol and Pripol 1009, were successfully synthesized and then electrospun in tridimentional fibrous mats. The copolymers show different thermal and mechanical behaviours as result of their chemical structure. In particular, copolymerization led to a reduction in crystallinity and consequently PBS stiffness, reaching values of elastic modulus very close to those of soft tissues. Then, to check the biological suitability, human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) were directly seeded on both PBS-based copolymeric scaffolds. The results confirmed the ability of both the scaffolds to sustain cell viability and to maintain their stemness during cell expansion. Furthermore, gene expression and immunofluorescence analysis showed that P(BSBPripol) scaffold promoted an upregulation of the early cardiac progenitor and later-stage markers with a simultaneously upregulation of HYPPO pathway gene expression, crucial for mechanosensing of cardiac progenitor cells. These results suggest that the correct ad-hoc chemical design and, in turn, the mechanical properties of the matrix, such as substrate stiffness, together with surface porosity, play a critical role in regulating the behaviour of cardiac progenitors, which ultimately offers valuable insights into the development of novel bio-inspired scaffolds for cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2023-08-22", "authors": ["GiuliaGuidotti", "RobinDuelen", "NoraBloise", "MichelinaSoccio", "MassimoGazzano", "AnnalisaAluigi", "LiviaVisai", "MaurilioSampaolesi", "NadiaLotti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2023.213583"}

{"title": "WarpPINN: Cine-MR image registration with physics-informed neural networks.", "abstract": "The diagnosis of heart failure usually includes a global functional assessment, such as ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging. However, these metrics have low discriminate power to distinguish different cardiomyopathies, which may not affect the global function of the heart. Quantifying local deformations in the form of cardiac strain can provide helpful information, but it remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN, a physics-informed neural network to perform image registration to obtain local metrics of heart deformation. We apply this method to cine magnetic resonance images to estimate the motion during the cardiac cycle. We inform our neural network of the near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the Jacobian of the deformation field. The loss function has two components: an intensity-based similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. The architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. We use Fourier feature mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to capture discontinuities in the strain field. The algorithm is tested on synthetic examples and on a cine SSFP MRI benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers, where it is trained to learn the deformation mapping of each case. We outperform current methodologies in landmark tracking and provide physiological strain estimations in the radial and circumferential directions. WarpPINN provides precise measurements of local cardiac deformations that can be used for a better diagnosis of heart failure and can be used for general image registration tasks.

In the present study, we investigated the role of pioglitazone, dapagliflozin and their combination on RAS components in streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy in Wistar rats. Blood glucose, serum lipids, and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme), ACE2 levels were determined. mRNA levels of Myh6 (myosins heavy chain), Myh7, Ace, Ace2, Nppa, Nppb (natriuretic peptide A, B) and Ppars (peroxisome proliferator activating receptors) genes in the heart were determined by real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Protein expression of ACE and ACE2 was assessed by western blotting. After six weeks pioglitazone suppressed Ace mRNA and protein levels (p<0.05) and modified the Ace/Ace2 ratio (p<0.05) in the cardiac tissue of diabetic rats. Pioglitazone significantly decreased serum lipids (p<0.05) but did not significantly influence blood glucose and ACE serum levels of diabetic animals. Dapagliflozin had a significant glucose-lowering action (p<0.05) however, it had no impact on the Ace/Ace2 ratio.

Considering that there are numerous gaps in the literature on the metabolic processes that explain Obesity resistance, specifically in relation to oxidative stress, the purpose of the study was to investigate whether obesity-resistant (OR) rats develop elevated reactive oxygen species in cardiac tissue.\nWistar rats were initially randomized into two groups: a standard diet (SD) and a high-fat diet (HFD) group. The SD and HFD groups were further divided into control (C), OR, and obese prone (OP) subgroups based on body weight. This criterion consisted of organizing the animals in each group in ascending order according to body weight (BW), and the cutoff point was identified in the animals by terciles: 1) lower BW; 2) intermediate BW; and 3) higher BW.

We grouped rats into four experimental categories: sham surgery, sham treatment with eplerenone, nephrectomy without eplerenone (Nx), and nephrectomy with eplerenone (Nx\u2009+\u2009EP).

Cardiac tissue engineering has emerged as a promising solution, aiming to develop functional and physiologically relevant cardiac tissue constructs. Replicating the native heart microenvironment, with its complex and dynamic milieu necessary for cardiac tissue growth and function, is crucial in tissue engineering. Biomimetic strategies that closely mimic the natural heart microenvironment have gained significant interest due to their potential to enhance synthetic cardiac tissue functionality and therapeutic applicability. Biomimetic approaches focus on mimicking biochemical cues, mechanical stimuli, coordinated electrical signaling, and cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions of cardiac tissue. By combining bioactive ligands, controlled delivery systems, appropriate biomaterial characteristics, electrical signals, and strategies to enhance cell interactions, biomimetic approaches provide a more physiologically relevant environment for tissue growth. The replication of the native cardiac microenvironment enables precise regulation of cellular responses, tissue remodeling, and the development of functional cardiac tissue constructs.

However, the dynamic mechanical properties of cardiac tissues during MI progression remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigate the rheological responses of cardiac tissues at different stages of MI (i.e., early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage) with atomic force microscopy-based microrheology. Surprisingly, we discover that all cardiac tissues exhibit a universal two-stage power-law rheological behavior at different time scales. The experimentally found power-law exponents can capture an inconspicuous initial rheological change, making them particularly suitable as markers for early-stage MI diagnosis. We further develop a self-similar hierarchical model to characterize the progressive mechanical changes from subcellular to tissue scales. The theoretically calculated mechanical indexes are found to markedly vary among different stages of MI. These new mechanical markers are applicable for tracking the subtle changes of cardiac tissues during MI progression.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2023-08-15", "authors": ["ZhuoChang", "JingZhang", "YilunLiu", "HuajianGao", "Guang-KuiXu"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c01712\n10.1038/nnano.2008.410\n10.1038/s41586-020-2938-9\n10.1038/s41578-019-0169-1\n10.1038/s41568-020-00329-7\n10.1098/rstb.2018.0215\n10.1016/S1369-7021(11)70059-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.1152/ajpheart.01017.2005\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.12.028\n10.1152/ajpheart.00495.2009\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104342\n10.7150/thno.20616\n10.1038/s41598-021-00661-4\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.03.034\n10.1038/nnano.2016.52\n10.16965/ijar.2021.165\n10.1039/C4SM02718C\n10.1038/s41551-019-0380-9\n10.1038/s41467-021-23158-0\n10.1063/1.5039911\n10.1039/D1NR03894J\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-062910-100351\n10.1073/pnas.0702576104\n10.1038/nphys4104\n10.1038/s41598-020-61631-w\n10.1038/s41567-021-01368-z\n10.1016/j.devcel.2022.02.001\n10.1073/pnas.1702488114\n10.1038/s41586-022-05394-6\n10.1038/nmat3517\n10.1126/sciadv.abn6093\n10.1038/s41467-021-26283-y\n10.1038/ncomms10134\n10.1002/jcp.27597\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.207\n10.1038/s41569-021-00646-w\n10.1152/ajpheart.00108.2017\n10.1152/ajpheart.00679.2019\n10.1016/j.jprot.2016.11.017\n10.1038/s41569-022-00692-y\n10.1038/s44161-021-00007-3\n10.1016/j.matbio.2017.12.001"}
{"title": "Intra-host variation in the spike S1/S2 region of a feline coronavirus type-1 in a cat with persistent infection.", "abstract": "Feline coronavirus type 1 (FCoV-1) is widely known for causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a systemic infection that is often fatal, with the virus known as the FIPV biotype. However, subclinical disease also occurs, in which cats may not show signs and intermittently shed the virus, including in feces, possibly for long periods of time. This virus is known as the FECV biotype. Progression of FECV to FIPV has been linked to several genomic changes, however a specific region of the viral spike protein at the interface of the spike S1 and S2 domains has been especially implicated. In this study, we followed a cat (#576) for six years from 2017, at which time FCoV-1 was detected in feces and conjunctival swabs, until 2022, when the animal was euthanized based on a diagnosis of alimentary small cell lymphoma. Over this time period, the cat was clinically diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic rhinitis, and cardiac problems were also suspected. Using hybridization capture targeting the spike (S) gene of FCoV followed by next-generation sequencing, we screened 27 clinical samples. We detected FCoV-1 in 4 samples taken in 2017 (intestine and nasal tissue, feces, and conjunctiva), and 3 samples taken in 2022 (feces, and intestinal and heart tissue), but not in fecal samples taken in 2019 and 2020. Next, we focused on the S1/S2 region within S, which contains the furin cleavage site (FCS), a key regulator of viral transmission and pathogenesis. We show that the FCoV-1 variants obtained from feces in 2017 and 2022 were identical, while the ones from conjunctiva (2017), heart (2022), and intestine (2017 and 2022) were distinct. Sequence comparison of all the variants obtained showed that most of the non-synonymous changes in the S1/S2 region occur within the FCS. In the heart, we found two variants that differed by a single nucleotide, resulting in distinct FCS motifs that differ in one amino acid. It is predicted that one of these FCS motifs will down-regulate spike cleavability. The variant from the conjunctiva (2017) had a 6-nucleotide in-frame insertion that resulted in a longer and more exposed S1/S2 loop, which is predicted to be more accessible to the furin protease. Our studies indicate that FCoV-1 can independently persist in the gastrointestinal tract and heart of a cat over a long period of time without evidence of typical FIP signs, with intermittent viral shedding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2023-08-14", "authors": ["Ximena AOlarte-Castillo", "Beth NLicitra", "Nicole MAndr\u00e9", "Maria ASierra", "Christopher EMason", "Laura BGoodman", "Gary RWhittaker"], "doi": "10.1101/2023.07.31.551356"}
{"title": "", "abstract": "In many occupational settings, workers are frequently exposed to toluene and noise. However, the individual and combined effects of these exposures on the cardiovascular system have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of simultaneous exposure to toluene and noise on the rat heart, while also evaluating the potential preventive effect of olive leaf extract (OLE). Forty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to eight groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06/group): control group (C), control group that received OLE (C\u00a0+\u00a0OLE), group exposed to noise (N), group exposed to noise and receiving OLE (N\u00a0+\u00a0OLE), group exposed to toluene (T), group exposed to toluene and receiving OLE (T\u00a0+\u00a0OLE), group co-exposed to noise and toluene (NT), and group co-exposed to noise and toluene and receiving OLE (NT\u00a0+\u00a0OLE). The rats in this study were subjected to simultaneous exposure to toluene and noise for a duration of six weeks, within a custom-built plexiglass chamber. Toluene was administered at a concentration of 300\u00a0ppm, while the noise level was set to 85\u00a0dB(A). The exposure chamber was equipped with a generation system, an exposure system, and a monitoring system, ensuring precise and accurate exposure conditions. After the six-week period, heart and blood samples were collected from the rats for subsequent analysis. Plasma levels of cholesterol (CHOL), triglycerides (TG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) were measured, and histopathological investigation was conducted using HE staining. Additionally, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in heart tissue were measured. Our results showed that simultaneous exposure to noise and toluene altered CHOL, TG, LDH, and CK levels, and also caused an increase in lipid peroxidation levels and superoxide dismutase activity, along with a decrease in catalase activity in the heart. A significant alteration in the myocardium was also observed. However, treatment with OLE was found to modulate these oxidative and histological changes, ultimately correcting the deleterious effects induced by the combined exposure to noise and toluene.

Pharmacotherapy is based on the administration of a few drugs, which exhibit hazardous adverse effects and toxicity to the patients. Thus, the search for new antitrypanosomatid drugs is imperative to overcome the limitations of the treatments. In this work, 46 2-nitroimidazole 3,5-disubstituted isoxazole compounds were synthesized in good yields by [3\u00a0+\u00a02] cycloaddition reaction between terminal acetylene (propargyl-2-nitroimidazole) and chloro-oximes.

Hyperglycemic conditions or hyperosmolar controls were applied for one day to model acute hyperglycemia and for seven days to model chronic hyperglycemia. 120\u00a0min' simulated ischemia (SI) was followed by 120\u00a0min' reperfusion (R) and 1-day follow-up reperfusion (FR).

{"title": "Natriuretic Peptide Signaling in Uterine Biology and Preeclampsia.", "abstract": "Endometrial decidualization is a uterine process essential for spiral artery remodeling, embryo implantation, and trophoblast invasion. Defects in endometrial decidualization and spiral artery remodeling are important contributing factors in preeclampsia, a major disorder in pregnancy. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone that regulates blood volume and pressure. ANP is also generated in non-cardiac tissues, such as the uterus and placenta. In recent human genome-wide association studies, multiple loci with genes involved in natriuretic peptide signaling are associated with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In cellular experiments and mouse models, uterine ANP has been shown to stimulate endometrial decidualization, increase TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand expression and secretion, and enhance apoptosis in arterial smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. In placental trophoblasts, ANP stimulates adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling, leading to autophagy inhibition and protein kinase N3 upregulation, thereby increasing trophoblast invasiveness.

{"title": "3D printing of thick myocardial tissue constructs with anisotropic myofibers and perfusable vascular channels.", "abstract": "Engineering of myocardial tissues has become a promising therapeutic strategy for treating myocardial infarction (MI). However, a significant challenge remains in generating clinically relevant myocardial tissues that possess native microstructural characteristics and fulfill the requirements for implantation within the human body. In this study, a thick 3D myocardial construct with anisotropic myofibers and perfusable branched vascular channels is created with clinically relevant dimensions using a customized beam-scanning stereolithography printing technique. To obtain tissue-specific matrix niches, a decellularized extracellular matrix microfiber-reinforced gelatin-based bioink is developed. The bioink plays a crucial role in facilitating the precise manufacturing of a hierarchical microstructure, enabling us to better replicate the physiological characteristics of the native myocardial tissue matrix in terms of structure, biomechanics, and bioactivity. Through the integration of the tailored bioink with our printing method, we demonstrate a biomimetic architecture, appropriate biomechanical properties, vascularization, and improved functionality of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in the thick tissue construct in vitro. This work not only offers a novel and effective means to generate biomimetic heart tissue in vitro for the treatment of MI, but also introduces a potential methodology for creating clinically relevant tissue products to aid in other complex tissue/organ regeneration and disease model applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2023-08-11", "authors": ["HaitaoCui", "Zu-XiYu", "YiminHuang", "Sung YunHann", "TimothyEsworthy", "Yin-LinShen", "Lijie GraceZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2023.213579"}

By providing personalized solutions and pushing the limits of regenerative medicine, 3D printing technology has revolutionized the field of cardiac healthcare. The use of several organic and synthetic polymers in 3D printing heart valves is explored in this article, with emphasis on both their benefits and drawbacks. In cardiac tissue engineering, stem cells are essential, and their potential to lessen immunological rejection and thrombogenic consequences is highlighted. In the clinical applications section, the article emphasizes the importance of 3D printing in preoperative planning. Surgery results are enhanced when surgeons can visualize and assess the size and placement of implants using patient-specific anatomical models. Customized implants that are designed to match the anatomy of a particular patient reduce the likelihood of complications and enhance postoperative results. The development of physiologically active cardiac implants, made possible by 3D bioprinting, shows promise by eliminating the need for artificial valves.

{"title": "Sarcomeric network analysis of ex vivo cultivated human atrial appendage tissue using super-resolution microscopy.", "abstract": "Investigating native human cardiac tissue with preserved 3D macro- and microarchitecture is fundamental for clinical and basic research. Unfortunately, the low accessibility of the human myocardium continues to limit scientific progress. To overcome this issue, utilizing atrial appendages of the human heart may become highly beneficial. Atrial appendages are often removed during open-heart surgery and can be preserved ex vivo as living tissue with varying durability depending on the culture method. In this study, we prepared living thin myocardial slices from left atrial appendages that were cultured using an air-liquid interface system for overall 10 days. Metabolic activity of the cultured slices was assessed using a conventional methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. To monitor the structural integrity of cardiomyocytes within the tissue, we implemented our recently described super-resolution microscopy approach that allows both qualitative and quantitative in-depth evaluation of sarcomere network based on parameters such as overall sarcomere content, filament size and orientation. Additionally, expression of mRNAs coding for key structural and functional proteins was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our findings demonstrate highly significant disassembly of contractile apparatus represented by degradation of [Formula: see text]-actinin filaments detected after three days in culture, while metabolic activity was constantly rising and remained high for up to seven days. However, gene expression of crucial cardiac markers strongly decreased after the first day in culture indicating an early destructive response to ex vivo conditions. Therefore, we suggest static cultivation of living myocardial slices derived from left atrial appendage and prepared according to our protocol only for short-termed experiments (e.g. medicinal drug testing), while introduction of electro-mechanical stimulation protocols may offer the possibility for long-term integrity of such constructs.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2023-08-11", "authors": ["OleksandraChabanovska", "HeikoLemcke", "HermannLang", "BrigitteVollmar", "Pascal MDohmen", "RobertDavid", "ChristianEtz", "CatharinaNe\u00dfelmann"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-39962-1\n10.1016/j.jacep.2016.06.006\n10.1155/2016/6492183\n10.1016/s0002-9149(97)00903-x\n10.1053/euje.2000.0019\n10.1038/s41569-020-0381-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0059228\n10.1177/1076029608323088\n10.1056/NEJMoa2101897\n10.1007/s11886-018-1033-4\n10.1016/j.taap.2020.115213\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.06.001\n10.1007/s00395-020-00822-y\n10.1093/cvr/cvx152\n10.1002/ehf2.13832\n10.1093/cvr/cvx215\n10.1038/s41556-022-00899-8\n10.1038/s41591-019-0738-2\n10.1038/s41392-022-01044-5\n10.1007/s00018-022-04196-3\n10.1046/j.1365-2818.2000.00710.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvr259\n10.3389/fphys.2022.839139\n10.1038/s41467-018-08003-1\n10.1038/srep28798\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.03.005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0282859\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)77288-3\n10.1093/jnci/24.3.573\n10.3109/15376519209087715\n10.1159/000087739\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.928903\n10.1093/toxsci/kfz168\n10.1093/toxsci/kfaa058\n10.1016/j.vascn.2020.106892\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103813\n10.1186/s13287-022-03021-9\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.12.007\n10.1111/jce.15157\n10.1016/j.cma.2020.113468\n10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004133\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.748053\n10.1152/ajpcell.00056.2016\n10.1016/j.hroo.2020.05.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.02.555\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv625\n10.3390/cells10112852\n10.1038/s41418-017-0012-4\n10.1016/j.molmed.2013.01.005\n10.1007/s10974-021-09596-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0129176\n10.1017/s0031182006000011\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.07.055\n10.1007/s00414-017-1643-1\n10.1007/s00414-023-03024-y\n10.1109/34.659930\n10.1007/978-3-319-28549-8_3\n10.1007/s10237-011-0325-z\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.528091"}
{"title": "Cardiac sequelae in athletes following COVID-19 vaccination: evidence and misinformation.", "abstract": "The recognition of myocarditis as a rare side effect of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination has sparked a global debate on vaccine safety, especially in the realm of sports. The main proposed mechanisms in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination-associated myocarditis (C-VAM) are based on the activation of the innate- and adaptive immune system against a susceptible immune-genetic background, including the recognition of mRNA as an antigen by the immune system, molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and cardiac tissue antigens and inflammatory sex-hormone signalling. The relatively younger age of the athlete population hypothetically constellates an increased risk of C-VAM. A subgroup analysis in individuals under 40 years revealed a low incidence of myocarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination when compared to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. No confirmed cases of athletes experiencing cardiac complications after mRNA vaccination have been reported. Most athletes only reported mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. A small but statistically significant decrease in maximal oxygen consumption in recreational athletes occurred after BNT162b2 mRNA booster vaccine administration. The clinical relevance and temporality of which remain to be determined. Many speculative social media reports attribute sudden cardiac arrest/death (SCA/D) in athletes to mRNA vaccination. Large media outlets have thoroughly debunked these claims. There is currently no evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination increases the risk of myocardial sequelae or SCA/D in athletes. However, specific vaccine regimen selection and timing may be appropriate to prevent detrimental performance effects.", "journal": "British journal of sports medicine", "date": "2023-08-11", "authors": ["Joelle Julius NicolaasDaems", "Juliette Cvan Hattum", "Sjoerd MVerwijs", "Nick RBijsterveld", "MaartenGroenink", "Arthur A MWilde", "Yigal MPinto", "Harald TJorstad"], "doi": "10.1136/bjsports-2023-106847"}

Recent research has indicated that sodium butyrate (NaB) affects glucose metabolism and exercise has an anti-hyperglycemic effect in diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of NaB and treadmill exercise on heart angiogenesis through the miR-34a/SIRT1/FOXO1-HIF-1\u03b1 pathway. Diabetic animals received NaB (400\u2009mg/kg daily, orally) and treadmill exercise for 6\u2009weeks. The effect of NaB and treadmill exercise, alone or combined, on miR-34a expression, SIRT1, FOXO1, HIF-1\u03b1 levels, and angiogenesis in diabetic heart tissue was measured. Diabetes caused increased miR-34a (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and FOXO1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) expression levels. Also, SIRT1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and HIF-1\u03b1 (not significant) expression levels were reduced in diabetic rats. NaB and treadmill exercise decreased miR-34a (respectively p\u2009<\u20090.05 and not significant) and FOXO1 (both p\u2009<\u20090.001) expression levels and improved SIRT1 (both not significant) and HIF-1\u03b1 (respectively p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.001) levels. Also, NaB combined with treadmill exercise decreased miR-34a (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and FOXO1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) expression levels, and elevated SIRT1 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and HIF-1\u03b1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) levels in comparison with the diabetic group. NaB and treadmill exercises modulate the expression of miR-34a and the levels of SIRT1, FOXO1, and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins, thus increasing angiogenesis in the heart tissue of diabetic rats.

{"title": "Peptidyl arginine deiminase inhibition alleviates angiotensin II-induced fibrosis.", "abstract": "The conversion of protein arginine residues to citrulline by calcium-dependent peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, indicating that PADs are therapeutic targets. A recent study indicated that PAD4 regulates age-related organ fibrosis and dysfunction; however, the specific role of this PAD and its citrullination substrate remains unclear. We investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of PAD activity could affect the progression of fibrosis and restore heart function.\nCardiac hypertrophy was induced by chronic infusion of angiotensin (Ang) II. After 2 weeks of AngII infusion, a PAD inhibitor (Cl-amidine hydrochloride) or vehicle (saline) was injected every other day for the next 14 days together with the continued administration of AngII for a total of up to 28 days. Cardiac fibrosis and remodeling were evaluated by quantitative heart tissue histology, echocardiography, and mass spectrometry.\nA reverse AngII-induced effect was observed in PAD inhibitor-treated mice (n=6) compared with AngII vehicle-treated mice, as indicated by a significant reduction in the heart/body ratio (AngII: 6.51\u00b10.8 mg/g vs. Cl-amidine: 5.27\u00b10.6 mg/g), a reduction in fibrosis (AngII: 2.1-fold increased vs. Cl-amidine: 1.8-fold increased), and a reduction in left ventricular posterior wall diastole (LWVPd) (AngII: 1.1\u00b10.04 vs. Cl-amidine: 0.78\u00b10.02 mm). Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of heart tissue indicated that proteins involved in fibrosis (e.g., periostin), cytoskeleton organization (e.g., transgelin), and remodeling (e.g., myosin light chain, carbonic anhydrase) were normalized by Cl-amidine treatment.\nOur findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of PAD may be an effective strategy to attenuate cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2023-08-10", "authors": ["TakeshiIjichi", "NivedaSundararaman", "Thomas GMartin", "RakhiPandey", "EtaiKoronyo", "Jonathan AKirk", "EduardoMarb\u00e1n", "Jennifer EVan Eyk", "JustynaFert-Bober"], "doi": null}

A deformable poromechanical model of cardiac tissue was developed that coupled joule heating from the electrode, heat transfer, and blood flow from normal perfusion and thermally driven natural convection, which mimics the real tissue structure more closely and provides more realistic results compared to previous models. The expansion of tissue from temperature rise reduces blood velocity, leading to increased tissue temperature, thus affecting steam pop occurrence. Detailed temperature velocity, and thermal expansion of the tissue provided a comprehensive picture of the process. Poromechanical expansion of the tissue from temperature rise reduces blood velocity, increasing tissue temperature. Tissue properties influence temperatures, with lower porosity increasing the temperatures slightly, due to lower velocities. Deeper electrode insertion raises temperature due to increased current flow. The results demonstrate that a 5% increase in porosity leads to a considerable 10% increase in maximum tissue temperature.

Ovarian hormone deprivation was performed through bilateral ovariectomy. HCTZ (30mg/kg/day) and concurrent exercise training (3d/wk) were conducted lasted 8 weeks. Arterial pressure (AP) was directly recorded. Cardiac effort was evaluated using the rate-pressure product (RPP = systolic AP x heart rate).

Here, we studied the role of adrenergic-mediated stress using a simple model of reversible stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and show that isoproterenol-induced tissue injury and inflammation are sufficient to protect the heart from the myopathic effects of a subsequent exposure to isoproterenol.

Schisantherin A (SCA), a dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan monomer found in S. chinensis fruits has cardiovascular advantages such as increasing NO production in isolated rat thoracic aorta and reducing heart damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) through decreasing apoptosis. The present study was undertaken to explore the potential effects of SCA on ISO-induced myocardial infarction in rats.\nRats were randomly allocated to four groups: control; ISO-treated, and two additional groups of ISO\u2009+\u2009SCA (5 or 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight). All SCA-treated groups were administered with SCA for 20 days and all ISO groups were challenged with ISO on days 19 and 20.\nSCA significantly attenuated ISO-induced rise in heart/body weight ratio, myocardial infarct size, and cardiac functional biomarkers (CK-MB, cTnI and BNP). SCA pre- and co-treatment resulted in a significant reduction in oxidative stress (via MDA, NO and GSH and increased activities of SOD, CAT and GPx) and inflammation (via decreased levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) markers when compared to the same levels in cardiac tissue of ISO-treated rats. This study also showed that SCA protects ISO-induced oxidative stress and inflammation by activating the PI3K-AKT/Nrf2/ARE pathway and suppressing TLR4/MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathways. Furthermore, SCA treatment protected histopathological alterations observed in only ISO-treated cardiac transverse sections of rats.\nIn conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that SCA protects against cardiac injury in the ISO-induced MI model of rats.", "journal": "BMC complementary medicine and therapies", "date": "2023-08-05", "authors": ["XiaolongMi", "ZhijunZhang", "JinfangCheng", "ZhengXu", "KaiyiZhu", "YunxiaRen"], "doi": "10.1186/s12906-023-04081-x"}
{"title": "Resveratrol prevents Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling.", "abstract": "Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a hallmark of various cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including chronic heart failure (HF) and an important target for the treatment of these diseases. Aberrant activation of Angiotensin II (Ang II)/AT1R signaling pathway is one of the main triggers of cardiac hypertrophy, which further gives rise to excessive inflammation that is mediated by the key transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Resveratrol (REV) is a natural polyphenol with multiple anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, however the ability of REV in preventing Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in combination with NF-\u03baB signaling activation remains unclear.\nMurine models of cardiac hypertrophy was conducted via implantation of Ang II osmotic pumps. Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocyte and heart tissues were examined to determine the effect and underlying mechanism of REV in preventing Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.\nAdministrations of REV significantly prevented Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, as well as robustly attenuated Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, REV not only directly prevented Ang II/AT1R signal transductions, but also prevented Ang II-induced expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\nOur study provides important new mechanistic insight into the cardioprotective effects of REV in preventing Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy via inhibiting adverse NF-\u03baB signaling activation.

{"title": "Mitochondrial biogenesis and apoptosis as underlying mechanisms involved in the cardioprotective effects of Gallic acid against D-galactose-induced aging.", "abstract": "Aging is a main risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Gallic acid (GA) is a phenolic compound derived from a wide range of fruits. GA has a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective effects. This research was conducted to determine the cardioprotective effect of GA on cardiac hypertrophy in aged rats.\nFollowing histological evaluation and through observing the heart, we found that GA improved the cardiac hypertrophy induced by D-galactose (D-GAL) in cardiac cells. To clarify the causes for this anti-aging effect, we evaluated the malonic dialdehyde levels and antioxidant enzyme activity in rat cardiac tissue. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK-MB) in serum were measured. The levels of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and apoptosis in cardiac tissue were surveyed. The findings represented that GA ameliorated antioxidant enzyme activity while significantly decreasing the malonic dialdehyde levels. Real-time PCR analysis proposed that GA effectively improved mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart via regulating the expression levels of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC1-\u03b1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). GA also mitigated apoptosis in the heart by modulating the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax). In addition, GA improved serum LDH and CK-MB levels.\nGA may alleviate aging-induced cardiac hypertrophy via anti-oxidative, mitoprotective, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.", "journal": "Molecular biology reports", "date": "2023-08-04", "authors": ["MohammadZarei", "AbdolrahmanSarihi", "AlirezaZamani", "SafouraRaoufi", "Seyed AsaadKarimi", "FatemehRamezani-Aliakbari"], "doi": "10.1007/s11033-023-08670-4\n10.3389/fmed.2018.00061\n10.1042/CS20171156\n10.1016/j.cmet.2022.08.017\n10.1007/s11427-019-9591-5\n10.18632/aging.102647\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166402\n10.3389/fphys.2022.1040381\n10.1186/s12974-021-02250-8\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102884\n10.1111/bph.15068\n10.1111/os.13302\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.02.027\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050812\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154105\n10.2174/1871520621666211119085834\n10.1007/s10753-022-01676-3\n10.3390/ijms141020443\n10.3390/ph14111071\n10.1177/09603271211064532\n10.1007/s40520-018-1075-x\n10.1016/j.exger.2018.06.012\n10.1007/s00210-022-02227-1\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.10.035\n10.1007/s00253-022-12041-7\n10.3390/cells11030552\n10.1016/j.neulet.2021.135963\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.113297\n10.1016/j.neuint.2017.02.007\n10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109328\n10.1038/s41598-018-33438-3\n10.1007/s00424-022-02702-x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.089\n10.3390/nu14214469\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165417\n10.1007/s12272-019-01188-z\n10.1021/jacs.0c10836\n10.1111/jcmm.15725\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.055"}

Here, we leveraged both mouse models and human primary cardiac cells to define the mechanisms of CHIKV heart infection. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of CHIKV infection as well as human primary cardiac cells, we demonstrate that CHIKV directly infects and actively replicates in cardiac fibroblasts. In immunocompetent mice, CHIKV is cleared from cardiac tissue without significant damage through the induction of a local type I interferon response from both infected and non-infected cardiac cells. Using mice deficient in major innate immunity signaling components, we found that signaling through the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is required for viral clearance from the heart. In the absence of MAVS signaling, persistent infection leads to focal myocarditis and vasculitis of the large vessels attached to the base of the heart. Large vessel vasculitis was observed for up to 60 days post infection, suggesting CHIKV can lead to vascular inflammation and potential long-lasting cardiovascular complications.

Detecting the xenobiotic and its biotransformation products as part of the metabolomics analysis provides an opportunity to simultaneously gain deep insights into its fate and metabolism, and to associate the internal relative dose directly with endogenous metabolic responses. This integration of untargeted exposure and response measurements into a single assay has yet to be fully demonstrated. Here we assemble a workflow to discover and analyse pharmaceutical-related measurements from routine untargeted UHPLC-MS metabolomics datasets, derived from in vivo (rat plasma and cardiac tissue, and human plasma) and in vitro (human cardiomyocytes) studies that were principally designed to investigate endogenous metabolic responses to drug exposure.

{"title": "Homotypic targeted nanoplatform enable efficient chemoimmunotherapy and reduced DOX cardiotoxicity in chemoresistant cancer via TGF-\u03b21 blockade.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) with broad-spectrum antitumor activity has been reported to induce effective immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect. However, the serious cardiotoxicity and chemoresistance severely restrict the widely clinical application of DOX. Herein, for the first time, a bio-inspired nanoplatform via co-assembly of DOX-conjugated polyethyleneimine (PEI-DOX), cancer cell membrane (CCM) and TGF-\u03b21 siRNA (siTGF-\u03b21) was rationally designed, which can not only overcome the drawbacks of DOX but also display high capability to modulate the tumor microenvironment and prevent the tumor progressing and metastasis. Experimental studies confirmed the pH-sensitivity of PEI-DOX and the homotypic-targeting and immuno-escapable ability of CCM, resulting an enhanced accumulation of DOX and siTGF-\u03b21 in tumor sites. In addition to this, the bio-inspired nanoplatform could also improve the stability and facilitate the endosomal escape of siTGF-\u03b21. All these effects ensured the silence efficiency of siTGF-\u03b21 in tumor sites, which could further modulate the chemoresistant and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, resulting a synergistic effect with DOX to prevent tumor progressing and metastasis. Additionally, even trapped in cardiac tissues, siTGF-\u03b21 could inhibit the production of TGF-\u03b21 and ROS induced by DOX, resulting a reduced myocardial damage. Therefore, our newly designed bio-inspired nano-delivery system may be a promising nanoplatform with efficient chemoimmunotherapy to ameliorate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and combat tumor growth and metastasis in chemoresistant cancer.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2023-08-04", "authors": ["NuannuanLi", "TianyuZhang", "RuWang", "YiyingSun", "LiuxiangChu", "XiaoyanLu", "KaoxiangSun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2023.07.063"}

Compared with single modification, the double modification strategy facilitated the efficiency of pyrrole polymerization, so that the patch conductivity is improved. According to the results of experiments in vivo and in vitro, the scaffold can promote the maturation and functionalization of cardiomyocytes (CMs). It can also reduce the inflammatory response, increase local microcirculation, and reconstruct the conductive microenvironment in infarcted myocardia, thus improving the cardiac function of MI rats.

A hypoxic plateau rat model was established using an animal decompression chamber. A blood routine test was performed by an animal blood cell analyzer on rats cultured for different hypoxia periods at 4,500 m above sea level. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot were used to detect the changes of protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit (PP4C) gene and protein in heart, lung, and brain tissues. The PP4C gene with the highest expression level found in rats slowly entering the high altitude area (20 m-2200 m-7 d-4500 m-3 d) was about twice as high as the low elevation group (20 m above sea level). The simulated high-altitude hypoxia induced an increase of PP4C expression level in all tissues, and the expression in the lung tissue was twice as expressed as heart and brain tissue at high altitude (P < 0.05).

{"title": "Mitigation of Fibrosis after Myocardial Infarction in Rats by Using a Porcine Cholecyst Extracellular Matrix.", "abstract": "Fibrosis that occurs after nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) is an irreversible reparative cardiac tissue remodeling process characterized by progressive deposition of highly cross-linked type I collagen. No currently available therapeutic strategy prevents or reverses MI-associated fibrotic scarring of myocardium. In this study, we used an epicardial graft prepared of porcine cholecystic extracellular matrix to treat experimental nonfatal MI in rats. Graft-assisted healing was characterized by reduced fibrosis, with scanty deposition of type I collagen. Histologically, the tissue response was associated with a favorable regenerative reaction predominated by CD4-positive helper T lymphocytes, enhanced angiogenesis, and infiltration of proliferating cells. These observations indicate that porcine cholecystic extracellular matrix delayed the fibrotic reaction and support its use as a potential biomaterial for mitigating fibrosis after MI. Delaying the progression of cardiac tissue remodeling may widen the therapeutic window for management of scarring after MI.", "journal": "Comparative medicine", "date": "2023-08-02", "authors": ["Reshma SNair", "Praveen KSobhan", "Sachin JShenoy", "Mukund APrabhu", "VikasKumar", "SuryaRamachandran", "Thapasimuthu VAnilkumar"], "doi": "10.30802/AALAS-CM-22-000097\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.02.003\n10.1056/NEJMra1606915\n10.1002/jbm.b.33131\n10.5935/abc.20160005\n10.1177/0192623317752894\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.9\n10.1021/bm061088x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000438\n10.1016/J.ENG.2016.01.028\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313261\n10.1038/s41598-019-49575-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243162\n10.1172/JCI87491\n10.1134/S1990747819030140\n10.1038/s41569-018-0036-6\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.08.006\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.05.011\n10.1038/ncomms15509\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.005\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9683\n10.1111/bph.14155\n10.1038/s41536-018-0044-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183323\n10.1007/s11259-018-9731-3\n10.1093/rb/rbz017\n10.1038/s41598-019-49666-0\n10.1038/s41551-018-0229-7\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.10.001\n10.1073/pnas.1605431113\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.05.005\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.08.005\n10.1016/j.healun.2016.01.012\n10.1002/jbm.b.34457\n10.1021/acsabm.0c01648\n10.1002/jbm.b.33567\n10.1002/jbm.b.33296\n10.1177/0192623314550722\n10.3892/br.2015.500\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.05.056\n10.1002/jbm.b.35058\n10.1038/s41467-019-11091-2\n10.3389/fcell.2019.00063\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.025\n10.1021/acsabm.0c01627\n10.5935/abc.20160097\n10.4330/wjc.v7.i5.243\n10.1177/0885328215615759\n10.1177/2041731413518060\n10.1172/JCI123859\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.525436\n10.1038/s41598-019-53351-7\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.017\n10.1016/j.cjca.2014.08.014\n10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9\n10.1038/s41551-017-0182-x\n10.1007/s40778-017-0075-7\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aay2140\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.01.097\n10.1038/am.2017.171\n10.1038/s41419-018-0573-2\n10.1016/S1071-9164(99)90034-9"}
{"title": "Mechanism of COVID-19-Induced Cardiac Damage from Patient, In Vitro and Animal Studies.", "abstract": "Though patient studies have been important for understanding the disease, research done in animals and cell culture complement our knowledge from patient data and provide insight into the mechanism of the disease. Understanding how COVID causes damage to the heart is essential to understanding possible long-term consequences.\nCOVID-19 is primarily a disease that attacks the lungs; however, it is known to have important consequences in many other tissues including the heart. Though myocarditis does occur in some patients, for most cases of cardiac damage, the injury arises from scarring either due to myocardial infarction or micro-infarction. The main focus is on how COVID affects blood flow through the coronaries. We review how endothelial activation leads to a hypercoagulative state in COVID-19. We also emphasize the effects that the cytokine storm can directly have on the regulation of coronary blood flow. Since the main two cell types that can be infected in the heart are pericytes and cardiomyocytes, we further describe the known effects on pericyte function and how that can further lead to microinfarcts within the heart. Though many of these effects are systemic, this review focuses on the consequences on cardiac tissue of this dysregulation and the role that it has in the formation of myocardial scarring.", "journal": "Current heart failure reports", "date": "2023-08-01", "authors": ["Elizabeth A VJones"], "doi": "10.1007/s11897-023-00618-w\n10.1007/s11239-023-02808-8\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa191\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.4916\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.054824\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058272\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.07.012\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.964512\n10.1038/s41586-020-2342-5\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa267\n10.1161/circulationaha.120.050754\n10.7326/l20-1206\n10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2022.151983\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.06.068\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.08.069\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950\n10.1161/circulationaha.122.060632\n10.1056/NEJMoa2015432\n10.1161/circulationaha.120.051828\n10.1007/s00134-021-06419-w\n10.1182/blood.V79.12.3219.3219\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)70431-1\n10.1038/nrneph.2015.177\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.112\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119376\n10.1038/nri2171\n10.3390/cells11223704\n10.1007/s00134-020-06062-x\n10.1111/jth.14850\n10.1016/j.rpth.2023.100085\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.992384\n10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30937-5\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31188-0\n10.1056/NEJMc2030450\n10.1111/bjd.19491\n10.1002/path.1570\n10.1074/jbc.M002615200\n10.1161/01.res.87.5.e1\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.03.016\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.052824\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa311\n10.3389/fphar.2022.971017\n10.15252/msb.20209610\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa078\n10.1155/2021/8874339\n10.1002/cti2.1350\n10.1007/s00395-021-00882-8\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049465\n10.1161/circulationaha.120.050907\n10.1093/infdis/jiaa528\n10.1002/ajh.25881\n10.1126/scitranslmed.abj7790\n10.1038/s41598-022-15976-z\n10.1038/s41392-021-00679-0\n10.1161/01.res.73.1.205\n10.2337/db15-1450\n10.1161/strokeaha.110.593327\n10.1016/j.niox.2021.04.003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00897.2020\n10.14814/phy2.15552\n10.1161/hypertensionaha.122.19958\n10.1161/circulationaha.109.864801\n10.1186/s43044-021-00208-y\n10.1161/01.Res.0000115557.25127.8d\n10.1016/j.immuni.2020.06.017\n10.3390/ijms222111622\n10.1056/NEJMc2033369\n10.1182/blood-2011-08-375816\n10.1158/0008-5472.Can-10-1496\n10.1177/2048872612455142\n10.1097/md.0000000000000591\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2021.09.009\n10.1161/circimaging.120.010897\n10.1016/j.healun.2020.04.025\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa306\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.3557\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1096\n10.3389/fcvm.2023.1097974\n10.1152/ajpheart.00860.2007\n10.1126/science.1631560\n10.1002/term.3327\n10.1371/journal.pone.0255976\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2022.09.001\n10.1016/j.acvdsp.2020.03.094\n10.2337/diabetes.51.10.3107\n10.1161/circulationaha.113.007469\n10.1084/jem.20051210\n10.1084/jem.20111622\n10.1038/ni.2477\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0097\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19990301)55:5<578::AID-JNR5>3.0.CO;2-E\n10.1006/mvre.2000.2244\n10.1038/srep13497\n10.1038/nature13165\n10.3389/fnins.2022.900761\n10.1093/brain/awac272\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00537.2020\n10.14814/phy2.14726\n10.1038/s41580-021-00432-z\n10.1038/s41586-020-2355-0\n10.1128/JVI.01012-07\n10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00027-6\n10.1038/s41598-021-92941-2\n10.1073/pnas.2016650117\n10.1056/NEJM199912023412302\n10.1038/s41401-022-01036-9\n10.1152/ajplung.90415.2008\n10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109020\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1010807\n10.1038/s41392-021-00726-w\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2021.12.001\n10.1038/s41556-021-00796-6\n10.1681/asn.2006090998\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000078635.89229.8A\n10.1016/S2213-2600(23)00217-5"}

{"title": "The toxic effects of electronic cigarette aerosol and cigarette smoke on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal systems in mice.", "abstract": "Electronic cigarette (EC) has been suggested to be less harmful than cigarette smoking, but the research on the full extent of their harm reduction potential is still lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of EC aerosol and cigarette smoke (CS) on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal functions in mice after prolonged exposure. Forty-eight C57BL/6J male mice were randomly grouped and then exposed to fresh air (control), mung bean-flavored EC aerosol with low and high dose (EC1L, 6\u00a0mg/kg; EC1H, 12\u00a0mg/kg), watermelon-flavored EC aerosol with low and high dose (EC2L, 6\u00a0mg/kg; EC2H, 12\u00a0mg/kg), and finally a cigarette smoke (CS, 6\u00a0mg/kg), respectively. After 10\u00a0weeks of exposure, the heart rate increased for both the EC and CS groups, and the effect of CS on blood oxygen saturation was significantly higher than that of the EC group (P\u2009<\u20090.01).

{"title": "Subchronic pulmonary toxicity of ambient particles containing cement production-related elements.", "abstract": "Chronic respiratory disease is among the most common non-communicable diseases, and particulate materials (PM) are a major risk factor. Meanwhile, evidence of the relationship between the physicochemical characteristics of PM and pulmonary toxicity mechanism is still limited. Here, we collected particles (CPM) from the air of a port city adjacent to a cement factory, and we found that the CPM contained various elements, including heavy metals (such as arsenic, thallium, barium, and zirconium) which are predicted to have originated from a cement plant adjacent to the sampling site. We also delivered the CPM intratracheally to mice for 13 weeks to investigate the pulmonary toxicity of inhaled CPM. CPM-induced chronic inflammatory lesions with an increased total number of cells in the lung of mice. Meanwhile, among inflammatory mediators measured in this study, levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, CXCL-1, and IFN-\u03b3 were elevated in the treated group compared with the controls. Considering that the alveolar macrophage (known as dust cell) is a professional phagocyte that is responsible for the clearance of PM from the respiratory surfaces, we also investigated cellular responses following exposure to CPM in MH-S cells, a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line. CPM inhibited cell proliferation and formed autophagosome-like vacuoles. Intracellular calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, and altered expression of pyrimidine metabolism- and olfactory transduction-related genes were observed in CPM-treated cells. More interestingly, type I-LC3B and full-length PARP proteins were not replenished in CPM-treated cells, and cell cycle changes, apoptotic and necrotic cell death, and caspase-3 cleavage were not significantly detected in cells exposed to CPM. Taken together, we conclude that dysfunction of alveolar macrophages may contribute to CPM-induced pulmonary inflammation. In addition, given the possible transformation of heart tissue observed in CPM-treated mice, we suggest that further study is needed to clarify the systemic pathological changes and the molecular mechanisms following chronic exposure to CPM.", "journal": "Toxicology reports", "date": "2023-07-31", "authors": ["Eun-JungPark", "Mi-JinYang", "Min-SungKang", "Young-MinJo", "CheolhoYoon", "YunseoLee", "Dong-WanKim", "Gwang-HeeLee", "Ik-HwanKwon", "Jin-BaeKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxrep.2023.07.002"}

Recently developed cardiac patches provide mechanical support and additional conductive paths to promote electrical signal propagation in the MI area to synchronize cardiac excitation and contraction. Cardiac patches based on conductive polymers offer attractive features; however, the modest levels of elasticity and high impedance interfaces limit their mechanical and electrical performance. These structures also operate as permanent implants, even in cases where their utility is limited to the healing period of tissue damaged by the MI. The work presented here introduces a highly conductive cardiac patch that combines bioresorbable metals and polymers together in a hybrid material structure configured in a thin serpentine geometry that yields elastic mechanical properties. Finite element analysis guides optimized choices of layouts in these systems. Regular and synchronous contraction of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes on the cardiac patch and ex vivo studies offer insights into the essential properties and the bio-interface.

Therefore, novel methods are needed to reduce its adverse effects. Quercetin is a natural flavonoid with many biological activities. Liposomes are lipid-based carriers widely used in medicine for drug delivery. In this study, liposomal doxorubicin with favorable characteristics was designed and synthesized by the thin-film method, and its physicochemical properties were investigated by different laboratory techniques. Then, the impact of the carrier, empty liposomes, free doxorubicin, liposomal doxorubicin, and quercetin were analyzed in animal models. To evaluate the interventions, measurements of cardiac enzymes, oxidative stress and antioxidant markers, and protein expression were performed, as well as histopathological studies. Additionally, cytotoxicity assay and cellular uptake were carried out on H9c2 cells. The mean size of the designed liposomes was 98.8 nm, and the encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was about 85%. The designed liposomes were anionic and pH-sensitive and had a controlled release pattern with excellent stability. Co-administration of liposomal doxorubicin with free quercetin to rats led to decreased weight loss, creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), while it increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase enzymes in their left ventricles. Additionally, it changed the expression of NOX1, Rac1, Rac1-GTP, SIRT3, and Bcl-2 proteins, and caused tissue injury and cell cytotoxicity. Our data showed that interventions can increase antioxidant capacity, reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis in heart tissue, and lead to fewer complications.

{"title": "Assessment of Squalene-Adenosine Nanoparticles in Two Rodent Models of Cardiac Ischemia-Reperfusion.", "abstract": "Reperfusion injuries after a period of cardiac ischemia are known to lead to pathological modifications or even death. Among the different therapeutic options proposed, adenosine, a small molecule with platelet anti-aggregate and anti-inflammatory properties, has shown encouraging results in clinical trials. However, its clinical use is severely limited because of its very short half-life in the bloodstream. To overcome this limitation, we have proposed a strategy to encapsulate adenosine in squalene-based nanoparticles (NPs), a biocompatible and biodegradable lipid. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess, whether squalene-based nanoparticles loaded with adenosine (SQAd NPs) were cardioprotective in a preclinical cardiac ischemia/reperfusion model. Obtained SQAd NPs were characterized in depth and further evaluated in vitro. The NPs were formulated with a size of about 90 nm and remained stable up to 14 days at both 4 \u00b0C and room temperature. Moreover, these NPs did not show any signs of toxicity, neither on HL-1, H9c2 cardiac cell lines, nor on human PBMC and, further retained their inhibitory platelet aggregation properties. In a mouse model with experimental cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, treatment with SQAd NPs showed a reduction of the area at risk, as well as of the infarct area, although not statistically significant. However, we noted a significant reduction of apoptotic cells on cardiac tissue from animals treated with the NPs.

{"title": "The Molecular Role of Immune Cells in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a rare and severe condition characterized by chamber dilation and impaired contraction of the left ventricle. It constitutes a fundamental etiology for profound heart failure and abrupt cardiac demise, rendering it a prominent clinical indication for heart transplantation (HTx) among both adult and pediatric populations. DCM arises from various etiologies, including genetic variants, epigenetic disorders, infectious insults, autoimmune diseases, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. The maintenance of cardiac function involves two distinct types of immune cells: resident immune cells and recruited immune cells. Resident immune cells play a crucial role in establishing a harmonious microenvironment within the cardiac tissue. Nevertheless, in response to injury, cardiomyocytes initiate a cytokine cascade that attracts peripheral immune cells, thus perturbing this intricate equilibrium and actively participating in the initiation and pathological remodeling of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), particularly during the progression of myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, immune cells assume a pivotal role in orchestrating the inflammatory processes, which are intimately linked to the prognosis of DCM. Consequently, understanding the molecular role of various immune cells and their regulation mechanisms would provide an emerging era for managing DCM. In this review, we provide a summary of the most recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of immune cells in DCM. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of immunotherapy approaches for the treatment of DCM, with the aim of optimizing future immunotherapeutic strategies for this condition.",

{"title": "Metabolic, Apoptotic and Fibro-Inflammatory Profiles of the Heart Exposed to Environmental Electromagnetic Fields.", "abstract": "Environmental stress can disturb the integrative functioning of the cardiovascular system and trigger a number of adaptive and/or maladaptive cell responses. Concomitant with the expanding use of mobile communication systems, public exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) raises the question of the impact of 900 MHz EMFs on cardiovascular health. Therefore, in this study, we experimentally investigated whether 915 MHz EMF exposure influenced cardiac metabolic, antioxidant, apoptotic, and fibro-inflammatory profiles in a mouse model. Healthy mice were sham-exposed or exposed to EMF for 14 days. Western blot analysis using whole cardiac tissue lysates demonstrated that there was no significant change in the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes between the control and EMF-exposed mice. In addition, the myocardial expression of fibro-inflammatory cytokines, antioxidant enzymes, and apoptosis-related markers remained unchanged in the EMF-challenged hearts. Finally, the structural integrity of the cardiac tissues was preserved among the groups. These findings suggest that the apoptotic, antioxidant, metabolic, and fibro-inflammatory profiles of the heart remained stable under conditions of EMF exposure in the analyzed mice.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-07-29", "authors": ["LesiaSavchenko", "IleniaMartinelli", "DimitriMarsal", "OksanaBatkivska", "VyacheslavZhdan", "IgorKaidashev", "NathaliePizzinat", "FredericBoal", "HeleneTronchere", "JunwuTao", "OksanaKunduzova"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms241411709\n10.1007/s00484-020-01885-1\n10.3390/ijms22073772\n10.1016/j.jmau.2017.07.003\n10.1016/j.ijheh.2016.08.007\n10.1177/03946320070200S212\n10.3390/ijerph20032071\n10.1016/j.envint.2022.107106\n10.1016/j.envres.2018.02.031\n10.19082/2655\n10.3389/fpubh.2018.00085\n10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.03.004\n10.1016/j.neulet.2017.12.042\n10.1016/j.jmau.2017.07.001\n10.1177/0748233713498444\n10.1371/journal.pone.0268641\n10.1177/0748233711434957\n10.1177/07482337221139586\n10.3389/fpubh.2020.00087\n10.1093/jrr/rrw090\n10.4330/wjc.v6.i6.462\n10.3390/antiox9090864\n10.1155/2020/5732956\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00694\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103992\n10.1016/j.ajpc.2020.100130\n10.1196/annals.1380.013\n10.1085/jgp.201210783\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318241\n10.3390/cells11010131\n10.3892/ijmm.2019.4188\n10.3390/antiox10030415\n10.1155/2017/8416763\n10.1083/jcb.201708007\n10.1021/cr4005296\n10.1074/jbc.272.30.18515\n10.3389/fpubh.2021.691880\n10.4062/biomolther.2018.152\n10.1016/j.brainres.2016.02.053\n10.15406/jabb.2017.04.00096\n10.1007/s00204-013-1034-4\n10.14302/issn.2641-4538.jphi-22-4197\n10.3109/15368378.2014.906446\n10.3390/ijms23042322\n10.5115/acb.2017.50.2.115\n10.1002/bem.20274\n10.1186/1756-9966-30-87\n10.3389/fcvm.2023.1205893\n10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121627\n10.3390/biomedicines10050929"}
{"title": "Advances in 3D Bioprinting: Techniques, Applications, and Future Directions for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac tissue engineering is a direction in regenerative medicine that aims to repair various heart defects with the long-term goal of artificially rebuilding a full-scale organ that matches its native structure and function. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting offers promising applications through its layer-by-layer biomaterial deposition using different techniques and bio-inks. In this review, we will introduce cardiac tissue engineering, 3D bioprinting processes, bioprinting techniques, bio-ink materials, areas of limitation, and the latest applications of this technology, alongside its future directions for further innovation.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-07-29", "authors": ["Catherine AWu", "YuanjiaZhu", "Y JosephWoo"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering10070842\n10.1016/j.trsl.2019.04.004\n10.2174/1381612825666190925163827\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001123\n10.1186/s13073-018-0550-5\n10.1016/j.msec.2021.112057\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.10.021\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2017.11.008\n10.7150/thno.61621\n10.1186/s13036-019-0185-0\n10.1126/science.aam5894\n10.1073/pnas.1808317115\n10.1073/pnas.1000256107\n10.2174/157488812804484657\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.778886\n10.1038/s41569-020-0422-8\n10.1016/j.ahj.2012.05.011\n10.1056/NEJMoa1716026\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.11.050\n10.1159/000492704\n10.1038/s41587-019-0197-9\n10.1038/s41467-019-13868-x\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0352\n10.1007/s00586-008-0745-3\n10.1016/j.msec.2021.111896\n10.1002/adma.201305506\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.014\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199910)47:1<8::AID-JBM2>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01062\n10.1016/j.smmf.2022.100011\n10.1002/adhm.201600182\n10.1002/adfm.201503423\n10.1039/C8LC01037D\n10.2217/3dp-2016-0009\n10.1126/science.aau7114\n10.1002/adhm.201601118\n10.1063/5.0004340\n10.1002/adhm.201500677\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab5158\n10.1089/ten.tea.2019.0298\n10.1002/term.481\n10.1002/btpr.337\n10.1152/ajpheart.00171.2003\n10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610974\n10.1097/MAT.0000000000000486\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b00400\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.09.035\n10.1002/adma.200901141\n10.1016/j.ajps.2019.11.003\n10.1039/c3tb20745e\n10.1021/la501430x\n10.1177/2211068214567146\n10.2147/AHCT.S69191\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.012\n10.1081/AL-120037587\n10.1039/b904984c\n10.1115/1.3002759\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2243912\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/032002\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.056\n10.1002/adma.200300385\n10.1089/ten.tec.2010.0359\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.02.097\n10.2961/jlmn.2016.02.0010\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0397\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.055\n10.1177/2041731418802090\n10.1016/j.gendis.2017.10.002\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.09.048\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.020\n10.3390/bioengineering4030071\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308538\n10.1155/2018/8719624\n10.1016/j.bprint.2019.e00040\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120204\n10.1080/10601320701235958\n10.1177/2041731417744485\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00149\n10.1016/j.isci.2023.106039\n10.1115/1.4028512\n10.3390/jfb13020040\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1038/srep29977\n10.1080/10667857.2018.1456616\n10.1038/srep13427\n10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01764\n10.1002/adhm.201800672\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.026\n10.1155/2015/925757\n10.1007/s10439-016-1607-5\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.003\n10.1002/jbm.b.34123\n10.1002/adma.201405076\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00643\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.08.020\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.009\n10.18063/ijb.v4i1.127\n10.1038/s41598-018-31848-x\n10.1002/adfm.202003440\n10.1002/adfm.201605352\n10.21037/mps.2018.10.02\n10.1126/sciadv.aaw2459\n10.1080/07853890701881788\n10.1002/adhm.201900065\n10.1089/ten.teb.2016.0322\n10.1016/j.bprint.2019.e00048\n10.1002/adhm.201901831\n10.1371/journal.pone.0209162\n10.3791/50288\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b00505\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2019.12.020\n10.1088/1758-5090/aae605\n10.1126/sciadv.1500758\n10.3390/bioengineering9120807\n10.1089/ten.tec.2022.0214\n10.1039/C7BM00765E\n10.1186/s40824-018-0122-1\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045002\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5b00525\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.06.003\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00033-8\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.11.008\n10.1073/pnas.1421897112\n10.1089/tea.2007.0173\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.10.015\n10.1007/s13770-017-0057-y\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)69462-7\n10.1016/j.jpba.2009.05.035\n10.1016/S1010-7940(00)00373-0\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0234\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0032\n10.1088/1758-5082/2/2/022001\n10.1016/S1010-7940(01)00624-8\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00158\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.005\n10.1016/j.apmt.2020.100656\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00353-8\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.04.167\n10.1016/S0927-7765(99)00063-6\n10.1089/ten.tec.2013.0213\n10.1002/adma.201503310\n10.1039/c2lc40213k\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.12.009\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.07.014\n10.1021/acsami.8b19953\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01008\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2008.03.067\n10.1021/acsami.8b18844\n10.1021/nn305559j\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.1088/1758-5082/1/3/035001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.02.007\n10.1007/s10856-021-06520-y\n10.1126/science.aav9051\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316155\n10.1002/adhm.201700264\n10.1002/adfm.202105080\n10.1093/ejcts/ezaa093\n10.1016/j.bprint.2021.e00177\n10.1016/j.drudis.2016.04.006\n10.1177/20417314211027677\n10.1111/cts.12315\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.855042"}

A three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted neurocardiac scaffold composed of a mixture of gelatin-alginate and alginate-genipin-fibrin hydrogels was developed with a 2:1 ratio of AC16 cardiomyocytes (CMs) and retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells (NCs) respectively. A unique semi-3D bioprinting approach was adopted, where the CMs were mixed in the cardiac bioink and printed using an anisotropic accordion design to mimic the physiological tissue architecture in vivo. The voids in this 3D structure were methodically filled in using a NC-gel mixture and crosslinked. Confocal fluorescent imaging using microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and anticholine acetyltransferase (CHAT) antibodies for labeling the NCs and the MyoD1 antibody for the CMs revealed functional coupling between the two cell types in the final crosslinked structure. These data confirmed the development of a relevant neurocardiac model that could be used to study neurocardiac modulation under physiological and pathological conditions.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-07-29", "authors": ["IvanaHernandez", "Salma PRamirez", "Wendy VSalazar", "SarahiMendivil", "AndreaGuevara", "AkshayPatel", "Carla DLoyola", "Zayra NDorado", "BinataJoddar"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering10070834\n10.1002/clc.23190\n10.1111/jce.15058\n10.1113/JP273120\n10.2174/157340211501190129144451\n10.1056/NEJMe2000239\n10.1002/jbm.b.34123\n10.1152/ajpheart.00546.2020\n10.34133/2021/9864212\n10.3390/cells8080830\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.05.002\n10.3389/fcell.2022.850645\n10.1016/j.isci.2021.102795\n10.1016/j.xpro.2022.101348\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01235\n10.3390/chemosensors10050173\n10.3390/gels4030073\n10.1088/0957-4484/22/49/494003\n10.1186/s13024-017-0149-0\n10.3233/JAD-2010-091363\n10.3390/md13127068\n10.1155/2010/608749\n10.1002/pol.1959.1203913521\n10.1021/bi00173a015\n10.1002/pola.20669\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b00505\n10.3390/pr9071205\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12250\n10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105737"}
{"title": "Doxorubicin Dose-Dependent Impact on Physiological Balance-A Holistic Approach in a Rat Model.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is commonly used in several chemotherapies to treat various cancers, but it is known to cause cardiotoxicity and cardiac symptoms. Autonomic dysfunction is thought to contribute to the cardiotoxic effects of DOX, but the specific dose required to disrupt homeostatic processes is still unclear and is influenced by numerous factors. This study aimed to investigate how the DOX dosage affects autonomic function and physiological parameters, to elucidate the neurocardiac mechanisms underlying the observed cardiovascular side effects. Wistar rats were treated with DOX for four weeks and divided into three dosing groups: DOX8 (2 mg/kg/week), DOX16 (4 mg/kg/week), and DOX20 (5 mg/kg/week). A control group received NaCl 0.9% saline (1 mL/kg/week). In an acute experiment, we recorded blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram, heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RF). Baroreflex gain and chemoreflex sensitivity were calculated, and cardiac tissue was analyzed with picrosirius histochemistry to measure collagen content. Our results showed that the LF/HF ratio, indicative of autonomic activity, was altered along with hypotension and bradycardia at a cumulative DOX dose threshold of 16 mg/kg. We observed a positive correlation between DOX dose and BP, HR, urinary norepinephrine, LF/HF ratio, and fibrotic heart area. Lower LF/HF ratios were associated with high DOX doses, reflecting drug-induced impairment of autonomic control of HR. This study provides valuable insights into the dose-dependent effects of DOX on physiological parameters and the development of cardiovascular dysfunction.

Thus, intercalated discs, specialized cell-cell contact sites that provide electrical and mechanical coupling between cardiomyocytes, are an important target for study. Impaired propagation leads to arrhythmias in many pathologies, where intercalated disc remodeling is a common finding, hence the importance and urgency of understanding propagation dependence on intercalated disc structure. Conventional modeling approaches cannot predict changes in propagation elicited by perturbations that alter intercalated disc ultrastructure or molecular organization, because of lack of quantitative structural data at subcellular through nano scales.\nThis study sought to quantify intercalated disc structure at these spatial scales in the healthy adult mouse heart and relate them to chamber-specific properties of propagation as a precursor to understanding the effects of pathological intercalated disc remodeling.\nUsing super-resolution light microscopy, electron microscopy, and computational image analysis, we provide here the first ever systematic, multiscale quantification of intercalated disc ultrastructure and molecular organization.\nBy incorporating these data into a rule-based model of cardiac tissue with realistic intercalated disc structure, and comparing model predictions of electrical propagation with experimental measures of conduction velocity, we reveal that atrial intercalated discs can support faster conduction than their ventricular counterparts, which is normally masked by interchamber differences in myocyte geometry. Further, we identify key ultrastructural and molecular organization features underpinning the ability of atrial intercalated discs to support faster conduction.\nThese data provide the first stepping stone to elucidating chamber-specific effects of pathological intercalated disc remodeling, as occurs in many arrhythmic diseases.", "journal": "JACC.

Previous quantitative proteomics analyses demonstrated widespread molecular defects in the severe Taiwanese SMA mouse model. Whether such changes are conserved across different mouse models, including less severe forms of the disease, has yet to be established. Here, using the same high-resolution proteomics approach in the less-severe Smn2B/- SMA mouse model, 277 proteins were found to be differentially abundant at a symptomatic timepoint (post-natal day (P) 18), 50 of which were similarly dysregulated in severe Taiwanese SMA mice. Bioinformatics analysis linked many of the differentially abundant proteins to cardiovascular development and function, with intermediate filaments highlighted as an enriched cellular compartment in both datasets. Lamin A/C was increased in the cardiac tissue, whereas another intermediate filament protein, desmin, was reduced. The extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, elastin, was also robustly decreased in the heart of Smn2B/- mice. AAV9-SMN1-mediated gene therapy rectified low levels of survival motor neuron protein and restored desmin levels in heart tissues of Smn2B/- mice. In contrast, AAV9-SMN1 therapy failed to correct lamin A/C or elastin levels. Intermediate filament proteins and the ECM have key roles in cardiac function and their dysregulation may explain cardiac impairment in SMA, especially since mutations in genes encoding these proteins cause other diseases with cardiac aberration. Cardiac pathology may need to be considered in the long-term care of SMA patients, as it is unclear whether currently available treatments can fully rescue peripheral pathology in SMA.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2023-07-27", "authors": ["Sharon JBrown", "Darija\u0160olti\u0107", "Silvia ASynowsky", "Sally LShirran", "EllieChilcott", "Hannah KShorrock", "Thomas HGillingwater", "Rafael JY\u00e1\u00f1ez-Mu\u00f1oz", "BernardSchneider", "MelissaBowerman", "Heidi RFuller"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddad121\n10.1038/s41434-023-00406-0"}

However, researchers have not clearly determined whether and how one-carbon metabolic enzymes contribute to heart transplant rejection.\nWe investigated the dynamic metabolic adaptation in grafts during heart transplant rejection by conducting transcriptomics, metabolomics and single-cell RNA sequencing studies of cardiac tissue from human and mouse heart transplant recipients. We also assessed the expression of the one-carbon metabolic enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) in cardiac grafts by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays. Then we constructed a murine heart transplant model with T cell-specific Mthfd2 knockout mice, analyzed T cells function by flow cytometry assays and enzyme-linked immunospot assays, and studied the mechanism by Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation assays. Finally, we studied the effect of a pharmacological inhibitor of MTHFD2 in humanized skin transplant model.\nWe revealed that the one-carbon metabolism enzyme MTHFD2 was a hallmark of alloreactive T cells and was linked to T cell proliferation and function after exposure to alloantigen. And, Mthfd2 ablation prevented murine heart transplant rejection. Mechanistically, we found Mthfd2 ablation affected the interferon regulatory factor 4/programmed death-1 pathway through a metabolic-epigenetic mechanism involving H3K4me3. Furthermore, we found that inhibiting MTHFD2 attenuated human allograft rejection in a humanized skin transplant model.\nThese data show that the one-carbon metabolic enzyme MTHFD2 serves as a metabolic checkpoint of alloreactive T cells and suggest that it may be a potential therapeutic target for heart transplant rejection.", "journal": "The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation", "date": "2023-07-27", "authors": ["YuanLi", "ZhangChen", "JikaiCui", "JizhangYu", "YuqingNiu", "ShuanRan", "SongWang", "WeicongYe", "HengXu", "XiZhang", "JieWu", "JiahongXia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.healun.2023.07.009"}
{"title": "C-type natriuretic peptide induces inotropic and lusitropic effects in human 3D-engineered cardiac tissue: Implications for the regulation of cardiac function in humans.", "abstract": "The role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in the regulation of cardiac function in humans remains to be established as previous investigations have been confined to animal model systems. Here, we used well-characterized engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) generated from human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts to study the acute effects of CNP on contractility. Application of CNP elicited a positive inotropic response as evidenced by increases in maximum twitch amplitude, maximum contraction slope and maximum calcium amplitude. This inotropic response was accompanied by a positive lusitropic response as demonstrated by reductions in time from peak contraction to 90% of relaxation and time from peak calcium transient to 90% of decay that paralleled increases in maximum contraction decay slope and maximum calcium decay slope. To establish translatability, CNP-induced changes in contractility were also assessed in rat ex vivo (isolated heart) and in vivo models. Here, the effects on force kinetics observed in ECTs mirrored those observed in both the ex vivo and in vivo model systems, whereas the increase in maximal force generation with CNP application was only detected in ECTs. In conclusion, CNP induces a positive inotropic and lusitropic response in ECTs, thus supporting an important role for CNP in the regulation of human cardiac function. The high degree of translatability between ECTs, ex vivo and in vivo models further supports a regulatory role for CNP and expands the current understanding of the translational value of human ECTs. NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? What are the acute responses to C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in human-engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) on cardiac function and how well do they translate to matched concentrations in animal ex vivo and in vivo models? What is the main finding and its importance? Acute stimulation of ECTs with CNP induced positive lusitropic and inotropic effects on cardiac contractility, which closely reflected the changes observed in rat ex vivo and in vivo cardiac models.

Ozone is a powerful oxidizer, but low concentrations of ozone can protect various organs from oxidative stress. Some studies have demonstrated a link between ozone and myocardioprotection, but the mechanism remains unclear. To establish an in vivo animal model of ischemiareperfusion injury (I/R), this study utilized C57 mice, while an in vitro model of hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury was developed using H9c2 cardiomyocytes to simulate ischemiareperfusion injury. Ozone pretreatment was used in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Through this research, we found that ozone therapy can reduce myocardial injury, and further studies found that ozone regulates the expression levels of these ferroptosis-related proteins and transcription factors in the H/R model, which were screened by bioinformatics. In particular, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was enhanced by pretreatment with ozone, inhibited ferroptosis and ameliorated oxidative stress by initiating the expression of Slc7a11 and Gpx4. Significantly, Nrf2 gene silencing reverses the protective effects of ozone in the H/R model.

The coronary microvascular anatomy and flow velocity was reconstructed using dedicated ULM algorithms and analyzed quantitatively.\nWe were able to image the coronary microcirculation of ex\u00a0vivo swine hearts at a resolution of tens of microns and measure flow velocities ranging from 10\u00a0mm/s in arterioles up to more than 200\u00a0mm/s in epicardial arteries. Under different aortic perfusion pressures, we measured in large arteries of a subset of control hearts an increase of flow velocity from 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0mm/s at 87\u00a0mmHg to 47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0mm/s at 132\u00a0mmHg (N\u00a0=\u00a03 hearts, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This increase was compared with a control measurement with a flowmeter in the aorta. We also compared 6 control hearts to 4 hearts in which no-reflow was induced by the occlusion and reperfusion of a coronary artery. Using average MB velocity and average density of MB per unit of surface as two ULM quantitative markers of perfusion, we were able to detect areas of coronary no-reflow in good agreement with a control anatomical pathology analysis of the cardiac tissue. In the no-reflow zone, we measured an average perfusion of 204\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0305\u00a0MB/mm\nWe demonstrated this approach can directly image and quantify coronary microvascular obstruction and no-reflow on large mammal perfused hearts. This is a first step for noninvasive, quantitative and affordable assessment of the coronary microcirculation function and particularly coronary microvascular anatomy in the infarcted heart. This approach has the potential to be extended to other clinical situations characterized by microvascular dysfunction.\nThis study was supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) under ANR-21-CE19-0002 grant agreement.", "journal": "EBioMedicine", "date": "2023-07-25", "authors": ["OscarDemeulenaere", "PhilippeMateo", "Ren\u00e9Ferrera", "Paul-MathieuChiaroni", "AlainBiz\u00e9", "JianpingDai", "LucienSambin", "RomainGallet", "Micka\u00eblTanter", "Cl\u00e9mentPapadacci", "BijanGhaleh", "MathieuPernot"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104727\n10.1117/12.350684.full\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.23.2734"}
{"title": "Resveratrol inhibits ferroptosis and decelerates heart failure progression via Sirt1/p53 pathway activation.", "abstract": "Resveratrol is an organic compound widely studied for its therapeutic uses. We investigated whether resveratrol exerts cardioprotective effects by inhibiting ferroptosis via the Sirt1/p53 pathway. A heart failure model was established by aortic coarctation in Sirt1 knockout mice. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) levels and mitochondrial morphology in murine heart tissues were assessed at different time points to determine the role of ferroptosis in heart failure progression. The cardiac function of mice with heart failure was evaluated by determining the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and sST2 concentration and conducting echocardiography. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were transfected with the p53 K382R mutant and Sirt1 interference lentiviral vectors. Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were performed to investigate whether Sirt1 influences ferroptosis via p53 K382 acetylation and SLC7A11 expression modulation. Resveratrol improved cardiac function in mice and decelerated ferroptosis and fibrosis progression in heart failure. However, the ability of resveratrol to prevent ferroptosis and treat heart failure was lost after silencing Sirt1. Sirt1 reduced ferroptosis by diminishing the levels of p53 K382 acetylation, reducing the degradation of SLC7A11, and increasing the levels of GSH and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in cells. In conclusion, by activating the Sirt1/p53 pathway in heart failure, resveratrol decreased the depletion of SLC7A11, inhibited ferroptosis, and improved cardiac function.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2023-07-24", "authors": ["WeiZhang", "ShaohuanQian", "BiTang", "PinfangKang", "HengZhang", "ChaoShi"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.17874"}

{"title": "Toxic effects of four emerging pollutants on cardiac performance and associated physiological parameters of the thick-shell mussel (Mytilus coruscus).", "abstract": "Robust cardiac performance is critical for the health and even survival of an animal; however, it is sensitive to environmental stressors. At present, little is known about the cardiotoxicity of emerging pollutants to bivalve mollusks. Thus, in this study, the cardiotoxic effects of four emergent pollutants, carbamazepine (CBZ), bisphenol A (BPA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), on the thick-shell mussel, Mytilus coruscus, were evaluated by heartbeat monitoring and histological examinations. In addition, the impacts of these pollutants on parameters that closely related to cardiac function including neurotransmitters, calcium homeostasis, energy supply, and oxidative status were assessed. Our results demonstrated that 28-day exposure of the thick-shell mussel to these pollutants resulted in evident heart tissue lesions (indicated by hemocyte infiltration and myocardial fibrosis) and disruptions of cardiac performance (characterized by bradyrhythmia and arrhythmia). In addition to obstructing neurotransmitters and calcium homeostasis, exposure to pollutants also led to constrained energy supply and induced oxidative stress in mussel hearts. These findings indicate that although do differ somehow in their effects, these four pollutants may exert cardiotoxic impacts on mussels, which could pose severe threats to this important species and therefore deserves more attention.", "journal": "Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)", "date": "2023-07-24", "authors": ["YingyingYu", "DifeiTong", "YihanYu", "DandanTian", "WeishangZhou", "XunyiZhang", "WeiShi", "GuangxuLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122244"}

In vitro, these perfusable vascular networks exhibit remodeling and evenly distributed perfusion among layers, while maintaining their patterned, open-lumen architecture. Compared to non-perfusable, self-assembled vasculature, constructs with perfusable vasculature demonstrated increased gene expression indicative of vascular development and angiogenesis. Upon implantation onto infarcted rat hearts, perfusable vascular networks attain greater host vascular integration than self-assembled controls, indicated by 2.5-fold greater perfused vascular density measured by histological analysis and 5-fold greater perfusion rate measured by optical microangiography.

{"title": "Recurrence quantification analysis for fine-scale characterisation of arrhythmic patterns in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "This paper uses recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) combined with entropy measures and organization indices to characterize arrhythmic patterns and dynamics in computer simulations of cardiac tissue. We performed different simulations of cardiac tissues of sizes comparable to the human heart atrium. In these simulations, we observed four classic arrhythmic patterns: a spiral wave anchored to a highly fibrotic region resulting in sustained re-entry, a meandering spiral wave, fibrillation, and a spiral wave anchored to a scar region that breaks up into wavelets away from the main rotor. A detailed analysis revealed that, within the same simulation, maps of RQA metrics could differentiate regions with regular AP propagation from ones with chaotic activity. In particular, the combination of two RQA metrics, the length of the longest diagonal string of recurrence points and the mean length of diagonal lines, was able to identify the location of rotor tips, which are the active elements that maintain spiral waves and fibrillation. By proposing low-dimensional models based on the mean value and spatial correlation of metrics calculated from membrane potential time series, we identify RQA-based metrics that successfully separate the four different types of cardiac arrhythmia into distinct regions of the feature space, and thus might be used for automatic classification, in particular distinguishing between fibrillation driven by self-sustaining chaos and that created by a persistent rotor and wavebreak.

{"title": "3-Indolepropionic acid mitigates sub-acute toxicity in the cardiomyocytes of epirubicin-treated female rats.", "abstract": "Epirubicin (EPI) is an effective chemotherapeutic against breast cancer, though EPI-related cardiotoxicity limits its usage. Endogenously derived 3-indolepropionic acid (3-IPA) from tryptophan metabolism is of interest due to its antioxidant capabilities which may have cardioprotective effects. Supplementation with 3-IPA may abate EPI's cardiotoxicity, and herein we studied the possibility of lessening EPI-induced cardiotoxicity in Wistar rats. Experimental rats (n\u2009=\u200930; BW 180-200\u00a0g) were randomly distributed in five cohorts (A-E; n\u2009=\u20096 each). Group A (control), Group B (EPI 2.5\u00a0mg/mL), and group C (3-IPA 40\u00a0mg/kg) while Groups D and E were co-treated with EPI (2.5\u00a0mg/mL) together with 3-IPA (D: 20 and E: 40\u00a0mg/kg). Following sacrifice, oxidative status, lipid profile, transaminases relevant to cardiac function, and inflammatory biomarkers were analysed. Also, 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). EPI-initiated increases in cardiotoxicity biomarkers were significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) reduced by 3-IPA supplementation. Decreased antioxidant and increases in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), 8-OHdG and lipid peroxidation were lessened (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in rat hearts co-treated with 3-IPA. EPI-induced increases in nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase were reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.05) by 3-IPA co-treatment. In addition, 3-IPA reversed EPI-mediated alterations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate amino transaminases (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and serum lipid profile including total cholesterol and triglycerides.

Its alteration is the cause of gene expression changes responsible for several diseases. Thus, we need new tools to study this aspect of gene expression regulation. To this end, ChromEM was recently developed: this is an electron-microscopy staining technique that selectively marks nuclear DNA without altering its structure and, thus, allows better visualization of 3D chromatin conformation. However, despite increasingly frequent application of this staining technique on cells, it has not yet been applied to visualize chromatin ultrastructure in tissues. Here, we provide a protocol to carry out ChromEM on myocardial tissue harvested from the left ventricles of C57BL/6J mice and use this in combination with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to measure some morphological parameters of peripheral heterochromatin in cardiomyocytes. This protocol could also be used, in combination with electron tomography, to study 3D chromatin organization in cardiomyocytes in different aspects of heart pathobiology (e.g., heart development, cardiac aging, and heart failure) as well as help to set-up ChromEM in other tissues.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2023-07-21", "authors": ["ElettraMusolino", "ChristinaPagiatakis", "FedericaPierin", "DanieleSabatino", "GiovannaFinzi", "RosalbaGornati", "GiovanniBernardini", "RobertoPapait"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2023.1123114\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.682397\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00186\n10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.037\n10.1093/jmicro/dfaa058\n10.1016/B978-0-12-819414-0.00020-3\n10.1038/s41467-021-24243-0\n10.1038/ncomms5450\n10.1038/s12276-022-00768-2\n10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2008.08.004\n10.3389/fcell.2021.774719\n10.1038/s41598-022-16028-2\n10.1126/sciadv.abe4310\n10.1039/d1na00682g\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.052\n10.1186/s13072-022-00435-w\n10.1126/science.aag0025\n10.1152/physrev.00037.2019\n10.1017/S1431927621000532\n10.1101/gad.1941010\n10.3390/ijms21061911\n10.1038/s41467-020-15987-2\n10.1111/febs.14938\n10.3390/dna2010003\n10.1038/s41467-019-09320-9\n10.1039/d0na00359j"}

However, the health behavior impact of false AF alerts from wearables on older patients at high risk for AF are not known. In this work, we analyzed data from the Pulsewatch (NCT03761394) study, which randomized patients (\u226550 years) with history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to wear a patch monitor and a smartwatch linked to a smartphone running the Pulsewatch application vs to only the cardiac patch monitor over 14 days. At baseline and 14 days, participants completed validated instruments to assess for anxiety, patient activation, perceived mental and physical health, chronic symptom management self-efficacy, and medicine adherence. We employed linear regression to examine associations between false AF alerts with change in patient-reported outcomes. Receipt of false AF alerts was related to a dose-dependent decline in self-perceived physical health and levels of disease self-management. We developed a novel convolutional denoising autoencoder (CDA) to remove motion and noise artifacts in photoplethysmography (PPG) segments to optimize AF detection, which substantially reduced the number of false alerts.

However, hECT systems are often bottlenecked by a lack of openly available software that can collect data from multiple tissues at a time, even in multi-tissue bioreactors, which limits throughput in phenotypic and therapeutic screening applications.\nWe developed Rian\u00fa, an open-source web application capable of simultaneously tracking multiple hECTs on flexible end-posts. This software is operating system agnostic and deployable on a remote server, accessible via a web browser with no local hardware or software requirements. The software incorporates object-tracking capabilities for multiple objects simultaneously, an algorithm for twitch tracing analysis and contractile force calculation, and a data compilation system for comparative analysis within and amongst groups. Validation tests were performed using in-silico and in-vitro experiments for comparison with established methods and interventions.\nRian\u00fa was able to detect the displacement of the flexible end-posts with a sub-pixel sensitivity of 0.555 px/post (minimum increment in post displacement) and a lower limit of 1.665 px/post (minimum post displacement). Compared to our established reference for contractility assessment, Rian\u00fa had a high correlation for all parameters analyzed (ranging from \nRian\u00fa provides simultaneous tracking of multiple hECTs, expediting the recording and analysis processes, and simplifies time-based intervention studies.

We investigated all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event risk in a cohort of patients with RTH\u03b2, followed-up in UK endocrine clinics.\nIn a retrospective cohort design, we linked genetically confirmed patients with RTH\u03b2 and age-matched and sex-matched population controls to outcomes in datasets within the Welsh Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a crucial role in developing cardiac remodelling by inducing energy imbalance, inflammation, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-induced fibrosis. Ang II directly or through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation impairs AMPK signalling with well-known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects.\nThis study aimed to investigate the role of bempedoic acid, a novel antihyperlipidemic drug, in attenuating hypertension-induced cardiac remodelling in rats by modulating Ang II-induced damage and activating the AMPK signalling pathway.\nSixty adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated into the Sham control group, Hypertensive group, Captopril group (30\u00a0mg/kg), and Bempedoic acid group (30\u00a0mg/kg). Hypertension was induced by left renal artery ligation in all groups except the Sham control group. Treatment with captopril and bempedoic acid started 14\u00a0days post-surgy and lasted two weeks. Finally, Hemodynamic measurements and electrocardiographic examination were done followed by heart tissue samples collection for biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical examinations.\nBempedoic acid preserved the cardiac function and electrocardiogram patterns. It inhibited endoplasmic reticulum stress, exhibited antioxidant activity, and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. Bempedoic acid interfered with ERK signalling pathways, including nuclear factor-\u03baB and TGF-\u03b2, exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.\nThese findings indicate the cardioprotective and antihypertrophic activity of bempedoic acid, which are suggested to result from energy-independent AMPK downstream signalling activation.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2023-07-21", "authors": ["Asmaa AAhmed", "Shimaa KMohamed", "ShahiraNofal", "Engy MEl Morsy", "Amany A EAhmed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121963"}

Danicamtiv is a novel myosin activator with promising preclinical data that is currently in clinical trials. While it is known that danicamtiv increases force and cardiomyocyte contractility without affecting calcium levels, detailed mechanistic studies regarding its mode of action are lacking.\nPermeabilized porcine cardiac tissue and myofibrils were used for X-ray diffraction and mechanical measurements. A mouse model of genetic dilated cardiomyopathy was used to evaluate the ability of danicamtiv to correct the contractile deficit.\nDanicamtiv increased force and calcium sensitivity via increasing the number of myosins in the ON state and slowing cross-bridge turnover. Our detailed analysis showed that inhibition of ADP release results in decreased cross-bridge turnover with cross bridges staying attached longer and prolonging myofibril relaxation. Danicamtiv corrected decreased calcium sensitivity in demembranated tissue, abnormal twitch magnitude and kinetics in intact cardiac tissue, and reduced ejection fraction in the whole organ.\nAs demonstrated by the detailed studies of Danicamtiv, increasing myosin recruitment and altering cross-bridge cycling are 2 mechanisms to increase force and calcium sensitivity in cardiac muscle.

{"title": "Effect of trehalose on heart functions in rats model after myocardial infarction: assessment of novel intraventricular pressure and heart rate variability.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarctions remain a leading cause of global deaths. Developing novel drugs to target cardiac remodeling after myocardial injury is challenging. There is an increasing interest in exploring natural cardioprotective agents and non-invasive tools like intraventricular pressure gradients (IVPG) and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in myocardial infarctions. Trehalose (TRE), a natural disaccharide, shows promise in treating atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and neurodegenerative disorders.\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of TRE in improving cardiac functions measured by IVPG and HRV and reducing myocardial remodeling following myocardial infarction in rat model.\nRats were divided into three groups: sham, myocardial infarction (MI), and trehalose-treated MI (TRE) groups. The animals in the MI and TRE groups underwent permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery. The TRE group received 2% trehalose in their drinking water for four weeks after the surgery. At the end of the experiment, heart function was assessed using conventional echocardiography, novel color M-mode echocardiography for IVPG evaluation, and HRV analysis. After euthanasia, gross image scoring, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to evaluate inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.\nThe MI group exhibited significantly lower values in multiple IVPG parameters. In contrast, TRE administration showed an ameliorative effect on IVPG changes, with results comparable to the sham group. Additionally, TRE improved HRV parameters, mitigated morphological changes induced by myocardial infarction, reduced histological alterations in wall mass, and suppressed inflammatory reactions within the infarcted heart tissues. Furthermore, TRE demonstrated antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic properties.\nThe investigation into the effect of trehalose on a myocardial infarction rat model has yielded promising outcomes, as evidenced by improvements observed through conventional echocardiography, histological analysis, and immunohistochemical analysis. While minor trends were noticed in IVPG and HRV measurements. However, our findings offer valuable insights and demonstrate a correlation between IVPG, HRV, and other traditional markers of echo assessment in the myocardial infarction vs. sham groups. This alignment suggests the potential of IVPG and HRV as additional indicators for future research in this field.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2023-07-20", "authors": ["AhmedFarag", "Ahmed SMandour", "MasahiroKaneda", "AhmedElfadadny", "AsmaaElhaieg", "KazumiShimada", "RyouTanaka"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2023.1182628\n10.1038/nm.2507\n10.3389/fvets.2023.1103229\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu299\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.4103/1673-5374.308085\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.078212\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.02.066\n10.1007/s00380-021-01990-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.578161\n10.1038/s41598-019-56847-4\n10.3390/ani11041122\n10.1177/1742271X20987584\n10.1152/ajpheart.00081.2006\n10.18632/aging.101386\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.5.1043\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn537\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.11.221\n10.1038/s41392-019-0089-y\n10.1007/s00395-022-00911-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.01.008\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b00658\n10.3390/life12030442\n10.3389/fvets.2022.1064836\n10.46582/jsrm.0501006\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.010\n10.36468/pharmaceutical-sciences.spl.121\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.08.097\n10.1016/j.echo.2004.04.011\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa110\n10.1016/j.echo.2005.10.005\n10.1016/S1071-9164(99)90006-4\n10.3390/diagnostics11081403\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2012.05.013\n10.1007/s10396-020-01021-x\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7526-6_6\n10.1152/ajpheart.00379.2020\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.843144\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2012.03335.x\n10.1007/s003950170054\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.2.H772\n10.3389/fpubh.2017.00258\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfp135\n10.1186/1756-8722-7-1\n10.1002/ar.24915\n10.1016/j.archoralbio.2011.05.012\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.3758/BRM.41.4.1149\n10.1152/ajpheart.1991.260.5.H1406\n10.1093/cvr/cvn057\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.12.016\n10.1016/S0254-6272(15)30155-2\n10.1097/00004728-200403000-00021\n10.1152/ajpheart.00559.2011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00686.2018\n10.3390/ani12010056\n10.1161/01.RES.87.3.235\n10.30802/AALAS-CM-20-000042\n10.1016/j.bfopcu.2013.03.001\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110773\n10.1023/A:1015359332161\n10.3390/ph14070597\n10.1016/j.cjca.2018.08.009\n10.1126/scisignal.aac5472\n10.4161/auto.21488\n10.1074/jbc.M609532200\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003833\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.500447\n10.1016/0002-9149(88)90917-4\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2019.03.007\n10.1152/ajpheart.1997.273.5.H2240\n10.1152/ajpheart.01373.2007\n10.1016/0735-1097(91)90497-W\n10.1016/0735-1097(93)90349-6\n10.1016/S0022-0736(05)80272-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.1993.264.6.H2111\n10.1152/ajpheart.1987.253.1.H176\n10.1152/ajpheart.00607.2017\n10.1136/hrt.47.1.55\n10.1016/0002-8703(81)90408-7\n10.1016/0002-9149(87)90601-1\n10.1161/01.RES.59.2.178\n10.1126/science.6166045\n10.1016/B978-0-444-53491-0.00031-6\n10.1161/01.CIR.85.6.2073\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000047275.25795.17\n10.1385/NCC:1:3:347\n10.2174/157339910793499128\n10.1186/s12933-016-0411-8\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2006.11.009\n10.1016/S0002-9149(99)80267-7\n10.1007/BF00314190\n10.1046/j.1365-2710.2002.00404.x\n10.3389/fvets.2022.935437\n10.3389/fvets.2022.908829\n10.1016/j.autneu.2012.05.005\n10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11144-8\n10.1111/1755-5922.12248\n10.1152/physrev.1999.79.1.215\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.015\n10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9\n10.1007/s10735-018-9793-0\n10.4330/wjc.v7.i2.52\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31829f753d\n10.1007/s00059-019-4785-8\n10.1007/s00059-019-4788-5\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2018.05.010\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11463\n10.2174/1381612824666180614090224\n10.1007/s11883-017-0660-3\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110071\n10.1254/jphs.10078FP\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.12.024\n10.1016/j.phymed.2008.08.005"}

{"title": "Involvement of HIF1\u03b1/Reg protein in the regulation of HMGB3 in myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia and infarction are the number one cause of cardiovascular disease associated mortality. Cardiomyocyte death during ischemia leads to the loss of cardiac tissue and initiates a signaling cascade between the infarct zone and the area at risk of the myocardium. Here, we sought to determine the involvement of one of the damage-associated molecular patterns HMGB3 in myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nWe used the left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model to study the involvement of HMGB3 in myocardial ischemia and infarction. Our results indicated the presence of HMGB3 at a low level under normal conditions, while myocardial injury caused a robust increase in HMGB3 levels in the heart. Further, intra-cardiac injection of mabHMGB3 had improved cardiac function at day 3 by downregulating HMGB3 levels. In contrast, injection of recombinant rat HMGB3 for 7\u00a0days during the adaptation phase of myocardial ischemia improved cardiac functional parameters by increasing regenerative protein family expression. Further, to mimic the disease condition, neonatal rat ventricle cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were exposed to hypoxia; we observed a significant upregulation in the HMGB3, HIF1\u03b1, and Reg1\u03b1 levels. Endothelial cells exposed to recombinant HMGB3 increased the tubule length. Further, the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was reduced with the acute induction of recombinant HMGB3 on cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts.\nHMGB3 plays a dual role during the progression of myocardial ischemia and infarction.

It results primarily by epigenetic silencing the FXN gene due to up to 1400 GAA triplet repeats in intron 1 of both alleles of the gene; a subset of approximately 3% of FRDA patients have a mutation on one allele. FRDA patients die most commonly in their 30s from heart disease. Therefore, increasing expression of heart hFXN-M using gene therapy offers a way to prevent early mortality in FRDA. We used rhesus macaque monkeys to test the pharmacology of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)hu68.CB7.hFXN therapy. The advantage of using non-human primates for hFXN-M gene therapy studies is that hFXN-M and monkey FXN-M (mFXN-M) are 98.5% identical, which limits potential immunologic side-effects. However, this presented a formidable bioanalytical challenge in quantification of proteins with almost identical sequences. This was overcome by development of a species-specific quantitative mass spectrometry-based method, which revealed for the first time, robust transgene-specific human protein expression in monkey heart tissue.

In conclusion, our results indicated that BrE modulated oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis to attenuate DOX-induced cardiac damage.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2023-07-15", "authors": ["LinyeZhang", "QihongJiang", "XiumingWang", "AmitJaisi", "Opeyemi JoshuaOlatunji"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-38560-5\n10.3390/molecules27072122\n10.1002/prp2.381\n10.1016/j.bcp.2014.01.040\n10.1093/cvr/cvs309\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109547\n10.1007/s00280-019-04019-6\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.06.022\n10.3390/ijms21207802\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.02.013\n10.1002/ptr.6882\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111708\n10.3390/ijms18010096\n10.1038/s41598-021-89437-4\n10.1155/2020/6940313\n10.1016/j.fbio.2021.101011\n10.2147/JPR.S359766\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.113193\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.111002\n10.31083/j.fbl2707206\n10.1155/2012/473637\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.07.011\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.113104\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112732\n10.1248/bpb.b21-00036\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.114568\n10.1007/s12012-018-9446-2\n10.1002/tox.23002\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.01.065\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112411\n10.1016/j.jtemb.2018.01.016\n10.1016/j.cca.2019.02.022\n10.1515/tjb-2018-0156\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.101\n10.1152/ajpheart.00253.2017\n10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109599\n10.1007/s00210-021-02132-z\n10.1016/j.jff.2019.103542\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000692\n10.1038/s41419-018-0727-2\n10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107533\n10.1021/acs.jafc.8b02607\n10.4014/jmb.1707.07042\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.12.021\n10.1038/ncb1730\n10.1016/j.bcp.2018.07.039\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113874\n10.1038/s41401-020-0397-3"}
{"title": "Evaluation of Porcine Psoas Major as a Scaffold Material for Engineered Heart Tissues.", "abstract": "Decellularized porcine myocardium is commonly used as scaffolding for engineered heart tissues (EHTs). However, structural and mechanical heterogeneity in the myocardium complicate production of mechanically consistent tissues. In this study, we evaluate the porcine psoas major muscle (tenderloin) as an alternative scaffold material. Head-to-head comparison of decellularized tenderloin and ventricular scaffolds showed only minor differences in mean biomechanical characteristics, but tenderloin scaffolds were less variable and less dependent on the region of origin than ventricular samples. The active contractile behavior of EHTs made by seeding tenderloin versus ventricular scaffolds with human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes was also comparable, with only minor differences observed. Collectively, the data reveal that the behavior of EHTs produced from decellularized porcine psoas muscle is almost identical to those made from porcine left ventricular myocardium, with the advantages of being more homogeneous, biomechanically consistent, and readily obtainable.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Stimuli-responsive hydrogels: smart state of-the-art platforms for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Biomedicine and tissue regeneration have made significant advancements recently, positively affecting the whole healthcare spectrum. This opened the way for them to develop their applications for revitalizing damaged tissues. Thus, their functionality will be restored. Cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) using curative procedures that combine biomolecules, biomimetic scaffolds, and cells plays a critical part in this path. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels (SRHs) are excellent three-dimensional (3D) biomaterials for tissue engineering (TE) and various biomedical applications. They can mimic the intrinsic tissues' physicochemical, mechanical, and biological characteristics in a variety of ways. They also provide for 3D setup, adequate aqueous conditions, and the mechanical consistency required for cell development. Furthermore, they function as competent delivery platforms for various biomolecules. Many natural and synthetic polymers were used to fabricate these intelligent platforms with innovative enhanced features and specialized capabilities that are appropriate for CTE applications. In the present review, different strategies employed for CTE were outlined. The light was shed on the limitations of the use of conventional hydrogels in CTE. Moreover, diverse types of SRHs, their characteristics, assembly and exploitation for CTE were discussed. To summarize, recent development in the construction of SRHs increases their potential to operate as intelligent, sophisticated systems in the reconstruction of degenerated cardiac tissues.",

{"title": "Three-Dimensionally Printed Hydrogel Cardiac Patch for Infarct Regeneration Based on Natural Polysaccharides.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is one of the more common cardiovascular diseases, and remains the leading cause of death, globally. Hydrogels (namely, those using natural polymers) provide a reliable tool for regenerative medicine and have become a promising option for cardiac tissue regeneration due to their hydrophilic character and their structural similarity to the extracellular matrix. Herein, a functional ink based on the natural polysaccharides Gellan gum and Konjac glucomannan has, for the first time, been applied in the production of a 3D printed hydrogel with therapeutic potential, with the goal of being locally implanted in the infarcted area of the heart. Overall, results revealed the excellent printability of the bioink for the development of a stable, porous, biocompatible, and bioactive 3D hydrogel, combining the specific advantages of Gellan gum and Konjac glucomannan with proper mechanical properties, which supports the simplification of the implantation process. In addition, the structure have positive effects on endothelial cells' proliferation and migration that can promote the repair of injured cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Copper and Zinc Particles as Regulators of Cardiovascular System Function-A Review.", "abstract": "Copper and zinc are micronutrients that play a crucial role in many cellular pathways, act as cofactors in enzymatic systems, and hence, modulate enzyme activity. The regulation of these elements in homeostasis is precisely controlled by various mechanisms. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme requiring both copper and zinc for proper functioning. Additionally, there is an interaction between the concentrations of copper and zinc. Dietary ingestion of large amounts of zinc augments intestinal absorption of this trace element, resulting in copper deficiency secondary to zinc excess. The presence of an overabundance of copper and zinc has a detrimental impact on the cardiovascular system; however, the impact on vascular contractility varies. Copper plays a role in the modulation of vascular remodeling in the cardiac tissue, and the phenomenon of cuproptosis has been linked to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. The presence of copper has an observable effect on the vasorelaxation mediated by nitric oxide. The maintenance of proper levels of zinc within an organism influences SOD and is essential in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Recently, the effects of metal nanoparticles have been investigated due to their unique characteristics. On the other hand, dietary introduction of metal nanoparticles may result in vascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cellular DNA damage. Copper and zinc intake affect cardiovascular function, but more research is needed.", "journal": "Nutrients", "date": "2023-07-14", "authors": ["KlaudiaKitala", "DamianTanski", "JanuszGodlewski", "MagdalenaKrajewska-W\u0142odarczyk", "LeszekGromadzi\u0144ski", "Micha\u0142Majewski"], "doi": "10.3390/nu15133040\n10.1007/978-3-319-74814-6_4\n10.1039/c8mt00277k\n10.2174/0929867326666190902122155\n10.1002/ncp.10328\n10.5601/jelem.2019.24.1.1813\n10.1016/j.bpg.2016.02.007\n10.1074/jbc.M110.143826\n10.1038/s41392-022-01229-y\n10.1007/s10534-014-9736-5\n10.1007/s12576-017-0571-7\n10.1007/s00204-020-02702-9\n10.2119/2008-00033.Prasad\n10.1024/0300-9831/a000030\n10.1093/jn/130.5.1378S\n10.1177/0884533615570376\n10.1371/journal.pone.0149516\n10.1017/erm.2014.11\n10.1038/s41419-023-05639-w\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.05.006\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113329\n10.3390/ijms24021667\n10.1159/000519906\n10.1155/2023/5996144\n10.1039/C6SC02267G\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.05.028\n10.1046/j.1525-1373.2000.22418.x\n10.1155/2018/9365747\n10.1007/s12011-019-01671-0\n10.3390/nu8110707\n10.1007/s10534-013-9671-x\n10.1124/jpet.107.119644\n10.3389/fnut.2021.686078\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03768\n10.1039/C9FO01034C\n10.1159/000354523\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0704816\n10.1111/j.0959-9673.2005.00432.x\n10.1016/j.taap.2020.114877\n10.1016/S0946-672X(03)80025-1\n10.1038/s41467-021-23198-6\n10.1177/1091581814532958\n10.3390/antiox11050910\n10.3390/nu13113793\n10.3390/nu14235138\n10.1002/tox.23688\n10.1371/journal.pone.0229282\n10.1016/j.pharep.2017.06.001\n10.3390/nu14051118\n10.1016/j.jff.2019.103595\n10.1016/j.mvr.2018.06.003\n10.2147/IJN.S241157\n10.3390/ijms232112940\n10.1016/j.jtemb.2017.04.013\n10.2147/IJN.S134897\n10.3390/ijms21103437\n10.1016/j.cbi.2016.08.013\n10.2147/IJN.S246797\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2015.04.003"}
{"title": "Conjugated Linoleic Acid-Mediated Connexin-43 Remodeling and Sudden Arrhythmic Death in Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Connexin 43 (Cx43) is expressed in the left and right ventricles and is primarily responsible for conducting physiological responses in microvasculature. Studies have demonstrated that NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes are essential in cardiac redox biology and are responsible for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NOX2 is linked to left ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). It was hypothesized that conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) treatment increases NOX-2 levels in heart tissue and disrupts connexins between the myocytes in the ventricle. Data herein demonstrate that cLA treatment significantly decreases survival in a murine model of MI. The observance of cLA-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia's (VT) led to the subsequent investigation of the underlying mechanism in this MI model. Mice were treated with cLA for 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h to determine possible time-dependent changes in NOX and Cx43 signaling pathways in isolated left ventricles (LV) extracted from cardiac tissue. The results suggest that ROS generation, through the stimulation of NOX2 in the LV, triggers a decrease in Cx43 levels, causing dysfunction of the gap junctions following treatment with cLA. This cascade of events may initiate VT and subsequent death during MI. Taken together, individuals at risk of MI should use caution regarding cLA consumption.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-07-14", "authors": ["Natia QipshidzeKelm", "Jane CSolinger", "Kellianne MPiell", "Marsha PCole"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms241311208\n10.1097/00041433-200206000-00005\n10.1194/jlr.M030924\n10.3382/ps.0721301\n10.1006/bbrc.1994.1157\n10.1016/j.plipres.2004.08.002\n10.1016/0021-9150(94)90034-5\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2005.08.024\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2011.12.006\n10.1006/bbrc.1998.8303\n10.1093/jn/133.1.257S\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.03.043\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.01.001\n10.3109/10253890.2014.979785\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000093820.81258.5F\n10.3109/15419060109080717\n10.1093/cvr/cvn133\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.05.014\n10.4161/chan.5.6.18523\n10.4149/gpb_2012_047\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.5.547\n10.1161/CIRCEP.112.976787\n10.1155/2013/271602\n10.1093/cvr/cvu050\n10.1152/physrev.00044.2005\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.101980\n10.1016/S1054-8807(03)00152-2\n10.1172/JCI119709\n10.1128/MCB.23.13.4598-4610.2003\n10.1021/jf8004977\n10.1021/jf100117a\n10.1155/2013/429393\n10.1161/01.RES.88.3.333\n10.1161/hc3601.093990\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.057224\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.013\n10.3390/ijms22158095\n10.3390/ijms222413216\n10.1111/jnc.13024\n10.1161/01.RES.0000183735.09871.61\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.007\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.09.002\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.07.012\n10.1016/j.exer.2013.02.002"}

Its production is stimulated in response to inflammation. The concentrations of NGAL can be measured in plasma, urine, and biological fluids such as peritoneal effluent. NGAL is known mainly as a biomarker of acute kidney injury and is released after tubular damage and during renal regeneration processes. NGAL is also elevated in chronic kidney disease and dialysis patients. It may play a role as a predictor of the progression of renal function decreases with complications and mortality due to kidney failure. NGAL is also useful in the diagnostic processes of cardiovascular diseases. It is highly expressed in injured heart tissue and atherosclerostic plaque; its serum concentrations correlate with the severity of heart failure and coronary artery disease. NGAL increases inflammatory states and its levels rise in arterial hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and metabolic complications such as insulin resistance, and is also involved in carcinogenesis.

{"title": "Human Stem Cells for Cardiac Disease Modeling and Preclinical and Clinical Applications-Are We on the Road to Success?", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are pointed out by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the leading cause of death, contributing to a significant and growing global health and economic burden. Despite advancements in clinical approaches, there is a critical need for innovative cardiovascular treatments to improve patient outcomes. Therapies based on adult stem cells (ASCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have emerged as promising strategies to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue and restore cardiac function. Moreover, the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells has opened new avenues for disease modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine applications, with fewer ethical concerns than those associated with ESCs. Herein, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the application of human pluripotent stem cells in CVD research and clinics. We describe the types and sources of stem cells that have been tested in preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of CVDs as well as the applications of pluripotent stem-cell-derived in vitro systems to mimic disease phenotypes. How human stem-cell-based in vitro systems can overcome the limitations of current toxicological studies is also discussed. Finally, the current state of clinical trials involving stem-cell-based approaches to treat CVDs are presented, and the strengths and weaknesses are critically discussed to assess whether researchers

{"title": "Patterned Arteriole-Scale Vessels Enhance Engraftment, Perfusion, and Vessel Branching Hierarchy of Engineered Human Myocardium for Heart Regeneration.", "abstract": "Heart regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI) using human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) is rapidly accelerating with large animal and human clinical trials. However, vascularization methods to support the engraftment, survival, and development of implanted CMs in the ischemic environment of the infarcted heart remain a key and timely challenge. To this end, we developed a dual remuscularization-revascularization therapy that is evaluated in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion MI. This study details the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) for engineering cardiac tissue containing patterned engineered vessels 400 \u03bcm in diameter. Vascularized engineered human myocardial tissues (vEHMs) are cultured in static conditions or perfused in vitro prior to implantation and evaluated after two weeks. Immunohistochemical staining indicates improved engraftment of hiPSC-CMs in in vitro-perfused vEHMs with greater expression of SMA+ vessels and evidence of inosculation. Three-dimensional vascular reconstructions reveal less tortuous and larger intra-implant vessels, as well as an improved branching hierarchy in in vitro-perfused vEHMs relative to non-perfused controls. Exploratory RNA sequencing of explanted vEHMs supports the hypothesis that co-revascularization impacts hiPSC-CM development in vivo. Our approach provides a strong foundation to enhance vEHM integration, develop hierarchical vascular perfusion, and maximize hiPSC-CM engraftment for future regenerative therapy.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2023-07-14", "authors": ["Rajeev JKant", "Kiera DDwyer", "Jang-HoonLee", "CollinPolucha", "MomokaKobayashi", "StephenPyon", "Arvin HSoepriatna", "JonghwanLee", "Kareen L KCoulombe"], "doi": "10.3390/cells12131698\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120033\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aad2304\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.01.017\n10.1073/pnas.0812242106\n10.1073/pnas.1017825108\n10.1002/term.2568\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aax2992\n10.1038/s41551-017-0083\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01133\n10.1038/s41596-021-00533-1\n10.1063/1.5122804\n10.1038/s41467-019-08388-7\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0214\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0252\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000202\n10.1371/journal.pone.0227780\n10.1088/0031-9155/61/21/7536\n10.1038/nprot.2015.119\n10.1038/s41467-019-10338-2\n10.1038/s44161-022-00114-9\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.05.022\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.053563\n10.1002/stem.2732\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047904\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1038/s41467-021-23816-3\n10.3390/bioengineering10050587\n10.1242/dmm.049834\n10.1093/stcltm/szac061\n10.1038/s41467-021-23329-z\n10.3390/jpm11050374\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.1002/adma.201606061\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.10.005\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1371/journal.pone.0230001\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.06.001\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0068\n10.1155/2020/9363809\n10.1089/ten.tea.2020.0269\n10.1089/ten.tec.2018.0379\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1002/adhm.201700202\n10.1016/j.vph.2008.01.002\n10.1007/s10439-016-1762-8\n10.1093/nar/gky379\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.06720.x\n10.1586/erc.10.28\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121286\n10.1002/adhm.202000782\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0133\n10.1093/stcltm/szab002\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.02.007\n10.1101/gad.1319405\n10.1155/2017/7648409\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131446\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1038/s41598-022-23895-2\n10.3389/fphys.2020.591450\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0311\n10.1073/pnas.1814238116\n10.1002/adma.202102661\n10.1073/pnas.1217796110\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b01624\n10.1016/j.msec.2021.112178\n10.1039/D2BM01200F\n10.1364/OE.20.022262\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01401\n10.1002/bit.27836\n10.1073/pnas.1722594115\n10.1242/dev.200654\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028252\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045115\n10.1038/s41467-020-16204-w\n10.1016/j.stem.2023.04.010\n10.1186/s12859-018-2353-5"}
{"title": "Macrophage DCLK1 promotes obesity-induced cardiomyopathy via activating RIP2/TAK1 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Obesity increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases and induces cardiomyopathy. Chronic inflammation plays a significant role in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy and may provide new therapeutic targets for this disease. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is an important target for cancer therapy and the role of DCLK1 in obesity and cardiovascular diseases is unclear. Herein, we showed that DCLK1 was overexpressed in the cardiac tissue of obese mice and investigated the role of DCLK1 in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. We generated DCLK1-deleted mice and showed that macrophage-specific DCLK1 knockout, rather than cardiomyocyte-specific DCLK1 knockout, prevented high-fat diet (HFD)-induced heart dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. RNA sequencing analysis showed that DCLK1 deficiency exerted cardioprotective effects by suppressing RIP2/TAK1 activation and inflammatory responses in macrophages. Upon HFD/palmitate (PA) challenge, macrophage DCLK1 mediates RIP2/TAK1 phosphorylation and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release, which further promotes hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes and fibrogenesis in fibroblasts. Finally, a pharmacological inhibitor of DCLK1 significantly protects hearts in HFD-fed mice. Our study demonstrates a novel role and a pro-inflammatory mechanism of macrophage DCLK1 in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy and identifies DCLK1 as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease. Upon HFD/PA challenge, DCLK1 induces RIP2/TAK1-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages, which subsequently promotes cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Macrophage-specific DCLK1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of DCLK1 protects hearts in HFD-fed mice.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2023-07-14", "authors": ["BinYang", "YunjieZhao", "WuLuo", "WeiweiZhu", "LeimingJin", "MinxiuWang", "LinYe", "YiWang", "GuangLiang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41419-023-05960-4\n10.1038/s41569-020-00465-5\n10.1038/s41571-022-00672-8\n10.1016/j.cell.2022.08.005\n10.1016/j.metabol.2021.154892\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318159\n10.1038/s41569-022-00718-5\n10.1016/j.metabol.2018.10.011\n10.1152/physrev.00030.2020\n10.1093/cvr/cvx012\n10.1172/JCI139576\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.312321\n10.1038/s41569-018-0007-y\n10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154194\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.053365\n10.1084/jem.20111790\n10.1016/j.ccell.2016.11.005\n10.1053/j.gastro.2019.08.018\n10.1186/1476-4598-13-103\n10.1038/s41418-018-0237-x\n10.18632/oncotarget.3972\n10.1038/s41467-020-15978-3\n10.1038/s41392-021-00542-2\n10.2337/db13-1577\n10.2147/DDDT.S195412\n10.1038/s41569-018-0086-9\n10.1038/s41589-020-0506-0\n10.1016/j.abb.2019.02.008\n10.1038/nm.3806\n10.1038/s41401-020-00603-2\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112417\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034621\n10.1016/j.canlet.2022.01.014\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106392\n10.1016/j.brainres.2017.09.034\n10.1038/s41586-019-0904-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043053\n10.1038/s41420-021-00526-9\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1076-19.2019\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0471\n10.1016/j.jhep.2021.12.012\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.015\n10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154404\n10.1016/j.metabol.2018.01.013\n10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154393\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041213\n10.1159/000356618\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154238\n10.3389/fgene.2021.650213\n10.3892/ijo.2022.5427\n10.1016/j.canlet.2022.01.030\n10.3389/fphar.2021.650403\n10.1038/s41467-018-06451-3\n10.1093/intimm/dxz045\n10.1101/cshperspect.a035154\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.039357"}

{"title": "Tissue characterization of benign cardiac tumors by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, a review of core imaging protocol and benign cardiac tumors.", "abstract": "Generally, cardiac masses are initially suspected on routine echocardiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is further performed to differentiate tumors from pseudo-tumors and to characterize the cardiac masses based on their appearance on T1/T2-weighted images, detection of perfusion and demonstration of gadolinium-based contrast agent uptake on early and late gadolinium enhancement images. Further evaluation of cardiac masses by CMR is critical because unnecessary surgery can be avoided by better tissue characterization. Different cardiac tissues have different T1 and T2 relaxation times, principally owing to different internal biochemical environments surrounding the protons. In CMR, the signal intensity from a particular tissue depends on its T1 and T2 relaxation times and its proton density. CMR uses this principle to differentiate between various tissue types by weighting images based on their T1 or T2 relaxation times. Generally, tumor cells are larger, edematous, and have associated inflammatory reactions. Higher free water content of the neoplastic cells and other changes in tissue composition lead to prolonged T1/T2 relaxation times and thus an inherent contrast between tumors and normal tissue exists. Overall, these biochemical changes create an environment where different cardiac masses produce different signal intensity on their T1- weighted and T2- weighted images that help to discriminate between them. In this review article, we have provided a detailed description of the core CMR imaging protocol for evaluation of cardiac masses. We have also discussed the basic features of benign cardiac tumors as well as the role of CMR in evaluation and further tissue characterization of these tumors.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2023-07-13", "authors": ["ImranHaider", "HameedUllah", "MishaimFatima", "Muhammad SikandarKarim", "Furqan UlHaq", "AbdulMajid", "Muhammad SaadAnwar", "Fatima KausarNawaz", "IjazAli", "Atif HussainSarwar", "Muhammad TayyabAnwar", "Abdul WaliKhan", "OmamaHumayun", "FazalAlam"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2023.1009411\n10.1148/rg.255045721\n10.1136/hrt.2009.186320\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.783126\n10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00587-0\n10.1016/S1470-2045(05)70093-0\n10.3941/jrcr.v3i9.210\n10.1148/radiographics.20.5.g00se121303\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.05.034\n10.2214/AJR.08.1895\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.189695\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.050\n10.1186/1745-6215-9-68\n10.1097/01.RLI.0000064784.68316.34\n10.1007/BF01772011\n10.1186/1532-429X-10-35\n10.2214/ajr.149.4.831\n10.1148/radiology.199.1.8633172\n10.1056/NEJM200011163432003\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.05.009\n10.1067/j.cpradiol.2004.10.002\n10.1148/radiographics.20.4.g00jl081073\n10.1148/radiographics.22.3.g02ma02673\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.783126\n10.1046/j.1365-2559.1999.00636.x\n10.1007/s00330-004-2603-y\n10.1097/00005382-200010000-00006\n10.1177/000331979604700709\n10.1016/S1010-7940(97)00246-7\n10.1016/0730-725X(90)90021-S\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.589630\n10.1378/chest.124.6.2068\n10.1097/00000433-199509000-00002\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2007.07.012\n10.1016/S0002-8703(03)00249-7\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.22.2687\n10.1111/j.1540-8191.2010.01042.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.729731\n10.1016/S0002-8703(97)70032-2\n10.1016/S1010-7940(01)00951-4\n10.1007/s00246-012-0399-0\n10.1016/S0003-4975(03)01196-2\n10.1007/s00059-005-2667-8\n10.1007/s00059-005-2667-8\n10.1016/S0002-9149(03)00911-1\n10.1016/0146-2806(79)90008-2\n10.7759/cureus.24622\n10.1097/00005382-200307000-00012\n10.1016/S0002-9149(02)02314-7\n10.1186/1477-7819-11-125\n10.1007/s00330-004-2412-3\n10.1056/NEJM199512143332407\n10.1007/s003300051023"}

Herein, we used a laser direct infrared chemical imaging system and scanning electron microscopy to investigate whether microplastics exist in the human heart and its surrounding tissues. Microplastic specimens were collected from 15 cardiac surgery patients, including 6 pericardia, 6 epicardial adipose tissues, 11 pericardial adipose tissues, 3 myocardia, 5 left atrial appendages, and 7 pairs of pre- and postoperative venous blood samples. Microplastics were not universally present in all tissue samples, but nine types were found across five types of tissue with the largest measuring 469 \u03bcm in diameter. Nine types of microplastics were also detected in pre- and postoperative blood samples with a maximum diameter of 184 \u03bcm, and the type and diameter distribution of microplastics in the blood showed alterations following the surgical procedure. Moreover, the presence of poly(methyl methacrylate) in the left atrial appendage, epicardial adipose tissue, and pericardial adipose tissue cannot be attributed to accidental exposure during surgery, providing direct evidence of microplastics in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

The cardiac function of mice was determined, and heart tissue and ultrastructural changes were observed. Apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected, and MitoTracker\u2122 staining was performed to observe cardiomyocyte mitochondria. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and cellular immunofluorescence were also performed.\nIn the short-term CIH group, increases in mouse ejection fraction (EF) and heart rate (HR); mitochondrial division; ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential; and the expression levels of CB1R, AMPK, and PGC-1\u03b1 were observed in vivo and in vitro. In the long-term CIH group, the EF and HR increased, the myocardial injury and mitochondrial damage were more severe, mitochondrial synthesis decreased, the apoptosis percentage and ROS increased, mitochondrial fragmentation increased, membrane potential decreased, CB1R expression increased, and AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1 expression levels decreased. Targeted blocking of CB1R can increase AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1, reduce damage attributed to long-term CIH in mouse hearts and H9C2 cells, and promote mitochondrial synthesis.\nShort-term CIH can directly activate the AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway, promote mitochondrial synthesis in cardiomyocytes, and protect cardiac structure and function. Long-term CIH can increase CB1R expression and inhibit the AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway, resulting in structural damage, the disturbance of myocardial mitochondria synthesis, and further alterations in the cardiac structure.

{"title": "PDGF-AB Reduces Myofibroblast Differentiation Without Increasing Proliferation After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "After myocardial infarction (MI), fibroblasts progress from proliferative to myofibroblast states, resulting in fibrosis. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are reported to induce fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and fibrosis. However, we have previously shown that PDGFs improve heart function post-MI without increasing fibrosis. We treated human cardiac fibroblasts with PDGF isoforms then performed RNA sequencing to show that PDGFs reduced cardiac fibroblasts myofibroblast differentiation and downregulated cell cycle pathways. Using mouse/pig MI models, we reveal that PDGF-AB infusion increases cell-cell interactions, reduces myofibroblast differentiation, does not affect proliferation, and accelerates scar formation. RNA sequencing of pig hearts after MI showed that PDGF-AB reduces inflammatory cytokines and alters both transcript variants and long noncoding RNA expression in cell cycle pathways.

{"title": "Cisplatin cycles treatment sustains cardiovascular and renal damage involving TLR4 and NLRP3 pathways.", "abstract": "Cisplatin is clinically proven to combat different cancers, including sarcomas, soft tissue cancers, bones, muscles, and blood. However, renal and cardiovascular toxicities are important limitations in cisplatin therapeutical use. Immunoinflammation could be key factor in cisplatin-induced toxicity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activation of the inflammatory TLR4/NLRP3 pathway as a common mechanism for cardiovascular and renal cisplatin's cycles treatment toxicity. Adult male Wistar rats were treated with saline, cisplatin 2\u2009mg/kg or cisplatin 3\u2009mg/kg (intraperitoneally once a week, for five experimental weeks). After treatments, plasma, cardiac, vascular, and renal tissues were collected. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and inflammatory cytokines were determined. TLR4, MyD88, NF-\u03ba\u03b2 p65, NLRP3, and procaspase-1 tissue expressions were also analyzed. Cisplatin treatment induced a dose-dependent increase in plasma MDA and IL-18. In cardiovascular system, an increase in NLRP3 and in cleaved caspase-1 were observed in cardiac tissue and a moderate increase in TLR4, MyD88 appeared in mesenteric artery. In kidney, a significant dose-dependent increase in TLR4, MyD88 and NLRP3 and cleaved caspase 1 expressions were observed after cisplatin treatments. In conclusion, cisplatin cycles provoke a low grade pro-inflammatory systemic state. Kidney was more sensitive than cardiovascular tissues to this pro-inflammatory state.

{"title": "Sandwich-like electro-conductive polyurethane-based gelatin/soybean oil nanofibrous scaffolds with a targeted release of simvastatin for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) is a promising way for the restoration of injured cardiac tissue in the healthcare system. The development of biodegradable scaffolds with appropriate chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological properties is an unmet need for the success of CTE. Electrospinning is a versatile technique that has shown potential applications in CTE. Herein, four different types of multifunctional scaffolds, including synthetic-based poly (glycerol sebacate)-polyurethane (PGU), PGU-Soy scaffold, and a series of trilayer scaffolds containing two outer layers of PGU-Soy and a middle (inner) layer of gelatin (G) as a natural and biodegradable macromolecule without simvastatin (S) and with simvastatin (GS), an anti-inflammatory agent, were fabricated in the sandwich-like structure using electrospinning technique. This approach offers a combination of the advantages of both synthetic and natural polymers to enhance the bioactivity and the cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix intercommunication. An in vitro drug release analysis was performed after the incorporation of soybean oil (Soy) and G. Soy is used as a semiconducting material was introduced to improve the electrical conductivity of nanofibrous scaffolds. The physicochemical properties, contact angle, and biodegradability of the electrospun scaffolds were also assessed. Moreover, the blood compatibility of nanofibrous scaffolds was studied through activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and hemolytic assay. The results showed that all scaffolds exhibited defect-free morphologies with mean fiber diameters in the range of 361\u2009\u00b1\u2009109 to 417\u2009\u00b1\u2009167\u00a0nm. A delay in blood clotting was observed, demonstrating the anticoagulant nature of nanofibrous scaffolds.

Lung cancer has the highest incidence and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction constitutes a major cause of death in lung cancer patients.

Here, we established a novel chemically induced lung cancer mouse model using benzo[a]pyrene and urethane to recapitulate the general characteristics of cardiac dysfunction caused by lung cancer, the cardiac disorders in the context of the progression of lung cancer were evaluated using echocardiographic and histological approaches. The pathological changes included myocardial ischaemia, pericarditis, cardiac pre-cachexia, and pulmonary artery hypertension. We performed sequencing to detect the tRNA-derived fragments and tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tRFs/tiRNAs) expressions in mouse heart tissue. 22 upregulated and 16 downregulated tRFs/tiRNAs were identified. Subsequently, the top 10 significant results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were presented. The in vitro model was established by exposing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and myocardial fibroblasts to lung tumour cell-conditioned medium, respectively. Western blotting revealed significant changes in cardiac failure markers (atrial natriuretic peptide and \u03b1-myosin heavy chain) and cardiac fibrosis markers (Collagen-1 and Collagen-3).

Understanding the relation between the time-dependent changes in material properties of the myocardium and the contractile function of the heart may further our understanding of the development of HF post-MI and guide the development of novel therapies. A finite element model of cardiac mechanics was used to model MI in a thick-walled truncated ellipsoidal geometry. Infarct core and border zone comprised 9.6 and 8.1% of the LV wall volume, respectively. Acute MI was modeled by inhibiting active stress generation. Chronic MI was modeled by the additional effect of infarct material stiffening, wall thinning and fiber reorientation. In acute MI, stroke work decreased by 25%. In the infarct core, fiber stress was reduced but fiber strain was increased, depending on the degree of infarct stiffening. Fiber work density was equal to zero. Healthy tissue adjacent to the infarct showed decreased work density depending on the degree of infarct stiffness and the orientation of the myofibers with respect to the infarct region. Thinning of the wall partially restored this loss in work density while the effects of fiber reorientation were minimal. We found that the relative loss in pump function in the infarcted heart exceeds the relative loss in healthy myocardial tissue due to impaired mechanical function in healthy tissue adjacent to the infarct.

Although cAMP signaling has been extensively studied in cardiac cells and animal models of heart failure (HF), not much is known about its actual amount present inside human failing or non-failing cardiomyocytes. Since many drugs used in HF work via cAMP, it is crucial to determine the status of its intracellular levels in failing vs. normal human hearts.\nOnly studies performed on explanted/excised cardiac tissues from patients were examined. Studies that contained no data from human hearts or no data on cAMP levels per se were excluded from this perspective's analysis.\nCurrently, there is no consensus on the status of cAMP levels in human failing vs. non-failing hearts. Several studies on animal models may suggest maladaptive (e.g. pro-apoptotic) effects of cAMP on HF, advocating for cAMP lowering for therapy, but human studies almost universally indicate that myocardial cAMP levels are deficient in human failing hearts. It is the expert opinion of this perspective that intracellular cAMP levels are too low in human failing hearts, contributing to the disease.

In the present study, we explore whether the aspartate-glutamate carrier1 (AGC1) interacts with the fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and reveal the functional and molecular mechanisms contributing to DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Results of co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (CO-IP MS) analysis based on heart tissue of DCM patients revealed that AGC1 expression was significantly upregulated in DCM-induced injury and AGC1 level was closely correlated with mitochondrial morphogenesis and function. We showed that AGC1 knockdown protected mice from DOX-induced cardiomyopathy by preventing mitochondrial fission, while the overexpression of AGC1 in the mouse heart led to impairment of cardiac function. Mechanistically, AGC1 overexpression could upregulate Drp1 expression and contribute to subsequent excessive mitochondrial fission. Specifically, AGC1 knockdown or the use of Drp1-specific inhibitor Mdivi-1 alleviated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inhibited impairment of mitochondrial function induced by DOX exposure. In summary, our data illustrate that AGC1, as a novel contributor to DCM, regulates cardiac function via Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, indicating that targeting AGC1-Drp1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine", "date": "2023-07-05", "authors": ["YanXia", "JiayuJin", "AoChen", "DanboLu", "XinyuChe", "JiaqiMa", "SuLi", "MingYin", "ZhengYang", "HaoLu", "ChenguangLi", "JinxiangChen", "MuyinLiu", "YuanWu", "HuiGong", "YunzengZou", "ZhangweiChen", "JuyingQian", "JunboGe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.trsl.2023.06.004"}

{"title": "Vinpocetine protects against chloroquine-induced cardiotoxicity by mitigating oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are classical antimalarial drugs, and recently have been used for other applications including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although they are considered safe, cardiomyopathy may associate CQ and HCQ applications particularly at overdoses. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the potential protective effect of the nootropic agent vinpocetine against CQ and HCQ adverse effects with a specific focus on the heart. For this purpose, a mouse model of CQ (0.5 up to 2.5\u00a0g/kg)/HCQ (1 up to 2\u00a0g/kg) toxicity was used, and the effect of vinpocetine was evaluated by survival, biochemical, as well as histopathological analyses. Survival analysis revealed that CQ and HCQ caused dose-dependent lethality, which was prevented by co-treatment with vinpocetine (100\u00a0mg/kg, oral or intraperitoneal). To gain deeper understanding, a dose of 1\u00a0g/kg CQ-which did not cause death within the first 24\u00a0h after administration-was applied with and without vinpocetine administration (100\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The CQ vehicle group showed marked cardiotoxicity as evidenced by significant alterations of blood biomarkers including troponione-1, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), ferritin, and potassium levels. This was confirmed at the tissue level by massive alteration of the heart tissue morphology and coincided with massive oxidative stress. Interestingly, co-administration of vinpocetine strongly ameliorated CQ-induced alterations and restored the antioxidant-defense system of the heart. These data suggest that vinpocetine could be used as an adjuvant therapy together with CQ/HCQ applications.", "journal": "Archives of toxicology", "date": "2023-07-04", "authors": ["NohaAbdelmageed", "Wael Ahmed-AnwarTwafik", "Osama Abdel-RaoufMorad", "MohieHaridy", "RehamHassan", "MadehaAhmed", "Hesham YoussefEl-Zorba", "Hossny AwadEl-Banna", "Abdel-LatiefSeddek", "AhmedGhallab", "Samy Abdel-Raouf FahimMorad"], "doi": "10.1007/s00204-023-03546-9\n10.1007/978-1-4939-0597-3_2\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.005\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.008\n10.1073/pnas.0914414107\n10.1177/2048872612471215\n10.1161/jaha.120.016887\n10.3390/antiox9090894\n10.1155/2013/141734\n10.1155/2019/6481812\n10.26355/eurrev_202004_21038\n10.1007/s12028-022-01499-y\n10.1007/s40261-018-0656-y\n10.5935/abc.20180248\n10.1001/jama.2020.8630\n10.1016/j.cbi.2015.05.007\n10.1161/CIRCEP.120.008662\n10.1111/1756-185X.13842\n10.1016/j.neulet.2014.02.045\n10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0\n10.1093/jac/dkg319\n10.3390/molecules20010335\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.11.041"}

Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been showed to play important roles in various diseases; however, its role in SIMD is unclear.

We found that the expression of a novel lncRNA, we named lncRNA-AABR07066529.3, was elevated in LPS-induced rat heart tissue and H9c2 cardiomyocytes. In addition, LPS-induced inflammation, apoptosis, and pyroptosis were significantly exacerbated after lncRNA-AABR07066529.3 knockdown. Moreover, we found that myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) was upregulated in LPS-treated groups and was inhibited by lncRNA-AABR07066529.3. Besides, MyD88 knockdown abolished lncRNA-AABR07066529.3 silencing effects on inflammation, apoptosis, and pyroptosis induced by LPS in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.

While fresh muscle tissue works best for these kinds of studies, this is not always practical to obtain, especially for heart tissue from large animal models and humans. Conversely, tissue banks of frozen human hearts are available and could be a tremendous resource for translational research. It is not well understood, however, how liquid nitrogen freezing and cryostorage may impact the structural integrity of myocardium from large mammals. In this study, we directly compared the structural and functional integrity of never-frozen to previously frozen porcine myocardium to investigate the consequences of freezing and cryostorage. X-ray diffraction measurements from hydrated tissue under near-physiological conditions and electron microscope images from chemically fixed porcine myocardium showed that prior freezing has only minor effects on structural integrity of the muscle. Furthermore, mechanical studies similarly showed no significant differences in contractile capabilities of porcine myocardium with and without freezing and cryostorage.

{"title": "Predicting Ventricular Tachycardia Circuits in Patients with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy using Genotype-specific Heart Digital Twins.", "abstract": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetic cardiac disease that leads to ventricular tachycardia (VT), a life-threatening heart rhythm disorder. Treating ARVC remains challenging due to the complex underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms, which involve structural and electrophysiological (EP) remodeling.

The heterogeneity, dynamic nature, and low abundance of protein complexes in their native states present tremendous challenges to study using conventional structural biology techniques. Here we develop a \"native nanoproteomics\" strategy for the native enrichment and subsequent native top-down mass spectrometry (nTDMS) of low-abundance protein complexes. Specifically, we demonstrate the first comprehensive characterization of the structure and dynamics of cardiac troponin (cTn) complexes directly from human heart tissue. The endogenous cTn complex is effectively enriched and purified using peptide-functionalized superparamagnetic nanoparticles under non-denaturing conditions to enable the isotopic resolution of cTn complexes, revealing their complex structure and assembly. Moreover, nTDMS elucidates the stoichiometry and composition of the heterotrimeric cTn complex, localizes Ca2+ binding domains (II-IV), defines cTn-Ca2+ binding dynamics, and provides high-resolution mapping of the proteoform landscape.

Currently, the pathophysiology of cardiac damage in sepsis is still unknown, and treatment approaches are limited.\nThe sepsis mouse model was established inducing by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo and Tectorigenin was pretreated to explore whether it contributed to alleviated myocardial injury. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain was employed to evaluate the myocardial injury severity. TUNEL assay measured the number of apoptosis cells and the levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 associated X (Bax) and Cleaved Caspase-3 were assessed by western blot. The contents of iron and related ferroptosis molecules (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family (ACSL4), Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4)) were assessed. Then, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-18, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and other inflammatory-related cytokines were detected by ELISA. The expression of the mother against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) in heart tissues was evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence.\nTectorigenin alleviated myocardial dysfunction and myofibrillar disruption in LPS-related sepsis groups. Tectorigenin ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial ferroptosis in LPS-stimulated sepsis mice. Tectorigenin reduced inflammatory-relevant cytokines in the cardiac tissues of LPS stimuli mice. In addition, we further confirm that Tectorigenin relieved myocardial ferroptosis by inhibiting the expression of Smad3.\nTectorigenin ameliorates myocardial damage stimulated by LPS and this effect exerts by inhibiting ferroptosis and the inflammation of the myocardium.

Nevertheless, the pathophysiology underlying doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and the respective molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested involvement of cellular senescence.\nThe aims of this study were to establish whether senescence is present in patients with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and to investigate if this could be used as a potential treatment target.\nBiopsies from the left ventricles of patients with severe doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity were compared with control samples. Additionally, senescence-associated mechanisms were characterized in 3-dimensional dynamic engineered heart tissues (dyn-EHTs) and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. These were exposed to multiple, clinically relevant doses of doxorubicin to recapitulate patient treatment regimens. To prevent senescence, dyn-EHTs were cotreated with the senomorphic drugs 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide and resveratrol.\nSenescence-related markers were significantly up-regulated in the left ventricles of patients with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Treatment of dyn-EHTs resulted in up-regulation of similar senescence markers as seen in the patients, accompanied by tissue dilatation, decreased force generation, and increased troponin release. Treatment with senomorphic drugs led to decreased expression of senescence-associated markers, but this was not accompanied by improved function.\nSenescence was observed in the hearts of patients with severe doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and this phenotype can be modeled in\u00a0vitro by exposing dyn-EHTs to repeated clinically relevant doses of doxorubicin. The senomorphic drugs 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide and resveratrol prevent senescence but do not result in functional improvements.

DAMPs like cytokines, chemokines, and nuclear or mitochondrial genomic fragments are released in the pathological myocardium. Interestingly, circulating or cytosolic DNA fragments can play a role in the disease by interaction with nucleic acid sensors expressed in cardiomyocyte and non-myocyte neighbouring cells. The circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) fragments have been clinically reported as markers for various diseases including cardiovascular pathophysiology. Such cfDNA within the DAMP pool can mediate intra- and inter-cellular signalling cascade to upregulate transcriptional expression of inflammatory mediators and trigger oxidative stress within cells. The cellular role of such genomic equivalents varying with chronic or acute stress might be correlated with the cell death forms encountered in myocardium during disease progression. Thus, cfDNA can be phenotypically correlated as a critical player towards upregulation of pathological processes like interstitial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction and cell death.

The role of the assembly factor evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in the toll (ECSIT) pathway was studied across various murine tissues to determine its role in this process and how this varied between tissues of varying energetic demands. We hypothesized that many of the known functions of ECSIT were unhindered by the introduction of an ENU-induced mutation, while its role in Complex I assembly was affected on a tissue-specific basis.\nHere, we describe a mutation in the MCIA factor ECSIT that reveals tissue-specific requirements for ECSIT in Complex I assembly. MCIA is a multi-step process dependent on assembly factors that organize and arrange the individual subunits, allowing for their incorporation into the complete enzyme complex. We have identified an ENU-induced mutation in ECSIT (N209I) that exhibits a profound effect on Complex I component expression and assembly in heart tissue, resulting in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the absence of other phenotypes. The dysfunction of Complex I appears to be cardiac specific, leading to a loss of mitochondrial output as measured by Seahorse extracellular flux and various biochemical assays in heart tissue, while mitochondria from other tissues were unaffected.\nThese data suggest that the mechanisms underlying Complex I assembly and activity may have tissue-specific elements tailored to the specific demands of cells and tissues. Our data suggest that tissues with high-energy demands, such as the heart, may utilize assembly factors in different ways to low-energy tissues in order to improve mitochondrial output.

Currently, research is focused on heart tissue regeneration by reprogramming diverse cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Here, we examined the possible effect of miRNAs on the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells.\nFirst heart-specific miRNAs were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of heart tissue to other body tissues using bioinformatic techniques. After identifying heart-specific miRNAs, their cellular and molecular functions were studied using the miRWalk and miRBase databases. Then the candidate miRNA was cloned into a lentiviral vector. Following, human dermal fibroblasts were cultured and treated with compounds forskolin, valproic acid, and CHIR99021. After 24\u00a0h, the lentivector harboring miRNA gene was transfected into the cells to initiate the transdifferentiation process. Finally, after a two-week treatment period, the efficiency of transdifferentiation was examined by inspecting the appearance of the cells and measuring the expression levels of cardiac genes and proteins using RT-qPCR and immunocytochemistry techniques.\nNine miRNAs were identified with higher expression in the heart. The miR-2392 was nominated as the candidate miRNA due to its function and specific expression in the heart. This miRNA has a direct connection with genes involved in cell growth and differentiation; e.g., MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways. According to in vitro results cardiac genes and proteins demonstrated an increase in expression in the fibroblasts that simultaneously received the three chemicals and miR-2392.\nConsidering the ability of miR-2392 to induce the expression of cardiac genes and proteins in fibroblast cells, it can induce fibroblasts to differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells.

Its role in ischemic heart disease has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated its effect on oxidative status and cell survival in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). We found that virus-induced down-regulation of Hrd1 expression limited infarct size, decreased creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and preserved cardiac function in mice subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and reperfusion. Silencing of the Hrd1 gene also prevented the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced (i) increase in dihydroethidium (DHE) intensity, mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO), (ii) decrease in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and glutathione (GSH), (iii) disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and (iv) increase in the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in ischemic heart tissue. In addition, down-regulation of Hrd1 expression prevented the abnormally increased caspase-3/caspase-9/Bax expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression in ischemic heart tissue of I/R mice. Further analysis showed that the I/R stimulus reduced peroxisome proliferation activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) expression in ischemic heart tissue, which was partially prevented by down-regulation of Hrd1. Pharmacological inhibition of PPAR\u03b1 was able to abolish the preventive effect of down-regulation of Hrd1 on oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and cellular apoptosis in ischemic heart tissue.

Its morphology is characterized by mitochondrial atrophy, increased mitochondrial membrane density, mitochondrial cristae degeneration and rupture, and unchanged nuclear morphology. Here, we investigated whether a bioactive constituent extracted from the Chinese herb Leonurus japonicus Houtt. (Yimucao), stachydrine, could improve cardiac function by inhibiting myocardial ferroptosis. We found significant morphological features of ferroptosis in a TAC-induced mouse model of heart failure, in which increased lipid peroxidation in cardiac tissue was accompanied by abnormalities in cystine metabolism as well as iron metabolism. The contractile function of adult mouse cardiomyocytes was severely reduced after the occurrence of erastin-induced ferroptosis. We found that in heart failure mice and erastin-induced cardiomyocyte ferroptosis models, stachydrine significantly improved myocardial function, improving mitochondrial morphological features of ferroptosis and associated signaling pathway alterations, including lipid peroxidation levels, cystine metabolism, and iron metabolism.

{"title": "Metabolic changes of glycerophospholipids during the reparative phase after myocardial infarction injury.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a fatal manifestation of coronary heart disease, and its underlying mechanism is still largely unknown. Lipid levels and composition alterations predict the risk of MI complications. Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) are important bioactive lipids and play a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the metabolic changes in the GPLs profile during post-MI injury remain unknown.\nIn the current study, we constructed a classic MI model by ligating the left anterior descending branch and assessed the alterations in both plasma and myocardial GPLs profiles during the reparative phase post-MI by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.\nWe found that myocardial GPLs, but not plasma GPLs, were markedly changed after MI injury. Importantly, MI injury is associated with decreased phosphatidylserine (PS) levels. Consistently, the expression of phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS1), which catalyzes the formation of PS from its substrate phosphatidylcholine, was significantly reduced in heart tissues after MI injury. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) inhibited PSS1 expression and reduced PS levels in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, while overexpression of PSS1 restored the inhibition of PSS1 and the reduction in PS levels caused by OGD. Moreover, overexpression of PSS1 abrogated, whereas knockdown of PSS1 aggravated, OGD-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\nOur findings revealed that GPLs metabolism was involved in the reparative phase post-MI, and cardiac decreased PS levels, resulting from inhibition of PSS1, are important contributor to the reparative phase post-MI.

However, TRE's protective effects against myocardial I/R injury remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of TRE pre-treatment in mice with acute myocardial I/R injury and to explore the role of pyroptosis in this process.

Cafestol (Caf) is a naturally occurring diterpene in unfiltered coffee with unique antioxidant, antimutagenic, and anti-inflammatory activities by activating the Nrf2 pathway. The present study aimed to investigate the potential chemoprotective effect of cafestol on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Wistar albino rats of both sexes were administered cafestol (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 14 consecutive days by oral gavage alone or with doxorubicin which was injected as a single dose (15\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally at day 14) to induce toxicity. The result showed that Caf significantly improved cardiac injury induced by doxorubicin, decreased serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, ALP, and ALT, and improved histopathological changes. In addition, cafestol significantly inhibited DOX-induced cardiac oxidative stress as seen in the reduced level of MDA and increased GSH, SOD, CAT, and Gpx-1 cardiac tissue levels; cafestol significantly enhanced Nrf2 gene and protein expression and promoted the expression of downstream antioxidant genes HO-1 and NQO-1 and downregulated Keap1 and NF-\u03baB genes' expression; in addition, Caf significantly reduced inflammatory mediators, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 levels and inhibited cardiac apoptosis by modulating Bax and Casp 3 tissue levels and reduced TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes.

The ability to fine-tune mechanical properties such as stiffness and the versatility of biomaterials is assessed, alongside applications of hydrogels with iPSC-CMs. Natural hydrogels often display higher biocompatibility with iPSC-CMs but often degrade quicker, whereas synthetic hydrogels can be modified to facilitate cell attachment and decrease degradation rates. iPSC-CM structure and electrophysiology can be assessed on natural and synthetic hydrogels, often resolving issues such as immaturity of iPSC-CMs. Biomaterial hydrogels can thus provide a more physiological model of the cardiac extracellular matrix compared to traditional 2D models, with the cardiac field expansively utilising hydrogels to recapitulate disease conditions such as stiffness, encourage alignment of iPSC-CMs and facilitate further model development such as engineered heart tissues (EHTs).", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-06-28", "authors": ["LeenaPatel", "Joshua CWorch", "Andrew PDove", "KatjaGehmlich"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24129995\n10.3389/fendo.2020.00280\n10.1172/JCI87491\n10.1007/s11357-017-9959-9\n10.12965/jer.130049\n10.1177/1535370218761628\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00178\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1152/ajpheart.00387.2003\n10.1038/s41578-020-0199-8\n10.3390/coatings10100925\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.554597\n10.1007/s10856-019-6318-7\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00340-5\n10.3390/molecules25071539\n10.3390/polym12112702\n10.1093/rb/rbab060\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.03.007\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.09.003\n10.1002/jbm.b.31386\n10.1002/adma.201003963\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124463\n10.1002/asia.201100440\n10.1021/cm101391y\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00665\n10.1039/C5SM00695C\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.07.034\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00305\n10.1007/s13770-018-0146-6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.044\n10.1586/erd.11.27\n10.1021/jacs.7b00513\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.068\n10.1098/rsif.2007.0220\n10.1002/bit.22647\n10.4172/2254-609X.100013\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.03.040\n10.1007/s40204-020-00137-0\n10.1038/nnano.2011.160\n10.1002/jbm.a.36886\n10.1016/j.carpath.2012.10.003\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.03.017\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2019.04.008\n10.3390/molecules25245858\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.024\n10.1038/srep04706\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01112\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.052\n10.1088/1748-605X/ac0452\n10.1007/s42242-020-00100-9\n10.1089/ten.teb.2019.0256\n10.1038/s41598-018-20006-y\n10.1016/j.matlet.2020.127865\n10.1038/nmeth.3839\n10.1039/b823523f\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.005\n10.1002/jbm.a.36538\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0197\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.580744\n10.1002/jbm.a.20002\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.04.007\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.11.023\n10.1007/s10856-020-06474-7\n10.1038/srep06425\n10.1073/pnas.1304913110\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1016/j.bpj.2019.02.018\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.019\n10.1093/nsr/nwaa254\n10.1016/j.jcis.2016.10.094\n10.1002/jbm.a.10585\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03494\n10.1021/ma300593g\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.08.033\n10.1007/s12195-018-0522-2\n10.3389/fphys.2021.710619\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.055\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.003638\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.08.007\n10.1038/nprot.2012.127\n10.1002/0471143030.cb1016s47\n10.1007/s12013-016-0758-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0201891\n10.1371/journal.pone.0241390\n10.1038/s41598-018-30360-6\n10.1080/00914037.2020.1825082\n10.1039/C7QM00028F\n10.1016/j.polymer.2003.10.047\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b00988\n10.1021/acsami.5b09344\n10.1021/acsomega.8b01205\n10.1007/s11095-008-9801-2\n10.1016/S1369-7021(05)71223-2\n10.1039/C6TB03050E\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.03.001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.07.010\n10.1002/bit.26929\n10.1161/JAHA.120.019338\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01409.x\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110382\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.01.018\n10.1021/acsami.7b01555\n10.1038/micronano.2016.80\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071812-152344"}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are extensively used in tissue engineering. However, transformation of MSCs into cardiac myocytes is still a challenge. Furthermore, weak adhesion of MSCs to substrates often results in poor cell viability. Here, we designed a composite matrix based on silk fibroin (SF) and graphene oxide (GO) for improving the cell adhesion and directing the differentiation of MSCs into cardiac myocytes. Specifically, patterned SF films were first produced by soft lithographic. After being treated by air plasma, GO nanosheets could be successfully coated on the patterned SF films to construct the desired matrix (P-GSF). The resultant P-GSF films presented a nano-topographic surface characterized by linear grooves interlaced with GO ridges. The P-GSF films exhibited high protein absorption and suitable mechanical strength. Furthermore, the P-GSF films accelerated the early cell adhesion and directed the growth orientation of MSCs. RT-PCR results and immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated that the P-GSF films significantly improved the cardiomyogenic differentiation of MSCs.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been studied in association with cardiac hypertrophy; however, the mechanisms by which circRNAs regulate cardiac hypertrophy remain unclear. In this study, we identified a new circRNA, named circCacna1c, in cardiac hypertrophy. Adult male C57BL/6 mice and H9c2 cells were treated with isoprenaline hydrochloride (ISO) to establish a hypertrophy model. We found that circCacna1c was upregulated in ISO-induced hypertrophic heart tissue and H9c2 cells. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that silencing circCacna1c inhibited hypertrophic gene expression in ISO-induced H9c2 cells. Mechanistically, circCacna1c competitively bound to miR-29b-2-5p in a dual-luciferase reporter assay, which was downregulated in ISO-induced hypertrophic heart tissue and H9c2 cells. MiR-29b-2-5p inhibited the nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc1) to control hypertrophic gene expression. After silencing circCacna1c, the expression of miR-29b-2-5p increased, which reduced hypertrophic gene expression by inhibiting NFATc1 expression.

{"title": "Dosiomics-Based Prediction of Radiation-Induced Valvulopathy after Childhood Cancer.", "abstract": "Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) is a known late complication of radiotherapy for childhood cancer (CC), and identifying high-risk survivors correctly remains a challenge. This paper focuses on the distribution of the radiation dose absorbed by heart tissues. We propose that a dosiomics signature could provide insight into the spatial characteristics of the heart dose associated with a VHD, beyond the already-established risk induced by high doses. We analyzed data from the 7670 survivors of the French Childhood Cancer Survivors' Study (FCCSS), 3902 of whom were treated with radiotherapy. In all, 63 (1.6%) survivors that had been treated with radiotherapy experienced a VHD, and 57 of them had heterogeneous heart doses. From the heart-dose distribution of each survivor, we extracted 93 first-order and spatial dosiomics features. We trained random forest algorithms adapted for imbalanced classification and evaluated their predictive performance compared to the performance of standard mean heart dose (MHD)-based models. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted for sub-populations of survivors with spatially heterogeneous heart doses. Our results suggest that MHD and dosiomics-based models performed equally well globally in our cohort and that, when considering the sub-population having received a spatially heterogeneous dose distribution, the predictive capability of the models is significantly improved by the use of the dosiomics features. If these findings are further validated, the dosiomics signature may be incorporated into machine learning algorithms for radiation-induced VHD risk assessment and, in turn, into the personalized refinement of follow-up guidelines.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2023-06-28", "authors": ["StefaniaChounta", "RodrigueAllodji", "MariaVakalopoulou", "MahmoudBentriou", "Duyen ThiDo", "FlorentDe Vathaire", "IbrahimaDiallo", "BriceFresneau", "ThibaudCharrier", "VincentZossou", "StergiosChristodoulidis", "SarahLemler", "VeroniqueLetort Le Chevalier"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers15123107\n10.3389/fonc.2021.679701\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.10.007\n10.1186/s13014-019-1360-7\n10.1186/s13014-018-1066-2\n10.3322/caac.21665\n10.1200/CCI.20.00176\n10.3389/fonc.2020.00790\n10.1200/JCO.2017.77.0180\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016686\n10.1136/bmj.l6794\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.08.006\n10.4414/smw.2019.20012\n10.1093/jnci/djv008\n10.3109/0284186X.2015.1016624\n10.1016/j.radonc.2023.109479\n10.1016/j.radonc.2011.08.040\n10.1136/heartjnl-2015-308765\n10.1002/pbc.22664\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.09.010\n10.1200/JCO.18.01764\n10.1182/blood-2010-06-291328\n10.1016/j.radonc.2021.08.012\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.11.036\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00269\n10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104625\n10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.08.009\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.07.1714\n10.1002/ejhf.1376\n10.1002/pbc.27495\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-0735\n10.1016/j.ejca.2010.01.022\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.08.335\n10.1016/0167-8140(96)01713-6\n10.1148/radiol.2020191145\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0339\n10.1007/BF01025868\n10.1186/s12911-022-02016-z\n10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x\n10.1016/j.coldregions.2021.103276\n10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2\n10.21105/joss.03021\n10.1109/MCSE.2007.55\n10.1186/s40959-022-00133-2\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00083\n10.3390/cancers13153835\n10.1088/1361-6498/aa575d\n10.1016/j.clon.2021.12.002\n10.1186/s13014-018-1132-9\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.186\n10.1093/ehjci/jeac106\n10.1016/j.echo.2020.10.002"}

While the effect of fiber orientation on the morphological structure of cardiomyocytes has been investigated, fibers only provide contact guidance without accounting for substrate stiffness due to their deposition on rigid substrates (e.g., glass or polystyrene). This paper introduces an in situ fabrication method for suspended and well aligned nanofibrous scaffolds via roller electrospinning, providing an anisotropic microenvironment with reduced stiffness for cardiac tissue engineering. A fiber surface modification strategy, utilizing oxygen plasma treatment combined with sodium dodecyl sulfate solution, was proposed to maintain the hydrophilicity of polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers, promoting cellular adhesion. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs), cultured on aligned fibers, exhibited an elongated morphology with extension along the fiber axis. In comparison to Petri dishes and suspended random fiber scaffolds, hiPSC-CMs on suspended aligned fiber scaffolds demonstrated enhanced sarcomere organization, spontaneous synchronous contraction, and gene expression indicative of maturation. This work demonstrates the suspended and aligned nano-fibrous scaffold provides a more realistic biomimetic environment for hiPSC-CMs, which promoted further research on the inducing effect of fiber scaffolds on hiPSC-CMs microstructure and gene-level expression.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-06-28", "authors": ["LinglingLiu", "FengXu", "HangJin", "BinQiu", "JianhuiYang", "WangzihanZhang", "QiangGao", "BinLin", "SongyueChen", "DaohengSun"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering10060702\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.008097\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c02906\n10.1021/acsabm.0c00754\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00837\n10.1080/17460441.2020.1736549\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1016/j.addr.2017.10.007\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c00348\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00178\n10.1253/circj.CJ-12-0987\n10.1002/cm.20290\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2006.03.011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.054\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302533\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.07.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.055\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.001\n10.1002/jbm.a.10083\n10.1073/pnas.0906504107\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.05.021\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.030\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.03.013\n10.1088/1758-5090/abff12\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/2/024107\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.042\n10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00178-7\n10.1002/adma.200803092\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141176\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.02.036\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2007.03.014\n10.1161/01.RES.0000047530.88338.EB\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.567842\n10.1021/acsami.8b13571\n10.1039/C7BM00323D\n10.3390/polym14214571\n10.3389/fendo.2017.00253\n10.1093/nar/gkl767\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00019\n10.1002/adma.202110441\n10.1126/science.1116995\n10.1126/science.2821619\n10.1038/nrm2957\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.042\n10.1242/bio.20133830\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1136/hrt.2005.066878\n10.1002/stem.166\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.214429\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.4.H1814\n10.1089/ten.tea.2022.0172\n10.1038/s41467-021-24049-0\n10.1089/ten.tec.2010.0405"}
{"title": "Circular RNA FEACR inhibits ferroptosis and alleviates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by interacting with NAMPT.", "abstract": "Emerging research has reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in cardiac cell death after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Ferroptosis, a new form of cell death discovered in recent years, has been proven to participate in the regulation of myocardial I/R. This study used circRNA sequencing to explore the key circRNA in the regulation of cardiac ferroptosis after I/R and study the mechanisms of potential circRNA function.\nWe performed circRNA sequencing to explore circRNAs differentially expressed after myocardial I/R. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to determine the circRNA expression in different tissues and detect the circRNA subcellular localization in the cardiomyocyte. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were aimed to examine the function of circRNAs in cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and cardiac tissue damage after myocardial I/R. RNA pull-down was applied to explore proteins interacting with circRNA.\nHere, we identified a ferroptosis-associated circRNA (FEACR) that has an underlying regulatory role in cardiomyocyte ferroptosis. FEACR overexpression suppressed I/R-induced myocardial infarction and ameliorated cardiac function. FEACR inhibition induces ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes and FEACR overexpression inhibits hypoxia and reoxygenation-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, FEACR directly bound to nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and enhanced the protein stability of NAMPT, which increased NAMPT-dependent Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) expression, which promoted the transcriptional activity of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) by reducing FOXO1 acetylation levels. FOXO1 further upregulated the transcription of ferritin heavy chain 1 (Fth1), a ferroptosis suppressor, which resulted in the inhibition of cardiomyocyte ferroptosis.\nOur finding reveals that the circRNA FEACR-mediated NAMPT-Sirt1-FOXO1-FTH1 signaling axis participates in the regulation of cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and protects the heart function against I/R injury. Thus, FEACR and its downstream factors could be novel targets for alleviating ferroptosis-related myocardial injury in ischemic heart diseases.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical science", "date": "2023-06-28", "authors": ["JieJu", "Xin-MinLi", "Xue-MeiZhao", "Fu-HaiLi", "Shao-CongWang", "KaiWang", "Rui-FengLi", "Lu-YuZhou", "LinLiang", "YinWang", "Yu-HuiZhang", "KunWang"], "doi": "10.1186/s12929-023-00927-1\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950\n10.1111/apha.13541\n10.14336/AD.2020.0323\n10.1016/bs.acc.2020.02.008\n10.1038/s41418-021-00872-2\n10.1038/cr.2017.31\n10.1038/s41420-021-00706-7\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.07.006\n10.1089/dna.2019.5097\n10.1038/s41418-018-0206-4\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.1172/JCI126428\n10.1007/s13238-020-00789-5\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.09.014\n10.1038/s41580-020-00324-8\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.12.010\n10.1111/jcmm.15725\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117422\n10.1186/s12906-019-2526-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316509\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.011\n10.1038/cr.2016.95\n10.1111/ajt.16475\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305962\n10.3389/fonc.2022.858598\n10.21037/tlcr-22-138\n10.1080/21655979.2022.2070582\n10.1016/j.reth.2022.04.005\n10.1038/s41420-020-00306-x\n10.1038/ncomms12429\n10.1016/j.tcb.2014.04.002\n10.1038/nrneph.2017.5\n10.1016/j.tem.2008.10.004\n10.1111/jnc.14878\n10.1038/onc.2015.415\n10.1073/pnas.0400593101\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.06.019\n10.1101/gad.14.2.142\n10.1016/j.tips.2017.02.005\n10.1038/nature14344\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.03.083\n10.1073/pnas.1422373112"}

Twenty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: Group I (Control). Group II (Que) received Que (75\u00a0mg/kg/day for 4\u00a0weeks) by oral gavage. Group III (PFOS group): supplemented orally with PFOS (20\u00a0mg/kg/day for 4\u00a0weeks) and Group IV (PF OS/Que). The rat heart was processed for histological, immunohistochemical, and gene expression studies. The PFOS group showed histological alterations in the myocardium that were partially reversed by the administration of Que. The inflammatory biomarkers (TNF, IL-6, and IL-1), lipid profile, TSH, MDA, and serum cardiac enzymes (LDH and CK-MB) were all altered.

Although sex and age differences in the development of chronic myocarditis have been postulated, underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the current study, we aimed to investigate sex and age differences in mitochondrial homeostasis, inflammation, and cellular senescence. Cardiac tissue samples from younger and older patients with inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMI) were used. The expression of Sirt1, phosphorylated AMPK, PGC-1\u03b1, Sirt3, acetylated SOD2, catalase, and several mitochondrial genes was analyzed to assess mitochondrial homeostasis. The expression of NF-\u03baB, TLR4, and interleukins was used to examine the inflammatory state in the heart. Finally, several senescence markers and telomere length were investigated. Cardiac AMPK expression and phosphorylation were significantly elevated in male DCMI patients, whereas Sirt1 expression remained unchanged in all groups investigated. AMPK upregulation was accompanied by a preserved expression of all mitochondrial proteins/genes investigated in older male DCMI patients, whereas the expression of TOM40, TIM23, and the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes was significantly reduced in older female patients. Mitochondrial homeostasis in older male patients was further supported by the reduced acetylation of mitochondrial proteins as indicated by acetylated SOD2. The inflammatory markers NF-\u03baB and TLR4 were downregulated in older male DCMI patients, whereas the expression of IL-18 was increased in older female patients. This was accompanied by progressed senescence in older DCMI hearts. In conclusion, older women experience more dramatic immunometabolic disorders on the cellular level than older men.", "journal": "Aging cell", "date": "2023-06-27", "authors": ["Maria LuisaBarcena", "GretaTonini", "NatalieHaritonow", "PavelasBreiter", "HendrikMilting", "IstvanBaczko", "UrsulaM\u00fcller-Werdan", "YuryLadilov", "VeraRegitz-Zagrosek"], "doi": "10.1111/acel.13894"}

Recent studies have certified safety and efficacy of PFA for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in the setting of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there are very limited data assessing the feasibility and safety of PFA ablation of different substrates within the left atrium in the setting of persistent AF.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of mitral isthmus (MI) ablation in addition to PVI and posterior wall (PW) ablation with PFA in patients with persistent AF.\nWe prospectively included all consecutive patients with persistent AF who underwent a first ablation procedure with PFA. We performed in all these patients a substrate ablation strategy comprising PVI, PW, and MI ablation with the use of PFA only. The primary feasibility endpoint was obtaining a persistent MI block at the end of the procedure. The safety endpoint was a composite of major safety events.\nFrom November 2021 to September 2022, we included 45 patients. Complete MI block was achieved in all 45 (100%).

Autophagy is critical for damage caused by pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that is effective in activating autophagy. However, the role of VMP1 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study was designed to explore the potential mechanisms of VMP1 on pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In this work, abdominal aorta constriction (AAC) surgery was used to induce pathological cardiac hypertrophy in male C57BL/6 mice. H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with phenylephrine stimulation (PE) to induce the hypertrophic response. The in vivo results revealed that mice with AAC surgery caused pathological cardiac hypertrophy as evidenced by improved cardiac function according to multiple echocardiographic parameters. Moreover, elevated VMP1 expression was also observed in mice after AAC surgery. VMP1 knockdown aggravated changes in cardiac structure, cardiac dysfunction, and fibrosis. Meanwhile, VMP1 knockdown suppressed autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity in heart tissues. H9C2 cardiomyocytes with VMP1 overexpression were used to investigate the specific mechanism of VMP1 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and VMP1 overexpression increased autophagic flux by upregulating SERCA activity. In conclusion, these findings revealed that VMP1 protected against pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy by inducing SERCA-regulated autophagic flux.

{"title": "Advances in biomaterial-based cardiac organoids.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the important causes of death worldwide. The incidence and mortality rates are increasing annually with the intensification of social aging. The efficacy of drug therapy is limited in individuals suffering from severe heart failure due to the inability of myocardial cells to undergo regeneration and the challenging nature of cardiac tissue repair following injury. Consequently, surgical transplantation stands as the most efficient approach for treatment. Nevertheless, the shortage of donors and the considerable number of heart failure patients worldwide, estimated at 26 million, results in an alarming treatment deficit, with only around 5000 heart transplants feasible annually. The existing major alternatives, such as mechanical or xenogeneic hearts, have significant flaws, such as high cost and rejection, and are challenging to implement for large-scale, long-term use. An organoid is a three-dimensional (3D) cell tissue that mimics the characteristics of an organ. The critical application has been rated in annual biotechnology by authoritative journals, such as Science and Cell. Related industries have achieved rapid growth in recent years. Based on this technology, cardiac organoids are expected to pave the way for viable heart repair and treatment and play an essential role in pathological research, drug screening, and other areas.

{"title": "CD24-Fc suppression of immune related adverse events in a therapeutic cancer vaccine model of murine neuroblastoma.", "abstract": "The combination of Myc-suppressed whole tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-L1 generates a potent therapeutic cancer vaccine in a mouse neuroblastoma model. As immunotherapies translate from pre-clinical to clinical trials, the potential immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with induction of potent immunity must be addressed. The CD24-Siglec 10/G interaction is an innate checkpoint that abrogates inflammatory responses to molecules released by damaged cells, but its role in cancer immunology is not well defined. We investigate irAEs of an effective whole cell neuroblastoma vaccine and subsequently the effect of CD24-Fc, a CD24 and Fc fusion protein, on both the vaccine efficacy and induced irAEs in a mouse neuroblastoma model.\nTo test whether the whole tumor cell vaccination leads to autoimmune responses in other organ systems we harvested lung, heart, kidney and colon from na\u00efve mice (n=3), unvaccinated tumor only mice (n=3), and vaccinated mice with CD24 Fc (n=12) or human IgG-Fc control (n=12) after tumor inoculation and vaccination therapy at day 30. The Immune cell infiltrates and immunogenic pathway signatures in different organ systems were investigated using NanoString Autoimmune Profiling arrays. Nanostring RNA transcript results were validated with immunohistochemistry staining.\nThe whole tumor cell vaccine combined with immune checkpoint therapy triggers occult organ specific immune cell infiltrates, primarily in cardiac tissue and to a lesser extent in the renal and lung tissue, but not in the colon. CD24-Fc administration with vaccination partially impedes anti-tumor immunity but delaying CD24-Fc administration after initial vaccination reverses this effect. CD24-Fc treatment also ameliorates the autoimmune response induced by effective tumor vaccination in the heart.\nThis study illustrates that the combination of Myc suppressed whole tumor cell vaccination with checkpoint inhibitors is an effective therapy, but occult immune infiltrates are induced in several organ systems in a mouse neuroblastoma model. The systemic administration of CD24-Fc suppresses autoimmune tissue responses, but appropriate timing of administration is critical for maintaining efficacy of the therapeutic vaccine.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2023-06-22", "authors": ["XiaofangWu", "PriyaSrinivasan", "MousumiBasu", "TaliaZimmerman", "SamuelLi", "YinWang", "PanZheng", "YangLiu", "Anthony DavidSandler"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2023.1176370\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2016.58\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0487\n10.1200/JCO.2015.60.8448\n10.1002/cncr.31629\n10.1093/annonc/mdw640\n10.1186/s40425-018-0346-6\n10.1038/onc.2016.104\n10.1016/j.it.2009.09.006\n10.1126/science.1168988\n10.1038/nbt.1846\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.01.011\n10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.741\n10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00058-5\n10.1038/s41586-019-1456-0\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01324\n10.1038/ncomms6909\n10.1084/jem.175.2.437\n10.1084/jem.185.2.251\n10.1084/jem.187.7.1151\n10.1136/jitc-2020-001388\n10.1038/nri2326\n10.1126/science.1133427\n10.1186/s40425-017-0215-8\n10.1155/2010/672395\n10.1016/j.jfma.2019.10.019\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.621627\n10.1182/blood-2013-12-545335"}
{"title": "TGF-\u03b21/SMAD3 Regulates Programmed Cell Death 5 That Suppresses Cardiac Fibrosis Post-Myocardial Infarction by Inhibiting HDAC3.", "abstract": "Progressive cardiac fibrosis leads to ventricular wall stiffness, cardiac dysfunction, and eventually heart failure, but the underlying mechanism remains unexplored. PDCD5 (programmed cell death 5) ubiquitously expresses in tissues, including the heart; however, the role of PDCD5 in cardiac fibrosis is largely unknown. Therefore, this study aims at exploring the possible role and underlying mechanisms of PDCD5 in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis.\nPDCD5 levels were found to be elevated in the serum obtained from patients with cardiac fibrosis, in fibrotic mice heart tissues after myocardial infarction, and in cardiac fibroblasts stimulated by Ang II (angiotensin II)- or TGF-\u03b21 (transforming growth factor-\u03b21). Overexpression of PDCD5 in cardiac fibroblasts or treatment with PDCD5 protein reduced the expression of profibrogenic proteins in response to TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, while knockdown of PDCD5 increased fibrotic responses. It has been demonstrated that SMAD3, a protein that is also known as mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3, directly upregulated PDCD5 during cardiac fibrosis. Subsequently, the increased PDCD5 promoted HDAC3 (histone deacetylase 3) ubiquitination, thus, inhibiting HDAC3 to reduce fibrotic responses. Fibroblast-specific knock-in of PDCD5 in mice ameliorated cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction and enhanced cardiac function, and these protective effects were eliminated by AAV9-mediated HDAC3 overexpression.\nThe findings of this study demonstrated that PDCD5 is upregulated by SMAD3 during cardiac fibrosis, which subsequently ameliorated progressive fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction through HDAC3 inhibition. Thus, this study suggests that PDCD5 functions as a negative feedback factor on fibrotic signaling pathways and might serve as a potential therapeutic target to suppress the progression of fibrotic responses.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2023-06-22", "authors": ["LinWeng", "JingjingYe", "FengheYang", "ShiJia", "MinghongLeng", "BoJia", "ChunlingXu", "YangZhao", "RuxiaLiu", "YufeiXiong", "YiqingZhou", "JunhuiZhao", "MingZheng"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.322596"}

In the present study, we examined the effects of Eryngium billardieri extract, as an anti-diabetic herbal medication, on the heart mRNA level of Akt serine/threonine kinase (Akt), mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), and Forkhead box o1 (Foxo1) in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR). We also assessed the anti-diabetic effects of E.\u00a0billardieri extract in rats with insulin resistance.\nTwenty-seven male Wistar rats were divided into two groups. Nine rats were fed a normal diet (control group), and 18 rats were fed an HFD for 13 weeks (HFD group). To confirm the induction of insulin resistance, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Then rats with IR were randomly divided into the following groups: the HFD group, which continued an HFD, and the group treated with E.\u00a0billardieri extract, which received the extract at a concentration of 50\u00a0mg/kg for 30 days. On the 30th day, the animals were sacrificed and serum samples were collected for biochemistry analyses. Furthermore, the expression of Akt, mTOR, PPAR\u03b3, and Foxo1 was measured in heart tissue using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.\nReal-time PCR analyses revealed that an HFD can significantly decrease the expression level of Akt, mTOR, and PPAR\u03b3 in the heart tissue. However, an HFD significantly increased the expression level of Foxo1 in the HFD group compared to the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, our data showed that the administration of E. billardieri extract significantly enhanced the mRNA levels of Akt, PPAR\u03b3, and mTOR in the heart tissue compared to the HFD group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while it significantly decreased the Foxo1 mRNA levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nGiven that Akt, mTOR, PPAR\u03b3, and Foxo1 are critical factors in insulin resistance, the present study suggests that E.\u00a0billardieri could probably be used as an alternative treatment for IR as a major feature of metabolic syndrome.", "journal": "Clinical nutrition ESPEN", "date": "2023-06-22", "authors": ["Mohaddeseh RashediOsqueei", "Ali ZareeMahmoudabadi", "ZahraBahari", "Gholam HosseinMeftahi", "MonirehMovahedi", "RezaTaghipour", "NaserMousavi", "Hasan FallahHuseini", "ZohrehJangravi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clnesp.2023.04.016"}

As a new type of cell death, ferroptosis provides new opportunities to reduce myocardial cell death. Ferroptosis is known to be more active during reperfusion than ischemia. However, the mechanisms regulating ferroptosis during ischemia and reperfusion remain largely unknown.\nThe contribution of ferroptosis in ischemic and reperfused myocardium were detected by administered of Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor to C57BL/6 mice, followed by left anterior descending (LAD) ligation surgery. Ferroptosis was evaluated by measurement of cell viability, ptgs2 mRNA level, iron production, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) levels. H9C2 cells were exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation to mimic in vivo I/R. We used LC-MS/MS to identify potential E3 ligases that interacted with frataxin in heart tissue. Cardiac-specific overexpression of frataxin in whole heart was achieved by intracardiac injection of frataxin, carried by adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) containing cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter.\nWe showed that regulators of iron metabolism, especially iron regulatory protein activity, were increased in the ischemic myocardium or hypoxia cardiomyocytes. In addition, we found that frataxin, which is involved in iron metabolism, is differentially expressed in the ischemic and reperfused myocardium and involved in the regulation of cardiomyocytes ferroptosis. Furthermore, we identified an E3 ligase, NHL repeat-containing 1 (NHLRC1), that mediates frataxin ubiquitination degradation. Cardiac-specific overexpression of frataxin ameliorated myocardial I/R injury through ferroptosis inhibition.\nThrough a multi-level study from molecule to animal model, these findings uncover the key role of frataxin in inhibiting cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and provide new strategies and perspectives for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2023-06-22", "authors": ["ZihuiZhang", "WenhuaJiang", "ChanZhang", "YueYin", "NanMu", "YishiWang", "LuYu", "HengMa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2023.06.016"}

{"title": "High-resolution multi-z confocal microscopy with a diffractive optical element.", "abstract": "There has been recent interest in the development of fluorescence microscopes that provide high-speed volumetric imaging for life-science applications. For example, multi-z confocal microscopy enables simultaneous optically-sectioned imaging at multiple depths over relatively large fields of view.

Here we present a variant of multi-z microscopy that recovers the full spatial resolution of a conventional confocal microscope while retaining the simplicity and ease of use of our initial design. By introducing a diffractive optical element in the illumination path of our microscope, we engineer the excitation beam into multiple tightly focused spots that are conjugated to axially distributed confocal pinholes. We discuss the performance of this multi-z microscope in terms of resolution and detectability and demonstrate its versatility by performing ", "journal": "Biomedical optics express", "date": "2023-06-21", "authors": ["BingyingZhao", "MinoruKoyama", "JeromeMertz"], "doi": "10.1364/BOE.491538\n10.1126/science.aaq1392\n10.1364/OPTICA.6.001261\n10.1109/JDT.2015.2404347\n10.1364/OL.42.000995\n10.1364/OL.32.002007\n10.1007/s00348-017-2316-z\n10.3390/photonics9070501\n10.1038/s41566-018-0109-4\n10.1038/nmeth.2277\n10.1073/pnas.1412396111\n10.1364/BOE.7.000726\n10.1364/OL.28.001918\n10.1364/OPTICA.404678\n10.1364/OPTICA.468583\n10.1016/j.bpr.2022.100046\n10.1038/nmeth.2964\n10.1038/s41598-022-21240-1\n10.1038/s41592-019-0393-z\n10.1364/OL.42.004183\n10.1364/OE.451409\n10.1111/jmi.12799\n10.1038/s41592-019-0622-5\n10.1038/s41377-020-0245-8\n10.1364/OPTICA.472674\n10.1364/BOE.9.001992\n10.1101/2022.03.05.483143\n10.1038/s41592-019-0728-9\n10.1038/s41592-021-01239-8\n10.1364/OPTICA.6.000389\n10.1101/2021.12.10.472140\n10.1364/BOE.417286\n10.1186/1475-925X-2-13\n10.1002/sca.4950150402\n10.1038/s41378-020-00234-x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042339\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.3389/fninf.2016.00006\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.11.037\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.18.012502.105840\n10.1364/OE.450745\n10.1364/OE.22.019293\n10.1364/BOE.7.001656\n10.1364/OPTICA.384164\n10.1101/2022.08.05.502947\n10.1038/s41565-017-0034-6\n10.1038/nphoton.2009.264\n10.1364/OE.16.022048\n10.1364/OE.22.004029\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00629\n10.1038/nprot.2014.087"}
{"title": "Conductive Bacterial Nanocellulose-Polypyrrole Patches Promote Cardiomyocyte Differentiation.", "abstract": "The low endogenous regenerative capacity of the heart, added to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, triggered the advent of cardiac tissue engineering in the last decades. The myocardial niche plays a critical role in directing the function and fate of cardiomyocytes; therefore, engineering a biomimetic scaffold holds excellent promise. We produced an electroconductive cardiac patch of bacterial nanocellulose (BC) with polypyrrole nanoparticles (Ppy NPs) to mimic the natural myocardial microenvironment. BC offers a 3D interconnected fiber structure with high flexibility, which is ideal for hosting Ppy nanoparticles. BC-Ppy composites were produced by decorating the network of BC fibers (65 \u00b1 12 nm) with conductive Ppy nanoparticles (83 \u00b1 8 nm). Ppy NPs effectively augment the conductivity, surface roughness, and thickness of BC composites despite reducing scaffolds' transparency. BC-Ppy composites were flexible (up to 10 mM Ppy), maintained their intricate 3D extracellular matrix-like mesh structure in all Ppy concentrations tested, and displayed electrical conductivities in the range of native cardiac tissue. Furthermore, these materials exhibit tensile strength, surface roughness, and wettability values appropriate for their final use as cardiac patches.

Current clinical interventions include invasive approaches for progressed conditions and pharmacological assistance for initial stages, which has systemic side effects. Preventive, curative, diagnostic, and theranostic (therapeutic + diagnostic) approaches till date are not very useful in combating the ongoing CVD epidemic, which demands a promising efficient alternative approach. To combat the growing CVD outbreak globally, the ideal strategy is to make the therapeutic intervention least invasive and direct to the heart to reduce the bystander effects on other organs and increase the bioavailability of the therapeutics to the myocardium. The application of nanoscience and nanoparticle-mediated approaches have gained a lot of momentum because of their efficient passive and active myocardium targeting capability owing to their improved specificity and controlled release. This review provides extensive insight into the various types of nanoparticles available for CVDs, their mechanisms of targeting (eg, direct or indirect), and the utmost need for further development of bench-to-bedside cardiac tissue-based nanomedicines. Furthermore, the review aims to summarize the different ideas and methods of nanoparticle-mediated therapeutic approaches to the myocardium till date with present clinical trials and future perspectives.

{"title": "An Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Cardiac Tissue-Patch Interrelation.", "abstract": "Tissue engineered cardiac patches have great potential as a regenerative therapy for myocardial infarction. Yet, the mutual interaction of cardiac patches with healthy tissue has not been completely understood. Here, we investigated the impact of acellular and cellular patches on a beating two-dimensional (2D) cardiac cell layer, and the effect of the beating of this layer on the cells encapsulated in the patch. We cultured human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) on a coverslip and placed gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel alone or with encapsulated iCMs to create acellular and cellular patches, respectively. When the acellular patch was placed on the cardiac cell layer, the beating characteristics and Ca+2 handling properties reduced, whereas placing the cellular patch restored these characteristics. To better understand the effects of the cyclic contraction and relaxation induced by the beating cardiac cell layer on the patch placed on top of it, a simulation model was developed, and the calculated strain values were in agreement with the values measured experimentally.

{"title": "Designing a Bioreactor to Improve Data Acquisition and Model Throughput of Engineered Cardiac Tissues.", "abstract": "Heart failure remains the leading cause of death worldwide, creating a pressing need for better preclinical models of the human heart. Tissue engineering is crucial for basic science cardiac research; in vitro human cell culture eliminates the interspecies differences of animal models, while a more tissue-like 3D environment (e.g., with extracellular matrix and heterocellular coupling) simulates in vivo conditions to a greater extent than traditional two-dimensional culture on plastic Petri dishes. However, each model system requires specialized equipment, for example, custom-designed bioreactors and functional assessment devices. Additionally, these protocols are often complicated, labor-intensive, and plagued by the failure of the small, delicate tissues. This paper describes a process for generating a robust human engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) model system using induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes for the longitudinal measurement of tissue function. Six hECTs with linear strip geometry are cultured in parallel, with each hECT\u00a0suspended from a pair of force-sensing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) posts attached to PDMS racks. Each post is capped with a black PDMS stable post tracker (SPoT), a new feature that improves the ease of use, throughput, tissue retention, and data quality. The shape allows for the reliable optical tracking of post deflections, yielding improved twitch force tracings with absolute active and passive tension. The cap geometry eliminates tissue failure due to hECTs slipping off the posts, and as they involve a second step after PDMS rack fabrication, the SPoTs can be added to existing PDMS post-based designs without major changes to the bioreactor fabrication process. The system is used to demonstrate the importance of measuring hECT function at physiological temperatures and shows stable tissue function during data acquisition. In summary, we describe a state-of-the-art model system that reproduces key physiological conditions to advance the biofidelity, efficiency, and rigor of engineered cardiac tissues for in vitro applications.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2023-06-19", "authors": ["Camille Cvan Neste", "Karlo AWiley", "Serena WChang", "JosephBorrello", "Irene CTurnbull", "Kevin DCosta"], "doi": "10.3791/64368"}

However, different mutations in MYH7 lead to variable penetrance and clinical severity, and alter myosin function to varying degrees, making it difficult to determine genotype-phenotype relationships, especially when caused by rare gene variants such as the G256E mutation.\nThis study aims to determine the effects of low penetrant MYH7 G256E mutation on myosin function.

We also used our previously published data on other mutations to compare the degree to which myosin function was altered.\nAt the protein level, the G256E mutation disrupts the transducer region of the S1 head and reduces the fraction of myosin in the folded-back state by 50.9%, suggesting more myosins available for contraction. Myofibrils isolated from hiPSC-CMs CRISPR-edited with G256E (MYH7 \nMYH7 G256E mutation causes structural instability in the transducer region, leading to hypercontractility across scales, perhaps from increased myosin recruitment and altered crossbridge cycling.

{"title": "The role of Zn2+ in shaping intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in the heart.", "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that Zn2+ acts as a second messenger capable of transducing extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling events. The importance of Zn2+ as a signaling molecule in cardiovascular functioning is gaining traction. In the heart, Zn2+ plays important roles in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, excitation-transcription coupling, and cardiac ventricular morphogenesis. Zn2+ homeostasis in cardiac tissue is tightly regulated through the action of a combination of transporters, buffers, and sensors. Zn2+ mishandling is a common feature of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the precise mechanisms controlling the intracellular distribution of Zn2+ and its variations during normal cardiac function and during pathological conditions are not fully understood. In this review, we consider the major pathways by which the concentration of intracellular Zn2+ is regulated in the heart, the role of Zn2+ in EC coupling, and discuss how Zn2+ dyshomeostasis resulting from altered expression levels and efficacy of Zn2+ regulatory proteins are key drivers in the progression of cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date":

This study investigates Amber as compared with formalin with respect to the following aspects: (1) histologic preservation, (2) epitope integrity with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF), and (3) integrity of tissue RNA. Rat and human lung, liver, kidney, and heart tissues were collected and stored for 24 hours at 4 \u00b0C in Amber or formalin. The tissues were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin; IHC: thyroid transcription factor, muscle-specific actin, hepatocyte-specific antigen, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen; and IF: VE-cadherin, vimentin, and muscle-specific actin. RNA quality upon extraction was also assessed. Amber demonstrated superior and/or noninferior performance in rat and human tissue evaluation with respect to standard techniques of histology, IHC, IF, and extracted RNA quality. Amber maintains high-quality morphology without compromising the ability to perform IHC and nucleic acid extraction. As such, Amber could be a safer and superior substitute to formalin for clinical tissue preservation for contemporary pathological examination.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2023-06-16", "authors": ["Diana DVucevic", "Michael ASeidman", "KumiMesaki", "ZehongGuan", "StephenJuvet", "MingyaoLiu", "ShafKeshavjee", "KieranMurphy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.labinv.2023.100198"}
{"title": "Endogenous interleukin-22 prevents cardiac rupture after myocardial infarction in mice.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) can result in fatal myocardial rupture or heart failure due to adverse remodeling and dysfunction of the left ventricle. Although recent studies have shown that exogenous interleukin (IL)-22 shows cardioprotective effect after MI, the pathophysiological significance of endogenous IL-22 is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of endogenous IL-22 in a mouse model of MI. We produced MI model by permanent ligation of the left coronary artery in wild-type (WT) and IL-22 knock-out (KO) mice. The post-MI survival rate was significantly worse in IL-22KO mice than in WT mice due to a higher rate of cardiac rupture. Although IL-22KO mice exhibited a significantly greater infarct size than WT mice, there was no significant difference in left ventricular geometry or function between WT and IL-22KO mice. IL-22KO mice showed increase in infiltrating macrophages and myofibroblasts, and altered expression pattern of inflammation- and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes after MI. While IL-22KO mice showed no obvious changes in cardiac morphology or function before MI, expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were increased, whereas that of tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP)-3 was decreased in cardiac tissue. Protein expression of IL-22 receptor complex, IL-22 receptor alpha 1 (IL-22R1) and IL-10 receptor beta (IL-10RB), were increased in cardiac tissue 3 days after MI, regardless of the genotype.

{"title": "Semaglutide ameliorates obesity-induced cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress mediated via reduction of neutrophil Cxcl2, S100a8, and S100a9 expression.", "abstract": "Obesity, which is driven by inflammation and oxidative stress, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is an antidiabetic drug with major effects on weight loss. In this study, single-cell transcriptomics was used to examine non-cardiomyocytes to uncover the mechanism of obesity-induced myocardial damage and the cardioprotective impact of semaglutide. We constructed obese mouse models and measured Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and Malonic dialdehyde (MDA) levels in serum and heart tissue to determine the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in obesity and the effect of semaglutide on these levels. Then, utilizing single-cell transcriptomes to screen for key cell populations and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we assessed the effects of obesity and semaglutide on non-cardiac cells. Finally, a DEG localization analysis was performed to explore DEGs as well as cell types associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Semaglutide reduced increased TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, ROS, and MDA levels in serum and cardiac tissues in obese mouse. Several genes are closely associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (Cxcl2), S100 calcium binding protein A8 (S100a8), and S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100a9), which were elevated in obesity but decreased following semaglutide treatment, were also expressed particularly in neutrophils. Finally, by decreasing neutrophil Cxcl2, S100a8, and S100a9 expressions, semaglutide may help to reduce cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress. Semaglutide significantly reduced body weight in obese mice as well as exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects possibly by inhibiting the expression of S100a8, S100a9, and Cxcl2 in neutrophils.

Current strategies of regulating inflammation or improving cardiac tissue regeneration have limited success. Herein, a hybrid hydrogel coassembled by acellular cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunomodulatory glycopeptide is developed for endogenous tissue regeneration after MI. The hydrogel constructs a niche recapitulating the architecture of native ECM for attracting host cell homing, controlling macrophage differentiation via glycopeptide unit, and promoting endotheliocyte proliferation by enhancing the macrophage-endotheliocyte crosstalk, which coordinate the innate healing mechanism for cardiac tissue regeneration. In a rodent MI model, the hybrid hydrogel successfully orchestrates a proreparative response indicated by enhanced M2 macrophage polarization, increased angiogenesis, and improved cardiomyocyte survival, which alleviates infarct size, improves wall thicknesses, and enhances cardiac contractility. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of the hydrogel are demonstrated in a porcine MI model, wherein proteomics verifies the regulation of immune response, proangiogenesis, and accelerated healing process. Collectively, the injectable composite hydrogel serving as an immunomodulatory niche for promoting cell homing and proliferation, inflammation modulation, tissue remodeling, and function restoration provides an effective strategy for endogenous cardiac repair.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2023-06-15", "authors": ["PengxuKong", "JingDong", "WenchaoLi", "ZefuLi", "RuiGao", "XiangLiu", "JingrongWang", "QiSu", "BinWen", "WenbinOuyang", "ShouzhengWang", "FengwenZhang", "ShuyiFeng", "DonglinZhuang", "YongquanXie", "GuangzhiZhao", "HangYi", "ZujianFeng", "WeiweiWang", "XiangbinPan"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202301244\n10.1002/adhm.202300029"}

However, conventional polystyrene-based cell culture substrates have adverse effects on cardiomyocytes in vitro due to the stress applied by a stiff substrate on contractile cells. Ultra-high viscosity alginates offer a unique versatility as tunable substrates for cardiac cell cultures due to their biocompatibility, flexible biofunctionalization, and stability. In this work, we analyzed the effect of alginate substrates on hPSC-CM maturity and functionality. Alginate substrates in high-throughput compatible culture formats fostered a more mature gene expression and enabled the simultaneous assessment of chronotropic and inotropic effects upon beta-adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, we produced 3D-printed alginate scaffolds with differing mechanical properties and plated hPSC-CMs on the surface of these to create Heart Patches for tissue engineering applications. These exhibited synchronous macro-contractions in concert with more mature gene expression patterns and extensive intracellular alignment of sarcomeric structures. In conclusion, the combination of biofunctionalized alginates and human cardiomyocytes represents a valuable tool for both in vitro modeling and regenerative medicine, due to its beneficial effects on cardiomyocyte physiology, the possibility to analyze cardiac contractility, and its applicability as Heart Patches.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Early diagnosis and treatments are crucial for preventing the development of CHF. Herein, we aimed to identify novel diagnostic biomarker, therapeutic target and drug for CHF. Untargeted metabolomic analysis has been used to characterize the different metabolomic profile between CHF patients and healthy people. Meanwhile, the targeted metabolomic study demonstrated the elevation of 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) in the serum of CHF patients and coronary artery ligation-induced CHF mice. Subsequently, we firstly observed that elevation of CMPF impaired cardiac function and aggravated myocardial injury by enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Interestingly, inhibition of responsible transporters organic anion transporter 1/3 (OAT1/3) has been found to decrease the CMPF level, and suppress FAO-related key protein expressions including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-\u03b1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, and malonyl CoA decarboxylase in coronary artery ligation-induced CHF mice. Meanwhile, the inhibitor of OAT1/3 presented an excellent improvement in cardiac function and histological injury. Based on the above findings, molecular docking was adopted to screen the potential therapeutic drug targeting OAT1/3, and ruscogenin (RUS) exhibited a great binding affinity with OAT1 and OAT3. Next, it was verified that RUS could remarkedly decrease the expression of OAT1/3 and CMPF levels in heart tissue of CHF mice, as well as suppress the expression of FAO-related proteins. What's more, RUS can effectively improve cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis and morphological damage. Collectively, this study provided a potential metabolic marker CMPF and novel target OAT1/3 for CHF, which were demonstrated to be involved in FAO. And RUS was identified as a potential anti-FAO drug for CHF by regulating OAT1/3.", "journal": "Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine", "date": "2023-06-15", "authors": ["QiongLai", "XiaozhouZhu", "LuZhang", "JunpingKou", "FumingLiu", "BoyangYu", "FangLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.trsl.2023.06.001"}

It is recorded in the \"Shang Han Lun\" that licorice has better protection on heart after honey-processed. However, researches regarding its protective effect on the heart and the distribution of HPL in vivo are still limited.\nTo evaluate the cardio-protection of HPL and explore the law of ten main components distribution in vivo under physiological and pathological conditions for an attempt to clarify the pharmacological substance basis of HPL in treating arrhythmia.\nThe adult zebrafish arrhythmia model was established by doxorubicin (DOX). Electrocardiogram (ECG) was used to detect the heart rate changes of zebrafish. SOD and MDA assays were used to evaluate oxidative stress levels in the myocardium. HE staining was used to observe the morphological change of myocardial tissues after HPL treatment. The UPLC-MS/MS was adapted to detect the content of ten main components of HPL in heart, liver, intestine, and brain under normal and heart injury conditions.\nHeart rate of zebrafish was decreased, the SOD activity was attenuated and MDA content was increased in myocardium after administration of DOX. Moreover, tissue vacuolation and inflammatory infiltration were detected in zebrafish myocardium induced by DOX. HPL could ameliorate heart injury and bradycardia induced by DOX to a certain extent by increasing SOD activity and reducing MDA content. In addition, the study of tissue distribution revealed that the content of liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and isoliquiritigenin in the heart was higher in the presence of arrhythmias than those in the normal condition. Under pathological conditions, the heart highly exposed to these three components could elicit anti-arrhythmic effects by regulating immunity and oxidation.\nThese findings indicate that the HPL is protective against heart injury induced by DOX, and its effect is associated with the alleviation of oxidative stress and tissue injury. And the cardioprotective effect of HPL under pathological conditions may be related to the high distribution of liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and isoliquiritigenin in heart tissue.

STAT3 plays a critical role in \u03b2-adrenergic functions in the heart. However, whether STAT3 contributed to \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated PERK activation and how \u03b2-adrenergic signaling activates STAT3 remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation contributed to the PERK arm activation in cardiomyocytes and if IL-6/gp130 signaling was involved in the chronic \u03b2-AR-stimulation-induced STAT3 and PERK arm activation. We found that the PERK phosphorylation was positively associated with STAT3 activation. Wild-type STAT3 plasmids transfection activated the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP pathway in cardiomyocytes while dominant negative Y705F STAT3 plasmids caused no obvious effect on PERK signaling. Stimulation with isoproterenol produced a significant increase in the level of IL-6 in the cardiomyocyte's supernatants, while IL-6 silence inhibited PERK phosphorylation but failed to attenuate STAT3 activation in response to isoproterenol stimulation. Gp130 silence attenuated isoproterenol-induced STAT3 activation and PERK phosphorylation. Inhibiting IL-6/gp130 pathway by bazedoxifene and inhibiting STAT3 by stattic both reversed isoproterenol-induced STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation, ROS production, PERK activation, IRE1\u03b1 activation, and cardiomyocytes apoptosis in vitro. Bazedoxifene (5\u00a0mg/kg/day by oral gavage once a day) exhibited similar effect as carvedilol (10\u00a0mg/kg/day by oral gavage once a day) on attenuating chronic isoproterenol (30\u00a0mg/kg by abdominal injection once a day, 7 days) induced cardiac systolic dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in C57BL/6 mice.

Random selection was made on sites of burger meat that was for sale.\nSimultaneous presence of several mycotoxins in the same sample of imported meat under the set conditions of LCMS/MS detected 26% (18 samples) were positive for various mycotoxins. The most frequent mycotoxins proportion in the analyzed samples was aflatoxin B1 (50%) followed by aflatoxin G1 (44%), aflatoxin G2 (38.8%), aflatoxin B2 (33%) respectively were least among all with 16.66 and 11.11%.\nA positive correlation is deduced between CVD and mycotoxin present in burger meat. Isolated mycotoxins initiate death receptor-mediated apoptosis, death receptor-mediated necrosis, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, mitochondrial-mediated necrosis, and immunogenic cell deaths through various pathways that can damage the cardiac tissues.\nThe presence of these toxins in such samples is just the tip of the iceberg. Further investigation is necessary for complete clarifications of toxins on human health especially on CVD and other related metabolic complications.", "journal": "Current medicinal chemistry", "date": "2023-06-12", "authors": ["Maged AlAnsari", "Fahad A AlAbbasi", "SalmanHosawi", "Mirza RafiBaig", "SultanAlhayyani", "VikasKumar", "Turky OmarAsar", "FirozAnwar"], "doi": "10.2174/0929867330666230609100707"}

The aim of this study was to determine how chronic oxaliplatin treatment causes the changes in energy-related metabolic activity in the heart that leads to cardiotoxicity and heart damage in mice. C57BL/6 male mice were treated with a human equivalent dosage of intraperitoneal oxaliplatin (0 and 10 mg/kg) once a week for eight weeks. During the treatment, mice were followed for physiological parameters, ECG, histology and RNA sequencing of the heart. We identified that oxaliplatin induces strong changes in the heart and affects the heart's energy-related metabolic profile. Histological post-mortem evaluation identified focal myocardial necrosis infiltrated with a small number of associated neutrophils. Accumulated doses of oxaliplatin led to significant changes in gene expression related to energy related metabolic pathways including fatty acid (FA) oxidation, amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, electron transport chain, and NAD synthesis pathway. At high accumulative doses of oxaliplatin, the heart shifts its metabolism from FAs to glycolysis and increases lactate production.

{"title": "Nanoengineering of gold nanoribbon-embedded isogenic stem cell-derived cardiac organoids.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering is an emerging field providing tools to treat and study cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In the past years, the integration of stem cell technologies with micro- and nanoengineering techniques has enabled the creation of novel engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) with potential applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. However, a major unaddressed limitation of stem cell-derived ECTs is their immature state, resembling a neonatal phenotype and genotype. The modulation of the cellular microenvironment within the ECTs has been proposed as an efficient mechanism to promote cellular maturation and improve features such as cellular coupling and synchronization. The integration of biological and nanoscale cues in the ECTs could serve as a tool for the modification and control of the engineered tissue microenvironment. Here we present a proof-of-concept study for the integration of biofunctionalized gold nanoribbons (AuNRs) with hiPSC-derived isogenic cardiac organoids to enhance tissue function and maturation. We first present extensive characterization of the synthesized AuNRs, their PEGylation and cytotoxicity evaluation. We then evaluated the functional contractility and transcriptomic profile of cardiac organoids fabricated with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (mono-culture) as well as with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (co-culture). We demonstrated that PEGylated AuNRs are biocompatible and do not induce cell death in hiPSC-derived cardiac cells and organoids. We also found an improved transcriptomic profile of the co-cultured organoids indicating maturation of the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in the presence of cardiac fibroblasts. Overall, we present for the first time the integration of AuNRs into cardiac organoids, showing promising results for improved tissue function.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2023-06-08", "authors": ["AlejandraPatino-Guerrero", "HamidEsmaeili", "Raymond QMigrino", "MehdiNikkhah"], "doi": "10.1039/d3ra01811c\n10.3791/52628"}

We demonstrate that heart-derived collagen induces better contraction and relaxation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived EHT (hiPSC-EHT) and that hiPSC-EHT with heart-derived collagen exhibit more mature profiles than those with collagens from other organs. Further, we found that collagen fibril formation and gel stiffness influence the contraction, relaxation, and maturation of hiPSC-EHT, suggesting the importance of collagen types III and type V, which are relatively abundant in the heart.

{"title": "Sodium channel subpopulations with distinct biophysical properties and subcellular localization enhance cardiac conduction.", "abstract": "Sodium (Na+) current is responsible for the rapid depolarization of cardiac myocytes that triggers the cardiac action potential upstroke. Recent studies have illustrated the presence of multiple pools of Na+ channels with distinct biophysical properties and subcellular localization, including clustering of channels at the intercalated disk and along the lateral membrane. Computational studies predict that Na+ channel clusters at the intercalated disk can regulate cardiac conduction via modulation of the narrow intercellular cleft between electrically coupled myocytes. However, these studies have primarily focused on the redistribution of Na+ channels between intercalated disk and lateral membranes and have not considered the distinct biophysical properties of the Na+ channel subpopulations. In this study, we use computational modeling to simulate computational models of single cardiac cells and one-dimensional cardiac tissues and predict the function of distinct Na+ channel subpopulations. Single-cell simulations predict that a subpopulation of Na+ channels with shifted steady-state activation and inactivation voltage dependency promotes an earlier action potential upstroke. In cardiac tissues that account for distinct subcellular spatial localization, simulations predict that shifted Na+ channels contribute to faster and more robust conduction in response to changes in tissue structure (i.e., cleft width), gap junctional coupling, and rapid pacing rates. Simulations predict that the intercalated disk-localized shifted Na+ channels contribute proportionally more to total Na+ charge than lateral membrane-localized Na+ channels.

{"title": "Proteomic profiling of sudden cardiac death with acquired cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy, which develops in middle-aged and older individuals as a consequence of hypertension and obesity, is an established risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD). However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate SCD with acquired cardiac hypertrophy (SCH) from compensated cardiac hypertrophy (CCH), at autopsy. We aimed to elucidate the proteomic alteration in SCH, which can be a guideline for future postmortem diagnosis.\nCardiac tissues were sampled at autopsy. SCH group consisted of ischemic heart failure, hypertensive heart failure, and aortic stenosis. CCH group included cases of non-cardiac death with cardiac hypertrophy. The control group comprised cases of non-cardiac death without cardiac hypertrophy. All patients were aged\u2009>\u200940\u00a0years, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was not included in this study. We performed histological examination and shotgun proteomic analysis, followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.\nSignificant obesity and myocardial hypertrophy, and mild myocardial fibrosis were comparable in SCH and CCH cases compared to control cases. The proteomic profile of SCH cases was distinguishable from those of CCH and control cases, and many sarcomere proteins were increased in SCH cases.

{"title": "Serum lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzymes as predictors of clinical outcomes in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective analysis of a hospitalized cohort.", "abstract": "We aimed to test the association between serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and its isoenzymes and treatment outcomes during hospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Thirty-eight AECOPD patients were recruited from a tertiary hospital from December 2017 to June 2018. Serum LDH and LDH isoenzymes were measured on venous blood collected at admission. Treatment outcomes included duration of hospital stay, initiation of non-invasive (NIV) or mechanical ventilation, initiation of antipseudomonal antibiotics, change in empirical antibiotic treatment, need for intravenous corticosteroids or methylxanthines, and percentage of change in C-reactive protein from admission to the third day. Multivariate linear and binary logistic regression analyses were used to test the study's objectives. We found that, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, COPD severity, level of hypoxemia, and inflammation markers, each 10 U/L increase in serum LDH was associated with prolongation of the hospital stay by 0.25 (0.03, 0.46) days, 42% higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.42 [1.00, 2.03]) for need of NIV, and 25% higher odds (OR 1.25 [1.04, 1.49]) for initiation of antipseudomonal treatment. LDH1 and LDH2 were the LDH isoenzymes that mainly drove these relationships. LDH release in the context of an AECOPD could originate from lung, muscle, or heart tissue damage due to airway inflammation, respiratory muscle recruitment, and myocardial stress. Myocardial injury and aerobic adaptation in respiratory muscles may explain the predominance of LDH1 and LDH2 isoenzymes in these associations.", "journal": "Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace", "date": "2023-06-07", "authors": ["DimitriosPapadopoulos", "VlasiosSkopas", "NikolaosTrakas", "EleniPapaefstathiou", "NikolaosTzogas", "DemosthenesMakris", "ZoeDaniil", "KonstantinosGourgoulianis"], "doi": "10.4081/monaldi.2023.2543"}

Protein lysates from the heart tissues of the mice were obtained via ho-mogenization and centrifugation. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H and E) were done to see the fat droplets in the liver tissues at the different developmental stages.\nLXR\u03b1,SREBP-1C expression in 3 months embryo and 4 months embryo is highly expressed in the high-fat diet. LDL-R in the high-fat diet mice is increased in 3 days infant heart but in 3 months and 4 months embryo it has low expression but from the 0th day to the 4 weeks the expression is in a decreasing trend. Similarly, LPL is highly expressed in 3 months embryo and 0th day(Birthday) and thus low expression indecreasing order until 4 weeks infant. Thus, these results collectively show that a maternal HF diet in-creases the expression of proteins such as LPL, and LDLr in the embryo phase and thus getting normal ex-pressions in the adult phase that facilitate Triglycerides (TAG) hydrolysis across the liver and the heart. Also, maternal high-fat diet increases the SREBP1c expression, leading to stimulation of LPL Expression.\nIn summary, using a pregnant mice model, we found that a maternal high-fat diet increases fe-tal fat accumulation. Elevated placental LPL activity and expression of genes that facilitate placental lipid transport suggest that enhanced placental lipid transport may play a key role in maternal nutrition and obesi-ty-induced fetal fat accumulation.", "journal": "Current molecular medicine", "date": "2023-06-07", "authors": ["NiralaSanjeev", "Xue-RuiTan", "MuhammadShafiq", "RajeshBasnet", "ApekshyaSingh"], "doi": "10.2174/1566524023666230605142119"}

Knowledge of the parasites crayfish harbor is limited, yet co-invasion of parasites is a significant risk associated with invasions. In this study, we describe a novel microsporidium, Cambaraspora faxoni n. sp. (Glugeida: Tuzetiidae), from two crayfish hosts in the Midwest USA, Faxonius virilis and Faxonius rusticus. We also expand the known host range of Cambaraspora floridanus to include Procambarus spiculifer.

The novel parasite was discovered within the native range of F. rusticus (Ohio, USA) and within a native congeneric (F. virilis) in the invasive range of F. rusticus (Wisconsin, USA). Faxonius virilis is invasive in other regions. This new parasite could have been introduced to Wisconsin with F. rusticus or it may be a generalist species with a broad distribution.

The mice were administered Rg5 via oral gavage for the last two weeks to investigate the potential mechanism of Rg5. RNA sequencing of heart tissues was performed for mechanistic studies. It was discovered that Rg5 inhibited cardiac inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, and hypertrophy, and prevented cardiac malfunction in mice challenged with Ang II, without altering blood pressure. RNA sequencing showed that Rg5's cardioprotective effect involves the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway. Rg5 diminished inflammation in mice hearts and cultured cardiomyocytes by blocking Ang II-activated JNK/AP-1 pathway. In the absence of JNK or AP-1 in cardiomyocytes, the anti-inflammatory effects of Rg5 were nullified.

To measure the level of B-catenin, c-MYC, GSK3B, and Bcl-2 proteins using the western blot method, cardiac pathological changes were measured using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson's trichrome and PAS staining and apoptosis using the TUNEL method.\nHistological results showed that diabetes causes significant pathological hypertrophy, fibrosis, and severe apoptosis in heart tissue. HIIT training significantly reduced pathological hypertrophy and fibrosis in heart tissue, and the rate of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was greatly reduced.

Therefore, we wanted to evaluate whether immature EHT (EHTIm) patches can be used for transplantation. Chronic myocardial injury was induced in a guinea pig model. EHTIm (15\u00d7106 cells) were transplanted within hours after casting. Cryo-injury led to large transmural scars amounting to 26% of the left ventricle. Grafts remuscularized 9% of the scar area on average. Echocardiographic analysis showed some evidence of improvement of left-ventricular function after EHTIm transplantation. In a small translational proof-of-concept study, human scale EHTIm patches (4.5\u00d7108 cells) were epicardially implanted on healthy pig hearts (n=2). In summary, we provide evidence that transplantation of EHTIm patches, i.e. without precultivation, is feasible, with similar engraftment results to those obtained using matured EHT.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2023-06-05", "authors": ["Constantinvon Bibra", "AyaShibamiya", "AndreaB\u00e4hr", "BirgitGeertz", "MariaK\u00f6hne", "TimStuedemann", "JuttaStarbatty", "VerenaHorneffer-van der Sluis", "Ulrich CKlostermeier", "NadjaHornaschewitz", "XinghaiLi", "EckhardWolf", "NikolaiKlymiuk", "MarkusKrane", "ChristianKupatt", "BernhardHiebl", "ThomasEschenhagen", "FlorianWeinberger"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.049834\n10.1371/journal.pone.0155676\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.054\n10.3791/58810\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/d41586-018-05278-8\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.10.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.008\n10.1038/srep19111\n10.1067/mje.2002.117560\n10.7759/cureus.9349\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120033\n10.1186/s41232-020-00149-0\n10.1038/s41598-017-14053-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047904\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.2.193\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.04.005\n10.1161/hc3601.094298\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1177/1074248413520344\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1016/j.stem.2018.01.015\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.01.007\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-031120-103629\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311504"}

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "The human heart is a pivotal organ in the circulatory system, and it beats more than 2 billion times during normal life. This functioning of the heart depends on the cardiac conduction system, which includes impulse generators (e.g., sino-atrial node) and the impulse propagating (His-Purkinje) system. \u00a0The sinoatrial node acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart. The cells present in the sinus node have innate automaticity, which starts the electrical activity in the heart. This innate electrical potential moves from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node and finally into the His-Purkinje system.\u00a0This movement of electric potential in an orderly manner controls the rhythmic contraction of the heart's chambers. The failure of this intrinsic electrical conduction in the heart can result in different arrhythmic problems. Several diseases and conditions affect the conduction system by involving impulse generation, impulse propagation, or both. Acquired conditions such as myocardial infarction, age-related degeneration, procedural complications, and drug toxicity are the major causes of the native conduction system malfunction.\u00a0 The current standard of care for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias due to conduction system diseases is the implantation of a cardiac implantable electronic device.\u00a0These pacing devices provide an external electrical stimulus that leads to depolarization of myocytes and helps maintain the electrical excitability of the heart tissue. This process leads to excitation-contraction coupling resulting in the contraction of myocardial tissue.\u00a0 Despite their success, electronic pacemakers have limitations, including complications related to implantation, limited battery life, the potential for infection, lack of physiologic autonomic responsiveness, and size restriction in younger patients.\u00a0The periodic evaluation of an implanted pacemaker is necessary to optimize programming and to identify correctable problems.

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in the United States with about 3 million people reported being diagnosed with the disorder.\u00a0The prevalence of atrial fibrillation dramatically increases with advancing age. As our population has enjoyed greater longevity, along with the increasing presence of risk factors known associated with atrial fibrillation such as hypertension and obesity, the incidence and prevalence of AF is expected to continue to increase. There is significant morbidity associated with the development and perpetuation of AF, including stroke, heart failure, cognitive impairment, renal failure, increased mortality\u00a0and a negative impact to\u00a0the quality of life.\u00a0As such, controlling the arrhythmia is often essential to patient quality of life and prognosis, but has been difficult to attain. Since Haussaiguarre et al. reported that AF most often began in the posterior left atrium surrounding the ostia of the pulmonary veins,\u00a0pulmonary vein electrical isolation via catheter ablation has been the cornerstone of nonpharmacological treatment of AF. Treatment of AF may be medical or surgical, depending on patient characteristics, duration of disease, symptoms, and patient preference. The two most frequently used energy sources used for ablation are electrocautery (known as\u00a0radio-frequency), and cryoenergy,;\u00a0although other energy sources are being actively investigated for their efficacy and safety. Both methods have been employed during open-heart surgery with equal efficacy.\u00a0Catheter\u00a0radiofrequency\u00a0ablation, where electrocautery is delivered to the tip of a steerable wire, has been used to treat cardiac arrhythmias since the 1980s.\u00a0Catheter cryoablation, where liquid nitrogen is introduced to scar arrhythmic cardiac tissue, was more recently introduced to deliver less severe burns and thus a more controlled degree of\u00a0injury.\u00a0It is most widely used in pediatrics due to the ability to reverse its effects if not applied for a long period due to its slow injury rate. As radio-frequency energy has been the primary energy source used to electrically isolate all four pulmonary veins,\u00a0an extensive number of ablation lesions\u00a0are needed to be delivered by wire to encircle the vein ostia. This posed a challenge of\u00a0completely encircling the peri-ostial pulmonary veins to produce complete conduction block, leaving gaps in the ablation lines and less control in the degree of\u00a0injury delivered, which could lead to injury to contiguous structures such as the esophagus.\u00a0In 2012 the FDA approved a multicenter examination of second-generation cryoballoon which is delivered through a catheter over a wire and can deliver a continuous encircling freeze lesion to the left atrial tissue surrounding the ostia of the pulmonary veins, thus being more consistent in ablation delivery and being less prone to gaps in the ablation field.\u00a0Cryoenergy's greater lesion control should also theoretically have less risk to injure deeper tissues and thus, safer.\u00a0A large multicenter trial in Europe showed both methods were equally effective in electrically isolating pulmonary veins and were equally effective in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation.\u00a0This activity reviews the methodology of catheter cryoballoon ablation using a multicenter examination of second-generation cryoballoon to treat symptomatic AF and its expected outcomes and risks.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["MenaYacoub", "Robert C.Sheppard"], "doi": null}

Among various factors contributing to heart failure, myocardial infarction is one of the most frequent and significant causes, which is still difficult to manage effectively. An innovative therapeutic strategy, namely a 3D bio-printed cardiac patch, has recently emerged as a promising approach to substitute damaged cardiomyocytes in a localized infarct region. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this treatment primarily relies on the long-term viability of the transplanted cells. In this study, we aimed to construct acoustically sensitive nano oxygen carriers to improve cell survival inside the bio-3D printed patch. In this study, we initially created nanodroplets capable of phase transition triggered by ultrasound and integrated them into GelMA (Gelatin Methacryloyl) hydrogels, which were then employed for 3D bioprinting. After adding nanodroplets and ultrasonic irradiation, numerous pores appeared inside the hydrogel with improved permeability. We further encapsulated hemoglobin into nanodroplets (ND-Hb) to construct oxygen carriers. Results of in vitro experiments showed the highest cell survival within the patch of ND-Hb irradiated by the low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) group. The genomic analysis discovered that the increased survival of seeded cells within the patch might be related to the protection of mitochondrial function owing to the improved hypoxic state. Eventually, in vivo studies revealed that the LIPUS+ND-Hb group had improved cardiac function and increased revascularization after myocardial infarction. To summarize, our study successfully improved the permeability of the hydrogel in a non-invasive and efficient manner, facilitating the exchange of substances in the cardiac patch. Moreover, ultrasound-controlled oxygen release augmented the viability of the transplanted cells and expedited the repair of infarcted tissues.", "journal": "International journal of biological macromolecules", "date": "2023-06-03", "authors": ["HaoWang", "YuxinGuo", "YugangHu", "YanxiangZhou", "YueyingChen", "XinHuang", "JinlingChen", "QingDeng", "ShengCao", "BoHu", "RiyueJiang", "JuhongPan", "TuantuanTan", "YijiaWang", "YunChen", "QiDong", "PuChen", "QingZhou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.125139"}

The mixture of exosomes+imipenem had the best function in reducing inflammation, maintaining all T lymphocyte populations, reducing liver damage, and ultimately increasing the survival rate.\nThe mixture of exosomes derived from MSCs and hepatocytes, along with imipenem, in the inflammatory phase of sepsis could be a promising therapeutic strategy in sepsis treatment.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2023-06-01", "authors": ["ArezouKhosrojerdi", "SaraSoudi", "Ahmad ZavaranHosseini", "Sahar GhaffariKhaligh", "Seyed MahmoudHashemi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121813"}

The present study wanted to discover the effect of sodium butyrate (NaB) and voluntary exercise, alone or together, on miR-126 and related proteins in rats with type 2 diabetes.\nthirty-five male Wistar rats (200-250\u00a0g) were randomly divided into five groups: control, diabetes, diabetes-NaB, diabetes-exercise, and diabetes-NaB-exercise. Type 2 diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (35\u00a0mg/kg) and high-fat diet. The rats were then administrated NaB (200\u00a0mg/kg. ip) or were subjected to voluntary exercise, or combined NaB and voluntary exercise for 8\u00a0weeks. MiR-126 expression in the cardiac tissue was determined by real-time PCR, and the SPRED-1 and RAF proteins expression levels were measured by western blot.\nNaB and voluntary exercise up-regulated cardiac miR-126 and RAF expression levels and down-regulated SPRED-1 in cardiac tissue of type 2 diabetic rats. Moreover, the combination of NaB and voluntary exercise amplified their effects on those parameters. Both NaB and voluntary exercise or together markedly modulated serum glucose and HbA1c.\nThe present findings demonstrated that NaB combined with exercise could improve cardiac angiogenesis by increasing miR-126 and affecting related proteins. Thus, NaB together with voluntary exercise might be a promising intervention for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.", "journal": "Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders", "date": "2023-05-31", "authors": ["HassanDariushnejad", "NedaRoshanravan", "LalePirzeh", "MostafaCheraghi", "VajiheGhorbanzadeh"], "doi": "10.1007/s40200-023-01198-1\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01857\n10.1007/s40139-020-00205-x\n10.1186/s12933-018-0703-2\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00228-5\n10.1080/14728222.2018.1420168\n10.1530/JOE-13-0544\n10.1007/s00592-016-0915-4\n10.1093/cvr/cvw235\n10.3390/ijms17060895\n10.1016/j.devcel.2008.07.008\n10.2174/1381612826666200504120737\n10.3748/wjg.v17.i12.1519\n10.1002/jcp.24871\n10.2337/db12-1354\n10.3390/nu12103209\n10.2337/db08-1637\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00762.2016\n10.1152/ajpendo.00466.2018\n10.1155/2008/704045\n10.2174/1570161117666190405165151\n10.1007/s10456-018-9632-7\n10.1155/2021/9935671\n10.1248/bpb.b22-00279\n10.1177/0300060520929170\n10.1186/s12933-016-0484-4\n10.1111/jcmm.15892\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.06.034\n10.1155/2022/4646245\n10.1021/acs.jafc.9b02083\n10.1152/ajpheart.00515.2019"}

Success was defined as freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia after a 3-month blanking period.\nFour hundred patients were included (56.5% men; 60.8% paroxysmal AF; age 70 [interquartile range, 59-77] years), 200 in each group (CB and PFA), and baseline characteristics did not differ. Acute PVI was achieved in 100% of PFA and in 98% (196/200) of CB patients (\nPFA compared with CB PVI shows a similar procedural efficacy but is associated with shorter procedure time and no phrenic nerve palsies.

Cardiovascular complications have considered as a major cause of high mortality in diabetic patients. Fucoidans from brown algae have diverse medicinal activities, however, few studies reported pharmacological activity of Sargassum. pallidum fucoidan (Sp-Fuc). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Sp-Fuc on diabetic symptoms and cardiac injury in spontaneous diabetic db/db mice. SP-Fuc at 200\u2009mg/(kg/d) was administered intragastrically to db/db mice for 8\u2009weeks, the effects on hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and cardiac damage, as well as oxidative stress, inflammation, Nrf2/ARE, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, were investigated. Our data demonstrated that Sp-Fuc significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) decreased body weights, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia in db/db mice, along with improved insulin sensitivity. Additionally, Sp-Fuc significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) alleviated cardiac dysfunction and pathological morphology of cardiac tissue. Sp-Fuc also significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) decreased lipid peroxidation, increased antioxidant function, as well as reduced cardiac inflammation, possibly through Nrf2/ARE and NF-\u03baB signaling. Sp-Fuc can ameliorate the metabolism disorders of glucose and lipid in diabetic mice by activating Nrf2/ARE antioxidant signaling, simultaneously reducing cardiac redox imbalance and inflammatory damage.

{"title": "Systematic discovery of transcription factors that improve hPSC-derived cardiomyocyte maturation via temporal analysis of bioengineered cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have the potential to become powerful tools for disease modeling, drug testing, and transplantation; however, their immaturity limits their applications. Transcription factor (TF) overexpression can improve hPSC-CM maturity, but identifying these TFs has been elusive. Toward this, we establish here an experimental framework for systematic identification of maturation enhancing factors. Specifically, we performed temporal transcriptome RNAseq analyses of progressively matured hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes across 2D and 3D differentiation systems and further compared these bioengineered tissues to native fetal and adult-derived tissues. These analyses revealed 22 TFs whose expression did not increase in 2D differentiation systems but progressively increased in 3D culture systems and adult mature cell types. Individually overexpressing each of these TFs in immature hPSC-CMs identified five TFs (KLF15, ZBTB20, ESRRA, HOPX, and CAMTA2) as regulators of calcium handling, metabolic function, and hypertrophy. Notably, the combinatorial overexpression of KLF15, ESRRA, and HOPX improved all three maturation parameters simultaneously. Taken together, we introduce a new TF cocktail that can be used in solo or in conjunction with other strategies to improve hPSC-CM maturation and anticipate that our generalizable methodology can also be implemented to identify maturation-associated TFs for other stem cell progenies.", "journal": "APL bioengineering", "date": "2023-05-30", "authors": ["AdityaKumar", "StarryHe", "PrashantMali"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0137458\n10.7759/cureus.9349\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs226\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.006\n10.1038/s41551-018-0344-5\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0247\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0275\n10.1002/adma.202200217\n10.1038/s41598-018-31848-x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044205\n10.1089/scd.2014.0533\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.10.001\n10.1063/1.5070106\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315862\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1038/s41598-019-45047-9\n10.7150/thno.19441\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.05.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311920\n10.1038/s41586-019-1415-9\n10.1038/s41467-018-07333-4\n10.3390/ijms22063288\n10.1016/j.stem.2018.09.009\n10.1038/s41467-019-12812-3\n10.1038/s41467-021-24743-z\n10.1093/nar/gkz881\n10.1186/s13287-019-1205-1\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1002/adhm.201800845\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1038/s41596-019-0189-8\n10.1007/s12551-021-00840-7\n10.1038/s41598-019-56597-3\n10.1098/rstb.2021.0325\n10.1186/s12864-018-5213-9\n10.1038/s41598-018-33837-6\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.051921\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.032\n10.1186/s13287-021-02252-6\n10.1016/j.stem.2022.02.011\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00165\n10.1038/s41467-021-23816-3\n10.1161/01.RES.0000074908.17214.FD\n10.3389/fphys.2021.718404\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321770\n10.3389/fcell.2020.594226\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1101/gr.240663.118\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.07.076\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042\n10.1038/s41598-020-68373-9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313249\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.099\n10.1074/jbc.M113.531384\n10.1155/2015/201625\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316100\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.08.013\n10.1038/nature10852\n10.3390/genes12030408\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311209\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.01.021\n10.1172/JCI8551\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.860171\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.04.002\n10.1016/j.cophys.2017.07.005\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00178\n10.3390/cells9010009\n10.1186/s13036-019-0185-0\n10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.662.36\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313973\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.04.021\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.01.024\n10.3389/fgene.2013.00088\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0119b.x\n10.7554/eLife.17304\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00118\n10.1101/135400\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.03.014\n10.1073/pnas.1814204116\n10.1063/1.5129347\n10.1093/nar/gkw377"}

{"title": "TLR4-A Pertinent Player in Radiation-Induced Heart Disease?", "abstract": "The heart is one of the organs that is sensitive to developing delayed adverse effects of ionizing radiation (IR) exposure. Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) occurs in cancer patients and cancer survivors, as a side effect of radiation therapy of the chest, with manifestation several years post-radiotherapy. Moreover, the continued threat of nuclear bombs or terrorist attacks puts deployed military service members at risk of exposure to total or partial body irradiation. Individuals who survive acute injury from IR will experience delayed adverse effects that include fibrosis and chronic dysfunction of organ systems such as the heart within months to years after radiation exposure. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an innate immune receptor that is implicated in several cardiovascular diseases. Studies in preclinical models have established the role of TLR4 as a driver of inflammation and associated cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction using transgenic models. This review explores the relevance of the TLR4 signaling pathway in radiation-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in acute as well as late effects on the heart tissue and the potential for the development of TLR4 inhibitors as a therapeutic target to treat or alleviate RIHD.", "journal": "Genes", "date": "2023-05-27", "authors": ["BasveshwarGawali", "VijayalakshmiSridharan", "Kimberly JKrager", "MarjanBoerma", "Snehalata APawar"], "doi": "10.3390/genes14051002\n10.1038/s41416-018-0201-z\n10.1007/s11886-017-0873-7\n10.3322/caac.21149\n10.1016/j.mrrev.2016.07.003\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.09.064\n10.3857/roj.2021.00766\n10.1053/j.seminoncol.2013.01.007\n10.4061/2011/317659\n10.1016/j.rpor.2019.12.015\n10.1200/JCO.2016.71.6142\n10.1016/0360-3016(91)90171-Y\n10.1667/RR2629.1\n10.1667/RR3049\n10.1667/RR2746.1\n10.1177/0146645316629318\n10.1080/09553002.2021.1876955\n10.1136/bmj.b5349\n10.1667/RADE-22-00132.1\n10.1667/RR1070.1\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.08.071\n10.1093/ije/29.4.708\n10.18632/oncotarget.10424\n10.1056/NEJMoa1209825\n10.3322/caac.21342\n10.14219/jada.archive.2003.0108\n10.1200/JCO.2004.09.109\n10.1016/j.radonc.2012.02.008\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00083\n10.3389/fonc.2015.00039\n10.1080/09553002.2021.1956007\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00759-9\n10.1155/2018/9874109\n10.1200/JCO.2016.69.8480\n10.1200/JCO.2015.63.4444\n10.4330/wjc.v8.i9.504\n10.1155/2020/3579143\n10.1007/s00392-021-01809-y\n10.1097/MD.0000000000005932\n10.1152/ajpheart.00124.2017\n10.1093/jnci/djv008\n10.1007/s12094-017-1828-6\n10.1089/ars.2013.5769\n10.1016/j.canlet.2011.12.012\n10.1023/B:CANC.0000031769.14728.bc\n10.2174/092986709787002790\n10.1152/physrev.00029.2006\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2004.02.018\n10.1007/s00018-018-2956-z\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.01.014\n10.4061/2011/259462\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00020\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109560\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.06.004\n10.1038/onc.2014.145\n10.1016/j.tox.2014.07.002\n10.3109/08830185.2012.706761\n10.1038/cddis.2016.140\n10.1172/JCI6709\n10.1155/2018/3181278\n10.1016/j.taap.2018.05.011\n10.1111/jcmm.12659\n10.1371/journal.pone.0193844\n10.1371/journal.pone.0120175\n10.1007/s12026-022-09290-z\n10.4110/in.2018.18.e27\n10.1038/nri2873\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.820962\n10.1002/0471142735.im1412s109\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00573.x\n10.1084/jem.20081370\n10.1126/science.1093620\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.306474\n10.1093/intimm/dxh186\n10.4049/jimmunol.0800861\n10.1084/jem.20050630\n10.1128/IAI.73.5.2940-2950.2005\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.12.8280\n10.1182/blood-2014-10-608653\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.01.062\n10.1155/2021/9594607\n10.1038/s41418-017-0036-9\n10.1074/jbc.M113.462341\n10.1007/s00380-013-0421-3\n10.1155/2018/4302726\n10.1002/ctm2.266\n10.1074/jbc.M115.661835\n10.1111/jcmm.14626\n10.1016/S1471-4906(02)02317-7\n10.1007/s11926-014-0474-z\n10.1086/374749\n10.1126/science.1085536\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2011.00274.x\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2006.03.005\n10.1007/s00395-006-0597-0\n10.1097/SHK.0b013e318235805f\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.02.020\n10.12659/MSM.881709\n10.1038/labinvest.3700031\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.06.023\n10.1161/01.RES.0000144175.70140.8c\n10.3109/10799893.2014.993649\n10.3389/fphys.2021.712338\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.015\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.08.012\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02982.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.158220\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.498865\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.01.006\n10.1159/000477889\n10.3390/ijms24065374\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.579036\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.00719\n10.1038/s41598-020-75301-4\n10.1371/annotation/e82f77a8-3d29-44be-a9ef-7abc6c7e584a\n10.1186/s12979-021-00251-y\n10.1007/s12035-013-8425-7\n10.1093/cvr/cvu067\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000112575.66565.84\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.01.010\n10.1155/2022/2466150\n10.3390/cancers12020415\n10.1016/j.radonc.2021.01.023\n10.3389/fonc.2022.920867\n10.1097/hp.0000000000000357\n10.1016/bs.mcb.2021.12.016\n10.1093/toxsci/kfz103\n10.1016/j.trsl.2021.06.002\n10.1111/jcmm.14703\n10.1667/RR13630.1\n10.3389/fcimb.2022.831387\n10.2147/JIR.S384279\n10.1371/journal.pone.0252142\n10.3390/cancers15020406\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2014.07.007\n10.1016/j.canlet.2015.03.031\n10.1177/1753944717729141\n10.1007/s00109-021-02113-y\n10.1084/jem.173.5.1177\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135388\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033044\n10.1667/RR2657.1\n10.26355/eurrev_201801_14097\n10.1186/s13287-022-02945-6\n10.18632/oncotarget.17859\n10.1038/s41598-020-73946-9\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.10.053\n10.1111/j.1442-2050.2007.00794.x\n10.1259/bjr/33094251"}
{"title": "Characterization of Experimentally Observed Complex Interplay between Pulse Duration, Electrical Field Strength, and Cell Orientation on Electroporation Outcome Using a Time-Dependent Nonlinear Numerical Model.", "abstract": "Electroporation is a biophysical phenomenon involving an increase in cell membrane permeability to molecules after a high-pulsed electric field is applied to the tissue. Currently, electroporation is being developed for non-thermal ablation of cardiac tissue to treat arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes have been shown to be more affected by electroporation when oriented with their long axis parallel to the applied electric field. However, recent studies demonstrate that the preferentially affected orientation depends on the pulse parameters. To gain better insight into the influence of cell orientation on electroporation with different pulse parameters, we developed a time-dependent nonlinear numerical model where we calculated the induced transmembrane voltage and pores creation in the membrane due to electroporation. The numerical results show that the onset of electroporation is observed at lower electric field strengths for cells oriented parallel to the electric field for pulse durations \u226510 \u00b5s, and cells oriented perpendicular for pulse durations ~100 ns. For pulses of ~1 \u00b5s duration, electroporation is not very sensitive to cell orientation. Interestingly, as the electric field strength increases beyond the onset of electroporation, perpendicular cells become more affected irrespective of pulse duration. The results obtained using the developed time-dependent nonlinear model are corroborated by in vitro experimental measurements. Our study will contribute to the process of further development and optimization of pulsed-field ablation and gene therapy in cardiac treatments.", "journal": "Biomolecules", "date": "2023-05-27", "authors": ["MariaScuderi", "JanjaDermol-\u010cerne", "TinaBatista Napotnik", "SebastienChaigne", "OlivierBernus", "DavidBenoist", "Daniel CSigg", "LeaRems", "DamijanMiklav\u010di\u010d"], "doi": "10.3390/biom13050727\n10.3390/jcm10122657\n10.1111/jce.14414\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.063988\n10.1016/j.eupc.2005.04.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014467\n10.1038/gt.2016.35\n10.1007/s00232-010-9279-9\n10.1073/pnas.74.5.1923\n10.1146/annurev-biophys-052118-115451\n10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76325-9\n10.1007/s10439-005-9076-2\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.1152/physrev.00037.2015\n10.1016/j.echo.2006.10.013\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1002/jcu.23316\n10.1155/2012/891070\n10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004133\n10.1007/s10439-020-02525-w\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.690092\n10.4149/gpb_2015047\n10.1109/TBME.2008.2001135\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2010.01863.x\n10.1089/bioe.2019.0030\n10.1038/s41598-018-26521-2\n10.4070/kcj.2023.0023\n10.1007/s11886-021-01630-z\n10.1007/s11517-019-02054-2\n10.1038/s41598-020-65830-3\n10.1021/ac1019649\n10.1161/CIRCEP.122.011131\n10.1007/s00232-016-9907-0\n10.1529/biophysj.107.121921\n10.1038/srep03382\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)76973-0\n10.1529/biophysj.106.094235\n10.1016/S0302-4598(97)00093-7\n10.1113/jphysiol.1966.sp007823\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2017.12.005\n10.1016/S0022-0736(95)80052-2\n10.1109/10.923781\n10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81550-9\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.09.017\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2167232\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2022.108216\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2018.07.018\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2021.107869\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2017.09.005\n10.1016/j.bpj.2020.05.030\n10.1016/S0006-3495(90)82451-6\n10.1007/s00232-017-9962-1\n10.2478/raon-2020-0047\n10.1007/s00232-017-9981-y\n10.1073/pnas.0405905101\n10.1063/1.5079292\n10.3390/cancers12051132\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2021.107871\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2466234\n10.1016/j.jacep.2022.03.007\n10.1093/europace/euz341\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2021.06.605\n10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010375\n10.1056/NEJM199809033391003\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00490-X\n10.1161/01.RES.52.2.188\n10.1161/01.RES.82.1.63\n10.1038/gt.2012.15"}

{"title": "Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Attenuates Myocardial Dysfunction via Inhibition of Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue damage following ischemia leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an active polyphenol flavonoid or catechin, exerts bioactivity in tissues with various diseases and protects ischemic myocardium; however, its association with the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is unknown. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) pretreated with transforming growth factor \u03b22 (TGF-\u03b22) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) were treated with EGCG to verify cellular function. In addition, EGCG is involved in RhoA GTPase transmission, resulting in reduced cell mobility, oxidative stress, and inflammation-related factors. A mouse myocardial infarction (MI) model was used to confirm the association between EGCG and EndMT in vivo. In the EGCG-treated group, ischemic tissue was regenerated by regulating proteins involved in the EndMT process, and cardioprotection was induced by positively regulating apoptosis and fibrosis of cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, EGCG can reactivate myocardial function due to EndMT inhibition. In summary, our findings confirm that EGCG is an impact activator controlling the cardiac EndMT process derived from ischemic conditions and suggest that supplementation with EGCG may be beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", "journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-05-27", "authors": ["SejinKim", "HyunjaeLee", "HanbyeolMoon", "RanKim", "MinsukKim", "SeongtaeJeong", "HojinKim", "Sang HyeonKim", "Soo SeokHwang", "Min YoungLee", "JongminKim", "Byeong-WookSong", "WoochulChang"], "doi": "10.3390/antiox12051059\n10.3390/md20120756\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.025\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306565\n10.4330/wjc.v6.i6.462\n10.1038/s41598-022-05632-x\n10.3390/nu11081911\n10.3892/etm.2014.2135\n10.1016/j.redox.2013.12.022\n10.3390/nu12103155\n10.1016/j.phymed.2013.01.006\n10.3390/nu15010037\n10.1038/s41598-022-21107-5\n10.3390/ijms24010340\n10.1038/s12276-021-00584-0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.089\n10.33549/physiolres.934780\n10.1038/s41467-021-20905-1\n10.5483/BMBRep.2020.53.11.177\n10.3390/ijms18112290\n10.3390/ijms17050761\n10.5483/BMBRep.2014.47.6.085\n10.1126/sciadv.adc9465\n10.1161/JAHA.121.023695\n10.1038/srep41932\n10.7554/eLife.57920\n10.1111/jcmm.12895\n10.1016/j.imbio.2012.05.026\n10.5483/BMBRep.2018.51.2.011\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.11.114\n10.1093/cvr/cvx253\n10.1093/jb/mvr121\n10.1038/labinvest.2014.100\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101593\n10.7554/eLife.43882\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00260\n10.1177/1074248420952233\n10.1016/j.tips.2017.03.001\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.734550\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.07.734\n10.5483/BMBRep.2017.50.7.085\n10.1016/j.jlr.2021.100066\n10.1096/fj.04-1716fje\n10.1155/2020/6381380\n10.2174/1381612825666190722100504\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.658400\n10.1007/s00394-019-01920-x\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00294\n10.1159/000358702\n10.3892/etm.2020.8827\n10.4097/kjae.2010.58.2.169\n10.3390/ijms12095592"}
{"title": "Osthole Prevents Heart Damage Induced by Diet-Induced Metabolic Syndrome: Role of Fructokinase (KHK).", "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that either ingested or produced fructose may have a role in metabolic syndrome. While not commonly considered a criterion for metabolic syndrome, cardiac hypertrophy is often associated with metabolic syndrome, and its presence carries increased cardiovascular risk. Recently it has been shown that fructose and fructokinase C (KHK) can be induced in cardiac tissue. Here we tested whether diet-induced metabolic syndrome causes heart disease associated with increased fructose content and metabolism and whether it can be prevented with a fructokinase inhibitor (osthole). Male Wistar rats were provided a control diet (C) or high fat/sugar diet for 30 days (MS), with half of the latter group receiving osthol (MS+OT, 40 mg/kg/d). The Western diet increased fructose, uric acid, and triglyceride concentrations in cardiac tissue associated with cardiac hypertrophy, local hypoxia, oxidative stress, and increased activity and expression of KHK in cardiac tissue. Osthole reversed these effects. We conclude that the cardiac changes in metabolic syndrome involve increased fructose content and its metabolism and that blocking fructokinase can provide cardiac benefit through the inhibition of KHK with modulation of hypoxia, oxidative stress, hypertrophy, and fibrosis.", "journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-05-27", "authors": ["Fernando EGarc\u00eda-Arroyo", "GuillermoGonzaga-S\u00e1nchez", "AlejandroSilva-Palacios", "Francisco JavierRold\u00e1n", "Mar\u00eda LLoredo-Mendoza", "Yamnia QuetzalAlvarez-Alvarez", "Jesus Ade Los Santos Coyotl", "Kevin AV\u00e9lez Orozco", "EdiliaTapia", "HoracioOsorio-Alonso", "Abraham SArellano-Buend\u00eda", "Jos\u00e9 LS\u00e1nchez-Gloria", "Miguel ALanaspa", "Richard JJohnson", "Laura GabrielaS\u00e1nchez-Lozada"], "doi": "10.3390/antiox12051023\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.01.001\n10.3389/fphar.2021.695486\n10.1016/j.jhep.2018.01.019\n10.1016/j.nut.2009.08.017\n10.1155/2019/3218275\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.02.011\n10.1038/nature14508\n10.3390/ijms22052431\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.108296\n10.1016/j.exger.2017.06.009\n10.1007/s00395-006-0627-y\n10.1016/0003-2697(72)90042-5\n10.1681/ASN.2008060576\n10.1073/pnas.1422448112\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.07.018\n10.1016/0003-2697(69)90064-5\n10.1038/s41387-021-00150-7\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.101875\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.108625\n10.1002/hep.26594\n10.3390/ijms24054551\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.04.051\n10.1142/S0192415X22500240\n10.1155/2016/8598253\n10.3390/nu11092090\n10.1016/j.mam.2008.05.005\n10.1016/j.tibs.2014.02.002\n10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101196\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.11.007"}

This study aims to evaluate the impact of critical biomanufacturing decisions-namely cell dose, hydrogel composition, and size-on ECT formation and function-through the lens of clinical translation. ECTs were fabricated by mixing human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and human cardiac fibroblasts into a collagen hydrogel to engineer meso-(3 \u00d7 9 mm), macro- (8 \u00d7 12 mm), and mega-ECTs (65 \u00d7 75 mm). Meso-ECTs exhibited a hiPSC-CM dose-dependent response in structure and mechanics, with high-density ECTs displaying reduced elastic modulus, collagen organization, prestrain development, and active stress generation. Scaling up, cell-dense macro-ECTs were able to follow point stimulation pacing without arrhythmogenesis. Finally, we successfully fabricated a mega-ECT at clinical scale containing 1 billion hiPSC-CMs for implantation in a swine model of chronic myocardial ischemia to demonstrate the technical feasibility of biomanufacturing, surgical implantation, and engraftment. Through this iterative process, we define the impact of manufacturing variables on ECT formation and function as well as identify challenges that must still be overcome to successfully accelerate ECT clinical translation.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-05-27", "authors": ["Kiera DDwyer", "Rajeev JKant", "Arvin HSoepriatna", "Stephanie MRoser", "Mark CDaley", "Sharif ASabe", "Cynthia MXu", "Bum-RakChoi", "Frank WSellke", "Kareen L KCoulombe"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering10050587\n10.1038/nbt1117\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029343\n10.1038/nm1618\n10.1111/joic.12508\n10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100674\n10.1007/BF03091790\n10.1002/ehf2.13144\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000172\n10.1161/JAHA.115.002667\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.069\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.869123\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047904\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.10.005\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1371/journal.pone.0230001\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.06.001\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1155/2020/9363809\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0068\n10.1089/ten.tec.2018.0379\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107925\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01112\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312067\n10.1098/rsif.2019.0028\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.10.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0280406\n10.1007/978-1-0716-2261-2_10\n10.1007/s12195-021-00703-x\n10.1161/JAHA.122.028623\n10.3390/ijms24032076\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2021.07.062\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2022.09.019\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.11.150\n10.1161/JAHA.120.017437\n10.1371/journal.pone.0238879\n10.1161/JAHA.119.012617\n10.1161/JAHA.117.008344\n10.1016/j.surg.2016.11.009\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.08.101\n10.1016/j.surg.2015.03.034\n10.1172/JCI117378\n10.1161/01.cir.0000087903.75204.ad\n10.1016/j.surg.2004.05.017\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.04.005\n10.1038/s41598-020-76163-6\n10.1128/IAI.73.4.1907-1916.2005\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00384-3\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.3390/jpm11050374\n10.1038/s41467-021-23329-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306985\n10.24175/sbd.2017.000004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.03.037\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120033\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.01.002\n10.1101/2022.07.07.499077\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/srep45641\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.950829\n10.1096/fasebj.14.5.669\n10.1002/stem.2732\n10.1073/pnas.0900174106\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.12.015\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00255-2\n10.1053/j.semtcvs.2005.09.006\n10.1016/S0003-4975(02)03747-5\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2010.02.007\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2004.09.009\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124545\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1016/j.bpj.2018.08.050\n10.1152/ajpheart.00799.2013\n10.1021/acsami.9b02446\n10.3390/polym14214571\n10.1115/1.4044030\n10.1002/bit.27582\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1002/bit.25185\n10.1002/admt.201900820\n10.1039/C7BM00323D\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0213\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.08.036\n10.1038/s41551-019-0380-9\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.09.012\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.017\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.05.022\n10.1038/s41598-021-87186-y\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.11.020\n10.1093/stcltm/szac061\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.053563\n10.1038/s42004-019-0154-z\n10.5966/sctm.2013-0202\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208991\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.097\n10.3389/fcell.2021.670504\n10.1038/s41587-019-0016-3\n10.1073/pnas.2022091118"}

{"title": "Gelatin nanofibers: Recent insights in synthesis, bio-medical applications and limitations.", "abstract": "The use of gelatin and gelatin-blend polymers as environmentally safe polymers to synthesis electrospun nanofibers, has caused a revolution in the biomedical field. The development of efficient nanofibers has played a significant role in drug delivery, and for use in advanced scaffolds in regenerative medicine. Gelatin is an exceptional biopolymer, which is highly versatile, despite variations in the processing technology. The electrospinning process is an efficient technique for the manufacture of gelatin electrospun nanofibers (GNFs), as it is simple, efficient, and cost-effective. GNFs have higher porosity with large surface area and biocompatibility, despite that there are some drawbacks. These drawbacks include rapid degradation, poor mechanical strength, and complete dissolution, which limits the use of gelatin electrospun nanofibers in this form for biomedicine. Thus, these fibers need to be cross-linked, in order to control its solubility. This modification caused an improvement in the biological properties of GNFs, which made them suitable candidates for various biomedical applications, such as wound healing, drug delivery, bone regeneration, tubular scaffolding, skin, nerve, kidney, and cardiac tissue engineering.

In a proof-of-principle approach, the sensitivity of the method was tested by analyzing substrate metabolism in the remote myocardium after myocardial infarction (I/R).\nHere, I/R increased uncoupled OCR compared with sham animals indicating a stimulated metabolic capacity.

As cardiac arrhythmias caused by AF are a major global health concern, we investigated whether SHP-1 modulates AF development. The degree of atrial fibrosis was examined using Masson's trichrome staining, and SHP-1 expression in the human atrium was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and western blotting (WB). We also examined SHP-1 expression in cardiac tissue from an AF mouse model, as well as in angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated mouse atrial myocytes and fibroblasts. We found that SHP-1 expression was reduced with the aggravation of atrial fibrosis in clinical samples of patients with AF. SHP-1 was also downregulated in the heart tissue of AF mice and Ang II-treated myocytes and fibroblasts, compared with that in the control groups. Next, we demonstrated that SHP-1 overexpression alleviated AF severity in mice by injecting a lentiviral vector into the pericardial space. In Ang II-treated myocytes and fibroblasts, we observed excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21)/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2) pathway activation, all of which were counteracted by the overexpression of SHP-1. Our WB data showed that STAT3 activation was inversely correlated with SHP-1 expression in samples from patients with AF, AF mice, and Ang II-treated cells. Furthermore, administration of colivelin, a STAT3 agonist, in SHP-1-overexpressing, Ang II-treated myocytes and fibroblasts resulted in higher levels of ECM deposition, ROS generation, and TGF-\u03b21/SMAD2 activation.

{"title": "Spatiotemporal estimations of temperature rise during electroporation treatments using a deep neural network.", "abstract": "The nonthermal mechanism for irreversible electroporation has been paramount for treating tumors and cardiac tissue in anatomically sensitive areas, where there is concern about damage to nearby bowels, ducts, blood vessels, or nerves. However, Joule heating still occurs as a secondary effect of applying current through a resistive tissue and must be minimized to maintain the benefits of electroporation at high voltages. Numerous thermal mitigation protocols have been proposed to minimize temperature rise, but intraoperative temperature monitoring is still needed. We show that an accurate and robust temperature prediction AI model can be developed using estimated tissue properties (bulk and dynamic conductivity), known geometric properties (probe spacing), and easily measurable treatment parameters (applied voltage, current, and pulse number). We develop the 2-layer neural network on realistic 2D finite element model simulations with conditions encompassing most electroporation applications. Calculating feature contributions, we found that temperature prediction is mostly dependent on current and pulse number and show that the model remains accurate when incorrect tissue properties are intentionally used as input parameters. Lastly, we show that the model can predict temperature rise within ex vivo perfused porcine livers, with error <0.5\u00a0\u00b0C. This model, using easily acquired parameters, is shown to predict temperature rise in over 1000 unique test conditions with <1\u00a0\u00b0C error and no observable outliers.

Through repetition, electrophysiologists and interventional cardiologists experienced in TP develop manual skills to navigate the transseptal catheter assembly to their target on the fossa ovalis (FO). Cardiology fellows and cardiologists that are new to TP currently train on patients to develop this skill, resulting in increased risk of complications. The goal of this work was to create low-risk training opportunities for new TP operators.\nWe developed a Soft Active Transseptal Puncture Simulator (SATPS), designed to match the dynamics, static response, and visualization of the heart during TP. The SATPS includes three subsystems: (i) A soft robotic right atrium with pneumatic actuators mimics the dynamics of a beating heart. (ii) A fossa ovalis insert simulates cardiac tissue properties. (iii) A simulated intracardiac echocardiography environment provides live visual feedback. Subsystem performance was verified with benchtop tests. Face and content validity were evaluated by experienced clinicians.\nSubsystems accurately represented atrial volume displacement, tenting and puncture force, and FO deformation. Passive and active actuation states were deemed suitable for simulating different cardiac conditions. Participants rated the SATPS as realistic and useful for training cardiology fellows in TP.\nThe SATPS can help improve catheterization skills of novice TP operators.\nThe SATPS could provide novice TP operators the opportunity to improve their TP skills before operating on a patient for the first time, reducing the likelihood of complications.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2023-05-23", "authors": ["Nicholas AThompson", "SanghyunShin", "Abraham GKocheril", "Elizabeth THsiao-Wecksler", "GirishKrishnan"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2023.3278651"}
{"title": "New Metric to Evaluate Cardiac Anisotropic Mechanics by Directional High-Frequency Ultrasound-Based Transverse Wave Elastography.", "abstract": "The evaluation of cardiac anisotropic mechanics is important in the diagnosis of heart disease. However, other representative ultrasound imaging-based metrics, which are capable of quantitatively evaluating anisotropic cardiac mechanics, are insufficient for accurately diagnosing heart disease due to the influence of viscosity and geometry of cardiac tissues. In this study, we propose a new ultrasound imaging-based metric, maximum cosine similarity (MaxCosim), for quantifying anisotropic mechanics of cardiac tissues by evaluating the periodicity of the transverse wave speeds depending on the measurement directions using ultrasound imaging. We developed a high-frequency ultrasound-based directional transverse wave imaging system to measure the transverse wave speed in multiple directions. The ultrasound imaging-based metric was validated by performing experiments on 40 rats randomly assigned to four groups; three doxorubicin (DOX) treatment groups received 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg DOX, while the control group received 0.2 mL/kg saline. In each heart sample, the developed ultrasound imaging system allowed measuring transverse wave speeds in multiple directions, and the new metric was then calculated from 3-D ultrasound transverse wave images to evaluate the degree of anisotropic mechanics of the heart sample. The results of the metric were compared with histopathological changes for validation. A decrease in the MaxCosim value was observed in the DOX treatment groups, with the degree of decrease depending on the dose. These results are consistent with the histopathological features, suggesting that our ultrasound imaging-based metric can quantify the anisotropic mechanics of cardiac tissues and potentially be used for the early diagnosis of heart disease.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2023-05-23", "authors": ["SeungyeopLee", "Lucy YoungminEun", "Jae YounHwang", "Jung-SunKim", "YongsoonEun"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2023.3279284"}
{"title": "Sex- and age-related differences in renal and cardiac injury and senescence in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.", "abstract": "Sex differences play a critical role in the incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases, whereby men are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to age-matched premenopausal women. Marked sex differences at the cellular and tissue level may contribute to susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and end-organ damage. In this study, we have performed an in-depth histological analysis of sex differences in hypertensive cardiac and renal injury in middle-aged stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) to determine the interaction between age, sex and cell senescence.\nKidneys, hearts and urine samples were collected from 6.5- and 8-month-old (Mo) male and female SHRSPs. Urine samples were assayed for albumin and creatinine content. Kidneys and hearts were screened for a suite of cellular senescence markers (senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase, p16\nMarked renal and cardiac fibrosis, concomitant with albuminuria, were evident in all SHRSPs. These sequelae were differentially affected by age, sex and organ. That is, the level of fibrosis was greater in the kidney than the heart, males had greater levels of fibrosis than females in both the heart and kidney, and even a 6-week increase in age resulted in greater levels of kidney fibrosis in males. The differences in kidney fibrosis were reflected by elevated levels of cellular senescence in the kidney in males but not females. Senescent cell burden was significantly less in cardiac tissue compared to renal tissue and was not affected by age or sex.\nOur study demonstrates a clear sex pattern in age-related progression of renal and cardiac fibrosis and cellular senescence in SHRSP rats. A 6-week time frame was associated with increased indices of cardiac and renal fibrosis and cellular senescence in male SHRSPs. Female SHRSP rats were protected from renal and cardiac damage compared to age-matched males. Thus, the SHRSP is an ideal model to investigate the effects of sex and aging on organ injury over a short timeframe.\nKidney and cardiovascular diseases are some of the leading causes of death worldwide, and they affect men and women differently. Young men are generally at higher risk of developing these diseases than young women. Women also have unique risk factors for kidney and cardiovascular disease. These may include complications associated with pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, and menopause. For example, the risk of disease for women increases significantly after menopause. In addition, treatment strategies for kidney and cardiovascular diseases are often less effective in women compared to men, but the causes for this are unknown. More research is needed to understand sex differences in kidney and cardiovascular diseases, so that we can develop new drugs that are effective in women as well as men. In this study, we have examined kidney and heart damage associated with elevated blood pressure in adult male rats and adult female rats (long before the onset of menopause). We have shown that males develop significantly more scarring of their hearts and kidneys compared to females. We also identified the cells in the kidneys of male rats, but not female rats, showed signs of DNA damage and early ageing. This suggests cellular damage in young males may contribute to their more rapid progression of kidney disease compared to females. Future research examining females after menopause, when disease risk is greater, will enhance our understanding of cell damage in kidney and cardiovascular disease.", "journal": "Biology of sex differences", "date": "2023-05-23", "authors": ["AneesaAnsari", "Sarah LWalton", "Kate MDenton"], "doi": "10.1186/s13293-023-00519-6\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00527-2\n10.1001/jama.287.8.1003\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000194118.35098.43\n10.1038/nrneph.2017.189\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000351\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000485\n10.1002/advs.202002611\n10.1681/ASN.2018121251\n10.1111/acel.13094\n10.1093/ije/dyv165\n10.1016/j.exger.2015.11.009\n10.1042/CS20201017\n10.1161/HYP.0000000000000090\n10.1538/expanim.53.67\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328362f9a5\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.10593\n10.1038/s41598-017-17204-5\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.005\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2006.00199.x\n10.1161/01.STR.7.1.46\n10.1161/JAHA.119.014142\n10.1006/exmp.1997.2218\n10.1161/01.HYP.35.4.908\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.9.3164\n10.34067/KID.0002722021\n10.1172/JCI117531\n10.1002/ar.1092320205\n10.1172/jci.insight.99271\n10.1038/nrneph.2012.198\n10.1152/physrev.00055.2006\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.00874.x\n10.1016/S2213-8587(18)30314-0\n10.1152/ajprenal.00226.2004\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328352b89a\n10.1016/j.amjhyper.2004.12.014\n10.1038/s41598-020-73974-5\n10.1152/ajprenal.00079.2007\n10.1093/cvr/cvp350\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2022.08.014\n10.1038/s41591-018-0092-9\n10.1152/ajprenal.00609.2020\n10.1681/ASN.2017050574\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2019.05.002\n10.1038/ncb2466\n10.1038/s41596-021-00505-5\n10.3389/fcell.2021.623175\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00481.x\n10.1007/s40520-015-0464-7\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e32835ba77e\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000001770\n10.1172/JCI95148\n10.1161/JAHA.119.012584\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.099432\n10.1126/science.1122446\n10.1091/mbc.e09-01-0085\n10.5551/jat.47993\n10.7150/ijbs.25783\n10.1016/j.exger.2010.09.012"}

Oxidative stress was parallel to microstructural cell damage (e.g., increased cardiac toponin I levels) and contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo, whose severity accompanied a premature cellular senescence-like phenotype revealed by increased senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) activity and DNA oxidation (8-OHdG). Cellular parasitism (e.g., infection rate and parasite load), myocarditis and T. cruzi-induced prooxidant responses were attenuated by early BZN administration to interrupt the progression of T. cruzi infection, protecting against SA-\u03b2-gal-based premature cellular senescence, microstructural damage and contractile deterioration in cardiomyocytes from T. cruzi-infected animals.\nOur findings indicated that cell parasitism, redox imbalance and contractile dysfunction were correlated to SA-\u03b2-Gal-based cardiomyocytes premature senescence in acute T. cruzi infection.

{"title": "IRG1 prevents excessive inflammatory responses and cardiac dysfunction after myocardial injury.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) and chemotherapeutic drug administration can induce myocardial damage and cardiomyocyte cell death, and trigger the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that initiate the aseptic inflammatory response. The moderate inflammatory response is beneficial for repairing damaged myocardium, while an excessive inflammatory response exacerbates myocardial injury, promotes scar formation, and results in a poor prognosis of cardiac diseases. Immune responsive gene 1 (IRG1) is specifically highly expressed in activated macrophages and mediates the production of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolite itaconate. However, the role of IRG1 in the inflammation and myocardial injury of cardiac stress-related diseases remains unknown. Here, we found that IRG1 knockout mice exhibited increased cardiac tissue inflammation and infarct size, aggravated myocardial fibrosis, and impaired cardiac function after MI and in vivo doxorubicin (Dox) administration. Mechanically, IRG1 deficiency enhanced the production of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 by suppressing the nuclear factor red lineage 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) pathway in cardiac macrophages. Importantly, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), a cell-permeable derivative of itaconate, reversed the inhibited expression of NRF2 and ATF3 caused by IRG1 deficiency. Moreover, in vivo 4-OI administration inhibited the cardiac inflammation and fibrosis, and prevented adverse ventricle remodeling in IRG1 knockout mice with MI or Dox-induced myocardial injury.

The treatment of sepsis myocardial injury (SMI) has been the focus of clinical medicine. Salidroside shows myocardial cell protection, anti-oxidation and anti- inflammation effects, and it is thought as one of the potential compounds to treat sepsis myocardial injury. However, its anti-inflammatory activity is lower and its pharmacokinetic properties are not ideal, which is far from clinical application. Here, a series of salidroside analogs were synthesized, and their bioactivities were evaluated from several aspects, including their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and anti-sepsis myocardial injury activities in vivo. Of all the compounds which synthesized, compounds 2 and 3 exhibited stronger anti-inflammatory activities than the others; after treating LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 or H9c2 cells with each of them, the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. In the anti-oxidative stress injury test, compounds 2 and 3 not only markedly increased the survival rate of cells, and but also improved the cellular oxidative stress-related indicators MDA, SOD and cell damage marker LDH in a dose-dependent manner. In the LPS-induced septic rat myocardial injury models (in vivo), the two compounds also showed good bioactivities. They also reduced the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and blocked cell damage by suppressing overhauled oxidation in septic rats. In addition, the myocardial injury was significantly improved and the inflammatory infiltration was reduced after treatment with the two compounds.

However, there is difficulty in obtaining and maintaining a system that allows researchers to study physiologically relevant cardiac development, maturation, and drug screening due to the issues around inconsistent contractions of cardiomyocytes. Butterfly wings have special nanostructures arranged in parallel, which could help generate the alignment of cardiomyocytes to better mimic the natural heart tissue structure. Here, we construct a conduction-consistent human cardiac muscle patch by assembling human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) on graphene oxide (GO) modified butterfly wings. We also show this system functions as a versatile model to study human cardiomyogenesis by assembling human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (hiPSC-CPCs) on the GO modified butterfly wings. The GO modified butterfly wing platform facilitated the parallel orientation of hiPSC-CMs, enhanced relative maturation as well as improved conduction consistency of the cardiomyocytes. In addition, GO modified butterfly wings enhanced the proliferation and maturation characteristics of the hiPSC-CPCs. In accordance with data obtained from RNA-sequencing and gene signatures, assembling hiPSC-CPCs on GO modified butterfly wings stimulated the differentiation of the progenitors into relatively mature hiPSC-CMs. These characteristics and capabilities of GO modified butterfly wings make them an ideal platform for heart research and drug screening.", "journal": "Bioengineering & translational medicine", "date": "2023-05-19", "authors": ["YaoTan", "TingtingLu", "YingChen", "NevinWitman", "BingqianYan", "LiYang", "MingluLiu", "YiqiGong", "XuefengAi", "RunjiaoLuo", "HuijingWang", "WeiWang", "WeiFu"], "doi": "10.1002/btm2.10522"}

{"title": "Summation of activation at the branch-stem transition of Mimosa pudica; a comparison with summation in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "In Mimosa pudica plants, local and global responses to environmental stimuli are associated with different types of electrical activity. Non-damaging stimuli (e.g. cooling) generate action potentials (APs), whereas damaging stimuli (e.g. heating) are associated with variation potentials (VPs). Local cooling of Mimosa branches resulted in APs that propagated up to the branch-stem interface and caused drooping of the branch (local response). This electrical activation did not pass the interface. If the branch was triggered by heat, however, a VP was transferred to the stem and caused activation of the entire plant (global response). VPs caused by heat were always preceded by APs and summation of the two types of activation appeared to be necessary for the activation to pass the branch-stem interface. Mechanical cutting of leaves also resulted in VPs preceded by APs, but in those cases a time delay was present between the two activations, which prevented adequate summation and transmission of activation. Simultaneous cold-induced activation of a branch and the stem below the interface occasionally resulted in summation sufficient to activate the stem beyond the interface. To investigate the effect of activation delay on summation, a similar structure of excitable converging pathways, consisting of a star-shaped pattern of neonatal rat heart cells, was used. In this model, summation of activation was not hindered by a small degree of asynchrony. The observations indicate that summation occurs in excitable branching structures and suggest that summation of activation plays a role in the propagation of nocuous stimuli in Mimosa.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2023-05-19", "authors": ["Jacques M Tde Bakker", "RubenCoronel"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0286103\n10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01614.x\n10.1007/978-3-540-37843-3_17\n10.1134/S0006350916030209\n10.1007/s00425-006-0458-y\n10.1134/S102144370604008X\n10.1007/978-3-540-28516-8_20\n10.1093/jxb/42.1.131\n10.1139/b92-183\n10.1016/j.jplph.2012.02.013\n10.1134/S1021443711050256\n10.1007/BF00199972\n10.1093/pcp/pcu082\n10.1007/BF00231397\n10.1104/pp.108.133884\n10.1016/0014-5793(96)00672-2\n10.1093/pcp/pch054\n10.1038/nature12478\n10.1093/jxb/erq404\n10.1007/s00425-011-1529-2\n10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01922.x\n10.3389/fpls.2014.00766\n10.3390/plants10081704\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.11.009\n10.1161/01.cir.88.3.915\n10.1085/jgp.104.2.287\n10.1161/01.res.32.2.170\n10.1126/science.275.5301.841\n10.1007/s00232-013-9529-8\n10.1093/jxb/erm143\n10.1007/BF02493405\n10.1038/srep13425\n10.1104/pp.105.064196\n10.4161/psb.5.10.12658\n10.1113/jphysiol.1970.sp009256\n10.1161/01.cir.65.2.362\n10.1161/CIRCEP.108.789081\n10.1104/pp.106.2.651\n10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.05.008\n10.1034/j.1399-3054.2002.1150204.x\n10.1007/s00425-008-0850-x\n10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb03985.x\n10.1161/01.res.47.3.454\n10.1161/01.res.28.2.220\n10.1007/BF00394867\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.004665\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000081766.16185.28\n10.1161/01.res.68.6.1501\n10.1258/la.2008.0080083"}

After purification, hiPSC-CMs were combined with hiPSC-cardiac fibroblasts to create 3D hiPSC-ECT constructs maintained in culture for four weeks. There were no structural differences observed, and there was no significant difference in sarcomere length between lactate and MACS hiPSC-ECTs.

{"title": "Xuesaitong promotes myocardial angiogenesis in myocardial infarction mice by inhibiting MiR-3158-3p targeting Nur77.", "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the regulatory effect of Xuesaitong (XST) and miR-3158-3p on angiogenesis. All mice were randomly assigned into Sham group, Model group, XST group, XST + miR-3158-3P-overexpression (miRNA-OE) group. XST was found to increase the left ventricular anterior wall thickness at end diastole and end systole (LVAWd and LVAWs), left ventricular internal dimension at end diastole and end systole (LVIDd and LVIDs), fractional shortening (FS), and ejection fraction (EF) and decrease the proportion of fibrotic areas in mice. In contrast to those in Sham group, the protein expressions of Nur77, p-PI3K, HIF-1\u03b1, VEGFs, COX-2 in the heart tissues of mice in Model group were elevated and further increased after XST treatment in comparison with those in Model group. Nur77-/- mice were utilized. It was found that XST enhanced cell viability through a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and facilitated angiogenesis in each group, as assessed by a catheter formation assay. Specifically, XST was shown to promote the formation of blood vessels. Moreover, the protein expression levels of Associated proteins in the heart tissues of Nur77-/- mice were dramatically reduced in mice in Model and XST group compared with those in WT mice. Additionally, the above-mentioned protein expressions in the heart tissues of Nur77-/- mice did not change significantly in mice in Model + miRNA-OE + XST group compared with those in WT mice, suggesting that miR-3158-3p can specifically inhibit the expression of Nur77. In conclusion, XST inhibits miR-3158-3p targeting Nur77 to facilitate myocardial angiogenesis in mice with myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Aging", "date": "2023-05-19", "authors": ["JiangquanLiao", "MingjingShao", "YanWang", "PengYang", "DongliangFu", "MengruLiu", "TongGao", "KangkangWei", "XianlunLi", "JinhangDu"], "doi": "10.18632/aging.204671\n10.1053/sonc.2002.37264\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0179065\n10.1155/2020/9309768\n10.3389/fphar.2021.623533\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.113943\n10.1177/0300060519879292\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.586909\n10.1016/j.brainres.2015.02.042\n10.1158/1538-7445.AM2016-1941\n10.1093/cvr/cvn156\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.10.018\n10.1016/s0735-1097(97)00344-6\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.07.040\n10.1016/j.xjtc.2021.04.006\n10.1182/blood-2002-06-1887\n10.1038/nrc1753\n10.1083/jcb.200907135\n10.1093/ehjci/ehaa946.3738\n10.1096/fj.14-257550"}

{"title": "Hypoxia acclimation improves mitochondrial efficiency in the aerobic swimming muscle of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus).", "abstract": "Environmental hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) is a significant threat facing fishes. As fishes require oxygen to efficiently produce ATP, hypoxia can significantly limit aerobic capacity. However, some fishes show respiratory flexibility that rescues aerobic performance, including plasticity in mitochondrial performance. This plasticity may result in increased mitochondrial efficiency (e.g., less proton leak), increased oxygen storage capacity (increased myoglobin), and oxidative capacity (e.g., higher citrate synthase activity) under hypoxia. We acclimated a hypoxia-tolerant fish, red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), to 8-days of constant hypoxia to induce a hypoxic phenotype. Fish were terminally sampled for cardiac and red muscle tissue to quantify oxidative phosphorylation, proton leak, and maximum respiration in tissue from both hypoxia-acclimated and control fish. Tissue was also collected to assess the plasticity of citrate synthase enzyme activity and mRNA expression for select oxygen storage and antioxidant pathway transcripts. We found that mitochondrial respiration rates were not affected by hypoxia exposure in cardiac tissue, though citrate synthase activity and myoglobin expression were higher following hypoxia acclimation. Interestingly, measures of mitochondrial efficiency in red muscle significantly improved in hypoxia-acclimated individuals. Hypoxia-acclimated fish had significantly higher OXPHOS Control Efficiency, OXPHOS Capacity and Coupling Control Ratios (i.e., LEAK/OXPHOS). There was no significant change to citrate synthase activity or myoglobin expression in red muscle. Overall, these results suggest that red muscle mitochondria of hypoxia-acclimated fish more efficiently utilize oxygen, which may explain previous reports in red drum of improved aerobic swimming performance in the absence of improved maximum metabolic rate following hypoxia acclimation.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "KCCs, NKCCs, and NCC: Potential targets for cardiovascular therapeutics? A comprehensive review of cell and region specific expression and function.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, the leading life-threatening conditions, involve cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and heart valve disease that are associated with the altered functioning of cation-chloride cotransporters. The decreased number of cation-chloride cotransporters leads to reduced reactivity to adrenergic stimulation. The KCC family is crucial for numerous physiological processes including cell proliferation and invasion, regulation of membrane trafficking, maintaining ionic and osmotic homeostasis, erythrocyte swelling, dendritic spine formation, maturation of postsynaptic GABAergic inhibition, and inhibitory/excitatory signaling in neural tracts. KCC2 maintains intracellular chlorine homeostasis and opposes \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation-induced Cl- influx to prevent arrhythmogenesis. KCC3-inactivated cardiac tissue shows increased vascular resistance, aortic distensibility, heart size and weight (i.e. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Due to KCC4's high affinity for K+, it plays a vital role in cardiac ischemia with increased extracellular K+. The NKCC and NCC families play a vital role in the regulation of saliva volume, establishing the potassium-rich endolymph in the cochlea, sodium uptake in astrocytes, inhibiting myogenic response in microcirculatory beds, regulation of smooth muscle tone in resistance vessels, and blood pressure. NKCC1 regulates chlorine homeostasis and knocking it out impairs cardiomyocyte depolarization and cardiac contractility as well as impairs depolarization and contractility of vascular smooth muscle rings in the aorta. The activation of NCC in vascular cells promotes the formation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. This narrative review provides a deep insight into the structure and function of KCCs, NKCCs, and NCC in human physiology and cardiac pathobiology.

Understanding the role of autoantibodies in these conditions is essential for guiding MIS-C management and vaccination strategies in children.\nTo investigate the presence of anticardiac autoantibodies in MIS-C or COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis.\nThis diagnostic study included children with acute MIS-C or acute vaccine myocarditis, adults with myocarditis or inflammatory cardiomyopathy, healthy children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and healthy COVID-19 vaccinated adults. Participants were recruited into research studies in the US, United Kingdom, and Austria starting January 2021. Immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA anticardiac autoantibodies were identified with immunofluorescence staining of left ventricular myocardial tissue from 2 human donors treated with sera from patients and controls. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antihuman IgG, IgM, and IgA.

{"title": "Bilobalide Prevents Apoptosis and\u00a0Improves Cardiac Function in Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is an extremely severe cardiovascular disease, which ranks as the leading cause of sudden death worldwide. Studies have proved that cardiac injury following MI can cause cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. Bilobalide (Bilo) from Ginkgo biloba leaves have been widely reported to possess excellent cardioprotective effects. However, concrete roles of Bilo in MI have not been investigated yet. We here designed both in vitro and in vivo experiments to explore the effects of Bilo on MI-induced cardiac injury and the underlying mechanisms of its action. We conducted in vitro experiments using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated H9c2 cells. Cell apoptosis in H9c2 cells was assessed by conducting flow cytometry assay and evaluating apoptosis-related proteins with western blotting. MI mouse model was established by performing left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation. Cardiac function of MI mice was determined by assessing ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD). Histological changes were analyzed, infarct size and myocardial fibrosis were measured by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson staining in cardiac tissues from the mice. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in MI mice was assessed by TUNEL staining. Western blotting was applied to detect the effect of Bilo on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Bilo inhibited OGD-induced cell apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in H9c2 cells. The protein levels of p-JNK and p-p38 were significantly downregulated by Bilo treatment. SB20358 (inhibitor of p38) and SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK) suppressed OGD-induced cell apoptosis as Bilo did. In MI mouse model, Bilo improved the cardiac function and significantly reduced the infarct size and myocardial fibrosis. Bilo inhibited MI-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis in mice. Bilo suppressed the protein levels of p-JNK and p-p38 in cardiac tissues from MI mice. Bilo alleviated OGD-induced cell apoptosis in H9c2 cells and suppressed MI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis in mice via the inactivation of JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Thus, Bilo may be an effective anti-MI agent.", "journal": "Molecular biotechnology", "date": "2023-05-18", "authors": ["WeifengSong", "ZhenChen", "MengZhang", "HaixiaFu", "XianqingWang", "JifangMa", "XiaobiaoZang", "JuanHu", "FenAi", "KeChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s12033-023-00753-8"}

{"title": "Direct Reprogramming of Resident Non-Myocyte Cells and Its Potential for In Vivo Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiac diseases are the foremost cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The heart has limited regenerative potential; therefore, lost cardiac tissue cannot be replenished after cardiac injury. Conventional therapies are unable to restore functional cardiac tissue. In recent decades, much attention has been paid to regenerative medicine to overcome this issue. Direct reprogramming is a promising therapeutic approach in regenerative cardiac medicine that has the potential to provide in situ cardiac regeneration. It consists of direct cell fate conversion of one cell type into another, avoiding transition through an intermediary pluripotent state. In injured cardiac tissue, this strategy directs transdifferentiation of resident non-myocyte cells (NMCs) into mature functional cardiac cells that help to restore the native tissue. Over the years, developments in reprogramming methods have suggested that regulation of several intrinsic factors in NMCs can help to achieve in situ direct cardiac reprogramming. Among NMCs, endogenous cardiac fibroblasts have been studied for their potential to be directly reprogrammed into both induced cardiomyocytes and induced cardiac progenitor cells, while pericytes can transdifferentiate towards endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. This strategy has been indicated to improve heart function and reduce fibrosis after cardiac injury in preclinical models. This review summarizes the recent updates and progress in direct cardiac reprogramming of resident NMCs for in situ cardiac regeneration.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2023-05-16", "authors": ["SadiaPerveen", "RobertoVanni", "MarcoLo Iacono", "RaffaellaRastaldo", "ClaudiaGiachino"], "doi": "10.3390/cells12081166\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139\n10.1161/JAHA.120.019338\n10.3390/ijms232113073\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309040\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1073/pnas.1805829115\n10.31083/j.rcm2204131\n10.1186/s41232-021-00168-5\n10.3390/cells10092319\n10.3390/cells11233914\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.09.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305374\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.02.026\n10.1007/s11886-022-01666-9\n10.1016/0092-8674(87)90585-X\n10.1101/gad.9.10.1250\n10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00419-2\n10.1016/j.immuni.2006.09.011\n10.1038/nature07314\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002\n10.1038/s41580-021-00335-z\n10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00045\n10.1038/nature11139\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300625\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.271148\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269035\n10.1038/s41598-021-02056-x\n10.1093/cvr/cvv223\n10.1007/BF01908312\n10.1016/0735-1097(89)90360-4\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2005.06.096\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.002\n10.1161/01.RES.0000046452.67724.B8\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.11.012\n10.1161/hy0202.103268\n10.1172/JCI98215\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.06.015\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.005\n10.1038/nature11044\n10.1038/s41598-019-45841-5\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.09.041\n10.1021/acsomega.8b00904\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.11.010\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.04.121\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.034\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305547\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058655\n10.1161/res.115.suppl_1.135\n10.1073/pnas.1301019110\n10.1038/nature24454\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.05.020\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.06.012\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.02.037\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.09.002\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.02.003\n10.1038/celldisc.2016.36\n10.1016/j.scr.2021.102365\n10.1038/s41556-021-00668-z\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003922\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059713\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304510\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.10.034\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.08.104\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00529\n10.1016/j.bbrep.2022.101310\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121028\n10.1021/acsanm.9b02586\n10.1016/j.msec.2021.112323\n10.3390/ijms232315179\n10.2147/IJN.S304873\n10.1016/j.nano.2022.102589\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089678\n10.1038/ncomms9243\n10.3390/cells10071572\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.05.004\n10.15252/embj.201387605\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024692\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2021.07.014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109588\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.01.025\n10.3390/jcdd9040111\n10.1073/pnas.1516237112\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.022\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aay7856\n10.1161/JAHA.121.022659\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.006000\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.07.022\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.034\n10.1038/srep38815\n10.3390/ph15080920\n10.3390/cells11050800\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.01.038\n10.1038/ncb2164\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.07.005\n10.1038/s41422-018-0036-4\n10.1126/science.aaf1502\n10.1161/JAHA.119.015686\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227066\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.12.001\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.118559\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.02.001\n10.1002/stem.3012\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.065\n10.1016/j.vph.2016.05.009\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.10.016\n10.3390/cells10030548\n10.7150/thno.60143\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa287\n10.3892/etm.2021.10986\n10.1172/JCI152308"}

Moreover, CVD and other related inflammatory conditions are associated with infiltration of bacteria and viruses originating from distant body sites. Thus, in this study we aimed to map the presence of microbes in the myocardium of patients with heart disease that we previously found to display upregulated Toll-like receptor signaling. We performed metagenomics analysis of atrial cardiac tissue from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or aortic valve replacement (AVR) and compared with atrial cardiac tissue from organ donors. A total of 119 species of bacteria and seven species of virus were detected in the cardiac tissue. RNA expression of five bacterial species were increased in the patient group of which L. kefiranofaciens correlated positively with cardiac Toll-like receptor-associated inflammation. Interaction network analysis revealed four main gene set clusters involving cell growth and proliferation, Notch signaling, G protein signaling and cell communication in association with L. kefiranofaciens RNA expression. Taken together, intracardial expression of L. kefiranofaciens RNA correlates with pro-inflammatory markers in the diseased cardiac atrium and may have an effect on specific signaling processes important for cell growth, proliferation and cell communication.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2023-05-16", "authors": ["JoakimSandstedt", "KristinaVukusic", "G\u00f6ranDellgren", "AndersJeppsson", "LillemorMattsson Hult\u00e9n", "VictoriaRotter Sopasakis"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-35157-w\n10.4172/1948-593X.1000120\n10.1152/ajpheart.00995.2008\n10.1007/s12265-010-9193-7\n10.1152/ajpheart.00119.2008\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.10.6954\n10.5935/abc.20160005\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.06.033\n10.1016/j.smim.2006.12.002\n10.1042/BJ20090272\n10.3390/molecules171113503\n10.1136/bmj.c2451\n10.1038/ncomms2266\n10.1007/s00380-016-0841-y\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.183\n10.3390/ijms20061414\n10.1016/j.hlc.2018.05.102\n10.1111/jcmm.14195\n10.1007/s11883-020-00848-6\n10.1111/1751-7915.13524\n10.3390/microorganisms8101587\n10.1111/j.1348-0421.2008.00048.x\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.07.232\n10.1371/journal.pone.0054461\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.579979\n10.1073/pnas.1011383107\n10.3390/microorganisms9061218\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.09.001\n10.1016/s0002-9149(99)00653-0\n10.1161/01.atv.20.6.1417\n10.1161/01.cir.103.1.45\n10.5551/jat.32672\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2004.09.020\n10.1016/j.cyto.2007.01.003\n10.1002/biof.5520220141\n10.1159/000492511\n10.3389/fmicb.2020.01454\n10.1016/j.idcr.2022.e01401\n10.3390/nu14061178\n10.1590/1414-431X20198392\n10.1055/a-0992-9114\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.09.046\n10.1038/s41598-022-07260-x\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102"}

{"title": "Circulating immune checkpoints predict heart failure outcomes.", "abstract": "There are limited data examining the role of immune checkpoint (IC) ligands in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). Therefore, we explore this in three HF animal models and in three different human cohorts (healthy, stable, and worsening HF).\nTranscriptomic analyses of cardiac tissue of three different HF mouse models revealed differentially expressed IC receptors and their ligands compared with control mice. Based on this observation, serum levels of three well-known IC ligands (i.e. sPD-L1, sPD-L2 and galectin-9) were measured in stable HF patients from the Vitamin D Chronic Heart Failure (VitD-CHF) study (n\u00a0=\u00a0101), as well as healthy individuals from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease (PREVEND) study (n\u00a0=\u00a058). sPD-L1, sPD-L2, and galectin-9 were all associated with New York Heart Association classification. In multivariate linear regression analyses, all three IC ligands were associated with galectin-3 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.230, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.283, and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.304, respectively). sPD-L1 and galectin-9 were also associated with hs-troponin-T (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.386 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.314). Regarding prognosis, higher serum levels of sPD-L1 and galectin-9 were significantly associated with increased risk for HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 1.69 (1.09-2.59) and hazard ratio 1.50 (1.06-2.12)]. Furthermore, the importance of IC ligands was tested in another stage of HF, namely worsening HF patients. In the worsening HF cohort (The BIOlogy Study to Tailored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure) (n\u00a0=\u00a02032), sPD-L2 and galectin-9 were associated with New York Heart Association classification and significantly predicted outcome with an increased relative risk of 15% and 20%, after multivariable adjustment, respectively.\nIC ligands are expressed in cardiac disease models, and serum levels of IC ligands are elevated in HF patients, are associated with disease severity, and significantly predict prognosis.

Thirty-five male Wistar rats were randomized into five groups of seven rats, including control, saline, ZnO NPs, exercise and exercise\u2009+\u2009ZnO NPs groups. The animal in ZnO NPs and exercise\u2009+\u2009ZnO NPs groups received 1\u00a0mg/kg of ZnO NPs. Rats underwent the treadmill exercise program. Treatments lasted four weeks, 5 days/week. After 4\u00a0weeks of treatment, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), apelin, Ang II and AT1R concentration were measured in heart tissue.Cardiac MDA, Ang II and AT1R levels significantly increased while SOD activity and apelin levels significantly decreased following ZnO NPs administration. The aerobic exercise induced a significant increase in the SOD activity and apelin levels and a significant decrease in the enhanced MDA, Ang II and AT1R levels in the heart of ZnO NPs-exposed rats. These results suggest that the exercise-induced attenuation of the Ang II-AT1R signalling pathway is mediated by reduced lipid peroxidation, augmented antioxidant defence and enhanced apelin synthesis that may be a protective mechanism to prevent and/or treatment ZnO NPs-induced cardiac oxidative stress.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2023-05-15", "authors": ["MasoumehHabibian", "SaraBiniaz", "Seyyed JafarMoosavi"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-023-09792-8\n10.3390/ijms232112940\n10.1186/1472-6882-12-60\n10.2174/1875933501805010016\n10.1186/1556-276X-9-117\n10.3390/ma10121427\n10.1007/s11051-016-3573-0\n10.21608/ejh.2019.7112.1065\n10.2147/IJN.S134897\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6864\n10.1042/CS20200479\n10.1152/ajpcell.00287.2006\n10.1089/ars.2012.4604\n10.2174/0929866524666170728151401\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2008.06.002\n10.1172/JCI34871\n10.3390/ijms20020239\n10.1172/JCI69608\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.07.004\n10.1093/cvr/cvn028\n10.1371/journal.pone.0046114\n10.22038/IJBMS.2018.24796.6165\n10.4149/BLL_2020_00\n10.2478/10004-1254-64-2013-2260\n10.1080/02772248.2018.1430233\n10.26502/fccm.92920102\n10.1113/expphysiol.2010.054221\n10.3390/antiox9010013\n10.1155/2020/2142740\n10.3109/17435390.2013.809809\n10.2147/IJN.S249912\n10.1155/2013/316075\n10.3390/ma5122850\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.03.040\n10.1155/2020/1472514\n10.1007/s11010-014-2008-4\n10.1038/srep16104\n10.1038/s41440-019-0297-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0189535\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.10266"}

What are the physiological roles of cardiomyocyte-derived tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in cardiac metabolism and stress response? What is the main finding and its importance? Cardiomyocyte BH4 has a physiological role in cardiac metabolism. There was a shift of substrate preference from fatty acid to glucose in hearts with targeted deletion of BH4 synthesis. The changes in fatty-acid metabolic profile were associated with a protective effect in response to ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, and reduced infarct size. Manipulating fatty acid metabolism via BH4 availability could play a therapeutic role in limiting IR injury.\nTetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for nitric oxide (NO) synthases in which its production of NO is crucial for cardiac function. However, non-canonical roles of BH4 have been discovered recently and the cell-specific role of cardiomyocyte BH4 in cardiac function and metabolism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we developed a novel mouse model of cardiomyocyte BH4 deficiency, by cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Gch1, which encodes guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I, a required enzyme for de novo BH4 synthesis. Cardiomyocyte (cm)Gch1 mRNA expression and BH4 levels from cmGch1 KO mice were significantly reduced compared to Gch1", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "date": "2023-05-15", "authors": ["Sandy MChu", "Lisa CHeather", "SuraweeChuaiphichai", "ThomasNicol", "BenjaminWright", "MatthieuMiossec", "Jennifer KBendall", "GillianDouglas", "Mark JCrabtree", "Keith MChannon"], "doi": "10.1113/EP090795"}

WT and Akt2 KO mice were fed either normal diet, or high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity model in vivo. Human hepatic cell line (L02 cells) and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were used as in vitro models. We observed that during HFD-induced obesity, Akt2 loss-of-function mitigated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver and heart tissue. Mechanistically, down-regulation of Akt2 promotes SIRT6 expression in L02 cells and NRCMs, the latter deacetylates SOD2, which promotes SOD2 activity and therefore alleviates oxidative stress-induced injury of hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we also proved that AKT2 inhibitor protects hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes from HFD-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, our work prove that AKT2 plays an important role in the regulation of obesity-induced lipid metabolic disorder in the liver and heart.

More importantly, we aimed to identify the potential effects of melatonin on cardiac metabolic reprogramming and energetics in doxorubicin-induced heart failure. Male Wistar rats (n\u2009=\u200918) were randomly divided into three groups (n\u2009=\u20096/group) to receive either (1) normal saline solution as a control, (2) 3\u2009mg/kg/day of doxorubicin on Days 0, 4, 8, 15, 22, and 29, or (3) 3\u2009mg/kg/day of doxorubicin on Days 0, 4, 8, 15, 22, and 29 plus 10\u2009mg/kg/day of melatonin on Days 0-29. On Day 30, echocardiography was carried out and heart rate variability was analyzed for the evaluation of cardiac function. The rats were euthanized on the following day to enable the collection of ventricular cardiac tissue. Compared to the control group, the hearts of rats treated with doxorubicin alone exhibited impaired cardiac function, increased glucose and ketone body utilization, decreased fat utilization, decreased succinate oxidation, and decreased production of adenosine triphosphate. The cotreatment with melatonin could restore cardiac function, glucose and ketone body utilization, and adenosine triphosphate production in the heart. Interestingly, the cotreatment with melatonin led to an increase in cardiac fatty acid oxidation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and anaplerosis. All of these findings highlighted the potential efficacy of melatonin with regard to cardiac metabolic reprogramming and energetics. Our findings also suggested that melatonin could be considered as an adjunctive treatment for doxorubicin-induced heart failure in clinical practice.", "journal": "Journal of pineal research", "date": "2023-05-13", "authors": ["ChanisaThonusin", "WichwaraNawara", "ApiwanArinno", "ThawatchaiKhuanjing", "NanthipPrathumsup", "BenjaminOngnok", "Siriporn CChattipakorn", "NiponChattipakorn"], "doi": "10.1111/jpi.12884"}
{"title": "PAPP-A-Specific IGFBP-4 Proteolysis in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II-as well as their binding proteins (IGFBPs), which regulate their bioavailability-are involved in many pathological and physiological processes in cardiac tissue. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) is a metalloprotease that preferentially cleaves IGFBP-4, releasing IGF and activating its biological activity. Previous studies have shown that PAPP-A-specific IGFBP-4 proteolysis is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemia, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome. However, it remains unclear whether PAPP-A-specific IGFBP-4 proteolysis participates in human normal cardiomyocytes. Here, we report PAPP-A-specific IGFBP-4 proteolysis occurring in human cardiomyocytes derived from two independent induced pluripotent cell lines (hiPSC-CMs), detected both on the cell surface and in the cell secretome. PAPP-A was measured by fluoroimmune analysis (FIA) in a conditioned medium of hiPSC-CMs and was detected in concentrations of up to 4.3 \u00b1 1.33 ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.1 ng/mL. The level of PAPP-A-specific IGFBP-4 proteolysis was determined as the concentration of NT-IGFBP-4 proteolytic fragments using FIA for a proteolytic neo-epitope-specific assay. We showed that PAPP-A-specific IGFBP-4 proteolysis is IGF-dependent and inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. Therefore, it may be concluded that PAPP-A-specific IGFBP-4 proteolysis functions in human normal cardiomyocytes, and hiPSC-CMs contain membrane-bound and secreted forms of proteolytically active PAPP-A.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-05-13", "authors": ["Daria AAdasheva", "Olga SLebedeva", "Daria VGoliusova", "Alexander BPostnikov", "Maria VTeriakova", "Irina VKopylova", "Maria ALagarkova", "Alexey GKatrukha", "Daria VSerebryanaya"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24098420\n10.1006/jmcc.1999.1036\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.10.020\n10.1177/0300060519857839\n10.1530/JME-18-0016\n10.1016/j.ghir.2018.05.002\n10.1074/jbc.M209155200\n10.1074/jbc.M208777200\n10.1042/bj20020831\n10.1210/jcem.84.12.6342\n10.1210/endo.142.12.8517\n10.1073/pnas.96.6.3149\n10.1210/endo.142.5.8286\n10.1161/01.ATV.21.3.335\n10.1210/jcem.87.5.8448\n10.14814/phy2.14006\n10.1016/j.ghir.2007.09.001\n10.1155/2013/190178\n10.1056/NEJMoa003147\n10.1002/ehf2.12590\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2011.12.030\n10.1134/S0006297921110043\n10.1210/clinem/dgaa617\n10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033720\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.022\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.01.013\n10.1007/s12265-020-10085-6\n10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111146\n10.3390/ijms21238893\n10.1152/ajpheart.00819.2012\n10.3389/fcell.2020.00178\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313472\n10.1210/en.2005-0908\n10.1152/ajpcell.00199.2005\n10.1172/JCI116272\n10.1007/s12079-015-0259-9\n10.1373/clinchem.2004.036467\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2018.03.004\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2015.05.010\n10.1095/biolreprod56.4.1050\n10.1080/15384101.2016.1152425\n10.1038/npjparkd.2016.9\n10.1016/S0014-5793(01)02760-0\n10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-3"}
{"title": "Vitamin C Regulates the Profibrotic Activity of Fibroblasts in In Vitro Replica Settings of Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Extracellular collagen remodeling is one of the central mechanisms responsible for the structural and compositional coherence of myocardium in patients undergoing myocardial infarction (MI). Activated primary cardiac fibroblasts following myocardial infarction are extensively investigated to establish anti-fibrotic therapies to improve left ventricular remodeling. To systematically assess vitamin C functions as a potential modulator involved in collagen fibrillogenesis in an in vitro model mimicking heart tissue healing after MI. Mouse primary cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and cultured under normal and profibrotic (hypoxic + transforming growth factor beta 1) conditions on freshly prepared coatings mimicking extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling during healing after an MI. At 10 \u03bcg/mL, vitamin C reprogramed the respiratory mitochondrial metabolism, which is effectively associated with a more increased accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) than the number of those generated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS). The mRNA/protein expression of subtypes I, III collagen, and fibroblasts differentiations markers were upregulated over time, particularly in the presence of vitamin C. The collagen substrate potentiated the modulator role of vitamin C in reinforcing the structure of types I and III collagen synthesis by reducing collagen V expression in a timely manner, which is important in the initiation of fibrillogenesis. Altogether, our study evidenced the synergistic function of vitamin C at an optimum dose on maintaining the equilibrium functionality of radical scavenger and gene transcription, which are important in the initial phases after healing after an MI, while modulating the synthesis of de novo collagen fibrils, which is important in the final stage of tissue healing.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-05-13", "authors": ["YichenXu", "HuaboZheng", "PakhwanNilcham", "OctavianBucur", "FelixVogt", "IoanaSlabu", "Elisa AnamariaLiehn", "MihaelaRusu"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24098379\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1038/s41598-019-53351-7\n10.1186/s13619-020-00065-1\n10.12659/MSM.927404\n10.3389/fcell.2020.621644\n10.1016/j.matbio.2020.05.006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1016/0307-4412(94)90059-0\n10.1096/fasebj.9.15.8529832\n10.3390/cells11091386\n10.1172/JCI146926\n10.15190/d.2022.1\n10.1002/ehf2.12584\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.01.024\n10.1152/ajpcell.00131.2021\n10.1152/ajpheart.00088.2018\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2019.01.001\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000012513.58079.EA\n10.1002/cphy.c150006\n10.9734/jpri/2019/v29i530248\n10.3390/antiox9121227\n10.3390/nu14183717\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.765906\n10.1124/jpet.104.070755\n10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106360\n10.3389/fphys.2021.729255\n10.1136/bmj.314.7081.634\n10.1007/s10741-020-10036-y\n10.3390/molecules26185702\n10.4103/jrpp.JRPP_18_78\n10.1177/2325967118804544\n10.3390/nu11092102\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.01.030\n10.1186/s40360-021-00518-6\n10.1021/acsami.7b16055\n10.1371/journal.pone.0262046\n10.14814/phy2.13324\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.024\n10.1179/135100010X12826446921464\n10.1080/02652048.2018.1477845\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)36075-1\n10.1002/jbt.22176\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.028\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.06.113\n10.7150/thno.35219\n10.1038/s41698-018-0064-z\n10.1089/ars.2019.7897\n10.1007/s12253-018-0539-9\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.03.031\n10.1111/odi.12446\n10.3945/an.113.005157\n10.1146/annurev.nu.14.070194.002103\n10.3390/ijms232314571\n10.1038/s41392-020-00270-z\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.588347\n10.1242/jeb.160093\n10.1016/j.gene.2019.05.003\n10.1091/mbc.E19-03-0140\n10.3390/nu9111211\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.04.002\n10.1016/j.chempr.2019.05.011\n10.1021/cb100298r\n10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114510\n10.3390/biomedicines10092178\n10.15190/d.2023.2\n10.3390/ijms21103685\n10.21037/jtd.2017.03.122\n10.1371/journal.pone.0143274\n10.1253/circj.CJ-16-1003\n10.1111/j.1432-0436.1993.tb00027.x\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1590/2176-9451.19.4.027-029.ebo"}
{"title": "Role of Coxsackievirus B3-Induced Immune Responses in the Transition from Myocarditis to Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiac disease marked by the stretching and thinning of the heart muscle and impaired left ventricular contractile function. While most patients do not develop significant cardiac diseases from myocarditis, disparate immune responses can affect pathological outcomes, including DCM progression. These altered immune responses, which may be caused by genetic variance, can prolong cytotoxicity, induce direct cleavage of host protein, or encourage atypical wound healing responses that result in tissue scarring and impaired mechanical and electrical heart function. However, it is unclear which alterations within host immune profiles are crucial to dictating the outcomes of myocarditis. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a well-studied virus that has been identified as a causal agent of myocarditis in various models, along with other viruses such as adenovirus, parvovirus B19, and SARS-CoV-2. This paper takes CVB3 as a pathogenic example to review the recent advances in understanding virus-induced immune responses and differential gene expression that regulates iron, lipid, and glucose metabolic remodeling, the severity of cardiac tissue damage, and the development of DCM and heart failure.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-05-13", "authors": ["FioneYip", "BrianLai", "DechengYang"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24097717\n10.1016/j.tcm.2020.12.007\n10.1007/s11739-021-02635-w\n10.1056/NEJMc0911362\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00648-X\n10.1002/rmv.2131\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.548156\n10.1136/pmj.77.903.4\n10.1111/joim.12944\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31713-5\n10.1097/01.inf.0000132280.36984.a9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.040037\n10.1007/s10495-006-0013-0\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1006744\n10.3389/fmicb.2020.00767\n10.3389/fmicb.2021.647410\n10.1038/cdd.2015.145\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1001311\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000136824.73458.20\n10.1038/emboj.2010.50\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005466\n10.4049/jimmunol.174.8.4942\n10.1074/jbc.M117.790378\n10.4161/auto.26059\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.009847\n10.1084/jem.20212117\n10.1074/jbc.M109.047464\n10.1038/35099560\n10.1128/JVI.05738-11\n10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00537.x\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.12.004\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00461\n10.1038/nature04734\n10.1098/rspb.2020.3002\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109828\n10.5935/abc.20160005\n10.3389/fcimb.2018.00157\n10.1007/s12975-012-0174-9\n10.1073/pnas.0906070106\n10.1126/science.277.5326.653\n10.1152/ajpheart.00463.2008\n10.1002/ejhf.1154\n10.3390/cells10040818\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)35742-3\n10.1515/pteridines-2020-0004\n10.1038/s41419-020-2298-2\n10.1038/s41419-022-05027-w\n10.3389/fphar.2022.822083\n10.1159/000356649\n10.1007/s00395-022-00948-1\n10.1007/s10565-021-09634-9\n10.3389/fcimb.2021.704494\n10.1128/JVI.01347-17\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01926\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.04.022\n10.1128/mcb.8.8.3496-3509.1988\n10.1038/ng0398-231\n10.1038/ncb3039\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.11.005\n10.3748/wjg.v20.i39.14205\n10.1146/annurev.iy.02.040184.002003\n10.1002/cphy.c170046\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn136\n10.1007/s00395-014-0408-y\n10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.003\n10.4049/jimmunol.170.9.4731\n10.2353/ajpath.2008.070207\n10.1007/s10059-012-2297-y\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.12.005\n10.1038/nature06878\n10.1038/35013000\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1609847\n10.1210/er.2006-0037\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243964\n10.1073/pnas.0603615103\n10.1186/2050-7771-2-1\n10.3390/cancers8030036\n10.1016/S0065-2776(08)00405-7\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00030-4\n10.3389/fcimb.2019.00057\n10.1038/s41598-022-11131-w\n10.3389/fimmu.2016.00409\n10.1093/cvr/cvp040\n10.1016/S1471-4906(01)02154-8\n10.1002/stem.1191\n10.1126/sciadv.aar8320\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2019.104025\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.04.001\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.12.009\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.116.308198\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu225\n10.1172/JCI29919\n10.1007/s10753-017-0681-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.05.010\n10.1172/jci.insight.85851\n10.1038/ni.2044\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.213157\n10.1007/s00395-019-0719-0\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.004\n10.1007/s00395-014-0449-2\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002275\n10.1093/cvr/cvt100\n10.1172/JCI66125\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.05.076\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004125\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.039262\n10.1007/s10753-019-00978-3\n10.1038/ncomms11703\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.04.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.643585\n10.1128/JVI.79.5.2659-2665.2005\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000055318.09997.1F\n10.1186/s12929-022-00840-z\n10.1016/j.isci.2022.103865\n10.1074/jbc.M212609200\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.11.010\n10.1182/blood-2010-07-273417\n10.1073/pnas.0511167103\n10.1152/ajpheart.00305.2007\n10.1111/imr.12577\n10.4049/jimmunol.1601342\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01298\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.236927\n10.3390/ijms19071833\n10.1038/s41598-018-37684-3\n10.1016/j.chom.2020.12.016\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.060350\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043833\n10.1016/j.micinf.2007.09.010\n10.1038/s41467-018-07254-2\n10.1111/bjh.13467\n10.1038/s41590-020-0758-6\n10.1016/j.molimm.2020.06.017\n10.3390/ijms20143394\n10.1002/eji.201040391\n10.1038/ncomms9644\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.16.2055\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00770.x\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132710\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.25.3260\n10.1056/NEJM199007263230405\n10.1038/s41598-019-50791-z\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.019\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.733238\n10.1002/eji.201646557\n10.1177/002215540004800713\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.03.009\n10.1172/jci.insight.134700\n10.1007/s10753-021-01472-5\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116838\n10.1007/s10875-013-9889-y\n10.1006/bmme.1996.0072\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01299-2\n10.1111/imm.13556\n10.1007/s12551-017-0263-9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309685\n10.1093/cvr/cvt144\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010611-134715\n10.3389/fendo.2019.00717\n10.1186/s12959-019-0194-8\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192179\n10.1038/s41598-021-93759-8\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.02.090"}

{"title": "Crosstalk between macrophages and cardiac cells after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI), are a leading cause of death worldwide. Acute MI (AMI) inflicts massive injury to the coronary microcirculation, causing large-scale cardiomyocyte death due to ischemia and hypoxia. Inflammatory cells such as monocytes and macrophages migrate to the damaged area to clear away dead cells post-MI. Macrophages are pleiotropic cells of the innate immune system, which play an essential role in the initial inflammatory response that occurs following MI, inducing subsequent damage and facilitating recovery. Besides their recognized role within the immune response, macrophages participate in crosstalk with other cells (including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells) to coordinate post-MI processes within cardiac tissue. Macrophage-secreted exosomes have recently attracted increasing attention, which has led to a more elaborate understanding of macrophage function. Currently, the functional roles of macrophages in the microenvironment of the infarcted heart, particularly with regard to their interaction with surrounding cells, remain unclear. Understanding the specific mechanisms that mediate this crosstalk is essential in treating MI. In this review, we discuss the origin of macrophages, changes in their distribution post-MI, phenotypic and functional plasticity, as well as the specific signaling pathways involved, with a focus on the crosstalk with other cells in the heart. Thus, we provide a new perspective on the treatment of MI. Further in-depth research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying crosstalk between macrophages and other cells within cardiac tissue for the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

{"title": "Inhibition of ferroptosis alleviates high-power microwave-induced myocardial injury.", "abstract": "The use of high-power microwave (HPM) in our daily live is becoming more and more widespread, but the safety has also caused our concern. And ferroptosis is a newly discovered modality that can regulate cell death in recent years. The aim of our study was to demonstrate whether ferroptosis is an important cause of myocardial injury caused by HPM. And whether myocardial injury caused by HPM can be alleviated by inhibiting ferroptosis.\nWe verified the extent of myocardial damage by different doses of HPM through \nWe found that cardiac tissue and cardiomyocyte injury in mice gradually increased with increasing HPM dose, while ferroptosis markers were consistent with the injury trend. Gpx4 had an important role in ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes caused by HPM. Finally, tanshinoneIIA and Fer-1 could attenuate the damage of cardiac tissues and cardiomyocytes caused by HPM.\nIn conclusion, our study found that ferroptosis, a novel mode of cell death, is present in myocardial injury caused by HPM. Moreover, tanshinone, a drug already in clinical use, can significantly reduce myocardial injury caused by HPM, which is promising to provide new therapeutic ideas for myocardial injury caused by HPM.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2023-05-12", "authors": ["YuWang", "YanLu", "WenChen", "XiaohuaXie"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2023.1157752\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.06.056\n10.3967/0895-3988.2012.02.009\n10.7205/MILMED-D-12-00134\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.05.071\n10.1080/09603120500105695\n10.1002/bem.2250050407\n10.1016/j.jksus.2018.11.007\n10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.037\n10.13505/j.1007-1482.2017.22.01.001\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.1038/nature05859\n10.1038/ncb3064\n10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-030518-055844\n10.1096/fasebj.10.8.8666169\n10.1016/j.mrgentox.2005.03.006\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316509\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.090\n10.3389/fphar.2019.00638\n10.1093/ndt/gfz106.FP282\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110282\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.08.067\n10.18632/aging.202202\n10.1134/S0022093012050039\n10.1155/2021/3985697\n10.1084/jem.102.1.37\n10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.03.015\n10.3390/cells11091399\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.061\n10.1089/dna.2019.5097\n10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01104\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.026622\n10.3390/ph14070597\n10.1046/j.1365-201X.2001.00887.x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.09.012\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.08.009\n10.1155/2019/5080843\n10.1155/2014/360438\n10.1186/s13046-022-02296-3\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2019.151058\n10.2147/IJN.S282489\n10.2174/1389203720666190206130003\n10.3389/fncel.2021.615372\n10.1007/s11655-021-3527-y\n10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105466\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050071\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.06.007\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.12.010\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.08.124\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.10.040\n10.1016/j.pan.2020.07.012\n10.1007/s13238-020-00789-5\n10.1002/ptr.7002\n10.1155/2021/6551069\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.1021/ja411006a\n10.1186/s12974-022-02400-6\n10.3389/fnins.2020.00267\n10.1089/ars.2019.7905\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.09.076\n10.1042/BJ20070245\n10.1074/jbc.274.41.29294\n10.1042/bj3510183\n10.1096/fj.201900077R\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.041\n10.1080/17512433.2021.1878877\n10.26508/lsa.202201667\n10.7150/thno.28315"}
{"title": "Computational Study on Effect of KCNQ1 P535T Mutation in a Cardiac Ventricular Tissue.", "abstract": "Heart diseases such as arrhythmia are the main causes of sudden death. Arrhythmias are typically caused by mutations in specific genes, damage in the cardiac tissue, or due to some chemical exposure. Arrhythmias caused due to mutation is called inherited arrhythmia. Induced arrhythmias are caused due to tissue damage or chemical exposure. Mutations in genes that encode ion channels of the cardiac cells usually result in (dysfunction) improper functioning of the channel. Improper functioning of the ion channel may lead to major changes in the action potential (AP) of the cardiac cells. This further leads to distorted electrical activity of the heart. Distorted electrical activity will affect the ECG that results in arrhythmia. KCNQ1 P535T mutation is one such gene mutation that encodes the potassium ion channel (KV7.1) of the cardiac ventricular tissue. Its clinical significance is not known. This study aims to perform a simulation study on P535T mutation in the KCNQ1 gene that encodes the potassium ion channel KV7.1 in the ventricular tissue grid. The effect of P535T mutation on transmural tissue grids for three genotypes (wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous) of cells are studied and the generated pseudo-ECGs are compared. Results show the delayed repolarization in the cells of ventricular tissue grid. Slower propagation of action potential in the transmural tissue grid is observed in the mutated (heterozygous and homozygous) genotypes. Longer QT interval is also observed in the pseudo-ECG of heterozygous and homozygous genotype tissue grids. From the pseudo-ECGs, it is observed that KCNQ1 P535T mutation leads to Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) which may result in life-threatening arrhythmias, such as Torsade de Pointes (TdP), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), and Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS).", "journal": "The Journal of membrane biology", "date": "2023-05-11", "authors": ["HelanSatish", "Ramasubba ReddyMachireddy"], "doi": "10.1007/s00232-023-00287-9\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002313\n10.22038/IJBMS.2017.23207.5908\n10.1038/384078a0\n10.1002/0471250953.bi0113s12\n10.1161/01.RES.0000016960.61087.86\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.112.964684\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.625449\n10.1002/0471142905.hg0816s89\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-101932\n10.1016/0002-8703(57)90079-0\n10.1152/physiol.00031.2005\n10.1161/01.RES.86.12.1193\n10.1124/pr.110.003723\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.08.017\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.117.001754\n10.1253/circj.cj-14-0905\n10.1038/384080a0\n10.1093/emboj/19.3.332\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00794.2003\n10.1016/j.hlc.2007.05.008\n10.1016/j.ccep.2016.01.002\n10.1086/425342"}

{"title": "Metabolites and gene expression in the myocardium of fasting rats in an acute hypoxic environment.", "abstract": "With the rising demand for entry to extremely high altitudes (HAs), rapid adaptability to extremely hypoxic environments is a challenge that we need to explore. Fasting was used to evaluate acute hypoxia tolerance at HA and was proven to be an effective method for improving the survival rate at extreme HA. Our experiments also showed that fasting pretreatment for 72\u00a0h significantly increased the 24\u00a0h survival rate of rats at 7620\u00a0m from 10 to 85% and protected the myocardium cells of rats. Here, we compared the metabolites and gene expression in the myocardium of SD rats pretreated with fasting and nonfasting at normal altitude and extreme HA. Our findings demonstrated that the dynamic contents of detected differential metabolites (DMs) between different rat groups were consistent with the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and DM clusters also showed strong correlations with DEG clusters. DM clusters related to amino acids and lipids were significantly lower in the fasting groups, and the correlated DEG clusters were enriched in mitotic pathways, including CDK1, CDC7, NUF2, and MCM6, suggesting that fasting can attenuate mitotic processes in cardiac tissues and reduce the synthesis of amino acids and lipids. L-Glutamine-related metabolites were particularly low at extreme HA without pretreatment but were normal in the fasting groups. The DEGs in the cluster related to L-glutamine-related metabolites were enriched for T-cell receptor V(D)J recombination, the Hippo signaling pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and the mTOR signaling pathway and were significantly downregulated, indicating that the content of L-glutamine decreased at extreme HA, while fasting increased it to adapt to the environment. Moreover, abundant fatty acids were detected when rats were exposed to extreme HA without pretreatment. Our study revealed the fasting and hypoxic environment-related factors in SD rats and provided new insights into the genetic and molecular characteristics in the myocardium, which is critical to developing more potential rapid adaptation methods to extreme HA.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2023-05-11", "authors": ["RuzhouZhao", "XiaoboWang", "XiangZhou", "ShuaiJiang", "LinZhang", "ZhibinYu"], "doi": "10.1186/s12864-023-09309-1\n10.1089/ham.2017.0088\n10.3390/jcm11143937\n10.1056/NEJM196901232800402\n10.1056/NEJMcp1214870\n10.1123/ijsnem.2018-0256\n10.1038/s41419-021-04351-x\n10.1038/s41580-020-0227-y\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.03.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.042\n10.1016/j.pcad.2010.02.003\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.10.013\n10.1002/cpbi.51\n10.1186/s13059-014-0572-2\n10.1134/S0026893320020041\n10.1186/1471-2105-9-559\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1957.188.2.332\n10.1016/j.molcel.2020.03.010\n10.4161/cc.10.3.14709\n10.1253/circj.CJ-18-0925\n10.3390/nu11092092\n10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110824\n10.1002/humu.22529\n10.1007/s13238-020-00766-y\n10.1016/j.immuni.2020.09.005\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.00470\n10.3892/or.2020.7869"}
{"title": "A possible new cardiac heterogeneity as an arrhythmogenic driver.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 3 million people in the USA and 8 million in the EU (according to the European Society of Cardiology). So, why is it that even with the best medical care, around a third of the patients are treatment resistant. Extensive research of its etiology showed that AF and its mechanisms are still debatable. Some of the AF origins are ascribed to functional and ionic heterogeneities of the heart tissue and possibly to additional triggering agents. But, have all AF origins been detected? Are all accepted origins, in fact, arrhythmogenic? In order to study these questions and specifically to check our new idea of intermittency as an arrhythmogenesis agent, we chose to employ a mathematical model which was as simple as possible, but which could still be used to observe the basic network processes of AF development. At this point we were not interested in the detailed ionic propagations nor in the actual shapes of the induced action potentials (APs) during the AF outbreaks. The model was checked by its ability to exactly recapture the basic AF developmental stages known from experimental cardiac observations and from more elaborate mathematical models. We use a simple cellular automata 2D mathematical model of N \u00d7 N matrices to elucidate the field processes leading to AF in a tissue riddled with randomly distributed heterogeneities of different types, under sinus node operation, simulated by an initial line of briefly stimulated cells inducing a propagating wave, and with or without an additional active ectopic action potential pulse, in turn simulated by a transitory operation of a specific cell. Arrhythmogenic contributions, of three different types of local heterogeneities in myocytes and their collaborations, in inducing AF are examined. These are: a heterogeneity created by diffuse fibrosis, a heterogeneity created by myocytes having different refractory periods, and a new heterogeneity type, created by intermittent operation of some myocytes. The developmental stages (target waves and spirals) and the different probabilities of AF occurring under each condition, are shown. This model was established as being capable of reproducing the known AF origins and their basic development stages, and in addition has shown: (1) That diffuse fibrosis on its own is not arrhythmogenic but in combination with other arrhythmogenic agents it can either enhance or limit AF. (2) In general, combinations of heterogeneities can act synergistically, and, most importantly, (3) The new type of intermittency heterogeneity proves to be extremely arrhythmogenic. Both the intermittency risk and the fibrosis role in AF generation were established.

{"title": "Generation of left ventricle-like cardiomyocytes with improved structural, functional, and metabolic maturity from human pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Decreased left ventricle (LV) function caused by genetic mutations or injury often leads to debilitating and fatal cardiovascular disease. LV cardiomyocytes are, therefore, a potentially valuable therapeutical target. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) are neither homogeneous nor functionally mature, which reduces their utility. Here, we exploit cardiac development knowledge to instruct differentiation of hPSCs specifically toward LV cardiomyocytes. Correct mesoderm patterning and retinoic acid pathway blocking are essential to generate near-homogenous LV-specific hPSC-CMs (hPSC-LV-CMs). These cells transit via first heart field progenitors and display typical ventricular action potentials. Importantly, hPSC-LV-CMs exhibit increased metabolism, reduced proliferation, and improved cytoarchitecture and functional maturity compared with age-matched cardiomyocytes generated using the standard WNT-ON/WNT-OFF protocol. Similarly, engineered heart tissues made from hPSC-LV-CMs are better organized, produce higher force, and beat more slowly but can be paced to physiological levels.

Despite heart-on-a-chip (HoC) technology becoming an increasingly popular tool for evaluating DIC, its development remains a challenge owing to the anisotropic cardiac structure of the native myocardium. Herein, an anisotropic multiscale cardiac scaffold is presented via a hybrid biofabrication method by combining 3D printing with electrospinning technology, where the 3D-printed micrometer-scale scaffold frames enable mimicking the interwoven myocardium anatomical structure and the branched-aligned electrospun nanofibers network is able to directionally guide cellular arrangements. The in vitro 3D bioengineered cardiac tissues are then fabricated by encapsulating three-layer multiscale scaffolds within a photocurable methacrylated gelatin hydrogel shell. It is demonstrated that such an anisotropic multiscale structure could contribute to enhancing cardiomyocyte maturation and synchronous beating behavior. More attractively, with the integration of 3D bioengineered cardiac tissues and a self-designed microfluidic perfusion system, a 3D anisotropic HoC platform is established for evaluating DIC and cardioprotective efficacy. Collectively, these results indicate that the HoC model developed by integrating the 3D bioengineered cardiac tissues could effectively recapitulate the clinical manifestations, thereby highlighting their efficacy as a valuable preclinical platform for testing drug efficacy and cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2023-05-08", "authors": ["SitianLiu", "ZihanWang", "XinyiChen", "MingyingHan", "JieXu", "TingLi", "LiuYu", "MaoyuQin", "MengLong", "MingchuanLi", "HongwuZhang", "YanbingLi", "LingWang", "WenhuaHuang", "YaobinWu"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202300719"}

{"title": "Cyclophosphamide enfeebles myocardial isometric contraction force via RIP1/RIP3/MLKL/TRPM7-mediated necroptosis.", "abstract": "This study explores the negative impact of cyclophosphamide (CP) on cardiac contractility by specifically examining its effect on the active and passive tension of the cardiac muscle in-vitro and revealing the mechanism through which CP induces myocardial insult in-vivo. In young male Sprague-Dawley rats, cardiac toxicity was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of CP (150\u00a0mg/kg body weight). Axial heart tissue slices were electrically stimulated, and the total isometric contraction force was measured at varying pretension levels. Blood and tissue biochemical assays, and histological/ immuno-histological assessments were conducted to evaluate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Statistical analysis shows that there is a significant difference between the drugged and the control groups in terms of the active tension values. Moreover, the pre-tension stress significantly affects both the active and passive tension values. CP altered heart, body, and heart-to-body weight, desolated cardiac muscle architecture, surged cardiac enzymes (CK-MB, LDH, and cTn l), augmented myocardial oxidative stressors (MDA), and weakened myocardial antioxidant status (SOD and GSH). Mechanistically, cyclophosphamide prompted the necroptotic trajectory evidenced by the activation of RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL and TRPM7, the inhibition of caspase 8 and BCL2 and the upregulation of the protein/mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TNFR1. This study identifies necroptosis as a key factor in cyclophosphamide-evoked myocardial contractility impairment, highlighting its potential as a target for alleviating antitumor-related myocardial damage. This innovative approach to investigating the underlying mechanisms of CP-induced cardiac toxicity offers valuable insights into the potential of developing new therapies to mitigate cyclophosphamide's negative impact.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2023-05-06", "authors": ["Yasmin SAbulfadl", "Yousef AboEl Ela", "Abdallah MAl Khaiyat", "Khalil IElkhodary", "MohamedBadran"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114819"}

{"title": "Mechanically induced alterations in chromatin architecture guide the balance between cell plasticity and mechanical memory.", "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity, or adaptability, of a cell determines its ability to survive and function within changing cellular environments. Changes in the mechanical environment, ranging from stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to physical stress such as tension, compression, and shear, are critical environmental cues that influence phenotypic plasticity and stability. Furthermore, an exposure to a prior mechanical signal has been demonstrated to play a fundamental role in modulating phenotypic changes that persist even after the mechanical stimulus is removed, creating stable mechanical memories. In this mini review, our objective is to highlight how the mechanical environment alters both phenotypic plasticity and stable memories through changes in chromatin architecture, mainly focusing on examples in cardiac tissue. We first explore how cell phenotypic plasticity is modulated in response to changes in the mechanical environment, and then connect the changes in phenotypic plasticity to changes in chromatin architecture that reflect short-term and long-term memories. Finally, we discuss how elucidating the mechanisms behind mechanically induced chromatin architecture that lead to cell adaptations and retention of stable mechanical memories could uncover treatment methods to prevent mal-adaptive permanent disease states.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2023-05-05", "authors": ["Adrienne KScott", "MichaelRafuse", "Corey PNeu"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2023.1084759\n10.1002/adhm.201600349\n10.1161/01.cir.45.2.310\n10.1073/pnas.1902035116\n10.1039/c2ib00149g\n10.1007/s12195-021-00705-9\n10.1186/s13036-019-0197-9\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.08.002\n10.1002/adhm.202000030\n10.1091/mbc.E18-04-0256\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.019\n10.1172/JCI24178\n10.1038/nmat3777\n10.1096/fj.202001274R\n10.1038/nature10137\n10.1038/s41576-022-00493-6\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/j.bpj.2018.03.011\n10.1002/adhm.201601152\n10.1152/ajpheart.00836.2004\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00772\n10.1016/J.BPJ.2021.11.018\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.04.009\n10.1126/science.1191035\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.006\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.02.087\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.052\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315582\n10.1016/j.cub.2016.06.011\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.07.006\n10.1038/srep16895\n10.1038/s41551-022-00910-5\n10.1056/NEJMra072139\n10.1038/nrm2597\n10.3390/diseases7030052\n10.1146/annurev-neuro-070918-050509\n10.1115/1.4053797\n10.1038/s41580-022-00480-z\n10.1515/hsz-2018-0328\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.02.003\n10.1038/oby.2011.101\n10.1002/advs.201801483\n10.1073/pnas.2006765117\n10.1038/emm.2017.10\n10.1038/s41556-018-0038-y\n10.1161/01.cir.79.4.744\n10.1196/annals.1302.005\n10.1172/JCI19670\n10.1038/ncb3387\n10.1038/nmat4780\n10.3389/fphys.2021.710809\n10.1074/jbc.M111.233700\n10.1042/BST20110686\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304937\n10.1093/nar/gkw131\n10.1242/jcs.247643\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00824\n10.1101/2020.03.20.000802\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.07.044\n10.1242/jcs.202192\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.012\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.052\n10.1073/pnas.1502111112\n10.1038/s41578-020-00238-z\n10.1186/s12918-017-0429-x\n10.1152/jappl.2001.91.2.645\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.03.016\n10.1016/j.cophys.2021.100482\n10.1038/nrm2640\n10.5339/gcsp.2014.19\n10.1016/j.biocel.2021.106035\n10.1016/s0008-6363(00)00076-6\n10.1038/s41569-019-0155-8\n10.1101/2022.10.23.513439\n10.1016/j.bpj.2023.03.004\n10.1038/S41551-021-00823-9\n10.1042/CS20080163\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.052\n10.1038/s41563-022-01312-3\n10.1007/s12195-016-0444-9\n10.1016/j.jss.2007.01.037\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.02.011\n10.1038/nmat4729\n10.1042/BST20130012\n10.1016/s0092-8674(02)01080-2\n10.1016/B978-0-12-803395-1.00001-0\n10.1038/nrm.2017.101\n10.1016/j.tcb.2021.02.008\n10.1002/btm2.10394\n10.1038/s41551-021-00709-w\n10.1152/ajpheart.00387.2003\n10.1091/mbc.E16-12-0825\n10.1021/acsami.9b18425\n10.1007/s10558-007-9038-4\n10.1101/gad.1458906\n10.1038/s41586-021-04081-2\n10.1016/j.gde.2020.12.007\n10.1161/01.res.82.4.430\n10.1038/nmat3889\n10.1007/s10237-019-01271-w\n10.1007/s10237-022-01589-y\n10.1016/j.hlc.2012.11.021\n10.1038/s41580-019-0132-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044061\n10.1016/j.molmed.2022.05.010"}

{"title": "Early markers of Sepsis Cardiomyopathy in Murine Models by Echocardiography.", "abstract": "Strain echocardiography (SE) is a procedure for analyzing myocardial dysfunction that is known to be less dependent on preload and afterload of heart function. Unlike dimension-based parameters, like ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), SE measures cardiac function by tracking cardiac tissue deformation and anomalies throughout the cardiac cycle. Although SE is proven to locate myocardial ailments in various heart diseases, few studies exist regarding using SE relevant to sepsis pathophysiology.\nThe study aimed to calculate the myocardial strain and strain rates, like longitudianl strain (LS), global radial strain (GRS), and global longitudinal strain (GLS), and to show these to be reduced earlier in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis in coordination with an elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines Methodology: Wild-type mice C57BL/6J (WT) were taken in this study and classified as CLP, LPS, and control groups. CLP surgery and LPS injection were given to induce sepsis. Endotoxemic septic shock was induced by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of LPS Escherichia coli. Echocardiography short axis views (SAX), longitudinal strain (LS), global circumferential strain (GCS), and global radial strain (GRS) were measured from the anterior and posterior positions of the septal and lateral walls of the heart. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to evaluate post-CLP and LPS to analyze cardiac pro-inflammatory cytokines expressions. Inter- and intra-observer variables were tested by Bland-Altman analyses (BA). All data analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism 6 software. p<0.05 was taken as statistically significant.\nAfter 48 hours following CLP and LPS-induced sepsis, a significant declination in both longitudinal strain and strain rate (LS and LSR) was identified in the CLP and LPS groups compared to the control group. Strain depression in sepsis was linked with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RT-PCR analysis.\nIn the present study, we found myocardial strain and strain rate parameters, like LS, GRS, and GLS, to be reduced after CLP and LPS-induced sepsis in coordination with the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "journal": "Current medical imaging", "date": "2023-05-03", "authors": ["SanjeevNirala", "XueRui Tan"], "doi": "10.2174/1573405620666230428123541"}
{"title": "miR-21-5p prevents doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy by downregulating BTG2.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been characterized as one of the major mechanisms underlying doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy. MicroRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p) was reported to mitigate ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac injury. However, to our knowledge, the functional role of miR-21-5p in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy is unclear. In this study, we explored the role of miR-21-5p in DOX-induced cardiac injury. The expression level of miR-21-5p was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the potential target gene of miR-21-5p. The apoptosis rate of NRCMs was detected by TUNEL staining assay. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase3, cleaved-Caspase3 and BTG2. For animal studies, mice were injected with AAV9-miR-21-5p or AAV9-Empty viruses, and treated with DOX at a dose of 5 mg/kg per week through intraperitoneally administration. After 4 weeks of DOX treatment, mice were subjected to echocardiography to measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS). Results showed that miR-21-5p was upregulated in both DOX-treated primary cardiomyocytes and mouse heart tissues. Interestingly, enhanced miR-21-5p expression inhibited DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress, while decreased miR-21-5p expression promoted cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress. Furthermore, cardiac overexpression of miR-21-5p protected against DOX-induced cardiac injury. The mechanistic study indicated that BTG2 was a target gene of miR-21-5p. The anti-apoptotic effect of miR-21-5p could be inhibited by BTG2 overexpression. Conversely, inhibition of BTG2 rescued the pro-apoptotic effect of miR-21-5p inhibitor. Taken together, our study showed that miR-21-5p could prevent DOX-induced cardiomyopathy by downregulating BTG2.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2023-05-03", "authors": ["QingweiWang", "FeiJiang", "ChenglinZhao", "JiaxinSong", "MeiyuHu", "YichengLv", "YiDuan", "WenqianFang", "RongjingDing", "YanQiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15451"}

{"title": "Proteomics and phosphoproteomics of failing human left ventricle identifies dilated cardiomyopathy-associated phosphorylation of CTNNA3.", "abstract": "The prognosis and treatment outcomes of heart failure (HF) patients rely heavily on disease etiology, yet the majority of underlying signaling mechanisms are complex and not fully elucidated. Phosphorylation is a major point of protein regulation with rapid and profound effects on the function and activity of protein networks. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies examining cardiac tissue from HF patients with either dilated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or ischemic\u00a0cardiomyopathy (ICM). Here, we used a combined proteomic and phosphoproteomic approach to identify and quantify more than 5,000 total proteins with greater than 13,000 corresponding phosphorylation sites across explanted left ventricle (LV) tissue samples, including HF patients with DCM vs. nonfailing controls (NFC), and left ventricular infarct vs. noninfarct, and periinfarct vs. noninfarct regions of HF patients with ICM. Each pair-wise comparison revealed unique global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles with both shared and etiology-specific perturbations. With this approach, we identified a DCM-associated hyperphosphorylation cluster in the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc (ICD) protein, \u03b1T-catenin (CTNNA3). We demonstrate using both ex\u00a0vivo isolated cardiomyocytes and in\u00a0vivo using an AAV9-mediated overexpression mouse model, that CTNNA3 phosphorylation at these residues plays a key role in maintaining protein localization at the cardiomyocyte ICD to regulate conductance and cell-cell adhesion. Collectively, this integrative proteomic/phosphoproteomic approach identifies region- and etiology-associated signaling pathways in human HF and describes a role for CTNNA3 phosphorylation in the pathophysiology of DCM.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2023-05-01", "authors": ["Cristine JReitz", "MarjanTavassoli", "Da HyeKim", "SaumyaShah", "RobertLakin", "Allen C TTeng", "Yu-QingZhou", "WenpingLi", "SinaHadipour-Lakmehsari", "Peter HBackx", "AndrewEmili", "Gavin YOudit", "UrosKuzmanov", "Anthony OGramolini"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2212118120\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056600"}
{"title": "Empagliflozin attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by activating AMPK/SIRT-1/PGC-1\u03b1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.", "abstract": "We aimed to probe the functions and possible mechanisms of empagliflozin in doxorubicin (Dox)-caused cardiotoxicity. First, a cardiotoxicity rat model was built by continuously injecting Dox intraperitoneally. Then, empagliflozin (30\u00a0mg/kg) was gavaged into the rats. Next, echocardiography was utilized for checking the cardiac function of rats, and H&E staining for observing pathological alterations of the myocardial tissues. Besides, biochemical assays and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay were adopted to detect the creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels in rat serum and superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde acid (MDA), and catalase (CAT) in myocardial tissue, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of AMPK/SIRT-1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway-related proteins in the myocardial tissues was tested by Western blot. Continuous intraperitoneal injection of Dox greatly elevated left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), reduced fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF), and notably up-regulated CK-MB and NT-proBNP level in rats' serum, thus impairing cardiac function. Empagliflozin treatment could ameliorate myocardial histopathological damage and alleviate cardiac function and tissue damage by down-regulating LVEDD and LVESD, up-regulating EF and FS, and inhibiting CK-MB and NT-proBNP level in serum. Additionally, empagliflozin improved Dox-induced excessive oxidative stress and dysregulation of energy metabolism. Furthermore, empagliflozin activated the AMPK/SIRT-1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway in Dox-caused cardiotoxicity rats. In conclusion, in addition to bettering the cardiac tissue and function injury caused by Dox, empagliflozin also improves excessive oxidative stress and energy metabolism.

However, insufficient mechanical strength and low cell retention lead to limited therapeutic efficiency. The thickness and area of artificial cardiac patches also affect their therapeutic efficiency. Cardiac patches prepared by combining cell sheets with electrospun nanofibers, which can be transplanted and sutured to the surface of the infarcted heart, promise to solve this problem. Here, we fabricated a novel cardiac patch by stacking brown adipose-derived stem cells (BADSCs) sheet layer by layer, and then they were combined with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-containing electrospun polycaprolactone/silk fibroin nanofibers (CPSN). The results demonstrated that BADSCs tended to generate myocardium-like structures seeded on CPSN. Compared with BADSCs suspension-containing electrospun nanofibers, the transplantation of the CPSN-BADSCs sheets (CNBS) cardiac patches exhibited accelerated angiogenesis and decreased inflammation in a rat myocardial infarction model. In addition, the CNBS cardiac patches could regulate macrophage polarization and promote gap junction remodeling, thus restoring cardiac functions.

Studies have shown that soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) has a harmful effect on the heart after MI. However, ergothioneine (ERG) has been shown to have protective effects in rats with preeclampsia by reducing circulating levels of sFlt-1. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism by which ERG protects the heart after MI in rats. Our results indicate that treatment with 10\u00a0mg/kg ERG for 7 days can improve cardiac function as determined by echocardiography. Additionally, ERG can reduce the size of the damaged area, prevent heart remodeling, fibrosis, and reduce cardiomyocyte death after MI. To explain the mechanism behind the cardioprotective effects of ERG, we conducted several experiments. We observed a significant reduction in the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), p65, and p-p65 proteins in heart tissues of ERG-treated rats compared to the control group. ELISA results also showed that ERG significantly reduced plasma levels of sFlt-1. Using Glutaredoxin-1 (GLRX) and CD31 immunofluorescence, we found that GLRX was expressed in clusters in the myocardial tissue surrounding the coronary artery, and ERG can reduce the expression of GLRX caused by MI. In vitro experiments using a human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) hypoxia model confirmed that ERG can reduce the expression of sFlt-1, GLRX, and Wnt5a. These findings suggest that ERG protects the heart from MI damage by reducing s-glutathionylation through the NF-\u0138B-dependent Wnt5a-sFlt-1 pathway.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2023-05-01", "authors": ["RuiDuan", "HaotianPan", "DongChengLi", "ShengenLiao", "BingHan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2023.175759"}
{"title": "Amplification of Plasma MicroRNAs for Non-invasive Early Detection of Acute Rejection after Heart Transplantation With Ultrasound-Targeted Microbubble Destruction.", "abstract": "Acute rejection (AR) screening has always been the focus of patient management in the first several years after heart transplantation (HT). As potential biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of AR, microRNAs (miRNAs) are limited by their low abundance and complex origin. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technique could temporarily alter vascular permeability through cavitation. We hypothesized that increasing the permeability of myocardial vessels might enhance the abundance of circulating AR-related miRNAs, thus enabling the non-invasive monitoring of AR.\nThe Evans blue assay was applied to determine efficient UTMD parameters. Blood biochemistry and echocardiographic indicators were used to ensure the safety of the UTMD. AR of the HT model was constructed using Brown-Norway and Lewis rats. Grafted hearts were sonicated with UTMD on postoperative day (POD) 3. The polymerase chain reaction was used to identify upregulated miRNA biomarkers in graft tissues and their relative amounts in the blood.\nAmounts of six kinds of plasma miRNA, including miR-142-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-326-3p, miR-182, miR-155-5p and miR-223-3p, were 10.89\u2009\u00b1\u20091.36, 13.54\u2009\u00b1\u20092.15, 9.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70, 8.55\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00, 12.50 \u00b1 3.96 and 11.02\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47 times higher in the UTMD group than those in the control group on POD 3. Plasma miRNA abundance in the allograft group without UTMD did not differ from that in the isograft group on POD 3.

Previous studies show LPS to rapidly hyperpolarize larval Drosophila skeletal muscle, followed by desensitization and return to baseline. In larvae, heart rate increased then decreased with exposure to LPS. However, responses to LTA, as well as the combination of LTA and LPS, on the larval Drosophila heart have not been previously examined. This study examined the effects of LTA and a cocktail of LTA and LPS on heart rate. The combined effects were examined by first treating with either LTA or LPS only, and then with the cocktail. The results showed a rapid increase in heart rate upon LTA application, followed by a gradual decline over time. When applying LTA followed by the cocktail, an increase in the rate occurred. However, if LPS was applied before the cocktail, the rate continued declining. These responses indicate the receptors or cellular cascades responsible for controlling heart rate within seconds and the rapid desensitization are affected by LTA or LPS and a combination of the two.

{"title": "SARS-CoV-2-Induced Myocarditis: A State-of-the-Art Review.", "abstract": "In this review, we investigated whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly cause myocarditis with severe myocardial damage induced by viral particles. A review of the major data published from 2020 to 2022 was performed by consulting the major databases alongside first-hand experiences that emerged from the cardiac biopsies and autopsy examinations of patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 infections. From this study, a significantly large amount of data suggests that the Dallas criteria were met in a residual percentage of patients, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was a rare clinical and pathological entity that occurred in a small percentage of subjects. All cases described here were highly selected and subjected to autopsies or endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs). The most important discovery, through the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using the polymerase chain reaction, consisted in the presence of the viral genome in the lung tissue of most of the patients who died from COVID-19. However, the discovery of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was a rare event in cardiac tissue from autopsy findings of patients who died of myocarditis It is important to emphasize that myocardial inflammation alone, as promoted by macrophages and T cell infiltrations, can be observed in noninfectious deaths and COVID-19 cases, but the extent of each cause is varied, and in neither case have such findings been reported to support clinically relevant myocarditis. Therefore, in the different infected vs. non-infected samples examined, none of our findings provide a definitive histochemical assessment for the diagnosis of myocarditis in the majority of cases evaluated. We report evidence suggesting an extremely low frequency of viral myocarditis that has also been associated with unclear therapeutic implications. These two key factors strongly point towards the use of an endomyocardial biopsy to irrefutably reach a diagnosis of viral myocarditis in the context of COVID-19.", "journal": "Viruses", "date": "2023-04-28", "authors": ["FrancescoNappi", "Sanjeet SinghAvtaar Singh"], "doi": "10.3390/v15040916\n10.1016/0735-1097(89)90465-8\n10.1016/S0025-6196(12)61286-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.589663\n10.1053/euhj.1998.1085\n10.1016/0735-1097(90)90637-5\n10.1093/eurheartj/16.suppl_O.100\n10.1111/eci.12772\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.769489\n10.1186/s12968-022-00903-y\n10.1148/radiol.14132540\n10.1148/radiol.2461062179\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000118493.13323.81\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht210\n10.1002/ejhf.2496\n10.1002/ejhf.2190\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa575\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.06.007\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.05.004\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.3557\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.4916\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.3551\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049465\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30937-5\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31188-0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.031\n10.1038/s41598-023-28178-y\n10.1097/ACI.0000000000000888\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.02132\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01708\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01648\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105982\n10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.081\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.031\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317447\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.05.024\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.05.020\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049294\n10.3390/biomedicines10030654\n10.3390/biomedicines11010113\n10.3390/biomedicines10030702\n10.3390/jcm11092460\n10.3390/metabo12100889\n10.3390/biomedicines10020437\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.07.022\n10.23736/S2724-5683.22.06230-5\n10.1056/NEJMc2009020\n10.1161/01.cir.93.5.841\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.11.002\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa353\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv727\n10.1016/0735-1097(88)90213-6\n10.1007/s00414-011-0634-x\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.06.013\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.10.001\n10.1186/s12931-020-01479-w\n10.1042/CS20200899\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18295\n10.1126/science.1071059\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.536433\n10.1002/rmv.445\n10.4049/jimmunol.178.11.6710\n10.1080/0891693042000196200\n10.1038/nm960\n10.1161/01.RES.75.2.278\n10.1016/j.immuni.2006.06.009\n10.1128/jvi.68.8.5126-5132.1994\n10.1038/ni1497\n10.1084/jem.20052222\n10.1161/01.RES.85.6.551\n10.1007/s00246-006-1322-3\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80856-9\n10.4049/jimmunol.176.8.4748\n10.1161/01.RES.0000249405.13536.49\n10.1016/S1388-9842(02)00010-7\n10.1161/01.CIR.81.3.959\n10.4049/jimmunol.177.11.8234\n10.1172/JCI7132\n10.1080/08916930701619235\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb07932.x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa286\n10.1002/ejhf.1828\n10.1002/ehf2.12805\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa160\n10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X\n10.1093/ajcp/aqaa062\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31305-2\n10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107233\n10.7326/M20-2003\n10.7326/M20-2566\n10.1038/s41379-020-0536-x\n10.1038/s41379-021-00793-y\n10.1177/1066896920935195\n10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100434\n10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30243-5\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa664\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1096\n10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107300\n10.1056/NEJMp2015897\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa078\n10.1136/heartjnl-2016-309783\n10.28920/dhm52.3.217-220\n10.1038/s41591-020-1021-2\n10.1126/science.abb2762\n10.2174/1872213X13666190724112644\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa106\n10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1286\n10.1038/s41586-020-2355-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.051828\n10.1038/s41392-020-0148-4\n10.1016/j.jacc.2021.12.011\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368\n10.1016/S1053-2498(01)00408-9\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2005.01.042\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2005.08.073\n10.1016/j.healun.2004.06.015\n10.1007/s10741-020-10008-2\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl176\n10.1586/erc.09.69\n10.1002/ejhf.2082\n10.1136/hrt.2005.078402\n10.1002/14651858.CD004370.pub3\n10.1007/s00059-004-2628-7\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp249\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.062508\n10.1093/cid/ciaa478\n10.1056/NEJMoa2022926\n10.1101/2021.01.07.21249390\n10.1056/NEJMoa2028700\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6820\n10.1056/NEJMoa2030340\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6615\n10.1056/NEJMoa2028836\n10.1136/bmj.n84\n10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00676-0\n10.3390/ph14080738\n10.1097/MCC.0000000000000869\n10.1007/s10067-021-05911-4\n10.1093/cid/ciac724\n10.1001/jama.2020.17022\n10.1007/s00508-020-01805-8\n10.1001/jama.2020.16761\n10.1183/13993003.02808-2020\n10.1056/NEJMoa2021436\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173947\n10.1056/NEJMoa2007764\n10.1056/NEJMoa2116044\n10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02597-1\n10.1056/NEJMoa2118542\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.060632\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2013.10.011"}
{"title": "Chitosan: A Potential Biopolymer in Drug Delivery and Biomedical Applications.", "abstract": "Chitosan, a biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide derived from chitin, has surfaced as a material of promise for drug delivery and biomedical applications. Different chitin and chitosan extraction techniques can produce materials with unique properties, which can be further modified to enhance their bioactivities. Chitosan-based drug delivery systems have been developed for various routes of administration, including oral, ophthalmic, transdermal, nasal, and vaginal, allowing for targeted and sustained release of drugs. Additionally, chitosan has been used in numerous biomedical applications, such as bone regeneration, cartilage tissue regeneration, cardiac tissue regeneration, corneal regeneration, periodontal tissue regeneration, and wound healing. Moreover, chitosan has also been utilized in gene delivery, bioimaging, vaccination, and cosmeceutical applications. Modified chitosan derivatives have been developed to improve their biocompatibility and enhance their properties, resulting in innovative materials with promising potentials in various biomedical applications.

{"title": "Imageable AuNP-ECM Hydrogel Tissue Implants for Regenerative Medicine.", "abstract": "In myocardial infarction, a blockage in one of the coronary arteries leads to ischemic conditions in the left ventricle of the myocardium and, therefore, to significant death of contractile cardiac cells. This process leads to the formation of scar tissue, which reduces heart functionality. Cardiac tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary technology that treats the injured myocardium and improves its functionality. However, in many cases, mainly when employing injectable hydrogels, the treatment may be partial because it does not fully cover the diseased area and, therefore, may not be effective and even cause conduction disorders. Here, we report a hybrid nanocomposite material composed of gold nanoparticles and an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel. Such a hybrid hydrogel could support cardiac cell growth and promote cardiac tissue assembly. After injection of the hybrid material into the diseased area of the heart, it could be efficiently imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, as the scar tissue could also be detected by MRI, a distinction between the diseased area and the treatment could be made, providing information about the ability of the hydrogel to cover the scar. We envision that such a nanocomposite hydrogel may improve the accuracy of tissue engineering treatment.", "journal": "Pharmaceutics", "date": "2023-04-28", "authors": ["MalkaShilo", "Ester-SapirBaruch", "LiorWertheim", "HadasOved", "AssafShapira", "TalDvir"], "doi": "10.3390/pharmaceutics15041298\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.1161/JAHA.117.008407\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.25.2981\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1016/j.healun.2011.08.004\n10.1007/s11936-012-0184-7\n10.1016/j.healun.2015.10.023\n10.1126/science.1192033\n10.3390/gels8070423\n10.1073/pnas.1004097107\n10.1002/mabi.201800079\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.116.004058\n10.1002/advs.202102919\n10.1038/s41427-021-00330-y\n10.1016/j.cossms.2016.03.006\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00472\n10.3390/cancers13081825\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.021\n10.1039/D0CC00196A\n10.1039/df9511100055\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.02.002\n10.1016/j.inoche.2021.108746\n10.1002/adma.201803895\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.09.017\n10.1038/nmeth.3839\n10.1002/adma.200904179\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.004\n10.1002/bit.22361\n10.1097/01.rct.0000163571.79381.15\n10.3174/ajnr.A0905\n10.1186/1757-1626-2-9320\n10.1093/europace/eut147\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.01.014\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.05.062\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.811877\n10.1148/radiol.2433060417\n10.3389/fphys.2021.709230"}

{"title": "A Review on the Applications of Natural Biodegradable Nano Polymers in Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "As cardiac diseases, which mostly result in heart failure, are increasing rapidly worldwide, heart transplantation seems the only solution for saving lives. However, this practice is not always possible due to several reasons, such as scarcity of donors, rejection of organs from recipient bodies, or costly medical procedures. In the framework of nanotechnology, nanomaterials greatly contribute to the development of these cardiovascular scaffolds as they provide an easy regeneration of the tissues. Currently, functional nanofibers can be used in the production of stem cells and in the regeneration of cells and tissues. The small size of nanomaterials, however, leads to changes in their chemical and physical characteristics that could alter their interaction and exposure to stem cells with cells and tissues. This article aims to review the naturally occurring biodegradable nanomaterials that are used in cardiovascular tissue engineering for the development of cardiac patches, vessels, and tissues. Moreover, this article also provides an overview of cell sources used for cardiac tissue engineering, explains the anatomy and physiology of the human heart, and explores the regeneration of cardiac cells and the nanofabrication approaches used in cardiac tissue engineering as well as scaffolds.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-04-28", "authors": ["RabiaAziz",

{"title": "Chlorogenic Acid Attenuates Doxorubicin-Induced Oxidative Stress and Markers of Apoptosis in Cardiomyocytes via Nrf2/HO-1 and Dityrosine Signaling.", "abstract": "(1) Background: Doxorubicin (DOX) is extensively used for cancer treatments; however, its clinical application is limited because of its cardiotoxic adverse effects. A combination of DOX and agents with cardioprotective properties is an effective strategy to ameliorate DOX-related cardiotoxicity. Polyphenolic compounds are ideal for the investigation of novel cardioprotective agents. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an essential dietary polyphenol found in plants, has been previously reported to exert antioxidant, cardioprotective, and antiapoptotic properties. The current research evaluated CGA's in vivo cardioprotective properties in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the probable mechanisms underlying this protection. (2) Methods: CGA's cardioprotective properties were investigated in rats that were treated with CGA (100 mg/kg, p.o.) for fourteen days. The experimental model of cardiotoxicity was induced with a single intraperitoneal (15 mg/kg i.p.) injection of DOX on the 10th day. (3) Results: Treatment with CGA significantly improved the DOX-caused altered cardiac damage markers (LDH, CK-MB, and cTn-T), and a marked improvement in cardiac histopathological features accompanied this. DOX downregulated the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways, and the CGA reversed this effect. Consistently, caspase-3, an apoptotic-related marker, and dityrosine expression were suppressed, while Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions were elevated in the cardiac tissues of DOX-treated rats after treatment with the CGA. Furthermore, the recovery was confirmed by the downregulation of 8-OHdG and dityrosine (DT) expressions in immunohistochemical findings. (4) Conclusions: CGA demonstrated a considerable cardioprotective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. One of the possible mechanisms for these protective properties was the upregulation of the Nrf2/HO-1-dependent pathway and the downregulation of DT, which may ameliorate oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. These findings suggest that CGA may be cardioprotective, particularly in patients receiving DOX-based chemotherapy.", "journal": "Journal of personalized medicine", "date": "2023-04-28", "authors": ["BetulCicek", "AhmetHacimuftuoglu", "YesimYeni", "BetulDanisman", "MustafaOzkaraca", "BehzadMokhtare", "MecitKantarci", "MariosSpanakis", "DraganaNikitovic", "GeorgiosLazopoulos", "KonstantinosTsarouhas", "AristidisTsatsakis", "AliTaghizadehghalehjoughi"], "doi": "10.3390/jpm13040649\n10.1016/0306-4522(89)90424-7\n10.1016/j.cbi.2022.110008\n10.1038/srep44735\n10.1080/21655979.2021.2004980\n10.1024/0300-9831/a000582\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.05.006\n10.1038/s41419-021-03614-x\n10.1007/s00280-017-3413-7\n10.3390/jpm12101602\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109547\n10.1002/ptr.6557\n10.3390/jpm12122012\n10.1378/chest.14-0460\n10.1155/2020/3921796\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.017\n10.1016/j.taap.2018.06.004\n10.1007/s12012-014-9301-z\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.10.026\n10.1007/s12012-021-09694-7\n10.1007/s00018-016-2223-0\n10.1007/s12031-022-02078-8\n10.1007/s12012-020-09581-7\n10.1155/2020/5923572\n10.1007/s00414-014-1015-z\n10.1002/mas.20109\n10.1002/jbt.22030\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.09.001\n10.3390/ijms221810037\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.04.033\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.10.064\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.118.005234\n10.1093/annonc/mdp544\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00748-8\n10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106186\n10.3109/13880209.2015.1070879\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110773\n10.3390/jpm12020246\n10.3892/mmr.2022.12809\n10.3390/antiox11071225\n10.1186/s40959-019-0054-5\n10.1007/s10741-020-09977-1\n10.1016/0009-9120(94)00065-4\n10.1093/cvr/cvx183\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154407\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.12.013\n10.1155/2019/7901735\n10.1038/s41418-019-0372-z\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.01.006\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.09.028\n10.1155/2017/1521020\n10.3389/fphar.2022.863322\n10.3390/ijms21124527\n10.1155/2014/748524\n10.1186/s12964-022-00860-0\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2013.09.006\n10.3892/or.2020.7717"}

{"title": "Renal Denervation Helps Preserve the Ejection Fraction by Preserving Endocardial-Endothelial Function during Heart Failure.", "abstract": "Renal denervation (RDN) protects against hypertension, hypertrophy, and heart failure (HF); however, it is not clear whether RDN preserves ejection fraction (EF) during heart failure (HFpEF). To test this hypothesis, we simulated a chronic congestive cardiopulmonary heart failure (CHF) phenotype by creating an aorta-vena cava fistula (AVF) in the C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice. Briefly, there are four ways to create an experimental CHF: (1) myocardial infarction (MI), which is basically ligating the coronary artery by instrumenting and injuring the heart; (2) trans-aortic constriction (TAC) method, which mimics the systematic hypertension, but again constricts the aorta on top of the heart and, in fact, exposes the heart; (3) acquired CHF condition, promoted by dietary factors, diabetes, salt, diet, etc., but is multifactorial in nature; and finally, (4) the AVF, which remains the only one wherein AVF is created ~1 cm below the kidneys in which the aorta and vena cava share the common middle-wall. By creating the AVF fistula, the red blood contents enter the vena cava without an injury to the cardiac tissue. This model mimics or simulates the CHF phenotype, for example, during aging wherein with advancing age, the preload volume keeps increasing beyond the level that the aging heart can pump out due to the weakened cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, this procedure also involves the right ventricle to lung to left ventricle flow, thus creating an ideal condition for congestion. The heart in AVF transitions from preserved to reduced EF (i.e., HFpEF to HFrEF). In fact, there are more models of volume overload, such as the pacing-induced and mitral valve regurgitation, but these are also injurious models in nature. Our laboratory is one of the first laboratories to create and study the AVF phenotype in the animals. The RDN was created by treating the cleaned bilateral renal artery. After 6 weeks, blood, heart, and renal samples were analyzed for exosome, cardiac regeneration markers, and the renal cortex proteinases. Cardiac function was analyzed by echocardiogram (ECHO) procedure. The fibrosis was analyzed with a trichrome staining method. The results suggested that there was a robust increase in the exosomes' level in AVF blood, suggesting a compensatory systemic response during AVF-CHF. During AVF, there was no change in the cardiac eNOS, Wnt1, or \u03b2-catenin; however, during RDN, there were robust increases in the levels of eNOS, Wnt1, and \u03b2-catenin compared to the sham group. As expected in HFpEF, there was perivascular fibrosis, hypertrophy, and pEF. Interestingly, increased levels of eNOS suggested that despite fibrosis, the NO generation was higher and that it most likely contributed to pEF during HF. The RDN intervention revealed an increase in renal cortical caspase 8 and a decrease in caspase 9. Since caspase 8 is protective and caspase 9 is apoptotic, we suggest that RDN protects against the renal stress and apoptosis. It should be noted that others have demonstrated a role of vascular endothelium in preserving the ejection by cell therapy intervention. In the light of foregoing evidence, our findings also suggest that RDN is cardioprotective during HFpEF via preservation of the eNOS and accompanied endocardial-endothelial function.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-04-28", "authors": ["SathnurPushpakumar", "MahavirSingh", "YutingZheng", "Oluwaseun EAkinterinwa", "Sri Prakash LMokshagundam", "UtpalSen", "Dinesh KKalra", "Suresh CTyagi"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24087302\n10.1016/0735-1097(95)00381-9\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.1997.129150000.x\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00118-7\n10.1016/S0002-9149(00)01165-6\n10.1016/S0002-9149(00)01393-X\n10.7326/0003-4819-137-8-200210150-00006\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehm554\n10.1016/j.ehj.2004.06.006\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.022\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.04.064\n10.1056/NEJMoa052256\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.302922\n10.1152/ajpheart.00680.2017\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041886\n10.1016/j.jchf.2018.03.006\n10.1161/JAHA.119.012190\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003330\n10.1161/JAHA.119.014669\n10.1161/JAHA.120.018574\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.313572\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.10.031\n10.1093/cvr/cvab009\n10.1002/ejhf.2209\n10.1002/ehf2.13067\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102862\n10.1073/pnas.1514250112\n10.3389/fphys.2021.745328\n10.31083/j.rcm2302069\n10.1172/JCI114941\n10.1152/ajpregu.00490.2013\n10.1016/S0014-2999(01)01542-4\n10.1681/ASN.2021060757\n10.1159/000522377\n10.1152/ajprenal.00372.2021\n10.1074/jbc.H120.013321\n10.1152/ajpheart.00287.2022\n10.1007/s11255-022-03207-3\n10.31128/AJGP-03-19-4873\n10.1038/s41598-017-13105-9\n10.1111/apha.12793\n10.1007/s00592-020-01532-6\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.04.041\n10.1161/JAHA.114.001353\n10.1080/10641963.2020.1833022\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31829e8807\n10.1161/JAHA.117.007312\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1961.200.6.1157\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.5.H2071\n10.1152/ajpheart.00483.2001\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0132\n10.1038/s41569-022-00708-7\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19961101)63:2<185::AID-JCB6>3.0.CO;2-U\n10.1002/jcb.20581\n10.2307/2531456"}
{"title": "The roles of FHL2 in cancer.", "abstract": "LIM domain protein 2, also known as LIM protein FHL2, is a member of the LIM-only family. Due to its LIM domain protein characteristics, FHL2 is capable of interacting with various proteins and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, cell growth, and signal transduction in muscle and cardiac tissue. In recent years, mounting evidence has indicated that the FHLs protein family is closely associated with the development and occurrence of human tumors. On the one hand, FHL2 acts as a tumor suppressor by down-regulating in tumor tissue and effectively inhibiting tumor development by limiting cell proliferation. On the other hand, FHL2 serves as an oncoprotein by up-regulating in tumor tissue and binding to multiple transcription factors to suppress cell apoptosis, stimulate cell proliferation and migration, and promote tumor progression.

{"title": "Epigenetic modifier alpha-ketoglutarate modulates aberrant gene body methylation and hydroxymethylation marks in diabetic heart.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Hyperglycemic myocardial microenvironment significantly alters chromatin architecture and the transcriptome, resulting in aberrant activation of signaling pathways in a diabetic heart. Epigenetic marks play vital roles in transcriptional reprogramming during the development of DCM. The current study is aimed to profile genome-wide DNA (hydroxy)methylation patterns in the hearts of control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and decipher the effect of modulation of DNA methylation by alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), a TET enzyme cofactor, on the progression of DCM.\nDiabetes was induced in male adult Wistar rats with an intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Diabetic and vehicle control animals were randomly divided into groups with/without AKG treatment. Cardiac function was monitored by performing cardiac catheterization. Global methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) patterns were mapped in the Left ventricular tissue of control and diabetic rats with the help of an enrichment-based (h)MEDIP-sequencing technique by using antibodies specific for 5mC and 5hmC. Sequencing data were validated by performing (h)MEDIP-qPCR analysis at the gene-specific level, and gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. The mRNA and protein expression of enzymes involved in the DNA methylation and demethylation cycle were analyzed by qPCR and western blotting. Global 5mC and 5hmC levels were also assessed in high glucose-treated DNMT3B knockdown H9c2 cells.\nWe found the increased expression of DNMT3B, MBD2, and MeCP2 with a concomitant accumulation of 5mC and 5hmC, specifically in gene body regions of diabetic rat hearts compared to the control. Calcium signaling was the most significantly affected pathway by cytosine modifications in the diabetic heart. Additionally, hypermethylated gene body regions were associated with Rap1, apelin, and phosphatidyl inositol signaling, while metabolic pathways were most affected by hyperhydroxymethylation. AKG supplementation in diabetic rats reversed aberrant methylation patterns and restored cardiac function. Hyperglycemia also increased 5mC and 5hmC levels in H9c2 cells, which was normalized by DNMT3B knockdown or AKG supplementation.\nThis study demonstrates that reverting hyperglycemic damage to cardiac tissue might be possible by erasing adverse epigenetic signatures by supplementing epigenetic modulators such as AKG along with an existing antidiabetic treatment regimen.", "journal": "Epigenetics & chromatin", "date": "2023-04-27", "authors": ["RohiniDhat", "DattatrayMongad", "SivarupaRaji", "SilpaArkat", "Nitish RMahapatra", "NishantSinghal", "Sandhya LSitasawad"], "doi": "10.1186/s13072-023-00489-4\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht108\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311586\n10.1161/JAHA.121.022308\n10.1186/s12933-017-0506-x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.679597\n10.1186/s12933-016-0424-3\n10.3389/fgene.2022.848364\n10.1371/journal.pone.0276076\n10.1038/s41467-017-02762-z\n10.1038/s41392-022-01055-2\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.08.021.\n10.1038/npp.2012.112\n10.2217/epi.15.39\n10.1186/s13072-020-00339-7\n10.1038/nrg3080\n10.1186/s13256-018-1690-3\n10.1136/bcr-2019-231903\n10.1111/bcp.14211\n10.1016/S1521-6616(03)00206-7\n10.1038/nature13981\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA\n10.1002/mnfr.201800970\n10.1093/hmg/ddt453\n10.1038/nature10102\n10.1038/nature10442\n10.1089/dna.2010.1094\n10.1007/s12265-013-9482-z\n10.1128/MCB.25.14.6267-6278.2005\n10.1152/ajpheart.00758.2018\n10.1038/ncpcardio1347\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.007\n10.1016/s0952-3278(97)90498-1\n10.1016/j.lfs.2011.01.023\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050960\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00557\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.10156\n10.1152/ajpcell.00157.2020\n10.1016/j.diabres.2017.08.018\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.001\n10.1161/JAHA.118.010012\n10.2337/db14-0231\n10.1177/0192623312438738\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.06.019\n10.1038/nature09303\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu372\n10.1038/nprot.2012.012\n10.3389/fncel.2019.00095"}

{"title": "Protective effects of calorie restriction and 17-\u03b2 estradiol on cardiac hypertrophy in ovariectomized obese rats.", "abstract": "Obesity and menopause lead to cardiovascular diseases. Calorie restriction (CR) can modulate estrogen deficiency and obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. The protective effects of CR and estradiol on cardiac hypertrophy in ovariectomized obese rats were explored in this study. The adult female Wistar rats were divided into sham and ovariectomized (OVX) groups that received a high-fat diet (60% HFD) or standard diet (SD) or 30% CR for 16 weeks, and then, 1mg/kg E2 (17-\u03b2 estradiol) was injected intraperitoneally every 4 days for four weeks in OVX-rats. Hemodynamic parameters were evaluated before and after each diet. Heart tissues were collected for biochemical, histological, and molecular analysis. HFD consumption led to weight gain in sham and OVX rats. In contrast, CR and E2 led to body weight loss in these animals. Also, heart weight (HW), heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio, and left ventricular weight (LVW) were enhanced in OVX rats that received SD and HFD. E2 reduced these indexes in both diet conditions but reduction effects of CR were seen only in HFD groups. HFD and SD feeding increased hemodynamic parameters, ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) mRNA expression, and TGF-\u03b21(transforming growth factor-beta 1) protein level in the OVX animals, while CR and E2 reduced these factors. Cardiomyocyte diameter and hydroxyproline content were increased in the OVX-HFD groups. Nevertheless, CR and E2 decreased these indicators. The results showed that CR and E2 treatment reduced obesity-induced-cardiac hypertrophy in ovariectomized groups (20% and 24% respectively). CR appears to have almost as reducing effects as estrogen therapy on cardiac hypertrophy. The findings suggest that CR can be considered a therapeutic candidate for postmenopausal cardiovascular disease.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2023-04-25", "authors": ["ZahraHajializadeh", "MohammadKhaksari", "ShahriarDabiri", "FatemehDarvishzadeh Mahani", "AlirezaRaji-Amirhasani", "Mohammad AbbasBejeshk"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0282089\n10.1016/j.regpep.2010.12.009\n10.1126/science.1112062\n10.7326/0003-4819-67-1-48\n10.1038/sj.jhh.1002006\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.010908.163156\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050802\n10.1210/en.2008-0133\n10.1161/hc3601.095577\n10.1097/gme.0b013e318250a287\n10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120367\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282f624a0\n10.1016/j.peptides.2018.05.012\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.06.029\n10.1172/JCI11273\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000144801.09557.4c\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.04.035\n10.1007/s11739-008-0207-2\n10.1161/01.cir.0000020689.12472.e0\n10.1007/s00395-007-0689-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00578.2001\n10.1097/00004872-200110000-00027\n10.1177/147323000403200109\n10.12659/msmbr.907162\n10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009\n10.18632/aging.100581\n10.1093/cvr/cvq273\n10.1139/cjpp-2012-0359\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.028\n10.1016/j.brainres.2015.05.017\n10.3390/nu13010274\n10.1007/s00424-015-1702-8\n10.1016/j.nut.2022.111588\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2020.577352\n10.1016/j.mad.2019.111198\n10.1038/ijo.2008.25\n10.1017/S0007114515000100\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv509\n10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.12.003\n10.1196/annals.1396.037\n10.15252/emmm.202114418\n10.1155/2015/787063\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119411\n10.2337/db16-0607\n10.1210/en.2014-1342\n10.1007/BF03346563\n10.1007/s11011-021-00884-4\n10.1016/0018-506x(77)90001-0\n10.1007/s00394-011-0266-4\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.2011.01377.x\n10.1530/JOE-20-0562\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.10.003\n10.1016/s0021-9150(98)00252-4\n10.1111/j.1524-6175.2005.04087.x\n10.1038/sj.jhh.1000689\n10.1097/00000441-200104000-00003\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.04.005\n10.1007/s00109-013-1103-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.927764\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02093\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.179457\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2015.04.016\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.08.069\n10.1097/GME.0000000000000862\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072959\n10.1186/1475-2840-13-36\n10.1586/14779072.3.4.647\n10.1016/j.regpep.2003.10.007\n10.1007/s13105-013-0289-9"}
{"title": "SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with anti-desmoglein 2 autoantibody detection.", "abstract": "Post-acute cardiac sequelae, following SARS-CoV-2 infection, are well recognized as complications of COVID-19. We have previously shown the persistence of autoantibodies against antigens in skin, muscle, and heart in individuals following severe COVID-19; the most common staining on skin tissue displayed an inter-cellular cement pattern consistent with antibodies against desmosomal proteins. Desmosomes play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. For this reason, we analyzed desmosomal protein levels and the presence of anti-desmoglein (DSG) 1, 2, and 3 antibodies in acute and convalescent sera from patients with COVID-19 of differing clinical severity. We find increased levels of DSG2 protein in sera from acute COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we find that DSG2 autoantibody levels are increased significantly in convalescent sera following severe COVID-19 but not in hospitalized patients recovering from influenza infection or healthy controls. Levels of autoantibody in sera from patients with severe COVID-19 were comparable to levels in patients with non-COVID-19-associated cardiac disease, potentially identifying DSG2 autoantibodies as a novel biomarker for cardiac damage. To determine if there was any association between severe COVID-19 and DSG2, we stained post-mortem cardiac tissue from patients who died from COVID-19 infection. This confirmed DSG2 protein within the intercalated discs and disruption of the intercalated disc between cardiomyocytes in patients who died from COVID-19. Our results reveal the potential for DSG2 protein and autoimmunity to DSG2 to contribute to unexpected pathologies associated with COVID-19 infection.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental immunology", "date": "2023-04-25", "authors": ["Kerensa EWard", "LoraSteadman", "Abid RKarim", "Gary MReynolds", "MatthewPugh", "WinnieChua", "Sian EFaustini", "TonnyVeenith", "Ryan SThwaites", "Peter J MOpenshaw", "Mark TDrayson", "Adrian MShields", "Adam FCunningham", "David CWraith", "Alex GRichter"], "doi": "10.1093/cei/uxad046\n10.1111/cei.13623\n10.1159/000051827\n10.1016/B978-0-12-394311-8.00005-4\n10.1038/nrdp.2017.26\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000974\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.055890\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy567\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.583674\n10.4137/CMC.S10940\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehac031\n10.1038/s41591-022-01689-3\n10.7759/cureus.23193\n10.1016/j.cmi.2022.03.021\n10.1007/7651_2017_44\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000645\n10.1111/all.15302\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.831849\n10.1016/s0049-0172(98)80047-4\n10.1152/ajpgi.00239.2009\n10.1093/cvr/cvs219\n10.1038/s41374-022-00783-x\n10.1155/2022/9371818\n10.1016/j.ccep.2021.10.001\n10.1002/mc.22644\n10.1007/s10456-016-9520-y\n10.1091/mbc.e07-05-0426\n10.1128/JVI.00747-20\n10.1038/nm.2270"}
{"title": "Post-Maturation Reinforcement of 3D-Printed Vascularized Cardiac Tissues.", "abstract": "Despite advances in biomaterials engineering, a large gap remains between the weak mechanical properties that can be achieved with natural materials and the strength of synthetic materials. Here, a method is presented for reinforcing an engineered cardiac tissue fabricated from differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an extracellular matrix (ECM)-based hydrogel in a manner that is fully biocompatible. The reinforcement occurs as a post-fabrication step, which allows for the use of 3D-printing technology to generate thick, fully cellularized, and vascularized cardiac tissues. After tissue assembly and during the maturation process in a soft hydrogel, a small, tissue-penetrating reinforcer is deployed, leading to a significant increase in the tissue's mechanical properties.

The cardiovascular protective effects of several DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown in preclinical studies; however, the detailed influence of DPP-4 inhibitors on diabetic pathological alterations in cardiac tissue has not yet been elucidated.\nWe combined laboratory-based experiments and bioinformatics techniques to identify suitable candidate targets with significant biological pathways. Mice with streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency diabetic model were utilized for in\u2009vivo experiments. Mice were euthanized at 24\u2009weeks after the induction of diabetes; linagliptin intervention was carried out for 4\u2009weeks before euthanasia. Microarray analysis of heart samples was carried out.\nMice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, but not control mice, showed cardiac fibrosis with an endothelial-mesenchymal transition program, and myocardial fiber and sarcomere disruption; linagliptin alleviated these diabetes-associated pathological alterations without altering blood glucose levels. Bioinformatics analysis utilizing a microarray dataset identified 10 hub genes that were confirmed to have human disease relevance by Gene Expression Omnibus analysis. Among these hub genes, we focused on the Sox9-necroptosis axis as a therapeutic target in diabetic hearts. Indeed, diabetic mice showed the induction of necroptosis-associated genes and the phosphorylation of RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein.\nLinagliptin showed excellent heart protection in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes associated with alterations in human disease-relevant hub genes.

{"title": "Comprehensive Characterization of Endogenous Phospholamban Proteoforms Enabled by Photocleavable Surfactant and Top-down Proteomics.", "abstract": "Top-down mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful tool for analyzing intact proteins and their associated post-translational modification (PTMs). In particular, membrane proteins play critical roles in cellular functions and represent the largest class of drug targets. However, the top-down MS characterization of endogenous membrane proteins remains challenging, mainly due to their intrinsic hydrophobicity and low abundance. Phospholamban (PLN) is a regulatory membrane protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is essential for regulating cardiac muscle contraction. PLN has diverse combinatorial PTMs and their dynamic regulation has significant influence on cardiac contractility and disease. Herein, we have developed a rapid and robust top-down proteomics method enabled by a photocleavable anionic surfactant, Azo, for the extraction and comprehensive characterization of endogenous PLN from cardiac tissue. We employed a two-pronged top-down MS approach using an online reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) method on a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS and a direct infusion method via an ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS. We have comprehensively characterized the sequence and combinatorial PTMs of endogenous human cardiac PLN. We have shown the site-specific localization of phosphorylation to Ser16 and Thr17 by MS/MS for the first time and the localization of S-palmitoylation to Cys36. Taken together, we have developed a streamlined top-down targeted proteomics method for comprehensive characterization of combinatorial PTMs in PLN toward better understanding the role of PLN in cardiac contractility.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2023-04-24", "authors": ["Holden TRogers", "David SRoberts", "Eli JLarson", "Jake AMelby", "Kalina JRossler", "Austin VCarr", "Kyle ABrown", "YingGe"], "doi": "10.1101/2023.04.12.536120"}
{"title": "[Inhibition of glutaminolysis alleviates myocardial fibrosis induced by angiotensin II].", "abstract": "The present study was aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of glutaminolysis of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in hypertension-induced myocardial fibrosis. C57BL/6J mice were administered with a chronic infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II, 1.6 mg/kg per d) with a micro-osmotic pump to induce myocardial fibrosis. Masson staining was used to evaluate myocardial fibrosis. The mice were intraperitoneally injected with BPTES (12.5 mg/kg), a glutaminase 1 (GLS1)-specific inhibitor, to inhibit glutaminolysis simultaneously. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect protein expression levels of GLS1, Collagen I and Collagen III in cardiac tissue. Neonatal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat CFs were treated with 4 mmol/L glutamine (Gln) or BPTES (5 \u03bcmol/L) with or without Ang II (0.4 \u03bcmol/L) stimulation. The CFs were also treated with 2 mmol/L \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) under the stimulation of Ang II and BPTES. Wound healing test and CCK-8 were used to detect CFs migration and proliferation respectively. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression levels of GLS1, Collagen I and Collagen III. The results showed that blood pressure, heart weight and myocardial fibrosis were increased in Ang II-treated mice, and GLS1 expression in cardiac tissue was also significantly up-regulated. Gln significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, mRNA and protein expression of GLS1, Collagen I and Collagen III in the CFs with or without Ang II stimulation, whereas BPTES significantly decreased the above indices in the CFs. \u03b1-KG supplementation reversed the inhibitory effect of BPTES on the CFs under Ang II stimulation. Furthermore, in vivo intraperitoneal injection of BPTES alleviated cardiac fibrosis of Ang II-treated mice. In conclusion, glutaminolysis plays an important role in the process of cardiac fibrosis induced by Ang II.

In this study, we discovered that mice with SAH exhibited significant cardiac injuries, such as extended QT and QTc intervals, cardiac fibrosis, and reduced cardiac ejection fractions. This phenomenon was accompanied by increased galectin-3 expression in the cardiac ventricle and can be reversed by galectin-3 inhibitor TD139. Interestingly, we also observed increased co-expression of galectin-3 in macrophage within the heart tissue of SAH mice. Additionally, when macrophage activation was suppressed using the beta-blocker propranolol, cardiac function improved, and galectin-3 expression in the cardiac tissue decreased.

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of ultrasound-targeted destruction of Sirt3-loaded cationic microbubbles in a large animal model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Pathological cardiac hypertrophy occurs in response to numerous increased afterload stimuli and precedes irreversible heart failure (HF). Therefore, therapies that ameliorate pathological cardiac hypertrophy are urgently required. Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) is a main member of histone deacetylase class III and is a crucial anti-oxidative stress agent. Therapeutically enhancing the Sirt3 transfection efficiency in the heart would broaden the potential clinical application of Sirt3. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) is a prospective, noninvasive, repeatable, and targeted gene delivery technique. In the present study, we explored the potential and safety of UTMD as a delivery tool for Sirt3 in hypertrophic heart tissues using adult male Bama miniature pigs. Pigs were subjected to ear vein delivery of human Sirt3 together with UTMD of cationic microbubbles (CMBs). Fluorescence imaging, western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the targeted destruction of ultrasonic CMBs in cardiac tissues greatly boosted Sirt3 delivery. Overexpression of Sirt3 ameliorated oxidative stress and partially improved the diastolic function and prevented the apoptosis and profibrotic response. Lastly, our data revealed that Sirt3 may regulate the potential transcription of catalase and MnSOD through Foxo3a. Combining the advantages of ultrasound CMBs with preclinical hypertrophy large animal models for gene delivery, we established a classical hypertrophy model as well as a strategy for the targeted delivery of genes to hypertrophic heart tissues. Since oxidative stress, fibrosis and apoptosis are indispensable in the evolution of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, our findings suggest that Sirt3 is a promising therapeutic option for these diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a central prepathology of heart failure and is seen to eventually precede it. Feasible targets that may prevent or reverse disease progression are scarce and urgently needed. In this study, we developed surface-filled lipid octafluoropropane gas core cationic microbubbles that could target the release of human Sirt3 reactivating the endogenous Sirt3 in hypertrophic hearts and protect against oxidative stress in a pig model of cardiac hypertrophy induced by aortic banding. Sirt3-CMBs may enhance cardiac diastolic function and ameliorate fibrosis and apoptosis. Our work provides a classical cationic lipid-based, UTMD-mediated Sirt3 delivery system for the treatment of Sirt3 in patients with established cardiac hypertrophy, as well as a promising therapeutic target to combat pathological cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2023-04-21", "authors": ["XionghaiQin", "PeianCai", "ChangLiu", "KegongChen", "XingpeiJiang", "WeiChen", "JiarouLi", "XuanJiao", "ErliangGuo", "YixiuYu", "LuSun", "HaiTian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2023.04.020"}
{"title": "Direct and indirect cardiovascular and cardiometabolic sequelae of the combined anti-retroviral therapy on people living with HIV.", "abstract": "With reports of its emergence as far back as the early 1900s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become one of the deadliest and most difficult viruses to treat in the era of modern medicine. Although not always effective, HIV treatment has evolved and improved substantially over the past few decades. Despite the major advancements in the efficacy of HIV therapy, there are mounting concerns about the physiological, cardiovascular, and neurological sequelae of current treatments. The objective of this review is to (Blattner et al., Cancer Res., 1985, 45(9 Suppl), 4598s-601s) highlight the different forms of antiretroviral therapy, how they work, and any effects that they may have on the cardiovascular health of patients living with HIV, and to (Mann et al., J Infect Dis, 1992, 165(2), 245-50) explore the new, more common therapeutic combinations currently available and their effects on cardiovascular and neurological health. We executed a computer-based literature search using databases such as PubMed to look for relevant, original articles that were published after 1998 to current year. Articles that had relevance, in any capacity, to the field of HIV therapy and its intersection with cardiovascular and neurological health were included. Amongst currently used classes of HIV therapies, protease inhibitors (PIs) and combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) were found to have an overall negative effect on the cardiovascular system related to increased cardiac apoptosis, reduced repair mechanisms, block hyperplasia/hypertrophy, decreased ATP production in the heart tissue, increased total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, and gross endothelial dysfunction. The review of Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTI), Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI), and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI) revealed mixed results, in which both positive and negative effects on cardiovascular health were observed.

The HRV indices were lower than the reference values. An intergroup comparison identified no statistically significant differences in the mean normal-to-normal (NN) interval, standard deviation of the NN interval, or root mean square of successive differences in NN intervals. The COVID(+) group had an increased low frequency (P = 0.05), reduced high frequency (P = 0.045), and increased low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio (P = 0.048). There was a weak positive correlation between LF/HF and length of stay in the COVID(+) group.\nPatients who received mechanical ventilation had lower overall HRV indices.

{"title": "Osteochondral Tissue Engineering Dilemma: Scaffolding Trends in Regenerative Medicine.", "abstract": "Orthopedic surgeons face a lot of difficulties in managing and repairing osteochondral defects. Damaged articular cartilage and the subchondral bone underneath are both present in osteochondral defects. The demands of the bone, cartilage, and the contact between the bone and the cartilage must be taken into consideration while repairing an osteochondral defect. Only palliative, not curative, therapeutic interventions are now available for the healing of osteochondral abnormalities. With its ability to successfully rebuild bone, cartilage, and the junction between bone and cartilage, tissue engineering has been recognized as an effective substitute. In correlation, mechanical stress and physical processes are commonly applied to the osteochondral area. Therefore, the ability of chondrocytes and osteoblasts to regenerate is influenced by bioactive molecules and the physicochemical characteristics of the surrounding matrix. The treatment of osteochondral disorders is said to benefit from the use of stem cells as an alternative intervention. In the field of tissue engineering, various approaches have been used such as the direct implantation of scaffolding materials at the site of tissue injury in patients, either alone or loaded with cells and bioactive molecules at the target site to imitate the natural extracellular matrix. Despite the extensive use and advancements of tissue-engineered biomaterials such as natural and synthetic polymer-based scaffolds, their repair capacity is limited due to challenges in combating antigenicity, designed to simulate in vivo microenvironment, and conducting mechanical or metabolic characteristics comparable to native organs/tissues. This study explores numerous osteochondral tissue engineering methodologies focusing on scaffold design, material varieties, manufacturing techniques, and functional features. This review is focused on recent breakthroughs in bioactive scaffolds that aid osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation for bone and cartilage repair. The topic will cover fundamental anatomy, osteochondral repair methodologies and obstacles, cell selection, biochemical variables, and bioactive materials, as well as the design and manufacture of bioactive scaffolds. Additionally, we focus on the concept and construction of decellularized scaffolds, and the fabrication of dECM scaffolds in tissue engineering from various skin, bone, nerve, heart tissue, lung, liver, and kidney, and their application in osteochondral regeneration.", "journal": "Stem cell reviews and reports", "date": "2023-04-19", "authors": ["FaizaRamzan", "AsmatSalim", "IrfanKhan"], "doi": "10.1007/s12015-023-10545-x\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.05.017\n10.1002/jbm.a.33206\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.805299"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective role of a magnolol and honokiol complex in the prevention of doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity in adult rats.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOXO) induces marked cardiotoxicity, though increased oxidative stress while there are some documents related with cardioprotective effects of some antioxidants against organ-toxicity during cancer treatment. Although magnolia bark has some antioxidant-like effects, its action in DOXO-induced heart dysfunction has not be shown clearly. Therefore, here, we aimed to investigate the cardioprotective action of a magnolia bark extract with active component magnolol and honokiol\u00a0complex (MAHOC; 100\u00a0mg/kg) in DOXO-treated rat hearts. One group of adult male Wistar rats was injected with DOXO (DOXO-group; a cumulative dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg in 2-week) or saline (CON-group). One group of DOXO-treated rats was administered with MAHOC before DOXO (Pre-MAHOC group; 2-week) while another group was administered with MAHOC following the 2-week DOXO (Post-MAHOC group). MAHOC administration, before or after DOXO, provided full survival of animals during 12-14\u00a0weeks, and significant recoveries in the systemic parameters of animals such as plasma levels of manganese and zinc, total oxidant and antioxidant statuses, and also systolic and diastolic blood pressures. This treatment also significantly improved heart function including recoveries in end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-systolic volume, heart rate, cardiac output, and prolonged P-wave duration. Furthermore, the MAHOC administrations improved the structure of left ventricles such as recoveries in loss of myofibrils, degenerative nuclear changes, fragmentation of cardiomyocytes, and interstitial edema. Biochemical analysis in the heart tissues provided the important cardioprotective effect of MAHOC on the redox regulation of the heart, such as improvements in activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, and oxygen radical-absorbing capacity of the heart together with recoveries in other systemic parameters of animals, while all of these benefits were observed in the Pre-MAHOC treatment group, more prominently. Overall, one can point out the beneficial antioxidant effects of MAHOC in chronic heart diseases as a supporting and complementing agent to the conventional therapies.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2023-04-19", "authors": ["IremAktay", "Ceylan VerdaBitirim", "YusufOlgar", "AysegulDurak", "ErkanTuncay", "DenizBillur", "Kamil CanAkcali", "BelmaTuran"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-023-04728-w\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318172\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000041431.57222.AF\n10.1093/qjmed/hcn160\n10.3389/fcvm.2015.00029\n10.3945/ajcn.113.058263\n10.2105/AJPH.90.9.1409\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.10.098\n10.3988/jcn.2014.10.2.140\n10.1093/jn/133.8.2650\n10.1097/MCA.0000000000000187\n10.1038/s41598-022-06698-3\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.601364\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01596-0\n10.1016/j.lfs.2003.09.047\n10.3389/fphar.2022.806300\n10.1021/np9702446\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.109886\n10.1248/bpb.33.427\n10.1016/j.biochi.2011.06.012\n10.1093/cdn/nzy009\n10.12659/MSM.910350\n10.3389/fphar.2021.632767\n10.1016/0006-2952(94)90187-2\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.1996.tb01753.x\n10.1155/2021/5523516\n10.1016/j.echo.2011.01.018\n10.1016/j.cjca.2016.06.002\n10.1515/CCLM.2005.140\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.07.011\n10.1177/0960327107076885\n10.1038/srep18314\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.06.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00253.2017\n10.1159/000265166\n10.1016/s0022-2828(87)80392-9\n10.1002/cncr.11407\n10.1088/0967-3334/36/4/727\n10.1111/bph.13791\n10.1080/13880209.2017.1299768\n10.1515/jbcpp-2018-0212\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064711\n10.1093/toxsci/kfx267\n10.11152/mu.2013.2066.151.ms1ddc2\n10.1369/00221554221101661\n10.1016/j.tox.2010.01.019\n10.1139/cjpp-2017-0054\n10.1016/j.pcad.2006.10.002\n10.1186/s40959-019-0054-5\n10.7326/0003-4819-91-5-710\n10.1093/jnci/djp440\n10.1161/01.RES.87.3.241\n10.1093/jn/nxaa144\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)35746-0\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101394\n10.3390/curroncol29050241\n10.1016/j.repc.2020.12.015\n10.1007/s11010-005-9003-8\n10.1155/2022/5096825\n10.3389/fneur.2013.00130\n10.1016/j.jep.2016.10.016\n10.1155/2014/965954\n10.3390/ijms221810050\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2021.127952\n10.1371/journal.pone.0120366\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.09.020\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.01.012\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00053\n10.1038/ncomms7656\n10.1159/000028324"}
{"title": "Impairment of substrate-mediated mitochondrial respiration in cardiac cells by chloroquine.", "abstract": "Chloroquine (CQ) has a long clinical history as an anti-malarial agent and also being used for the treatment of other infections and autoimmune diseases. Recently, this lysosomotropic agent and its derivatives are also been tested as adjuncts alongside conventional anti-cancer treatments in combinatorial therapies. However, their reported cardiotoxicity tends to raise concern over their indiscriminate use. Even though the influence of CQ and its derivatives on cardiac mitochondria is extensively studied in disease models, their impact on cardiac mitochondrial respiration under physiological conditions remains inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of CQ on cardiac mitochondrial respiration using both in-vitro and in-vivo model systems. Using high-resolution respirometry in isolated cardiac mitochondria from male C57BL/6 mice treated with intraperitoneal injection of 10\u00a0mg/kg/day of CQ for 14\u00a0days, CQ was found to impair substrate-mediated mitochondrial respiration in cardiac tissue. In an in-vitro model of H9C2 cardiomyoblasts, incubation with 50\u00a0\u00b5M of CQ for 24\u00a0h disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, produced mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial respiration and induced superoxide generation. Altogether, our study results indicate that CQ has a deleterious impact on cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics which in turn suggests that CQ treatment could be an added burden, especially in patients affected with diseases with underlying cardiac complications. As CQ is an inhibitor of the lysosomal pathway, the observed effect could be an outcome of the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria due to autophagy inhibition.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2023-04-19", "authors": ["SivasailamAshok", "Sasikala RajendranRaji", "ShankarappaManjunatha", "GopalaSrinivas"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-023-04740-0\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00408\n10.1016/0002-9343(83)91265-2\n10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0086\n10.1128/AAC.32.6.793\n10.1186/s13046-018-0938-5\n10.3892/ijo.2019.4824\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.09.034\n10.1007/s40264-018-0689-4\n10.1007/s10557-018-06847-9\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106057\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1051295\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246108\n10.1016/S1534-5807(04)00099-1\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182646cb1\n10.1016/j.cophys.2017.11.001\n10.14814/phy2.12413\n10.1016/j.rec.2017.04.017\n10.1111/neup.12520\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.11.004\n10.1016/j.humpath.2007.06.013\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.1986.tb04635.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310078\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173918\n10.1159/000477889\n10.1159/000438580\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1074/jbc.M808515200\n10.1080/15548627.2018.1474314\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.104\n10.1038/s41419-018-0708-5\n10.1016/j.redox.2012.11.008\n10.1007/s12013-022-01123-y\n10.1074/jbc.M210943200\n10.1378/chest.06-1146\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.030\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.05.008"}

After resuscitation, culture, and identification of hiPSCs, they were inoculated onto Matrigel-coated polycaprolactone (PCL). After 24\u00a0h, cell growth was observed by DAPI under a fluorescence microscope and the stemness of hiPSCs was identified by OCT4 fluorescence. After fixation, scanning electron microscopy was performed to observe the morphology of cells on the patch surface. On days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of culture, cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and a curve was drawn to observe cell growth and proliferation. After co-culture with Matrigel-covered PCL for 24\u00a0h, hiPSCs were divided into control and CDM3 groups, and cultured for an additional 6 d. On the eighth day, cell growth was observed by DAPI under a fluorescence microscope, hiPSC stemness was identified by OCT4 fluorescence, and cardiomyocytes were identified by cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and \u03b1-actin expression. hiPSCs co-cultured with Matrigel-covered PCL for 24\u00a0h emitted green fluorescence indicating OCT4, showing that hiPSCs maintained their stemness on Matrigel-covered PCL scaffolds. DAPI emitted blue fluorescence, indicating that cells grew clonally with uniform cell morphology. Scanning electron microscopy showed that hiPSCs adhered and grew on PCL covered with Matrigel, with clearly visible cell outlines indicating normal morphology. Assessment of cell viability by the CCK-8 method showed that hiPSCs proliferated and grew on PCL scaffolds covered with Matrigel. After 6 d of culture, immunofluorescence showed that control group hiPSCs highly expressed the stem cell marker OCT4 but not myocardial markers cTnT or \u03b1-actin. In contrast, notable expression of myocardial markers cTnT and \u03b1-actin but not OCT4 occurred in the CDM3 group. hiPSCs can proliferate and grow on PCL scaffolds covered with Matrigel. Under the influence of CDM3, hiPSCs differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells, allowing the preliminary preparation of myocardial patches that can provide a better method for clinical treatment of myocardial infarction.", "journal": "In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

{"title": "316Engineered extracellular vesicle-mediated delivery of miR-199a-3p increases the viability of 3D-printed cardiac patches.", "abstract": "In recent years, extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is employed for engineering cardiac patches (CP) due to its ability to assemble complex structures from hydrogel-based bioinks. However, the cell viability in such CPs is low due to shear forces applied on the cells in the bioink, inducing cellular apoptosis. Herein, we investigated whether the incorporation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the bioink, engineered to continually deliver the cell survival factor miR-199a-3p would increase the viability within the CP. EVs from THP-1-derived activated macrophages (M\u03a6) were isolated and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and Western blot analysis. MiR-199a-3p mimic was loaded into EVs by electroporation after optimization of applied voltage and pulses. Functionality of the engineered EVs was assessed in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (NRCM) monolayers using immunostaining for the proliferation markers ki67 and Aurora B kinase. To examine the effect of engineered EVs on 3D-bioprinted CP viability, the EVs were added to the bioink, consisting of alginate-RGD, gelatin, and NRCM. Metabolic activity and expression levels of activated-caspase 3 for apoptosis of the 3D-bioprinted CP were evaluated after 5 days. Electroporation (850 V with 5 pulses) was found to be optimal for miR loading; miR-199a-3p levels in EVs increased fivefold compared to simple incubation, with a loading efficiency of 21.0%. EV size and integrity were maintained under these conditions. Cellular uptake of engineered EVs by NRCM was validated, as 58% of cTnT", "journal": "International journal of bioprinting", "date": "2023-04-18", "authors": ["AssafBar", "OlgaKryukov", "SharonEtzion", "SmadarCohen"], "doi": "10.18063/ijb.v9i2.670"}

Although multiple cardiomyopathy-related mutations have been reported to reside on the two LIM domains and the disordered regions connecting the domains in this protein, the exact role of the disordered linker region is not clear. The linker harbors a few post-translational modification sites and is expected to be a regulatory site. We have carried out evolutionary studies on 5614 homologs spanning across taxa. We also performed molecular dynamics simulations of full-length CSRP3 to show that the length variations and conformational flexibility of the disordered linker could provide additional levels of functional modulation. Finally, we show that the CSRP3 homologs with widely different lengths of the linker regions could display diversity in their functional specifications.

{"title": "iNOS expressing macrophages co-localize with nitrotyrosine staining after myocardial infarction in humans.", "abstract": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) produces micromolar amounts of nitric oxide (NO) upon the right stimuli, whose further reactions can lead to oxidative stress. In murine models of myocardial infarction (MI), iNOS is known to be expressed in infiltrating macrophages, which at early onset enter the infarcted zone and are associated with inflammation. In contrast cardiac tissue resident macrophages are thought to enhance regeneration of tissue injury and re-establish homeostasis. Both detrimental and beneficial effects of iNOS have been described, still the role of iNOS in MI is not fully understood. Our aim was to examine cell expression patterns of iNOS and nitrotyrosine (NT) production in human MI.\nWe examined in postmortem human MI hearts the iNOS mRNA expression by means of qPCR. Further we performed immunohistochemical stainings for cell type identification. Afterwards a distance analysis between iNOS and NT was carried out to determine causality between iNOS and NT production.\niNOS mRNA expression was significantly increased in infarcted regions of human MI hearts and iNOS protein expression was detected in resident macrophages in infarcted human hearts as well as in controls hearts, being higher in resident macrophages in MI hearts compared to control. Furthermore in MI and in healthy human hearts cells showing signs of NT production peaked within 10-15\u2005\u00b5m proximity of iNOS+ cells.\nThese results indicate that, unexpectedly, resident macrophages are the main source of iNOS expression in postmortem human MI hearts. The peak of NT positive cells within 10-15\u2005\u00b5m of iNOS+ cells suggest an iNOS dependent level of NT and therefore iNOS dependent oxidative stress.

{"title": "Doxorubicin downregulates autophagy to promote apoptosis-induced dilated cardiomyopathy via regulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway.", "abstract": "The broad-spectrum antineoplastic drug doxorubicin (DOX) has one of the most serious chronic side effects on the heart, dilated cardiomyopathy, but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression subsequent to long latency periods remain puzzling. Here, we established a model of DOX-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. In a cardiac cytology exploration, we found that differentially expressed genes in the KEGG signaling pathway enrichment provided a novel complex network of mTOR bridging autophagy and oxidative stress. Validation results showed that DOX caused intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation in cardiomyocytes, disrupted mitochondria, led to imbalanced intracellular energy metabolism, and triggered cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Apoptosis showed a negative correlation with DOX-regulated cardiomyocyte autophagy. To evaluate whether the inhibition of mTOR could upregulate autophagy to protect cardiomyocytes, we used rapamycin to restore autophagy depressed by DOX. Rapamycin increased cardiomyocyte survival by easing the autophagic flux blocked by DOX. In addition, rapamycin reduced oxidative stress, prevented mitochondrial damage, and restored energy metabolic homeostasis in DOX-treated cardiomyocytes. In vivo, we used metformin (Met) which is an AMPK activator to protect cardiac tissue to alleviate DOX-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, Met significantly attenuated the oxidative stress response of myocardial tissue caused by DOX and activated cardiomyocyte autophagy to maintain cardiomyocyte energy metabolism and reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis by downregulating mTOR activity. Overall, our study revealed the role of autophagy and apoptosis in DOX-induced dilated cardiomyopathy and demonstrated the potential role of regulation of the AMPK/mTOR axis in the treatment of DOX-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2023-04-16", "authors": ["ShengZhang", "XuepingWei", "HaijinZhang", "YoupingWu", "JunsongJing", "RongrongHuang", "TingZhou", "JingjinHu", "YueguoWu", "YuanyuanLi", "ZhenqiangYou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114691"}
{"title": "Elevated bile acids are associated with left ventricular structural changes in biliary atresia.", "abstract": "In children with biliary atresia (BA), pathologic structural changes within the heart, which define cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, are associated with adverse perioperative outcomes. Despite their clinical relevance, little is known about the pathogenesis and triggers of pathologic remodeling. Bile acid excess causes cardiomyopathy in experimental cirrhosis, but its role in BA is poorly understood.\nEchocardiographic parameters of left ventricular (LV) geometry [LV mass (LVM), LVM indexed to height, left atrial volume indexed to BSA (LAVI), and LV internal diameter (LVID)] were correlated with circulating serum bile acid concentrations in 40 children (52% female) with BA listed for transplantation. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was generated to determine optimal threshold values of bile acids to detect pathologic changes in LV geometry using Youden index. Paraffin-embedded human heart tissue was separately analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of bile acid-sensing Takeda G-protein-coupled membrane receptor type 5.\nIn the cohort, 52% (21/40) of children had abnormal LV geometry; the optimal bile acid concentration to detect this abnormality with 70% sensitivity and 64% specificity was 152\u00a0\u00b5mol/L (C-statistics=0.68). Children with bile acid concentrations >152\u00a0\u00b5mol/L had \u223c8-fold increased odds of detecting abnormalities in LVM, LVM index, left atrial volume index, and LV internal diameter. Serum bile acids positively correlated with LVM, LVM index, and LV internal diameter. Separately, Takeda G-protein-coupled membrane receptor type 5 protein was detected in myocardial vasculature and cardiomyocytes on immunohistochemistry.\nThis association highlights the unique role of bile acids as one of the targetable potential triggers for myocardial structural changes in BA.", "journal": "Hepatology communications", "date": "2023-04-15", "authors": ["Manpreet KVirk", "Muhammad Umair MMian", "Dalia ABashir", "John KWilkes", "TobiasSchlingman", "SaulFlores", "CurtisKennedy", "FongLam", "Ayse AArikan", "TrungNguyen", "KrupaMysore", "Nhu Thao NguyenGalvan", "JorgeCoss-Bu", "Saul JKarpen", "SanjivHarpavat", "Moreshwar SDesai"], "doi": "10.1097/HC9.0000000000000109\n10.1002/hep4.1890"}

{"title": "Dectin-1 deficiency alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy by attenuating macrophage-mediated inflammatory response.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of mortality in patients with diabetes and obesity. Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetes alters cardiac function, which is associated with broader cellular processes such as aberrant inflammatory signaling. Recent studies have shown that a pattern recognition receptor called Dectin-1, expressed on macrophages, mediates pro-inflammatory responses in innate immunity. In the present study, we examined the role of Dectin-1 in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. We observed increased Dectin-1 expression in heart tissues of diabetic mice and localized the source to macrophages. We then investigated the cardiac function in Dectin-1-deficient mice with STZ-induced type 1 diabetes and high-fat-diet-induced type 2 diabetes. Our results show that Dectin-1 deficient mice are protected against diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, tissue fibrosis, and inflammation. Mechanistically, our studies show that Dectin-1 is important for cell activation and induction of inflammatory cytokines in high-concentration glucose and palmitate acid (HG\u00a0+\u00a0PA)-challenged macrophages. Deficiency of Dectin-1 generate fewer paracrine inflammatory factors capable of causing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrotic responses in cardiac fibroblasts. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that Dectin-1 mediates diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy through regulating inflammation.

{"title": "Metabolic Syndrome and Cardiac Remodeling Due to Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress Involving Gliflozins and Sirtuins.", "abstract": "To address the mechanistic pathways focusing on mitochondria dysfunction, oxidative stress, sirtuins imbalance, and other contributors in patient with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Sodium glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors deeply influence these mechanisms. Recent randomized clinical trials have shown impressive results in improving cardiac function and reducing cardiovascular and renal events. These unexpected results generate the need to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms able to generate these effects to help explain such significant clinical outcomes.\nCardiovascular disease is highly prevalent among individuals with metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is a principal player in its development and persistence, including the consequent cardiac remodeling and events. Another central protagonist is the renin-angiotensin system; the high angiotensin II (Ang II) activity fuel oxidative stress and local inflammatory responses. Additionally, sirtuins decline plays a pivotal role in the process; they enhance oxidative stress by regulating adaptive responses to the cellular environment and interacting with Ang II in many circumstances, including cardiac and vascular remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. Fasting and lower mitochondrial energy generation are conditions that substantially reduce most of the mentioned cardiometabolic syndrome disarrangements. In addition, it increases sirtuins levels, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b2 (HIF-1 beta) and favors ketosis. All these effects favor autophagy and mitophagy, clean the cardiac cells with damaged organelles, and reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory response, giving cardiac tissue protection. In this sense, SGLT-2 inhibitors enhance the level of at least four sirtuins, some located in the mitochondria. Moreover, late evidence shows that SLGT-2 inhibitors mimic this protective process, improving mitochondria function, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Considering the previously described protection at the cardiovascular level is necessary to go deeper in the knowledge of the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the mitochondria function. Various of the protective effects these drugs clearly had shown in the trials, and we briefly describe it could depend on sirtuins enhance activity, oxidative stress reduction, inflammatory process attenuation, less interstitial fibrosis, and a consequent better cardiac function. This information could encourage investigating new therapeutic strategies for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart and renal failure, and other diseases.", "journal": "Current hypertension reports", "date": "2023-04-14", "authors": ["Ra\u00fal LelioSanz", "FelipeInserra", "Sebasti\u00e1nGarc\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez", "LucianaMazzei", "Le\u00f3nFerder", "WalterManucha"], "doi": "10.1007/s11906-023-01240-w\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950\n10.1038/nrd.2018.174\n10.1152/ajpendo.00057.2018\n10.2174/1381612811319270003\n10.1007/s11906-006-0050-7\n10.1016/j.mcna.2016.08.009\n10.1007/s11906-012-0305-4\n10.1089/ars.2017.7290\n10.1038/nrm3293\n10.1073/pnas.1101507108\n10.1152/ajpheart.01176.2008\n10.1159/000107757\n10.5493/wjem.v4.i4.46\n10.18632/aging.100544\n10.1111/obr.12229\n10.1016/j.mam.2011.10.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00053.2015\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165801\n10.3109/10715762.2014.920956\n10.1073/pnas.0803790105\n10.1089/ars.2017.7178\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223545\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311448\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00012\n10.1186/s12933-017-0615-6\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.011\n10.1161/hy1101.092845\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.07.019\n10.1016/j.redox.2014.01.012\n10.1172/JCI120849\n10.1186/s12933-020-01041-4\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117761\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.048\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.026\n10.1136/heartjnl-2013-304657\n10.1007/BF02001410\n10.1113/JP271301\n10.1016/j.tem.2015.06.001\n10.7150/thno.45922\n10.18433/J3NW2K\n10.1093/cvr/cvq285\n10.1073/pnas.1111308108\n10.1007/s00395-015-0493-6\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000485\n10.1056/NEJMoa1504720\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029190\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.03.009\n10.1093/ehjcvp/pvac029\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.052186\n10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02074-8\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042375\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.11.010\n10.1093/ajh/hpz016\n10.2337/dc16-1312\n10.1016/j.cjca.2019.08.033\n10.1186/s12933-019-0849-6\n10.1007/s00125-019-4859-4\n10.21037/atm.2019.09.03\n10.1186/s12933-019-0816-2\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.02.004\n10.1186/s12933-022-01532-6\n10.1007/s10557-017-6725-2\n10.1016/j.vph.2018.06.006\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112515\n10.2337/dc16-0330\n10.1172/jci.insight.124079\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2018.07.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0263285\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19586\n10.2169/internalmedicine.0701-17\n10.1007/s13300-022-01280-6\n10.2337/dc19-1177\n10.1016/j.jash.2014.02.003\n10.1186/s12933-019-0839-8\n10.2337/dc14-1596\n10.1186/s12933-017-0621-8\n10.3390/biology9110369\n10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101337\n10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.028\n10.1016/j.molcel.2012.10.024\n10.4093/dmj.2014.38.5.321\n10.1038/embor.2011.151\n10.1016/j.mce.2015.05.028\n10.1038/nature07813\n10.1080/21623945.2020.1807850\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227371\n10.1089/ars.2013.5359\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036259\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050498\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.02.025\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.120.007197\n10.1042/CS20190863\n10.1007/s12551-020-00742-0\n10.1007/s00395-019-0733-2\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2016.04.005\n10.1038/nm.3804\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318241\n10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.04.016\n10.1074/jbc.M111.244780\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044235\n10.2337/dc17-1096\n10.2337/dc18-1959\n10.1002/jcp.26337\n10.1111/jcmm.14757\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000719\n10.1038/s41569-020-00480-6\n10.3390/biology9110369\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01347\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab197\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.172810\n10.1038/s41591-022-01703-8\n10.1038/nm.2961\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.626929\n10.1007/s00395-011-0161-4\n10.1093/cvr/cvab129\n10.3390/ijms22157976\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104781\n10.1152/ajplung.00167.2015\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.052503\n10.1016/j.jchf.2021.05.006\n10.1038/s41569-018-0097-6\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01370.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0099495\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000967\n10.1291/hypres.31.1069\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.11.194\n10.1016/S0735-1097(22)02535-9\n10.2147/DMSO.S58786"}

Target-based drug therapy is much needed for the management of heart failure. We have designed this study to evaluate icariin for its cardioprotective activity in the isoproterenol (ISO) induced postinfarction model. We have randomly distributed Wistar rats into seven groups, i.e., vehicle control; isoproterenol-treated; icariin per se; sildenafil per se; ISO + icariin 5; ISO + icariin 10; and ISO + sildenafil groups. ISO (85 mg/kg, subcutaneous) was administered at 24 hr for two consecutive days to produce cardiac injury, followed by icariin administration at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg orally for 56 days.\nRats were subjected to hemodynamic measurements biweekly. After 24 hr of the completion of dosing, animals were sacrificed, and markers for oxidative stress, fibrosis, inflammation, and cell death were measured. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), histopathology, and MT staining of cardiac tissue were also done to assess the pathological and fibrotic architectural damage.\nA significant decline in hemodynamics and an anti-oxidant collapse were found in ISO-intoxicated rats. Alterations in the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), interleukin-10 (IL-10), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were also observed in serum. Up-regulation of caspase-3, nuclear factor (NF-\u0138B), and decline in expression of nuclear factor (NrF-2) contribute to cardiac damage.

{"title": "A Study of R-R Interval Transition Matrix Features for Machine Learning Algorithms in AFib Detection.", "abstract": "Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is a heart condition that occurs when electrophysiological malformations within heart tissues cause the atria to lose coordination with the ventricles, resulting in \"irregularly irregular\" heartbeats. Because symptoms are subtle and unpredictable, AFib diagnosis is often difficult or delayed. One possible solution is to build a system which predicts AFib based on the variability of R-R intervals (the distances between two R-peaks). This research aims to incorporate the transition matrix as a novel measure of R-R variability, while combining three segmentation schemes and two feature importance measures to systematically analyze the significance of individual features. The MIT-BIH dataset was first divided into three segmentation schemes, consisting of 5-s, 10-s, and 25-s subsets. In total, 21 various features, including the transition matrix features, were extracted from these subsets and used for the training of 11 machine learning classifiers. Next, permutation importance and tree-based feature importance calculations determined the most predictive features for each model. In summary, with Leave-One-Person-Out Cross Validation, classifiers under the 25-s segmentation scheme produced the best accuracies; specifically, Gradient Boosting (96.08%), Light Gradient Boosting (96.11%), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (96.30%). Among eleven classifiers, the three gradient boosting models and Random Forest exhibited the highest overall performance across all segmentation schemes.

{"title": "Preclinical Large Animal Porcine Models for Cardiac Regeneration and Its Clinical Translation: Role of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Myocardial Infarction (MI) occurs due to a blockage in the coronary artery resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiomyocytes in the left ventricular heart muscle. The dying cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrous scar tissue, causing a decrease in myocardial contractility and thus affecting the functional capacity of the myocardium. Treatments, such as stent placements, cardiac bypasses, or transplants are beneficial but with many limitations, and may decrease the overall life expectancy due to related complications. In recent years, with the advent of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), newer avenues using cell-based approaches for the treatment of MI have emerged as a potential for cardiac regeneration. While hiPSCs and their derived differentiated cells are promising candidates, their translatability for clinical applications has been hindered due to poor preclinical reproducibility. Various preclinical animal models for MI, ranging from mice to non-human primates, have been adopted in cardiovascular research to mimic MI in humans. Therefore, a comprehensive literature review was essential to elucidate the factors affecting the reproducibility and translatability of large animal models. In this review article, we have discussed different animal models available for studying stem-cell transplantation in cardiovascular applications, mainly focusing on the highly translatable porcine MI model.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2023-04-14", "authors": ["DivyaSridharan", "NooruddinPracha", "Schaza JavedRana", "SalmmanAhmed", "Anam JDewani", "Syed BaseeruddinAlvi", "MuhamadMergaye", "UzairAhmed", "MahmoodKhan"], "doi": "10.3390/cells12071090\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.03.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315268\n10.1179/2295333714Y.0000000069\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.750510\n10.1038/s41569-020-0403-y\n10.1038/s41569-021-00506-7\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01342\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60107-0\n10.1517/14656566.1.6.1105\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.11.053\n10.1067/mtc.2001.112831\n10.3390/ijms20061420\n10.3390/ijms22179206\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.315855\n10.1186/scrt381\n10.1161/hh1301.093953\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000183524.73746.1b\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.086074\n10.1002/14651858.CD006536.pub3\n10.2217/rme.10.65\n10.1038/nm0898-929\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.11.009\n10.1186/s13287-020-1582-5\n10.1007/s10517-006-0403-x\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.03.066\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.08.092\n10.1186/s13287-020-01648-0\n10.1016/j.gendis.2014.07.003\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1530/REP-18-0291\n10.14348/molcells.2019.2439\n10.1038/s41536-020-00100-4\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.09.014\n10.1038/s41536-021-00140-4\n10.1038/s42003-021-02237-4\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.06.005\n10.1186/s13287-020-01811-7\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030785\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aay1318\n10.1038/s41598-017-08869-z\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000366\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.084343\n10.1186/s13287-019-1183-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047904\n10.7150/thno.56757\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.3390/ani10091561\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305462\n10.1186/s13287-020-02109-4\n10.1186/s13036-019-0204-1\n10.1007/s40259-021-00503-9\n10.4137/BMI.S20050\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1016/j.xpro.2022.101560\n10.7150/thno.19427\n10.1093/ehjci/ehaa946.3655\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.076\n10.1007/s00395-021-00875-7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310820\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.526749\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.09.010\n10.3390/biomedicines9121836\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.10.007\n10.1155/2011/497841\n10.1093/cvr/cvz161\n10.1152/ajpheart.00922.2008\n10.1242/dmm.046565\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.11.026\n10.7555/JBR.31.20160020\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.237693\n10.1186/s12944-016-0402-5\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.673683\n10.3390/jcdd3040030\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1002626\n10.3389/fcvm.2019.00117\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.320246\n10.1186/s12967-018-1678-1\n10.1001/jama.2022.15434\n10.1093/cvr/21.10.737\n10.1177/0300985811402846\n10.1152/ajpheart.00797.2013\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.011\n10.1155/2014/571076\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.07.008\n10.1007/s12013-014-0369-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0066688\n10.1006/jsre.1996.0340\n10.3389/fonc.2018.00559\n10.1152/ajpheart.00373.2022\n10.1038/cmi.2016.39\n10.1016/j.healun.2006.02.003\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.01.039\n10.1186/s41232-020-00125-8\n10.3390/cells10092319"}
{"title": "Novel Transcriptomic Interactomes of Noncoding RNAs in the Heart under Altered Thyroid Hormonal States.", "abstract": "Noncoding RNAs are emerging as vital players in cardiovascular diseases. Thyroid hormones (THs) are crucial for cardiovascular survival; however, correction of systemic hypothyroidism (low serum THs) may not improve cardiac tissue-level hypothyroidism or cardiac function. Mechanistically, the understanding of noncoding transcriptomic interactions influencing TH-mediated cardiac effects is unclear. Adult C57BL/6J mixed-sex mice were randomized into Control, Hypothyroid (HypoTH), Hyperthyroid (HyperTH), and HypoTH-Triiodothyronine restoration groups. Physiological, morphological, biochemical, molecular, and whole transcriptomic studies and appropriate statistical analyses were performed. HypoTH showed significant atrophy, depressed cardiac function, and decreased serum THs versus controls, and Triiodothyronine supplementation restored them. HyperTH significantly increased serum THs with hypertrophy. Real-time PCR showed significantly altered inflammatory and immune lncRNAs. The transcriptomic sequencing revealed significant differential expressions of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Eleven novel circRNAs significantly decreased with increased THs. Multiple pathways were GO-/KEGG-enriched, including cardiac, thyroid, cancer, mitochondrial, inflammatory, adrenergic, metabolic, immune-mediated, vesicular, etc. We also uncovered significant novel co-expression and interactions of lncRNA-miRNA, lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA, lncRNA-mRNA, circRNA-miRNA, and miRNA-mRNA, and splicing events. This includes a novel pathway by which the predominant cardiac TH receptor alpha may interact with specific lncRNAs and miRNAs. This is the first study reporting a comprehensive transcriptome-wide interactome in the cardiac-thyroid axis.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-04-14", "authors": ["ViswanathanRajagopalan", "SankalpaChakraborty", "RichardLin"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24076560\n10.1186/s13059-020-1931-9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311802\n10.12688/f1000research.15797.1\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa195\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.007548\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2022.02.003\n10.1093/nar/gkaa1046\n10.3390/ijms21031027\n10.1186/s13059-017-1348-2\n10.1038/ncomms7779\n10.1093/cvr/cvz227\n10.1038/s41569-019-0185-2\n10.1261/rna.064394.117\n10.3390/cells9071616\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3001229\n10.1124/mol.111.073528\n10.1002/stem.2121\n10.1126/science.1139089\n10.1093/cvr/cvs013\n10.3389/fgene.2019.00778\n10.1080/15476286.2015.1112487\n10.1126/science.1149460\n10.1016/j.arr.2022.101610\n10.1186/s13287-019-1451-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000048124.64204.3F\n10.1089/thy.2017.0414\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.05.042\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.984952\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2019.01.007\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.000502\n10.1007/s11897-014-0246-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.917922\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.010\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.174\n10.1016/j.mce.2020.110972\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151413\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00225\n10.2119/molmed.2013.00040\n10.1089/thy.2017.0544\n10.1016/j.echo.2020.05.009\n10.1210/jc.2007-2210\n10.1152/ajpheart.01379.2007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00105.2021\n10.1186/s13058-020-01337-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0269893\n10.1096/fj.202200574R\n10.3389/fendo.2014.00171\n10.3390/ijms23126549\n10.1186/s13578-017-0141-y\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110657\n10.3390/ijms222212303\n10.1016/bs.mcb.2021.06.002\n10.1186/s12920-019-0570-z\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00669\n10.3389/fphys.2022.777284\n10.1038/s41569-022-00804-8\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.115.001264\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.002\n10.1080/15476286.2021.1894025\n10.3390/biomedicines10123076\n10.18632/aging.202385\n10.1159/000443523\n10.1371/journal.pone.0190987\n10.1210/en.2012-2087\n10.3390/cells9102155\n10.1161/JAHA.117.008261\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00729\n10.1038/s41467-020-20670-7\n10.1016/j.ceca.2020.102288\n10.1152/physrev.00030.2013\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000680\n10.1089/thy.2008.0043\n10.1152/ajpregu.00591.2011\n10.21037/atm.2018.06.12\n10.15420/cfr.2017:3:2\n10.1080/08998280.2020.1786227\n10.1186/1471-2407-13-334\n10.1016/j.xjtc.2022.08.030\n10.1186/s13293-016-0089-3\n10.1007/s12020-016-1020-8\n10.1038/nprot.2016.095\n10.1038/nbt.3122\n10.1038/nbt.1621\n10.1073/pnas.1419161111\n10.1093/nar/gkt646\n10.1093/nar/gkm391\n10.1093/nar/30.1.276\n10.1186/gb-2010-11-2-r14\n10.1093/nar/28.1.27\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bti430\n10.1093/bib/bbx014\n10.1038/nature11928\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1186/gb-2009-10-3-r25\n10.1093/nar/gkr688\n10.1186/1471-2105-13-140\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015224\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp612\n10.1214/aos/1074290335\n10.1186/gb-2004-5-4-105\n10.1186/s12862-015-0534-7"}
{"title": "Importance of Mitochondria in Cardiac Pathologies: Focus on Uncoupling Proteins and Monoamine Oxidases.", "abstract": "On the one hand, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the onset and progression of a wide array of diseases. On the other hand, these are a part of signaling pathways related to cell metabolism, growth and survival. While ROS are produced at various cellular sites, in cardiomyocytes the largest amount of ROS is generated by mitochondria. Apart from the electron transport chain and various other proteins, uncoupling protein (UCP) and monoamine oxidases (MAO) have been proposed to modify mitochondrial ROS formation. Here, we review the recent information on UCP and MAO in cardiac injuries induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) as well as protection from I/R and heart failure secondary to I/R injury or pressure overload. The current data in the literature suggest that I/R will preferentially upregulate UCP2 in cardiac tissue but not UCP3. Studies addressing the consequences of such induction are currently inconclusive because the precise function of UCP2 in cardiac tissue is not well understood, and tissue- and species-specific aspects complicate the situation. In general, UCP2 may reduce oxidative stress by mild uncoupling and both UCP2 and UCP3 affect substrate utilization in cardiac tissue, thereby modifying post-ischemic remodeling. MAOs are important for the physiological regulation of substrate concentrations.

There are many mechanisms of radiation treatment exposure to toxicities. Our aim was to summarize the literature about known mechanisms of radiation-induced cardiac toxicities. We performed a systematic review of the literature on the PubMed database until October 2022 about cardiovascular toxicities and radiation therapy exposure. Only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and reviews were selected. Out of 1429 publications screened, 43 papers met inclusion criteria and were selected for the umbrella review process. Microvascular and macrovascular complications could lead to adverse cardiac effects. Many radiotherapy-associated risk factors were responsible, such as the site of radiation treatment, beam proximity to heart tissues, total dosage, the number of radiotherapy sessions, adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents used, and patient traditional cardiovascular risk factors, patient age, and gender. Moreover, important dosage cutoff values could increase the incidence of cardiac toxicities. Finally, the time from radiation exposure to cardiac side effects was assessed. Our report highlighted mechanisms, radiation dosage values, and the timeline of cardiovascular toxicities after radiation therapy. All of the above may be used for the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and the development of screening programs for cancer patients.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-04-14", "authors": ["Konstantinos CSiaravas", "Christos SKatsouras", "ChrissaSioka"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24076272\n10.1055/s-0041-1729885\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.07.005\n10.1007/s11912-022-01238-8\n10.1080/09553002.2021.1956007\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.887705\n10.1186/1748-717X-6-151\n10.1080/14656566.2018.1446080\n10.1155/2020/3579143\n10.3390/ijms231810617\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.946137\n10.1016/j.repc.2021.04.011\n10.1007/s11864-021-00868-7\n10.1016/j.radonc.2022.04.030\n10.3390/cancers13071712\n10.1097/HCO.0000000000000404\n10.1002/pbc.20346\n10.3390/ijms23010441\n10.1016/j.jtho.2020.11.002\n10.1161/JAHA.120.020243\n10.1159/000510573\n10.1161/JAHA.121.021686\n10.1007/s11886-020-01380-4\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2018.04.028\n10.1016/j.canrad.2020.07.001\n10.1007/s11936-018-0627-x\n10.1007/s11886-021-01446-x\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2021.06.007\n10.1007/s11864-021-00869-6\n10.2478/raon-2018-0035\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.01.090\n10.7150/ijbs.35460\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.665303\n10.1016/j.ahj.2017.08.015\n10.14797/mdcj-15-4-274\n10.3390/cancers12020415\n10.1016/j.acvd.2016.10.003\n10.1161/JAHA.119.014668\n10.1097/MD.0000000000016507\n10.21873/anticanres.13272\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00041"}

{"title": "Cardiac RGS Proteins in Human Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation: Focus on RGS4.", "abstract": "The regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are crucial for the termination of G protein signals elicited by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This superfamily of cell membrane receptors, by far the largest and most versatile in mammals, including humans, play pivotal roles in the regulation of cardiac function and homeostasis. Perturbations in both the activation and termination of their G protein-mediated signaling underlie numerous heart pathologies, including heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). Therefore, RGS proteins play important roles in the pathophysiology of these two devasting cardiac diseases, and several of them could be targeted therapeutically. Although close to 40 human RGS proteins have been identified, each RGS protein seems to interact only with a specific set of G protein subunits and GPCR types/subtypes in any given tissue or cell type. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies in animal models, and also in diseased human heart tissue obtained from transplantations or tissue banks, have provided substantial evidence of the roles various cardiomyocyte RGS proteins play in cardiac normal homeostasis as well as pathophysiology. One RGS protein in particular, RGS4, has been reported in what are now decades-old studies to be selectively upregulated in human HF. It has also been implicated in protection against AFib via knockout mice studies. This review summarizes the current understanding of the functional roles of cardiac RGS proteins and their implications for the treatment of HF and AFib, with a specific focus on RGS4 for the aforementioned reasons but also because it can be targeted successfully with small organic molecule inhibitors.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-04-14", "authors": ["Jordana IBorges", "Malka SSuster", "AnastasiosLymperopoulos"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24076136\n10.1016/j.tips.2019.04.001\n10.1124/mol.117.111062\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01452\n10.1038/nrd.2017.178\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-033910\n10.1038/nature11896\n10.1074/jbc.R109.051847\n10.1038/nature10361\n10.1038/nature10488\n10.1126/science.aaa5264\n10.1007/BF00928361\n10.1002/bip.22836\n10.1016/j.molcel.2021.02.002\n10.1038/nature18324\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)43512-5\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90165-9\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)39988-0\n10.1167/iovs.13-13281\n10.1016/S0960-9822(98)70196-4\n10.1128/MCB.15.7.3635\n10.1128/MCB.16.9.5194\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80998-8\n10.1161/01.RES.0000158287.49872.4e\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-18-07178.1998\n10.1016/S0955-0674(97)80055-5\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80204-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.231423\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00037.2018\n10.1124/pr.117.015354\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.09.005\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.795\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.052\n10.1074/jbc.M203802200\n10.1210/endo.138.2.5034\n10.1074/jbc.M111.332130\n10.1074/jbc.REV119.007060\n10.1111/j.0953-816X.2004.03364.x\n10.18388/abp.2005_3412\n10.1182/blood.V97.10.3051\n10.1074/jbc.M005947200\n10.1042/bj20021769\n10.1002/jcb.24741\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0591\n10.1053/euhj.2000.2578\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.180984\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00095\n10.1172/JCI35620\n10.1007/s00395-010-0098-z\n10.1074/jbc.M210663200\n10.1038/35059104\n10.1073/pnas.1008397107\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.002\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.10.1130\n10.1159/000080338\n10.1152/ajpheart.00026.2011\n10.1074/jbc.M200751200\n10.1016/j.molcel.2008.06.024\n10.1016/S0014-5793(98)01319-2\n10.1007/s00210-003-0798-0\n10.1038/ncb1065\n10.1007/s11897-014-0247-z\n10.1007/s00210-007-0214-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.3.441\n10.1172/JCI6713\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1307\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.22.2210\n10.1161/01.RES.87.12.1172\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00459-5\n10.3390/ijms23105803\n10.1152/physrev.00041.2018\n10.3390/ijms23063303\n10.1073/pnas.1016088108\n10.3390/ijms22147684\n10.1152/ajplung.00306.2018\n10.1038/s41598-018-28048-y\n10.3390/cells10113249\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00204\n10.3390/biomedicines9081008\n10.1007/s10741-008-9132-8\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.19.2565\n10.1016/0922-4106(89)90051-5\n10.1172/JCI113569\n10.1006/jmcc.1994.1017\n10.1161/01.CIR.82.4.1249\n10.1161/01.CIR.75.2.331\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.05.057\n10.1007/s00424-014-1515-1\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.70.113006.100455\n10.1152/ajpcell.00027.2010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.300561\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.158774\n10.1093/eurheartj/11.suppl_C.35\n10.1016/j.hfc.2007.10.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.803999\n10.1038/nm1553\n10.1124/pr.54.3.527\n10.1111/febs.15771\n10.1038/s41467-020-19304-9\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2021.07.007\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.05.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.224212\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.224220\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.183384\n10.1074/jbc.M113.520742\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.01.091\n10.1113/jphysiol.2007.148346\n10.1074/jbc.M115.666719\n10.1016/j.jacc.2022.03.379\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035202\n10.1016/j.tips.2018.07.002\n10.3390/cimb44120415\n10.1093/function/zqac055\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02930.x\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3564\n10.7314/APJCP.2012.13.4.1097\n10.1165/rcmb.2017-0109OC"}
{"title": "Anthracycline Therapy Modifies Immune Checkpoint Signaling in the Heart.", "abstract": "Cancer survival rates have increased significantly because of improvements in therapy regimes and novel immunomodulatory drugs. Recently, combination therapies of anthracyclines and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been proposed to maximize neoplastic cell removal. However, it has been speculated that a priori anthracycline exposure may prone the heart vulnerable to increased toxicity from subsequent ICI therapy, such as an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) inhibitor. Here, we used a high-dose anthracycline mouse model to characterize the role of the PD1 immune checkpoint signaling pathway in cardiac tissue using flow cytometry and immunostaining. Anthracycline treatment led to decreased heart function, increased concentration of markers of cell death after six days and a change in heart cell population composition with fewer cardiomyocytes. At the same time point, the number of PD1 ligand (PDL1)-positive immune cells and endothelial cells in the heart decreased significantly. The results suggest that PD1/PDL1 signaling is affected after anthracycline treatment, which may contribute to an increased susceptibility to immune-related adverse events of subsequent anti-PD1/PDL1 cancer therapy.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-04-14", "authors": ["SebastianKorste", "StephanSettelmeier", "LarsMichel", "AndreaOdersky", "PiaStock", "FabriceReyes", "EliasHaj-Yehia", "Markus SAnker", "AnikaGr\u00fcneboom", "Ulrike BHendgen-Cotta", "TienushRassaf", "MatthiasTotzeck"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24076052\n10.3322/caac.21590\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30164-1\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.65\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00026\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013777\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.03.095\n10.3389/fphar.2022.811406\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.06.007\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.11.106\n10.1200/JCO.2018.36.15_suppl.104\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.3689\n10.1093/annonc/mdz095.034\n10.1111/bjh.17849\n10.1038/nrc3239\n10.1038/nature10673\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2019.100420\n10.1126/science.aar4060\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.3923\n10.1007/s00059-020-04954-8\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab430\n10.1056/NEJM200103153441101\n10.1007/s10549-022-06547-x\n10.1056/NEJMoa1910549\n10.1056/NEJMoa1809615\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32531-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31953-X\n10.1073/pnas.1718197115\n10.3390/cells11061042\n10.7150/thno.69119\n10.1021/acsami.1c21775\n10.1016/j.bcp.2021.114410\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103456\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154027\n10.1093/cvr/cvac026\n10.1177/0192623313482056\n10.1007/s005800170008\n10.1038/s41418-019-0372-z\n10.1096/fj.201802663R\n10.1038/s41419-021-03614-x\n10.1186/s40959-019-0037-6\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01774\n10.1371/journal.pone.0124059\n10.3906/biy-1909-12\n10.1016/j.jss.2008.05.002\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa110\n10.3791/62019\n10.1038/nmeth.2089"}

Here, we report a leaf-venation-directed strategy that enables the compaction and remodeling of cell-hydrogel hybrids into highly aligned and densely packed organizations in predetermined patterns. This strategy contributes to interconnected tubular structures with cell alignment along the hierarchical channels. Compared to randomly-distributed cells, the engineered leaf-venation-directed-cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes manifest advanced maturation and functionality as evidenced by detectable electrophysiological activity, macroscopically synchronous contractions, and upregulated maturation genes. As a demonstration, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived leaf-venation-directed-cardiac tissues are engineered with evident structural and functional improvement over time. With the elastic scaffolds, leaf-venation-directed tissues are assembled into 3D centimeter-scale cardiac constructs with programmed mechanical properties, which can be delivered through tubing without affecting cell viability. The present strategy may generate cardiac constructs with multifaceted functionalities to meet clinical demands.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2023-04-13", "authors": ["MaoMao", "XiaoliQu", "YaboZhang", "BingsongGu", "ChenLi", "RongzhiLiu", "XiaoLi", "HuiZhu", "JiankangHe", "DichenLi"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-023-37716-1\n10.1038/s41569-021-00603-7\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aad2304\n10.1038/s41551-022-00885-3\n10.1016/j.stem.2018.01.015\n10.1152/physrev.00025.2003\n10.1161/01.CIR.86.1.38\n10.1038/s42003-018-0202-8\n10.1126/sciadv.abb5067\n10.1038/nmat2316\n10.1002/adbi.202000190\n10.1126/sciadv.1500423\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310277\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.014\n10.1073/pnas.1615728114\n10.1073/pnas.0906504107\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.10.028\n10.1038/s41551-018-0271-5\n10.1016/j.scr.2016.04.014\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.089\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120195\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.045\n10.1002/advs.201900344\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.042\n10.18063/ijb.v7i3.362\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.011\n10.1002/adma.202200217\n10.1002/smll.202000546\n10.1038/nmat4444\n10.1073/pnas.1613058113\n10.1073/pnas.1217796110\n10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0258\n10.1038/s41596-021-00495-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.03.039\n10.1038/ncomms1302\n10.1038/nbt.2465\n10.1289/ehp.1205056\n10.1016/j.crphys.2022.01.005\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.3389/fcell.2022.850645\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00118.2011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120906\n10.1088/1758-5090/aba1fa\n10.1038/nmat4956\n10.1001/jama.2019.2617\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv189\n10.1007/s42242-022-00204-4\n10.1002/smll.202108102\n10.1016/j.tplants.2016.01.016\n10.1115/1.4026221\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.024\n10.1038/nprot.2008.183\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.757286\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.083\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.091\n10.1038/s41467-019-12748-8\n10.1038/s41551-021-00796-9\n10.1038/s41596-019-0189-8\n10.1126/sciadv.aay6994\n10.1038/s41551-022-00884-4\n10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0283\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.04.022\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.056\n10.1016/j.matbio.2016.08.003\n10.1002/jbm.a.35840"}

C17-SAMT exhibited common symptoms of toxicity in mice, including flaccid paralysis and severe respiratory distress, followed by rapid death. To determine the potential health risks of this neurotoxin, we assessed its subchronic toxicity according to the recommendations of OCDE n\u00b0 407.

Macroscopic observations showed that mice treated with 0.9, 9, and 90\u00a0\u00b5g/kg C17-SAMT had significantly reduced stomach weights, swollen and fragile intestines, and signs of nephritis with renal abscesses. Transaminase assays pointed out that exposure to C17-SAMT can lead to transaminitis. Above-average lactate dehydrogenase values were recorded in both the treated and satellite groups. Hematology data showed a significant reduction in red blood cell counts in high-dose-treated group. Reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit were also recorded. Mean leukocyte counts were significantly elevated in the high-, mid-dose treated and satellite groups. At the microscopic level, we noted myocardial atrophy and hyperemia. In the lungs, we noted necrosis associated with macrophages perivascular infiltration and congestion. The kidneys showed mild inflammation and glomerular atrophy. The stomach exhibited mucosal atrophy, while a thin colon and distended small intestine were observed in high-dose-treated group.

The FAIMS approach substantially reduces manual sample handling, significantly shortens the MS instrument processing time, and produces unique protein identification and quantification approximating the commonly used IN-Seq method in less time.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2023-04-12", "authors": ["LizhuoAi", "AleksandraBinek", "SimionKreimer", "MatthewAyres", "AleksandrStotland", "Jennifer EVan Eyk"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00027\n10.1021/ar0301330\n10.1161/hh0801.090193\n10.1161/01.RES.0000201280.20709.26\n10.1016/j.jprot.2013.05.004\n10.2174/157340310791162631\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00446\n10.1385/1-59745-214-9:15\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018497\n10.1038/sdata.2016.15\n10.1074/mcp.M110.004291\n10.1038/s41467-017-01747-2\n10.1016/j.ab.2005.07.001\n10.1016/S0021-9258(17)37948-6\n10.1016/S0898-6568(02)00061-X\n10.1016/j.jprot.2010.03.016\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226910\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.11.009\n10.1586/epr.12.50\n10.1007/s13361-015-1326-4\n10.1016/j.ijms.2009.05.009\n10.1016/j.ijms.2010.01.006\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02233\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05399\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00759\n10.1074/mcp.TIR118.000862\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00337\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03262\n10.1039/D0SC03636F\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00049\n10.1038/s41598-022-16358-1\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00695\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316311\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00685\n10.1093/cid/ciac295\n10.1038/nbt.2377\n10.1038/s41592-019-0638-x\n10.1002/rcm.1992\n10.1038/s41596-022-00710-w\n10.1021/jasms.0c00032\n10.1093/nar/gkab1038\n10.1074/mcp.TIR119.001906"}
{"title": "Cardiac amyloidosis: A survey of current awareness, diagnostic modalities, treatment practices, and clinical challenges among cardiologists in selected Middle Eastern countries.", "abstract": "Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a chronic progressive disease caused by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in cardiac tissues. Diagnosis and management of CA are complicated and have developed over the years.\nMiddle Eastern countries have significant knowledge disparities in diagnosing, managing, and treating different subtypes of CA.\nAn online survey was sent to cardiologists in four countries (Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, and Iraq) interested in heart failure and practicing for more than a year. The survey questioned the characteristics of the participants and their institutions. It addressed their knowledge and practices in CA specifically diagnostic modalities, treatment options, and interest in education and knowledge exchange.\nA total of 85 physicians participated in the survey. There was a variation in the participating cardiologists'\u00a0knowledge, experience level, and readiness of their institutes to manage patients with ATTR-CM. Most participants believed that a high rate of ATTR-CM misdiagnosis existed. Participants'\u00a0knowledge of the diagnostic modalities and \"red flags\"\u00a0raising suspicion about ATTR-CM varied. Another challenge was the availability of essential diagnostic modalities among various cardiology centers. A knowledge gap was also observed regarding updates in ATTR-CM management. However, there was a high endorsement of the need for more education, physician networking, and knowledge exchange.\nThis survey highlighted the need for increasing awareness levels among cardiologists in the four selected Middle Eastern countries. Cardiologists are most likely to benefit from additional training and knowledge exchange on the latest management advances of this disease. Thus, measures must be taken to focus on the physician's awareness of ATTR-CM patient journey to achieve a better quality of care and outcome.", "journal": "Clinical cardiology", "date": "2023-04-12", "authors": ["DaniaMohty", "SamerNasr", "HanyRagy", "Hasan AFarhan", "BahaaFadel", "IslamAlayary", "MarcelleGhoubar"], "doi": "10.1002/clc.23985\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038169\n10.1080/13506129.2018.1498782\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.12.063\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.08.045\n10.1007/s40119-019-00160-8\n10.1007/s10916-006-7399-7\n10.1007/s10741-015-9480-0\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx043\n10.1007/s00259-018-4013-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.021612\n10.3109/13506129.2013.825240\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.06.053\n10.1056/NEJMoa1805689"}

Element concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Significant differences in elemental concentrations between analyzed tissues were observed for Ag, Al, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, S, Se, and Zn. The concentrations of Ag, Fe, Mo, and S were significantly different between all analyzed tissues. Muscle tissue is characterised by higher concentrations of some macroelements (K, Mg, S) and liver tissue by higher concentrations of some trace elements (Fe, Mn, Mo, and Zn). Cardiac tissue could be the target organ for bioaccumulation of Ag and Se. The molar ratio Se:Hg was higher than 1 in all studied tissues. There were few significant differences between element concentrations in mongooses from three analyzed (Airport, Saline, Inland) groups. Significantly higher concentrations of Ag and Se were found in liver tissue of Inland mongooses compared to animals from Airport and Saline.

Danlou tablet (Dan) is a kind of Chinese patent medicine used in angina pectoris treatment in China. However, it remains unclear whether and how Dan could protect against cardiac remodeling after myocardial I/RI. In this study, both preventive and therapeutic administration of Dan attenuated ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction at 3\u00a0weeks after myocardial I/RI. Dan inhibited Bax/Bcl2 ratio and Caspase3 cleavage in heart tissues and also inhibited apoptosis of human AC16 cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes stressed by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion. Mechanistically, Dan inhibited myocardial apoptosis through phosphorylating AKT and FoxO3a, thereby inhibiting downstream BIM and PUMA expressions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Dan treatment is effective to protect against cardiac remodeling and dysfunction after myocardial I/RI and provide theoretical basis for its cardioprotection and clinical application in treating ischemic cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2023-04-11", "authors": ["LinLi", "WeitongQi", "YujiaoZhu", "MingmingYin", "ChenChen", "MengWei", "ZhenzhenHuang", "ZhuhuaSu", "JizongJiang", "MingxueZhang", "YihuaBei"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-023-10365-x\n10.1007/s00395-022-00970-3\n10.3892/etm.2016.3877\n10.1016/s0167-5273(98)00362-3\n10.1155/2022/9626703\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.11.045\n10.1016/s0022-2828(03)00135-4\n10.1111/jcmm.12827\n10.1007/s11655-015-2284-1\n10.1007/s11655-020-3255-8\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.858909\n10.1007/s11655-016-2448-7\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2022.01.031\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.02.014\n10.1186/s12916-019-1268-y\n10.1155/2019/7854389\n10.1155/2022/4463108\n10.1016/j.brainres.2007.12.059\n10.3389/fphar.2015.00169\n10.1016/j.jbior.2014.07.002\n10.1038/jcbfm.2009.102\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4402095\n10.1161/01.cir.101.6.660\n10.1074/jbc.M310405200\n10.1210/me.2008-0265\n10.1007/s00109-022-02219-x\n10.1002/jcp.26235\n10.1186/1465-9921-14-68\n10.1016/j.neulet.2015.10.001\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.06.006\n10.1016/j.tips.2022.09.010\n10.3892/ijo_00000291\n10.1038/aps.2013.91\n10.1089/ars.2018.7597"}

We performed finite element (FE) modeling and single-cell RNA sequencing to address this. 4D high-frequency ultrasound imaging of chick embryonic hearts at HH25 (ED 4.5) were obtained for both LAL and control. Motion tracking was performed to quantify strains. Image-based FE modeling was conducted, using the direction of the smallest strain eigenvector as the orientations of contractions, the Guccione active tension model and a Fung-type transversely isotropic passive stiffness model that was determined via micro-pipette aspiration. Single-cell RNA sequencing of left ventricle (LV) heart tissues was performed for normal and LAL embryos at HH30 (ED 6.5) and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified.After LAL, LV thickness increased by 33%, strains in the myofiber direction increased by 42%, while stresses in the myofiber direction decreased by 50%. These were likely related to the reduction in ventricular preload and underloading of the LV due to LAL. RNA-seq data revealed potentially related DEG in myocytes, including mechano-sensing genes (Cadherins, NOTCH1, etc.), myosin contractility genes (MLCK, MLCP, etc.), calcium signaling genes (PI3K, PMCA, etc.), and genes related to fibrosis and fibroelastosis (TGF-\u03b2, BMP, etc.). We elucidated the changes to the myocardial biomechanics brought by LAL and the corresponding changes to myocyte gene expressions. These data may be useful in identifying the mechanobiological pathways of HLHS.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2023-04-10", "authors": ["S SamanehLashkarinia", "Wei XuanChan", "EfthymiosMotakis", "SheldonHo", "Hummaira BanuSiddiqui", "MervenurCoban", "BortecineSevgin", "KeremPekkan", "Choon HwaiYap"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-023-03187-0\n10.4049/jimmunol.1602077\n10.1016/j.cobme.2022.100428\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.148684\n10.1038/nbt.4096\n10.1002/dvdy.21958\n10.1136/openhrt-2016-000415\n10.1038/s41586-018-0110-6\n10.1046/j.1469-0705.1991.01050313.x\n10.1007/s00395-008-0739-7\n10.1126/science.1136800\n10.1002/uog.17530\n10.1159/000460247\n10.1101/cshperspect.a013953\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.947002\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.03.009\n10.1115/1.2895473\n10.1177/1045389X17704921\n10.1007/s10237-021-01447-3\n10.1007/s10439-017-1882-9\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.07.017\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.173005\n10.1038/s41569-018-0100-2\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.588194\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.08.022\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031635\n10.1001/jama.1969.03160260056018\n10.1007/s10439-020-02683-x\n10.1016/j.echo.2014.05.014\n10.1002/dvdy.24521\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2011.11.011\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.05.059\n10.1038/nbt.2931\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1101\n10.1007/s10237-020-01413-5\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.06.021\n10.1002/ar.10098\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(19990201)254:2<238::AID-AR10>3.0.CO;2-V\n10.1007/s10439-015-1339-y\n10.1002/ar.a.20133\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.3.H959\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.3.H959\n10.1152/ajpheart.00879.2001\n10.1038/s41598-020-75525-4\n10.1093/abbs/gmy007"}

Guanxinning injection (GXNI) is clinically used for the treatment of coronary heart disease, but its therapeutic efficacy and potential mechanism for HF are poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of GXNI on HF, with a special focus on its role in myocardial remodeling.\n3D cardiac organoids and transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse models were established and utilized. Heart function and pathology were evaluated by echocardiography, hemodynamic examination, tail-cuff blood pressure and histopathology. Key targets and pathways regulated by GXNI in HF mouse heart were revealed via RNA-seq and network pharmacology analysis, and were verified by RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.\nGXNI significantly inhibited cardiac hypertrophy and cells death. It protected mitochondrial function in cardiac hypertrophic organoids and markedly improved cardiac function in HF mice. Analysis of GXNI-regulated genes in HF mouse hearts revealed that IL-17A signaling in fibroblasts and the corresponding p38/c-Fos/Mmp1 pathway prominently mediated cardiac. Altered expressions of c-Fos, p38 and Mmp1 by GXNI in heart tissues and in cardiac organoids were validated by RT-PCR, WB, IHC, and IF. H&E and Masson staining confirmed that GXNI substantially ameliorated myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis in HF mice and in 3D organoids.\nGXNI inhibited cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy mainly via down-regulating p38/c-Fos/Mmp1 pathway, thereby ameliorating cardiac remodeling in HF mice.

{"title": "Cardiac Adipose Tissue Segmentation via Image-Level Annotations.", "abstract": "Automatically identifying the structural substrates underlying cardiac abnormalities can potentially provide real-time guidance for interventional procedures. With the knowledge of cardiac tissue substrates, the treatment of complex arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia can be further optimized by detecting arrhythmia substrates to target for treatment (i.e., adipose) and identifying critical structures to avoid. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a real-time imaging modality that aids in addressing this need. Existing approaches for cardiac image analysis mainly rely on fully supervised learning techniques, which suffer from the drawback of workload on labor-intensive annotation process of pixel-wise labeling. To lessen the need for pixel-wise labeling, we develop a two-stage deep learning framework for cardiac adipose tissue segmentation using image-level annotations on OCT images of human cardiac substrates. In particular, we integrate class activation mapping with superpixel segmentation to solve the sparse tissue seed challenge raised in cardiac tissue segmentation. Our study bridges the gap between the demand on automatic tissue analysis and the lack of high-quality pixel-wise annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to address cardiac tissue segmentation on OCT images via weakly supervised learning techniques. Within an in-vitro human cardiac OCT dataset, we demonstrate that our weakly supervised approach on image-level annotations achieves comparable performance as fully supervised methods trained on pixel-wise annotations.", "journal": "IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics", "date": "2023-04-07", "authors": ["ZiyiHuang", "YuGan", "TheresaLye", "YanchenLiu", "HaofengZhang", "AndrewLaine", "ElsaAngelini", "ChristineHendon"], "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2023.3263838"}
{"title": "Age-related increases in cardiac excitability, refractoriness and impulse conduction favor arrhythmogenesis in male rats.", "abstract": "The effects of excitability, refractoriness, and impulse conduction have been independently related to enhanced arrhythmias in the aged myocardium in experimental and clinical studies. However, their combined arrhythmic effects in the elderly are not yet completely understood. Hence, the aim of the present work is to relate relevant cardiac electrophysiological parameters to enhanced arrhythmia vulnerability in the in vivo senescent heart. We used multiple-lead epicardial potential mapping in control (9-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) rat hearts. Cardiac excitability and refractoriness were evaluated at numerous epicardial test sites by means of the strength-duration curve and effective refractory period, respectively. During sinus rhythm, durations of electrogram intervals and waves were prolonged in the senescent heart, compared with control, demonstrating a latency in tissue activation and recovery. During ventricular pacing, cardiac excitability, effective refractory period, and dispersion of refractoriness increased in the aged animal. This scenario was accompanied by impairment of impulse propagation. Moreover, both spontaneous and induced arrhythmias were increased in senescent cardiac tissue. Histopathological evaluation of aged heart specimens revealed connective tissue deposition and perinuclear myocytolysis in the atria, while scattered microfoci of interstitial fibrosis were mostly present in the ventricular subendocardium. This work suggests that enhanced arrhythmogenesis in the elderly is a multifactorial process due to the joint increase in excitability and dispersion of refractoriness in association with enhanced conduction inhomogeneity. The knowledge of these electrophysiological changes will possibly contribute to improved prevention of the age-associated increase in cardiac arrhythmias.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2023-04-07", "authors": ["StefanoRossi", "RosarioStatello", "GiovannaPel\u00e0", "FabioLeonardi", "AdervilleCabassi", "RubenForesti", "GiacomoRozzi", "Francesco PaoloLo Muzio", "LucaCarnevali", "AndreaSgoifo", "LucaMagnani", "SergioCallegari", "PaoloPastori", "AlessandroTafuni", "DomenicoCorradi", "MicheleMiragoli", "EmilioMacchi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-023-02812-0\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1994.tb01437.x\n10.1161/01.cir.50.6.1150\n10.1161/01.RES.67.4.871\n10.1002/j.1552-4604.1989.tb03351.x\n10.1093/geronj/10.4.420\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00197-3\n10.1016/j.jacep.2020.06.022\n10.1161/01.CIR.94.7.1674\n10.1016/1056-8719(93)90023-8\n10.1038/ncpcardio1370\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318207a35f\n10.1007/s002100100462\n10.1203/00006450-197602000-00013\n10.1093/geronj/45.3.M95\n10.1016/S0022-0736(00)80073-4\n10.1016/0002-9149(91)90099-7\n10.1016/S0167-5273(97)00183-6\n10.1161/01.RES.14.1.44\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2002.00801.x\n10.1016/0022-0736(89)90032-0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.03.044\n10.1016/0002-9149(87)90795-8\n10.1016/0022-0736(88)90111-2\n10.1172/JCI107918\n10.1016/B978-012656975-9/50044-4\n10.1016/S0022-0736(98)80071-X\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.12.007\n10.1007/s11010-020-03899-0\n10.1016/0735-1097(94)90560-6\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.274.3.H747\n10.1093/cvr/cvz112\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61307-0\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1999.tb00192.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.95.4.988\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2004.08.037\n10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352311\n10.1152/ajpheart.00517.2008\n10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117163\n10.1371/journal.pone.0112697\n10.3389/fcvm.2021.646932\n10.1152/ajpheart.1992.262.1.H97\n10.1038/ncomms9803\n10.1161/01.RES.58.3.356\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.10.033\n10.1136/hrt.55.6.575\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000117402.70689.75\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.539072\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.044\n10.1016/s0140-6736(96)02149-6\n10.1093/cvr/27.11.1968\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1483"}

A key metric of EHT phenotype is the contractile (twitch) force with which the tissue spontaneously beats. It is well-known that cardiac muscle contractility - its ability to do mechanical work - depends on tissue prestrain (preload) and external resistance (afterload).\nHere, we demonstrate a technique to control afterload while monitoring contractile force exerted by EHTs.\nWe developed an apparatus that can regulate EHT boundary conditions using real-time feedback control. The system is comprised of a pair of piezoelectric actuators that can strain the scaffold and a microscope that can measure EHT force and length. Closed loop control allows dynamic regulation of effective EHT boundary stiffness.\nWhen controlled to switch instantaneously from auxotonic to isometric boundary conditions, EHT twitch force immediately doubled. Changes in EHT twitch force as a function of effective boundary stiffness were characterized and compared to twitch force in auxotonic conditions.\nEHT contractility can be regulated dynamically through feedback control of effective boundary stiffness.\nThe capacity to alter the mechanical boundary conditions of an engineered tissue dynamically offers a new way to probe tissue mechanics.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) are an important component of guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure to improve clinical outcomes. Clinical trial evidence in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) informed a strong guideline recommendation for use of MRA in symptomatic patients, barring contraindications. In heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), data are less robust, and this drug class received a weaker recommendation in the heart failure treatment guidelines. Thus, careful selection of patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF who are most likely to benefit from MRA is paramount to better optimize use of these medications. The purpose of this narrative review is to outline the rationale for the use of MRA in heart failure, summarize the clinical trial evidence for MRA in HFmrEF/HFpEF, discuss clinical considerations for their use, and describe investigations of nonsteroidal MRA in HFmrEF/HFpEF.", "journal": "Pharmacotherapy", "date": "2023-04-07", "authors": ["OrlyVardeny", "HaileeHoule"], "doi": "10.1002/phar.2801"}

This study investigated the combined effects of exercise training and melatonin (Mel) on the function of heart tissue in diabetic rodent models.\nA systematic search was conducted in Embase, ProQuest, Cochrane library, Clinicaltrial.gov, WHO, Google Scholar, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, Web of Science, Ongoing Trials Registers, and Conference Proceedings in July 2022 with no limit of date or language. All trials associated with the effect of Mel and exercise in diabetic rodent models were included. Of the 962 relevant publications, 58 studies met our inclusion criteria as follows; Mel and type 1 DM (16 studies), Mel and type 2 DM (6 studies), exercise and type 1 DM (24 studies), and exercise and type 2 DM (12 studies). Meta-analysis of the data was done using the Mantel Haenszel method.\nIn most of these studies, antioxidant status and oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis rate, lipid profiles, and glucose levels were monitored in diabetic heart tissue. According to our findings, both Mel and exercise can improve antioxidant capacity by activating antioxidant enzymes compared to the control diabetic groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-\u03b1 were reduced in diabetic rodents after being treated with Mel and exercise. Apoptotic changes were diminished in diabetic rodents subjected to the Mel regime and exercise in which p53 levels and the activity of Caspases reached near normal levels (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Based on the data, both Mel and exercise can change the lipid profile in diabetic rodents, especially rats, and close it to near-to-control levels.\nThese data showed that exercise and Mel can reduce the harmful effects of diabetic conditions on the heart through the regulation of lipid profile, antioxidant capacity, apoptosis, and inflammation.", "journal": "Diabetology & metabolic syndrome", "date": "2023-04-04", "authors": ["AfshinRahbarghazi", "Karim AzaliAlamdari", "RezaRahbarghazi", "HaniehSalehi-Pourmehr"], "doi": "10.1186/s13098-023-01045-6\n10.3897/pharmacia.67.e55437\n10.1038/s41392-022-01054-3\n10.2337/dc13-S011\n10.1016/j.jsbmb.2021.105948\n10.3389/fendo.2017.00343\n10.1038/nri2925\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06474\n10.1021/acssensors.1c02305\n10.1002/path.4113\n10.1046/j.1600-079X.2003.00092.x\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.12.002\n10.1016/j.tice.2021.101486\n10.1034/j.1600-079X.2003.00041.x\n10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.11.011\n10.1016/j.mehy.2008.06.024\n10.1371/journal.pone.0184122\n10.1002/cbf.1006\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2018.03.012\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.08.002\n10.1111/jpi.12375\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.035\n10.1111/jpi.12491\n10.1111/jpi.12418\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.05.018\n10.9734/jpri/2021/v33i58A34124\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.11.007\n10.15171/apb.2015.032\n10.1055/s-0035-1569332\n10.5812/jjnpp.62898\n10.2174/1871530320666200420084444\n10.2147/DMSO.S197127\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00117.2017\n10.3390/antiox8120638\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.01.031\n10.1002/jcp.27038\n10.32604/mcb.2020.011532\n10.21873/invivo.11396\n10.1155/2015/457848\n10.1007/s00109-019-01861-2\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.03.077\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317604\n10.1007/s10571-009-9367-5\n10.1016/j.bspc.2023.104641\n10.1002/jnr.24220\n10.3389/fphys.2020.00366\n10.1080/10715762.2021.1939024\n10.1002/jcb.26174\n10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109821\n10.1016/j.snb.2022.132315\n10.1093/cvr/cvx012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.302317\n10.1155/2014/847827\n10.5099/aj110400241\n10.1186/s13098-020-00537-z\n10.1111/jpi.12542\n10.1210/en.2013-1345\n10.1007/s11011-011-9264-8\n10.1016/S0021-9290(02)00055-6\n10.1016/j.cccn.2003.10.003\n10.15171/ijbsm.2017.32\n10.3892/mmr.2013.1439\n10.1002/dmrr.3060\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.01.020\n10.1016/j.biopha.2005.08.005\n10.3390/molecules23081999\n10.3390/antiox10081178\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.02.054\n10.1016/S1095-6433(03)00114-4\n10.4103/2277-9175.139191\n10.2298/ABS210111004S\n10.1155/2021/9793010\n10.1111/jcmm.13802\n10.31688/ABMU.2019.54.2.06\n10.1096/fj.201902692R\n10.1007/s40200-022-00982-9\n10.3389/fendo.2022.812032\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.095000\n10.1139/cjpp-2012-0294\n10.1007/s11332-020-00631-9\n10.1007/s00395-016-0559-0\n10.1016/j.lfs.2012.09.007\n10.1111/jcmm.12589\n10.1556/2060.106.2019.06\n10.1007/s12265-019-09875-4\n10.1016/j.mvr.2021.104212"}

{"title": "Liquiritigenin Attenuated Collagen-Induced Arthritis and Cardiac Complication via Inflammation and Fibrosis Inhibition in Mice.", "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Liquiritigenin (LG) is a triterpene with anti-inflammatory properties. Our study aimed to explore the effect of LG on RA and the cardiac complication. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice with LG treatment exhibited obvious alleviation in histopathological changes, accompanied by the decreased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-17A in synovium and serum. LG attenuated cartilage destruction by reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13 expression in the synovium of CIA mice. The echocardiography results proved the alleviation of cardiac dysfunction in CIA mice. The electrocardiogram, biochemical, and histochemical analysis proved the cardioprotection effect of LG against RA. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) and fibrotic markers (fibronectin, Collagen I, and Collagen III) in cardiac tissues of CIA mice further corroborated the attenuation of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis by LG. Mechanistic studies showed that LG could inhibit transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 (TGF-\u03b21) and phos-Smad2/3 expression in cardiac tissues of CIA mice. Our study suggested that LG could relieve RA and its cardiac complication probably by inhibiting the TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 pathway. All these suggested that LG might be a potential candidate for RA and its cardiac complication therapy.", "journal": "Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin", "date": "2023-04-03", "authors": ["XiaoranNing", "YanhuiNi", "JingjingCao", "HuaxingZhang"], "doi": "10.1248/cpb.c22-00684"}

Current treatments can relieve the symptoms of myocardial ischemia but cannot repair the necrotic myocardial tissue. Novel therapeutic strategies based on cellular therapy, extracellular vesicles, non-coding RNAs and growth factors have been designed to restore cardiac function while inducing cardiomyocyte cycle re-entry, ensuring angiogenesis and cardioprotection, and preventing ventricular remodeling. However, they face low stability, cell engraftment issues or enzymatic degradation in vivo, and it is thus essential to combine them with biomaterial-based delivery systems. Microcarriers, nanocarriers, cardiac patches and injectable hydrogels have yielded promising results in preclinical studies, some of which are currently being tested in clinical trials. In this review, we cover the recent advances made in cellular and acellular therapies used for cardiac repair after MI. We present current trends in cardiac tissue engineering related to the use of microcarriers, nanocarriers, cardiac patches and injectable hydrogels as biomaterial-based delivery systems for biologics.

However, these cardiomyocytes remained immature. Incorporating hPSC-derived epicardial cells has been shown to improve cardiomyocyte maturation, but the exact mechanisms are unknown. We posited epicardial fibronectin (FN1) as a mediator of epicardial-cardiomyocyte crosstalk and assessed its role in driving hPSC-derived cardiomyocyte maturation in 3D-engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We found that the loss of FN1 with peptide inhibition F(pUR4), CRISPR-Cas9-mediated FN1 knockout, or tetracycline-inducible FN1 knockdown in 3D-EHTs resulted in immature cardiomyocytes with decreased contractile function, and inefficient Ca", "journal": "Stem cell reports", "date": "2023-04-01", "authors": ["Lay PingOng", "JohannesBargehr", "Vincent RKnight-Schrijver", "JonathanLee", "MariaColzani", "SemihBayraktar", "William GBernard", "SilviaMarchiano", "AlessandroBertero", "Charles EMurry", "LaureGambardella", "SanjaySinha"], "doi": "10.1016/j.stemcr.2023.03.002\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.07.005\n10.1038/s41587-019-0197-9\n10.1242/dev.138081\n10.1002/cpsc.45\n10.1038/nature13233.Human\n10.1161/01.RES.82.10.1043\n10.1002/dvdy.20685\n10.1016/j.devcel.2008.12.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.301275\n10.1242/dev.119271\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1038/s44161-022-00183-w\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.08.002\n10.1016/j.mod.2010.08.005\n10.1101/cshperspect.a005041\n10.1038/nature11317.hESC-Derived\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1126/scisignal.aaz0274\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.08.012\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1101/cshperspect.a005116\n10.1093/eurjhf/hft064\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.25"}

Ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11), a deubiquitinating enzyme, could remove the ubiquitination of substrate proteins and regulate protein stability, thereby affecting multiple pathological processes.\nTo investigate the potential function of USP11 in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and its underlying mechanisms.\nIn vivo and in vitro experimental study.\nThe ischemia-reperfusion rat model in vivo was evolved, wherein the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 30 min, followed by ligature release for 120 min. Meanwhile, H9C2 cells were brought to hypoxia for 6 h and then reoxygenated for 18 h to establish a cell hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury in vitro. Then, the loss-of-function experiments of USP11 were performed. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to observe myocardial injury. The MTT assay was utilized to detect H9C2 cell viability. Pyroptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Pyroptosis-related protein expression and TRAF3 were analyzed via Western blot. The content of inflammatory factors was examined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays were performed to analyze for USP11 interacting with TRAF3.\nUSP11 was upregulated in the ischemic heart tissue. Ischemia-reperfusion and H/R injuries increased USP11 expression. USP11 loss-of-function assays showed that USP11 knockdown alleviated ischemia-reperfusion- and H/R-induced myocardial cell damage, pyroptosis, pro-inflammatory factor secretion, and IKK\u03b2/NF-\u03baB pathway activation. In H9C2 cells, USP11 stabilized TRAF3 by deubiquitination. Furthermore, rescue experiments revealed that TRAF3 overexpression reversed the protection of silencing USP11 on H/R-induced H9C2 cell injury.\nThis study confirmed that USP11 knockdown ameliorated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by downregulating TRAF3, suggesting that USP11 silencing can be a novel target of myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Balkan medical journal", "date": "2023-04-01", "authors": ["YunfeiZhang", "JuledeziHailati", "XiaoyunMa", "HasidaerMidilibieke", "ZhiqiangLiu"], "doi": "10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2023.2022-12-15"}

The recent evidences support their role in mitigating oxidative stress-induced diseases, including cancer. Therefore, this study investigated cardioprotective potential of mito-TEMPO against 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.\nMito-TEMPO was administered to male BALB/C mice (intraperitoneally, 0.1\u00a0mg/kg b.w. for 7\u00a0days) followed by intraperitoneal administration of 5- FU (12\u00a0mg/kg b.w. for 4\u00a0days). During this period, mito-TEMPO treatment was also continued. The cardioprotective potential of mito-TEMPO was assessed by evaluating cardiac injury markers, extent of non-viable myocardium and histopathological alterations. Mitochondrial functional status and mitochondrial oxidative stress were assessed in cardiac tissue. 8-OHdG expression and apoptotic cell death were assessed using immunohistochemical techniques.\nThe level of cardiac injury markers CK-MB and AST were significantly (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) decreased in mito-TEMPO pre-protected group which was further reflected in histopathology as decrease in the percentage of non-viable myocardial tissue, disorganization, and loss of myofibrils.

A decreased expression of 8-OHdG and reduced apoptotic cell death were observed in mito-TEMPO pre-protected group.\nMito-TEMPO effectively mitigated 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity by modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress, hence may serve as a protective agent/adjuvant in 5-FU-based combinatorial chemotherapy.", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2023-03-31", "authors": ["Prasad KisanTambe", "A JesilMathew", "SanjayBharati"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-023-04529-4\n10.1016/j.tox.2021.153042\n10.1021/acsomega.1c06475\n10.1021/acsomega.8b02139\n10.1080/14756360500508416\n10.12659/MSM.910537\n10.3109/00498254.2014.942809\n10.3390/nu11040879\n10.1016/j.drudis.2018.01.021\n10.1038/nchembio.1712\n10.1007/s12640-022-00501-x\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.09.007\n10.1007/S00280-015-2949-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0225185\n10.1016/j.taap.2022.116211\n10.1016/j.lfs.2009.11.003\n10.1016/j.mito.2021.03.001\n10.1177/0748233712446728\n10.1016/0003-9861(59)90090-6\n10.1007/s002449900510\n10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00056-8\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.03.037\n10.22092/ari.2019.126702.1356\n10.1096/fj.15-275404\n10.1038/sj/bjc/6600208\n10.1016/J.TOX.2022.153113\n10.21608/ejchem.2022.114858.5215\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.10.008\n10.1007/s12192-022-01273-1\n10.3892/etm.2021.10886\n10.1002/tox.21817\n10.1016/j.cbi.2013.11.008\n10.1080/13813455.2017.1422766\n10.1634/theoncologist.12-9-1124\n10.1016/j.taap.2016.01.006\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6272\n10.1289/ehp.01109s127\n10.1016/j.ccl.2019.07.004"}
{"title": "Targeting neuro-immune systems to achieve cardiac tissue repair following myocardial infarction: A review of therapeutic approaches from in-vivo preclinical to clinical studies.", "abstract": "Myocardial healing following myocardial infarction (MI) toward either functional tissue repair or excessive scarring/heart failure, may depend on a complex interplay between nervous and immune system responses, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury factors, as well as genetic and epidemiological factors. Hence, enhancing cardiac repair post MI may require a more patient-specific approach targeting this complex interplay and not just the heart, bearing in mind that the dysregulation or modulation of just one of these systems or some of their mechanisms may determine the outcome either toward functional repair or toward heart failure. In this review we have elected to focus on existing preclinical and clinical in-vivo studies aimed at testing novel therapeutic approaches targeting the nervous and immune systems to trigger myocardial healing toward functional tissue repair. To this end, we have only selected clinical and preclinical in-vivo studies reporting on novel treatments targeting neuro-immune systems to ultimately treat MI. Next, we have grouped and reported treatments under each neuro-immune system. Finally, for each treatment we have assessed and reported the results of each clinical/preclinical study and then discussed their results collectively. This structured approach has been followed for each treatment discussed. To keep this review focused, we have deliberately omitted to cover other important and related research areas such as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, cell and gene therapies as well as any ex-vivo and in-vitro studies. The review indicates that some of the treatments targeting the neuro-immune/inflammatory systems appear to induce beneficial effects remotely on the healing heart post MI, warranting further validation. These remote effects on the heart also indicates the presence of an overarching synergic response occurring across the nervous and immune systems in response to acute MI, which appear to influence cardiac tissue repair in different ways depending on age and timing of treatment delivery following MI. The cumulative evidence arising from this review allows also to make informed considerations on safe as opposed to detrimental treatments, and within the safe treatments to ascertain those associated with conflicting or supporting preclinical data, and those warranting further validation.", "journal": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "date": "2023-03-31", "authors": ["SarahSmith", "RaimondoAscione"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2023.108397"}

EA at the acupoint \"Neiguan (PC6)\" was applied 0.5\u00a0h after the induction of sepsis for 20\u00a0min. Heart rate variability was obtained immediately after EA to evaluate autonomic balance.

Compared with other bacteria used for construction of hypoxia targeted bacteria micro-robot, the Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) bacteria are nonpathogenic Gram-negative probiotic and can especially target and identify the signal molecules in the hypoxic region of tumor, and thus, in this study, we choose EcN to construct a bacteria propelled micro-robot for targeting intestinal tumor therapy. Firstly, the MSNs@DOX with average diameter of 200\u00a0nm were synthesized and conjugated with EcN bacteria using EDC/NHS chemical crosslinking method to construct a EcN propelled micro-robot. The motility of micro-robot was then evaluated and the motion velocity of EcN-pMSNs@DOX was 3.78\u00a0\u00b5m/s. Compared with pMSNs@DOX without EcN driven, EcN bacteria propelled micro-robot transported much more pMSNs@DOX into the inner of HCT-116 3D multicellular tumor spheroids. However, the EcN bacteria are non-intracelluar bacteria which lead to the micro-robot can not directly enter into tumor cells. Therefore, we utilized acid-labile linkers of cis-aconitic amido bone to link EcN with MSNs@DOX nanoparticles to achieve the pH sensitive separation of EcN with MSNs@DOX from the micro-robot. At 4\u00a0h of incubation, the isolated MSNs@DOX began to enter into the tumor cells through CLSM observation. In vitro live/dead staining results show that EcN-pMSNs@DOX induced much more cell death than pMSNs@DOX at 24 and 48\u00a0h of incubation with HCT-116 tumor cells in acid culture media (pH 5.3). For the validation of the therapeutic efficacy of the micro-robot for intestinal tumor, we established the HCT-116 subcutaneous transplantation tumor model.

{"title": "A Novel HIF-2\u03b1/ARNT Signaling Pathway Protects Against Microvascular Dysfunction and heart failure After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Cardiac microvascular leakage and inflammation are triggered during myocardial infarction (MI) and contribute to heart failure. Hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1 (Hif2\u03b1) is highly expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) and rapidly activated by myocardial ischemia, but whether it has a role in endothelial barrier function during MI is unclear.\nTo test our hypothesis that the expression of Hif2\u03b1 and its binding partner aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) in ECs regulate cardiac microvascular permeability in infarcted hearts.\nExperiments were conducted with mice carrying an inducible EC-specific Hif2\u03b1-knockout (ecHif2\u03b1-/-) mutation, with mouse cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMVECs) isolated from the hearts of ecHif2\u03b1-/- mice after the mutation was induced, and with human CMVECs and umbilical-vein endothelial cells transfected with ecHif2\u03b1 siRNA. After MI induction, echocardiographic assessments of cardiac function were significantly lower, while measures of cardiac microvascular leakage (Evans blue assay), plasma IL6 levels, and cardiac neutrophil accumulation and fibrosis (histology) were significantly greater, in ecHif2\u03b1-/- mice than in control mice, and RNA-sequencing analysis of heart tissues from both groups indicated that the expression of genes involved in vascular permeability and collagen synthesis was enriched in ecHif2\u03b1-/- hearts. In cultured ECs, ecHif2\u03b1 deficiency was associated with declines in endothelial barrier function (electrical cell impedance assay) and the reduced abundance of tight-junction proteins, as well as an increase in the expression of inflammatory markers, all of which were largely reversed by the overexpression of ARNT. We also found that ARNT, but not Hif2\u03b1, binds directly to the IL6 promoter and suppresses IL6 expression.\nEC-specific deficiencies in Hif2\u03b1 expression significantly increase cardiac microvascular permeability, promote inflammation, and reduce cardiac function in infarcted mouse hearts, and ARNT overexpression can reverse the upregulation of inflammatory genes and restore endothelial-barrier function in Hif2\u03b1-deficient ECs.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2023-03-31", "authors": ["KarimUllah", "LizhuoAi", "YanLi", "LifengLiu", "QinZhang", "KaichaoPan", "ZainabHumayun", "AlbertSitikov", "QiaozhuSu", "QiongZhao", "Willard WSharp", "YunFang", "DavidWu", "James KLiao", "RongxueWu"], "doi": "10.1101/2023.03.12.532316"}

{"title": "MLATE: Machine learning for predicting cell behavior on cardiac tissue engineering scaffolds.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide and is responsible for millions of deaths annually. One of the most promising approaches to deal with this problem, which has spread recently, is cardiac tissue engineering (CTE). Many researchers have tried developing scaffolds with different materials, cell lines, and fabrication methods to help regenerate heart tissue. Machine learning (ML) is one of the hottest topics in science and technology, revolutionizing many fields and changing our perspective on solving problems. As a result of using ML, some scientific issues have been resolved, including protein-folding, a challenging problem in biology that remained unsolved for 50 years. However, it is not well addressed in tissue engineering. An AI-based software was developed by our group called MLATE (Machine Learning Applications in Tissue Engineering) to tackle tissue engineering challenges, which highly depend on conducting costly and time-consuming experiments. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a CTE scaffold dataset was created by collecting specifications from the literature, including different materials, cell lines, and fabrication methods commonly used in CTE scaffold development. These specifications were used as variables in the study. Then, the CTE scaffolds were rated based on cell behaviors such as cell viability, growth, proliferation, and differentiation on the scaffold on a scale of 0-3. These ratings were considered a function of the variables in the gathered dataset. It should be stated that this study was merely based on information available in the literature. Then, twenty-eight ML algorithms were applied to determine the most effective one for predicting cell behavior on CTE scaffolds fabricated by different materials, compositions, and methods. The results indicated the high performance of XGBoost with an accuracy of 87%. Also, by implementing ensemble learning algorithms and using five algorithms with the best performance, an accuracy of 93% with the AdaBoost Classifier and Voting Classifier was achieved.

{"title": "Regulation of Hypoxic-Adenosinergic Signaling by Estrogen: Implications for Microvascular Injury.", "abstract": "Loss of estrogen, as occurs with normal aging, leads to increased inflammation, pathologic angiogenesis, impaired mitochondrial function, and microvascular disease. While the influence of estrogens on purinergic pathways is largely unknown, extracellular adenosine, generated at high levels by CD39 and CD73, is known to be anti-inflammatory in the vasculature. To further define the cellular mechanisms necessary for vascular protection, we investigated how estrogen modulates hypoxic-adenosinergic vascular signaling responses and angiogenesis. Expression of estrogen receptors, purinergic mediators inclusive of adenosine, adenosine deaminase (ADA), and ATP were measured in human endothelial cells. Standard tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to assess angiogenesis in vitro. The impacts on purinergic responses in vivo were modeled using cardiac tissue from ovariectomized mice. CD39 and estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) levels were markedly increased in presence of estradiol (E2). Suppression of ER\u03b1 resulted in decreased CD39 expression. Expression of ENT1 was decreased in an ER-dependent manner. Extracellular ATP and ADA activity levels decreased following E2 exposure while levels of adenosine increased. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 increased following E2 treatment and was attenuated by blocking adenosine receptor (AR) and ER activity. Estradiol boosted angiogenesis, while inhibition of estrogen decreased tube formation in vitro. Expression of CD39 and phospho-ERK1/2 decreased in cardiac tissues from ovariectomized mice, whereas ENT1 expression increased with expected decreases in blood adenosine levels. Estradiol-induced upregulation of CD39 substantially increases adenosine availability, while augmenting vascular protective signaling responses. Control of CD39 by ER\u03b1 follows on transcriptional regulation. These data suggest novel therapeutic avenues to explore in the amelioration of post-menopausal cardiovascular disease, by modulation of adenosinergic mechanisms.", "journal": "Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-03-30", "authors": ["JessicaCassavaugh", "NadaQureshi", "EvaCsizmadia", "Maria SerenaLonghi", "RobinaMatyal", "Simon CRobson"], "doi": "10.3390/ph16030422\n10.1089/jwh.2019.7826\n10.1056/NEJMra061889\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.042\n10.1152/ajpheart.00396.2018\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034271\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.02.092\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.302922\n10.3389/fendo.2019.00442\n10.1093/nar/29.14.2905\n10.1172/JCI38291\n10.1021/bi990543p\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309726\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.106.126714\n10.1056/NEJMra1205750\n10.1016/j.jhep.2020.06.044\n10.1165/rcmb.2017-0167OC\n10.1182/blood-2008-06-165746\n10.7150/ijms.26774\n10.1210/endo.142.4.8096\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.03.022\n10.1080/09537100500124400\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.03.024\n10.1160/TH03-06-0373\n10.1210/endo.140.1.6394\n10.1161/hy0202.103075\n10.1084/jem.20030891\n10.1124/jpet.107.119933\n10.1096/fj.06-6419com\n10.4103/1735-5362.220968\n10.3390/ijms21197145\n10.1161/01.RES.0000172568.49367.f8\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.132\n10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01181-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.00841.2016\n10.1016/S1385-299X(02)00219-2\n10.1001/jama.2013.278040\n10.1038/onc.2012.269\n10.1136/jitc-2021-004089\n10.1038/nrd2638\n10.1007/s10557-021-07224-9"}

{"title": "Effects of Simulated 5-Ion Galactic Cosmic Radiation on Function and Structure of the Mouse Heart.", "abstract": "Missions into deep space will expose astronauts to the harsh space environment, and the degenerative tissue effects of space radiation are largely unknown. To assess the risks, in this study, male BALB/c mice were exposed to 500 mGy 5-ion simulated GCR (GCRsim) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory. In addition, male and female CD1 mice were exposed to GCRsim and administered a diet containing Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2)RI kinase (ALK5) inhibitor IPW-5371 as a potential countermeasure. An ultrasound was performed to investigate cardiac function. Cardiac tissue was collected to determine collagen deposition, the density of the capillary network, and the expression of the immune mediator toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and immune cell markers CD2, CD4, and CD45. In male BALB/c mice, the only significant effects of GCRsim were an increase in the CD2 and TLR4 markers. In male CD1 mice, GCRsim caused a significant increase in total collagens and a decrease in the expression of TLR4, both of which were mitigated by the TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor diet. In female CD1 mice, GCRsim caused an increase in the number of capillaries per tissue area in the ventricles, which may be explained by the decrease in the left ventricular mass. However, this increase was not mitigated by TGF-\u03b2 inhibition. In both male and female CD1 mice, the combination of GCRsim and TGF-\u03b2 inhibition caused changes in left ventricular immune cell markers that were not seen with GCRsim alone. These data suggest that GCRsim results in minor changes to cardiac tissue in both an inbred and outbred mouse strain.

{"title": "microRNAs as Biomarkers of Endothelial Dysfunction and Therapeutic Target in the Pathogenesis of Atrial Fibrillation.", "abstract": "The pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) may involve atrial fibrosis/remodeling and dysfunctional endothelial activities. Despite the currently available treatment approaches, the progression of AF, its recurrence rate, and the high mortality risk of related complications underlay the need for more advanced prognostic and therapeutic strategies. There is increasing attention on the molecular mechanisms controlling AF onset and progression points to the complex cell to cell interplay that triggers fibroblasts, immune cells and myofibroblasts, enhancing atrial fibrosis. In this scenario, endothelial cell dysfunction (ED) might play an unexpected but significant role. microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In the cardiovascular compartment, both free circulating and exosomal miRNAs entail the control of plaque formation, lipid metabolism, inflammation and angiogenesis, cardiomyocyte growth and contractility, and even the maintenance of cardiac rhythm. Abnormal miRNAs levels may indicate the activation state of circulating cells, and thus represent a specific read-out of cardiac tissue changes. Although several unresolved questions still limit their clinical use, the ease of accessibility in biofluids and their prognostic and diagnostic properties make them novel and attractive biomarker candidates in AF.

{"title": "Advances in 3D Organoid Models for Stem Cell-Based Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "The adult human heart cannot regain complete cardiac function following tissue injury, making cardiac regeneration a current clinical unmet need. There are a number of clinical procedures aimed at reducing ischemic damage following injury; however, it has not yet been possible to stimulate adult cardiomyocytes to recover and proliferate. The emergence of pluripotent stem cell technologies and 3D culture systems has revolutionized the field. Specifically, 3D culture systems have enhanced precision medicine through obtaining a more accurate human microenvironmental condition to model disease and/or drug interactions in vitro. In this study, we cover current advances and limitations in stem cell-based cardiac regenerative medicine.

{"title": "Plant-Derived Biomaterials and Their Potential in Cardiac Tissue Repair.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The inability of cardiac tissue to regenerate after an infarction results in scar tissue formation, leading to cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, cardiac repair has always been a popular research topic. Recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine offer promising solutions combining stem cells and biomaterials to construct tissue substitutes that could have functions similar to healthy cardiac tissue. Among these biomaterials, plant-derived biomaterials show great promise in supporting cell growth due to their inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical stability. More importantly, plant-derived materials have reduced immunogenic properties compared to popular animal-derived materials (e.g., collagen and gelatin). In addition, they also offer improved wettability compared to synthetic materials. To date, limited literature is available to systemically summarize the progression of plant-derived biomaterials in cardiac tissue repair. Herein, this paper highlights the most common plant-derived biomaterials from both land and marine plants. The beneficial properties of these materials for tissue repair are further discussed. More importantly, the applications of plant-derived biomaterials in cardiac tissue engineering, including tissue-engineered scaffolds, bioink in 3D biofabrication, delivery vehicles, and bioactive molecules, are also summarized using the latest preclinical and clinical examples.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2023-03-29", "authors": ["YichenDai", "KaiQiao", "DeminLi", "PhocasIsingizwe", "HaohaoLiu", "YuLiu", "KhoonLim", "TimWoodfield", "GuozhenLiu", "JinmingHu", "JieYuan", "JunnanTang", "XiaolinCui"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202202827"}

{"title": "Electrical Stimulation Promotes the Vascularization and Functionalization of an Engineered Biomimetic Human Cardiac Tissue.", "abstract": "The formation of multiscale vascular networks is essential for the in vitro construction of large-scale biomimetic cardiac tissues/organs. Although a variety of bioprinting processes have been developed to achieve the construction of mesoscale and large-scale blood vessels, the formation of microvascular networks still mainly depends on the self-assembly behavior of endothelial cells (ECs), which is inefficient and demanding without appropriate stimulus. To address this problem, the elongation and connection of endothelial cells in engineered cardiac tissue (ECT) are sought to promote by electrical stimulation (ES) to achieve vascularization. As proof of the concept, bio-inks are composed of GelMA/fibrin hydrogel, human pluripotent stem cells induced cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are used for the bioprinting of ECTs. It is demonstrated that electrical stimulation significantly promotes the elongation, migration, and interconnection of HUVECs in ECT and increases the expression of related genes. Moreover, ES also enhances the secretion of signal factors interacting between CMs and HUVECs. It seems that the HUVECs further strengthen the contractility of cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Treatment with benznidazole and pentoxifylline regulates microRNA transcriptomic profile in a murine model of Chagas chronic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disorders in endemic areas of Chagas disease (CD), a neglected tropical illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. CCC is characterized by parasite persistence and inflammatory response in the heart tissue, which occur parallel to microRNA (miRNA) alterations. Here, we investigated the miRNA transcriptome profiling in the cardiac tissue of chronically T. cruzi-infected mice treated with a suboptimal dose of benznidazole (Bz), the immunomodulator pentoxifylline alone (PTX), or the combination of both (Bz+PTX), following the CCC onset. At 150 days post-infection, Bz, PTX, and Bz+PTX treatment regimens improved electrocardiographic alterations, reducing the percentage of mice afflicted by sinus arrhythmia and second-degree atrioventricular block (AVB2) when compared with the vehicle-treated animals. miRNA Transcriptome profiling revealed considerable changes in the differential expression of miRNAs in the Bz and Bz+PTX treatment groups compared with the control (infected, vehicle-treated) group. The latter showed pathways related to organismal abnormalities, cellular development, skeletal muscle development, cardiac enlargement, and fibrosis, likely associated with CCC. Bz-Treated mice exhibited 68 differentially expressed miRNAs related to signaling pathways like cell cycle, cell death and survival, tissue morphology, and connective tissue function. Finally, the Bz+PTX-treated group revealed 58 differentially expressed miRNAs associated with key signaling pathways related to cellular growth and proliferation, tissue development, cardiac fibrosis, damage, and necrosis/cell death. The T. cruzi-induced upregulation of miR-146b-5p, previously shown in acutely infected mice and in vitro T. cruzi-infected cardiomyocytes, was reversed upon Bz and Bz+PTX treatment regimens when further experimentally validated. Our results further our understanding of molecular pathways related to CCC progression and evaluation of treatment response.

{"title": "Three-dimensional catheter tip force sensing using multi-core fiber Bragg gratings.", "abstract": "Awareness of catheter tip interaction forces is a crucial aspect during cardiac ablation procedures. The most important contact forces are the ones that originate between the catheter tip and the beating cardiac tissue. Clinical studies have shown that effective ablation occurs when contact forces are in the proximity of 0.2\u00a0N. Lower contact forces lead to ineffective ablation, while higher contact forces may result in complications such as cardiac perforation. Accurate and high resolution force sensing is therefore indispensable in such critical situations. Accordingly, this work presents the development of a unique and novel catheter tip force sensor utilizing a multi-core fiber with inscribed fiber Bragg gratings. A customizable helical compression spring is designed to serve as the flexural component relaying external forces to the multi-core fiber. The limited number of components, simple construction, and compact nature of the sensor makes it an appealing solution towards clinical translation. An elaborated approach is proposed for the design and dimensioning of the necessary sensor components. The approach also presents a unique method to decouple longitudinal and lateral force measurements. A force sensor prototype and a dedicated calibration setup are developed to experimentally validate the theoretical performance. Results show that the proposed force sensor exhibits 7.4\u00a0mN longitudinal resolution, 0.8\u00a0mN lateral resolution, 0.72\u00a0mN mean longitudinal error, 0.96\u00a0mN mean lateral error, a high repeatability, and excellent decoupling between longitudinal and lateral forces.", "journal": "Frontiers in robotics and AI", "date": "2023-03-28", "authors": ["OmarAl-Ahmad", "MouloudOurak", "JohanVlekken", "EricLindner", "EmmanuelVander Poorten"], "doi": "10.3389/frobt.2023.1154494\n10.3390/s140406633\n10.1109/lra.2020.3003291\n10.3389/frobt.2021.718033\n10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794301\n10.1109/access.2019.2962636\n10.1111/jce.13100\n10.1111/jce.12886\n10.1007/s10840-012-9672-7\n10.1161/circep.108.824789\n10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.02.002\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.01.044\n10.1109/tie.2018.2798569\n10.1109/tbme.2013.2283501\n10.1136/pmj.79.928.67\n10.1186/s12889-022-14403-2\n10.1109/tie.2019.2926052\n10.1109/jsen.2018.2861014\n10.1364/oe.20.002967\n10.1109/jsen.2016.2600671\n10.3389/frobt.2021.705662\n10.1109/tmech.2011.2181405\n10.1109/jsen.2010.2043732\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010\n10.1109/jsen.2017.2779153\n10.1109/tbme.2016.2622361\n10.1109/MeMeA.2018.8438714\n10.1007/s10544-018-0294-4\n10.1007/s10840-007-9200-3\n10.1002/rcs.301\n10.1109/jsen.2017.2654489\n10.3390/s131014105\n10.14744/anatoljcardiol.2016.7512\n10.1109/tmrb.2022.3142361\n10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2016.7512"}

{"title": "Blood prestin levels in COVID-19 patients.", "abstract": "Many studies have found that viral infections affect different tissues, including the inner ear. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral infection, is a significant health problem worldwide. Prestin is a motor protein with important functions both in the outer hair cells of the inner ear and in cardiac tissue. In addition, prestin is promising as an early biomarker in the detection of ototoxicity. To determine the severity of infection in COVID-19 patients and to determine whether other tissues are affected by the infection, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), biochemical markers such as ferritin and D-dimer are used. This study aimed to compare prestin levels in patients with COVID-19 and healthy volunteers.\nIn blood samples taken from 45 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 40 healthy volunteers, prestin levels were determined with the kit that used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method and was commercially available. At the same time, LDH, CRP, ALT, AST, CK-MB, ferritin, and D-dimer levels were also detected in both patients and healthy control groups and correlations with prestin levels were examined.\nThe main result of our study is that serum prestin levels in COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in healthy controls ( p < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant strong positive correlation was found between prestin-LDL ( r = 0.537, p = 0.001), prestin-CRP ( r = 0.654, p = 0.001), and prestin-D-dimer ( r = 0.659, p = 0.001).\nThe levels of prestin, a motor protein in inner ear outer hair cells and cardiac myocytes, were found to be higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy volunteers.

{"title": "Glycine protects against doxorubicin-induced heart toxicity in mice.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOXO) is a well-known cancer chemotherapeutic. However, its toxic effect on the heart limits its clinical application. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of glycine administration to counteract the DOXO-induction of cardiomyopathy in mice. Fifty male albino mice were divided into five groups (n\u2009=\u200910/group) as follows: control, DOXO, Gp100, Gp150, and Gp200. Histopathological examination of the heart, and biochemical examinations for heart function (creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 10 (IL-10)), oxidative stress (malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, nitric oxide (NO), and uric acid), kidney function (urea and creatinine), and minerals (calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium) were carried out. Cardiomyopathy induced by DOXO treatment (15\u00a0mg/kg total dose) was ascertained via pathological alterations seen in heart tissue and verified biochemically via increases (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in CPK, LDH, AST, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, MDA, NO, Na, and K levels along with decreases (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in GSH, SOD, catalase, and uric acid. Glycine co-treatment, using doses of 100, 150, and 200\u00a0mg/kg, in a dose-dependent manner, displayed ameliorated heart architecture, significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.001) improved biochemical heart function tests, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and controlled mineral levels. The positive actions of glycine in DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity amelioration via modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and immunity are confirmed.

This process results in a neuro-impairment like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Evidence show that MS also contributes to involvement of the autonomic system. In the molecular approach to this involvement, we aimed to observe muscarinic ACh receptor 2-3 (mAChR2-3), and inwardly rectifying potassium channel 3.1 (Kir3.1) immunoreactivities on the brainstem, vagus nerve, and heart under cuprizone model.\nWistar albino rats were randomly divided into 8 groups; duplicating 4 groups as male and female: control groups (n\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0+3), Cuprizone groups (n\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0+12), sham groups (n\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0+4), and carboxy-methyl-cellulose groups (n\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0+3).

Immunohistochemistry analysis followed to the pathologic measurement of the brainstem, vagus nerve, and heart for mAChR2, mAChR3 and Kir3.1 proteins KEY FINDINGS: A significant demyelination was observed in the hippocampus and cortex tissues of rats in the female and male cuprizone groups. Myelin basic protein immunoreactivity demonstrated that cuprizone groups, in both males and females, had down-regulation in the hippocampus and cortex areas. The weights of the cuprizone-fed rats significantly decreased over six weeks. Dilated blood vessels and neuronal degeneration were severe in the hippocampus and cortex of the cuprizone groups. In the female cuprizone group, expression of mAChR2 and mAChR2 was significantly increased in the brainstem, atrium/ventricle of heart, and left/right sections of vagus nerve. Kir3.1 channels were also up-regulated in the left vagus nerve and heart sections of the female cuprizone group SIGNIFICANCE: Especially in our data where female-based significant results were obtained reveal that demyelination may lead to significant mAChR2, mAChR3 and Kir3.1 changes in brainstem, vagus nerve, and heart.

We hypothesized that transplantation of hiPSC-CM tissue sheets with slow-release ONO-1301 scaffold could promote hostgraft angiogenesis, enhance tissue survival and therapeutic effect.\nWe developed hiPSC-CM tissue sheets with ONO-1301 slow-release scaffold and evaluated their morphology, gene expression, and effects on angiogenesis. Three tissue sheet layers were transplanted into a rat myocardial infarction (MI) model. Left ventricular ejection fraction, gene expression in the MI border zone, and angiogenesis effects were investigated 4 weeks after transplantation.\nIn vitro assessment confirmed the slow-release of ONO-1301, and its pro-angiogenesis effects. In addition, in vivo data demonstrated that ONO-1301 administration positively correlated with graft survival. Cardiac tissue as thick as \u223c900 \u03bcm was retained in the ONO (+) treated group. Additionally, left ventricular ejection fraction of the ONO (+) group was significantly enhanced, compared to ONO (-) group.

Metabolic interventions via ketogenic diets (KDs) have been used for decades to treat epilepsy, and more recently, also diabetes and obesity, as common comorbidities of heart diseases. However, recent reports linked KDs, based on long-chain triglycerides (LCTs), to cardiac fibrosis and a reduction of heart function in rodents. As intervention using medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) was recently shown to be beneficial in murine cardiac reperfusion injury, the question arises as to what extent the fatty acid (FA)-composition in a KD alters molecular markers of FA-oxidation (FAO) and modulates cardiac fibrotic outcome.\nThe effects of LCT-KD as well as an LCT/MCT mix (8:1 ketogenic ratio) on cardiac tissue integrity and the plasma metabolome were assessed in adult male C57/BL6NRJ mice after eight weeks on the respective diet.\nBoth KDs resulted in increased amount of collagen fibers and cardiac tissue was immunologically indistinguishable between groups. MCT supplementation resulted in i) profound changes in plasma metabolome, ii) reduced hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase upregulation, and mitofusin 2 downregulation, iii) abrogation of LCT-induced mitochondrial enlargement, and iv) enhanced FAO profile. Contrary to literature, mitochondrial biogenesis was unaffected by KDs. We propose that the observed tissue remodeling is caused by the accumulation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal protein adducts, despite an inconspicuous nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 pathway.\nWe conclude that regardless of the generally favorable effects of MCTs, they cannot inhibit 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal adduct formation and fibrotic tissue formation in this setting.

{"title": "Cardiomyocyte hyperplasia and immaturity but not hypertrophy are characteristic features of patients with RASopathies.", "abstract": "RASopathies are caused by mutations in genes that alter the MAP kinase pathway and are marked by several malformations with cardiovascular disorders as the predominant cause of mortality. Mechanistic insights in the underlying pathogenesis in affected cardiac tissue are rare. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of RASopathy causing mutations on the human heart.\nUsing single cell approaches and histopathology we analyzed cardiac tissue from children with different RASopathy-associated mutations compared to age-matched dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and control hearts. The volume of cardiomyocytes was reduced in RASopathy conditions compared to controls and DCM patients, and the estimated number of cardiomyocytes per heart was \u223c4-10 times higher. Single nuclei RNA sequencing of a 13-year-old RASopathy patient (carrying a PTPN11 c.1528C\u00a0>\u00a0G mutation) revealed that myocardial cell composition and transcriptional patterns were similar to <1\u00a0year old DCM hearts. Additionally, immaturity of cardiomyocytes is shown by an increased MYH6/MYH7 expression ratio and reduced expression of genes associated with fatty acid metabolism. In the patient with the PTPN11 mutation activation of the MAP kinase pathway was not evident in cardiomyocytes, whereas increased phosphorylation of PDK1 and its downstream kinase Akt was detected.\nIn conclusion, an immature cardiomyocyte differentiation status appears to be preserved in juvenile RASopathy patients. The increased mass of the heart in such patients is due to an increase in cardiomyocyte number (hyperplasia) but not an enlargement of individual cardiomyocytes (hypertrophy).", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2023-03-23", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg-DetlefDrenckhahn", "LukaNicin", "SaraAkhouaji", "SvenjaKr\u00fcck", "Anna EvaBlank", "AnneSch\u00e4nzer", "UygarY\u00f6r\u00fcker", "ChristianJux", "LukasTombor", "WesleyAbplanalp", "DavidJohn", "Andreas MZeiher", "StefanieDimmeler", "StefanRupp"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.03.003"}

{"title": "miR-16-5p Regulates Ferroptosis by Targeting SLC7A11 in Adriamycin-Induced Ferroptosis in Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Adriamycin (ADR) is commonly used in tumor chemotherapy, but its nonreversible cardiotoxicity severely hampers its clinical application. Ferroptosis is an implicated cause of ADR-induced injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study explored whether ferroptosis is a pivotal pathogenic pathway underlying ADR-induced cardiotoxicity and the possible molecular mechanisms involved.\nIn vivo and in vitro experimental models were used to study the mechanism of ADR-mediated ferroptosis. Ferroptosis levels were examined in mice and human/rat cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, the expression levels of SLC7A11 and related miRNAs were examined. Bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the potential interaction between miR-16-5p and SLC7A11. The biological functions and interaction of SLC7A11 and miR-16-5p were investigated in vivo and in vitro.\nOur study observed that ADR treatment significantly increased ferroptosis levels in vivo and in vitro. Ferroptosis-related pharmacological interventions further confirmed these results. Our data displayed that the SLC7A11 level was significantly decreased in cardiac tissues and cells, while an increased expression level of miR-16-5p was observed. Moreover, upregulation of SLC7A1 and inhibition of miR-16-5p attenuated ADR-induced cardiomyocyte ferroptosis injury. Interactive rescue experiments showed that the protective effects of miR-16-5p inhibition on ADR-induced cardiomyocyte injury were blocked by SLC7A11 knockdown.\nBased on these findings, targeting miR-16-5p could partially reverse the ADR-induced cardiotoxicity by rescuing the SLC7A11 to attenuate ferroptosis.

{"title": "Indirect epigenetic testing identifies a diagnostic signature of cardiomyocyte DNA methylation in heart failure.", "abstract": "Precision-based molecular phenotyping of heart failure must overcome limited access to cardiac tissue. Although epigenetic alterations have been found to underlie pathological cardiac gene dysregulation, the clinical utility of myocardial epigenomics remains narrow owing to limited clinical access to tissue. Therefore, the current study determined whether patient plasma confers indirect phenotypic, transcriptional, and/or epigenetic alterations to ex vivo cardiomyocytes to mirror the failing human myocardium. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and single-origin human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and were treated with blood plasma samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and donor subjects lacking history of cardiovascular disease. Following plasma treatments, NRVMs and hiPSC-CMs underwent significant hypertrophy relative to non-failing controls, as determined via automated high-content screening. Array-based DNA methylation analysis of plasma-treated hiPSC-CMs and cardiac biopsies uncovered robust, and conserved, alterations in cardiac DNA methylation, from which 100 sites were validated using an independent cohort. Among the CpG sites identified, hypo-methylation of the ATG promoter was identified as a diagnostic marker of HF, wherein cg03800765 methylation (AUC\u2009=\u20090.986, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) was found to out-perform circulating NT-proBNP levels in differentiating heart failure.

{"title": "Integrated whole-genome gene expression analysis reveals an atlas of dynamic immune landscapes after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a deadly medical condition leading to irreversible damage to the inflicted cardiac tissue. Elevated inflammatory response marks the severity of MI and is associated with the development of heart failure (HF), a long-term adverse outcome of MI. However, the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapies for MI remains controversial. Deciphering the dynamic transcriptional signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is a viable and translatable route to better understand post-MI inflammation, which may help guide post-MI anti-inflammatory treatments.\nIn this work, integrated whole-genome gene expression analysis was performed to explore dynamic immune landscapes associated with MI.\nGSEA and GSVA showed that pathways involved in the inflammatory response and metabolic reprogramming were significantly enriched in PBMCs from MI patients. Based on leukocyte profiles generated by xCell algorithm, the relative abundance of monocytes and neutrophils was significantly increased in PBMCs from MI patients and had positive correlations with typical inflammation-associated transcripts. Mfuzz clustering revealed temporal gene expression profiles of PBMCs during the 6-month post-MI follow-up. Analysis of DEGs and gene sets indicated that PBMCs from HF group were characterized by elevated and lasting expression of genes implicated in inflammation and coagulation. Consensus clustering generated 4 metabolic subtypes of PBMCs with molecular heterogeneity in HF patients.\nIn summary, integrated whole-genome gene expression analysis here outlines a transcriptomic framework that may improve the understanding of dynamic signatures present in PBMCs, as well as the heterogeneity of PBMCs in MI patients with or without long-term clinical outcome of HF. Moreover, the work here uncovers the diversity and heterogeneity of PBMCs from HF patients, providing novel bioinformatic evidence supporting the mechanistic implications of metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dysfunction in the post-MI inflammation and HF.

The present study aimed to investigate the dose-response association and determine the optimum dose of ISO to establish a high-morbidity/low-mortality SC mouse model to simulate the clinical symptoms of SC. A total of 72 6-week-old wild-type female mice (C57BL/6) were randomly divided into control mice administered normal saline and mice treated with increasing ISO concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg ISO intraperitoneal injections daily for 14 consecutive days). All mice were analysed by body weight assessment, open field test (OFT), echocardiography (Echo), electrocardiogram (ECG), assessment of myocardial pathology and quantification of cortisol, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), catecholamine (CA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Compared with the control group, the 25 and 50 mg/kg ISO groups exhibited the most prominent weight changes and lower mortality. The open-field test showed a significant decrease in autonomous activity behaviour in the 25 and 50 mg/kg ISO groups compared with the control group (P<0.05). Echo revealed that the apex of the heart was balloon-like in the 25 and 50 mg/kg ISO groups, along with prominent left ventricular dyskinesia. ECG showed a significant increase in ST segment amplitude, QT interval and Q amplitude (P<0.05) in the 25 and 50 mg/kg ISO group compared with the control group. Haematoxylin and eosin staining of heart tissue showed a disordered arrangement of myocardial cells, dissolution of myocardial fibres and cytoplasm, notable widening of myocardial cell space, oedema and hyperaemia of the interstitium, whereas heart tissue of the control group was structurally intact.

{"title": "Liraglutide Attenuates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Through the Inhibition of Necroptosis by Activating GLP-1R/PI3K/Akt Pathway.", "abstract": "Necroptosis is a crucial programmed cell death that is tightly associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI). Liraglutide is an effective option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has recently been reported to exert cardioprotective effects on MI/RI. Researchers do not know whether the cardioprotective effect of liraglutide is involved in regulating necroptosis. This study aimed to explore the effect of liraglutide on MI/RI-induced necroptosis and its potential mechanisms. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) was performed on H9c2 cells in vitro to simulate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and an MI/RI rat model was established in vivo by ligating the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. H/R or I/R damage was assessed by performing biochemical assay, Hoechst 33342/PI staining, H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) staining, and Annexin-V/PI staining. Our data revealed that liraglutide resulted in markedly increased cell viability and reduced cardiac enzyme release by protecting cardiomyocytes from a necrosis-like phenotype after H/R. The myocardial infarct size and cardiac enzyme release were reduced in the heart tissues from the liraglutide-treated group. The levels of necroptosis-associated proteins (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), p-RIPK3, and phosphorylated-mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (p-MLKL)) were also reduced by the liraglutide treatment. Mechanistically, we revealed that liraglutide exerted cardioprotective effects through a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway. Both the GLP-1R inhibitor exendin (9-39) and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the protective effects of liraglutide in vitro.

{"title": "Micropatterned fibrin scaffolds increase cardiomyocyte alignment and contractility for the fabrication of engineered myocardial tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, which can result in blockage of a coronary artery, triggering a myocardial infarction (MI), scar tissue formation in the myocardium, and ultimately heart failure. Currently, the gold-standard solution for total heart failure is a heart transplantation. An alternative to total-organ transplantation is surgically remodeling the ventricle with the implantation of a cardiac patch. Acellular cardiac patches have previously been investigated using synthetic or decellularized native materials to improve cardiac function. However, a limitation of this strategy is that acellular cardiac patches only reshape the ventricle and do not increase cardiac contractile function. Toward the development of a cardiac patch, our laboratory previously developed a cell-populated composite fibrin scaffold and aligned microthreads to recapitulate the mechanical properties of native myocardium. In this study, we explore micropatterning the surfaces of fibrin gels to mimic anisotropic native tissue architecture and promote cellular alignment of human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM), which is crucial for increasing scaffold contractile properties. hiPS-CMs seeded on micropatterned surfaces exhibit cellular elongation, distinct sarcomere alignment, and circumferential connexin-43 staining at 14\u2009days of culture, which are necessary for mature contractile properties. Constructs were also subject to electrical stimulation during culture to promote increased contractile properties.

{"title": "The alkaloids of Corydalis hendersonii Hemsl. contribute to the cardioprotective effect against ischemic injury in mice by attenuating cardiomyocyte apoptosis via p38 MAPK signaling pathway.", "abstract": "There is a characteristic Tibetan folk medicine in China named Corydalis hendersonii Hemsl. (CH) has been used for treatment of cardiovascular related diseases, called \"plethora\" in Tibetan medicine. Previous studies demonstrated that ethanol extract of CH showed anti-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) effect through inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation. Rich alkaloids fraction (RAF) is isolated from CH, but whether RAF possessing an equivalent effect with the CH ethanol extract and by which mechanism it protects against AMI has not yet reported. The paper aimed to study the potential role of RAF on myocardial injured mice and its underlying mechanism.\nLiquid chromatography mass spectrometry-ion trap-time of flight (LCMS-IT-TOF) was used to analyze the chemical profile and isolate pure compounds. The ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) of coronary artery in mice was used to evaluate the in vivo anti-AMI effect, by dividing into eight groups: Sham, Model, Fosinopril (10\u00a0mg/kg, i.g.), total extract (TE, 400\u00a0mg/kg, i.g.), poor alkaloids fraction\u00a0 (PAF,\u00a0300\u00a0mg/kg, i.g.), and RAF (25, 50, and 100\u00a0mg/kg, respectively, i.g.) groups. Echocardiography was used to evaluate mice heart function through the index of left ventricular end-systolic\u00a0 diameter (LVEDs), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF). We detected the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in the serum and the plasma level of angiotensin II (AngII). The apoptosis of mice myocardial tissue was verified by TUNEL assay. The expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK), Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were detected through immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR and western blot in mice\u00a0heart tissue and H9c2 cells.\nEchocardiography data indicated that the values of LVEDd and LVEDs were reduced and the values of FS and EF were improved by TE and RAF significantly. RAF also decreased the levels of LDH, CK-MB and AngII and significantly inhibited inflammatory cells in the marginal zone of myocardial infarction. The TUNEL assay results showed that RAF significantly attenuated cell apoptosis. Immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR assay showed that RAF inhibited p38 MAPK, Bax, and Bcl-2 proteins in mice myocardium. Western blot results validated that the expressions of key proteins were inhibited by RAF. Also, the apoptotic cells and apoptosis-related proteins were dramatically reduced by RAF in vivo and in vitro. Besides, RAF and PAF were analyzed by LCMS-IT-TOF to identify the main compounds and to demonstrate the difference between them. The results showed that a total of 14 alkaloids were identified, which indicated that the isoquinoline alkaloids were the main ingredients in RAF may contributing to the cardioprotective effect in mice.\nRAF improves cardiac function by inhibiting apoptosis via p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and RAF contributes to the effect against myocardial ischemic injury of TE in mice, which provides a substantial reference for the clinical application against ischemia heart disease and quality control of CH.", "journal": "Chinese medicine", "date": "2023-03-19", "authors": ["FuxingGe", "XiaoliGao", "XiaochunZhou", "JunjunLi", "XiaojingMa", "MeiwenHuang", "SanaWuken", "PengfeiTu", "ChaoAn", "XingyunChai"], "doi": "10.1186/s13020-023-00726-8\n10.1016/j.resp.2007.03.005\n10.1111/bph.13363\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.05.035\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154078\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.188\n10.1016/j.jep.2016.04.039\n10.1016/j.jep.2020.112893\n10.1016/j.jep.2017.06.020\n10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.09.064\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243162\n10.1136/jcp.55.11.801\n10.1007/s003950200013\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1498\n10.1186/s12906-017-1902-1\n10.1007/s10495-007-0749-1\n10.3390/molecules24183385"}
{"title": "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Modeling of Single-Ventricle Congenital Heart Diseases.", "abstract": "Congenital heart disease includes a wide variety of structural cardiac defects, the most severe of which are single ventricle defects (SVD). These patients suffer from significant morbidity and mortality; however, our understanding of the developmental etiology of these conditions is limited. Model organisms offer a window into normal and abnormal cardiogenesis yet often fail to recapitulate complex congenital heart defects seen in patients. The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with single-ventricle defects opens the door to studying SVD in patient-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) in a variety of different contexts, including organoids and chamber-specific cardiomyocytes. As the genetic and cellular causes of SVD are not well defined, patient-derived iPSC-CMs hold promise for uncovering mechanisms of disease development and serve as a platform for testing therapies. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in iPSC-based models of SVD.\nRecent advances in patient-derived iPSC-CM differentiation, as well as the development of both chamber-specific and non-myocyte cardiac cell types, make it possible to model the complex genetic and molecular architecture involved in SVD development. Moreover, iPSC models have become increasingly complex with the generation of 3D organoids and engineered cardiac tissues which open the door to new mechanistic insight into SVD development. Finally, iPSC-CMs have been used in proof-of-concept studies that the molecular underpinnings of SVD may be targetable for future therapies. While each platform has its advantages and disadvantages, the use of patient-derived iPSC-CMs offers a window into patient-specific cardiogenesis and SVD development.

However, there have been no reports linking Cav1 to diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). In the present study, we established a relationship between Cav1 and the development of DCM. We found that compared with Cav1+/+ mice, Cav1-/- diabetic mice exhibited more severe cardiac injury, increased activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, and up-regulation of downstream genes, including hypertrophic factors and inflammatory fibrosis factors in heart tissues. Additionally, in vitro results showed that knocking down Cav1 further activated HG-induced NF-\u03baB signaling, increased the expression of downstream target genes, and decreased the expression of inhibitor \u03b1 of NF-\u03baB (i\u03baB\u03b1), all of which have been linked to DCM pathogenesis. In contrast, Cav1 overexpression resulted in the opposite effects.

We aimed to optimize a canine cardiac slice culture system for exploration of cancer therapy impact on intact cardiac tissue, creating a translatable model that maintains autophagy in culture and is amenable to autophagy modulation.

Cell viability and apoptosis were quantified with MTT assay and TUNEL staining. Cardiac slices were challenged with doxorubicin and an autophagy activator (rapamycin) or inhibitor (chloroquine). Autophagic flux components (LC3, p62) were quantified by western blot. Cardiac slices retained high cell viability for >7 days in culture and basal levels of autophagic markers remained unchanged.

{"title": "Human Resistin Induces Cardiac Dysfunction in Pulmonary Hypertension.", "abstract": "Background Cardiac failure is the primary cause of death in most patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH). As pleiotropic cytokines, human resistin (Hresistin) and its rodent homolog, resistin-like molecule \u03b1, are mechanistically critical to pulmonary vascular remodeling in PH. However, it is still unclear whether activation of these resistin-like molecules can directly cause PH-associated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling. Methods and Results In this study, we detected Hresistin protein in right ventricular (RV) tissue of patients with PH and elevated resistin-like molecule expression in RV tissues of rodents with RV hypertrophy and failure.

Furthermore, CVDs are the leading cause of diminished quality of life for patients, frequently as a result of their progressive deterioration. Medical implants that release drugs into the body are active implants that do more than just provide mechanical support; they also have a therapeutic role. Primarily, this is achieved through the controlled release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) at the implementation site.\nIn this review, the authors discuss drug-eluting stents, drug-eluting vascular grafts, and drug-eluting cardiac patches with the aim of providing a broad overview of the three most common types of cardiac implant.\nDrug eluting implants are an ideal alternative to traditional drug delivery because they allow for accurate drug release, local drug delivery to the target tissue, and minimize the adverse side effects associated with systemic administration.

Human variants in filamin C (FLNC) are linked to a variety of cardiomyopathies, and in this study, we investigate an in-frame deletion (c.7416_7418delGAA, p.Glu2472_Asn2473delinAsp) in a patient with RCM. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) with this variant display impaired relaxation and reduced calcium kinetics in 2D culture when compared with a CRISPR-Cas9-corrected isogenic control line. Similarly, mutant engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) demonstrate increased passive tension and impaired relaxation velocity compared with isogenic controls.

Currently, no drug can completely reverse or inhibit the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. To this end, we proposed a silicate ion therapy based on extract derived from calcium silicate (CS) bioceramics for the treatment of angiotensin II (Ang II) induced cardiac hypertrophy.\nIn this study, the Ang II induced cardiac hypertrophy mouse model was established, and the silicate ion extract was injected to mice intravenously. The cardiac function was evaluated by using a high-resolution Vevo 3100 small animal ultrasound imaging system. Wheat germ Agglutinin, Fluo4-AM staining and immunofluorescent staining was conducted to assess the cardiac hypertrophy, intracellular calcium and angiogenesis of heart tissue, respectively.\nThe in vitro results showed that silicate ions could inhibit the cell size of cardiomyocytes, reduce cardiac hypertrophic gene expression, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC), decrease the content of intracellular calcium induced by Ang II. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed that intravenous injection of silicate ions could remarkably inhibit the cardiac hypertrophy and promote the formation of capillaries, further alleviating Ang II-induced cardiac function disorder.\nThis study demonstrated that the released silicate ions from CS possessed potential value as a novel therapeutic strategy of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which provided a new insight for clinical trials.", "journal": "Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2023-03-16", "authors": ["XinLi", "YanxinZhang", "QishuJin", "QiaoyuSong", "ChenFan", "YirenJiao", "ChenYang", "JiangChang", "ZhihongDong", "YumeiQue"], "doi": "10.1007/s13770-023-00523-2\n10.1038/s41467-022-31996-9\n10.1038/s41569-018-0007-y\n10.1016/j.jacc.2021.04.028\n10.1111/jcmm.15533\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020502\n10.1002/ejhf.1858\n10.1186/s12933-022-01573-x\n10.1002/advs.202101485\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000126\n10.1016/j.dental.2015.01.004\n10.1002/advs.201801260\n10.1039/D0TB01320J\n10.1021/acsami.8b17754\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302095\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.121\n10.1038/nature11040\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312017\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.711317\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.1.148\n10.1002/advs.202100894\n10.1002/advs.202102220\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300507\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.055841\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.02.013"}
{"title": "Effect of chronic exposure to fine particulate matter on cardiac tissue of NZBWF1 mice.", "abstract": "Epidemiological and toxicological studies have shown that inhalation of particulate matter (PM) is associated with development of cardiovascular diseases. Long-term exposure to PM may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and reduce life expectancy. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease, autoimmune in nature, that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies that affects several organs, including the heart. Air pollution - which can be caused\u00a0by several different factors - may be one of the most important points both at the onset and the natural history of SLE. Therefore this study aims to investigate whether exposure to air pollution promotes increased inflammation and cardiac remodelling in animals predisposed to SLE. Female NZBWF1 mice were exposed to an environmental particle concentrator. Aspects related to cardiac remodelling, inflammation and apoptosis were analysed in the myocardium. Body weight gain, cardiac trophism by heart/body weight ratio, relative area of cardiomyocytes and the fibrotic area of cardiac tissue were evaluated during the exposure period. Animals exposed to PM2.5 showed increased area of cardiomyocytes, and area of fibrosis; in addition, we observed an increase in IL-1 and C3 in the\u00a0cardiac tissue, demonstrating increased inflammation. We suggest that air pollution is capable of promoting cardiac remodelling and increased inflammation in animals predisposed to SLE.", "journal": "International journal of experimental pathology", "date": "2023-03-16", "authors": ["DuniaWaked", "Ana Clara BRodrigues", "Thamires MoraesSilva", "Victor YujiYariwake", "Sylvia Costa LimaFarhat", "Mariana MateraVeras"], "doi": "10.1111/iep.12473"}
{"title": "Development of direct cardiac reprogramming for clinical applications.", "abstract": "The incidence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing worldwide, and cardiac regenerative therapy has great potential as a new treatment strategy, especially for ischemic heart disease. Direct cardiac reprogramming is a promising new cardiac regenerative therapy that uses defined factors to induce transdifferentiation of endogenous cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs). In vivo reprogramming is expected to restore lost cardiac function without necessitating cardiac transplantation by converting endogenous CFs that exist abundantly in cardiac tissues directly into iCMs. Indeed, we and other groups have demonstrated that in vivo cardiac reprogramming improves cardiac contractile function and reduces scar area after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Recently, we demonstrated that in vivo cardiac reprogramming is an innovative cardiac regenerative therapy that not only regenerates the myocardium, but also reverses fibrosis by inducing the quiescence of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts, thereby improving heart failure in chronic MI. In this review, we summarize the recent progresses in in vivo cardiac reprogramming, and discuss its prospects for future clinical applications and the challenges of direct human reprogramming, which has been a longstanding issue.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2023-03-15", "authors": ["YuYamada", "TaketaroSadahiro", "MasakiIeda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.03.002"}
{"title": "Waterpipe smoke inhalation potentiates cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and autophagy in experimental hypertension.", "abstract": "Cigarette smoking worsens the health of hypertensive patients. However, less is known about the actions and underlying mechanisms of waterpipe smoke (WPS) in hypertension. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of WPS inhalation in mice made hypertensive (HT) by infusing angiotensin II for six weeks. On day 14 of the infusion of angiotensin II or vehicle (normotensive; NT), mice were exposed either to air or WPS for four consecutive weeks. Each session was 30\u00a0min/day and 5 days/week. In NT mice, WPS increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with NT air-exposed group. SBP increase was elevated in HT+WPS group versus either HT+air or NT+WPS. Similarly, the plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, 8-isoprostane and superoxide dismutase were increased in HT+WPS compared with either HT+air or NT+WPS. In the heart tissue, several markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were increased in HT+WPS group vs the controls. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in HT+WPS group was more affected than in the HT+air or HT+WPS groups. WPS inhalation in HT mice significantly increased cardiac DNA damage, cleaved caspase 3, expression of the autophagy proteins beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B, and phosphorylated nuclear factor \u03ba B, compared with the controls. Compared with HT+air mice, heart histology of WPS-exposed HT mice showed increased cardiomyocyte damage, neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration and focal fibrosis. We conclude that, in HT mice, WPS inhalation worsened hypertension, cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, apoptosis and autophagy.

Apigenin has cardioprotective properties; it may be employed as a capping and reducing agent in synthesizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This study examined the cardioprotective impact of AuNPs synthesized with apigenin (Api) in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC).\nApi-AuNPs were synthesized in a single pot without needing additional reagents for reducing gold ions or stabilizing the NPs. The cytotoxicity of Api-AuNPs on H9c2 heart cells was subsequently determined using the MTT assay. In the animal investigation, 40 male rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: control, cardiotoxicity (DOX), DOX treated with apigenin (DOX\u00a0+\u00a0Api), or DOX treated with Api-AuNPs (DOX\u00a0+\u00a0Api-AuNPs). To examine heart function, echocardiography was conducted. Blood samples were obtained to evaluate injury indicators (Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), Cardiac Troponin I (cTn-I), Alanine transaminase (ALT), and Aspartate transaminase (AST)). The heart was removed under general anesthetic, weighed, and preserved in formalin solution.

The mechanism of occurrence and development of MAC is not clear. In this study, firstly, the animal model was evaluated by echocardiography and myocardial pathological staining. The results revealed that the animal model exhibited cardiac injury consistent with clinical alterations of MAC, and the mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis remodeling, which led to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (%LVEF)\u00a0<\u00a040%. The expression of cellular senescence marker proteins (p16 and p21) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) was significantly increased in mouse myocardial tissue. Secondly, mRNA sequencing analysis of cardiac tissues revealed the key molecule GATA4, and Western blot, qPCR and immunofluorescence results showed that the expression level of GATA4 was significantly increased after METH exposure. Finally, knockdown of GATA4 expression in H9C2 cells in vitro significantly attenuated METH-induced cardiomyocyte senescence.

{"title": "Investigation of the efficacy of diosmin against organ damage caused by bendiocarb in male Wistar albino rats.", "abstract": "Bendiocarb is a carbamate insecticide, which is used more in indoor areas, especially against scorpions, spiders, flies, mosquitoes and cockroaches. Diosmin is an antioxidant flavonoid found mostly in citrus fruits. In this study, the efficacy of diosmin against the adverse effects of bendiocarb was investigated in rats. For this purpose, 60, 2-3\u00a0month-old male Wistar albino rats, weighing 150-200\u00a0g, were used. The animals were assigned to six groups, one of which was maintained for control purposes and five of which were trial groups. The control rats received only corn oil, which was used as a vehicle for diosmin administration in the trial groups. Groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were administered with 10\u00a0mg/kg.bw bendiocarb, 10\u00a0mg/kg.bw diosmin, 20\u00a0mg/kg.bw diosmin, 2\u00a0mg/kg.bw bendiocarb plus 10\u00a0mg/kg.bw diosmin, and 2\u00a0mg/kg.bw bendiocarb plus 20\u00a0mg/kg.bw diosmin, respectively, using an oral catheter, for 28\u00a0days. At the end of the study period, blood and organ (liver, kidneys, brain, testes, heart and lungs) samples were collected. Body weight and organ weights were determined. Compared to the control group, in the group given bendiocarb alone, firstly, body weight and liver, lung and testicular weights decreased. Secondly, tissue/plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels increased, and glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (except for lung tissue), glutathione reductase (GR), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities decreased in all\u00a0tissues and erythrocytes. Thirdly, catalase (CAT) activity decreased in erythrocytes and the kidney, brain, heart and lung tissues and increased in the liver and testes. Fourthly, while GST activity decreased in the kidneys, testes, lung and erythrocytes, an increase was observed in the liver and heart tissues. Fifthly, while serum triglyceride levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and pseudo-cholinesterase (PchE) activities decreased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and uric acid levels increased. Lastly, liver caspase 3, caspase 9 and p53 expression levels significantly increased. When compared to the control group, the groups treated with diosmin alone showed no significant difference for the parameters investigated. On the other hand, it was observed that the values of the groups treated with a combination of bendiocarb and diosmin were closer to the values of the control group. In conclusion, while exposure to bendiocarb at a dose of 2\u00a0mg/kg.bw for 28\u00a0days caused oxidative stress/organ damage, diosmin administration at doses of 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg.bw reduced this damage. This demonstrated that diosmin has pharmaceutical benefits, when used for supportive treatment as well as radical treatment, against the potential adverse effects of bendiocarb.", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "date": "2023-03-12", "authors": ["OrhanBahar", "G\u00f6khanEraslan"], "doi": "10.1007/s11356-023-26105-2\n10.1007/s11356-019-07260-x\n10.1111/jfbc.12966\n10.1016/j.cbi.2012.10.027\n10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.04.030\n10.1002/jnr.20281\n10.1007/s00726-003-0018-8\n10.1016/j.etap.2016.11.018\n10.1371/journal.pone.0122417\n10.1177/0748233712462465\n10.1016/j.ijheh.2011.09.006\n10.1016/j.dci.2015.10.008\n10.1007/s00210-019-01758-4\n10.2174/138955713804999775\n10.3390/ijms23094523\n10.1016/s0076-6879(85)13062-4\n10.1002/ps.2780120608\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.02.028\n10.1016/0006-2952(93)90056-3\n10.1177/0748233712468020\n10.1007/s11356-019-06660-3\n10.1016/j.fct.2008.10.013\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2008.06.008\n10.1007/s11356-017-0232-7\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.187\n10.1016/s0162-0134(02)00511-1\n10.1007/s13318-021-00731-y\n10.3109/10715762.2010.498477\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)42083-8\n10.1152/ajpheart.00721.2012\n10.1016/0147-6513(84)90015-0\n10.1007/978-3-319-19096-9_13\n10.1080/03601234.2014.911593\n10.3390/biomedicines10051076\n10.1016/j.bjp.2018.04.002\n10.1002/tox.22909\n10.1007/s40495-016-0063-0\n10.1177/0960327110388959\n10.1016/j.emc.2014.09.010\n10.1093/jme/tjx032\n10.1080/10934529.2012.672136\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.08.580\n10.1186/s13028-018-0412-6,10.1186/s13028-018-0412-6\n10.1089/ars.2010.3644\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)52451-6\n10.1111/j.1365-2915.1991.tb00546.x\n10.1016/B978-0-12-395630-9.50158-4\n10.17179/excli2018-1710\n10.2165/00003495-200363010-00005\n10.1016/j.yrtph.2020.104622\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2008.01.018\n10.1002/tox.21798\n10.1100/tsw.2006.38\n10.1021/ac60149a611\n10.1007/s11356-019-06572-2\n10.1016/j.taap.2013.01.025\n10.1039/c4fo00007b\n10.1177/0748233711399311\n10.1016/S0022-2275(20)40690-X\n10.3109/01480540903130708\n10.1002/tox.21887\n10.1021/np9904509\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.04.040\n10.1007/s12012-017-9422-2\n10.1007/s12033-007-0046-9\n10.1016/j.fct.2007.06.007\n10.1093/jme/tjx047\n10.3109/01480549909017844\n10.1017/S0007114512005752\n10.1016/j.ajem.2009.01.035\n10.31838/ijprt/10.02.04\n10.1089/ars.2007.9.49\n10.1016/0003-2697(68)90092-4\n10.3390/molecules25225431\n10.2116/analsci.22.1351\n10.1042/0264-6021:3600001\n10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00819.x\n10.1016/j.taap.2003.07.011\n10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.003\n10.1016/j.tox.2018.08.017\n10.1155/2022/5563759\n10.1016/0009-8981(79)90211-0\n10.1016/j.alcohol.2012.12.010\n10.1038/s41422-019-0164-5\n10.1016/j.cbi.2005.12.009\n10.1016/0300-483x(92)90101-j\n10.3181/00379727-216-44169,10.3181/00379727-216-44169\n10.1016/j.bjid.2014.02.003\n10.1016/0002-9378(79)90708-7\n10.1530/JOE-16-0004\n10.3390/antiox7050066"}
{"title": "Progress in Biomaterials for Cardiac Tissue Engineering and Regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading global causes of morbidity and mortality, posing considerable health and economic burden on patients and medical systems worldwide. This phenomenon is attributed to two main motives: poor regeneration capacity of adult cardiac tissues and insufficient therapeutic options. Thus, the context calls for upgrading treatments to deliver better outcomes. In this respect, recent research has approached the topic from an interdisciplinary perspective. Combining the advances encountered in chemistry, biology, material science, medicine, and nanotechnology, performant biomaterial-based structures have been created to carry different cells and bioactive molecules for repairing and restoring heart tissues. In this regard, this paper aims to present the advantages of biomaterial-based approaches for cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration, focusing on four main strategies: cardiac patches, injectable hydrogels, extracellular vesicles, and scaffolds and reviewing the most recent developments in these fields.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2023-03-12", "authors": ["AlexandruScafa Udri\u0219te", "Adelina-GabrielaNiculescu", "Lumini\u021baIliu\u021b\u0103", "TeodorBajeu", "AdrianaGeorgescu", "Alexandru MihaiGrumezescu", "ElisabetaB\u0103dil\u0103"], "doi": "10.3390/polym15051177\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2022.111336\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2020.08.005\n10.3390/cells10050990\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.06.001\n10.1002/ehf2.13144\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112584\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01046.x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121382\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.134\n10.4070/kcj.2021.0291\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.802551\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.009\n10.1016/j.cjca.2014.08.027\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.554597\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.08.031\n10.1016/J.ENG.2016.01.028\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00291\n10.1016/j.mser.2007.08.001\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034004\n10.3390/ijms20225760\n10.1155/2016/4285938\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310599\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2019.07.093\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2017.03.002\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.06.040\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.11.008\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.11.004\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2021.07.016\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2009.07.172\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.04.150\n10.1016/j.cjca.2018.07.128\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31829f753d\n10.1007/s00018-019-03019-2\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111425\n10.3390/ijms231810314\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102862\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9683\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.03.003\n10.1186/s13036-019-0185-0\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.104285\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2021.07.001\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.05.023\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.04.018\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2022.111332\n10.1016/j.jmst.2021.03.062\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.09.013\n10.1002/adfm.201800618\n10.1021/acsami.8b18844\n10.1126/sciadv.abb5067\n10.1007/s13239-019-00451-0\n10.1002/bit.27743\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.12.011\n10.1002/term.2392\n10.1021/acsami.9b06453\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.120266\n10.7150/thno.29552\n10.1021/acsami.8b13571\n10.3390/gels7010007\n10.1002/mabi.201800079\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00251\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2022.111641\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.2c00179\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2019.07.012\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz5380\n10.1155/2019/6708435\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.016\n10.1021/acsami.6b04911\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121849\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.12.019\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.12.025\n10.1038/s41420-020-00305-y\n10.1074/mcp.M115.055731\n10.2174/1574888X15666200309143924\n10.3390/ijms20133272\n10.7150/thno.32637\n10.1155/2017/4150705\n10.1039/C9BM00101H\n10.1093/cvr/cvy067\n10.1038/s41551-018-0229-7\n10.1016/j.bprint.2022.e00221\n10.1002/pat.4602\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121008\n10.1039/D0TB00768D\n10.1038/s41598-018-33144-0\n10.1016/j.healun.2016.01.012\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.08.005\n10.1038/s41569-021-00603-7\n10.1080/10667857.2018.1456616\n10.1038/s41578-020-00235-2\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.12.033\n10.3389/fmats.2021.804134\n10.1007/s10439-022-03037-5\n10.1002/adma.202102703\n10.3390/jcm11082265\n10.1016/j.jchf.2022.06.011\n10.1007/s40778-022-00216-x\n10.1016/j.nantod.2022.101453\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01422\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00955\n10.1002/adma.201904598\n10.1080/00914037.2020.1760271\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03182\n10.1177/08853282211063289\n10.1002/adma.201706442\n10.2147/IJN.S250872\n10.3390/ijms23031404\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2022.02.009\n10.1016/j.mee.2018.11.001\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103813\n10.1038/s41378-021-00245-2\n10.3390/ijms22042011\n10.1039/D2TB02287G\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121336\n10.1088/1758-5090/ac975d\n10.1016/j.bios.2022.114840\n10.1126/sciadv.abq6720"}

Many different HCM-associated TPM1 mutations have been identified but they vary in their degrees of severity, prevalence, and rate of disease progression.

Our objective was to employ a computational modeling pipeline to assess pathogenicity of one such variant of unknown significance, TPM1 S215L, and validate predictions using experimental methods. Molecular dynamic simulations of tropomyosin on actin suggest that the S215L significantly destabilizes the blocked regulatory state while increasing flexibility of the tropomyosin chain.

{"title": "cMyBP-C ablation in human engineered cardiac tissue causes progressive Ca2+-handling abnormalities.", "abstract": "Truncation mutations in cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) are common causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Heterozygous carriers present with classical HCM, while homozygous carriers present with early onset HCM that rapidly progress to heart failure. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce heterozygous (cMyBP-C+/-) and homozygous (cMyBP-C-/-) frame-shift mutations into MYBPC3 in human iPSCs. Cardiomyocytes derived from these isogenic lines were used to generate cardiac micropatterns and engineered cardiac tissue constructs (ECTs) that were characterized for contractile function, Ca2+-handling, and Ca2+-sensitivity. While heterozygous frame shifts did not alter cMyBP-C protein levels in 2-D cardiomyocytes, cMyBP-C+/- ECTs were haploinsufficient. cMyBP-C-/- cardiac micropatterns produced increased strain with normal Ca2+-handling. After 2 wk of culture in ECT, contractile function was similar between the three genotypes; however, Ca2+-release was slower in the setting of reduced or absent cMyBP-C. At 6 wk in ECT culture, the Ca2+-handling abnormalities became more pronounced in both cMyBP-C+/- and cMyBP-C-/- ECTs, and force production became severely depressed in cMyBP-C-/- ECTs. RNA-seq analysis revealed enrichment of differentially expressed hypertrophic, sarcomeric, Ca2+-handling, and metabolic genes in cMyBP-C+/- and cMyBP-C-/- ECTs. Our data suggest a progressive phenotype caused by cMyBP-C haploinsufficiency and ablation that initially is hypercontractile, but progresses to hypocontractility with impaired relaxation. The severity of the phenotype correlates with the amount of cMyBP-C present, with more severe earlier phenotypes observed in cMyBP-C-/- than cMyBP-C+/- ECTs. We propose that while the primary effect of cMyBP-C haploinsufficiency or ablation may relate to myosin crossbridge orientation, the observed contractile phenotype is Ca2+-mediated.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2023-03-10", "authors": ["Willem JDe Lange", "Emily TFarrell", "Jonathan JHernandez", "AlanaStempien", "Caroline RKreitzer", "Derek RJacobs", "Dominique LPetty", "Richard LMoss", "Wendy CCrone", "J CarterRalphe"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.202213204\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.11.040\n10.1038/s41467-019-10555-9\n10.7554/eLife.24634\n10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201190\n10.1073/pnas.1809540115\n10.1007/s11340-014-9874-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.00913.2013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.11.018\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.11.014\n10.1074/jbc.M113.474346\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.025\n10.1002/0471142905.hg2103s87\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315305\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.10.003\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.009\n10.1093/cvr/cvp247\n10.1085/jgp.201010448\n10.1152/ajpheart.00929.2012\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.183897\n10.1074/jbc.M116.754127\n10.1111/jcmm.12356\n10.1152/ajpheart.00941.2020\n10.1085/jgp.201210837\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.242354\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1093/nar/30.1.207\n10.1016/0076-6879(88)57093-3\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00414\n10.1136/jmedgenet-2021-107774\n10.1371/journal.pone.0153901\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00317.x\n10.1085/jgp.202012782\n10.1007/s00424-018-2226-9\n10.1085/jgp.80.2.279\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.01.005\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)00727-9\n10.1016/j.bpj.2017.05.027\n10.1161/01.RES.0000012222.70819.64\n10.1073/pnas.1518891113\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.231670\n10.1161/01.RES.0000149299.34793.3c\n10.7326/M18-3016\n10.1172/jci.insight.133782\n10.1161/01.RES.0000222059.54917.ef\n10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.064\n10.1073/pnas.1816480116\n10.1186/1471-2105-15-182\n10.1002/0470857897.ch8\n10.1073/pnas.1614020114\n10.1016/j.jsb.2010.12.003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000096363.85588.9A\n10.3389/fphys.2019.00239\n10.1161/01.RES.86.1.51\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.275602\n10.1186/1471-2105-12-323\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1161/JAHA.118.009627\n10.1097/00001573-200205000-00006\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1998.tb00871.x\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.09.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.202440\n10.1161/01.RES.88.4.383\n10.1172/JCI7377\n10.1371/journal.pone.0180064\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.009\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00830\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2008.08.003\n10.1023/A:1005513312939\n10.1038/nmeth.2840\n10.1073/pnas.1316001111\n10.1038/nsmb.3408\n10.1002/bit.27582\n10.14814/phy2.15045\n10.1007/s11340-019-00473-8\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.12.003\n10.1155/2016/1684792\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31792-X\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.111.960831\n10.1371/journal.pone.0051499\n10.1152/ajpheart.00800.2011\n10.1073/pnas.1522236113\n10.1016/j.omtn.2017.05.008\n10.1038/nprot.2013.143\n10.1074/jbc.M606949200\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btf877\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000066323.15244.54\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.002081\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.01.004\n10.1007/s00392-017-1155-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034624\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223834\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.01.019\n10.1085/jgp.202012640\n10.1074/jbc.M808850200\n10.1152/ajpheart.00686.2017\n10.1161/01.RES.0000219863.94390.ce\n10.1529/biophysj.105.078147\n10.1161/01.RES.0000245191.34690.66\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.153650\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.12.004\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.07.011\n10.1073/pnas.95.24.14406\n10.1161/JAHA.114.001263\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042339\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.177683\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001585\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067389\n10.1007/s12551-017-0274-6\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.838672\n10.1073/pnas.2025030118\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.201251\n10.1242/jcs.115.17.3517\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz326\n10.1002/ajmg.a.31981\n10.1111/febs.14702\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.1136/hrt.2007.127241\n10.1007/s11897-021-00523-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273144\n10.1038/s41467-019-09831-5\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042"}

We hypothesize that PNC mislocalization and subsequent circulation is an early event in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and therefore circulating PNC is an early biomarker of heart failure. Methods and Results In collaboration with the Duke University Clinical and Translational Science Institute's MURDOCK (Measurement to Understand Reclassification of Disease of Cabarrus and Kannapolis) study, we queried enrolled individuals and sampled 2 matched cohorts: a cohort of individuals with no known heart failure at the time of serum collection and no heart failure development in the following 13\u2009years (n=289, cohort A) and a matching cohort of enrolled individuals who had no known heart failure at the time of serum collection but subsequently developed heart failure within the following 13\u2009years (n=307, cohort B). Serum PNC and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide) concentrations in each population were quantified by ELISA.

{"title": "The role of histone deacetylases in cardiac energy metabolism in heart diseases.", "abstract": "Heart diseases are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The underlying mechanisms and pathological changes associated with cardiac diseases are exceptionally complex. Highly active cardiomyocytes require sufficient energy metabolism to maintain their function. Under physiological conditions, the choice of fuel is a delicate process that depends on the whole body and organs to support the normal function of heart tissues. However, disordered cardiac metabolism has been discovered to play a key role in many forms of heart diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and cardiac injury induced by diabetes or sepsis. Regulation of cardiac metabolism has recently emerged as a novel approach to treat heart diseases. However, little is known about cardiac energy metabolic regulators. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), a class of epigenetic regulatory enzymes, are involved in the pathogenesis of heart diseases, as reported in previous studies. Notably, the effects of HDACs on cardiac energy metabolism are gradually being explored. Our knowledge in this respect would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for heart diseases. The present review is based on the synthesis of our current knowledge concerning the role of HDAC regulation in cardiac energy metabolism in heart diseases. In addition, the role of HDACs in different models is discussed through the examples of myocardial ischemia, ischemia/reperfusion, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and diabetes- or sepsis-induced cardiac injury. Finally, we discuss the application of HDAC inhibitors in heart diseases and further prospects, thus providing insights into new treatment possibilities for different heart diseases.", "journal": "Metabolism: clinical and experimental", "date": "2023-03-09", "authors": ["QingwenYu", "GuangyuanZhao", "JingjingLiu", "YajiePeng", "XueliXu", "FeiZhao", "YangyangShi", "ChengyunJin", "JiZhang", "BoWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.metabol.2023.155532"}

{"title": "Molecular epidemiology of Bartonella quintana endocarditis in patients from Israel and Eastern Africa.", "abstract": "Bartonella quintana is an important cause of culture-negative endocarditis. Although humans have been considered as its only reservoir, recent studies showed that macaque species are also reservoirs of B. quintana. Based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) B. quintana strains have been classified into 22 sequence types (STs), with 7 STs exclusively found in humans. Data regarding the molecular epidemiology of B. quintana endocarditis is limited to only 3 STs identified in 4 patients from Europe and Australia. We studied B. quintana endocarditis acquired in Eastern Africa or Israel to investigate the genetic diversity and clinical relatedness of B. quintana from distinct geographic regions.\nEleven patients with B. quintana endocarditis, 6 from Eastern Africa and 5 from Israel, were studied. DNA was extracted from cardiac tissue or blood specimens and analyzed by MLST based on 9 genetic loci. An evolutionary relationship between STs was visualized by a minimum spanning tree. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the concatenated sequences (4271\u00a0bp) of the 9 loci using the maximum-likelihood method.\nSix strains were classified into previously described STs while 5 strains were identified for the first time and classified into new STs 23-27 which clustered with the previously reported STs 1-7 from human strains found in Australia, France, Germany, the USA, Russia, and the former Yugoslavia, without indication of geographical structuring. ST2 was the most prevalent ST, found in 5 of 15 patients with endocarditis (33.3%). ST26 appears to be a primary founder of the human lineage.\nThe new and previously reported human STs form a single human lineage, clearly separated from the other 3 B. quintana lineages of cynomolgus, rhesus, and Japanese macaques. From evolutionary perspectives, these findings support the assumption that B. quintana has co-evolved with host species to form a host-speciation pattern. ST26 is suggested herein as a primary founder of the human lineage and may be key to explore where B. quintana had first originated; ST2 is a dominant genetic type associated with B. quintana endocarditis.

{"title": "Dynamic interplay between RPL3- and RPL3L-containing ribosomes modulates mitochondrial activity in the mammalian heart.", "abstract": "The existence of naturally occurring ribosome heterogeneity is now a well-acknowledged phenomenon. However, whether this heterogeneity leads to functionally diverse 'specialized ribosomes' is still a controversial topic. Here, we explore the biological function of RPL3L (uL3L), a ribosomal protein (RP) paralogue of RPL3 (uL3) that is exclusively expressed in skeletal\u00a0muscle and heart tissues, by generating a viable homozygous Rpl3l knockout mouse strain. We identify a rescue mechanism in which, upon RPL3L depletion, RPL3 becomes up-regulated, yielding RPL3-containing ribosomes instead of RPL3L-containing ribosomes that are typically found in cardiomyocytes. Using both ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and a novel orthogonal approach consisting of ribosome pulldown coupled to nanopore sequencing (Nano-TRAP), we find that RPL3L modulates neither translational efficiency nor ribosome affinity towards a specific subset of transcripts. In contrast, we show that depletion of RPL3L leads to increased ribosome-mitochondria interactions in cardiomyocytes, which is accompanied by a significant increase in ATP levels, potentially as a result of fine-tuning of mitochondrial activity. Our results demonstrate that the existence of tissue-specific RP paralogues does not necessarily lead to enhanced translation of specific transcripts or modulation of translational output. Instead, we reveal a complex cellular scenario in which RPL3L modulates the expression of RPL3, which in turn affects ribosomal subcellular localization and, ultimately, mitochondrial activity.\nRibosomes are macromolecular machines responsible for protein synthesis in all living beings. Recent studies have shown that ribosomes can be heterogeneous in their structure, possibly leading to a specialized function. Here, we focus on RPL3L, a ribosomal protein expressed exclusively in striated muscles. We find that the deletion of the Rpl3l gene in a mouse model triggers a compensation mechanism, in which the missing RPL3L protein is replaced by its paralogue, RPL3. Furthermore, we find that RPL3-containing ribosomes establish closer interactions with mitochondria, cellular organelles responsible for energy production, leading to higher energy production when compared with RPL3L-containing ribosomes. Finally, we show that the RPL3\u2013RPL3L compensation mechanism is also triggered in heart disease conditions, such as hypertrophy and myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Nucleic acids research", "date": "2023-03-08", "authors": ["IvanMilenkovic", "Helaine GrazieleSantos Vieira", "Morghan CLucas", "JorgeRuiz-Orera", "GianninoPatone", "ScottKesteven", "JianxinWu", "MichaelFeneley", "GuadalupeEspadas", "EduardSabid\u00f3", "NorbertH\u00fcbner", "Sebastiaanvan Heesch", "MirkoV\u00f6lkers", "Eva MariaNovoa"], "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkad121\n10.17504/protocols.io.veae3ae"}

Ninety male SD rats were randomly divided into a sham group, a model group, CRFG low and high-dose(0.5 and 1.0 g\u00b7kg~(-1)) groups, and CCFG low and high-dose(0.5 and 1.0 g\u00b7kg~(-1)) groups, with 15 rats in each group. The sham group and the model group were given equal volumes of normal saline by gavage. Before modeling, the drug was given by gavage once a day for 7 consecutive days. One hour after the last administration, the MI/RI rat model was established by ligating the left anterior descending artery(LAD) for 30 min ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion except the sham group. The sham group underwent the same procedures without LAD ligation. Heart function, cardiac infarct size, cardiac patho-logy, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac injury enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines were determined to assess the protective effects of CRFG and CCFG against MI/RI. The gene expression levels of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain protein 3(NLRP3) inflammasome, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD(ASC), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1(caspase-1), Gasdermin-D(GSDMD), interleukin-1\u03b2(IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-18(IL-18) were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). The protein expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, and N-GSDMD were determined by Western blot. The results showed that both CRFG and CCFG pretreatments significantly improved cardiac function, decreased the cardiac infarct size, inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and reduced the content of lactic dehydrogenase(LDH), creatine kinase MB isoenzyme(CK-MB), aspartate transaminase(AST), and cardiac troponin \u2160(cTn\u2160). In addition, CRFG and CCFG pretreatments significantly decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) in serum. RT-PCR results showed that CRFG and CCFG pretreatment down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, and downstream pyroptosis-related effector substances including GSDMD, IL-18, and IL-1\u03b2 in cardiac tissues. Western blot revealed that CRFG and CCFG pretreatments significantly decreased the protein expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, and N-GSDMD in cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Potential clinical biomarkers and perspectives in diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a serious cardiovascular complication and the leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Patients typically do not experience any symptoms and have normal systolic and diastolic cardiac functions in the early stages of DCM. Because the majority of cardiac tissue has already been destroyed by the time DCM is detected, research must be conducted on biomarkers for early DCM, early diagnosis of DCM patients, and early symptomatic management to minimize mortality rates among DCM patients. Most of the existing implemented clinical markers are not very specific for DCM, especially in the early stages of DCM. Recent studies have shown that a number of new novel markers, such as galactin-3 (Gal-3), adiponectin (APN), and irisin, have significant changes in the clinical course of the various stages of DCM, suggesting that we may have a positive effect on the identification of DCM. As a summary of the current state of knowledge regarding DCM biomarkers, this review aims to inspire new ideas for identifying clinical markers and related pathophysiologic mechanisms that could be used in the early diagnosis and treatment of DCM.", "journal": "Diabetology & metabolic syndrome", "date": "2023-03-05", "authors": ["JianxinDeng", "FangYan", "JinglunTian", "AijunQiao", "DewenYan"], "doi": "10.1186/s13098-023-00998-y\n10.1177/2042018819834869\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehm037\n10.1016/0002-9149(74)90089-7\n10.2337/diacare.28.3.612\n10.2337/diacare.24.9.1614\n10.2337/diacare.27.3.699\n10.1007/s10741-012-9313-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.679597\n10.1007/s00125-012-2579-0\n10.2337/diacare.27.8.1879\n10.2174/1871530311313010006\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.19.2271\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.22.2668\n10.1155/2017/8637138\n10.7150/ijms.14141\n10.3892/etm.2014.1539\n10.1124/jpet.118.254029\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.106.079509\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.03.013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.03.808\n10.1038/nm1137\n10.3389/fcell.2021.644160\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.03.007\n10.1590/s0102-865020200010000007\n10.1155/2016/4219735\n10.1038/nature10777\n10.1016/j.gene.2020.145209\n10.1016/j.peptides.2022.170774\n10.1002/cbin.11441\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.013\n10.1002/ehf2.12722\n10.1111/1751-2980.12126\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.08.018\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.2012.05726.x\n10.1096/fj.201902692R\n10.1002/cbin.11079\n10.23736/S0391-1977.19.03114-6\n10.1007/s13300-020-00802-4\n10.1002/mnfr.202000231\n10.1093/cvr/cvt173\n10.1186/1475-2840-12-150\n10.1007/s10557-017-6725-2\n10.7150/ijbs.29680\n10.1038/s41401-020-0490-7\n10.1111/jcmm.13743\n10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107728\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.698698\n10.1002/ptr.6448\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104771\n10.1007/s10557-013-6498-1\n10.1093/rheumatology/keab277\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.06.020\n10.1055/a-0983-1673\n10.1111/1753-0407.12991\n10.1253/circj.CJ-19-1182\n10.3390/ijms20061492\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022281\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016239\n10.1006/bbrc.1998.9578\n10.1136/hrt.2009.191122\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.000077\n10.1161/01.RES.0000033522.37861.69\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.134619\n10.1152/ajpheart.00046.2008\n10.1517/14728220903485685\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.06.013\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.08916\n10.1530/JOE-20-0398\n10.1152/ajpheart.00821.2013\n10.1038/ijo.2014.122\n10.1111/acel.12538\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00256\n10.1371/journal.pone.0071041\n10.1111/jcmm.12453\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e32834347de\n10.1002/dmrr.2997\n10.3389/fphys.2020.583570\n10.1042/BSR20200040\n10.1186/s12872-015-0068-3\n10.1007/s12020-009-9243-6\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.07.003\n10.1007/s00059-013-3779-1\n10.3390/biomedicines8020029\n10.5650/jos.ess21251\n10.1186/s12944-018-0872-8\n10.7150/thno.22196\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306565\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05876\n10.1016/j.pbj.0000000000000023\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.190512\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.12.103\n10.1155/2021/9589185\n10.1186/s12872-016-0437-6\n10.1016/j.cca.2013.12.017\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.04.053\n10.1161/JAHA.118.011100\n10.1016/j.echo.2012.10.008\n10.1161/JAHA.115.002347\n10.1007/s12265-020-09965-8\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110071\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00200\n10.1152/ajpheart.00609.2018\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.868372\n10.1073/pnas.92.4.1142\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3932\n10.4239/wjd.v12.i6.685\n10.2174/092986713804806702\n10.1093/cvr/cvr202\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e32835ca903\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq400\n10.1093/cvr/cvs234\n10.1152/ajpheart.01041.2010\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.05.013\n10.1097/XCE.0000000000000240\n10.1097/MD.0000000000001218\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01576-5\n10.1080/14767058.2017.1300651\n10.1007/s00125-012-2822-8\n10.1006/cyto.1997.0241\n10.2337/dc11-0469\n10.1016/j.nbd.2011.04.005\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.11.014\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01936.x\n10.1055/s-2003-41306\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.10.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00663.2011\n10.2337/diabetes.50.6.1414\n10.1080/15438600490424514\n10.1152/ajpheart.00956.2015\n10.2337/dc09-0552\n10.1186/1824-7288-38-39\n10.1155/2017/1092015\n10.1002/dmrr.1038\n10.1186/s12933-015-0288-y\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111410\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.643585\n10.1074/jbc.M116.754481\n10.1016/j.diabres.2010.01.004\n10.1007/s00395-008-0715-2\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328337fe42"}

{"title": "Investigating the effect of myricetin against arsenic-induced cardiac toxicity in rats.", "abstract": "Arsenic intoxication is a serious health hazard worldwide. Its toxicity is associated with several disorders and health problems in humans. Recent studies revealed that myricetin has various biological effects, including anti-oxidation. The aim of this study is to investigate the protective effect of myricetin against arsenic-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats were randomized to one of the following groups: control, myricetin (2\u00a0mg/kg), arsenic (5\u00a0mg/kg), myricetin (1\u00a0mg/kg)\u00a0+\u00a0arsenic, and myricetin (2\u00a0mg/kg)\u00a0+\u00a0arsenic. Myricetin was given intraperitoneally 30\u00a0min before arsenic administration (5\u00a0mg/kg for 10\u00a0days). After treatments, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total thiol molecules (TTM) were determined in serum samples and cardiac tissues. Also, histological changes in cardiac tissue were evaluated. Myricetin pretreatment inhibited arsenic-induced increase in LDH, AST, CK-MB, and LPO levels. Pretreatment with myricetin also enhanced the decreased TAC and TTM levels. In addition, myricetin improved histopathological alterations in arsenic-treated rats. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with myricetin prevented arsenic-induced cardiac toxicity at least in part by decreasing oxidative stress and restoring the antioxidant system.", "journal": "Toxicology research", "date": "2023-03-04", "authors": ["AzadehAminzadeh", "Mohammad HosseinDarijani", "HamidehBashiri"], "doi": "10.1093/toxres/tfad003"}
{"title": "Affimers targeting proteins in the cardiomyocyte Z-disc: Novel tools that improve imaging of heart tissue.", "abstract": "Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a common form of heart failure. Determining how this disease affects the structure and organization of cardiomyocytes in the human heart is important in understanding how the heart becomes less effective at contraction. Here we isolated and characterised Affimers (small non-antibody binding proteins) to Z-disc proteins ACTN2 (\u03b1-actinin-2), ZASP (also known as LIM domain binding protein 3 or LDB3) and the N-terminal region of the giant protein titin (TTN Z1-Z2). These proteins are known to localise in both the sarcomere Z-discs and the transitional junctions, found close to the intercalated discs that connect adjacent cardiomyocytes. We use cryosections of left ventricles from two patients diagnosed with end-stage Dilated Cardiomyopathy who underwent Orthotopic Heart Transplantation and were whole genome sequenced. We describe how Affimers substantially improve the resolution achieved by confocal and STED microscopy compared to conventional antibodies. We quantified the expression of ACTN2, ZASP and TTN proteins in two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and compared them with a sex- and age-matched healthy donor. The small size of the Affimer reagents, combined with a small linkage error (the distance from the epitope to the dye label covalently bound to the Affimer) revealed new structural details in Z-discs and intercalated discs in the failing samples.

{"title": "Plasma extracellular vesicle transcriptome as a dynamic liquid biopsy in acute heart failure.", "abstract": "Acute decompensation is associated with increased mortality in heart failure (HF) patients, though the underlying etiology remains unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo may mark specific cardiovascular physiologic states. We hypothesized that EV transcriptomic cargo, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs, is dynamic from the decompensated to recompensated HF state, reflecting molecular pathways relevant to adverse remodeling.\nWe examined differential RNA expression from circulating plasma extracellular RNA in acute HF patients at hospital admission and discharge alongside healthy controls. We leveraged different exRNA carrier isolation methods, publicly available tissue banks, and single nuclear deconvolution of human cardiac tissue to identify cell and compartment specificity of the topmost significantly differentially expressed targets. EV-derived transcript fragments were prioritized by fold change (-1.5 to + 1.5) and significance (<5% false discovery rate), and their expression in EVs was subsequently validated in 182 additional patients (24 control; 86 HFpEF; 72 HFrEF) by qRT-PCR. We finally examined the regulation of EV-derived lncRNA transcripts in human cardiac cellular stress models.\nWe identified 138 lncRNAs and 147 mRNAs (present mostly as fragments in EVs) differentially expressed between HF and control. Differentially expressed transcripts between HFrEF vs. control were primarily cardiomyocyte derived, while those between HFpEF vs. control originated from multiple organs and different (non-cardiomyocyte) cell types within the myocardium. We validated 5 lncRNAs and 6 mRNAs to differentiate between HF and control. Of those, 4 lncRNAs (AC092656.1, lnc-CALML5-7, LINC00989, RMRP) were altered by decongestion, with their levels independent of weight changes during hospitalization. Further, these 4 lncRNAs dynamically responded to stress in cardiomyocytes and pericytes \nCirculating EV transcriptome is significantly altered during acute HF, with distinct cell and organ specificity in HFpEF vs. HFrEF consistent with a multi-organ vs. cardiac origin, respectively. Plasma EV-derived lncRNA fragments were more dynamically regulated with acute HF therapy independent of weight change (relative to mRNAs).

This research aimed to investigate the effect of coadministration of gallic acid and the GSK650394 (as SGK1 gene inhibitor) on the ischemic complications of a rat model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.\nSixty male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups with or without pretreatment with gallic acid for 10 days. After that, the heart was isolated and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution. A 30 min of ischemia was performed followed by a 60 min reperfusion. In 2 groups, GSK650394 was infused 5 min before ischemia induction. Ten minutes after reperfusion commencement, cardiac marker enzyme (CK-MB, LDH, and cTn-I) activities were measured in the cardiac perfusate. At the end of reperfusion, the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes (Catalase, Superoxide dismutase, and Glutathione peroxidase), lipid peroxidation (MDA), total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), infarct size, and SGK1 gene expression were measured in the heart tissue.\nThe results indicated that dual therapy with both drugs significantly improved endogenous anti-oxidant enzyme activity and TAC more than each drug alone. However, the heart marker enzymes (CK-MB, LDH, and cTn-I), MDA, ROS, infarct size, and SGK1 gene expression were reduced significantly compared with the ischemic group.\nThe results of this study suggest that concomitant administration of both drugs in the case of cardiac I/R injury may have a more beneficial effect than each one alone.", "journal": "Iranian journal of basic medical sciences", "date": "2023-03-04", "authors": ["FaramarzSouri", "MohammadBadavi", "MahinDianat", "Seyed AliMard", "AlirezaSarkaki"], "doi": "10.22038/IJBMS.2023.68045.14874"}
{"title": "The role of pericardial fluid biomarkers in predicting post-operative atrial fibrillation, a comprehensive review of current literature.", "abstract": "Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication of cardiac surgery which is associated with longer hospital stay, diminished quality of life, and increased mortality. Yet, the pathophysiology of POAF is poorly understood and it is unclear which patients are at highest risk. Pericardial fluid (PCF) analysis is emerging as an important tool for the early detection of biochemical and molecular changes in the cardiac tissue. With the epicardium acting as a semi-permeable membrane, the composition of PCF reflects the activity of the cardiac interstitium. Emerging research on PCF composition has identified promising biomarkers which may help stratify the risk for developing POAF. These include inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-6, mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid, and myeloperoxidase, as well as natriuretic peptides. Additionally, PCF appears to be superior to serum analysis in detecting changes in these molecules during the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery. The aim of the present narrative review is to summarize the current literature on the temporal changes in the levels of potential biomarkers in PCF after cardiac surgery and their association with the development of new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation.", "journal": "Trends in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2023-03-03", "authors": ["KieraLiblik", "JamesZucker", "AdrianBaranchuck", "Angel LuisFernandez", "ShetuanZhang", "Mohammad ElDiasty"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tcm.2023.02.009"}
{"title": "RSU-Net: U-net based on residual and self-attention mechanism in the segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images.", "abstract": "Automated segmentation techniques for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are beneficial for evaluating cardiac functional parameters in clinical diagnosis. However, due to the characteristics of unclear image boundaries and anisotropic resolution anisotropy produced by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging technology, most of the existing methods still have the problems of intra-class uncertainty and inter-class uncertainty. However, due to the irregularity of the anatomical shape of the heart and the inhomogeneity of tissue density, the boundaries of its anatomical structures become uncertain and discontinuous. Therefore, fast and accurate segmentation of cardiac tissue remains a challenging problem in medical image processing.\nWe collected cardiac MRI data from 195 patients as training set and 35patients from different medical centers as external validation set. Our research proposed a U-net network architecture with residual connections and a self-attentive mechanism (Residual Self-Attention U-net, RSU-Net). The network relies on the classic U-net network, adopts the U-shaped symmetric architecture of the encoding and decoding mode, improves the convolution module in the network, introduces skip connections, and improves the network's capacity for feature extraction. Then for solving locality defects of ordinary convolutional networks. To achieve a global receptive field, a self-attention mechanism is introduced at the bottom of the model. The loss function employs a combination of Cross Entropy Loss and Dice Loss to jointly guide network training, resulting in more stable network training.\nIn our study, we employ the Hausdorff distance (HD) and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) as metrics for assessing segmentation outcomes. Comparsion was made with the segmentation frameworks of other papers, and the comparison results prove that our RSU-Net network performs better and can make accurate segmentation of the heart. New ideas for scientific research.\nOur proposed RSU-Net network combines the advantages of residual connections and self-attention. This paper uses the residual links to facilitate the training of the network. In this paper, a self-attention mechanism is introduced, and a bottom self-attention block (BSA Block) is used to aggregate global information. Self-attention aggregates global information, and has achieved good segmentation results on the cardiac segmentation dataset. It facilitates the diagnosis of cardiovascular patients in the future.", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "date": "2023-03-03", "authors": ["Yuan-ZheLi", "YiWang", "Yin-HuiHuang", "PingXiang", "Wen-XiLiu", "Qing-QuanLai", "Yi-YuanGao", "Mao-ShengXu", "Yi-FanGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107437"}

{"title": "Conduction of excitation waves and reentry drift on cardiac tissue with simulated photocontrol-varied excitability.", "abstract": "The development of new approaches to suppressing cardiac arrhythmias requires a deep understanding of spiral wave dynamics. The study of spiral waves is possible in model systems, for example, in a monolayer of cardiomyocytes. A promising way to control cardiac excitability in vitro is the noninvasive photocontrol of cell excitability mediated by light-sensitive azobenzene derivatives, such as azobenzene trimethylammonium bromide (AzoTAB). The trans-isomer of AzoTAB suppresses spontaneous activity and excitation propagation speed, whereas the cis isomer has no detectable effect on the electrical properties of cardiomyocyte monolayers; cis isomerization occurs under the action of near ultraviolet (UV) light, and reverse isomerization occurs when exposed to blue light. Thus, AzoTAB makes it possible to create patterns of excitability in conductive tissue. Here, we investigate the effect of a simulated excitability gradient in cardiac cell culture on the behavior and termination of reentry waves. Experimental data indicate a displacement of the reentry wave, predominantly in the direction of lower excitability. However, both shifts in the direction of higher excitability and shift absence were also observed. To explain this effect, we reproduced these experiments in a computer model. Computer simulations showed that the explanation of the mechanism of observed drift to a lower excitability area requires not only a change in excitability coefficients (ion currents) but also a change in the diffusion coefficient; this may be the effect of the substance on intercellular connections. In addition, it was found that the drift direction depended on the observation time due to the meandering of the spiral wave. Thus, we experimentally proved the possibility of noninvasive photocontrol and termination of spiral waves with a mechanistic explanation in computer models.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2023-03-02", "authors": ["A ANizamieva", "I YKalita", "M MSlotvitsky", "A KBerezhnoy", "N SShubina", "S RFrolova", "V ATsvelaya", "K IAgladze"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0122273"}

{"title": "Accelerated Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy in an Orthotopic Heart Transplant Recipient with Prior COVID-19.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a post-orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) complication driven by intimal smooth muscle proliferation and immune hyperactivity to donor heart tissue. Accelerated CAV leads to allograft failure within 1 year after receiving a normal angiogram result. Viruses can contribute to CAV development, but CAV after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been reported to date. CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man, 5 years after OHT for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit with 3 days of abdominal pain, dyspnea, and palpitations. His medical history included hyperlipidemia and insulin-dependent diabetes. He was compliant with all medications. Two months prior, he had a mild COVID-19 case. An echocardiogram and coronary angiogram 6 and 9 months prior, respectively, were unremarkable. Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated increased filling pressures, a cardiac index of 1.7 L/ml/m\u00b2, and diffuse vasculopathy most severe in the LAD artery. Flow could not be restored despite repeated ballooning and intra-catheter adenosine. Empiric ionotropic support, daily high-dose methylprednisolone, and plasmapheresis were started. A few days later, the patient had cardiac arrest requiring venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation. Given CAV's irreversibility, re-transplantation was considered, but the patient had an episode of large-volume hemoptysis and remained clinically unstable for transplant. The patient died while on palliative care. CONCLUSIONS Our patient developed accelerated CAV 2 months after having COVID-19. While CAV has known associations with certain viruses, its incidence after SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Further research is needed to determine if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is a risk factor for development of CAV in OHT recipients.", "journal": "The American journal of case reports", "date": "2023-03-02", "authors": ["Neil UParikh", "Neal MDixit", "Austin BChurchill", "AndreaOliveira-Kowaleski", "Ryan PLau", "Gregory AFishbein", "Jeffrey JHsu"], "doi": "10.12659/AJCR.937955"}
{"title": "Ambient circulation surrounding an ablation catheter tip affects ablation lesion characteristics.", "abstract": "The association between ambient circulating environments (CEs) and ablation lesions has been largely underexplored.\nViable bovine myocardium was placed in a saline bath in an ex vivo endocardial model. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation was performed using three different ablation catheters: 3.5\u2009mm open irrigated (OI), 4, and 8\u2009mm. Variable flow rates of surrounding bath fluids were applied to simulate standard flow, high flow, and no flow. For in vivo epicardial ablation, 24 rats underwent a single OI ablation and performed with circulating saline (30\u2009ml/min; n\u2009=\u200912), versus those immersed in saline without circulation (n\u2009=\u200912).\nHigh flow reduced ablation lesion volumes for all three catheters. In no-flow endocardial CE, both 4\u2009mm and OI catheters produced smaller lesions compared with standard flow. However, the 8\u2009mm catheter produced the largest lesions in a no-flow CE. Ablation performed in an in vivo model with CE resulted in smaller lesions compared with ablation performed in a no-flow environment. No statistically significant differences in steam pops were found among the groups.\nA higher endocardial CE flow can decrease RF effectiveness. Cardiac tissue subjected to no endocardial CE flow may also limit RF for 4\u2009mm catheters, but not for OI catheters; these findings may have implications for RF ablation safety and efficacy, especially in the epicardial space without circulating fluid or in the endocardium under varying flow conditions.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2023-03-01", "authors": ["UdiNussinovitch", "PaulWang", "MeghediBabakhanian", "Sanjiv MNarayan", "MohanViswanathan", "NitishBadhwar", "LijunZheng", "William HSauer", "Duy TNguyen"], "doi": "10.1111/jce.15874"}

Cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis increased mitochondrial biogenesis and function in skeletal muscles and adipocytes. Here, we studied the effect of intermittent cold exposure on the regulators of cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis, function, and its regulation by SIRT-3. Intermittent cold exposed mice hearts showed normal histopathology with increased mitochondrial antioxidant and metabolic function, as evidenced by an increase in the activity and expression of MnSOD and SDH. A substantial increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number and increase in the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and its downstream targets NRF-1 and Tfam indicated the possibility of enhanced cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis and function on intermittent cold exposure. Increased mitochondrial SIRT-3 level and decreased total protein lysine acetylation indicate increased sirtuin activity in cold exposed mice hearts. Ex vivo cold mimic using norepinephrine showed a significant increase in PGC-1\u03b1, NRF-1, and Tfam levels.

The existing methods for culturing cardiac fibroblasts involve complicated steps and require special reagents and instruments. The major problems faced with primary cardiac fibroblast culture are the low yield and viability of the cultured cells and contamination with other heart cell types, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Numerous parameters, including the quality of the reagents used for the culture, conditions maintained during digestion of the cardiac tissue, composition of the digestion mixture used, and age of the pups used for culture determine the yield and purity of the cultured cardiac fibroblasts. The present study describes a detailed and simplified protocol to isolate and culture primary cardiac fibroblasts from neonatal murine pups. We demonstrate the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts through transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 treatment, representing the changes in fibroblasts during cardiac fibrosis. These cells can be used to study the various aspects of cardiac fibrosis, inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, and growth.", "journal": "Bio-protocol", "date": "2023-02-28", "authors": ["ShwetaKumar", "DimpleNagesh", "VenketsubbuRamasubbu", "Arathi BangalorePrabhashankar", "Nagalingam RaviSundaresan"], "doi": "10.21769/BioProtoc.4616"}

Co-treatment of BAI with CAP significantly reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells, improved their cytotoxic effect, markedly elevated the percentage of the sub-G1 population, drastically reduced the G2/M population, and significantly altered the mRNA expression of BAX and Bcl2 genes compared with each treatment alone.

Chagas cardiomyopathy, elicited by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, is associated with chronic inflammation, fibrosis and hypertrophy. This study aimed to explore the involvement of the TWEAK/Fn 14 axis in development of Chagas heart disease. Parasite infection in vitro triggered Fn14 overexpression in atrial HL-1 myocytes and cardiac MCF fibroblasts. Fn14 levels were also increased in heart tissue from C57BL/6 mice at 130 days post-infection, particularly in myocytes and fibroblasts. Concurrently, TWEAK expression in circulating monocytes from this group was higher than that determined in uninfected controls. TWEAK/Fn14 interaction was functional in myocytes and fibroblasts isolated from infected hearts, leading to TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)-mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) signaling. Ex vivo stimulation of both cell types with recombinant TWEAK for 24\u00a0h boosted the NF\u03baB-regulated production of proinflammatory/profibrotic mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, CCL2, CCL5, MMP-2, MMP-9, ICAM-1, E-selectin) involved in chronic T. cruzi cardiomyopathy. We further evaluated the therapeutic potential of the soluble decoy receptor Fn14-Fc to interfere with TWEAK/Fn14-dependent pathogenic activity. Fn14-Fc treatment of chronically infected mice was effective in neutralizing the ligand and reverting electrocardiographic abnormalities, maladaptive inflammation, adverse remodeling and hypertrophy in myocardium. Altogether, these findings suggest that sustained TWEAK/Fn14 induction by persistent T. cruzi infection is implicated in cardiopathogenesis and make TWEAK/Fn14 axis a promising target for the treatment of chronic Chagas heart disease.", "journal": "Experimental parasitology", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["Miguel HSantamar\u00eda", "Luisa DelgadoR\u00edos", "Ricardo SCorral"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108491"}
{"title": "Drp1/p53 interaction mediates p53 mitochondrial localization and dysfunction in septic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Previous studies have implicated p53-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis induced end organ injury, including sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD). However, the mechanisms behind p53 localization to the mitochondria have not been well established. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a mediator of mitochondrial fission, may play a role in p53 mitochondrial localization. Here we examined the role of Drp1/p53 interaction in SIMD using in vitro and murine models of sepsis.\nH9c2 cardiomyoblasts and BALB/c mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to model sepsis phenotype. Pharmacologic inhibitors of Drp1 activation (\u03c8Drp1) and of p53 mitochondrial binding (pifithrin \u03bc, PFT\u03bc) were utilized to assess interaction between Drp1 and p53, and the subsequent downstream impact on mitochondrial morphology and function, cardiomyocyte function, and sepsis phenotype.\nBoth in vitro and murine models demonstrated an increase in physical Drp1/p53 interaction following LPS treatment, which was associated with increased p53 mitochondrial localization, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This Drp1/p53 interaction was inhibited by \u03a8Drp1, suggesting that this interaction is dependent on Drp1 activation. Treatment of H9c2 cells with either \u03a8Drp1 or PFT\u03bc inhibited the LPS mediated localization of Drp1/p53 to the mitochondria, decreased oxidative stress, improved cellular respiration and ATP production. Similarly, treatment of BALB/c mice with either \u03a8Drp1 or PFT\u03bc decreased LPS-mediated mitochondrial localization of p53, mitochondrial ROS in cardiac tissue, and subsequently improved cardiomyocyte contractile function and survival.\nDrp1/p53 interaction and mitochondrial localization is a key prodrome to mitochondrial damage in SIMD and inhibiting this interaction may serve as a therapeutic target.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["RiddhitaMukherjee", "Laura HTetri", "Sin-JinLi", "GiovanniFajardo", "Nicolai POstberg", "Kaleb BTsegay", "KanikaGera", "Timothy TCornell", "DanielBernstein", "DariaMochly-Rosen", "BereketeabHaileselassie"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.01.008\n10.1242/jcs.114439"}
{"title": "Targeting Epigenetic Changes Mediated by Members of the SMYD Family of Lysine Methyltransferases.", "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in epigenetic changes in gene expression is essential to the clinical management of diseases linked to the SMYD family of lysine methyltransferases. The five known SMYD enzymes catalyze the transfer of donor methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to specific lysines on histones and non-histone substrates. SMYDs family members have distinct tissue distributions and tissue-specific functions, including regulation of development, cell differentiation, and embryogenesis. Diseases associated with SMYDs include the repressed transcription of SMYD1 genes needed for the formation of ion channels in the heart leading to heart failure, SMYD2 overexpression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or p53-related cancers, and poor prognosis associated with SMYD3 overexpression in more than 14 types of cancer including breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Given the importance of epigenetics in various pathologies, the development of epigenetic inhibitors has attracted considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmacologic development of the inhibitors involves the identification of molecules regulating both functional SMYD SET (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax) and MYND (Myeloid-Nervy-DEAF1) domains, a process facilitated by available X-ray structures for SMYD1, SMYD2, and SMYD3. Important leads for potential pharmaceutical agents have been reported for SMYD2 and SMYD3 enzymes, and six epigenetic inhibitors have been developed for drugs used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (Vidaza, Dacogen), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Zoinza, Isrodax), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (Beleodag, Epidaza). The recently demonstrated reversal of SMYD histone methylation suggests that reversing the epigenetic effects of SMYDs in cancerous tissues may be a desirable target for pharmacological development.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["AlyssaPadilla", "John FManganaro", "LydiaHuesgen", "Deborah ARoess", "Mark ABrown", "Debbie CCrans"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules28042000\n10.3390/genes2010210\n10.18483/ijSci.878\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07387\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.02.043\n10.1038/s41467-022-30940-1\n10.1016/j.cophys.2017.10.001\n10.3892/ijo.2020.5095\n10.2174/1389450121666200325093104\n10.1186/s13148-019-0711-4\n10.1074/mcp.M700271-MCP200\n10.1126/science.1192428\n10.3390/biology10070581\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.08.002\n10.3390/cancers12010142\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.01.069\n10.1073/pnas.1800680115\n10.3389/fcell.2021.654682\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.12.005\n10.1016/j.leukres.2014.01.013\n10.1002/ar.22972\n10.1126/science.1063127\n10.1016/S0959-437X(02)00287-3\n10.1186/1476-4598-5-26\n10.1128/MCB.00341-19\n10.1002/bies.200900197\n10.1074/jbc.M101914200\n10.1105/tpc.107.056879\n10.1016/j.abb.2021.109040\n10.3390/ijms16011406\n10.18632/oncotarget.2970\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022290\n10.3390/diseases10010004\n10.1096/fj.02-0889com\n10.1038/s41419-018-0347-x\n10.1038/ncb1151\n10.1016/j.canlet.2013.10.026\n10.5483/BMBRep.2008.41.4.294\n10.1530/ERC-13-0375\n10.1016/j.humpath.2011.11.003\n10.1016/j.mce.2014.04.016\n10.1007/s12031-022-02051-5\n10.1002/jcp.24975\n10.3390/ijms21249549\n10.1021/acsmedchemlett.9b00170\n10.1016/j.str.2011.06.011\n10.1021/acsmedchemlett.5b00272\n10.3389/fonc.2018.00092\n10.2147/tcrm.2006.2.4.377\n10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0298\n10.4103/0019-5154.160511\n10.1038/ja.2011.35\n10.1177/2040620715592567\n10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.06.05\n10.1021/ml400496h\n10.1074/jbc.M114.626861\n10.1016/j.ccr.2021.214143\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01689\n10.1016/S0169-409X(00)00129-0\n10.1021/jm901137j\n10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00559\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4097\n10.1002/tcr.201800082\n10.1016/j.jmgm.2016.07.001\n10.1074/jbc.M110.168187\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021640\n10.1093/jmcb/mjr015\n10.1016/j.gene.2022.146928\n10.1016/j.jmb.2010.12.014\n10.1016/j.cbpb.2016.01.004\n10.3390/biom12060783\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.108834\n10.1126/science.aal3321\n10.3390/vetsci7020063\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.09.012\n10.1038/s41435-020-0094-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009748\n10.1371/journal.pone.0003008\n10.1038/ncb0804-685\n10.1038/bjc.2014.543\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1007578\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001499\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2022.113076\n10.1186/s13072-017-0115-7\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0828\n10.1016/j.molcel.2012.07.020\n10.1038/srep29157\n10.1016/j.jgg.2021.03.004\n10.1242/jcs.084772\n10.1371/journal.pone.0121765\n10.1152/ajpheart.00235.2016\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2015.06.019\n10.1093/bbb/zbab167\n10.1038/s41598-019-42953-w\n10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100129\n10.7150/thno.37628\n10.1016/j.chom.2017.04.011\n10.1093/jmcb/mjr025\n10.1111/cns.13587\n10.1101/gad.177758.111\n10.3390/vetsci7030100\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.06.019\n10.3389/fendo.2022.863708\n10.1159/000495885\n10.11005/jbm.2021.28.4.297\n10.1016/j.jmb.2014.02.019\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00306\n10.2147/OTT.S186806\n10.3390/cancers14143542\n10.1200/JCO.2001.19.22.4224\n10.1186/1751-0147-50-27\n10.1038/nature13320\n10.1002/bies.201400120\n10.3892/ol.2021.12603\n10.1177/24725552211019409\n10.1021/acsmedchemlett.9b00493\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01890\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2022.114683\n10.1016/j.ccell.2016.01.013\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.014\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00309-X\n10.1016/j.genrep.2021.101392\n10.7150/jca.30041\n10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01129"}
{"title": "Chitosan-Based Scaffolds for the Treatment of Myocardial Infarction: A Systematic Review.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), such as myocardial infarction (MI), constitute one of the world's leading causes of annual deaths. This cardiomyopathy generates a tissue scar with poor anatomical properties and cell necrosis that can lead to heart failure. Necrotic tissue repair is required through pharmaceutical or surgical treatments to avoid such loss, which has associated adverse collateral effects. However, to recover the infarcted myocardial tissue, biopolymer-based scaffolds are used as safer alternative treatments with fewer side effects due to their biocompatibility, chemical adaptability and biodegradability. For this reason, a systematic review of the literature from the last five years on the production and application of chitosan scaffolds for the reconstructive engineering of myocardial tissue was carried out. Seventy-five records were included for review using the \"preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses\" data collection strategy. It was observed that the chitosan scaffolds have a remarkable capacity for restoring the essential functions of the heart through the mimicry of its physiological environment and with a controlled porosity that allows for the exchange of nutrients, the improvement of the electrical conductivity and the stimulation of cell differentiation of the stem cells. In addition, the chitosan scaffolds can significantly improve angiogenesis in the infarcted tissue by stimulating the production of the glycoprotein receptors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. Therefore, the possible mechanisms of action of the chitosan scaffolds on cardiomyocytes and stem cells were analyzed. For all the advantages observed, it is considered that the treatment of MI with the chitosan scaffolds is promising, showing multiple advantages within the regenerative therapies of CVD.", "journal":

{"title": "The Biological Implication of Semicarbazide-Sensitive Amine Oxidase (SSAO) Upregulation in Rat Systemic Inflammatory Response under Simulated Aerospace Environment.", "abstract": "The progress of space science and technology has ushered in a new era for humanity's exploration of outer space. Recent studies have indicated that the aerospace special environment including microgravity and space radiation poses a significant risk to the health of astronauts, which involves multiple pathophysiological effects on the human body as well on tissues and organs. It has been an important research topic to study the molecular mechanism of body damage and further explore countermeasures against the physiological and pathological changes caused by the space environment. In this study, we used the rat model to study the biological effects of the tissue damage and related molecular pathway under either simulated microgravity or heavy ion radiation or combined stimulation. Our study disclosed that ureaplasma-sensitive amino oxidase (SSAO) upregulation is closely related to the systematic inflammatory response (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) in rats under a simulated aerospace environment. In particular, the space environment leads to significant changes in the level of inflammatory genes in heart tissues, thus altering the expression and activity of SSAO and causing inflammatory responses.

{"title": "Anti-Fibrotic Potential of Angiotensin (1-7) in Hemodynamically Overloaded Rat Heart.", "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic structure controlling the proper functioning of heart muscle. ECM remodeling with enhanced collagen deposition due to hemodynamic overload impairs cardiomyocyte adhesion and electrical coupling that contributes to cardiac mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmias. We aimed to explore ECM and connexin-43 (Cx43) signaling pathways in hemodynamically overloaded rat heart as well as the possible implication of angiotensin (1-7) (Ang (1-7)) to prevent/attenuate adverse myocardial remodeling. Male 8-week-old, normotensive Hannover Spraque-Dawley rats (HSD), hypertensive (mRen-2)27 transgenic rats (TGR) and Ang (1-7) transgenic rats (TGR(A1-7)3292) underwent aortocaval fistula (ACF) to produce volume overload. Five weeks later, biometric and heart tissue analyses were performed. Cardiac hypertrophy in response to volume overload was significantly less pronounced in TGR(A1-7)3292 compared to HSD rats. Moreover, a marker of fibrosis hydroxyproline was increased in both ventricles of volume-overloaded TGR while it was reduced in the Ang (1-7) right heart ventricle. The protein level and activity of MMP-2 were reduced in both ventricles of volume-overloaded TGR/TGR(A1-7)3292 compared to HSD. SMAD2/3 protein levels were decreased in the right ventricle of TGR(A1-7)3292 compared to HSD/TGR in response to volume overload. In parallel, Cx43 and pCx43 implicated in electrical coupling were increased in TGR(A1-7)3292 versus HSD/TGR. It can be concluded that Ang (1-7) exhibits cardio-protective and anti-fibrotic potential in conditions of cardiac volume overload.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["MatusSykora", "VojtechKratky", "LiborKopkan", "NarcisaTribulova", "BarbaraSzeiffova Bacova"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24043490\n10.1093/cvr/cvac013\n10.1093/cvr/cvv002\n10.1016/j.biochi.2015.02.020\n10.1242/bio.058777\n10.1038/nrm3904\n10.1093/cvr/17.1.15\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.11.001\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2003.10.019\n10.1007/s00441-014-2020-8\n10.1042/BST20150059\n10.33549/physiolres.931546\n10.1007/s10787-022-00962-8\n10.1152/ajpheart.00937.2006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00846.2011\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.04.007\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.108.840124\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000205833.89478.5b\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.984472\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134579\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109826\n10.1007/s10741-017-9634-3\n10.4161/chan.5.3.15834\n10.1152/ajpheart.01186.2004\n10.1159/000331562\n10.1159/000501688\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.143255\n10.1155/2011/729497\n10.1007/s11010-011-0808-3\n10.1111/bph.13225\n10.1093/ajh/hpz009\n10.2337/db12-0792\n10.1177/1535370215616511\n10.1371/journal.pone.0184161\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.10.027\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.2007.04689.x\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00028-6\n10.1007/s10863-020-09867-z\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0411\n10.1677/joe.0.1580027\n10.1172/jci200524178\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.07.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.07.013\n10.3390/nu9111191\n10.1007/s00418-016-1488-6\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.11.013\n10.1093/abbs/gmy090\n10.1016/S1357-2725(03)00264-4\n10.3390/ijms21020526\n10.1074/jbc.M113.533265\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.1080131\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00227.2003\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000093383.18302.A7\n10.1159/000495391\n10.3390/antiox9060546\n10.3390/ijms13010369\n10.1139/cjpp-2012-0393\n10.3390/biomedicines10071707\n10.1111/jcmm.13697\n10.1016/0003-2697(84)90084-8"}

The immune system is involved in modulating the severity of kidney injury, and the role of immune system cells in the development of CRS 3 is not well established. The present work aims to characterize the macrophage and T and B lymphocyte populations in kidney and heart tissue after AKI induced by renal I/R. Thus, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a renal I/R protocol by occlusion of the left renal pedicle (unilateral) for 60 min, followed by reperfusion for 3, 8 and 15 days. The immune cell populations of interest were identified using flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR was used to evaluate gene expression. As a result, a significant increase in TCD4+, TCD8+ lymphocytes and M1 macrophages to the renal tissue was observed, while B cells in the heart decreased. A renal tissue repair response characterized by Foxp3 activation predominated. However, a more inflammatory profile was shown in the heart tissue influenced by IL-17RA and IL-1\u03b2.

{"title": "Melatonin Supplement Plus Exercise Effectively Counteracts the Challenges of Isoproterenol-Induced Cardiac Injury in Rats.", "abstract": "To explore the combined effects of exercise and melatonin supplement against the challenges of isoproterenol-induced cardiac oxidative stress and injury in rats., the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), mitochondrial biogenesis, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was up-regulated in cardiac muscle in normal rats and in a melatonin and exercise regimented group. Cardiac injury was induced by two subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol in the rats. The combination of exercise and melatonin supplement successfully counteracted the isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury, which is reflected by the improved hemodynamic parameters, reduction in oxidative stress markers, and cardiac injury serum markers (cardiac troponin-I and creatine kinase-MB). The cardiac tissue level of ATP, expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes, mitochondrial membrane potential, and the activities of typical antioxidants (glutathione, superoxide dismutase) were preserved, whereas the levels of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory cytokines were suppressed in the melatonin and exercise regimented (MEI) group compared to the group treated with isoproterenol alone.

{"title": "Biochemical, Histological, and Ultrastructural Studies of the Protective Role of Vitamin E on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Male Rats.", "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CP) (Cytoxan or Endoxan) is an efficient anti-tumor agent, widely used for the treatment of various neoplastic diseases. The study aimed to investigate the protective role of vitamin E (vit E) in improving cardiotoxicity in rats induced by CP.\nForty male Wistar rats were divided randomly into four experimental groups (each consisting of ten rats); the control group was treated with saline. The other three groups were treated with vit E, CP, and the combination of vit E and CP. Serum lipid profiles, enzyme cardiac biomarkers, and cardiac tissue antioxidants were evaluated, as well as histological and ultrastructure investigations.\nCP-treated rats showed a significant increase in serum levels of cardiac markers (troponin, CK, LDH, AST, and ALT), lipid profiles, a reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities (CAT, SOD, and GPx), and an elevation in the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO). The increase in the levels of troponin, LDH, AST, ALP, and triglycerides is a predominant indicator of cardiac damage due to the toxic effect of CP. The biochemical changes parallel cardiac injuries such as myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and heart failure. Vitamin E played a pivotal role, as it attenuated most of these changes because of its ability to scavenge free radicals and reduce LPO. In addition, vit E was found to improve the histopathological alterations caused by CP where no evidence of damage was observed in the cardiac architecture, and the cardiac fibers had regained their normal structure with minimal hemorrhage.\nAs a result of its antioxidant activity and its stabilizing impact on the cardiomyocyte membranes, vit E is recommended as a potential candidate in decreasing the damaging effects of CP.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["Azza AAttia", "Jehan MSorour", "Neama AMohamed", "Tagreed TMansour", "Rasha AAl-Eisa", "Nahla SEl-Shenawy"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines11020390\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0735\n10.1093/annonc/mdx318\n10.1002/em.20372\n10.3390/ijms231911615\n10.1139/cjpp-2015-0405\n10.3390/biomedicines8120549\n10.1177/2156587218757649\n10.1111/imm.12913\n10.2147/DDDT.S279128\n10.3390/ijms231911664\n10.1016/j.ajme.2017.09.001\n10.1002/med.21592\n10.1016/j.jsps.2017.12.013\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00477\n10.3904/kjim.2013.28.4.420\n10.1016/0888-7543(90)90168-T\n10.1155/S1463924694000210\n10.1093/clinchem/20.4.470\n10.1093/clinchem/19.5.476\n10.1093/clinchem/25.4.560\n10.3109/09513599609012817\n10.1016/0003-2697(79)90738-3\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1974.tb03714.x\n10.5555/URI:PII:0022214367900765\n10.1155/2022/5096825\n10.3390/antiox10050634\n10.1016/j.jphs.2021.07.007\n10.1139/cjpp-2015-0138\n10.1007/s12011-017-1231-8\n10.1101/cshperspect.a023200\n10.3892/br.2015.500\n10.3390/ijms21020601\n10.1371/journal.pone.0204913\n10.5114/ceji.2017.72804\n10.7603/s40730-015-0005-1\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.02.040\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131394\n10.1016/j.etp.2017.02.002\n10.20455/ros.2016.845\n10.1002/jcsm.12178\n10.1293/tox.2013-0025\n10.1104/pp.16.00941\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.176158\n10.1194/jlr.R400001-JLR200\n10.7759/cureus.15616\n10.1501/Eczfak_0000000393\n10.1038/ncomms1594"}
{"title": "SDF-1\u03b1-Releasing Microspheres Effectively Extend Stem Cell Homing after Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the main focuses in today's healthcare due to its implications and complications, and it is predicted to be increasing in prevalence due to the ageing population. Although the conventional pharmacological and interventional methods for the treatment of IHD presents with success in the clinical setting, the long-term complications of cardiac insufficiency are on a continual incline as a result of post-infarction remodeling of the cardiac tissue. The migration and involvement of stem cells to the cardiac muscle, followed by differentiation into cardiac myocytes, has been proven to be the natural process, though at a slow rate. SDF-1\u03b1 is a novel candidate to mobilize stem cells homing to the ischemic heart. Endogenous SDF-1\u03b1 levels are elevated after myocardial infarction, but their presence gradually decreases after approximately seven days. Additional administration of SDF-1\u03b1-releasing microspheres could be a tool for the extension of the time the stem cells are in the cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction. This, in turn, could constitute a novel therapy for more efficient regeneration of the heart muscle after injury. Through this practical study, it has been shown that the controlled release of SDF-1\u03b1 from biodegradable microspheres into the pericardial sac fourteen days after myocardial infarction increases the concentration of exogenous SDF-1\u03b1, which persists in the tissue much longer than the level of endogenous SDF-1\u03b1. In addition, administration of SDF-1\u03b1-releasing microspheres increased the expression of the factors potentially involved in the involvement and retention of myocardial stem cells, which constitutes vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), stem cell factor (SCF), and vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAMs) at the site of damaged tissue. This exhibits the possibility of combating the basic limitations of cell therapy, including ineffective stem cell implantation and the ability to induce the migration of endogenous stem cells to the ischemic cardiac tissue and promote heart repair.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["KarolinaBajdak-Rusinek", "AgnieszkaFus-Kujawa", "PiotrBuszman", "Dorota\u017by\u0142a-Uklejewicz", "KatarzynaJelonek", "MonikaMusia\u0142-Kulik", "CarlosFernandez", "MagdalenaMichalak", "KurianGeorge", "JanuszKasperczyk", "Pawe\u0142Buszman"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines11020343\n10.7759/cureus.9349\n10.1016/j.repc.2021.02.011\n10.1002/ehf2.13144\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.25.2981\n10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.08.71\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312586\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.01.004\n10.4252/wjsc.v13.i4.236\n10.1146/annurev.pathol.2.010506.092038\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.09.011\n10.1161/01.RES.0000150856.47324.5b\n10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14232-8\n10.1023/A:1012808525370\n10.1007/s00395-015-0475-8\n10.3892/ijmm.2011.643\n10.1016/j.thromres.2011.10.020\n10.33963/KP.15650\n10.3390/bioengineering9120754\n10.1093/nar/29.9.e45\n10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01790.x\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.1023/B:HIJO.0000032355.66152.b8\n10.1007/s00005-006-0015-1\n10.1007/s12265-010-9219-1\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2009.00507.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvm027\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00120.x\n10.1155/2013/561098\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147609.39780.02\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.672451\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.112.979633\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.718718\n10.1089/ten.2006.0013\n10.1096/fj.06-6558com\n10.1038/leu.2011.242\n10.1038/srep26683\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2017.12.020\n10.3390/ma13122702\n10.1186/s12964-015-0124-8\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00403\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147780.30124.CF\n10.1182/blood.V92.3.894\n10.1073/pnas.95.24.14423\n10.1172/JCI7615\n10.2147/IJN.S180859\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.01.036\n10.1021/acsami.9b01532\n10.1002/mabi.201500178"}
{"title": "Microplastics: A Matter of the Heart (and Vascular System).", "abstract": "Plastic use dramatically increased over the past few years. Besides obvious benefits, the consequent plastic waste and mismanagement in disposal have caused ecological problems. Plastic abandoned in the environment is prone to segregation, leading to the generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs), which can reach aquatic and terrestrial organisms. MPs/NPs in water can access fish's bodies through the gills, triggering an inflammatory response in loco. Furthermore, from the gills, plastic fragments can be transported within the circulatory system altering blood biochemical parameters and hormone levels and leading to compromised immunocompetence and angiogenesis. In addition, it was also possible to observe an unbalanced ROS production, damage in vascular structure, and enhanced thrombosis. MPs/NPs led to cardiotoxicity, pericardial oedema, and impaired heart rate in fish cardiac tissue. MPs/NPs effects on aquatic organisms pose serious health hazards and ecological consequences because they constitute the food chain for humans. Once present in the mammalian body, plastic particles can interact with circulating cells, eliciting an inflammatory response, with genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of immune cells, enhanced haemolysis, and endothelium adhesion. The interaction of MPs/NPs with plasma proteins allows their transport to distant organs, including the heart. As a consequence of plastic fragment internalisation into cardiomyocytes, oxidative stress was increased, and metabolic parameters were altered. In this scenario, myocardial damage, fibrosis and impaired electrophysiological values were observed. In summary, MPs/NPs are an environmental stressor for cardiac function in living organisms, and a risk assessment of their influence on the cardiovascular system certainly merits further analysis.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["ElisaPersiani", "AntonellaCecchettini", "ElisaCeccherini", "IlariaGisone", "Maria AuroraMorales", "FedericoVozzi"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines11020264\n10.1126/science.1260352\n10.1371/journal.pone.0111913\n10.1016/j.ancene.2016.01.002\n10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.01.032\n10.1038/s41598-018-33683-6\n10.1021/es201811s\n10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.05.030\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.041\n10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.024\n10.1111/gcb.14020\n10.1016/j.envint.2017.02.013\n10.1038/s41559-017-0116\n10.1002/ieam.1901\n10.1002/etc.4323\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113011\n10.1002/ieam.1904\n10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.07.052\n10.1038/ncomms11587\n10.1016/j.watres.2019.114979\n10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.031\n10.1021/es5053655\n10.1038/s41598-017-18849-y\n10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.07.036\n10.1371/journal.pone.0032254\n10.1126/science.abe5041\n10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.012\n10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.11.008\n10.1038/srep46173\n10.1080/19440049.2013.843025\n10.1021/acs.est.9b02540\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.102\n10.1016/j.watres.2019.02.054\n10.1016/j.watres.2018.05.027\n10.1016/j.watres.2019.03.091\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.092\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.1995.tb06714.x\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.1990.tb07033.x\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128323\n10.1016/j.tiv.2015.11.006\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147444\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121575\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126069\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113238\n10.1021/acs.est.6b00183\n10.1016/j.envpol.2018.03.001\n10.1021/es800249a\n10.1247/csf.20.355\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.07.066\n10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113024\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131124\n10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.06.008\n10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.06.016\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.186\n10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.11.017\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122058\n10.4172/2157-7439.1000193\n10.1039/D0EN00748J\n10.1007/s10565-013-9265-y\n10.1073/pnas.0805135105\n10.1038/s41598-019-45139-6\n10.1007/s12013-015-0705-6\n10.1021/nn103077k\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.071\n10.1038/mi.2013.88\n10.1152/ajplung.00283.2002\n10.1016/j.fct.2021.112356\n10.1136/oem.2006.027292\n10.1186/s12989-014-0063-3\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127629\n10.1007/s11051-015-3029-y\n10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116974\n10.1007/s00204-019-02478-7\n10.1186/s12989-020-00385-9\n10.3390/ijms131113781\n10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115025\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121175\n10.1016/j.coesh.2017.10.003\n10.1113/JP278885"}
{"title": "Toward a Physiologically Relevant 3D Helicoidal-Oriented Cardiac Model: Simultaneous Application of Mechanical Stimulation and Surface Topography.", "abstract": "Myocardium consists of cardiac cells that interact with their environment through physical, biochemical, and electrical stimulations. The physiology, function, and metabolism of cardiac tissue are affected by this dynamic structure. Within the myocardium, cardiomyocytes' orientations are parallel, creating a dominant orientation. Additionally, local alignments of fibers, along with a helical organization, become evident at the macroscopic level. For the successful development of a reliable in vitro cardiac model, evaluation of cardiac cells' behavior in a dynamic microenvironment, as well as their spatial architecture, is mandatory. In this study, we hypothesize that complex interactions between long-term contraction boundary conditions and cyclic mechanical stimulation may provide a physiological mechanism to generate off-axis alignments in the preferred mechanical stretch direction. This off-axis alignment can be engineered in vitro and, most importantly, mirrors the helical arrangements observed in vivo. For this purpose, uniaxial mechanical stretching of dECM-fibrin hydrogels was performed on pre-aligned 3D cultures of cardiac cells. In view of the potential development of helical structures similar to those in native hearts, the possibility of generating oblique alignments ranging between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 was explored. Indeed, our investigations of cell alignment in 3D, employing both mechanical stimulation and groove constraint, provide a reliable mechanism for the generation of helicoidal structures in the myocardium. By combining cyclic stretch and geometric alignment in grooves, an intermediate angle toward favored direction can be achieved experimentally: while cyclic stretch produces a perpendicular orientation, geometric alignment is associated with a parallel one. In our 2D and 3D culture conditions, nonlinear cellular addition of the strains and strain avoidance concept reliably predicted the preferred cellular alignment. The 3D dECM-fibrin model system in this study shows that cyclical stretching supports cell survival and development. Using mechanical stimulation of pre-aligned heart cells, maturation markers are augmented in neonatal cardiomyocytes, while the beating culture period is prolonged, indicating an improved model function. We propose a simplified theoretical model based on numerical simulation and nonlinear strain avoidance by cells to explain oblique alignment angles.

{"title": "The Role of Hydrogel in Cardiac Repair and Regeneration for Myocardial Infarction: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives.", "abstract": "A myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, seriously threatens human health, and becomes a major health burden of our society. It is urgent to pursue effective therapeutic strategies for the regeneration and restore myocardial function after MI. This review discusses the role of hydrogel in cardiac repair and regeneration for MI. Hydrogel-based cardiac patches and injectable hydrogels are the most commonly used applications in cardiac regeneration medicine. With injectable hydrogels, bioactive compounds and cells can be delivered in situ, promoting in situ repair and regeneration, while hydrogel-based cardiac patches reduce myocardial wall stress, which passively inhibits ventricular expansion. Hydrogel-based cardiac patches work as mechanically supportive biomaterials. In cardiac regeneration medicine, clinical trials and commercial products are limited. Biomaterials, biochemistry, and biological actives, such as intelligent hydrogels and hydrogel-based exosome patches, which may serve as an effective treatment for MI in the future, are still under development. Further investigation of clinical feasibility is warranted. We can anticipate hydrogels having immense translational potential for cardiac regeneration in the near future.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["PingLi", "JiajiaHu", "JianWang", "JunjieZhang", "LuWang", "ChengliangZhang"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering10020165\n10.1038/s41467-020-14349-2\n10.1038/s41467-020-20361-3\n10.1001/jama.2021.5469\n10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01441-6\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c00454\n10.1007/s11886-018-1011-x\n10.1007/s00018-021-03831-9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.320717\n10.1007/s10741-020-09953-9\n10.1002/adhm.201801011\n10.1007/s11886-020-01361-7\n10.3390/ijms20225805\n10.1021/acsnano.8b06104\n10.1016/j.jcis.2019.05.085\n10.1016/j.msea.2019.138400\n10.1016/j.engreg.2021.11.002\n10.1021/acscatal.8b05171\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00755\n10.1002/adfm.201803567\n10.1038/s41467-021-21682-7\n10.1002/asia.202200604\n10.1152/ajpheart.00372.2022\n10.1002/adma.202109198\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.01.011\n10.1016/j.addr.2017.04.010\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121786\n10.1021/acsami.9b01886\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn017\n10.1002/adhm.201800672\n10.1590/s1679-45082018rb4538\n10.1007/s13346-018-00601-2\n10.1021/nn503693h\n10.1126/sciadv.abd8217\n10.1039/C6CS00052E\n10.1016/j.jare.2013.07.006\n10.1002/smll.201703305\n10.3390/ph14040291\n10.1021/acsnano.0c09577\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.08.011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.011\n10.1038/s41467-019-08355-2\n10.1126/sciadv.abd3716\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.10.061\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034005\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.08.006\n10.3390/polym14050986\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.04.020\n10.1073/pnas.1215498110\n10.1002/mabi.201800248\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120811\n10.3389/fchem.2019.00675\n10.1039/C6TB02158A\n10.1016/j.jcis.2019.12.096\n10.1021/acsapm.9b00863\n10.1016/j.clay.2015.12.018\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.239\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.116.004058\n10.1039/C9TB02049G\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.01.006\n10.3390/ijms21197111\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.08.068\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.09.005\n10.1080/14686996.2021.1938212\n10.1039/D2TB00623E\n10.1002/adfm.202000776\n10.1002/mame.201700221\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.11.075\n10.1039/C8QM00317C\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.120213\n10.1002/mabi.201700325\n10.1002/adhm.201300076\n10.1038/s41427-019-0165-3\n10.3390/polym14194019\n10.1016/j.addr.2019.06.001\n10.1016/S0168-3659(02)00410-8\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.106\n10.1038/s41598-018-19906-w\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00109\n10.1016/j.actbio.2022.09.077\n10.1021/acsami.8b01736\n10.1039/D0TB02119A\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.185\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.08.032\n10.1016/j.actbio.2020.01.017\n10.1002/jcsm.12178\n10.1039/d2tb00615d\n10.1155/2021/6614009\n10.1002/adhm.202101855\n10.1016/S0960-894X(01)00285-2\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.031\n10.1002/adhm.202200990\n10.1002/advs.202105408\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.023\n10.1021/bm4018963\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.05.044\n10.1021/acsnano.2c05168\n10.1038/s41551-019-0380-9\n10.1002/advs.201500122\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00126\n10.1038/s41467-019-12748-8\n10.1016/j.addr.2018.03.007\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz5380\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00418\n10.1021/acsnano.1c07649\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.06.001\n10.1038/s41591-021-01279-9\n10.1038/s41551-018-0247-5\n10.1002/adma.201601613\n10.1016/j.mser.2015.04.001\n10.1038/s41551-021-00796-9\n10.1039/C9TA13196E\n10.1038/s41563-020-00814-2\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.04.027\n10.1002/adma.201806712\n10.1002/adma.201704235\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0620\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.009\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.07.029\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.08.031\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311213\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c01177\n10.1002/advs.201801664\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.11.020\n10.1111/jcmm.13097\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02259\n10.1186/s12951-022-01354-4"}
{"title": "Heart in a dish - choosing the right in vitro model.", "abstract": "The heart is the first functional organ established during embryogenesis. Investigating heart development and disease is a fascinating and crucial field of research because cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, there is great interest in establishing in vitro models for recapitulating both physiological and pathological aspects of human heart development, tissue function and malfunction. Derived from pluripotent stem cells, a large variety of three-dimensional cardiac in vitro models have been introduced in recent years. In this At a Glance article, we discuss the available methods to generate such models, grouped according to the following classification: cardiac organoids, cardiac microtissues and engineered cardiac tissues. For these models, we provide a systematic overview of their applications for disease modeling and therapeutic development, as well as their advantages and limitations to assist scientists in choosing the most suitable model for their research purpose.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2023-02-25", "authors": ["LikaDrakhlis", "RobertZweigerdt"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.049961\n10.1038/s41467-018-05604-8\n10.1038/s41598-018-28393-y\n10.1002/term.3327\n10.1016/S0925-4773(99)00309-3\n10.3791/53252\n10.1038/nprot.2017.080\n10.1016/j.devcel.2006.07.005\n10.1126/scitranslmed.abd1817\n10.3389/fcell.2021.731101\n10.1101/cshperspect.a013847\n10.1016/S0012-1606(03)00112-X\n10.1242/dmm.030320\n10.1038/nprot.2017.033\n10.1038/nrg1710\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.12.013\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1093/cvr/cvac059\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19990905)64:5<580::AID-BIT8>3.0.CO;2-X\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.035\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.082\n10.1002/term.3165\n10.1038/ncb1696\n10.1093/cvr/cvr158\n10.1016/j.molmed.2011.05.001\n10.1038/s41598-019-47632-4\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.15252/emmm.201404757\n10.1038/s41587-021-00815-9\n10.1038/s41596-021-00629-8\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.009\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.010\n10.1038/nmeth.1740\n10.1096/fasebj.11.8.9240969\n10.1038/ncb3312\n10.3390/cells9071733\n10.1006/dbio.1993.1276\n10.1242/dev.143438\n10.1007/s00018-017-2546-5\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.05.004\n10.1038/s41467-019-13868-x\n10.1002/anie.201103909\n10.1242/dev.200557\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.10.023\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.06.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.034\n10.1242/dev.145193\n10.1126/science.284.5422.1998\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1007/10_2017_30\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.017\n10.1038/nprot.2015.089\n10.1038/ncomms13602\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs349\n10.3390/ijms22168482\n10.1038/s42003-022-03826-7\n10.1038/nature11799\n10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100280\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1242/dmm.039347\n10.1038/nature12517\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.10.008\n10.1038/s41467-021-25329-5\n10.1002/cpz1.461\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.014\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1101/gad.9.13.1654\n10.1016/j.aanat.2013.02.008\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.09.002\n10.1038/s41586-018-0150-y\n10.1101/gad.855501\n10.1073/pnas.1703109114\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.03.009\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.026\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.09.015\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.03.017\n10.1016/j.isci.2022.104486\n10.1038/nprot.2014.102\n10.1038/s41569-020-0359-y\n10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00405-2\n10.1038/ncb3205\n10.1038/nbt.3745\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.07.021\n10.1038/s41551-020-0539-4\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1016/j.stem.2020.10.013\n10.1038/s41598-022-17265-1\n10.1038/nature07935\n10.1101/2022.07.14.499699\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.023\n10.1242/dev.01570\n10.1016/j.stem.2021.11.007\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.09.003\n10.1006/dbio.1995.1102\n10.1016/S0012-1606(03)00433-0\n10.3390/ijms21238947\n10.1038/nature15695\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1126/science.abb2986\n10.1073/pnas.0702859104\n10.1242/dev.143966\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.249540\n10.1038/nbt.3002\n10.1007/s00204-010-0641-6\n10.1038/nrm3619\n10.1038/nature06894\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.042"}
{"title": "Unraveling Chamber-specific Differences in Intercalated Disc Ultrastructure and Molecular Organization and Their Impact on Cardiac Conduction.", "abstract": "During each heartbeat, the propagation of action potentials through the heart coordinates the contraction of billions of individual cardiomyocytes and is thus, a critical life process. Unsurprisingly, intercalated discs, which are cell-cell contact sites specialized to provide electrical and mechanical coupling between adjacent cardiomyocytes, have been the focus of much investigation. Slowed or disrupted propagation leads to potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in a wide range of pathologies, where intercalated disc remodeling is a common finding. Hence, the importance and urgency of understanding intercalated disc structure and its influence on action potential propagation. Surprisingly, however, conventional modeling approaches cannot predict changes in propagation elicited by perturbations that alter intercalated disc ultrastructure or molecular organization, owing to lack of quantitative structural data at subcellular through nano scales. In order to address this critical gap in knowledge, we sought to quantify intercalated disc structure at these finer spatial scales in the healthy adult mouse heart and relate them to function in a chamber-specific manner as a precursor to understanding the impacts of pathological intercalated disc remodeling. Using super-resolution light microscopy, electron microscopy, and computational image analysis, we provide here the first ever systematic, multiscale quantification of intercalated disc ultrastructure and molecular organization. By incorporating these data into a rule-based model of cardiac tissue with realistic intercalated disc structure, and comparing model predictions of electrical propagation with experimental measures of conduction velocity, we reveal that atrial intercalated discs can support faster conduction than their ventricular counterparts, which is normally masked by inter-chamber differences in myocyte geometry. Further, we identify key ultrastructural and molecular organization features underpinning the ability of atrial intercalated discs to support faster conduction. These data provide the first stepping stone to elucidating chamber-specific impacts of pathological intercalated disc remodeling, as occurs in many arrhythmic diseases.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2023-02-25", "authors": ["Heather LStruckman", "NicolaeMoise", "D RyanKing", "AndrewSoltisz", "AndrewBuxton", "IzabellaDunlap", "ZhenhuiChen", "Przemys\u0142aw BRadwa\u0144ski", "Seth HWeinberg", "RengasayeeVeeraraghavan"], "doi": "10.1101/2023.02.13.528369"}

{"title": "Cell death regulation in myocardial toxicity induced by antineoplastic drugs.", "abstract": "Homeostatic regulation of cardiomyocytes plays a critical role in maintaining normal physiological activity of cardiac tissue. Severe cardiotoxicity can lead to heart disease, including but not limited to arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and cardiac hypertrophy. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing new therapies for cancer that have dramatically changed the treatment of several malignancies and continue to improve patient survival, but can also lead to serious cardiac adverse effects. Mitochondria are key organelles that maintain homeostasis in myocardial tissue and have been extensively involved in various cardiovascular disease episodes, including ischemic cardiomyopathy, heart failure and stroke. Several studies support that mitochondrial targeting is a major determinant of the cardiotoxic effects triggered by chemotherapeutic agents increasingly used in solid and hematologic tumors. This antineoplastic therapy-induced mitochondrial toxicity is due to different mechanisms, usually altering the mitochondrial respiratory chain, energy production and mitochondrial kinetics, or inducing mitochondrial oxidative/nitrosative stress, ultimately leading to cell death. This review focuses on recent advances in forms of cardiac cell death and related mechanisms of antineoplastic drug-induced cardiotoxicity, including autophagy, ferroptosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, explores and evaluates key proteins involved in cardiac cell death signaling, and presents recent advances in cardioprotective strategies for this disease. It aims to provide theoretical basis and targets for the prevention and treatment of pharmacological cardiotoxicity in clinical settings.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2023-02-25", "authors": ["XueYu", "YanYang", "TianzuoChen", "YuqinWang", "TianweiGuo", "YujunLiu", "HongLi", "LimingYang"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2023.1075917\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.11.024\n10.1007/s00109-008-0434-z\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119760\n10.1042/CS20100254\n10.1155/2020/4965171\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2021.119039\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61121-X\n10.1016/j.ccl.2019.07.005\n10.1042/BCJ20160385\n10.4274/tjps.galenos.2021.84555\n10.1016/j.cbi.2008.09.012\n10.1038/s41423-020-00630-3\n10.1038/nm.4087\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32616-2\n10.1093/nar/gkn774\n10.18632/oncotarget.13596\n10.1080/15548627.2020.1810918\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.08.006\n10.1172/jci.insight.128834\n10.1002/biof.1301\n10.1016/j.ceb.2009.12.003\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.07.025\n10.1038/nchembio.83\n10.1007/s00441-012-1475-8\n10.1007/s00280-016-3233-1\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.09.085\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.65\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.133\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.1038/ncb1101-e255\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.917914\n10.1007/s00280-015-2879-4\n10.4161/cbt.26428\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.05.027\n10.1056/NEJMoa064320\n10.1111/jpi.12176\n10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107533\n10.2217/fca.12.44\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.102185\n10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312103\n10.1126/science.1123480\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103456\n10.3892/mmr.2022.12898\n10.1039/d1np00059d\n10.1530/REP-14-0422\n10.1007/s00277-016-2654-6\n10.1016/j.intimp.2018.12.028\n10.1002/smll.202102695\n10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2017-0279\n10.1042/BJ20050285\n10.1007/s40265-020-01281-4\n10.1002/cncr.10854\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041403\n10.1111/ajd.12406\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110412\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.037357\n10.15252/embj.2021108863\n10.1074/jbc.M109.070037\n10.1159/000227467\n10.18632/oncotarget.16944\n10.1007/s13238-020-00789-5\n10.1074/jbc.M111604200\n10.1186/s13104-017-2726-2\n10.2169/internalmedicine.52.0347\n10.1152/ajpheart.00738.2005\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.02.003\n10.1038/cdd.2011.155\n10.1002/pbc.25206\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.048\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017443\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.019\n10.1155/2014/748524\n10.1056/NEJMra1310050\n10.1038/s41419-020-02948-2\n10.1155/2014/616149\n10.1007/s10517-008-0287-z\n10.3390/ijms19113480\n10.1002/cmdc.202000131\n10.1074/jbc.M113.506485\n10.1200/JCO.2012.45.6095\n10.1128/MCB.21.4.1249-1259.2001\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.08.009\n10.3322/caac.21565\n10.1124/pr.56.2.6\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2015.11.004\n10.1007/978-94-007-2869-1_18\n10.1161/01.cir.102.5.572\n10.18632/oncotarget.11157\n10.1002/pmic.201800404\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131394\n10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00646-6\n10.1177/2156587218757649\n10.2165/00002018-200022040-00002\n10.1080/15548627.2020.1834711\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.04.238\n10.3892/etm.2017.5617\n10.1080/15548627.2020.1816342\n10.1161/hy09t1.096185\n10.1007/s12012-019-09535-8\n10.1007/s11010-016-2653-x\n10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109052\n10.1007/s11897-021-00519-w\n10.1002/ejhf.1461\n10.1111/1440-1681.13225\n10.2174/157339611796892265\n10.1093/annonc/mdy100\n10.1007/s00210-018-1506-4\n10.1016/j.canlet.2020.02.015\n10.3892/ijmm.2021.5072\n10.1016/j.bcp.2020.113888\n10.1200/JCO.1997.15.4.1318\n10.1038/sj.embor.7400779\n10.1186/s12967-017-1189-5\n10.1038/ncb0311-184\n10.1172/jci.insight.132747\n10.2147/OTT.S217041\n10.3390/cancers13112740\n10.1152/ajpheart.00056.2019\n10.1253/circj.cj-13-0835\n10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2018.32708\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.206094\n10.1007/s11764-011-0186-6\n10.1038/clpt.2013.201\n10.1056/NEJMoa1209124\n10.1002/tox.23509\n10.3389/fphar.2020.528267\n10.1016/j.bcp.2014.01.040\n10.1038/s41418-022-00990-5\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.09.024\n10.1111/j.1742-7843.2005.pto960112.x\n10.1124/mol.119.115725\n10.1126/sciadv.aax1346\n10.1016/j.fct.2009.02.007\n10.1038/s41392-021-00507-5\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.12.027\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw211\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101523\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120429\n10.1038/s41392-021-00613-4\n10.1038/nm.4017\n10.1124/jpet.114.219261\n10.1111/imr.12909\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.117186\n10.1101/gad.12.7.982"}

The underground parts of the plants are used in traditional medicine to manage epilepsy and other cardiovascular conditions.\nThe present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of a characterized hydroalcoholic extract (NJET) of Nardostachys jatamansi in the lithium-pilocarpine rat model of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and associated cardiac irregularities.\nNJET was prepared by percolation using 80% ethanol. The dried NEJT was subjected to UHPLC-qTOF-MS/MS for chemical characterization. Molecular docking studies were performed using the characterized compounds to understand mTOR interactions. The animals showing SRS following lithium-pilocarpine administration were treated with NJET for 6 weeks. Afterward, seizure severity, cardiac parameters, serum biochemistry, and histopathological parameters were studied. The cardiac tissue was processed for specific protein and gene expression studies.\nThe UHPLC-qTOF-MS/MS characterized 13 compounds in NJET. The identified compounds subjected to molecular docking showed promising binding affinities toward mTOR. There was a dose-dependent decrease in the severity of SRS following the extract administration. A reduction in mean arterial pressure and serum biochemical markers (lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase) was also observed following NJET treatment in epileptic animals. Histopathological investigations revealed reduced degenerative changes and decreased fibrosis following the extract treatment. The cardiac mRNA level of Mtor, Rps6, Hif1a, and Tgfb3 was reduced in the extract-treated groups. Further, a similar reduction in the protein expression of p-mTOR and HIF-1\u03b1 was also observed following NJET treatment in the cardiac tissue.\nThe results concluded that NJET treatment reduces lithium-pilocarpine-induced recurrent seizures and associated cardiac irregularities via downregulation of the mTOR signalling pathway.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2023-02-23", "authors": ["SupriyaSharma", "Anil KumarRana", "Shubham NilkanthRahmatkar", "VikramPatial", "DamanpreetSingh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2023.116280"}
{"title": "Costunolide alleviates hyperglycaemia-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy via inhibiting inflammatory responses and oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Hyperglycaemia-induced myocardial injury promotes the induction of heart failure in diabetic patients. Impaired antioxidant capability and sustained chronic inflammation play a vital role in the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Costunolide (Cos), a natural compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has exhibited therapeutic effects in various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of Cos in diabetes-induced myocardial injury remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of Cos on DCM and explored the potential mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice were administered intraperitoneal streptozotocin for DCM induction. Cos-mediated anti-inflammatory and antioxidation activities were examined in heart tissues of diabetic mice and high glucose (HG)-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Cos markedly inhibited HG-induced fibrotic responses in diabetic mice and H9c2 cells, respectively. The cardioprotective effects of Cos could be correlated to the reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress.

Its dripping pills were approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in 2003 and could be used in the clinical treatment of ischemic heart diseases. Ferroptosis is an important pathological mechanism in the process of myocardial ischemia (MI). Whether QSYQ can improve ferroptosis induced by myocardial ischemia is still unclear.\nIn this study, the potential mechanisms of QSYQ against ferroptosis in MI-induced injury were investigated.\nThe main components of QSYQ were analyzed by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. MI model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and then treated with QSYQ dropping pills for 14 days. The cardiac function of mice was evaluated by echocardiography. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Masson's trichrome staining were used to detect the pathological changes in heart tissue. Serum biochemical indexes were analyzed by biochemical kit. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe the mitochondria ultrastructure and mitochondrial ROS was detected by immunofluorescence. Then, photoacoustic imaging was used to observe the redox status of the mice' hearts. Finally, the mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis related proteins and the proteins of ferroptosis were analyzed by western blotting. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression changes of ferroptosis.\nA total of 20 principal components of QSYQ were characterized by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. QSYQ significantly improved cardiac function and myocardial injury in MI mice. Furthermore, the lipid peroxidation change levels (MDA, 4-HNE, and GSH) in serum were attenuated and myocardial iron content was reduced after QSYQ treatment. On this basis, QSYQ also improved the expression changes of ferroptosis related mRNA and proteins. In addition, QSYQ promoted mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1\u03b1, Nrf1, and TFAM) and mitochondrial fusion (MFN-2 and OPA1) and inhibited mitochondrial excessive fission (Phosphorylation of Drp1 at ser616) in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the cardioprotection of QSYQ might be related to promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamic homeostasis.\nIn summary, QSYQ could alleviate MI-induced ferroptosis by improving mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamic homeostasis.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2023-02-23", "authors": ["LinglingWu", "ZhaoyangFan", "LifeiGu", "JinchengLiu", "ZekunCui", "BoyangYu", "JunpingKou", "FangLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2023.116282"}

{"title": "Multi-Omic Architecture of Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Currently, hypertrophy pathways responsible for HCM have not been fully elucidated. Their identification could serve as a nidus for the generation of novel therapeutics aimed at halting disease development or progression. Herein, we performed a comprehensive multi-omic characterization of hypertrophy pathways in HCM.\nFlash-frozen cardiac tissues were collected from genotyped HCM patients (n=97) undergoing surgical myectomy and tissue from 23 controls. RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-enabled deep proteome and phosphoproteomic assessment were performed. Rigorous differential expression, gene set enrichment, and pathway analyses were performed to characterize HCM-mediated alterations with emphasis on hypertrophy pathways.\nWe identified transcriptional dysregulation with 1246 (8%) differentially expressed genes and elucidated downregulation of 10 hypertrophy pathways. Deep proteomic analysis identified 411 proteins (9%) that differed between HCM and controls with strong dysregulation of metabolic pathways. Seven hypertrophy pathways were upregulated with antagonistic upregulation of 5 of 10 hypertrophy pathways shown to be downregulated in the transcriptome. Most upregulated hypertrophy pathways encompassed the rat sarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. Phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrated hyperphosphorylation of the rat sarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase system suggesting activation of this signaling cascade. There was a common transcriptomic and proteomic profile regardless of genotype.\nAt time of surgical myectomy, the ventricular proteome, independent of genotype, reveals widespread upregulation and activation of hypertrophy pathways, mainly involving the rat sarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. In addition, there is a counterregulatory transcriptional downregulation of the same pathways. Rat sarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase activation may serve a crucial role in hypertrophy observed in HCM.", "journal": "Circulation.

Recent studies show that vascular cell metabolism affects atherogenesis and thrombogenicity. This study aimed to identify the metabolites in macrophage-rich unstable plaques that modulate atherogenesis and serve as potential markers of plaque instability. Atherosclerotic plaques were induced by balloon injury in the iliofemoral arteries of rabbits fed on a conventional or 0.5% cholesterol diet. At 3 months post-balloon injury, the arteries and cardiac tissues were subjected to histological, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and metabolomic analyses. The identified metabolite-related proteins were immunohistochemically analyzed in stable and unstable plaques from human coronary arteries. The factors modulating the identified metabolites were examined in macrophages derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Metabolomic analysis revealed that choline and guanine levels in macrophage-rich arteries were upregulated compared with those in non-injured arteries and cardiac tissues. Vascular choline levels, but not guanine levels, were positively correlated with the areas immunopositive for macrophages and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 mRNA levels in injured arteries. In human coronary arteries, choline transporter-like protein (CTL) 1 was mainly localized to macrophages within plaques. The area that was immunopositive for CTL1 in unstable plaques was significantly higher than that in stable plaques. Intracellular choline levels were upregulated upon stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 but were downregulated under hypoxia in cultured macrophages. Administration of choline upregulated the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and CTL1 mRNA in cultured macrophages. The transfection of CTL1 small interfering RNA decreased CTL1, TNF-\u03b1, and MMP9 mRNA levels in cultured macrophages. These results suggest that choline metabolism is altered in macrophage-rich atherosclerotic lesions and unstable plaques.

{"title": "Autonomic nervous system and cardiac neuro-signaling pathway modulation in cardiovascular disorders and Alzheimer's disease.", "abstract": "The heart is a functional syncytium controlled by a delicate and sophisticated balance ensured by the tight coordination of its several cell subpopulations. Accordingly, cardiomyocytes together with the surrounding microenvironment participate in the heart tissue homeostasis. In the right atrium, the sinoatrial nodal cells regulate the cardiac impulse propagation through cardiomyocytes, thus ensuring the maintenance of the electric network in the heart tissue. Notably, the central nervous system (CNS) modulates the cardiac rhythm through the two limbs of the autonomic nervous system (ANS): the parasympathetic and sympathetic compartments. The autonomic nervous system exerts non-voluntary effects on different peripheral organs. The main neuromodulator of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) is norepinephrine, while the principal neurotransmitter of the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) is acetylcholine. Through these two main neurohormones, the ANS can gradually regulate cardiac, vascular, visceral, and glandular functions by turning on one of its two branches (adrenergic and/or cholinergic), which exert opposite effects on targeted organs. Besides these neuromodulators, the cardiac nervous system is ruled by specific neuropeptides (neurotrophic factors) that help to preserve innervation homeostasis through the myocardial layers (from epicardium to endocardium). Interestingly, the dysregulation of this neuro-signaling pathway may expose the cardiac tissue to severe disorders of different etiology and nature. Specifically, a maladaptive remodeling of the cardiac nervous system may culminate in a progressive loss of neurotrophins, thus leading to severe myocardial denervation, as observed in different cardiometabolic and neurodegenerative diseases (myocardial infarction, heart failure, Alzheimer's disease). This review analyzes the current knowledge on the pathophysiological processes involved in cardiac nervous system impairment from the perspectives of both cardiac disorders and a widely diffused and devastating neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, proposing a relationship between neurodegeneration, loss of neurotrophic factors, and cardiac nervous system impairment. This overview is conducive to a more comprehensive understanding of the process of cardiac neuro-signaling dysfunction, while bringing to light potential therapeutic scenarios to correct or delay the

{"title": "Topological charge-density-vector method of identifying filaments of scroll waves.", "abstract": "Scroll waves have been found in a variety of three-dimensional excitable media, including physical, chemical, and biological origins. Scroll waves in cardiac tissue are of particular significance as they underlie ventricular fibrillation that can cause sudden death. The behavior of a scroll wave is characterized by a line of phase singularity at its organizing center, known as a filament. A thorough investigation into the filament dynamics is the key to further exploration of the general theory of scroll waves in excitable media and the mechanisms of ventricular fibrillation. In this paper, we propose a method to identify filaments of scroll waves in excitable media. From the definition of the topological charge of filaments, we obtain the discrete expression of the topological charge-density vector, which is useful in calculating the topological charge vectors at each grid in the space directly. The set of starting points of these topological charge vectors represents a set of phase singularities, thereby forming a line of phase singularity, that is, a filament of a scroll wave.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Reconstruction of three-dimensional scroll waves in excitable media from two-dimensional observations using deep neural networks.", "abstract": "Scroll wave dynamics are thought to underlie life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. However, direct observations of three-dimensional electrical scroll waves remain elusive, as there is no direct way to measure action potential wave patterns transmurally throughout the thick ventricular heart muscle. Here we study whether it is possible to reconstruct simulated scroll waves and scroll wave chaos using deep learning. We trained encoding-decoding convolutional neural networks to predict three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics inside bulk-shaped excitable media from two-dimensional observations of the wave dynamics on the bulk's surface. We tested whether observations from one or two opposing surfaces would be sufficient and whether transparency or measurements of surface deformations enhances the reconstruction. Further, we evaluated the approach's robustness against noise and tested the feasibility of predicting the bulk's thickness. We distinguished isotropic and anisotropic, as well as opaque and transparent, excitable media as models for cardiac tissue and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction, respectively. While we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics, we also show that it is challenging to reconstruct complicated scroll wave chaos and that prediction outcomes depend on various factors such as transparency, anisotropy, and ultimately the thickness of the medium compared to the size of the scroll waves. In particular, we found that anisotropy provides crucial information for neural networks to decode depth, which facilitates the reconstructions. In the future, deep neural networks could be used to visualize intramural action potential wave patterns from epi- or endocardial measurements.", "journal": "Physical review.

Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel-based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear-thinning and self-healing behavior. When encapsulating human-induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2023-02-17", "authors": ["YongcongFang", "YihanGuo", "BingyanWu", "ZiboLiu", "MinYe", "YuanyuanXu", "MengkeJi", "LiChen", "BingchuanLu", "KaijiNie", "ZixuanWang", "JianbinLuo", "TingZhang", "WeiSun", "ZhuoXiong"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202205082"}

Much is known about the factors that regulate initial differentiation of cardiomyocytes, and there is ongoing research to identify how these fetal and immature cardiomyocytes develop into fully functioning, mature cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that maturation limits proliferation and conversely proliferation occurs rarely in cardiomyocytes of the adult myocardium. We term this oppositional interplay the proliferation-maturation dichotomy.

Our prior studies demonstrate that cardiotoxicity from concurrent cardiac irradiation and anti-PD-1 administration in a mouse model is CD8+ T-cell dependent. The objective of this study was to determine whether humoral immunity contributed to the observed cardiac tissue damage, as measured by creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin 1 release and decline in cardiac function. In the current study, we demonstrate the presence of cardiac autoantibodies, which were essential for the occurrence of cardiotoxicity from the combined therapy. Mice subjected to cardiac irradiation, while being treated with anti-PD-1, developed high levels of antibodies that reacted with cardiac tissues in vivo and cardiac antigens in vitro. Moreover, mice deficient in B cells were protected against cardiotoxicity, whereas the transfer of autoantibody-containing sera from mice that had received combined treatment reproduced the same pathologic phenotype in mice exposed to cardiac irradiation but was not observed in normal recipients. The cardiotoxic effect of the sera, which associated with CD8+ T-cell accumulation in cardiac tissue, was limited by IgG depletion. In conclusion, concurrent cardiac irradiation and PD-1 blockade leads to production of cardiac autoantibodies, likely due to antigen exposure within the irradiated cardiac tissues, which play a key role in the resulting cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Cancer immunology research", "date": "2023-02-16", "authors": ["BoYan", "D CraigHooper", "ZhiyongYuan", "ChangliWang", "YulongChen", "BoLu"], "doi": "10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0839"}

{"title": "Therapeutic Hypothermia Inhibits Hypoxia-Induced Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis\u00a0Via the MiR-483-3p/Cdk9 Axis.", "abstract": "Background Therapeutic hypothermia has a beneficial effect on cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. Recent research has suggested that microRNAs participate in acute myocardial infarction to regulate cardiomyocyte survival. This study aimed to explore the ability of hypothermia-regulated microRNA-483-3p (miR-483-3p) to inhibit hypoxia-induced myocardial infarction. Methods and Results Primary cardiomyocytes were cultured under hypoxia at 32 \u00b0C to mimic therapeutic hypothermia, and the differentially expressed microRNAs were determined by RNA sequencing. Therapeutic hypothermia recovered hypoxia-induced increases in apoptosis, decreases in ATP levels, and decreases in miR-483-3p expression. Overexpression of miR-483-3p exhibited effects similar to those of therapeutic hypothermia on hypoxia in the treatment of cardiomyocytes to associate with maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential, and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) was identified as a target gene with downregulated expression by miR-483-3p.

{"title": "Impact of Reperfusion on Temporal Immune Cell Dynamics After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Excessive inflammation and impaired healing of cardiac tissue following a myocardial infarction (MI) can drive the development of heart failure. Cardiac repair begins immediately after the onset of MI and continues for months. The repair process can be divided into the following 3 overlapping phases, each having distinct functions and sequelae: the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase, and the maturation phase. Macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes are present in the myocardium throughout the repair process and govern the duration and function of each of these phases. However, changes in the functions of these cell types across each phase are poorly characterized. Numerous immunomodulatory therapies that specifically target inflammation have been developed for promoting cardiac repair and preventing heart failure after MI. However, these treatments have been largely unsuccessful in large-scale clinical randomized controlled trials. A potential explanation for this failure is the lack of a thorough understanding of the time-dependent evolution of the functions of immune cells after a major cardiovascular event. Failure to account for this temporal plasticity in cell function may reduce the efficacy of immunomodulatory approaches that target cardiac repair. This review is concerned with how the functions of different immune cells change with time following an MI. Improved understanding of the temporal changes in immune cell function is important for the future development of effective and targeted treatments for preventing heart failure after MI.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2023-02-16", "authors": ["Richard Ying KeZhang", "Blake JCochran", "Shane RThomas", "Kerry-AnneRye"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.122.027600\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.069\n10.3390/ijms21030807\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.023\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1016/0735-1097(93)90700-B\n10.1159/000489241\n10.1084/jem.20170689\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv195\n10.1096/fj.202100240R\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht331\n10.1007/s00428-013-1447-8\n10.7554/eLife.66808\n10.1038/nri.2017.28\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314028\n10.1038/s41590-018-0272-2\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.11.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303567\n10.1038/s41401-018-0197-1\n10.1096/fj.12-214049\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311327\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.000731\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.10.022\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310260\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315807\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036044\n10.1172/JCI99659\n10.1093/cvr/cvz040\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.07.085\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301198\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.10.001\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.06.006\n10.1038/s41591-018-0059-x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.036\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309001\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.02.116\n10.1371/journal.pone.0039484\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.033942\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.039262\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz461\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304944\n10.1007/s00395-019-0740-3\n10.1038/s41598-019-52671-y\n10.1161/JAHA.120.018993\n10.3389/fcell.2020.564169\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa733\n10.1038/ncomms14780\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003653\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00187-X\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101292\n10.1371/journal.pone.0115828\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043833\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.07.105\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310870\n10.3390/ijms22020722\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305628\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa312\n10.1093/cvr/cvab269\n10.1084/jem.20210008\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.09.085\n10.1007/s00395-019-0746-x\n10.1093/cvr/cvw024\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.10.008\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp088\n10.1002/ehf2.13539\n10.1002/ejhf.242\n10.1172/JCI80055\n10.1177/0003319715583204\n10.1016/j.molimm.2018.05.015\n10.1038/cmi.2014.74\n10.1111/apm.13094\n10.1056/NEJMoa1505489\n10.1038/nm.3284\n10.1042/CS20140672\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023106\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.044581\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.079\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.046789\n10.1152/ajpheart.00328.2014\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.649244\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023365\n10.1172/JCI123859\n10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107490\n10.1038/s41467-021-21737-9\n10.1042/BSR20203413\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.116.003688\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036065\n10.1042/CS20110561\n10.1161/JAHA.114.000839\n10.1093/eurjhf/hft054\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.052126\n10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.115.002554\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001876\n10.1038/s41467-020-19297-5\n10.1172/JCI136778\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110358\n10.1056/NEJMoa1707914\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32814-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038010\n10.1016/j.jchf.2013.11.006\n10.1056/NEJMoa1912388\n10.1002/ehf2.12681\n10.1093/cvr/cvab113\n10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022826\n10.1093/cvr/cvu225\n10.1093/cvr/cvaa155\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.066\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.09.008"}
{"title": "Flaxseed lignans alleviates isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy by regulating myocardial remodeling and oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, the leading global cause of death, are usually associated with cardiac hypertrophy (CH). CH is an adaptive response of the heart against cardiac overloading, but continuous CH accelerates cardiac remodeling and results in heart failure. Available CH therapies delay the progress of heart failure, but they often fail to control symptoms or restore quality of life. Although flaxseed lignans have been shown to have significant anti-oxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects in various cardiovascular diseases, little is known about their effect on CH. Thus, this study evaluated the therapeutic effect of flaxseed lignans on CH, which was induced by subcutaneous injections with isoproterenol (5 mg/kg b.w) for 14 consecutive days. Flaxseed lignans (200 mg/kg) was given orally for 4\u00a0weeks. Cardiac pathological remodeling was evaluated by echocardiography, after which morphometric, biochemical, histological, and ultrastructural analyses were performed. Flaxseed lignans significantly ameliorated CH structural and functional alterations as shown by echocardiography. Lignans also reduced the relative heart weight, significantly decreased the elevated CK-MB and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde, augmented the myocardial total antioxidant capacity, and ameliorated the histopathological and ultrastructural changes in cardiac tissues and prevented interstitial collagen deposition. The results demonstrate promising anti-hypertrophic effect of flaxseed lignans against isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, via regulating myocardial remodeling and oxidative stress. Therefore, lignans could be used as potential pharmacological intervention in the management of CH.", "journal": "Ultrastructural pathology", "date": "2023-02-16", "authors": ["Sanaa HElsayed", "Nagui HFares", "Samar HElsharkawy", "Yomna IMahmoud"], "doi": "10.1080/01913123.2023.2175944"}

{"title": "Dectin-1 Acts as a Non-Classical Receptor of Ang II to Induce Cardiac Remodeling.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodeling in heart failure involves macrophage-mediated immune responses. Recent studies have shown that a PRR (pattern recognition receptor) called dectin-1, expressed on macrophages, mediates proinflammatory responses. Whether dectin-1 plays a role in pathological cardiac remodeling is unknown. Here, we identified a potential role of dectin-1 in this disease.\nTo model aberrant cardiac remodeling, we utilized mouse models of chronic Ang II (angiotensin II) infusion. In this model, we assessed the potential role of dectin-1 through using D1KO (dectin-1 knockout) mice and bone marrow transplantation chimeric mice. We then used cellular and molecular assays to discover the underlying mechanisms of dectin-1 function.\nWe found that macrophage dectin-1 is elevated in mouse heart tissues following chronic Ang II administration. D1KO mice were significantly protected against Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammatory responses, and macrophage infiltration. Further bone marrow transplantation studies showed that dectin-1 deficiency in bone marrow-derived cells prevented Ang II-induced cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. Through detailed molecular studies, we show that Ang II binds directly to dectin-1, causing dectin-1 homodimerization and activating the downstream Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase)/NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling pathway to induce expression of inflammatory and chemoattractant factors. Mutagenesis studies identified R184 in the C-type lectin domain to interact with Ang II. Blocking dectin-1 in macrophages suppresses Ang II-induced inflammatory mediators and subsequent intercellular cross talk with cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts.\nOur study has discovered dectin-1 as a new nonclassical receptor of Ang II and a key player in cardiac remolding and dysfunction.

Herein, the authors demonstrate an electric-field-driven (EFD) printed 3D highly ordered microstructure with cell feature size to promote the maturation of ECTs. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the EFD jet microscale 3D printing overcomes the jet repulsion without any prior requirements for both conductive and insulating substrates. Furthermore, the 3D highly ordered microstructures with a fiber diameter of 10-20\u00a0\u00b5m and spacing of 60-80\u00a0\u00b5m have been fabricated by maintaining a vertical jet, achieving the largest ratio of fiber diameter/spacing of 0.29. The hiPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes formed ordered ECTs with their sarcomere growth along the fiber and developed synchronous functional ECTs inside the 3D-printed scaffold with matured calcium handling compared to the 2D coverslip.

{"title": "Effect of acute cold exposure on cardiac mitochondrial function: role of sirtuins.", "abstract": "Cardiac function depends mainly on mitochondrial metabolism. Cold conditions increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by increasing blood pressure. Adaptive thermogenesis leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and function in skeletal muscles and adipocytes. Here, we studied the effect of acute cold exposure on cardiac mitochondrial function and its regulation by sirtuins. Significant increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number as measured by the ratio between mitochondrial-coded COX-II and nuclear-coded cyclophilin A gene expression by qRT-PCR and increase in the expression of PGC-1\u03b1, a mitochondriogenic factor and its downstream target NRF-1 were observed on cold exposure. This was associated with an increase in the activity of SIRT-1, which is known to activate PGC-1\u03b1. Mitochondrial SIRT-3 was also upregulated. Increase in sirtuin activity was reflected in total protein acetylome, which decreased in cold-exposed cardiac tissue. An increase in mitochondrial MnSOD further indicated enhanced mitochondrial function. Further evidence for this was obtained from ex vivo studies of cardiac tissue treated with norepinephrine, which caused a significant increase in mitochondrial MnSOD and SIRT-3. SIRT-3 appears to mediate the regulation of MnSOD, as treatment with AGK-7, a SIRT-3 inhibitor reversed the norepinephrine-induced upregulation of MnSOD. It, therefore, appears that SIRT-3 activation in response to SIRT-1-PGC-1\u03b1 activation contributes to the regulation of cardiac mitochondrial activity during acute cold exposure.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2023-02-14", "authors": ["Mithra SMohan", "S SAswani", "N SAparna", "P TBoban", "P RSudhakaran", "KSaja"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-022-04656-1\n10.4103/1947-2714.110430\n10.1152/ajpheart.00199.2015\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.02.034\n10.1289/ehp.1408104\n10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017398\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.212\n10.1159/000139254\n10.1016/s0031-9384(98)00250-9\n10.1016/S0306-4565(99)00085-6\n10.1152/jappl.1989.66.2.741\n10.1016/S0306-4565(01)00071-7\n10.1016/s0895-7061(01)02230-0\n10.1016/j.mito.2020.06.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0228166\n10.1042/bse0470069\n10.1073/pnas.91.4.1309\n10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81410-5\n10.1093/cvr/cvm005\n10.1146/annurev.pathol.4.110807.092250\n10.1016/j.tem.2013.12.001\n10.1161/circresaha.118.312498\n10.1007/s13105-016-0492-6\n10.1038/nature03354\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.016\n10.1172/jci39162\n10.18632/aging.100252\n10.1128/mcb.00586-15\n10.18632/aging.100544\n10.1089/ars.2013.5482\n10.18632/aging.100075\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011707\n10.1016/0968-0004(90)90194-g\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2003\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1954.177.3.372\n10.3181/00379727-92-22632\n10.1152/jappl.1956.9.3.399\n10.1152/jappl.1956.9.3.404\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1957.190.2.243\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1957.190.2.247\n10.1152/jappl.1991.71.1.300\n10.20463/jenb.2017.0020\n10.1074/jbc.m414670200\n10.1080/23328940.2017.1414014\n10.1016/0019-2791(71)90454-x\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1875-1_3\n10.1074/jbc.m108923200\n10.1007/s00253-012-4672-1\n10.1038/227680a0\n10.1073/pnas.76.9.4350\n10.1038/nprot.2017.139\n10.1007/s10522-011-9342-7\n10.1016/j.cmet.2010.11.015\n10.1038/embor.2011.65\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.06.020\n10.1038/35007527\n10.3389/fendo.2011.00102\n10.1016/j.cmet.2014.12.009\n10.1210/er.2002-0012\n10.1111/jcmm.15194\n10.1002/jcb.21625\n10.1016/s0960-9822(00)80008-1\n10.1017/s1751731117002981\n10.1152/ajpcell.00070.2009\n10.3945/ajcn.110.001917\n10.1073/pnas.0705070104\n10.1126/science.286.5443.1368\n10.1016/j.cmet.2006.04.013\n10.1073/pnas.0808207105\n10.5717/jenb.2014.18.1.1\n10.1113/jphysiol.2007.128652\n10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.005\n10.1002/1873-3468.13779\n10.11613/bm.2014.026\n10.1128/mcb.01636-07\n10.1016/j.molcel.2012.10.024\n10.1101/sqb.2011.76.010850\n10.1074/jbc.m117.778720\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.03.009\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.07.012\n10.1042/BJ20081386\n10.1002/jcp.27370\n10.1155/2012/403870\n10.1097/00007890-198804000-00001\n10.1016/0891-5849(94)90124-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00811.2003\n10.1016/j.arres.2021.100027\n10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2022.111745"}

This study investigated that PGAM5 expression levels in heart failure and its underlying mechanisms in vivo and in vitro.\nThe inhibition of PGAM5 mRNA expression levels in patients with heart failure was compared with the normal group.\nThe serum of PGAM5 mRNA expression was negative correlation with collagen I and collagen III in patients with heart failure. PGAM5 mRNA and protein expression in the heart tissue of mice with heart failure were down-regulated at a time-dependent rate. The inhibition of PGAM5 presented heart failure in the model. PGAM5 reduced inflammation and inhibited ROS-induced oxidative stress in models of heart failure. PGAM5 reduced Ferroptosis in models of heart failure. PGAM5 regulated Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. IP also showed that PGAM5 protein combined with the Keap1 protein. PGAM5 could increase Keap1 protein ubiquitination. Keap1 inhibition affected the effects of PGAM5 in model of heart failure.\nWe conclude that the protection of PGAM5 reduced ROS-induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis by the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in heart failure, suggesting that targeting this mechanism of PGAM5 may be a feasible strategy to treat heart failure.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)", "date": "2023-02-14", "authors": ["ShuangfeiLi", "PingWen", "DayongZhang", "DecaiLi", "QidongGao", "HongLiu", "YunfengDi"], "doi": "10.1080/10641963.2022.2162537"}
{"title": "Impact of blood factors on endothelial cell metabolism and function in two diverse heart failure models.", "abstract": "Role of blood-based factors in development and progression of heart failure (HF) is poorly characterized. Blood contains factors released during pathophysiological states that may impact cellular function and provide mechanistic insights to HF management. We tested effects of blood from two distinct HF models on cardiac metabolism and identified possible cellular targets of the effects. Blood plasma was obtained from daunorubicin- and myocardial infarction-induced HF rabbits (Dauno-HF and MI-HF) and their controls (Dauno-Control and MI-Control). Effects of plasma on bioenergetics of myocardial tissue from healthy mice and cellular cardiac components were assessed using high-resolution respirometry and Seahorse flux analyzer. Since endothelial cell respiration was profoundly affected by HF plasma, effects of plasma on endothelial cell barrier function and death were further evaluated. Western-blotting and electron microscopy were performed to evaluate mitochondrial proteins and morphology. Brief exposure to HF plasma decreased cardiac tissue respiration. Endothelial cell respiration was most impacted by exposure to HF plasma. Endothelial cell monolayer integrity was decreased by incubation with Dauno-HF plasma. Apoptosis and necrosis were increased in cells incubated with Dauno-HF plasma for 24 h. Down-regulation of voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC)-1, translocase of outer membrane 20 (Tom20), and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) in cells exposed to Dauno-HF plasma and mitochondrial signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and MFF in cells exposed to MI-HF plasma were observed. Mitochondrial structure was disrupted in cells exposed to HF plasma. These findings indicate that endothelial cells and mitochondrial structure and function may be primary target where HF pathology manifests and accelerates.

Detailed mechanism of action of these agents can help predict potential unwanted affects and identify patient populations that can benefit most from them. Danicamtiv is a novel myosin activator with promising preclinical data that is currently in clinical trials. While it is known danicamtiv increases force and cardiomyocyte contractility without affecting calcium levels, detailed mechanistic studies regarding its mode of action are lacking. Using porcine cardiac tissue and myofibrils we demonstrate that Danicamtiv increases force and calcium sensitivity via increasing the number of myosin in the \"on\" state and slowing cross bridge turnover. Our detailed analysis shows that inhibition of ADP release results in decreased cross bridge turnover with cross bridges staying on longer and prolonging myofibril relaxation. Using a mouse model of genetic dilated cardiomyopathy, we demonstrated that Danicamtiv corrected calcium sensitivity in demembranated and abnormal twitch magnitude and kinetics in intact cardiac tissue.\nDirectly augmenting sarcomere function has potential to overcome limitations of currently used inotropic agents to improve cardiac contractility. Myosin modulation is a novel mechanism for increased contraction in cardiomyopathies. Danicamtiv is a myosin activator that is currently under investigation for use in cardiomyopathy patients.

Western blot showed that SSYX decreased the protein expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 and increased the protein expression of occludin, ZO-1, eNOS, and Cx43. SSYX also increased the content of NO, decreased ET-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, and CCR-2 mRNA expression, and increased Kv 4.2, Kv 4.3, Cav 1.2, and Nav 1.5 mRNA expression. Furthermore, SSYX decreased the fluorescence intensity of F4/80 and iNOS, increased the fluorescence intensity of CD31 and eNOS, and improved the Cx43 and \u03b1-actinin connection structure in cardiac tissues. The above therapeutic effects of SSYX were inhibited by L-NAME.\nSSYX reduced the susceptibility of db/db mice to arrhythmia by inhibiting the inflammatory response and macrophage polarization, and this effect of SSYX occurred through protection of endothelial cell function.", "journal": "Drug design, development and therapy", "date": "2023-02-14", "authors": ["JiehanZhang", "HongrongLi", "DandongWang", "JiaojiaoGu", "YunlongHou", "YilingWu"], "doi": "10.2147/DDDT.S392328\n10.1097/MD.0000000000013599\n10.1093/europace/euw198\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000145\n10.1016/j.tcm.2015.07.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2005.07.009\n10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.11.005\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312836\n10.1038/s41569-021-00520-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.031\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.7150/thno.34801\n10.1152/ajpheart.00249.2019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309732\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.746151\n10.1016/j.imbio.2018.11.010\n10.1111/1753-0407.12521\n10.1007/s11655-018-2578-1\n10.1007/s11596-016-1560-4\n10.3389/fphar.2020.00993\n10.3892/mmr.2015.4598\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.09.035\n10.2147/DDDT.S182834\n10.4103/0366-6999.197997\n10.1097/00029330-200706020-00008\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154086\n10.1111/apha.13444\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.08.019\n10.1097/CRD.0000000000000140\n10.1074/jbc.273.45.29745\n10.1016/j.addr.2005.01.009\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.07.017\n10.1371/journal.pone.0230358\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.733808\n10.1155/2012/146154\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.05.018\n10.1007/s00018-008-8080-8"}
{"title": "NSC228155 alleviates septic cardiomyopathy via protecting mitochondria and inhibiting inflammation.", "abstract": "Septic cardiomyopathy is a lethal symptom of sepsis. Discovery of effective therapy that prevents cardiac injury in sepsis is critical in the clinical management of sepsis. NSC228155 is a novel compound with therapeutic potential on acute kidney injury by preventing apoptosis and protecting mitochondria. Whether NSC228155 protects against septic cardiomyopathy is unclear. In the present study, adult C57BL/6J mice were i.p injected with 5\u00a0mg/kg/day NSC228155 for 2\u00a0days before 10\u00a0mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Cardiac functional testing and sampling for serum and tissue were performed 12 and 24\u00a0h post LPS injection, respectively. NSC228155 significantly improved cardiac function examined by echocardiography, decreased the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB, and pathologically alleviated cardiac injury in LPS mice. Accordingly, NSC228155 attenuated cardiomyocytes' mitochondrial damage as shown by decreased damaged mitochondrial ratio and activated signals for mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and mitophagy in LPS mice model. Metabolomics analysis demonstrated that NSC228155 corrected the metabolic disturbance involved in oxidative stress and energy metabolism, and decreased tissue injury metabolites in LPS-stimulated cardiac tissue. In the LPS-stimulated cardiac cell culture derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, NSC228155 effectively restored the beating frequency, decreased LDH release, and protected mitochondria. NSC228155 also inhibited inflammation shown by decreased pro-inflammatory mediators in both serum and cardiac tissue in LPS model. Taken together, NSC228155 significantly improved cardiac function by directly preventing against cardiac cell injury and inhibiting inflammation in LPS model, hence may be a potential novel therapy against septic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "International immunopharmacology", "date": "2023-02-13", "authors": ["YutengJiang", "YanweiLi", "YiyuanZhang", "DandanHu", "ShengnanZhang", "ChunliWang", "SongmingHuang", "AihuaZhang", "ZhanjunJia", "RanYou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109847"}

However, the role of B cells in cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration has not been clarified. Here, we found that the neonatal mice with B cell depletion showed markedly reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation, leading to cardiac dysfunction, fibrosis scar formation, and the complete failure of heart regeneration after apical resection. B cell depletion also significantly impaired heart regeneration and cardiac function in neonatal mice following myocardial infarction (MI). However, B cell depletion in adult mice suppressed tissue inflammation, inhibited myocardial fibrosis, and improved cardiac function after MI. Interestingly, B cell depletion partially restricted cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult mice post-MI. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that cardiac B cells possessed a more powerful ability to inhibit inflammatory responses and enhance angiogenesis in the postnatal day 1 (P1) mice compared with P7 and adult mice. Besides, the proportion of cardioprotective B cell clusters with high expression levels of S100a6 (S100 calcium-binding protein A6) and S100a4 (S100 calcium-binding protein A4) was greatly decreased in adult heart tissues compared with neonatal mice after cardiac damage.

{"title": "Unveiling IL-33/ST2 Pathway Unbalance in Cardiac Remodeling Due to Obesity in Zucker Fatty Rats.", "abstract": "Obesity is an epidemic condition linked to cardiovascular disease severity and mortality. Fat localization and type represent cardiovascular risk estimators. Importantly, visceral fat secretes adipokines known to promote low-grade inflammation that, in turn, modulate its secretome and cardiac metabolism. In this regard, IL-33 regulates the functions of various immune cells through ST2 binding and-following its role as an immune sensor to infection and stress-is involved in the pro-fibrotic remodeling of the myocardium. Here we further investigated the IL-33/ST2 effects on cardiac remodeling in obesity, focusing on molecular pathways linking adipose-derived IL-33 to the development of fibrosis or hypertrophy. We analyzed the Zucker Fatty rat model, and we developed in vitro models to mimic the adipose and myocardial relationship. We demonstrated a dysregulation of IL-33/ST2 signaling in both adipose and cardiac tissue, where they affected Epac proteins and myocardial gene expression, linked to pro-fibrotic signatures. In Zucker rats, pro-fibrotic effects were counteracted by ghrelin-induced IL-33 secretion, whose release influenced transcription factor expression and ST2 isoforms balance regulation.

{"title": "Actin-Cytoskeleton Drives Caveolae Signaling to Mitochondria during Postconditioning.", "abstract": "Caveolae-associated signaling toward mitochondria contributes to the cardioprotective mechanisms against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by ischemic postconditioning. In this work, we evaluated the role that the actin-cytoskeleton network exerts on caveolae-mitochondria communication during postconditioning. Isolated rat hearts subjected to I/R and to postconditioning were treated with latrunculin A, a cytoskeleton disruptor. Cardiac function was compared between these hearts and those exposed only to I/R and to the cardioprotective maneuver. Caveolae and mitochondria structures were determined by electron microscopy and maintenance of the actin-cytoskeleton was evaluated by phalloidin staining. Caveolin-3 and other putative caveolae-conforming proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. Co-expression of caveolin-3 and actin was evaluated both in lipid raft fractions and in heart tissue from the different groups. Mitochondrial function was assessed by respirometry and correlated with cholesterol levels. Treatment with latrunculin A abolishes the cardioprotective postconditioning effect, inducing morphological and structural changes in cardiac tissue, reducing F-actin staining and diminishing caveolae formation. Latrunculin A administration to post-conditioned hearts decreases the interaction between caveolae-forming proteins, the co-localization of caveolin with actin and inhibits oxygen consumption rates in both subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar mitochondria. We conclude that actin-cytoskeleton drives caveolae signaling to mitochondria during postconditioning, supporting their functional integrity and contributing to cardiac adaption against reperfusion injury.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2023-02-12", "authors": ["FranciscoCorrea", "CristinaEnr\u00edquez-Cortina", "AlejandroSilva-Palacios", "NadiaRom\u00e1n-Anguiano", "AuroraGil-Hern\u00e1ndez", "MarcosOstolga-Chavarr\u00eda", "ElizabethSoria-Castro", "SharikHern\u00e1ndez-Rizo", "Paolade Los Heros", "Mar\u00edaCh\u00e1vez-Canales", "CeciliaZazueta"], "doi": "10.3390/cells12030492\n10.1152/ajplung.1998.275.5.L843\n10.1074/jbc.271.25.15160\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.12.014\n10.1091/mbc.11.1.325\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305348\n10.1016/j.biocel.2005.09.017\n10.4149/gpb_2018013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00520.2008\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.04.037\n10.1093/cvr/cvv044\n10.1007/s00395-017-0607-4\n10.1038/nrm1437\n10.1074/jbc.M602577200\n10.15252/embr.201439267\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2013.01.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.257964\n10.1016/S0021-9258(19)52451-6\n10.1016/S0022-2275(20)36896-6\n10.1038/nrm.2017.16\n10.1016/j.devcel.2005.11.005\n10.1002/pmic.200500208\n10.1371/journal.pone.0154151\n10.1126/science.1069784\n10.1074/jbc.M707890200\n10.7554/eLife.00905\n10.1042/BST20190386\n10.1016/j.ceb.2021.01.009\n10.1016/j.cub.2017.07.047\n10.1038/nature06173\n10.7554/eLife.29854\n10.1083/jcb.148.5.1047\n10.1242/jcs.084319\n10.1096/fj.14-252320\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116942\n10.3390/cells9010222\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.04.079\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.02.014"}

{"title": "Membrane Remodeling of Human-Engineered Cardiac Tissue by Chronic Electric Stimulation.", "abstract": "Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) show immature features, but these are improved by integration into 3D cardiac constructs. In addition, it has been demonstrated that physical manipulations such as electrical stimulation (ES) are highly effective in improving the maturation of human-engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) derived from hiPSC-CMs. Here, we continuously applied an ES in capacitive coupling configuration, which is below the pacing threshold, to millimeter-sized hECTs for 1-2 weeks. Meanwhile, the structural and functional developments of the hECTs were monitored and measured using an array of assays. Of particular note, a nanoscale imaging technique, scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), has been used to directly image membrane remodeling of CMs at different locations on the tissue surface. Periodic crest/valley patterns with a distance close to the sarcomere length appeared on the membrane of CMs near the edge of the tissue after ES, suggesting the enhanced transverse tubulation network.

Dexmedetomidine (Dex) has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of myocardial infarction, however, its underlying mechanism for regulating I/R injury is unclear.\nH9c2 cell and rat models of I/R injury were established via oxygen-glucose deprivation reoxygenation (OGD/R) and occlusion of the left anterior descending branch of coronary artery, respectively. Flow cytometry, MTT, or DHE assay detected cell activity, ROS, or apoptosis, respectively. The expression levels of miR-34b-3p and related mRNAs were determined using qRT-PCR. Related protein expression levels were detected by Western blotting and ELISA test. The interaction between miR-34b-3p and Jagged1 was assessed by dual luciferase reporter and RIP assays. The morphology of cardiac tissue was examined by TTC, HE, and TUNEL labeling.\nDex markedly inhibited the inflammatory damage and apoptosis caused by OGD/R in H9c2 cells. MiR-34b-3p and Jagged1 levels were increased and decreased in myocardial I/R injury model, respectively, while Dex reversed this effect. Moreover, miR-34b-3p was firstly reported to directly bind and decrease Jagged1 expression, thereby inhibiting Notch signaling pathway. Transfection of agomiR-34b-3p or Jagged1 silencing eliminated Dex's defensive impact on OGD/R-induced cardiomyocytes damage. Dex relieved the myocardial I/R injury of rats via inhibiting miR-34b-3p and further activating Notch signaling pathway.\nDex protected myocardium from I/R injury via suppressing miR-34b-3p to activate Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling pathway.

{"title": "Recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays a protective role in mice with sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction through multiple signaling pathways dependent on converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7.", "abstract": "Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction (SICD) is a common complication of sepsis and contributes to mortality and the complexity of management in patients with sepsis. Recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) has been reported to protect the heart from injury and dysfunction in conditions which involve increased angiotensin II (Ang II). In this study, we aimed to detect the effects of rhACE2 on SICD.\nA SICD model was developed in male C57/B6 mice by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal injection. When cardiac dysfunction was confirmed by echocardiography 3 hours after LPS administration, mice were treated with either saline, rhACE2, or rhACE2 + A779. All mice received echocardiographic examination at 6 hours after LPS injection and then were sacrificed for serum and myocardial tissues collection. Angiotensin, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and inflammatory markers in serum were measured. Histopathology features were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining to evaluate structure injury and cell pyroptosis rate in heart tissue respectively. Pyroptosis-related proteins and signaling pathways involved in nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in heart tissue were investigated by western blot (WB).\nRhACE2 relieved myocardial injury and improved cardiac function in mice with SICD accompanied by decrease of Ang II and increase of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) in serum. RhACE2 diminished activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, inflammatory response, and cell pyroptosis induced by LPS. In addition, rhACE2 partly inhibited activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and promoted activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase-\u03b11 (AMPK-\u03b11) pathway in heart tissue. Administration of A779 offset the inhibitive effects of rhACE2 on NLRP3 expression and protective role on cardiac injury and dysfunction in mice with SICD.\nRhACE2 plays a protective role in SICD, ameliorating cardiac injury and dysfunction through NF-\u03baB, p38 MAPK, and the AMPK-\u03b11/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway dependent on converting Ang II to Ang 1-7.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2023-02-11", "authors": ["ChunxueWu", "YuhongChen", "PanZhou", "ZhenjieHu"], "doi": "10.21037/atm-22-6016\n10.1001/jama.2016.0287\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000004155\n10.1186/s13054-021-03762-8\n10.1186/s13054-019-2478-6\n10.1007/s00134-020-06106-2\n10.1001/jama.2019.9021\n10.1186/s13054-020-02950-2\n10.1038/s41569-020-00492-2\n10.1186/s13054-018-2043-8\n10.7326/0003-4819-113-3-227\n10.1016/j.ccc.2018.11.002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00426.2008\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2003.10.009\n10.1681/ASN.2016101066\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.00143\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.03.080\n10.1530/JOE-12-0341\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317015\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.307708\n10.1016/j.peptides.2006.03.025\n10.1152/ajprenal.00477.2006\n10.1016/j.jss.2013.08.004\n10.1007/s40262-013-0072-7\n10.1186/s13054-017-1823-x\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.00036\n10.1002/jcsm.12763\n10.1038/s41598-017-13305-3\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101215\n10.21037/atm-22-483\n10.1038/nature03712\n10.1177/1753425918785008\n10.1080/21655979.2021.1995994\n10.1155/2017/5350161\n10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.01.018\n10.1161/01.CIR.75.3.533\n10.1186/cc8887\n10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105916\n10.1084/jem.183.3.949\n10.1186/s40635-017-0134-5\n10.1161/01.RES.87.3.241\n10.1007/978-981-10-4397-0_7\n10.1097/MCC.0b013e3283307a4e\n10.1096/fj.04-2519fje\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000261\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181f204ca\n10.1186/s13613-021-00893-7\n10.3390/ijerph18147598\n10.1007/s00134-001-1181-6\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.774193\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001901\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.711939\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.08.009\n10.1042/CS20200478\n10.1016/S1050-1738(02)00233-5\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105409\n10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100767\n10.1007/s11886-020-01277-2\n10.1155/2022/3277274\n10.2174/092986612802762714\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.014\n10.1016/j.abb.2020.108611\n10.1152/physrev.00022.2018\n10.18632/aging.202143\n10.1002/ehf2.13845\n10.1038/s41423-021-00670-3\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101523\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.02.043\n10.1111/apha.12376\n10.18632/oncotarget.15595\n10.1038/nature00786\n10.1001/jama.2020.11301\n10.1007/s00011-018-1160-9\n10.1038/s41401-021-00703-7\n10.1111/bph.12159\n10.1002/jcp.27267\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000215289.51180.5c\n10.1016/j.jash.2008.05.003\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.100693\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00227.2003\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.07.013\n10.1002/jcp.30527\n10.4049/jimmunol.0901363\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.07.003\n10.1084/jem.20172063\n10.1172/JCI78253\n10.1160/TH07-01-0052\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.620238\n10.1073/pnas.0708647105\n10.1038/sj.ki.5001509\n10.1159/000460837\n10.1007/s12640-021-00435-w\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.02.011\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.00210\n10.2337/db15-0399\n10.1016/j.regpep.2012.05.093\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004\n10.1097/SHK.0b013e31824c3238\n10.4049/jimmunol.0900138\n10.1093/cvr/cvt091\n10.1073/pnas.1108586108\n10.1007/s00395-014-0415-z\n10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317381\n10.1016/j.chest.2020.12.016"}
{"title": "RhoA rescues cardiac senescence by regulating Parkin-mediated mitophagy.", "abstract": "Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. RhoA, a small GTPase, governs actin dynamics in various tissue and cell types, including cardiomyocytes; however, its involvement in cardiac function has not been fully elucidated. Here, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific RhoA conditional knockout (cKO) mice, which demonstrated a significantly shorter lifespan with left ventricular dilation and severely impaired ejection fraction. We found that the cardiac tissues of the cKO mice exhibited structural disorganization with fibrosis and also exhibited enhanced senescence compared with control mice. In addition, we show that cardiomyocyte mitochondria were structurally abnormal in the aged cKO hearts. Clearance of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy was remarkably inhibited in both cKO cardiomyocytes and RhoA-knockdown HL-1 cultured cardiomyocytes. In RhoA-depleted cardiomyocytes, we reveal that the expression of Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in mitophagy, was reduced, and expression of N-Myc, a negative regulator of Parkin, was increased. We further reveal that the RhoA-Rho kinase axis induced N-Myc phosphorylation, which led to N-Myc degradation and Parkin upregulation. Re-expression of Parkin in RhoA-depleted cardiomyocytes restored mitophagy, reduced mitochondrial damage, attenuated cardiomyocyte senescence, and rescued cardiac function both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we found that patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy without causal mutations for dilated cardiomyopathy showed reduced cardiac expression of RhoA and Parkin. These results suggest that RhoA promotes Parkin-mediated mitophagy as an indispensable mechanism contributing to cardioprotection in the aging heart.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2023-02-10", "authors": ["Joanne Ern ChiSoh", "AkioShimizu", "Md RaselMolla", "Dimitar PZankov", "Le Kim ChiNguyen", "Mahbubur RahmanKhan", "Wondwossen WaleTesega", "SiChen", "MisaTojo", "YoshitoIto", "AkiraSato", "MasahitoHitosugi", "ShigeruMiyagawa", "HisakazuOgita"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbc.2023.102993"}
{"title": "Identification of long non-coding RNA in formaldehyde-induced cardiac dysplasia in rats.", "abstract": "Formaldehyde exposure during pregnancy can cause fetal congenital heart disease (CHD). However, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Studies on the biology of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) show that lncRNAs can influence cardiac development and disease. However, expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms of action of lncRNAs in formaldehyde-induced CHD remain unclear. We used high-throughput sequencing strategies as a means of identifying lncRNA expression profiles in heart tissues of normal and formaldehyde-exposed newborn rats. Overall, 763 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, including 325 and 438 that were respectively up-regulated and down-regulated. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the Ras and hedgehog signaling pathways may be important regulatory pathways in CHD caused by exposure to formaldehyde. A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed and a key miRNA, rno-miR-665, was identified. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis verified that the novel lncRNAs: MSTRG.27313.2, MSTRG.30629.2, MSTRG.36520.33, MSTRG.91234.1, and MSTRG.91233.9, were upregulated in the formaldehyde-exposed group.

{"title": "Ischemia promotes acyl-CoAs dephosphorylation and propionyl-CoA accumulation.", "abstract": "Our untargeted metabolic data unveiled that Acyl-CoAs undergo dephosphorylation, however little is known about these novel metabolites and their physiology/pathology relevance.\nTo understand the relationship between acyl-CoAs dephosphorylation and energy status as implied in our previous work, we seek to investigate how ischemia (energy depletion) triggers metabolic changes, specifically acyl-CoAs dephosphorylation in this work.\nRat hearts were isolated and perfused in Langendorff mode for 15\u00a0min followed by 0, 5, 15, and 30\u00a0minutes of global ischemia. The heart tissues were harvested for metabolic analysis.\nAs expected, ATP and phosphocreatine were significantly decreased during ischemia. Most short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs progressively increased with ischemic time from 0 to 15\u00a0min, whereas a\u00a030-minute ischemia did not lead to further change. Unlike other acyl-CoAs, propionyl-CoA accumulated progressively in the hearts that underwent ischemia from 0 to 30\u00a0min. Progressive dephosphorylation occurred to all assayed acyl-CoAs and free CoA regardless their level changes during the ischemia.\nThe present work further confirms that dephosphorylation of acyl-CoAs is an energy-dependent process and how this dephosphorylation is mediated warrants further investigations. It is plausible that dephosphorylation of acyl-CoAs and limited anaplerosis are involved in ischemic injuries to heart. Further investigations are warranted to examine the mechanisms of acyl-CoA dephosphorylation and how the dephosphorylation is possibly involved in ischemic injuries.", "journal": "Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society", "date": "2023-02-08", "authors": ["WentaoHe", "Jessica MBerthiaume", "StephenPrevis", "TakharKasumov", "Guo-FangZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11306-023-01975-2\n10.1007/s003950170013\n10.2165/00126839-200405040-00002\n10.1074/jbc.M109.048744\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)64849-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300987\n10.1074/jbc.M113.524314\n10.1194/jlr.D045112\n10.1074/jbc.M114.631549\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)97445-4\n10.1007/978-1-61737-985-7_3\n10.1146/annurev-nutr-071816-064916\n10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005375\n10.1006/jmcc.1994.1023\n10.1016/0026-0495(84)90199-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.00820.2016\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.09.070\n10.1124/dmd.32.11.1304\n10.1038/nchembio.1906\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.03.008\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03659\n10.1152/ajpendo.00081.2018\n10.1074/jbc.M109.055665\n10.1016/j.cmet.2020.11.020"}

{"title": "Effects of Mitochondrial ATP-Sensitive Potassium Channel in Rats with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Its Association with the AKT/mTOR Pathway.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is associated with the autophagy and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway plays a crucial role in this mechanism.\nAcute myocardial infarction rat models were assessed 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 hours after the induction of the myocardial infarction using hematoxylin and eosin staining, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, myocardial enzyme measurements, and levels of autophagic activity. Additionally, diazoxide, 5-hydroxydecanoate, and LY294002 were intraperitoneally administered to rat models at peak myocardial injury to assess their effects on cardiac injury. The expression levels of autophagy-related and apoptosis-related proteins, as well as p-AKT and p-mTOR, were measured. Electron microscopy was used to assess the ultrastructure and the number of autophagosomes in the cardiac tissue.\nWe demonstrated that the degree of myocardial injury and the level of autophagy were significantly elevated in the experimental cohort compared with the control cohort. In addition, the myocardial infarct size was significantly smaller in diazoxide-treated acute myocardial infarction rats compared with untreated rats. Diazoxide also decreased the levels of myocardial injury markers, autophagy, and apoptosis, while it also induced the levels of AKT and mTOR phosphorylation, decreased the number of autophagosomes, and improved the myocardial ultrastructure of the acute myocardial infarction rats. 5-Hydroxydecanoate treatment resulted in an opposite effect to those observed upon diazoxide treatment. LY294002 was also able to reverse diazoxide treatment effects.\nPeak levels of myocardial tissue injury and autophagy were observed 2 hours post-acute myocardial infarction induction in rats. Diazoxide treatment inhibited myocardial autophagy and apoptosis while protecting cardiac tissue from ischemic injury, which is likely to have proceeded through activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway.", "journal": "Anatolian journal of cardiology", "date": "2023-02-08", "authors": ["QianZeng", "Long-DanZhang", "Quan-FangChen", "WeiWang", "ZhouHuang", "Dong-LingHuang", "FanWang", "FengYang", "JifeiNong", "JieYang", "JinchengZeng"], "doi": "10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2022.2406\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.121)\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.01.001)\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.054)\n10.2147/IJN.S117425)\n10.1038/305147a0)\n10.1161/01.res.81.6.1072)\n10.1161/01.res.87.6.460)\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0706050)\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2007.01031.x)\n10.1002/jcp.27262)\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.02.008)\n10.1128/MCB.21.17.5899-5912.2001)\n10.1523/jneurosci.22-19-08458.2002)\n10.1002/cbin.11329)\n10.26355/eurrev_202010_23438)\n10.1113/jphysiol.2010.190462)\n10.3892/mmr.2020.11396)\n10.1016/j.arr.2020.101250)\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101777)\n10.1007/s10456-020-09720-2)\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.001)\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.031484)\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.01.009)\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000130647.29030.90)\n10.1152/ajpheart.00840.2007)\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000103696.60047.55)\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.06.027)\n10.1159/000485884)\n10.1016/j.phymed.2012.01.002)\n10.3390/molecules161210002)\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.09.013)\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000239)\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2450)\n10.1007/s12012-016-9358-y)\n10.1089/ars.2014.5887)\n10.1038/cddis.2017.7)\n10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109464)\n10.1007/s10495-007-0090-8)\n10.1016/j.phymed.2019.153035)\n10.1159/000490338)\n10.1152/ajpheart.00183.2004)\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.01.017)"}

{"title": "Recent advances in biological pumps as a building block for bioartificial hearts.", "abstract": "The field of biological pumps is a subset of cardiac tissue engineering and focused on the development of tubular grafts that are designed generate intraluminal pressure. In the simplest embodiment, biological pumps are tubular grafts with contractile cardiomyocytes on the external surface. The rationale for biological pumps is a transition from planar 3D cardiac patches to functional biological pumps, on the way to complete bioartificial hearts.

{"title": "The role of major immune cells in myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a cardiovascular disease (CVD) with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, often leading to adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure, which is a serious threat to human life and health. The immune system makes an important contribution to the maintenance of normal cardiac function. In the disease process of MI, necrotic cardiomyocytes release signals that activate nonspecific immunity and trigger the action of specific immunity. Complex immune cells play an important role in all stages of MI progression by removing necrotic cardiomyocytes and tissue and promoting the healing of damaged tissue cells. With the development of biomaterials, cardiac patches have become an emerging method of repairing MI, and the development of engineered cardiac patches through the construction of multiple animal models of MI can help treat MI.

As a type of CVDs, myocardial infarction (MI) induces ischemia hypoxia, which leads to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in multiple cell deaths and contributing to the subsequent development of heart failure or premature death. Recent evidence indicates that ROS-induced lipid peroxidation promotes autophagy and ferroptosis, leading to the loss of healthy myocardium and resulting in the dysfunction of cardiac tissue. Theoretically, cardiac function would be preserved after MI by inhibiting autophagy and ferroptosis. As an analog of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and a clinically approved drug, idebenone would be used to inhibit ferroptosis and preserve cardiac function due to its capacity to improve mitochondrial physiology with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

To address this, we evaluated transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications in the diabetic heart because tRNA modifications have been implicated in diabetic etiologies.\ntRNA was isolated from aorta, apex, and atrial tissue of healthy and diabetic murine hearts and related hyperglycemic cell models. tRNA modifications and canonical ribonucleosides were quantified by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using stable isotope dilution.

{"title": "[ANMCO Position paper: Amyloidosis for the clinical cardiologist. A \"clinical primer\" from the ANMCO Rare Disease Working Group].", "abstract": "Cardiac amyloidosis, in the three forms of immunoglobulin light chain (AL), transthyretin (ATTR) wild type (ATTRwt) and mutated (ATTRv) amyloidosis, is an increasingly known and recognized disease in the cardiovascular setting. The first stage of the patient's journey is the clinical suspicion of the disease, which is placed, in presence of a hypertrophic phenotype, by the identification of red flags, both extracardiac and cardiac clues whose presence increase the probability of being faced with a patient with this disease. The second stage is represented by diagnosis, which occurs with certainty through the identification of amyloid substance in cardiac tissue. This stage is spotted in wo parts, i.e. disease confirmation and disease etiology definition (AL vs ATTRwt vs ATTRv). However, it is possible in some selected cases to make a diagnosis of ATTR without the need for tissue assessment, in presence of a positive grade 2-3 bisphosphonate scintigraphy and absence of monoclonal component. Once the diagnosis has been made, the third stage is the assessment of prognosis, the fourth is the patient therapy pathway and fifth is the follow-up plan. Prognosis evaluation is based on different staging systems at the onset of the disease, whose applicability in the era of new effective therapies is still to be defined. To date, the transthyretin tetramer stabilizer tafamidis is the only approved treatment for both wild-type and mutant ATTR cardiomyopathy without polyneuropathy, while ATTRv with associated neuropathy can benefit from treatment with patisiran, an inhibitor of hepatic protein synthesis. Therapies for complications and comorbidities, must be addressed individually, due to the lack of specific clinical trials on this category of patients. In fact, it is important to take into consideration the risks linked to the use of some drugs due to the infiltration of the conduction tissue by the amyloid substance, which increases the risk of bradycardia and heart blocks, the tendency towards hypotension and the increased thromboembolic risk. It is also essential to follow the course of the disease and the efficacy of the treatment in affected patients with a standardized follow-up, and to identify early the signs/symptoms of the disease in asymptomatic TTR mutation carriers.This ANMCO position paper on amyloidosis aims to provide the clinical cardiologist with a practical summary of the disease, to accompany the patient with amyloidosis in the various stages of his journey.", "journal": "Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)", "date": "2023-02-04", "authors": ["CristinaChimenti", "SusannaGrego", "StefaniaDi Fusco", "LeonardoDe Luca", "PasqualeCaldarola", "MargheritaCannillo", "ManlioCipriani", "AndreaDi Lenarda", "DomenicaDonato", "SimonaLeone", "GiuseppeLimongelli", "AlessandroNavazio", "CarmineRiccio", "SerafinaValente", "Michele MassimoGulizia", "DomenicoGabrielli", "FabrizioOliva", "FurioColivicchi"], "doi": "10.1714/3963.39421"}

PA imaging offers a portable, inexpensive, stand-alone modality for evaluating optical contrast agents.

Moreover, radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a promising treatment for certain cardiac arrhythmias. Assessment of RF-ablated lesions is of clinical importance. The purpose of this study is to elaborate the PA imaging to characterize RF-ablated cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Quercetin inhibits the expression of MYC and CYP2E1 and reduces oxidative stress in the myocardium of spontaneously hypertensive rats.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress is one of the most important pathological processes in chronic heart failure caused by hypertension. These processes involve MYC-regulated mechanisms, including the induction of CYP2E1 as a potent prooxidant factor. In this work, we used qPCR, Western blot analysis, and biochemical markers of oxidative stress to investigate the ability of quercetin to inhibit oxidative stress by modulating MYC expression. We studied spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) in which the onset of cardiac pathology was observed at least at 4 months of age and the development of pathology occurred during life up to 22 months of age. Wistar rats were used as normotensive controls. We observed overexpression of the transcription factor MYC (p=0.0024) in the myocardium of SHRs compared to normotensive controls, and an increased expression of MYC-target gene, CYP2E1, (p=0.0001) in the old SHR group compared to young SHRs. This probably contributed significantly to the development of oxidative stress in the cardiac tissue of old SHRs. We demonstrated that long-term treatment of old SHRs with quercetin resulted in dramatic inhibition of MYC (p=0.0000), and a significant decrease in\u00a0CYP2E1 (p=0.0001)\u00a0expression and CYP2E1 protein levels (p=0.0136). This probably contributed significantly to the decrease in lipid peroxidation (p=0.0000). Quercetin was also able to activate antioxidant activity, resulting in a significant improvement in the prooxidant-antioxidant balance in the heart. In turn, the elimination of oxidative stress could contribute to a decrease in blood pressure (p=0.0000) and relative heart weight (p=0.0071) in quercetin-treated old SHRs compared to the untreated old SHR group.", "journal": "Acta biochimica Polonica", "date": "2023-02-03", "authors": ["OksanaMaksymchuk", "AngelaShysh", "AnnaKotliarova"], "doi": "10.18388/abp.2020_6517"}

The mechanisms are complicated. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on the myocardium of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) without heart failure. Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normal controls. SHRs were randomly divided into the SHR group and the -treated group. After 8 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, the morphology of heart tissues was examined. The mRNA expression profiles were identified via RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Various analysis methods were used to find the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to predict gene function and coexpression. After dapagliflozin treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced compared with that in the SHR group. Myocardial remodeling was ameliorated compared with that in the SHR group. After dapagliflozin intervention, 75 DEGs (|log2-fold change | > 0 and Q value\u2009<\u20090.05) were identified in the heart tissues compared to the SHR group. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of the circadian rhythm genes Per3, Bhlhe41, and Nr1d1 was significantly upregulated, while the results were coincident with the RNA-Seq results.

{"title": "Statins change the cytokine profile in ", "abstract": "Chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most severe manifestation of Chagas disease.CCC is characterized by cardiac inflammation and fibrosis caused by a persistent inflammatory response. Following infection, macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 to control parasitemia. Although this response contains parasite infection, it causes damage to the heart tissue. Thus, the use of immunomodulators is a rational alternative to CCC. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2 are RhoA-activated serine/threonine kinases that regulate the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Both ROCKs have been implicated in the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 (pro-inflammatory) phenotype. Statins are FDA-approved lipid-lowering drugs that reduce RhoA signaling by inhibiting geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthesis. This work aims to identify the effect of statins on U937 macrophage polarization and cardiac tissue inflammation and its relationship with ROCK activity during T. cruzi infection.\nPMA-induced, wild-type, GFP-, CA-ROCK1- and CA-ROCK2-expressing U937 macrophages were incubated with atorvastatin, or the inhibitors Y-27632, JSH-23, TAK-242, or C3 exoenzyme incubated with or without T. cruzi trypomastigotes for 30 min to evaluate the activity of ROCK and the M1 and M2 cytokine expression and secretion profiling. Also, ROCK activity was determined in T. cruzi-infected, BALB/c mice hearts.\nIn this study, we demonstrate for the first time in macrophages that incubation with T. cruzi leads to ROCK activation via the TLR4 pathway, which triggers NF-\u03baB activation. Inhibition of ROCKs by Y-27632 prevents NF-\u03baB activation and the expression and secretion of M1 markers, as does treatment with atorvastatin. Furthermore, we show that the effect of atorvastatin on the NF-kB pathway and cytokine secretion is mediated by ROCK. Finally, statin treatment decreased ROCK activation and expression, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in chronic chagasic mice hearts.\nThese results suggest that the statin modulation of the inflammatory response due to ROCK inhibition is a potential pharmacological strategy to prevent cardiac inflammation in CCC.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2023-01-31", "authors": ["FabiolaGonz\u00e1lez-Herrera", "Natasha SClayton", "DanielaGuzm\u00e1n-Rivera", "IleanaCarrillo", "ChristianCastillo", "MabelCatal\u00e1n", "RenattoAnfossi", "HelenaQuintero-Pertuz", "Mar\u00eda ElenaQuilaqueo", "ClaudioOlea-Azar", "MarioRivera-Meza", "UlrikeKemmerling", "Anne JRidley", "Ra\u00falVivar", "Juan DiegoMaya"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.1035589\n10.3390/pathogens10050505\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-020117-043711\n10.1056/NEJMoa1507574\n10.14348/molcells.2014.2374\n10.3389/fimmu.2015.00659\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.008\n10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095906\n10.3389/fcimb.2021.765879\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01929\n10.1128/IAI.71.3.1185-1193.2003\n10.3389/fcimb.2021.785166\n10.1038/nrm1128\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.004\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000000768\n10.1161/01.ATV.20.11.2351\n10.3390/ijms20061331\n10.1155/2020/4126913\n10.1371/journal.pone.0054841\n10.1016/j.tips.2007.04.006\n10.1086/528988\n10.1038/343425a0\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2008.12.023\n10.1186/s12967-021-02727-3\n10.1128/AAC.02137-16\n10.1128/AAC.02141-19\n10.1074/jbc.M910362199\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2021.109978\n10.1042/BJ20071342\n10.1042/BCJ20190203\n10.1093/nar/29.9.e45\n10.1074/jbc.274.52.37385\n10.1074/jbc.M112.398479\n10.1074/jbc.M111.282905\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165707\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1000870\n10.4049/jimmunol.173.9.5688\n10.1038/sigtrans.2017.23\n10.1016/j.febslet.2004.06.056\n10.1371/journal.pone.0087082\n10.1161/hq1101.098486\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0003770\n10.1111/jcmm.14819\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.12.043\n10.1253/circj.CJ-09-0135\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.07.007\n10.1016/j.ahj.2011.01.024\n10.3892/etm.2019.8176\n10.1172/jci.insight.93187\n10.1016/j.cyto.2011.12.009\n10.1111/sji.12501\n10.1093/molehr/gal113\n10.1002/art.23986\n10.1096/fj.201900752R\n10.1128/IAI.00103-19\n10.1074/jbc.M113.520130\n10.3390/pathogens10111444\n10.1371/journal.pone.0225588\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.00604\n10.1016/S0016-5085(03)00283-X\n10.1164/rccm.200907-1061OC\n10.1007/s00204-014-1238-2\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02849.x\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.01738\n10.1152/ajplung.00271.2013\n10.1089/107999000312379\n10.1083/jcb.200612131\n10.1016/S0960-9822(95)00018-2\n10.1189/jlb.0412191\n10.1089/ars.2013.5524\n10.21037/atm.2019.07.50\n10.1177/147323001103900630\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.10.008\n10.1002/art.22169\n10.1016/j.taap.2018.03.005\n10.5414/CPP41397\n10.1016/j.intimp.2015.03.005\n10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0451\n10.1007/s43440-020-00085-3\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.09.001\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000142813.33538.82\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0000674"}

Since cardiovascular disease tends to worsen over time, early diagnosis is key for treatment. In addition, understanding the qualitative changes in the heart associated with aging, where information on the direct influences of aging on cardiovascular disease is limited, would also be useful for treatment and diagnosis. To fill these research gaps, the focus of our study was to detect the structural and functional molecular changes associated with the heart over time, with a focus on glycans, which reflect the type and state of cells.\nWe investigated glycan localization in the cardiac tissue of normal mice and their alterations during aging, using evanescent-field fluorescence-assisted lectin microarray, a technique based on lectin-glycan interaction, and lectin staining.\nThe glycan profiles in the left ventricle showed differences between the luminal side (medial) and wall side (lateral) regions. The medial region was characterized by the presence of sialic acid residues. Moreover, age-related changes in glycan profiles were observed at a younger age in the medial region.

{"title": "Mitochondrial transplant after ischemia reperfusion promotes cellular salvage and improves lung function during ex-vivo lung perfusion.", "abstract": "In lung transplantation, ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with mitochondrial damage can lead to graft rejection. Intact, exogenous mitochondria provide a unique treatment option to salvage damaged cells within lung tissue.\nWe developed a novel method to freeze and store allogeneic mitochondria isolated from porcine heart tissue. Stored mitochondria were injected into a model of induced ischemia-reperfusion injury using porcine ex-vivo lung perfusion. Treatment benefits to immune modulation, antioxidant defense, and cellular salvage were evaluated. These findings were corroborated in human lungs undergoing ex-vivo lung perfusion. Lung tissue homogenate and primary lung endothelial cells were then used to address underlying mechanisms.\nFollowing cold ischemia, mitochondrial transplant reduced lung pulmonary vascular resistance and tissue pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine secretion. Further, exogenous mitochondria reduced reactive oxygen species by-products and promoted glutathione synthesis, thereby salvaging cell viability. These results were confirmed in a human model of ex-vivo lung perfusion wherein transplanted mitochondria decreased tissue oxidative and inflammatory signaling, improving lung function. We demonstrate that transplanted mitochondria induce autophagy and suggest that bolstered autophagy may act upstream of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Importantly, chemical inhibitors of the MEK autophagy pathway blunted the favorable effects of mitochondrial transplant.\nThese data provide direct evidence that mitochondrial transplant improves cellular health and lung function when administered during ex-vivo lung perfusion and suggest the mechanism of action may be through promotion of cellular autophagy.

Early diagnosis is the key to improve CVD prognosis, and cardiovascular imaging plays a crucial role in this direction. Echocardiography is the most commonly used imaging modality. However, the need for early diagnosis/treatment favors the development of modalities providing information about tissue characterization beyond echocardiography. In this context, the rapid evolution of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) led to the coexistence of cardiologists and radiologists in the CMR field. Our aim was to provide an overview of indications, sequences, and reporting of CMR findings in various CVDs. The indications/limitations of CMR as well as the pathophysiological significance of various sequences in adult/pediatric CVDs are presented and discussed in detail. The role of CMR indices in the evaluation of the most common clinical scenarios in cardiology and their impact on CVD diagnosis/prognosis were analyzed in detail. Additionally, the comparison of CMR versus other imaging modalities is also discussed. Finally, future research directions are presented. CMR can provide cardiac tissue characterization and biventricular/biatrial functional assessment in the same examination, allowing for early and accurate identification of important subclinical abnormalities, before clinically overt CVD takes place.", "journal": "Hellenic journal of cardiology : HJC = Hellenike kardiologike epitheorese", "date": "2023-01-28", "authors": ["Sophie IMavrogeni", "AlexandrosKallifatidis", "SoultanaKourtidou", "NikiLama", "AikateriniChristidi", "EfstathiosDetorakis", "GrigoriosChatzantonis", "ThomasVrachliotis", "TheodorosKaramitsos", "KonstantinosKouskouras", "NikolaosKelekis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hjc.2023.01.003"}

Thus, we sought to determine the mechanisms of cardiovascular dysfunction and inflammation induced by aircraft noise in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI) and in humans with incident MI.\nC57BL/6J mice were exposed to noise alone (average sound pressure level 72 dB; peak level 85 dB) for up to 4 days, resulting in pro-inflammatory aortic gene expression in the myeloid cell adhesion/diapedesis pathways. The noise alone promoted adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory myeloid cells in vascular/cardiac tissue, paralleled by an increased percentage of leucocytes with a pro-inflammatory, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing phenotype and augmented expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase type 2 (Nox2)/phosphorylation of nuclear factor 'kappa light chain enhancer' of activated B-cells (phospho-NF\u03baB) in peripheral blood. Ligation of the left anterior descending artery resulted in worsening of cardiac function, pronounced cardiac infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid cells and Ly6Chigh monocytes, and induction of interleukin (IL) 6, IL-1\u03b2, CCL-2, and Nox2, being aggravated by noise exposure prior to MI. MI induced stronger endothelial dysfunction and more pronounced increases in vascular ROS in animals preconditioned with noise. Participants of the population-based Gutenberg Health Cohort Study (median follow-up:11.4 years) with incident MI revealed elevated C-reactive protein at baseline and worse left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after MI in case of a history of noise exposure and subsequent annoyance development.\nAircraft noise exposure before MI substantially amplifies subsequent cardiovascular inflammation and aggravates ischaemic heart failure, facilitated by a pro-inflammatory vascular conditioning.

However, the mechanism underlying AhR-induced cardiac defects in response to TCDD exposure remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the impacts of TCDD exposure on heart morphology and cardiac function in zebrafish. TCDD exposure in the early developmental stage of zebrafish embryos led to morphological heart malformation and pericardial edema, concomitant with reduced cardiac function. These cardiac defects were attenuated by inhibiting AhR activity with CH223191. Transcriptome profiling showed that, along with an upregulation of the AhR signaling pathway by TCDD treatment, the expression of pro-ferroptotic genes was upregulated, while that of genes implicated in glutathione metabolism were downregulated. Moreover, lipid peroxidation, as indicated by malonaldehyde (MDA) production, was increased in TCDD-exposed cardiac tissue. Accordingly, inhibiting lipid peroxidation with liproxstatin-1 reversed the adverse cardiac effects induced by TCDD treatment. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that AhR-mediated lipid peroxidation contributes to cardiac defects in the early developmental stage in zebrafish embryos exposed to TCDD.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2023-01-27", "authors": ["PingMi", "NaLi", "KangAi", "LeiLi", "DetianYuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.137942"}
{"title": "Assessing the arrhythmogenic risk of engineered heart tissue patches through in silico application on infarcted ventricle models.", "abstract": "Post myocardial infarction (MI) ventricles contain fibrotic tissue and may have disrupted electrical properties, both of which predispose to an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Application of epicardial patches obtained from human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are a potential long-term therapy to treat heart failure resulting from post MI remodelling. However, whether the introduction of these patches is anti- or pro-arrhythmic has not been studied.\nWe studied arrhythmic risk using in silico engineered heart tissue (EHT) patch engraftment on human post-MI ventricular models. Two patient models were studied, including one with a large dense scar and one with an apparent channel of preserved viability bordered on both sides by scar. In each heart model a virtual EHT patch was introduced as a layer of viable tissue overlying the scarred area, with hiPSC-CMs electrophysiological properties. The incidence of re-entrant and sustained activation in simulations with and without EHT patches was assessed and the arrhythmia inducibility compared in the context of different EHT patch properties (conduction velocity (CV) and action potential duration (APD)). The impact of the EHT patch on the likelihood of focal ectopic impulse propagation was estimated by assessing the minimum stimulus strength and duration required to generate a propagating impulse in the scar border zone (BZ) with and without patch.\nWe uncovered two main mechanisms by which ventricular tachycardia (VT) risk could be either augmented or attenuated by the interaction of the patch with the tissue. In the case of isthmus-related VT, our simulations predict that EHT patches can prevent the induction of VT when the, generally longer, hiPSC-CMs APD is reduced towards more physiological values. In the case of large dense scar, we found that, an EHT patch with CV similar to the host myocardium does not promote VT, while EHT patches with lower CV increase the risk of VT, by promoting both non-sustained and sustained re-entry. Finally, our simulations indicate that electrically coupled EHT patches reduce the likelihood of propagation of focal ectopic impulses.\nThe introduction of EHT patches as a treatment for heart failure has the potential to augment or attenuate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, and variations in the anatomic configuration of the substrate, the functional properties of the BZ and the electrophysiologic properties of the patch itself will determine the overall impact. Planning for delivery of this therapy will need to consider the possible impact on arrhythmia.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2023-01-27", "authors": ["DamianoFassina", "CarolineM Costa", "MartinBishop", "GernotPlank", "JohnWhitaker", "Sian EHarding", "Steven ANiederer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106550"}

However, its potential role in diabetes, especially in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), remains largely unexplored. In this study, using affinity enrichment and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, we quantitatively analyze the kbhb residues on heart tissues of a DCM model rat. A total of 3,520 kbhb sites in 1,089 proteins were identified in this study. Further analysis showed that 336 kbhb sites in 143 proteins were differentially expressed between the heart tissues of DCM and wild-type rats. Among them, 284 kbhb sites in 96 proteins were upregulated, while 52 kbhb sites in 47 proteins were downregulated. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteomic results revealed that these kbhb-modified proteins were widely distributed in various components and involved in a wide range of cellular functions and biological processes (BPs). Functional analysis showed that the kbhb-modified proteins were involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and propanoate metabolism. Our findings demonstrated how kbhb is related to many metabolic pathways and is mainly involved in energy metabolism.

{"title": "Increased Myosin light chain 9 expression during Kawasaki disease vasculitis.", "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that predominantly afflicts children. KD development is known to be associated with an aberrant immune response and abnormal platelet activation, however its etiology is still largely unknown. Myosin light chain 9 (Myl9) is known to regulate cellular contractility of both non-muscle and smooth muscle cells, and can be released from platelets, whereas any relations of Myl9 expression to KD vasculitis have not been examined.\nPlasma Myl9 concentrations in KD patients and children with febrile illness were measured and associated with KD clinical course and prognosis. Myl9 release from platelets in KD patients was also evaluated in vitro. Myl9 expression was determined in coronary arteries from Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE)-injected mice that develop experimental KD vasculitis, as well as in cardiac tissues obtained at autopsy from KD patients.\nPlasma Myl9 levels were significantly higher in KD patients during the acute phase compared with healthy controls or patients with other febrile illnesses, declined following IVIG therapy in IVIG-responders but not in non-responders. In vitro, platelets from KD patients released Myl9 independently of thrombin stimulation. In the LCWE-injected mice, Myl9 was detected in cardiac tissue at an early stage before inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. In tissues obtained at autopsy from KD patients, the highest Myl9 expression was observed in thrombi during the acute phase and in the intima and adventitia of coronary arteries during the chronic phase. Thus, our studies show that Myl9 expression is significantly increased during KD vasculitis and that Myl9 levels may be a useful biomarker to estimate inflammation and IVIG responsiveness to KD.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2023-01-24", "authors": ["HironobuKobayashi", "Motoko YKimura", "IchitaHasegawa", "EisukeSuganuma", "YuzuruIkehara", "KazuhikoAzuma", "ToshihiroIto", "RyotaEbata", "YosukeKurashima", "YoheiKawasaki", "YukiShiko", "NaokiSaito", "HirotaroIwase", "YounghoLee", "MagaliNoval Rivas", "MosheArditi", "MasahikoZuka", "HiromichiHamada", "ToshinoriNakayama"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.1036672\n10.1016/s0140-6736(04)16814-1\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000484\n10.1253/circj.CJ-19-1094\n10.1056/nejm198608073150601\n10.1586/1744666x.2015.1044980\n10.1093/cei/uxac046\n10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.006\n10.1002/art.37815\n10.1038/s41467-022-30357-w\n10.1128/cmr.11.3.405\n10.1038/ng.2007.59\n10.1038/tpj.2011.45\n10.1016/s0140-6736(18)32003-8\n10.1111/imr.12559\n10.1007/s00281-019-00734-7\n10.4049/jimmunol.0900646\n10.1126/sciimmunol.aaf9154\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.594297\n10.1016/j.immuni.2019.05.021\n10.1111/j.1442-200x.2003.01810.x\n10.1253/circj.cj-12-1037\n10.3346/jkms.2017.32.7.1147\n10.1038/s41598-019-54113-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.592865\n10.1111/ped.14326\n10.1038/nrrheum.2015.54\n10.1016/j.echo.2016.03.017\n10.1161/circulationaha.111.072769\n10.1538/expanim.19-0124\n10.2144/000112517\n10.1016/s1074-7613(03)00177-8\n10.1097/inf.0000000000002563\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04073.x\n10.1111/ped.12120\n10.1038/ng.2220\n10.4049/jimmunol.1600388\n10.1161/circresaha.121.319153\n10.1111/j.1442-200x.2005.02049.x\n10.1073/pnas.2203437119\n10.1016/s2665-9913(20)30420-3\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.05.007"}

Pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death) has gradually gained attention in the context of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition to the inhibition of platelet activation by ticagrelor, little is known about its other pharmacological effects. Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) has been shown to contribute to the pathological process of pyroptosis, but whether it is related to the potential role of ticagrelor is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of ticagrelor on Dox-induced pyroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Rats were treated with ticagrelor (7.5 mg/kg, i.g.) 1 h before intravenous injection of Dox (2.5 mg/kg), once every 3 days, six times in total.

{"title": "lncRNA LOC100911717-targeting GAP43-mediated sympathetic remodeling after myocardial infarction in rats.", "abstract": "Sympathetic remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is the primary cause of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD). M1-type macrophages are closely associated with inflammation and sympathetic remodeling after MI. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for the regulation of cardiovascular disease development. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the lncRNAs involved in MI and reveal a possible regulatory mechanism.\nM0- and M1-type macrophages were selected for sequencing and screened for differentially expressed lncRNAs. The data revealed that lncRNA LOC100911717 was upregulated in M1-type macrophages but not in M0-type macrophages. In addition, the lncRNA LOC100911717 was upregulated in heart tissues after MI. Furthermore, an RNA pull-down assay revealed that lncRNA LOC100911717 could interact with growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43). Essentially, immunofluorescence assays and programmed electrical stimulation demonstrated that GAP43 expression was suppressed and VA incidence was reduced after lncRNA LOC100911717 knockdown in rat hearts using an adeno-associated virus.\nWe observed a novel relationship between lncRNA LOC100911717 and GAP43. After MI, lncRNA LOC100911717 was upregulated and GAP43 expression was enhanced, thus increasing the extent of sympathetic remodeling and the frequency of VA events. Consequently, silencing lncRNA LOC100911717 could reduce sympathetic remodeling and VAs.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2023-01-24", "authors": ["PingjiangLi", "KangWang", "JieYin", "LeiQi", "HeshengHu", "PeijinYang", "YugenShi", "YanLi", "MengFeng", "HangjiLyu", "WeiliGe", "XiaoluLi", "SuhuaYan"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2022.1019435\n10.1146/annurev-med-041316-090046\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104139\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103964\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103713\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103745\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103370\n10.1186/s13148-021-01152-z\n10.3390/jcdd8050057\n10.1111/pace.13856\n10.1016/j.autneu.2016.07.001\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.08.011\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.01.010\n10.1016/j.brainres.2006.09.054\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.142836\n10.3389/fphys.2020.01113\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.02.001\n10.1007/s00395-009-0033-3\n10.1111/jcmm.13185\n10.1038/s41580-019-0209-0\n10.1101/gad.1800909\n10.1038/nrd4018\n10.1007/s00018-016-2174-5\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.012\n10.3390/cells11010005\n10.1007/s13105-021-00821-0\n10.1186/s12943-021-01313-x\n10.1038/nrneph.2016.51\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.16752\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023686\n10.1038/hr.2015.26\n10.1038/nbt.3122\n10.1111/apha.13315\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2018.06.003\n10.1111/jcmm.17309\n10.1016/j.redox.2019.101186\n10.1177/1074248417702894\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00308-4\n10.1161/JAHA.118.009938\n10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10072-2\n10.3389/fncel.2017.00266\n10.14283/jpad.2021.60\n10.1186/s12885-020-07728-x\n10.1186/s12967-018-1682-5\n10.1016/j.biopha.2010.01.012\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103968\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.09.013\n10.1007/978-3-030-92034-0_5\n10.1111/jcmm.13866"}

Rats were then administered saline solution (model and sham operation control groups) or drugs by oral gavage for 28 d. Echocardiography was performed and serum creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponin I levels were monitored to examine the cardiac function. Inflammation was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining of heart tissue, and serum interleukin-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurements.

Novel approaches are now being investigated in order to speedily overcome the challenges in this path. Tissue engineering has been revolutionized by the advent of nanomaterials, and later by the application of carbon-based nanomaterials because of their exceptional variable functionality, conductivity, and mechanical properties. Electrically conductive biomaterials used as cell bearers provide the tissue with an appropriate microenvironment for the specific seeded cells as substrates for the sake of protecting cells in biological media against attacking mechanisms. Nevertheless, their advantages and shortcoming in view of cellular behavior, toxicity, and targeted delivery depend on the tissue in which they are implanted or being used as a scaffold. This review seeks to address, summarize, classify, conceptualize, and discuss the use of carbon-based nanoparticles in cardiac tissue engineering emphasizing their conductivity. We considered electrical conductivity as a key affecting the regeneration of cells. Correspondingly, we reviewed conductive polymers used in tissue engineering and specifically in cardiac repair as key biomaterials with high efficiency. We comprehensively classified and discussed the advantages of using conductive biomaterials in cardiac tissue engineering. An overall review of the open literature on electroactive substrates including carbon-based biomaterials over the last decade was provided, tabulated, and thoroughly discussed.

{"title": "A Patent Review on Cardiotoxicity of Anticancerous Drugs.", "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is an increasing concern and it is critical to avoid heart dysfunction induced by medications used in various cancers. Dysregulated cardiomyocyte homeostasis is a critical phenomenon of drug-induced cardiotoxicity, which hinders the cardiac tissue's natural physiological function. Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is responsible for various heart disorders such as myocardial infarction, myocardial hypertrophy, and arrhythmia, among others. Chronic cardiac stress due to drug toxicity restricts the usage of cancer medications. Anticancer medications can cause a variety of adverse effects, especially cardiovascular toxicity. This review is focused on anticancerous drugs anthracyclines, trastuzumab, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and associated pathways attributed to the drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Several factors responsible for enhanced cardiotoxicity are age, gender specificity, diseased conditions, and therapy are also discussed. The review also highlighted the patents assigned for different methodologies involved in the assessment and reducing cardiotoxicity. Recent advancements where the usage of trastuzumab and bevacizumab have caused cardiac dysfunction and their effects alone or in combination on cardiac cells are explained. Extensive research on patents associated with protection against cardiotoxicity has shown that chemicals like bis(dioxopiperazine)s and manganese compounds were cardioprotective when combined with other selected anticancerous drugs. Numerous patents are associated with drug-induced toxicity, prevention, and diagnosis, that may aid in understanding the current issues and developing novel therapies with safer cardiovascular outcomes. Also, the advancements in technology and research going on are yet to be explored to overcome the present issue of cardiotoxicity with the development of new drug formulations.", "journal": "Cardiovascular & hematological agents in medicinal chemistry", "date": "2023-01-24", "authors": ["RenuBhadana", "VibhaRani"], "doi": "10.2174/1871525721666230120155734"}
{"title": "Effect of in ovo creatine monohydrate on hatchability, post-hatch performance, breast muscle yield and fiber size in chicks from young breeder flocks.", "abstract": "Younger broiler breeder flocks produce smaller eggs containing smaller yolks, with potentially lower energy reserves for the developing chick. Creatine is a naturally occurring energy source and is abundant in metabolically active tissues; providing this to chicks in ovo should provide additional energy to improve hatchability and post-hatch growth. Thus, post-hatch performance of male and female chicks hatched from younger breeder flocks supplemented with creatine monohydrate (CrM) in ovo was investigated. Four hundred eggs from Ross 308 breeder hens aged 27 to 29 wk were collected and at d 14 assigned to a treatment group and received 1) no injection, 2) 0.75% saline injection, or 3) 8.16 mg creatine monohydrate in 0.75% saline. At hatch 72 birds (24/treatment) were euthanized and BW, breast muscle, heart and liver weight were obtained, and breast muscle tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin. Birds were then placed in raised metal pens (24 pens; 10-11 birds/pen; 8 replicates/treatment) and grown to d 42 with BW and pen feed intake measured once a week. At d 42, ninty-six birds were euthanized (2 male and 2 female/pen) and the process occurred as at hatch. Body composition was obtained for 48 birds (2/pen; 1 male,1 female) with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. Breast muscle tissue was processed for histological analysis and breast muscle fiber parameters were analyzed by ImageJ. While not statistically significant, the CrM treatment group saw an improved hatch rate (CrM: 93.5%, Saline: 88.6%, Control: 88.8%) and reduced early post hatch mortality. Chicks given in ovo CrM had significantly increased creatine concentrations in both liver and heart tissue at hatch compared to those in the saline and control groups. BW, BW gain, and final body composition parameters were not statistically different between treatments and in ovo CrM did not affect breast muscle fiber number or area. The creatine injection likely improved the energy status of the growing embryo resulting in the improved hatch rate but leaving little reserves for post-hatch growth.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["Corey-Ann BFirman", "VivienneInhuber", "David JCadogan", "William H E JVan Wettere", "Rebecca E AForder"], "doi": "10.1016/j.psj.2022.102447"}
{"title": "NUCLEOLIN PROTECTS CARDIOMYOCYTES BY UPREGULATING PGC-1\u03b1 AND PROMOTING MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS IN LPS-INDUCED MYOCARDIAL INJURY.", "abstract": "Background: Lipopolysaccride-induced myocardial injury was characterized by frequent mitochondrial dysfunction. Our previous studies found that nucleolin (NCL) played important protective roles in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recently, it has been found that NCL has a protective effect on LPS-induced myocardial injury in vivo . However, the exact underlying mechanisms that how NCL protects myocardium against the LPS-induced myocardial injury remains unclear. Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the protective role of NCL in LPS-induced myocardial injury from the aspect of mitochondrial biogenesis. Methods: The cardiac-specific NCL-knockout (NCL -/- ) or NCL f/f mice were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg) to induce LPS-induced myocardial injury. The supernatant generated after LPS stimulation of macrophages was used as the conditioned medium to stimulate H9C2 and established the injured cell model. Analysis of mRNA stability, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay, and luciferase reporter assay were performed to detect the mechanism by which NCL regulated the expression of PGC-1\u03b1. Results: The expression of NCL and PGC-1\u03b1 was elevated in cardiac tissue and cardiomyocytes during LPS-induced myocardial injury. The cardiac-specific NCL-knockout decreased PGC-1\u03b1 expression, inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased cardiomyocytes death during LPS-induced myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo . In contrast, the overexpression of NCL could improve mitochondrial biogenesis in H9C2 cells. Moreover, the analysis of mRNA stability and luciferase reporter assay revealed that the interaction between NCL and PGC-1\u03b1 significantly promoted the stability of PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA, thereby upregulating the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and exerting a cardioprotective effect. In addition, the activation of PGC-1\u03b1 diminished the detrimental effects of NCL knockdown on mitochondrial biogenesis in vitro and in vivo . Conclusions: Nucleolin upregulated the gene expression of PGC-1\u03b1 by directly binding to the 5'-UTR of PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA and increasing its mRNA stabilities, then promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, and played protective effect on cardiomyocytes during LPS-induced myocardial injury. Taken together, all these data showed that NCL activated PGC-1\u03b1 to rescue cardiomyocytes from LPS-induced myocardial injury insult, suggesting that the cardioprotective role of NCL might be a promising prospect for clinical treatment of patients with endotoxemia.", "journal": "Shock (Augusta, Ga.)", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["LeijingYin", "YutingTang", "ZhengyangLuo", "LudongYuan", "XiaofangLin", "ShuxinWang", "PengfeiLiang", "BimeiJiang"], "doi": "10.1097/SHK.0000000000002084"}

Energy drinks were given to the first group (the energy drink group), alcohol was given to the second group, and energy drinks and alcohol were given to the third group Redbull-Alcohol (RA). Blood samples, leg muscles, and heart tissues were studied after the ischemia-reperfusion model was created at the infrarenal level.\nIn the histopathological examination of heart muscles, the damage was significantly more severe in the RA group than in the control group (P <.05). There was no significant change in the RA group in the limb muscle; however, muscle fiber abnormality was higher. The energy drink group was more prone to carbon dioxide retention and hypoxia, resulting in respiratory acidosis. (P =.05). Lactate was significantly higher in the energy drink group (P =.002). Glucose concentrations of energy drink and RA groups were higher (P =.02).\nThe high lactate values of the energy drink group and more damaged fibers in the striated muscles in the RA group showed that they are more susceptible to ischemia.

{"title": "COVID-19 Heart Lesions in Children: Clinical, Diagnostic and Immunological Changes.", "abstract": "In the beginning of COVID-19, the proportion of confirmed cases in the pediatric population was relatively small and there was an opinion that children often had a mild or asymptomatic course of infection. Our understanding of the immune response, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 is highly oriented towards the adult population. At the same time, despite the fact that COVID-19 in children usually occurs in a mild form, there is an incomplete understanding of the course as an acute infection and its subsequent manifestations such as Long-COVID-19 or Post-COVID-19, PASC in the pediatric population, correlations with comorbidities and immunological changes. In mild COVID-19 in childhood, some authors explain the absence of population decreasing T and B lymphocytes. Regardless of the patient's condition, they can have the second phase, related to the exacerbation of inflammation in the heart tissue even if the viral infection was completely eliminated-post infectious myocarditis. Mechanism of myocardial dysfunction development in MIS-C are not fully understood. It is known that various immunocompetent cells, including both resident inflammatory cells of peripheral tissues (for example macrophages, dendritic cells, resident memory T-lymphocytes and so on) and also circulating in the peripheral blood immune cells play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of myocarditis. It is expected that hyperproduction of interferons and the enhanced cytokine response of T cells 1 and 2 types contribute to dysfunction of the myocardium. However, the role of Th1 in the pathogenesis of myocarditis remains highly controversial. At the same time, the clinical manifestations and mechanisms of damage, including the heart, both against the background and after COVID-19, in children differ from adults.

{"title": "Bacterial Cellulose-Based Blends and Composites: Versatile Biomaterials for Tissue Engineering Applications.", "abstract": "Cellulose of bacterial origin, known as bacterial cellulose (BC), is one of the most versatile biomaterials that has a huge potential in tissue engineering due to its favourable mechanical properties, high hydrophilicity, crystallinity, and purity. Additional properties such as porous nano-fibrillar 3D structure and a high degree of polymerisation of BC mimic the properties of the native extracellular matrix (ECM), making it an excellent material for the fabrication of composite scaffolds suitable for cell growth and tissue development. Recently, the fabrication of BC-based scaffolds, including composites and blends with nanomaterials, and other biocompatible polymers has received particular attention owing to their desirable properties for tissue engineering. These have proven to be promising advanced materials in hard and soft tissue engineering. This review presents the latest state-of-the-art modified/functionalised BC-based composites and blends as advanced materials in tissue engineering. Their applicability as an ideal biomaterial in targeted tissue repair including bone, cartilage, vascular, skin, nerve, and cardiac tissue has been discussed. Additionally, this review briefly summarises the latest updates on the production strategies and characterisation of BC and its composites and blends. Finally, the challenges in the future development and the direction of future research are also discussed.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors":

However, there are very few studies associating DXXK and energy protection. This study aims to explore the \"energy protection\" effect of DXXK on cardiotoxicity induced by DOX. A DOX-induced cardiotoxicity model established in rats and H9c2 cells are used to analyze the therapeutic effects of DXXK on serum indexes, cardiac function indexes and cardiac histopathology. The metabonomic methods were used to explore the potential mechanism of DXXK in treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, we also observed the mitochondrial- and autophagy-related indicators of myocardial cells and the mRNA expression level of the core target regulating energy-metabolism-related pathways. Our results indicated that DXXK can improve cardiac function, reduce myocardial enzymes and alleviate the histological damage of heart tissue caused by DOX. In addition, DXXK can improve mitochondrial damage induced by DOX and inhibit excessive autophagy. Metabonomics analysis showed that DOX can significantly affects the pathways related to energy metabolism of myocardial cells, which are involved in the therapeutic mechanism of DXXK. In conclusion, DXXK can treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through the AMPK-mediated energy protection pathway.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2023-01-22", "authors": ["TaoWang", "ChuqiaoYuan", "JiaLiu", "LiangyanDeng", "WeiLi", "JunlingHe", "HonglinLiu", "LipingQu", "JianmingWu", "WenjunZou"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms24020897\n10.1002/cncr.11407\n10.1111/bjh.15603\n10.1016/j.crvasa.2017.01.026\n10.1124/mol.119.115725\n10.1007/s12012-020-09626-x\n10.1186/s40959-019-0056-3\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.01.032\n10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.06.010\n10.1016/j.phymed.2018.01.009\n10.1093/jnci/djv357\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.120.314695\n10.3390/ijms23031912\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314681\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318241\n10.3389/fphys.2020.570421\n10.1089/ars.2018.7650\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111708\n10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153597\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.03.008\n10.1016/j.apsb.2020.10.007\n10.3390/ijms23010030\n10.1172/jci.insight.132747\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2006.06.024\n10.1073/pnas.1821022116\n10.13412/j.cnki.zyyl.2011.01.016\n10.16563/j.cnki.1671-6272.2008.02.004\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.01.057\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.02.026\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.11.129\n10.1056/NEJMra063052\n10.1177/1078155219877931\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312317\n10.1530/JOE-16-0679\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.165579\n10.1042/BSR20181767\n10.1016/j.tem.2015.05.010\n10.1016/j.tem.2014.11.001\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117498\n10.18632/aging.102418\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.08.032\n10.1515/med-2022-0415\n10.1096/fj.201901994R\n10.1182/blood-2018-02-831503\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.09.001\n10.1016/j.tcm.2012.07.003\n10.1016/j.omtn.2019.12.003\n10.1007/978-981-15-0602-4_4\n10.2174/0929867325666180406120051\n10.1111/boc.202000008\n10.1038/ncb2152"}
{"title": "The Roles of Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells in Coronary Collateral Growth Induced by Repetitive Ischemia.", "abstract": "Many clinical trials have attempted to use stem cells to treat ischemic heart diseases (IHD), but the benefits have been modest. Though coronary collaterals can be a \"natural bypass\" for IHD patients, the regulation of coronary collateral growth (CCG) and the role of endogenous stem cells in CCG are not fully understood. In this study, we used a bone marrow transplantation scheme to study the role of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) in a rat model of CCG. Transgenic GFP rats were used to trace BMSCs after transplantation; GFP bone marrow was harvested or sorted for bone marrow transplantation. After recovering from transplantation, the recipient rats underwent 10 days of repetitive ischemia (RI), with echocardiography before and after RI, to measure cardiac function and myocardial blood flow. At the end of RI, the rats were sacrificed for the collection of bone marrow for flow cytometry or heart tissue for imaging analysis. Our study shows that upon RI stimulation, BMSCs homed to the recipient rat hearts' collateral-dependent zone (CZ), proliferated, differentiated into endothelial cells, and engrafted in the vascular wall for collateral growth. These RI-induced collaterals improved coronary blood flow and cardiac function in the recipients' hearts during ischemia.

{"title": "Whole-Heart Tissue Engineering and Cardiac Patches: Challenges and Promises.", "abstract": "Despite all the advances in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cardiovascular disorders, they still account for a significant part of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The advent of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has provided novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of various diseases. Tissue engineering relies on three pillars: scaffolds, stem cells, and growth factors. Gene and cell therapy methods have been introduced as primary approaches to cardiac tissue engineering. Although the application of gene and cell therapy has resulted in improved regeneration of damaged cardiac tissue, further studies are needed to resolve their limitations, enhance their effectiveness, and translate them into the clinical setting. Scaffolds from synthetic, natural, or decellularized sources have provided desirable characteristics for the repair of cardiac tissue. Decellularized scaffolds are widely studied in heart regeneration, either as cell-free constructs or cell-seeded platforms. The application of human- or animal-derived decellularized heart patches has promoted the regeneration of heart tissue through in vivo and in vitro studies. Due to the complexity of cardiac tissue engineering, there is still a long way to go before cardiac patches or decellularized whole-heart scaffolds can be routinely used in clinical practice.

There are several vaccines against a few EV71 strains but no efficient drug for the treatment of EV71 infection. Therefore, it is urgent and of significance to develop anti-EV71 drugs. Here, we found that PLX8394, a RAF inhibitor, possesses high antiviral activity against EV71 in vitro, being superior to the traditional clinical drug ribavirin. Moreover, PLX8394 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against enteroviruses. Notably, in a suckling mouse model, PLX8394 provided a 70% protection rate for EV71-infected mice, reduced the viral load in liver and heart tissues, and relieved the inflammatory response.

{"title": "Oxygen-generating microparticles downregulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression, increase cardiac contractility, and mitigate ischemic injury.", "abstract": "Myocardial hypoxia is the low oxygen tension in the heart tissue implicated in many diseases, including ischemia, cardiac dysfunction, or after heart procurement for transplantation. Oxygen-generating microparticles have recently emerged as a potential strategy for supplying oxygen to sustain cell survival, growth, and tissue functionality in hypoxia. Here, we prepared oxygen-generating microparticles with poly D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid, and calcium peroxide (CPO), which yielded a continuous morphology capable of sustained oxygen release for up to 24\u00a0h. We demonstrated that CPO microparticles increased primary rat cardiomyocyte metabolic activity while not affecting cell viability during hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, which is upregulated during hypoxia, can be downregulated by delivering oxygen using CPO microparticles. Single-cell traction force microscopy data demonstrated that the reduced energy generated by hypoxic cells could be restored using CPO microparticles. We engineered cardiac tissues that showed higher contractility in the presence of CPO microparticles compared to hypoxic cells. Finally, we observed reduced myocardial injuries in ex vivo rabbit hearts treated with CPO microparticles. In contrast, an acute early myocardial injury was observed for the hearts treated with control saline solution in hypoxia. In conclusion, CPO microparticles improved cell and tissue contractility and gene expression while reducing hypoxia-induced myocardial injuries in the heart. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Oxygen-releasing microparticles can reduce myocardial ischemia, allograft rejection, or irregular heartbeats after heart transplantation. Here we present biodegradable oxygen-releasing microparticles that are capable of sustained oxygen release for more than 24 hrs. We then studied the impact of sustained oxygen release from microparticles on gene expresseion and cardiac cell and tissue function. Previous studies have not measured cardiac tissue or cell mechanics during hypoxia, which is important for understanding proper cardiac function and beating. Using traction force microscopy and an engineered tissue-on-a-chip, we demonstrated that our oxygen-releasing microparticles improve cell and tissue contractility during hypoxia while downregulating the HIF-1\u03b1 expression level. Finally, using the microparticles, we showed reduced myocardial injuries in rabbit heart tissue, confirming the potential of the particles to be used for organ transplantation or tissue engineering.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2023-01-21", "authors": ["KalpanaMandal", "SivakotiSangabathuni", "ReihanehHaghniaz", "SatoruKawakita", "MarvinMecwan", "AyaNakayama", "XuexiangZhang", "MasoudEdalati", "WeiHuang", "AnaLopez Hernandez", "VadimJucaud", "Mehmet RDokmeci", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2023.01.030"}
{"title": "Promoting early neovascularization by allotransplanted adipose-derived Muse cells in an ovine model of acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that bone marrow (BM)-derived Muse cells have a homing mechanism to reach damaged cardiac tissue while also being able to reduce myocardial infarct size and improve cardiac function; however, the potential of BM-Muse cells to foster new blood-vessel formation has not been fully assessed. Up to date, adipose tissue (AT)-derived Muse cells remain to be studied in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro and in vivo the neovascularization capacity of AT-Muse cells while exploring their biodistribution and differentiation potential in a translational ovine model of AMI.\nAT-Muse cells were successfully isolated from ovine adipose tissue. In adult sheep, one or more diagonal branches of the left anterior descending coronary artery were permanently ligated for thirty minutes. Sheep were randomized in two groups and treated with intramyocardial injections: Vehicle (PBS, n = 4) and AT-Muse (2x107 AT-Muse cells labeled with PKH26 Red Fluorescent Dye, n = 4). Molecular characterization showed higher expression of angiogenic genes (VEGF, PGF and ANG) and increased number of tube formation in AT-Muse cells group compared to Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) group. At 7 days post-IAM, the AT-Muse group showed significantly more arterioles and capillaries than the Vehicle group. Co-localization of PKH26+ cells with desmin, sarcomeric actin and troponin T implied the differentiation of Muse cells to a cardiac fate; moreover, PKH26+ cells also co-localized with a lectin marker, suggesting a possible differentiation to a vascular lineage.\nIntramyocardially administered AT-Muse cells displayed a significant neovascularization activity and survival capacity in an ovine model of AMI.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2023-01-21", "authors": ["Martha GCastillo", "Tom\u00e1s MPeralta", "PaolaLocatelli", "CandelaVelazquez", "YamilaHerrero", "Alberto JCrottogini", "Fernanda DOlea", "Luis ACuniberti"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0277442\n10.1038/s41569-018-0036-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303614\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.05.009\n10.1152/physrev.00019.2015\n10.3390/ijms21197301\n10.1073/pnas.0911647107\n10.1016/j.reth.2020.04.011\n10.1089/scd.2013.0473\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311648\n10.1371/journal.pone.0265347\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.01.098\n10.1253/circj.CJ-17-0552\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064752\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304348\n10.17226/12910\n10.1038/gt.2015.28\n10.3390/ani12060749\n10.1038/nmeth.2089\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2021.10.030\n10.1159/000099618\n10.1371/journal.pone.0218081\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.01.095\n10.1152/ajpheart.00363.2005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0053764\n10.1016/j.omtm.2019.05.004"}

Thus far, single-scale topographies with a broad range of feature shapes and dimensions have been utilized including grooves, pillars, and fibers. This study reports for the first time a hierarchical structure composed of nano-pillars (nPs) on micro-wrinkles (\u00b5Ws) for effective maturation of CMs. Through capillary force lithography followed by a wrinkling process, vast size ranges of topographies are fabricated, and the responses of CMs are systematically investigated. Maturation of CMs on the hierarchical structures is highly enhanced compared to a single-scale topography: cardiac differentiation of H9C2s (rat cardiomyocytes) on the hierarchical topography is \u2248 2.8 and \u2248 1.9 times higher than those consisting of single-scale \u00b5Ws and nPs. Both nPs and \u00b5Ws have important roles in cardiac maturation, and the aspect ratio (height/diameter) of the nPs and the wavelength of the \u00b5Ws are important in CM maturation. This enhancement is caused by strong focal adhesion and nucleus mediated mechanotransduction of CMs from the confinement effects of the different wavelengths of \u00b5Ws and the cellular membrane protrusion on the nPs.

However, trastuzumab increases the risk of cardiac complications without affecting myocardial structure, suggesting a distinct mechanism of cardiotoxicity.\nWe used medium from trastuzumab-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to treat CCC-HEH-2 cells, the human embryonic cardiac tissue-derived cell lines, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to assess the crosstalk between vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and cardiomyocytes. Protein mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the key factors from VECs that regulate the function of cardiomyocytes. We applied RNA-sequencing to clarify the mechanism, by which PTX3 causes cardiac dysfunction. We used an anti-human/rat HER2 (neu) monoclonal antibody to generate a rat model that was used to evaluate the effects of trastuzumab on cardiac structure and function and the rescue effects of lapatinib on trastuzumab-induced cardiac side effects. Medium from trastuzumab-treated HUVECs apparently impaired the contractility of CCC-HEH-2 cells and iPSC-CMs. PTX3 from VECs caused defective cardiomyocyte contractility and cardiac dysfunction in mice, phenocopying trastuzumab treatment. PTX3 affected calcium homoeostasis in cardiomyocytes, which led to defective contractile properties. EGFR/STAT3 signalling in VECs contributed to the increased expression and release of PTX3. Notably, lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of EGFR/HER2, could rescue the cardiac complications caused by trastuzumab by blocking the release of PTX3.\nWe identified a distinct mode of cardiotoxicity, wherein the activation of EGFR/STAT3 signalling by trastuzumab in VECs promotes PTX3 excretion, which contributes to the impaired contractility of cardiomyocytes by inhibiting cellular calcium signalling. We confirmed that lapatinib could be a feasible preventive agent against trastuzumab-induced cardiac complications and provided the rationale for the combined application of lapatinib and trastuzumab in cancer therapy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2023-01-19", "authors": ["ZhifeiXu", "ZizhengGao", "HuangxiFu", "YanZeng", "YingJin", "BoXu", "YuantengZhang", "ZezhengPan", "XueqinChen", "XiaochenZhang", "XiaohongWang", "HaoYan", "XiaochunYang", "BoYang", "QiaojunHe", "PeihuaLuo"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvad012"}

The focus of this research was to elucidate the curative effects of two different doses of UMB\u00a0on diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in a type 2 diabetic rat model induced by 50\u2009mg/kg body weight of streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic rats orally received 10 or 30\u2009mg/kg of UMB\u00a0daily for 8 weeks. Compared to the nontreated diabetic group, both UMB treatment doses significantly decreased glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), cardiovascular risk indices, and oxidative stress by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes. The hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia also dramatically decreased in diabetic groups with UMB treatments accompanied by an improvement in insulin, and insulin sensitivity indices (HOMA-IR and QUICKI). Furthermore, the cardiac gene expressions and protein levels of Janus kinase2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3), and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) were also markedly downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by UMB treatments. Finally, the biochemical results were assured by the reduction of histological alterations in cardiac tissues.

Infection with this blood parasite has been confirmed in many armadillo species; however, information on infection in Zaedyus pichiy, a small armadillo that inhabits areas endemic to Chagas disease, is scarce. Our objective was to determine the infection frequency and parasite load of T. cruzi in 49 wild Z. pichiy confiscated dead from poachers in Mendoza, Argentina, 2010-2017. We detected T. cruzi DNA in 32 of 49 armadillos (65%) using real-time PCR, confirming infection with T. cruzi in a high proportion of confiscated pichis. No differences were found related to sex, age, or ecoregion origin of the assessed pichis. Parasite loads ranged between <0.1 and 8.88 parasite equivalents/microgram cardiac tissue. Additional studies on the infection status of Z. pichiy are needed to determine their role in the maintenance of the sylvatic transmission cycle and the potential zoonotic risk from hunted pichis.", "journal": "Journal of wildlife diseases", "date": "2023-01-18", "authors": ["Melisa EMorales", "Catalina Mu\u00f1oz-SanMart\u00edn", "Pedro ECattan", "MariellaSuperina"], "doi": "10.7589/JWD-D-22-00077"}
{"title": "Exogenous fetuin-A protects against sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation in mice.", "abstract": "Sepsis-induced myocardial injury is a consequence of septicemia and is one of the major causes of death in intensive care units. A serum glycoprotein called fetuin-A is secreted largely by the liver, tongue, placenta, and adipose tissue. Fetuin-A has a variety of biological and pharmacological properties. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant glycoprotein fetuin-A has shown its efficacy in a number of inflammatory disorders including sepsis. However, its protective role against sepsis-induced myocardial injury remains elusive. The purpose of this work is to explore the role of fetuin-A in mouse models of myocardial injury brought on by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CLP significantly induced the myocardial injury assessed in terms of elevated myocardial markers (serum CK-MB, cTnI levels), inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) in the serum, and oxidative stress markers (increased MDA levels and decreased reduced glutathione) in heart tissue homogenate following 24\u2009h of ligation and puncture. Further, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed considerable histological alterations in the myocardial tissue of sepsis-developed mice. Interestingly, fetuin-A pretreatment (50 and 100\u2009mg/kg) for 4\u2009days before the CLP procedure significantly improved the myocardial injury and was evaluated in perspective of a reduction in the CK-MB, cTnI levels, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in sepsis-developed animals. Fetuin-A pretreatment significantly attenuated the oxidative stress and improved the myocardial morphology in a dose-dependent manner. The present study provides preliminary evidence that fetuin-A exerts protection against sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction in vivo via suppression of inflammation and oxidative damage.", "journal": "Fundamental & clinical pharmacology", "date": "2023-01-18", "authors": ["VSidheeque Hassan", "MohdHanifa", "UmashankerNavik", "AnjanaBali"], "doi": "10.1111/fcp.12870"}

Pathological cardiac remodeling in the myocardium of HCM patients may progress to heart failure. An in-depth elucidation of the lineage-specific changes in pathological cardiac remodeling of HCM is pivotal for the development of therapies to mitigate the progression. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq of the cardiac tissues from HCM patients or healthy donors and conducted spatial transcriptomic assays on tissue sections from patients. Unbiased clustering of 55,122 nuclei from HCM and healthy conditions revealed 9 cell lineages and 28 clusters. Lineage-specific changes in gene expression, subpopulation composition, and intercellular communication in HCM were discovered through comparative analyses. According to the results of pseudotime ordering, differential expression analysis, and differential regulatory network analysis, potential key genes during the transition towards a failing state of cardiomyocytes such as FGF12, IL31RA, and CREB5 were identified. Transcriptomic dynamics underlying cardiac fibroblast activation were also uncovered, and potential key genes involved in cardiac fibrosis were obtained such as AEBP1, RUNX1, MEOX1, LEF1, and NRXN3. Using the spatial transcriptomic data, spatial activity patterns of the candidate genes, pathways, and subpopulations were confirmed on patient tissue sections. Moreover, we showed experimental evidence that in vitro knockdown of AEBP1 could promote the activation of human cardiac fibroblasts, and overexpression of AEBP1 could attenuate the TGF\u03b2-induced activation.

Besides, the reliability of GAPDH was further examined by Western blot. Additionally, unstable housekeeping genes were found in other animal models of cardiovascular medicine. We also found that sodium dodecyl sulfate and temperature significantly impacted the results of Ponceau S staining. Membranes stained with Ponceau S after immunodetection could avoid this interference, and the coefficients of variation for post-immunodetection staining are lower than those produced by GAPDH immunodetection.

Therefore, we assessed the effect of moderately rich sugar diet coupled with environmental chemical exposure on the development and progression of T2D using Drosophila as a model organism.\nWe reared newly eclosed Drosophila males on a diet containing atrazine (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; non-traditional risk factor) and/or moderately high sucrose (0.5\u00a0M/1\u00a0M; to mimic binge eating, Traditional risk factor) for 20-30\u00a0days. Subsequently, we assessed diabetic parameters, oxidative stress parameters and also the abundance of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) along with their receptor (RAGE) in these flies. For diabetic cardiomyopathy, we examined the pericardin (tissue fibrosis marker) level in Drosophila heart.\nFlies reared on 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml atrazine alone showed T2D hallmarks at 30\u00a0days. In contrast, flies reared on 0.5\u00a0M sucrose+ 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml atrazine showed insulin resistance characterized by hyperglycemia and increased Drosophila insulin-like peptides along with reduced insulin signaling at 20\u00a0days, similar to those reared on high sucrose diet. In addition, both groups had high levels of oxidative stress and showed starvation response (converting triglycerides into fatty acids). Alarmingly, flies fed with sucrose+atrazine for 20 and 30\u00a0days had elevated pericardin in heart tissues, indicating early onset of diabetic complications such as cardiomyopathy.\nLifestyle-chemical exposure synergistically impairs glucose metabolism, affects organisms' redox state and leads to the early onset of T2D and associated complications like cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2023-01-15", "authors": ["Himanshu PawankumarGupta", "Mirat-UlFatima", "RukmaniPandey", "KristipatiRavi Ram"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121370"}

{"title": "Toll-like receptor 9 signaling after myocardial infarction: Role of p66ShcA adaptor protein.", "abstract": "During myocardial infarction, cellular debris is released, causing a sterile inflammation via pattern recognition receptors. These reactions amplify damage and promotes secondary heart failure. The pattern recognition receptor, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) detects immunogenic fragments of endogenous DNA, inducing inflammation by NF\u03baB. The p66ShcA adaptor protein plays an important role in both ischemic myocardial damage and immune responses. We hypothesized that p66ShcA adaptor protein promotes DNA-sensing signaling via the TLR9 pathway after myocardial infarction. TLR9 protein expression increased in cardiac tissue from patients with end-stage heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia in mice in\u00a0vivo induced gene expression of key TLR9 pathway proteins (MyD88 and Unc93b1). In this model, a functional link between TLR9 and p66ShcA was revealed as; (i) ischemia-induced upregulation of TLR9 protein was abrogated in myocardium of p66ShcA knockout mice; (ii) when p66ShcA was overexpressed in NFkB reporter cells stably expressing TLR9, NFkB-activation increased during stimulation with the TLR9 agonist CpG B; (iii) in cardiac fibroblasts, p66ShcA overexpression caused TLR9 upregulation. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that ShcA proteins and TLR9 may be found in the same protein complex, which was dissipated upon TLR9 stimulation in\u00a0vivo. A proximity assay confirmed the co-localization of TLR9 and ShcA proteins. The systemic immune response after myocardial ischemia was dampened in p66ShcA knockout mice as interleukin-4, -17 and\u00a0-22 expression in mononuclear cells isolated from spleens was reduced. In conclusion, p66ShcA adaptor may be an interaction partner and a regulator of the TLR9 pathway post-infarction.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2023-01-13", "authors": ["AntonBaysa", "Azzam AMaghazachi", "Kristin LarsenSand", "MarikaCampesan", "TaniaZaglia", "MarcoMongillo", "MarcoGiorgio", "FabioDi Lisa", "LarsGullestad", "Lars HMariero", "JarleVaage", "GuroValen", "K\u00e5re-OlavStensl\u00f8kken"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.12.085"}

We aim to study the molecular mechanisms and effects on cardiac function in rodents with HFrEF of a designer diet in which free essential amino acids-in specifically designed percentages-substituted for protein.\nWild-type mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce left ventricle (LV) pressure overload or sham surgery. Whole-body glucose homeostasis was studied with glucose tolerance test, while myocardial dysfunction and fibrosis were measured with echocardiogram and histological analysis. Mitochondrial bioenergetics and morphology were investigated with oxygen consumption rate measurement and electron microscopy evaluation. Circulating and cardiac non-targeted metabolite profiles were analyzed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, while RNA-sequencing was used to identify signalling pathways mainly affected. The amino acid-substituted diet shows remarkable preventive and therapeutic effects. This dietary approach corrects the whole-body glucose metabolism and restores the unbalanced metabolic substrate usage-by improving mitochondrial fuel oxidation-in the failing heart. In particular, biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches suggest that renormalization of branched-chain amino acid oxidation in cardiac tissue, which is suppressed in HFrEF, plays a relevant role. Beyond the changes of systemic metabolism, cell-autonomous processes may explain at least in part the diet's cardioprotective impact.\nCollectively, these results suggest that manipulation of dietary amino acids, and especially essential amino acids, is a potential adjuvant therapeutic strategy to treat systolic dysfunction and HFrEF in humans.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2023-01-11", "authors": ["MaurizioRagni", "Carolina MagdalenGreco", "AriannaFelicetta", "Shuxun VincentRen", "PaoloKunderfranco", "ChiaraRuocco", "PierluigiCarullo", "VeronicaLarcher", "LauraTedesco", "IleniaSeveri", "AntonioGiordano", "SaverioCinti", "AlessandraValerio", "HaipengSun", "YibinWang", "ChenGao", "GianluigiCondorelli", "EnzoNisoli"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvad005"}

We think that cardiac manifestations in some cases of pyrethroid poisoning are due to the concomitant piperonylbutoxide toxicity and its possible effect on norepinephrine release from adrenal gland, which might explain changes in cardiac findings.

Indeed, several mitochondrial pathways result impaired in CVDs, showing ATP depletion and ROS production as common traits of cardiac tissue degeneration. Thus, targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes can represent a successful strategy to prevent heart failure. In this context, the identification of new pharmacological targets among mitochondrial proteins paves the way for the design of new selective drugs. Thanks to the advances in omics approaches, to a greater availability of mitochondrial crystallized protein structures and to the development of new computational approaches for protein 3D-modelling and drug design, it is now possible to investigate in detail impaired mitochondrial pathways in CVDs. Furthermore, it is possible to design new powerful drugs able to hit the selected pharmacological targets in a highly selective way to rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and prevent cardiac tissue degeneration. The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the onset of CVDs appears increasingly evident, as reflected by the impairment of proteins involved in lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dynamics, respiratory chain complexes, and membrane polarization maintenance in CVD patients. Conversely, little is known about proteins responsible for the cross-talk between mitochondria and cytoplasm in cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial transporters of the SLC25A family, in particular, are responsible for the translocation of nucleotides (e.g., ATP), amino acids (e.g., aspartate, glutamate, ornithine), organic acids (e.g. malate and 2-oxoglutarate), and other cofactors (e.g., inorganic phosphate, NAD", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2023-01-06", "authors": ["SimonaTodisco", "BiagiaMusio", "VitoPesce", "Maria MaddalenaCavalluzzi", "GiuseppePetrosillo", "GianluigiLa Piana", "Maria NoemiSgobba", "NikolaSchlosserov\u00e1", "LucasCafferati Beltrame", "RosaDi Lorenzo", "VincenzoTragni", "DomenicoMarzulli", "LorenzoGuerra", "AnnaDe Grassi", "VitoGallo", "MariateresaVolpicella", "Luigi LeonardoPalese", "GiovanniLentini", "Ciro LeonardoPierri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2022.115405"}

Although quantitative RT-PCR can provide an indication of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor density and subtype expression, mRNA levels do not always correlate with functional protein levels.

MI is accompanied by oxidative, inflammatory, apoptotic, and fibrotic insults. Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is a polyphenolic compound with various potent biological activities. In this study, we explored the possible cardioprotective role of PCA against isoproterenol (ISO)-mediated MI. Rats were either injected with ISO (85\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously) or pretreated with PCA (100 or 200\u2009mg/kg, orally). PCA supplementation markedly normalized ISO-induced disturbed cardiac function markers (creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T). Notably, PCA administration exerted remarkable increases in glutathione and its derived enzymes, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, as well as decreases in malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels in the injured cardiac tissue. The molecular findings validated the augmented cellular antioxidative capacity by PCA via increasing the gene expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1. The cardioprotective efficacy of PCA extended to suppress cardiac inflammation as demonstrated by the decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and nuclear factor kappa B. Additionally, PCA prevented cardiomyocyte loss and fibrosis by decreasing Bax, caspase-3, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and matrix metalloproteinase-9, and enhancing B-cell lymphoma 2 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-3. The cardiac histological screening further confirmed the PCA's protective action. The obtained data recommend PCA as an alternative therapeutic agent to attenuate the molecular, biochemical, and histological alterations associated with MI development.", "journal": "Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology", "date": "2023-01-04", "authors": ["LiLi", "HuaMa", "YichongZhang", "HaitaoJiang", "BihuaXia", "Hassan AlSberi", "Mohamed AElhefny", "Maha SLokman", "Rami BKassab"], "doi": "10.1002/jbt.23270"}
{"title": "Calanus oil attenuates isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy by regulating myocardial remodeling and oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Calanus oil, an oil extracted from the marine crustacean Calanus finmarchicus, is one of the richest sources of omega-3 and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Although calanus oil has been shown to have a significant anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-obesity effects in various cardiovascular diseases, but little is known about its effect on pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, the present study was carried out to evaluate the therapeutic effect of calanus oil on cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by subcutaneous injections with isoproterenol (5 mg/kg b.w) for 14 consecutive days. Calanus oil (400 mg/kg) was given orally for 4\u00a0weeks. Cardiac pathological remodeling was evaluated by echocardiography, after which morphometric, biochemical, histological and ultrastructural analyses were performed. Calanus oil treatment significantly ameliorated isoproterenol-induced structural and functional alterations in echocardiography. Calanus oil also reduced the relative heart weight, significantly decreased the elevated cardiac enzymes (LDH and CK-MB) and the lipid peroxidation marker (MDA), augmented the myocardial antioxidant status (TAC), and ameliorated the histopathological and ultrastructural changes in cardiac tissues and prevented interstitial collagen deposition. The present study, for the first time, provided morphometric, biochemical, histological and ultrastructural evidences supporting the promising anti-hypertrophic effect of calanus oil against ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This anti-hypertrophic effect of calanus oil is via regulating myocardial remodeling and oxidative stress.

In this context, the current study was designed to investigate rabbit decellularized derma's similarity with human decellularized skin in terms of mechanical properties for cardiac tissue engineering application.\nFifty two rabbit dermal specimens were provided and divided into two groups: the experimental (decellularized) group and the control (group). Similarly, twelve human skin specimens were divided into the experimental (decellularized) and control groups. Initially, the effect of decellularization on the mechanical performance of scaffolds was analyzed. Then, the mechanical strength of decellularized rabbit skin was compared to decellularized human derma by measuring the stress strain and Young's modulus of the samples.\nThe results showed that rabbit decellularized skin has a similar elastic range to human decellularized skin, despite being more elastic (\nAccording to the results of this study and the similarities of rabbit decellularized derm to human skin and its advantages over it, along with the biological complexity of native cardiac ECM, this scaffold can be used as an alternative matrix for tissue-engineered cardiac patches.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular and thoracic research", "date": "2023-01-01", "authors": ["MaryamMousavi Khatat", "SaeidehSame", "KeyvanMoharamzadeh", "JafarSoleimani Rad", "AhmadMehdipour", "LeilaRoshangar"], "doi": "10.34172/jcvtr.2023.32926\n10.3389/fcvm.2020.610364\n10.1007/s40778-017-0075-7\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00050\n10.1038/s41536-021-00140-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.054\n10.12968/jowc.2016.25.Sup4.S17\n10.1097/prs.0000000000002643\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.09.061\n10.1007/s00405-016-4088-0\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.02.008\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.013\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.016\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.025\n10.3390/polym12040844\n10.15171/apb.2018.005\n10.3390/molecules24050907\n10.1159/000255597\n10.1007/s10561-012-9340-2\n10.1080/21655979.2015.1036202\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.01.033\n10.1115/1.3168354\n10.1016/0007-1226(91)90199-t"}

Studying pathological heart tissue demands accurate histological and immunohistochemical stainings in animal models, including chromogenic and fluorescent approaches. Moreover, a reliable set of healthy heart stainings and labeling are required, in order to provide a reference for the pathological situation. Heart and brain tissue of a healthy rabbit were collected, and different histological key steps were compared, such as paraffin embedding after formalin fixation versus cryopreservation; an antigen retrieval (AR) step in processing paraffin sections versus the same procedure without AR; or a chromogenic with a fluorescent detection system, respectively. Using serial sections, we stained the same morphological structure with classic approaches (HE, Masson Goldner Trichrome (GT) and Elastica van Gieson (EL)) and with different markers, including collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, \u03b1-SMA, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) which is an inflammation-related marker, and ki67 for proliferating cells. Differences between conditions were quantitatively assessed by measuring the color intensity. Generally, cryosections exhibited a more prominent signal intensity in immunohistochemically labeled sections than in paraffin sections, but the strong staining was slurry, which sometimes impeded proper identification of morphological structures, particularly at higher magnifications. In addition, the advantage of an AR step was observed when compared to the condition without AR, where signal intensities were significantly lower. Different stainings of the heart arteries and the myocardium revealed a clear distribution of extracellular matrix components, with prominent collagen III in the artery wall, but an absence of collagen III in the myocardium. Moreover, paraffin-embedded sections provided more distinct structures compared to cryosections after collagen III, ki67, fibronectin, and \u03b1-SMA labeling. As for the Purkinje cells that were depicted in the heart and the cerebellum (Purkinje neurons), we found GT staining most suitable to depict them in the heart, while HE as well as EL staining was ideal to depict Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. In sum, we provide useful reference images with different stainings for researchers using the rabbit heart or brain model.

{"title": "Toll-like receptor-2 in cardiomyocytes and macrophages mediates isoproterenol-induced cardiac inflammation and remodeling.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Activation of the innate immune system initiates an inflammatory response during cardiac remodeling induced by isoproterenol (ISO). Here, we investigated whether Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) mediates ISO-induced inflammation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. TLR2 was found to be increased in the heart tissues of mouse with HF under ISO challenge. Further, cardiomyocytes and macrophages were identified as the main cellular sources of the increased TLR2 levels in the model under ISO stimulation. The effect of TLR2 deficiency on ISO-induced cardiac remodeling was determined using TLR2 knockout mice and bone marrow transplantation models. In vitro studies involving ISO-treated cultured cardiomyocytes and macrophages showed that TLR2 knockdown significantly decreased ISO-induced cell inflammation and remodeling via MAPKs/NF-\u03baB signaling. Mechanistically, ISO significantly increased the TLR2-MyD88 interaction in the above cells in a TLR1-dependent manner. Finally, DAMPs, such as HSP70 and fibronectin 1 (FN1), were found to be released from the cells under ISO stimulation, which further activated TLR1/2-Myd88 signaling and subsequently activated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and cardiac remodeling. In summary, our findings suggest that TLR2 may be a target for the alleviation of chronic adrenergic stimulation-associated HF.

This study aimed to investigate the myocardial damage in an isoprenaline (ISO)-induced MI mice model during HAM treatment. The heart injury was evaluated by assaying serum CK-MB, Tn-I and observing histopathological changes. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in serum were detected. The level of p-P65 and the expression of proteins in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway were assayed with Western blot.

{"title": "Succinate level is increased and succinate dehydrogenase exerts forward and reverse catalytic activities in lipopolysaccharides-stimulated cardiac tissue: The protective role of dimethyl malonate.", "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the alterations of myocardial succinate and fumarate levels with or without succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitor dimethyl malonate during 24\u00a0h of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) challenge, as well as the effects of dimethyl malonate on the impaired cardiac tissue. Myocardial succinate and fumarate levels were increased in the initial 9\u00a0h of LPS challenge. During this time, dimethyl malonate increased the succinate level, decreased the fumarate level, aggravated the cardiac dysfunction, reduced the oxidative stress, had little effect on interleukin-1\u03b2 production, promoted interleukin-10 production and bothered the ATP production. Co-treatment with exogenous succinate significantly increased interleukin-1\u03b2 production in this period. After 12\u00a0h of LPS challenge, myocardial the succinate level increased sharply, while the fumarate level gradually decreased. During 12-24\u00a0h of LPS challenge, dimethyl malonate effectively reduced the succinate level, increased the fumarate level, improved cardiac dysfunction, inhibited interleukin-1\u03b2 production, and had little effect on oxidative stress, interleukin-10 production, and ATP production. LPS challenge also significantly increased the myocardial succinate receptor 1 expression and circulating succinate level. Inhibition of succinate receptor 1 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of interleukin-1\u03b2. In conclusion, the current study suggests that myocardial succinate accumulates during LPS challenge, and that SDH activity may be transformed (from forward to reversed) and involved in a line of stress response. Dimethyl malonate inhibits SDH and, depending on the time of treatment, reduces LPS-induced cardiac impairment. Furthermore, accumulated succinate exerts pro-inflammatory effects partly via succinate receptor 1 signaling.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2022-12-23", "authors": ["YuWang", "HongmeiTao", "WenjingTang", "SiqiWu", "YinTang", "LingLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.175472"}

Here we identify a profibrotic coagulation signaling pathway that can be targeted for improved cardiac function following MI with persistent ischemia. Quantitative phosphoproteomics of cardiac tissue revealed an upregulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in human IHF. Intervention in this pathway with trametinib improves myocardial function and prevents fibrotic remodeling in a murine model of non-reperfused MI. MAPK activation in MI requires myeloid cell signaling of protease-activated receptor 2 linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the coagulation initiator tissue factor (TF). They act upstream of pro-oxidant NOX2 NADPH oxidase, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and activation of profibrotic TGF-\u03b21. Specific targeting with the TF inhibitor nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (NAPc2) starting 1 day after established experimental MI averts IHF.

At present, reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis is a crucial therapeutic strategy for ameliorating MI/R injury. However, there is a lack of drugs targeting oxidative stress and apoptosis for the clinical therapy of MI/R. Bergenin is a reportedly effective agent with antioxidative and antiapoptotic activity against acute injury. Nevertheless, the roles and potential mechanisms of bergenin against MI/R injury remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that bergenin attenuated MI/R-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via SIRT1. Mice were subjected to MI/R and treated with bergenin, after which the cardiac function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, LDH release, and MDA content were evaluated. In vitro, myocardial injury model of H9c2 cells was induced by simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SI/R), apoptosis and oxidative stress was decreased after treated with bergenin. Bergenin significantly reduced myocardial apoptosis and ROS generation in vitro and improved cardiac function in vivo. Intriguingly, bergenin remarkably decreased apoptosis in cardiac tissue accompanied by SIRT1 upregulation following MI/R injury. Further studies showed that inhibiting SIRT1 blocked bergenin's beneficial impact against apoptosis following SI/R injury through excessive oxidative stress and depression of the Bcl2 to Bax ratio.

Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue-sensor platform, composed of a bipillar-grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT, is first introduced. Two pillars are three-dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge-embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self-assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi-channel electronic system allows for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue-sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants.

Cardiac tissue was harvested from 10 age-matched males, either with a history of IHF or nonfailing (NF) controls that had no history of structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. Clinical measures before cardiac biopsy demonstrated significant differences in measures of ejection fraction and left ventricular dimensions. Myofibrils and myosin were extracted from left ventricular free wall cardiac samples. There were no changes in myofibrillar ATPase activity or calcium sensitivity between groups. Using isolated myosin, we found a 15% reduction in the IHF group in actin sliding velocity in the in vitro motility assay, which was observed in the absence of a myosin isoform shift. Oxidative damage (carbonylation) of isolated myosin was compared, in which there were no significant differences between groups. Synthetic thick filaments were formed from purified myosin and the ATPase activity was similar in both basal and actin-activated conditions (20 \u00b5M actin). Correlation analysis and Deming linear regression were performed between all studied parameters, in which we found statistically significant correlations between clinical measures of contractility with molecular measures of sliding velocity and ELC carbonylation.

{"title": "Sinapic Acid Attenuated Cisplatin-Induced Cardiotoxicity by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and \u0130nflammation with GPX4-Mediated NF-kB Modulation.", "abstract": "The use of cisplatin is severely limited by the risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Sinapic acid may reduce cisplatin's side effects. The anti oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and peroxynitrite-scavenging properties of sinapic acid could provide protection against the cardiotoxicity caused by cisplatin. To induce toxicity in rats, cisplatin was administered for a period of 5\u00a0weeks. Animal electrocardiograms were obtained after cisplatin toxicity had taken effect. Blood samples and heart tissues were then harvested from the anesthetized animals. The ELISA technique was used to evaluate the level of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative and nitrosative stress indicators in the heart tissue and serum. A real-time PCR was used to analyze GPX4 and NF-\u03baB expression in the heart tissue. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome were also utilized. Electrocardiograms data showed an increase in QRS and QT intervals. Biochemically, cisplatin increased oxidative, nitrosative, and proinflammatory cytokine levels. Animals exposed to cisplatin had histopathological findings in the heart tissue, according to the results of histological assessment. Sinapic acid reduced TNF-alpha, interleukin-6, malondialdehyde, and ischemia-modified albumin. Sinapic acid also reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress. Furthermore, Sinapic acid restored lengthy QT and QRS. Cisplatin-treated rats had higher NF-\u03baB activation than controls. This effect was successfully inhibited by sinapic acid. Histopathologically, tissues treated with sinapic acid were less damaged than tissues treated with cisplatin. In conclusion, our results suggest that sinapic acid exhibited a protective effect against the cardiotoxicity induced by cisplatin. These effects may be caused by the overexpression of GPX4 and the downregulation of NF-KB, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2022-12-16", "authors": ["CanerYildirim", "SibelCangi", "MustafaOrkmez", "Senay GorucuYilmaz", "Mehmet AkifBozday\u0131", "HaticeYamaner", "SenaCevik"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-022-09773-3\n10.1620/tjem.219.177\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2244\n10.1080/02841860902806609\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.09.085\n10.1016/j.phrs.2005.12.005\n10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154331\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042\n10.1007/s11033-021-06367-0\n10.1155/2016/3571614\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.06.085\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112412\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.014\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.12.022\n10.4103/jpbs.JPBS_220_19\n10.3389/fphar.2020.01119\n10.3389/fphar.2017.00196\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112412\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.08.026\n10.1007/s11356-016-7168-1\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2003.11.015\n10.1016/j.tjog.2020.10.004\n10.1042/bj3300719\n10.2337/diab.38.12.1539\n10.1016/0003-2697(87)90021-2\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.18632/oncotarget.25008\n10.1002/jbt.22556\n10.1371/journal.pone.0115682\n10.3390/antiox9111163\n10.1155/2020/3921796\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.05.003\n10.1016/j.cbi.2013.11.008\n10.1021/jf020496z\n10.1152/physrev.00029.2006\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705384\n10.1124/jpet.102.047522\n10.1016/j.tox.2016.10.001\n10.1172/JCI200215606\n10.1080/0886022X.2016.1229996\n10.1007/s12272-018-1006-6\n10.1097/MD.0000000000007681\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.11.028\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079426\n10.1074/jbc.M115.680090\n10.1016/S0891-5849(03)00466-0\n10.1038/s41419-019-2061-8\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.006\n10.1002/cbin.11121\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226928"}

{"title": "An efficient combination immunotherapy for antitumor immunity without accelerating cardiac allograft rejection.", "abstract": "Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including antibodies against programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its receptor programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), represents a promising systematic treatment for advanced human malignancies. Transplantation remains the ultimate therapy for end-stage organ diseases. However, the efficacy of ICI treatment in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remains controversial. We established a transgenic primary liver cancer mouse model and performed allogeneic heterotopic heart transplantation. Different treatments were performed and survival curves were calculated. Graft samples were collected, and immune cells and the cell surface expression of PD-L1 were analysed by flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum were measured by an inflammatory array. The specificity of the histochemical techniques was tested by staining sections. A combination immunotherapy comprising a BET protein inhibitor (JQ1) and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 antibody) was administered to primary liver cancer model mice bearing cardiac allografts. Interestingly, the combination immunotherapy effectively suppressed the progression of primary liver cancer but did not accelerate allograft rejection. In accordance with our previous findings, BET protein inhibition enhances the expression of a putative membrane transporter (Rab8A), which upregulates the expression of PD-L1 on the plasma membrane in a transgenic primary liver cancer mouse model. This may be a crucial mechanism of tumour progression arrest. Our data showed that heart transplantation upregulated the expression of the proinflammatory factor IFN-\u03b3 and suggested that BET protein inhibition (with JQ1) decreased PD-L1 expression in heart tissues after cardiac transplantation. This phenomenon was accompanied by enhanced infiltration of inflammatory IFN-\u03b3. Our study provides a novel and efficient therapeutic strategy for SOT recipients.", "journal": "Immunology", "date": "2022-12-15", "authors": ["XiaolongMiao", "ZelaiWu", "YuancongJiang", "HanLiu", "WeihuaGong"], "doi": "10.1111/imm.13618"}
{"title": "Experimental heart failure models in small animals.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most critical health and economic burdens worldwide, and its prevalence is continuously increasing. HF is a disease that occurs due to a pathological change arising from the function or structure of the heart tissue and usually progresses. Numerous experimental HF models have been created to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause HF. An understanding of the pathophysiology of HF is essential for the development of novel efficient therapies. During the past few decades, animal models have provided new insights into the complex pathogenesis of HF. Success in the pathophysiology and treatment of HF has been achieved by using animal models of HF. The development of new in vivo models is critical for evaluating treatments such as gene therapy, mechanical devices, and new surgical approaches. However, each animal model has advantages and limitations, and none of these models is suitable for studying all aspects of HF. Therefore, the researchers have to choose an appropriate experimental model that will fully reflect HF. Despite some limitations, these animal models provided a significant advance in the etiology and pathogenesis of HF. Also, experimental HF models have led to the development of new treatments.

Inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis have important roles in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Minocycline (Min) is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. Here, the cardioprotective effects of Min against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity in adult male rats were evaluated.\nForty-two adult male rats were divided into six groups including control group (normal saline), Dox group, Min groups (Min 45\u00a0mg/kg and Min 90\u00a0mg/kg), and treatment groups (Dox\u00a0+\u00a0Min 45\u00a0mg/kg and Dox\u00a0+\u00a0Min 90\u00a0mg/kg). Dox (2.5\u00a0mg/kg) was administered three times a week for two weeks, and Min once a day for three weeks via intraperitoneal route. Cardiac tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) in serum as well as the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in cardiac tissue were measured. Cardiac tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were also measured using ELISA.\nCompared with the Dox group, treatment with Min significantly decreased the activity of LDH and CK-MB. Min also increased the activity of catalase and SOD in the tissue samples. The results showed that the levels of MDA, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in cardiac tissue samples were significantly lower in the Min groups compared with the Dox group. In addition, histopathological results showed that Min reduced the tissue damage caused by Dox.\nMin reduced Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.

{"title": "Metabolomic and transcriptomic studies of improvements in myocardial infarction due to Pycr1 deletion.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major challenge to cardiovascular health worldwide, with poor healing leaving a direct impact on patients' quality of life and survival. Metabolic abnormalities after MI are receiving increasing attention. Our previous studies showed that enhancing proline catabolism ameliorates hypoxic damage to myocardial cells; therefore, we sought to determine whether reducing the synthesis of endogenous proline also affects MI. We analysed GEO datasets associated with MI and western blot of mouse heart tissue in an MI model to demonstrate pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (Pycr1) expression level after MI. We constructed Pycr1 KO mice by CRISPR/Cas9 technology to explore the effect of Pycr1 gene KO after MI using transcriptomic and metabolomic techniques. In this study, we found reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of Pycr1 in the hearts of mice after MI. We observed that Pycr1 gene KO has a protective effect against MI, reducing the area of MI and improving heart function. Using transcriptomics approaches, we found 215 upregulated genes and 247 downregulated genes after KO of the Pycr1 gene, indicating that unsaturated fatty acid metabolism was affected at the transcriptional level. Metabolomics results revealed elevated content for 141 metabolites and decreased content for 90 metabolites, among which the levels of fatty acids, glycerol phospholipids, bile acids, and other metabolites increased significantly. The changes in these metabolites may be related to the protective effect of Pycr1 KO on the heart after MI. Pycr1 gene KO has a protective effect against MI and our research will lay a solid foundation for the development of future Pycr1-related drug targets.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2022-12-11", "authors": ["ZhiminXue", "YiwenPan", "XugangKong", "JiefangZhang", "DanyuWu", "BinquanZhou"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.17637"}
{"title": "Melatonin and metformin ameliorated trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity through the modulation of mitochondrial function and dynamics without reducing its anticancer efficacy.", "abstract": "Trastuzumab has an impressive level of efficacy as regards antineoplasticity, however it can cause serious cardiotoxic side effects manifested by impaired cardiac contractile function. Although several pharmacological interventions, including melatonin and metformin, have been reported to protect against various cardiovascular diseases, their potential roles in trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity remain elusive. We hypothesized that either melatonin or metformin co-treatment effectively attenuates trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity through attenuating the impaired mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dynamics. Male Wistar rats were divided into control (normal saline, n\u00a0=\u00a08) and trastuzumab group (4\u00a0mg/kg/day for 7\u00a0days, n\u00a0=\u00a024). Rats in the trastuzumab group were subdivided into 3 interventional groups (n\u00a0=\u00a08/group), and normal saline, or melatonin (10\u00a0mg/kg/day), or metformin (250\u00a0mg/kg/day) were orally administered for 7 consecutive days. Cardiac parameters were determined, and biochemical investigations were carried out on blood and heart tissues. Trastuzumab induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. It also impaired cardiac mitochondrial function, dynamics, and autophagy. Treatment with either melatonin or metformin equally attenuated trastuzumab-induced cardiac injury, indicated by a marked reduction in inflammation, oxidative damage, cardiac mitochondrial injury, mitochondrial dynamic imbalance, autophagy dysregulation, and apoptosis, leading to improved LV function, as demonstrated by increased LV ejection fraction. Melatonin and metformin conferred equal levels of cardioprotection against trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, which may provide novel and promising approaches for management of cardiotoxicity induced by trastuzumab.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

{"title": "The effects of resveratrol and melatonin on biochemical and molecular parameters in diabetic old female rat hearts.", "abstract": "The roles of melatonin and resveratrol-enhanced activation of SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1), GLUT4 (glucose transporter type 4), and PGC-1\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) in mediating the protective effects on the heart in aged female rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were investigated. 16-month-old 48 Wistar female rats were separated into 8 groups with equal numbers. Group 1: Control, Group 2: Resveratrol Control, Group 3: Melatonin Control, Group 4: Resveratrol and Melatonin Control, Group 5: Diabetes, Group 6: Diabetes Resveratrol, Group 7: Diabetes Melatonin, Group 8: Diabetes Resveratrol and Melatonin. A single dose of 40\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneal streptozotocin was injected into the rats of Groups 5, 6, 7, and 8 to induce experimental diabetes. Blood glucose levels were measured from the tail veins of the animals six days after the injections, using a diagnostic glucose kit. Rats with a blood glucose levels \u2265300\u00a0mg/dl were considered diabetic. 5\u00a0mg/kg/day of resveratrol (intraperitoneal) and melatonin (subcutaneous) were administered for four weeks.

Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected. Twenty MIS-C patients (aged 9-17, median 12\u00a0years) were included in the study. Heart involvement at onset was testified by hypotension/shock (55%), laboratory evidence of myocardial involvement (100%), reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiography (83%), and/or need for inotrope agents (40%); they all presented good clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic response to treatment. CMR was performed after a median interval of 3\u00a0months from discharge. Pericardial effusion and myocardial edema were found in 5% of patients. Mild residual left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was found in 20% of patients, all showing normal echocardiographic LVEF at discharge.

{"title": "Placental Inflammation Leads to Abnormal Embryonic Heart Development.", "abstract": "Placental heart development and embryonic heart development occur in parallel, and these organs have been proposed to exert reciprocal regulation during gestation. Poor placentation has been associated with congenital heart disease, an important cause of infant mortality. However, the mechanisms by which altered placental development can lead to congenital heart disease remain unresolved.\nIn this study, we use an in vivo neutrophil-driven placental inflammation model through antibody depletion of maternal circulating neutrophils at key stages during time-mated murine pregnancy: embryonic days 4.5 and 7.5. Pregnant mice were culled at embryonic day 14.5 to assess placental and embryonic heart development. A combination of flow cytometry, histology, and bulk RNA sequencing was used to assess placental immune cell composition and tissue architecture. We also used flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing to assess embryonic cardiac immune cells at embryonic day 14.5 and histology and gene analyses to investigate embryonic heart structure and development. In some cases, offspring were culled at postnatal days 5 and 28 to assess any postnatal cardiac changes in immune cells, structure, and cardiac function, as measured by echocardiography.\nIn the present study, we show that neutrophil-driven placental inflammation leads to inadequate placental development and loss of barrier function. Consequently, placental inflammatory monocytes of maternal origin become capable of migration to the embryonic heart and alter the normal composition of resident cardiac macrophages and cardiac tissue structure. This cardiac impairment continues into postnatal life, hindering normal tissue architecture and function. Last, we show that tempering placental inflammation can prevent this fetal cardiac defect and is sufficient to promote normal cardiac function in postnatal life.\nTaken together, these observations provide a mechanistic paradigm whereby neutrophil-driven inflammation in pregnancy can preclude normal embryonic heart development as a direct consequence of poor placental development, which has major implications on cardiac function into adult life.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2022-12-10", "authors": ["Eleanor JWard", "SerenaBert", "SilviaFanti", "Kerri MMalone", "Robert TMaughan", "ChristinaGkantsinikoudi", "FabricePrin", "Lia KarinaVolpato", "Anna PaulaPiovezan", "Gerard JGraham", "Neil PDufton", "MauroPerretti", "Federica MMarelli-Berg", "SuchitaNadkarni"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061934"}

Persistence is linked to 5' terminal deletions of viral genomic RNAs that have been detected together with minor populations of full-length genomes in human infections. In this study, we explored the functions and interactions of the different viral RNA forms found in persistently infected patients and their putative role(s) in pathogenesis. Since enterovirus cardiac pathogenesis is linked to the viral proteinase 2A, we investigated the effect of different terminal genomic RNA deletions on 2A activity. We discovered that 5' terminal deletions in CVB3 genomic RNAs decreased the levels of 2A proteinase activity but could not abrogate it. Using newly generated viral reporters encoding nano-luciferase, we found that 5' terminal deletions resulted in decreased levels of viral protein and RNA synthesis in singly transfected cardiomyocyte cultures. Unexpectedly, when full-length and terminally deleted forms were cotransfected into cardiomyocytes, a cooperative interaction was observed, leading to increased viral RNA and protein production. However, when viral infections were carried out in cells harboring 5' terminally deleted CVB3 RNAs, a decrease in infectious particle production was observed. Our results provide a possible explanation for the necessity of full-length viral genomes during persistent infection, as they would stimulate efficient viral replication compared to that of the deleted genomes alone. To avoid high levels of viral particle production that would trigger cellular immune activation and host cell death, the terminally deleted RNA forms act to limit the production of viral particles, possibly as ", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2022-12-09", "authors": ["AlexisBouin", "Michelle NVu", "AliAl-Hakeem", "Genevieve PTran", "Joseph H CNguyen", "Bert LSemler"], "doi": "10.1128/jvi.01426-22\n10.1016/j.meegid.2012.10.016\n10.1099/jgv.0.000911\n10.1016/0300-9084(88)90166-6\n10.1038/291547a0\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004825\n10.3390/jcm10040603\n10.1038/nrcardio.2015.108\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn296\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035966\n10.1161/01.cir.101.3.231\n10.1128/JCM.00820-13\n10.1128/JVI.79.11.7024-7041.2005\n10.1016/j.virol.2008.02.030\n10.1016/j.virol.2016.05.021\n10.1128/JVI.01774-07\n10.1038/6543\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.631093\n10.1016/0092-8674(90)90170-J\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.766022\n10.1073/pnas.89.1.314\n10.1172/JCI1972\n10.1128/JVI.00423-17\n10.1038/s41598-020-67648-5\n10.1017/s1355838201010044\n10.1128/JVI.01513-07\n10.1007/s40588-020-00138-4\n10.1016/S0065-3527(08)60279-1\n10.1038/s41467-019-11428-x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.06.026\n10.1128/JVI.01049-13"}

Insights on Heart Failure Development.", "abstract": "Coordinated and harmonic (synchronous) ventricular electrical activation is essential for better left ventricular systolic function. Intraventricular conduction abnormalities, such as left bundle branch block due to artificial cardiac pacing, lead to electromechanical \"dyssynchronopathy\" with deleterious structural and clinical consequences. The aim of this review was to describe and improve the understanding of all the processes connecting the several mechanisms involved in the development of artificially induced ventricular dyssynchrony by cardiac pacing, most known as pacing-induced cardiomyopathy (PiCM). The chronic effect of abnormal impulse conduction and nonphysiological ectopic activation by artificial cardiac pacing is suspected to affect metabolism and myocardial perfusion, triggering regional differences in the activation/contraction processes that cause electrical and structural remodeling due to damage, inflammation, and fibrosis of the cardiac tissue. The effect of artificial cardiac pacing on ventricular function and structure can be multifactorial, and biological factors underlying PiCM could affect the time and probability of developing the condition. PiCM has not been included in the traditional classification of cardiomyopathies, which can hinder detection. This article reviews the available evidence for pacing-induced cardiovascular disease, the current understanding of its pathophysiology, and reinforces the adverse effects of right ventricular pacing, especially right ventricular pacing burden (commonly measured in percentage) and its repercussion on ventricular contraction (reflected by the impact on left ventricular systolic function).

{"title": "Melatonin ameliorates myocardial infarction in obese diabetic individuals: The possible involvement of macrophage apoptotic factors.", "abstract": "In recent days, the hike in obesity-mediated epidemics across the globe and the prevalence of obesity-induced cardiovascular disease\u00a0has become one of the chief grounds for morbidity and mortality. This epidemic-driven detrimental events in the cardiac tissues start with the altered distribution and metabolism pattern of high-density lipoprotein\u00a0and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leading to cholesterol (oxidized LDL) deposition on the arterial wall and atherosclerotic plaque generation, followed by vascular spasms and infarction. Subsequently, obesity-triggered metabolic malfunctions induce free radical generation which may further trigger pro-inflammatory signaling and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells\u00a0transcriptional factor, thus inducing interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. This terrifying cardiomyopathy can be further aggravated in type 2 diabetes mellitus, thereby making\u00a0obese diabetic patients prone toward\u00a0the development of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in comparison to their nondiabetic counterparts. The accelerated oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, followed by apoptosis in obese diabetic individuals, causing progression of athero-thrombotic vascular disease. Being an efficient antioxidative and anti-inflammatory indolamine, melatonin effectively inhibits lipid peroxidation, pro-inflammatory reactions, thereby resolving free radical-induced myocardial damages along with maintaining antioxidant reservoir to preserve cardiovascular integrity. Prolonged melatonin treatment maintains balanced body weight and serum total cholesterol\u00a0concentration by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and promoting cholesterol catabolism. Additionally, melatonin promotes macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory state, providing a proper shield during the recovery period. Therefore, the protective role of melatonin in maintaining the lipid metabolism homeostasis and blocking the atherosclerotic plaque rupture could be targeted as the possible therapeutic strategy for the management of obesity-induced acute MI.

{"title": "Melatonin Attenuates Extracellular Matrix Accumulation and Cardiac Injury Manifested by Copper.", "abstract": "Copper-induced cardiac injury is not widely reported in spite of its ability to cause oxidative damage and tissue injury. Structural and morphological changes in the cardiac tissue are triggered via oxidative stress and inflammatory responses following copper exposure. The varied and unavoidable exposure of copper through contaminated food and water warrants a safe and effective agent against its harmful effects. Since the heart is highly sensitive to changes in the redox balance, the present study was undertaken to examine the protective effects of melatonin against copper-induced cardiac injury. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to 100\u00a0ppm of elemental copper via drinking water for 4\u00a0months. The cardiac tissue was evaluated for various biochemical, histological, and protein expression studies. Animals exposed to copper exhibited induced oxidative stress and cardiac injury compared to normal control. To this end, we found that melatonin treatment ameliorated copper-induced alterations in tissue oxidative variables like ROS, nitrate, MDA, and GSH. In addition, histological examinations unravelled decreased cardiac muscle dilation, atrophy, and cardiomyopathy in melatonin-treated rats. Furthermore, melatonin-treated rats were associated with reduced tissue copper levels, collagen deposition, \u03b1-SMA, and increased HO-1 expression as compared to rats exposed exclusively to copper. Moreover, the levels of NF-\u03baB and cardiac markers such as CK-MB, cTnI, and cTnT were found to be decreased in the melatonin-treated animals.

Furthermore, we recently published a multicenter prospective study, RESTAGE-HF (Remission from Stage D Heart Failure), demonstrating that LVAD support combined with standard HF medications induced remarkable cardiac structural and functional improvement, leading to high rates of LVAD weaning and excellent long-term outcomes. This intriguing phenomenon provides great translational and clinical promise, although the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this recovery are largely unknown.\nTo identify changes in signaling pathways operative in the normal and failing human heart and to molecularly characterize patients who respond favorably to LVAD unloading, we performed global RNA sequencing and phosphopeptide profiling of left ventricular tissue from 93 patients with HF undergoing LVAD implantation (25 responders and 68 nonresponders) and 12 nonfailing donor hearts. Patients were prospectively monitored through echocardiography to characterize their myocardial structure and function and identify responders and nonresponders.\nThese analyses identified 1341 transcripts and 288 phosphopeptides that are differentially regulated in cardiac tissue from nonfailing control samples and patients with HF. In addition, these unbiased molecular profiles identified a unique signature of 29 transcripts and 93 phosphopeptides in patients with HF that distinguished responders after LVAD unloading. Further analyses of these macromolecules highlighted differential regulation in 2 key pathways: cell cycle regulation and extracellular matrix/focal adhesions.\nThis is the first study to characterize changes in the nonfailing and failing human heart by integrating multiple -omics platforms to identify molecular indices defining patients capable of myocardial recovery.

In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue models produced using tissue engineering technology and human cells have outperformed conventional models. In particular, the integration of cell reprogramming techniques with bioengineering platforms (e.g., microfluidics, scaffolds, bioprinting, and biophysical stimuli) has facilitated the development of heart-ona- chip, cardiac spheroid/organoid, and engineered heart tissue (EHT) to recapitulate the structural and functional features of the native human heart.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and genistein (G) supplementation on oxidative stress, apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart tissue of elderly rats.\nIn this experimental study, 40 elderly female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0months and weighing 250\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0g were randomly divided into five groups of eight animals, including: (1) control (C), (2) sham (Sh), (3) HIIT, (4) HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0G and (5) G.

MSCs possess the ability to secrete soluble factors as well as lipid bound extracellular vesicles (EVs). MSCs have gained increased interest and attention as a result of their therapeutic properties, which are thought to be attributed to their secretome. However, while the use of MSCs as whole cells pose heterogeneity concerns and survival issues post-transplantation, such limitations are absent in cell-free EV-based treatments. EVs derived from MSCs are promising therapeutic agents for a range of clinical conditions and disorders owing to their immunomodulatory, pro-regenerative, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic activity. Recent successes with preclinical studies using EVs for repair and regeneration of damaged tissues such as cardiac tissue, lung, liver, pancreas, bone, skin, cornea, and blood diseases are discussed in this review. We also discuss delivery strategies of EVs using biomaterials as delivery vehicles through systemic or local administration. Despite its effectiveness in preclinical investigations, the application of MSC-EV in clinical settings will necessitate careful consideration surrounding issues such as: i) scalability and isolation, ii) biodistribution, iii) targeting specific tissues, iv) quantification and characterization, and v) safety and efficacy of dosage.

{"title": "How can the adult zebrafish and neonatal mice teach us about stimulating cardiac regeneration in the human heart?", "abstract": "The proliferative capacity of mammalian cardiomyocytes diminishes shortly after birth. In contrast, adult zebrafish and neonatal mice can regenerate cardiac tissues, highlighting new potential therapeutic avenues. Different factors have been found to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in zebrafish and neonatal mice;\u00a0these include maintenance of mononuclear and diploid cardiomyocytes and upregulation of the proto-oncogene c-Myc. The growth factor NRG-1 controls cell proliferation and interacts with the Hippo-Yap pathway to modulate regeneration. Key components of the extracellular matrix such as Agrin are also crucial for cardiac regeneration. Novel therapies explored in this review, include intramyocardial injection of Agrin or zebrafish-ECM and NRG-1 administration. These therapies may induce regeneration in patients and should be further explored.\nThe heart pumps blood across the body carrying nutrients and oxygen where they are needed. If the heart is damaged\u00a0(e.g., after a heart attack), it may lose its ability to pump blood, and this can lead to heart failure, where the heart cannot meet the body's needs, leaving the affected person tired and breathless. This occurs because the human heart unfortunately has a limited ability to heal and regain function. Current therapies for heart injuries focus on minimizing the problems resulting from the injury but cannot recover damaged heart tissue. Scientists have found that in contrast to adult human hearts, the hearts of baby mice and zebrafish can repair themselves after injuries and recover normal function. This review highlights some important mechanisms that occur in the hearts of baby mice and zebrafish, which may help contribute to their regenerative abilities. These mechanisms involve small messenger chemicals that stimulate heart cells to replicate and reform normal heart tissues.

Parthanatos is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death. Here, we aimed to explore whether DEX protects cardiomyocytes from parthanatos in chronic heart failure (CHF). The levels of malondialdehyde (MAD), total superoxide dismutase (SOD), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured by corresponding detection kits. CHF mice model was established by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). PARP-1 expression in cardiac tissues of wild-type CHF mice was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) on cell death. Masson trichrome staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining were conducted in cardiac tissues to evaluate the histological changes. TUNEL and caspase-1 double-staining and caspase-1 and NLRP3 double-staining were conducted in cardiac tissues to evaluate the effect of DEX on cell death in vivo. The relative expression of parthanatos and NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins was evaluated by western blotting. MNNG induced parthanatos in mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytes. MNNG-induced parthanatos was promoted by ROS production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. DEX treatment suppressed MNNG-induced parthanatos via NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediated by ROS. Importantly, DEX inhibited pathological changes and parthanatos in CHF mice. DEX suppressed the ROS/NLRP3 signaling pathway in CHF mice. DEX inhibited parthanatos in cardiomyocytes and in CHF mice by regulating the ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

{"title": "Effects of ferroptosis in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion model of rat and its association with Sestrin 1.", "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a type of iron-dependent programmed cell death. The inhibition of ferroptosis has been reported to alleviate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). However, it is unknown whether this protective effect occurs in the ischemia or reperfusion phase. Sestrin 1 (Sesn1) possesses remarkable cytoprotective functions to diverse cellular stresses. However, whether Sesn1 is involved in the regulatory process of ferroptosis during myocardial IRI is unknown.\nThis study aimed to simulate an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that occurs in rats within 6 h, verify the occurrence and effects of ferroptosis in the phases of ischemia and reperfusion, and further explore the relationship between ferroptosis, IRI and Sesn1.\nThe hearts of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats undergoing ischemia for varying lengths of time or having undergone ischemia followed by varying lengths of reperfusion were examined. The occurrence of ferroptosis was verified by detecting changes in ferroptosis biomarkers. In addition, ferrstatin-1 (Fer-1) was administered to demonstrate the effect of ferroptosis in myocardial IRI and to detect changes in Sesn1.\nThe results showed that the myocardial damage was more severe with more prolonged myocardial ischemia. There were no significant changes in ferroptosis biomarkers in cardiac tissues during the ischemia phase, the levels of iron and malondialdehyde (MDA) were elevated, and the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) were decreased after myocardial IRI. Compared to the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group, the treatment with Fer-1 before reperfusion can attenuate myocardial IRI, reverse the decrease in GPX4 and FTH1 expression, and decrease the rise in iron content and MDA. In addition, we found that the expression of Sesn1 was reduced in hearts that suffered IRI; however, the treatment with Fer-1 can reverse this situation.\nFerroptosis occurred during the myocardial reperfusion phase but not ischemia.

CAHA2A was constituted with alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose, (hydroxyethyl) methacrylate, and acrylic acid, where CAHA2AP was prepared by interpenetrated CAHA2A with polyvinyl alcohol. Both hydrogels displayed superior physiochemical characteristics, as determined by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy spectral analysis, differential scanning calorimetry\u00a0measurements, tensile testing, contact angle, water profiling, dye release, and conductivity. In vitro degradation of the hydrogels displayed acceptable weight composure and pH changes. Both hydrogels were hemocompatible, and biocompatible as evidenced by direct contact and MTT assays.

{"title": "Intracoronary transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes: Inefficient procedure for cardiac regeneration.", "abstract": "Advances in stem cell biology have facilitated cardiac regeneration, and many animal studies and several initial clinical trials have been conducted using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs). Most preclinical and clinical studies have typically transplanted PSC-CMs via the following two distinct approaches: direct intramyocardial injection or epicardial delivery of engineered heart tissue. Both approaches present common disadvantages, including a mandatory thoracotomy and poor engraftment. Furthermore, a standard transplantation approach has yet to be established. In this study, we tested the feasibility of performing intracoronary administration of PSC-CMs based on a commonly used method of transplanting somatic stem cells. Six male cynomolgus monkeys underwent intracoronary administration of dispersed human PSC-CMs or PSC-CM aggregates, which are called cardiac spheroids, with multiple cell dosages. The recipient animals were sacrificed at 4\u00a0weeks post-transplantation for histological analysis. Intracoronary administration of dispersed human PSC-CMs in the cynomolgus monkeys did not lead to coronary embolism or graft survival. Although the transplanted cardiac spheroids became partially engrafted, they also induced scar formation due to cardiac ischemic injury. Cardiac engraftment and scar formation were reasonably consistent with the spheroid size or cell dosage. These findings indicate that intracoronary transplantation of PSC-CMs is an inefficient therapeutic approach.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2022-11-21", "authors": ["HidekiKobayashi", "ShugoTohyama", "HideakiKanazawa", "HajimeIchimura", "ShujiChino", "YukiTanaka", "YotaSuzuki", "JianZhao", "NaokoShiba", "ShinKadota", "KazumasaNarita", "TakafumiNaito", "TatsuichiroSeto", "KoichiroKuwahara", "YujiShiba", "KeiichiFukuda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.11.004"}

Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment. However, there has always been a shortage of living heart organs. With the development of regenerative medicine, researchers have turned to bioprinting technology that can build tissues and organs in vitro. A large number of relevant literature on three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted hearts were searched and screened in Google Scholar. 3D bioprinting technology can accurately print biomaterials containing living cells into 3D functional living tissues, providing a feasible solution to the shortage of transplantable organs. As one of the most important organs in the human body, the research on 3D bioprinting of the heart has currently become a hot topic. This paper briefly overviews 3D bioprinting technology and the progress in bioprinting cardiac tissue.

{"title": "MiR-144-5p/CCL12 Signaling Axis Modulates Ischemic Preconditioning-Mediated Cardio-protection by Reducing Cell Viability, Enhancing Cell Apoptosis, Fibrosis, and Pyroptosis.", "abstract": "Ischemic postconditioning (IPost) represents short periods of nonlethal ischemia-reperfusion performed at the onset of reperfusion. Studies have shown that IPost involves various biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and pyroptosis and can activate complex signaling pathways. CCL12 is a critical mediator in the inflammatory process after tissue injury. In the present study, we examined the potential actions of CCL12-mediated signaling pathways in cardioprotection after IPost using a cardiomyocyte model. By applying the bioinformatics analysis, we found that CCL12 was upregulated in the rat heart tissues after I/R injury, and the expression level of CCL12 was restored in rats with IPost. The in vitro studies showed that CCL12 and CCR2 expression levels were upregulated in the hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9C2 cells, which was attenuated in the H/R\u2009+\u2009hypoxia post-conditioning (PostC) group. The functional assays showed that H/R treatment reduced cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, and promoted fibrosis and pyroptosis of H9C2 cells, which was attenuated in the H/R\u2009+\u2009PostC group. Overexpression of CCL12 impaired the protective action of hypoxia post-conditioning in the H9C2 cells. Further mechanistic studies showed that miR-144-5p could directly target the 3'\u00a0untranslated region of CCL12. Overexpression of miR-144-5p markedly repressed the expression levels of CCL12 and CCR2 in H9C2 cells, while miR-144-5p inhibition had the opposite effects. Furthermore, the inhibition of miR-144-5p reduced the cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, and enhanced fibrosis and pyroptosis of H9C2 cells after H/R or H/R\u2009+\u2009PostC treatment. In conclusion, CCL12 was downregulated in cardiomyocytes following ischemic postconditioning, and CCL12 overexpression impaired the cardioprotective actions of ischemic postconditioning by reducing cell viability, enhancing cell apoptosis, fibrosis, and pyroptosis. Further mechanistic evidence revealed that CCL12 was a direct target of miR-144-5p, and miR-144-5p/CCL12/CCR2 signaling may represent a critical pathway in mediating the cardioprotective effects of ischemic postconditioning.", "journal": "Applied biochemistry and biotechnology", "date": "2022-11-20", "authors": ["Jun-YuChen", "Huan-JunRuan", "Shi-YuChen", "Xiao-QingWang", "Jun-MinWen", "Zan-XinWang"], "doi": "10.1007/s12010-022-04208-9\n10.1056/NEJMe2000239\n10.3390/ijms21218118\n10.1016/B978-0-12-394309-5.00006-7\n10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118628\n10.1038/s41419-020-2686-7\n10.1038/nm.2507\n10.2174/1871525714666161216100553\n10.1165/rcmb.2005-0239OC\n10.14336/AD.2019.1229\n10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101671\n10.3233/HAB-2007-163-406\n10.3389/fncel.2015.00357\n10.1371/journal.pone.0221111\n10.1038/cddis.2016.223\n10.3892/ijmm.2016.2702\n10.3858/emm.2011.43.8.049\n10.1155/2019/8151836\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314028\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311327\n10.1038/s41590-018-0272-2\n10.1080/21655979.2022.2038448\n10.1016/j.jep.2021.114773\n10.3390/cells8020152\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110419\n10.1113/JP270318\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.044\n10.1371/journal.pone.0075872\n10.1093/cvr/cvy231\n10.1093/cvr/cvs096\n10.1007/s13577-020-00482-z\n10.1080/21655979.2021.2018093\n10.1111/jcmm.16072"}
{"title": "Cellular electrophysiological effects of botulinum toxin A on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and on cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Botulinum toxin A is a well-known neurotransmitter inhibitor with a wide range of applications in modern medicine. Recently, botulinum toxin A preparations have been used in clinical trials to suppress cardiac arrhythmias, especially in the postoperative period. Its antiarrhythmic action is associated with inhibition of the nervous system of the heart, but its direct effect on heart tissue remains unclear. Accordingly, we investigate the effect of botulinum toxin A on isolated cardiac cells and on layers of cardiac cells capable of conducting excitation. Cardiomyocytes of neonatal rat pups and human cardiomyocytes obtained through cell reprogramming were used. A patch-clamp study showed that botulinum toxin A inhibited fast sodium currents and L-type calcium currents in a dose-dependent manner, with no apparent effect on potassium currents. Optical mapping showed that in the presence of botulinum toxin A, the propagation of the excitation wave in the layer of cardiac cells slows down sharply, conduction at high concentrations becomes chaotic, but reentry waves do not form. The combination of botulinum toxin A with a preparation of chitosan showed a stronger inhibitory effect by an order of magnitude. Further, the inhibitory effect of botulinum toxin A is not permanent and disappears after 12\u00a0days of cell culture in a botulinum toxin A-free medium. The main conclusion of the work is that the antiarrhythmic effect of botulinum toxin A found in clinical studies is associated not only with depression of the nervous system but also with a direct effect on heart tissue. Moreover, the combination of botulinum toxin A and chitosan reduces the effective dose of botulinum toxin A.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2022-11-19", "authors": ["AygulNizamieva", "SheidaFrolova", "MihailSlotvitsky", "SandaaraKovalenko", "ValeriyaTsvelaya", "AnnaNikitina", "DavidSergeevichev", "KonstantinAgladze"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-022-02332-1\n10.3390/microorganisms10050886\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.12.004\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.09.001\n10.1016/j.toxicon.2017.08.014\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.275.1.H301\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2021.01.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152018\n10.1152/physrev.00025.2003\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.01.030\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00007\n10.1016/j.tiv.2014.11.010\n10.4070/kcj.2010.40.8.387\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1007/s12012-019-09532-x\n10.1038/s41598-020-64581-5\n10.1248/bpb.b12-00002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1254/jjp.89.249"}

While the pathophysiology of pulmonary COVID-19 manifestation has been substantially unraveled, the underlying pathomechanisms of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are largely unknown. In this multicentre study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of heart samples from 24 autopsies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them to samples of age-matched Influenza H1N1 A (n\u2009=\u200916), lymphocytic non-influenza myocarditis cases (n\u2009=\u20098), and non-inflamed heart tissue (n\u2009=\u20099). We employed conventional histopathology, multiplexed immunohistochemistry (MPX), microvascular corrosion casting, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray phase-contrast tomography using synchrotron radiation, and direct multiplexed measurements of gene expression, to assess morphological and molecular changes holistically. Based on histopathology, none of the COVID-19 samples fulfilled the established diagnostic criteria of viral myocarditis. However, quantification via MPX showed a significant increase in perivascular CD11b/TIE2\u2009+\u2009-macrophages in COVID-19 over time, which was not observed in influenza or non-SARS-CoV-2 viral myocarditis patients. Ultrastructurally, a significant increase in intussusceptive angiogenesis as well as multifocal thrombi, inapparent in conventional morphological analysis, could be demonstrated. In line with this, on a molecular level, COVID-19 hearts displayed a distinct expression pattern of genes primarily coding for factors involved in angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), changes not seen in any of the other patient groups. We conclude that cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is an angiocentric macrophage-driven inflammatory process, distinct from classical anti-viral inflammatory responses, and substantially underappreciated by conventional histopathologic analysis. For the first time, we have observed intussusceptive angiogenesis in cardiac tissue, which we previously identified as the linchpin of vascular remodeling in COVID-19 pneumonia, as a pathognomic sign in affected hearts. Moreover, we identified CD11b\u2009+\u2009/TIE2\u2009+\u2009macrophages as the drivers of intussusceptive angiogenesis and set forward a putative model for the molecular regulation of vascular alterations.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2022-11-14", "authors": ["ChristopherWerlein", "MaximilianAckermann", "HelgeStark", "Harshit RShah", "AlexandarTzankov", "Jasmin DinonneHaslbauer", "Saskiavon Stillfried", "Roman DavidB\u00fclow", "AliEl-Armouche", "StephanKuenzel", "Jan LukasRobertus", "MariusReichardt", "AxelHaverich", "AnneH\u00f6fer", "LaviniaNeubert", "EdithPlucinski", "PeterBraubach", "StijnVerleden", "TimSalditt", "NikolausMarx", "TobiasWelte", "JohannBauersachs", "Hans-HeinrichKreipe", "Steven JMentzer", "PeterBoor", "Stephen MBlack", "FlorianL\u00e4nger", "MarkKuehnel", "DannyJonigk"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-022-09860-7\n10.1038/s41591-020-0968-3\n10.1007/s10456-020-09753-7\n10.1056/NEJMoa2015432\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa623\n10.1007/s10456-021-09789-3\n10.1007/s10456-020-09762-6\n10.1007/s10456-020-09730-0\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa664\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.120.011713\n10.1007/s10554-021-02353-6\n10.3389/fmed.2020.586307\n10.1016/j.cjco.2020.09.016\n10.1136/pgmj.2005.037515\n10.1097/00000542-200412000-00004\n10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107300\n10.1002/ejhf.1828\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050097\n10.1007/s15010-020-01424-5\n10.1016/S0046-8177(87)80363-5\n10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107300\n10.1101/2022.07.02.498430\n10.3389/fcimb.2021.701278\n10.15252/emmm.201505943\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604662\n10.1177/15353702221080130\n10.1161/JAHA.117.007849\n10.7554/eLife.66808\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.982777\n10.1164/rccm.200509-1381OC\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.09.050\n10.1038/s41577-020-0331-4\n10.1183/13993003.00933-2019\n10.1007/s10456-014-9428-3\n10.1007/s12272-009-1801-1\n10.1016/j.mvr.2013.02.002\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.07.009\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa092\n10.1172/jci.insight.151527\n10.1111/jcmm.14269\n10.1016/j.scr.2012.12.006\n10.1172/JCI7615\n10.1007/s10456-009-9147-3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.198929\n10.1152/ajpheart.00343.2011\n10.1007/s00392-015-0871-y"}

Mitochondrial dysfunction occurring during sepsis is a vital contributor to the pathogenesis of myocardial damage. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural poly-phenolic compound, has showed cardio-protective and mitochondrial protective effect. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of RA on sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Adult mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5\u00a0mg/kg) to mimic sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Immediately after LPS challenge, vehicle or RA (100\u2009mg/kg/day) was administrated via gavage. Cardiac function was examined with echocardiographic analyses 12\u2009hours after LPS challenge and cumulative survival of mice was recorded for 8\u2009days. Heart tissues were harvested 12\u2009hours after LPS challenge to perform histological analyses and determine mitochondrial function. We found RA significantly improved cardiac function and survival of LPS-injected mice. Histologically, RA attenuated LPS-mediated cardiomyocyte damage, indicated by decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved myocardial swollen and disarrangement. Moreover, RA attenuated LPS-mediated myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction, indicated by improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), markedly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and alleviated oxidative stress in heart tissues. RA treatment downregulated protein expression of Sirt1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), and Sirt1 inhibition blocked protective effect of RA on LPS-induced myocardial damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, RA attenuates LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction via activating Sirt1/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway to alleviate mitochondrial impairment.

Whether donor exosomes can provide cardioprotection to recipients with chronic heart failure, which confers the highest perioperative risk, is unknown. We examined whether ischaemic preconditioning (IPC)-induced plasma exosomes exerted cardioprotection after their transfer from normal donors to post-infarcted failing hearts.\nPlasma exosomes were obtained from adult rats after IPC or sham. An exosome inhibitor GW4869 was administrated before IPC in an in\u00a0vivo model of ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in normal rats. The IPC exosomes or control exosomes from normal donor rats were perfused to the normal or post-infarcted failing rat hearts before ischaemia in Langendorff perfusion experiments. Infarct size, cardiac enzymes, cardiac function, and pro-survival kinases were quantified.\nThe IPC stimulus increased the release of exosomes, whereas GW4869 inhibited the rise of plasma exosomes. Pre-treatment with GW4869 reversed IPC-mediated cardioprotection against in\u00a0vivo I/R injury. In the Langendorff perfusion experiments, IPC exosomes from normal donor rats reduced mean infarct size from 41.05 (1.87)% to 31.43 (1.81)% and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity in the post-infarcted failing rat hearts. IPC exosomes but not control exosomes activated pro-survival kinases in the heart tissues.\nIschaemic preconditioning-induced exosomes from normal rats can restore cardioprotection in heart failure after myocardial infarction, which is associated with activation of pro-survival protein kinases.

Previous studies have shown that neural component contributes to arterial hypertension etiology, maintenance, and progression and leads to brain damage, peripheral neuropathy, and remodeling of intrinsic cardiac neural plexus. Recently, significant structural changes of the intracardiac neural plexus were demonstrated in young prehypertensive and adult hypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), yet structural alterations of intracardiac neural plexus that occur in the aged SHR remain undetermined. Thus, we analyzed the impact of uncontrolled arterial hypertension in old (48-52\u2009weeks) SHR and the age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Intrinsic cardiac neural plexus was examined using a combination of immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy in cardiac sections and whole-mount preparations. Our findings demonstrate that structural changes of intrinsic cardiac neural plexus caused by arterial hypertension are heterogeneous and may support recent physiological implications about cardiac denervation occurring together with the hyperinnervation of the SHR heart. We conclude that arterial hypertension leads to (i) the decrease of the neuronal body area, the thickness of atrial nerves, the number of myelinated nerve fibers, unmyelinated axon area and cumulative axon area in the nerve, and the density of myocardial nerve fibers, and (ii) the increase in myelinated nerve fiber area and density of neuronal bodies within epicardiac ganglia. Despite neuropathic alterations of myelinated fibers were exposed within intracardiac nerves of both groups, SHR and WKY, we consider that the determined significant changes in structure of intrinsic cardiac neural plexus were predisposed by arterial hypertension.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2022-11-08", "authors": ["NeringaPauziene", "DaliaRanceviene", "KristinaRysevaite-Kyguoliene", "HermanasInokaitis", "IngaSaburkina", "KhrystynaPlekhanova", "DeimanteSabeckiene", "IgnasSabeckis", "RugileMartinaityte", "ErnestaPilnikovaite", "Dainius HPauza"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.25109"}

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are a relatively newly introduced class of antidiabetes drugs which effectively normalize blood glucose via overt glycosuria. Some recent reports suggest that these drugs are able to modulate epicardial adiposity and decrease the risk of cardiac complications in diabetic patients who are at higher risk of epicardial adiposity-dependent cardiac disorders. If proven to be true, these antidiabetic drugs can provide dual benefits as both hypoglycemic agents and as epicardial adiposity normalizing agents, thus providing cardiac benefits.

Different library preparation methods (mRNA poly-A capture vs. rRNA depletion) resulted in similar quality metrics with both library preparations achieving >95% of reads properly aligning to the reference genomes across all PMIs for bovine and human hearts. PMI had no effect on RNA Integrity Number or quantity of RNA recovered at the time points evaluated.

{"title": "RNA-Binding Protein LIN28a Regulates New Myocyte Formation in the Heart Through Long Noncoding RNA-H19.", "abstract": "Developmental cardiac tissue holds remarkable capacity to regenerate after injury and consists of regenerative mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes. On maturation, mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes become binucleated or polyploid and exit the cell cycle. Cardiomyocyte metabolism undergoes a profound shift that coincides with cessation of regeneration in the postnatal heart. However, whether reprogramming metabolism promotes persistence of regenerative mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes enhancing cardiac function and repair after injury is unknown. Here, we identify a novel role for RNA-binding protein LIN28a, a master regulator of cellular metabolism in cardiac repair after injury.\nLIN28a overexpression was tested using mouse transgenesis on postnatal cardiomyocyte numbers, cell cycle, and response to apical resection injury. With the use of neonatal and adult cell culture systems and adult and Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers myocardial injury models in mice, the effect of LIN28a overexpression on cardiomyocyte cell cycle and metabolism was tested. Last, isolated adult cardiomyocytes from LIN28a and wild-type mice 4 days after myocardial injury were used for RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing.\nLIN28a was found to be active primarily during cardiac development and rapidly decreases after birth. LIN28a reintroduction at postnatal day (P) 1, P3, P5, and P7 decreased maturation-associated polyploidization, nucleation, and cell size, enhancing cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in LIN28a transgenic pups compared with wild-type littermates. Moreover, LIN28a overexpression extended cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity beyond P7 concurrent with increased cardiac function 30 days after apical resection. In the adult heart, LIN28a overexpression attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, enhanced cell cycle activity, cardiac function, and survival in mice 12 weeks after myocardial infarction compared with wild-type littermate controls. Instead, LIN28a small molecule inhibitor attenuated the proreparative effects of LIN28a on the heart. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing LIN28a mechanistically showed increased glycolysis, ATP production, and levels of metabolic enzymes compared with control. LIN28a immunoprecipitation followed by RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing in cardiomyocytes isolated from LIN28a-overexpressing hearts after injury identified long noncoding RNA-H19 as its most significantly altered target. Ablation of long noncoding RNA-H19 blunted LIN28a-induced enhancement on cardiomyocyte metabolism and cell cycle activity.\nCollectively, LIN28a reprograms cardiomyocyte metabolism and promotes persistence of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes in the injured heart, enhancing proreparative processes, thereby linking cardiomyocyte metabolism to regulation of ploidy/nucleation and repair in the heart.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2022-11-01", "authors": ["Vagner Oliveira CarvalhoRigaud", "Robert CHoy", "JustinKurian", "ClareZarka", "MichaelBehanan", "IsabellaBrosious", "JenniferPennise", "TejPatel", "TaoWang", "JaslynJohnson", "Lindsay MKraus", "SadiaMohsin", "Steven RHouser", "MohsinKhan"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059346\n10.1038/s41598-017-15656-3\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.032\n10.1126/science.aar2038\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043067\n10.15252/embr.201949752\n10.7554/eLife.50163\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.12.017\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0163\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.5.H2183\n10.1073/pnas.1214608110\n10.1038/ng.3929\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1161/01.RES.0000259560.39234.99\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314223\n10.1002/stem.591\n10.1126/science.1154040\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.059\n10.1021/acschembio.6b00232\n10.1186/s12943-017-0699-3\n10.1038/onc.2017.368\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.014\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.102162\n10.1126/science.6494891\n10.1038/ng.593\n10.7150/thno.47354\n10.7554/eLife.53071\n10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4\n10.3389/fcell.2021.645276\n10.3390/cells9051144\n10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.11.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.033\n10.15252/embr.201949752\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa519"}

As a member of the Rab family, Rab10 has multiple subcellular localizations and carries out a wide variety of functions. Here, we explored the role of Rab10 on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiac-specific Rab10 transgenic mice were constructed and treated with DOX or saline. We found that cardiac-specific overexpression of Rab10 alleviated cardiac dysfunction and attenuated cytoplasmic vacuolization and mitochondrial damage in DOX-treated mouse heart tissues. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis showed that Rab10 alleviated DOX-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes in mouse heart tissues. We demonstrated that DOX mediated apoptosis, oxidative stress and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential in H9c2 cells, while overexpression and knockdown of Rab10 attenuated and aggravated these effects, respectively. Furthermore, we found that Mst1, a serine-threonine kinase, was cleaved and translocated into the nucleus in H9c2 cells after DOX treatment, and knockdown of Mst1 alleviated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Overexpression of Rab10 inhibited the cleavage of Mst1 mediated by DOX treatment in vivo and in vitro. Together, our findings demonstrated that cardiac-specific overexpression of Rab10 alleviated DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction and injury via inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, which may be partially ascribed to the inhibition of Mst1 activity.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2022-10-30", "authors": ["ChenZhang", "QinghuaDan", "SongLai", "YutongZhang", "ErerGao", "HaiyanLuo", "LipingYang", "XiaoboGao", "CailingLu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2022.10.005"}

In group 2, spirulina was administered orally to rats. In group 3, rats were irradiated to the chest region with 15 Gray(Gy) x-radiation. In groups 4 and 5, rats were irradiated in the same way as group 3. Forty-eight hours after irradiation, treatment with Spirulina and Metformin began. All rats were sacrificed after ten weeks, and their heart tissues were removed for histopathological and biochemical assays.\nResults showed an elevation in Malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Moreover, pathological changes of radiation were irregularities in the arrangement of myofibrils, proliferation, migration of mononuclear cells, vacuolation of the cytoplasm, and congestion. Administration of spirulina enhanced the SOD activity while did not affect MDA level and pathological change in heart tissue. Despite spirulina, metformin had a considerable effect on pathological lesions and decreased the level of MDA.\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) may be involved in the late effects of radiationinduced heart injury, and scavenging these particles may contribute to reduced radiation side effects.

This deformation can cause a variety of soft and hard tissue injuries. Finite element modeling (FEM) represents one of the best tools to predict injuries from this high-rate compression mechanism. However, the validity of a model is reliant on accurate material properties for biological tissues. In this study, we measured the stress-strain response of thoraco-abdominal tissue during high-rate compression (1000 and 1900 s-1) using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). High-rate material properties of porcine adipose, heart, spleen, and stomach tissue were characterized. At a strain rate of 1000\u2009s-1, adipose (E\u2009=\u20094.7\u2009MPa) had the most compliant stress-strain response, followed by spleen (E\u2009=\u20099.6\u2009MPa), and then heart tissue (E\u2009=\u200913.6\u2009MPa). At a strain rate of 1900 s-1, adipose (E\u2009=\u20097.3\u2009MPa) had the most compliant stress-strain response, followed by spleen (E\u2009=\u200910.7\u2009MPa), heart (E\u2009=\u200914.1\u2009MPa), and stomach (E\u2009=\u200932.6\u2009MPa) tissue. Only adipose tissue demonstrated a consistent rate dependence for these high strain rates, with a stiffer response at 1900 s-1 compared to 1000\u2009s-1.

Phenotypic assays characterized the consequences of either apelin receptor knockdown before hESC-CM differentiation (early knockdown) or in 3D engineered heart tissues as a disease model (late knockdown). hESC-CMs expressed the apelin signalling system at a similar level to the adult heart. Early apelin receptor knockdown decreased cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency and prolonged voltage sensing, associated with asynchronous contraction. Late apelin receptor knockdown had detrimental consequences on 3D engineered heart tissue contractile properties, decreasing contractility and increasing stiffness.\nWe have successfully knocked down the apelin receptor, using an inducible system, to demonstrate a key role in hESC-CM differentiation.

The goal of this study was to determine scopoletin's therapeutic potential in an animal model of myocardial infarction induced with ISO. There were five groups of albino male rats. Group I (control) animals were orally treated with olive oil. Group II (scopoletin) animals were pre-treated orally with a 50-mg dosage of scopoletin for 28 days. Group III (ISO-treated) animals were treated with 85\u00a0mg/kg of ISO subcutaneously for 2 consecutive days (29th and 30th day). Group IV (scopoletin and ISO) animals were pre-treated orally with 25\u00a0mg of scopoletin for 28 days before exposure to ISO. Group V (scopoletin and ISO) animals were pre-treated with 50\u00a0mg of scopoletin for 28 days before exposure to ISO. In the ISO-administered animals, a wider heart-to-body weight ratio, a higher heart weight, higher cardiac diagnostic markers, higher MDA levels and related antioxidant levels, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers were observed. Scopoletin pre-treatment with ISO (25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg b.wt) significantly reduced heart-to-body weight ratio, cardiac diagnostic markers, MDA, inflammatory markers, and apoptotic markers. Meantime, a pre-treatment with scopoletin increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes. Inflammation and necrosis were observed in the histopathology of heart tissue of ISO-treated animals and these histopathological conditions were reversed by scopoletin pretreatment.

{"title": "A Conductive Bioengineered Cardiac Patch for Myocardial Infarction Treatment by Improving Tissue Electrical Integrity.", "abstract": "Conductive scaffolds are of great value for constructing functional myocardial tissues and promoting tissue reconstruction in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). Here, a novel scaffold composed of silk fibroin and polypyrrole (SP50) with a typical sponge-like porous structure and electrical conductivity similar to the native myocardium is developed. An electroactive engineered cardiac patch (SP50 ECP) with a certain thickness is constructed by applying electrical stimulation (ES) to the cardiomyocytes (CMs) on the scaffold. SP50 ECP can significantly express cardiac marker protein (\u03b1-actinin, Cx-43, and cTnT) and has better contractility and electrical coupling performance. Following in vivo transplantation, SP50 ECP shows a notable therapeutic effect in repairing infarcted myocardium. Not only can SP50 ECP effectively improves left ventricular remodeling and restore cardiac functions, such as ejection function (EF), but more importantly, improves the propagation of electrical pulses and promote the synchronous contraction of CMs in the scar area with normal myocardium, effectively reducing the susceptibility of MI rats to arrhythmias. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a facile approach to constructing electroactive ECPs based on porous conductive scaffolds and proves the therapeutic effects of ECPs in repairing the infarcted heart, which may represent a promising strategy for MI treatment.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2022-10-14", "authors": ["QiYin", "PingZhu", "WeiLiu", "ZhongbaoGao", "LumingZhao", "ChunlanWang", "SiweiLi", "MiaomiaoZhu", "QiZhang", "XiaoZhang", "ChangyongWang", "JinZhou"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202201856"}
{"title": "Treatment of cardiac fibrosis: from neuro-hormonal inhibitors to CAR-T cell therapy.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the spaces between cardiomyocytes following both acute and chronic tissue damage events, resulting in the remodeling and stiffening of heart tissue. Fibrosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular disorders, including heart failure and myocardial infarction. Several studies have identified fibroblasts, which are induced to differentiate into myofibroblasts in response to various types of damage, as the most important cell types involved in the fibrotic process. Some drugs, such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiac fibrosis. There are currently no drugs with primarily anti-fibrotic action approved for clinical use, as well as the evidence of a clinical efficacy of these drugs is extremely limited, despite the numerous encouraging results from experimental studies. A new approach is represented by the use of CAR-T cells engineered in vivo using lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA coding for a receptor directed against the FAP protein, expressed by cardiac myofibroblasts.

Berberine (BBR) is a monomer compound with various biological functions. And some studies have confirmed that BBR plays an important role in alleviating cardiomyocyte injury after MI. However, the specific mechanism is unclear. In this study, we induced a model of MI by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and we surprisingly found that BBR significantly improved ventricular remodeling, with a minor inflammatory and oxidative stress injury, and stronger angiogenesis. Moreover, BBR inhibited the secretion of Wnt5a/\u03b2-catenin pathway in macrophages after MI, thus promoting the differentiation of macrophages into M2 type. In summary, BBR effectively improved cardiac function of mice after MI, and the potential protective mechanism was associated with the regulation of inflammatory responses and the inhibition of macrophage Wnt5a/\u03b2-catenin pathway in the infarcted heart tissues.

The study of ECC regulation has primarily been limited to cardiomyocytes (CMs), which conduct voltage waves via calcium fluxes from one cell to another, eliciting contraction of the atria followed by the ventricles. CMs rapidly transmit ionic flux via gap junction proteins, predominantly connexin 43. While the expression of connexin isoforms has been identified in each of the individual cell populations comprising the heart, the formation of gap junctions with nonmuscle cells (i.e., macrophages and Schwann cells) has gained new attention. Evaluating nonmuscle contributions to ECC in vivo or in situ remains difficult and necessitates the development of simple, yet biomimetic in vitro models to better understand and prevent physiological dysfunction. Standard 2D cell culture often consists of homogenous cell populations and lacks the dynamic mechanical environment of native tissue, confounding the phenotypic and proteomic makeup of these highly mechanosensitive cell populations in prolonged culture conditions.

Scale-up suspension culture, use of engineered tissues to support stem cell differentiation, and CM production for improved control over cellular microenvironment in the suspension system need nondestructive methods to track engineered tissue development. The ability to couple images that capture experimenter perceived \"good\" or \"bad\" batches based on visualization at early differentiation time points with actual experimental outcomes in an unbiased way is a step toward building these methods. In recent years, ML techniques have been successfully applied to identify critical process parameters and use this information to build models that describe process outcomes in cell production and hiPSC differentiation. Building upon these successes, here, we utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build a binary classifier model for CM content on differentiation day 10 (dd10) for hiPSC-CMs. We consider two separate data sets as potential input features for the classification models.

The Lupeol (100\u2009mg/kg, p.o.), Naringin (100\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) and its combination (100\u2009mg/kg each) treated group significantly improved physical infarct size, biochemical (Nitrite, SOD, CAT, and GSH) and histological (heart tissue- mitochondrial function/integrity and fibrosis) alterations occurs due to BDL-ligation. This study was concluded that oral administration of Lupeol, Naringin, and its combination has a curative potential against BDL-induced cardiac injury in rats by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions, resulting in reduced heart necrosis/myocardial infarction and increased myocardial activity. It also inhibits cardiac damage in the rat heart, these effects may be linked to the NO level (eNOS) is increased and the inactivation of the NF-kB-p65 expression pathways.This study also provides new insights into the development of lupeol and Naringin combination that can be used as supportive therapy for cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Drug research", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["FirojAlam", "Anil KumarKharya", "Ritesh KumarSrivastav", "JuberAkhtar", "Mohammad IrfanKhan", "MohammadAhmad"], "doi": "10.1055/a-1879-2944"}

Potassium oxonate suppresses uric acid degradation to increase extracellular concentration, while hypoxanthine is the catalytic substrate of XO. We aimed to observe cardiac damage in a chronic HUA mouse model induced by potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine. The mouse model was established by the co-administration of potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine for eight\u2009weeks. Then, left ventricular parameters were examined by echocardiographic evaluation, and the heart tissues were harvested for further histopathological analysis. The results showed that plasma uric acid was persistently elevated in the model mice, which demonstrated the stable establishment of chronic HUA. The left ventricular anterior wall was significantly thickened in the model group compared with the blank control group. After the end of modeling, the left ventricular anterior wall thickness of the hyperuricemic mice increased compared with that of blank group. The histological analysis showed and myocardial structure disorganization in the model group compared with the blank control. The above cardiac impairment changes could be attenuated by allopurinol pretreatment. This study systematically assessed cardiac damage in a chronic HUA mouse model.

{"title": "The End-to-End Molecular Communication Model of Extracellular Vesicle-Based Drug Delivery.", "abstract": "A closer look at nature has recently brought more interest in exploring and utilizing intra-body communication networks composed of cells as intrinsic, perfectly biocompatible infrastructures to deliver therapeutics. Naturally occurring cell-to-cell communication systems are being manipulated to release, navigate, and take-up soluble cell-derived messengers that are either therapeutic by nature or carry therapeutic molecular cargo. One example of such structures is extracellular vesicles (EVs) which have been recently proven to have pharmacokinetic properties, opening new avenues for developing the next generation biotherapeutics. In this paper, we study theoretical aspects of the EV transfer within heart tissue as a case study by utilizing an information and communication technology-like approach in analyzing molecular communication systems. Our modeling implies the abstraction of the EV releasing cells as transmitters, the extracellular matrix as the channel, and the EV receiving cells as receivers. Our results, derived from the developed analytical models, indicate that the release can be modulated using external forces such as electrical signals, and the transfer and reception can be affected by the extracellular matrix and plasma membrane properties, respectively.The presented modeling provides initial results for the EV biodistributions and contribute to avoiding unplanned administration, often resulting in side- and adverse effects.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on nanobioscience", "date": "2022-09-16", "authors": ["HamidKhoshfekr Rudsari", "MohammadZoofaghari", "MladenVeletic", "JacobBergsland", "IlangkoBalasingham"], "doi": "10.1109/TNB.2022.3206908"}

In comparison with the 2009 pandemic (pH1N1), SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to lead to more severe disease, with multi-organ effects, including cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with acute and long-term cardiovascular disease, but the molecular changes that govern this remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the host transcriptome landscape of cardiac tissues collected at rapid autopsy from seven SARS-CoV-2, two pH1N1, and six control patients using targeted spatial transcriptomics approaches. Although SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in cardiac tissue, host transcriptomics showed upregulation of genes associated with DNA damage and repair, heat shock, and M1-like macrophage infiltration in the cardiac tissues of COVID-19 patients. The DNA damage present in the SARS-CoV-2 patient samples, were further confirmed by \u03b3-H2Ax immunohistochemistry. In comparison, pH1N1 showed upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, in particular interferon and complement pathways, when compared with COVID-19 patients. These data demonstrate the emergence of distinct transcriptomic profiles in cardiac tissues of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza infection supporting the need for a greater understanding of the effects on extra-pulmonary organs, including the cardiovascular system of COVID-19 patients, to delineate the immunopathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and long term impact on health.", "journal": "Immunology", "date": "2022-09-16", "authors": ["AruthaKulasinghe", "NingLiu", "Chin WeeTan", "JamesMonkman", "Jane ESinclair", "Dharmesh DBhuva", "DavidGodbolt", "LiuliuPan", "AndyNam", "HabibSadeghirad", "KeiSato", "Gianluigi LiBassi", "KenO'Byrne", "CamilaHartmann", "Anna Flavia RibeiroDos Santos Miggiolaro", "Gustavo LenciMarques", "Lidia ZytynskiMoura", "DerekRichard", "MarkAdams", "Luciade Noronha", "Cristina PellegrinoBaena", "Jacky YSuen", "RakeshArora", "Gabrielle TBelz", "Kirsty RShort", "Melissa JDavis", "Fernando Souza-FonsecaGuimaraes", "John FFraser"], "doi": "10.1111/imm.13577"}

ILK overexpression or TRPV4 agonist promoted the angiogenesis in HUVEC co-cultured with CACs. ILK overexpression or activation upregulated TRPV4 expression in CACs, while TRPV4 agonist stimulation also regulated ILK expression. TRPV4 agonist effectively improved the myocardial function of AMI rats. Moreover, this effect could be strengthened when combined with CAC transplantation, as CAC transplantation dramatically upregulated the expression of ILK and TRPV4 in heart tissues of AMI rats.

We evaluated the in vivo efficacy of mTOR inhibition and found that the therapeutic administration of rapamycin reduced vascular fibrosis and intimal hyperplasia of the coronary arteries in CAWS-injected mice. Furthermore, the analysis of cardiac tissue from KD fatalities revealed that vascular fibroblasts localizing with inflamed coronary arteries up-regulate mTOR signaling, confirming that the mTOR pathway is active in human KD.\nOur findings demonstrate that mTOR signaling contributes to coronary artery remodeling in KD, and that targeting this pathway offers a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or restrict this pathology in high-risk KD patients.", "journal": "Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)", "date": "2022-09-04", "authors": ["Angus TStock", "SarahParsons", "Damian BD'Silva", "Jacinta AHansen", "Varun JSharma", "FionaJames", "GrahamStarkey", "RohitD'Costa", "Claire LGordon", "Ian PWicks"], "doi": "10.1002/art.42340"}
{"title": "Therapeutic Role of Phytophenol Gallic Acid for the Cure of COVID-19 Pathogenesis.", "abstract": "The SARS CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19 uses the ACE-2 receptor of the host to penetrate and infect the cell, mainly in the pulmonary, renal, and cardiac tissues. The earlier reported Delta and the recent Omicron are the variants of concern. The mutations in the RBD region of spike protein are associated with increased RBD-ACE-2 receptor interaction. This binding affinity between spike protein and the receptor is greater in Omicron than in the Delta variant. Moreover, the Omicron variant has numerous hydrophobic amino acids in the RBD region of the spike protein, which maintain its structural integrity. Gallic acid is a phytophenol and shows high binding affinity toward the ACE-2 receptors, which may be helpful for better outcomes in the treatment of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

{"title": "Irisin Regulates Cardiac Responses to Exercise in Health and Diseases: a Narrative Review.", "abstract": "Exercise has been recognized as an important non-pharmacological approach for the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanisms of exercise in promoting cardiovascular health remain unclear. Exercise generates cardiac benefits via stimulating muscle to secret hundreds of myokines that directly enter circulation and target heart tissue. Therefore, inter-organ communication between skeletal muscle and heart may be one important regulating pattern, and such communication can occur through secretion of molecules, frequently known as myokines. Irisin, a newly identified myokine, is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) and secreted by the stimulation of exercise. Recently, accumulating evidence focusing on the interaction between irisin and cardiac function has been reported. This review highlights the molecular signaling by which irisin regulates the benefits of exercise on cardiac function both in physiological and pathological process, and discusses the clinical potential of irisin in treating heart diseases. Exercise generates various cardiovascular benefits through stimulating skeletal muscle to secrete irisin. The exercise \"hormone\" irisin, both produced by exercise or recombinant form, exerts therapeutic effects in a group of cardiovascular disorders including heart failure, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis and hypertension. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain ambiguous.This review highlights the most up-to-date findings to bridge the gap between exercise, irisin and cardiovascular diseases, and discusses the potential clinical prospect of irisin.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2022-08-30", "authors": ["BaishuZhu", "BinWang", "ChenZhao", "YuanxinWang", "YalanZhou", "JunjieLin", "RenqingZhao"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-022-10310-4\n10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02144-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9\n10.1177/2050312119860401\n10.1016/S0735-1097(85)80165-0\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehz859\n10.1097/00005768-200106001-00007\n10.1001/jama.281.4.327\n10.1001/jama.1996.03540030039029\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60749-6\n10.1002/dvdy.10099\n10.1016/S0378-1119(02)00828-4\n10.1038/nature10777\n10.1016/j.metabol.2012.09.002\n10.1155/2020/1949415\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.08.001\n10.1016/j.numecd.2019.09.025\n10.1111/febs.12619\n10.1186/s12986-018-0298-3\n10.1016/j.metabol.2015.05.010\n10.1016/j.diabres.2013.01.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094235\n10.1111/cen.12658\n10.1002/cbin.11441\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.077\n10.3399/bjgp10X502137\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000350\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs215\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61340-X\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.02.050\n10.1080/10520295.2017.1303194\n10.1371/journal.pone.0181461\n10.1002/jcp.27037\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2014.04.025\n10.1016/j.metabol.2017.05.002\n10.1111/jcmm.15180\n10.18632/aging.102899\n10.1038/s41401-019-0230-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166182\n10.1016/S0005-2728(98)00120-0\n10.1089/ars.2010.3363\n10.1074/jbc.M702294200\n10.1111/jcmm.15127\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.265819\n10.1080/15548627.2019.1591672\n10.1111/bph.12516\n10.1113/JP271301\n10.1083/jcb.200809125\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.017\n10.1002/ctm2.166\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31071-1\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.07.250\n10.1042/CS20190016\n10.1016/j.cbi.2019.01.031\n10.1152/ajpheart.00554.2011\n10.1007/s11010-008-9803-8\n10.1152/ajpcell.2001.280.1.C53\n10.1038/nm1574\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.01.001\n10.1007/s11897-012-0102-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311147\n10.1201/9781315151311\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.637793\n10.1001/jama.2009.1063\n10.1002/path.1711710311\n10.1172/JCI116670\n10.1371/journal.pone.0158038\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.10.020\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004031\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32225-6\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00240.x\n10.1016/j.tips.2008.05.003\n10.1111/j.1524-6175.2006.06032.x\n10.1002/j.1932-8737.1997.tb00009.x\n10.1139/apnm-2019-0602\n10.1161/JAHA.116.003433\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0706639\n10.1016/S0272-6386(96)90519-3\n10.1038/srep22780\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.09767\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.160\n10.1007/s10557-015-6580-y\n10.1093/cvr/cvy023\n10.1590/S0100-879X1997000300004\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.040\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.155663\n10.1097/01.psy.0000116719.95524.e2\n10.1038/ajh.2010.154\n10.1016/0006-8993(92)90282-E\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.1998.tb02235.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvp160\n10.1007/s12012-012-9184-9\n10.1016/j.taap.2020.114953\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.002\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1560\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.010908.163111\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136816\n10.1186/s13287-020-01746-z\n10.1109/RBME.2015.2431681\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2019.05.009\n10.1515/jbcpp-2018-0090\n10.1152/ajpheart.00443.2015\n10.2337/diacare.26.10.2947\n10.1038/nutd.2017.3\n10.1185/030079903125003008\n10.1038/nutd.2014.7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.013\n10.1007/s11883-017-0678-6\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000608\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.06.038\n10.26402/jpp.2018.1.13\n10.1620/tjem.233.135\n10.7717/peerj.3669\n10.1016/S0899-9007(96)00000-8\n10.1093/cvr/cvq076\n10.1007/s10753-017-0685-3\n10.4161/adip.26082\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.025"}

Likewise, conductive polymers (CP) appear promising electroactive biomaterial for proliferation of cells. Herein, we have investigated CNT blends with two different conductive polymers, polypyrrole/CNT (PPy/CNT) and PEDOT/CNT to evaluate the growth, survival, and beating behavior of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM). The combination of CP/CNT not only shows excellent biocompatibility on NRVM, after 2\u00a0weeks of culture, but also exerts functional effects on networks of cardiomyocytes. NRVMs cultured on CNT-based substrates exhibited improved cellular function, i.e., homogeneous, non-arrhythmogenic, and more frequent spontaneous beating; particularly PEDOT/CNT substrates, which yielded to higher beating amplitudes, thus suggesting a more mature cardiac phenotype. Furthermore, cells presented enhanced structure: aligned sarcomeres, organized and abundant Connexin 43 (Cx43). Finally, no signs of induced hypertrophy were observed. In conclusion, the combination of CNT with CP produces high viability and promotes cardiac functionality, suggesting great potential to generate scaffolding supports for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Cell biology and toxicology", "date": "2022-08-28", "authors": ["NuriaAlegret", "AntonioDominguez-Alfaro", "DavidMecerreyes", "MaurizioPrato", "LuisaMestroni", "BrisaPe\u00f1a"], "doi": "10.1007/s10565-022-09753-x\n10.1021/acsami.8b16462\n10.1002/jbm.a.36894\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00239\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300282\n10.1016/j.polymer.2022.124952\n10.1021/acsapm.1c01929\n10.1021/acscentsci.1c00712\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b01316\n10.1021/acsami.0c16645\n10.1002/marc.202100100\n10.1038/nnano.2010.246\n10.1021/cn300048q\n10.1371/journal.pone.0073621\n10.1039/C9LC00636B\n10.1039/c2jm32165c\n10.1038/s41569-019-0331-x\n10.1038/s41427-018-0014-9\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.010\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121008\n10.1021/nl802855c\n10.1126/science.aan1227\n10.1021/nn4002193\n10.1021/nl204064s\n10.1126/sciadv.1601007\n10.1016/j.nano.2017.01.020\n10.1021/acsabm.1c00133\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.005\n10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01734\n10.1021/acsami.7b11438\n10.1038/nmat2441\n10.1002/adfm.201803951\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.007\n10.1038/nrn1827\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209809\n10.1021/acsmaterialslett.1c00146\n10.1021/acsami.1c04631\n10.1021/acsami.9b21066"}

Then, an aqueous biocompatible hydrazided hyaluronic acid (HHA) solution encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is impregnated into the anchored carpet to form HHA@ODS@HP-\u03b2-CD@Res hydrogel in situ via click reaction, thus prolonging the in vivo retention time of therapeutic drug and cells. Importantly, the HHA added to outer surface consumes the remaining aldehydes to contribute to nonsticky top surface, avoiding adhesion to other tissues.

The inextricable link between structure and function suggests that hydrogel composites hold tremendous promise as a biomaterial-guided strategy to advance heart muscle tissue engineering. Such composites provide biophysical cues and functionality as a provisional extracellular matrix that hydrogels cannot on their own.

{"title": "Involvement of TRPM2 Channel on Doxorubicin-Induced Experimental Cardiotoxicity Model: Protective Role of Selenium.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOXR) is an important chemotherapeutic drug used in cancer treatment for many years. Several studies reported that the use of DOXR increased toxicity by causing an increase in oxidative stress (OS), especially in the heart. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of selenium (Se) and the role of transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) channel activation by using N-(p-amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA) in a model of DOXR-induced cardiotoxicity. Sixty female rats were equally divided into the control, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DOXR, DOXR\u2009+\u2009Se, DOXR\u2009+\u2009ACA, and DOXR\u2009+\u2009Se\u2009+\u2009ACA groups.

In addition, histopathological examination was performed in cardiac tissues and TNF-\u03b1, caspase 3, and TRPM2 channel expression levels were determined immunohistochemically. The levels of GSH, GSH-Px, caspases 3 and 9, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, ROS, PARP-1, and TRPM2 channel in serum, and cardiac tissue in the DOXR group were higher than in the control and DMSO groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, these parameters in Se and/or ACA treatment groups were lower than in the DOXR group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Also, we determined that Se and/or ACA treatment together with DOXR application decreased the TNF-\u03b1, Cas-3, and TRPM2 channel expression levels in the cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Nicorandil Suppresses Ischemia-Induced Norepinephrine Release and Ventricular Arrhythmias in Hypertrophic Hearts.", "abstract": "Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are a common cause of sudden death in acute myocardial infarction (MI), for which hypertension is a major risk factor. Nicorandil opens ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, which are expressed by nerve terminals and cardiomyocytes and regulate the release of norepinephrine (NE). However, the effects of nicorandil on ischemic NE release in cardiac tissue remain unclear. Therefore, we herein investigated whether nicorandil suppressed interstitial NE concentrations and VAs during acute MI in pressure overload-induced hypertrophic hearts.\nRats were divided into two groups: an abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) group and sham-operated (Sham) group. Four weeks after constriction, cardiac geometry and functions were examined using echocardiography and hemodynamic analyses. Myocardial ischemia was induced by coronary artery occlusion for 100\u00a0min with or without the administration of nicorandil. VAs were assessed by electrocardiography, and NE concentrations in the ischemic region were measured using a micro-dialysis method.\nAAC induced left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction. VAs markedly increased in the early phase (0-20\u00a0min) of ischemia in both groups and were more frequent in the AAC group.

{"title": "Ferulic acid mitigates diabetic cardiomyopathy via modulation of metabolic abnormalities in cardiac tissues of diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular abnormalities have been reported as a major contributor of diabetic mortality. The protective effect of ferulic acid on diabetic cardiomyopathy in fructose-streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) rat model was elucidated in this study. Type 2 diabetic rats were treated by oral administration of low (150\u2009mg/kg b.w) and high (300\u2009mg/kg b.w) doses of ferulic acid. Metformin was used as the antidiabetic drug. Rats were humanely euthanized after 5\u00a0weeks of treatment, and their blood and hearts were collected. Induction of T2D depleted the levels of reduced glutathione, glycogen, and HDL-cholesterol and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ENTPDase, and 5'nucleotidase. It simultaneously triggered increase in the levels of malondialdehyde, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, creatinine kinase-MB as well as activities of acetylcholinesterase, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ATPase, glucose-6-phopsphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphophatase, glycogen phosphorylase, and lipase. T2D induction further revealed an obvious degeneration of cardiac muscle morphology. However, treatment with ferulic acid markedly reversed the levels and activities of these biomarkers with concomitant improvement in myocardium structural morphology, which had favorable comparison with the standard drug, metformin. Additionally, T2D induction led to the depletion of 40%, 75%, and 33% of fatty acids, fatty esters, and steroids, respectively, with concomitant generation of eicosenoic acid, gamolenic acid, and vitamin E. Ferulic acid treatment restored eicosanoic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl ester, with concomitant generation of 6-octadecenoic acid, (Z)-, cis-11-eicosenoic acid, tridecanedioic acid, octadecanoic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl ester, ethyl 3-hydroxytridecanoate, dipalmitin, cholesterol isocaproate, cholest-5-ene, 3-(1-oxobuthoxy)-, cholesta-3,5-diene.

{"title": "Nogo-A reduces ceramide de novo biosynthesis to protect from heart failure.", "abstract": "Growing evidence correlate the accrual of the sphingolipid ceramide in plasma and cardiac tissue with heart failure (HF). Regulation of sphingolipid metabolism in the heart and the pathological impact of its derangement remain poorly understood. Recently, we discovered that Nogo-B, a membrane protein of endoplasmic reticulum, abundant in the vascular wall, down-regulates the sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis via serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), first and rate liming enzyme, to impact vascular functions and blood pressure. Nogo-A, a splice isoform of Nogo, is transiently expressed in cardiomyocyte (CM) following pressure overload. Cardiac Nogo is up-regulated in dilated and ischaemic cardiomyopathies in animals and humans. However, its biological function in the heart remains unknown.\nWe discovered that Nogo-A is a negative regulator of SPT activity and refrains ceramide de novo biosynthesis in CM exposed to haemodynamic stress, hence limiting ceramide accrual. At 7 days following transverse aortic constriction (TAC), SPT activity was significantly up-regulated in CM lacking Nogo-A and correlated with ceramide accrual, particularly very long-chain ceramides, which are the most abundant in CM, resulting in the suppression of 'beneficial' autophagy. At 3 months post-TAC, mice lacking Nogo-A in CM showed worse pathological cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, with ca. 50% mortality rate.\nMechanistically, Nogo-A refrains ceramides from accrual, therefore preserves the 'beneficial' autophagy, mitochondrial function, and metabolic gene expression, limiting the progression to HF under sustained stress.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2022-07-12", "authors": ["LindaSasset", "Onorina LauraManzo", "YiZhang", "AliceMarino", "LuisaRubinelli", "Maria AntoniettaRiemma", "Madhavi Latha SChalasani", "Dragos CDasoveanu", "FiorentinaRoviezzo", "Stanislovas SJankauskas", "GaetanoSantulli", "Maria RosariaBucci", "Theresa TLu", "AnnaritaDi Lorenzo"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvac108"}

However, the function of SIRT6 in the process of cardiac pathogenesis caused by obesity-associated lipotoxicity remains to be unveiled. This study was designed to elucidate the role of SIRT6 in the pathogenesis of cardiac injury due to nutrition overload-induced obesity and explore the downstream signaling pathways affecting oxidative stress in the heart. In this study, we used Sirt6 cardiac-specific knockout murine models treated with a high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to explore the function and mechanism of SIRT6 in the heart tissue during HFD-induced obesity. We also took advantage of neonatal cardiomyocytes to study the role and downstream molecules of SIRT6 during HFD-induced injury in vitro, in which intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial content were assessed. We observed that during HFD-induced obesity, Sirt6 loss-of-function aggravated cardiac injury including left ventricular hypertrophy and lipid accumulation. Our results evidenced that upon increased fatty acid uptake, SIRT6 positively regulated the expression of endonuclease G (ENDOG), which is a mitochondrial-resident molecule that plays an\u00a0important role in mitochondrial biogenesis and redox homeostasis. Our results also showed that SIRT6 positively regulated superoxide dismutase 2\u00a0(SOD2) expression post-transcriptionally via ENDOG.

As a traditional Chinese medicine derivative with Schisandra chinensis as raw material, bicyclol is well known for its significant anti-inflammatory effect. Chronic inflammation plays a significant part in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. Our purpose was to explore the effect and mechanism of bicyclol on obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.\nMice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and cardiomyocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) were used as models of obesity-related cardiomyopathy in vivo and in vitro, respectively. The therapeutic effect of bicyclol on pathological changes such as myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis was evaluated by staining cardiac tissue sections. PCR was used to detect inflammatory factors in H9c2 cells and animal heart tissue after bicyclol treatment. Then, we used western blotting to detect the expression levels of the myocardial hypertrophy related protein, myocardial fibrosis related protein, NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways.\nOur results indicated that bicyclol treatment significantly alleviates HFD-induced myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways. Similar to animal level results, bicyclol could significantly inhibit PA-induced inflammation and prevent NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways from being activated.\nOur results showed that bicyclol has potential as a drug to treat obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular drugs and therapy", "date": "2022-06-25", "authors": ["YanghaoChen", "WanteLin", "LingfengZhong", "ZiminFang", "BozhiYe", "ZheWang", "NiponChattipakorn", "WeijianHuang", "GuangLiang", "GaojunWu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10557-022-07356-6\n10.1038/nrendo.2017.157\n10.1016/j.pcad.2018.07.011\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.11.006\n10.5114/aoms.2016.58928\n10.1016/j.mam.2018.07.001\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173796\n10.1016/j.psychres.2016.06.037\n10.1002/ptr.4640\n10.1248/bpb.b18-00915\n10.1186/s12906-018-2331-5\n10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107308\n10.1002/jcb.29310\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.041\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.02.059\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01438\n10.1016/j.brainres.2013.06.032\n10.1631/jzus.B1200263\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111874\n10.3390/ijms21197165\n10.1038/s41401-020-0410-x\n10.1684/ecn.2018.0415\n10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70134-2\n10.1172/JCI92035\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.111.964627\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.09.005\n10.2174/157340609787049316\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2013.11.001\n10.1016/j.pupt.2010.12.005\n10.1007/s00216-012-6658-3\n10.2337/db08-0038\n10.1016/j.taap.2017.11.003\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01286\n10.1038/ncomms13997\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111361\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112121\n10.1111/jfbc.12952"}

Thereby, we aim to uncover the role of miR-144-3p in HF. Doxorubicin (Dox)-induced HF model was constructed in rats and cardiomyocytes H9C2, and the cardiac function was determined using ultrasound cardiogram. Morphology of cardiac tissue was observed using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The viability and apoptosis of Dox-treated and transfected cardiomyocytes were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry. Relative expressions of the HF-associated miRs (including miR-144-3p), suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), apoptosis- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway-related factors (B-cell lymphoma 2, Bcl-2; Bcl-2 associated X protein, Bax; cleaved [C] capsase-3; phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PI3K; phosphorylated-PI3K, p-PI3K; p-AKT; AKT) were measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Target gene of miR-144-3p was predicted by Starbase and TargetScan and confirmed with dual-luciferase reporter assay. Dox caused rat cardiac dysfunction, aggravated cardiac injury, decreased cardiomyocytes viability, and the expression of miR-144-3p, Bcl-2, and phosphorylation of both PI3K and AKT yet the upregulated those of Bax and C caspase-3, which was reversed by upregulating miR-144-3p, whereas downregulating miR-144-3p did oppositely. SOCS2 was the target gene of miR-144-3p, Dox promoted SOCS2 expression, which was reversed by upregulating miR-144-3p, while downregulating miR-144-3p did conversely. In addition, silencing SOCS2 reversed the effects of miR-144-3p downregulation in Dox-treated cardiomyocytes.

The applied electric fields irreversibly permeabilize cell membranes and thereby kill myocytes while leaving the extracellular matrix intact.\nIn domestic pigs (n = 10), hearts were exposed via sternotomy and either ablated in vivo ([Formula: see text] = 5) or in excised, Langendorff-perfused hearts ([Formula: see text] = 5). The nsPEFs consisted of 6-36 pulses of 300 ns each, delivered at 3-6 Hz; the voltage applied varied from 10 to 12 kV. Atrial lesions were either created after inserting the bottom jaw of the bipolar clamp into the atrium via a purse string incision (2-3 lesions per atrium) or by clamping a double layer of tissue at the appendages (one lesion per atrium). Ventricular lesions were created after an incision at the apex. The transmurality of each lesion was determined at three points along the lesion using a triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain.\nAll 27 atrial lesions were transmural. This includes 13/13 purse string lesions (39/39 sections, tissue thickness 2.5-4.5 mm) and 14/14 appendage lesions (42/42 sections, tissue thickness 8-12 mm). All 3 right ventricular lesions were transmural (9/9 sections, 18 pulses per lesion). Left ventricular lesions were always transmural for 36 pulses (3/3 lesions, 9/9 sections). All lesions have highly consistent width across the wall.

Female Wistar Albino rats, whose hair of the dorsal skin was shaved, were exposed to a combined UVA\u2009+\u2009B radiation for 2 h/day, for 4\u2009weeks in order to be compared with the control group. Histopathological findings in vital organs (liver and heart) were evaluated. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH\u2009=\u20097.2) and embedded in paraffin. The histopathological findings were examined on the H&E stained sections with light microscopy. The results show that the liver and the heart were injured in the UVA\u2009+\u2009B group. Liver tissue in the UVA\u2009+\u2009B group showed minimal vacuolation, enlargement of hepatocytes and bile duct proliferation, and the heart tissue showed hibernomas; uniform large cells resembling brown fat with coarsely granular to multivacuolated cytoplasm that is eosinophilic or pale with a small central nucleus. The number of hibernoma cases was significantly higher in the UVA\u2009+\u2009B group compared with the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.021). The control group showed normal liver and heart histology with normal adipose tissue in the pericardium. As a result, UVA\u2009+\u2009B exposure has toxic effects, especially on the liver and the heart of Wistar albino rats. UV radiation may cause such adverse effects in humans.

Existing cell culture and animal models are limited in their capacity to decouple and tune specific hemodynamic stresses implicated in the development of physiological and pathophysiological cardiac tissue remodeling. This study focused on creating a system to subject engineered cardiac tissue to either pressure or stretch stimuli in isolation and the subsequent evaluation of acute tissue remodeling. We developed a cardiac tissue chip containing three-dimensional (3-D) cell-laden hydrogel constructs and cultured them within systems where we could expose them to either pressure changes or volume changes as seen in the left ventricle. Acute cellular remodeling with each condition was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed using histology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression studies, and soluble factor analysis. Using our unique model system, we isolated the effects of pressure and stretch on engineered cardiac tissue. Our results confirm that both pressure and stretch mediate acute stress responses in the engineered cardiac tissue. However, both experimental conditions elicited a similar acute phase injury response within this timeframe.

{"title": "Electroacupuncture at BL15 attenuates chronic fatigue syndrome by downregulating iNOS/NO signaling in C57BL/6 mice.", "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has a high incidence due to the increased pressure of daily life and work in modern society. Our previous clinical studies have found the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on CFS patients, however, the mechanism of EA on CFS is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of EA on cardiac function in a CFS mouse model to explore its underlying mechanism. The mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, CFS, and CFS mice receiving EA (CFS\u2009+\u2009EA). After behavioral assessments and echocardiographic measurement, blood and heart tissue of the mice were collected for biochemical tests, and then we evaluated the effects of EA on the CFS mouse model when nitric oxide (NO) levels were enhanced by l-arginine. The results showed that EA ameliorated the injured motor and cardiac function. Meanwhile, EA also inhibited increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at heart tissue and the serum NO levels in mice subjected to sustained forced swimming stress. Furthermore, the NO level in serum increased with l-arginine administration, which blocked the effects of EA on CFS mice. This study suggested that EA could improve the motor function and cardiac function in CFS mice and its effects may be associated with the down-regulation of iNOS/NO signaling.\n\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u793e\u4f1a\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u538b\u529b\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0, \u6162\u6027\u75b2\u52b3\u7efc\u5408\u5f81(CFS)\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7535\u9488(EA)\u5bf9CFS\u60a3\u8005\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7136\u800c, EA\u6cbb\u7597CFS\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d, \u6211\u4eec\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86EA\u5bf9CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u6a21\u578b\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5c06\u5c0f\u9f20\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ec4:\u7a7a\u767d\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4, CFS\u7ec4\u4ee5\u53caCFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u63a5\u53d7EA\u5e72\u9884(CFS\u2009+\u2009EA)\u7ec4\u3002\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u8d85\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e, \u6536\u96c6\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u8840\u6db2\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b, \u968f\u540e\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f53L-\u7cbe\u6c28\u9178\u4e0a\u8c03\u4e00\u6c27\u5316\u6c2e(NO)\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b, EA\u5e72\u9884CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, EA\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6, EA\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u8feb\u6e38\u6cf3\u5e94\u6fc0\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u578b\u4e00\u6c27\u5316\u6c2e\u5408\u9176(iNOS)\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u8840\u6e05NO\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u6b64\u5916, L-\u7cbe\u6c28\u9178\u7ed9\u836f\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u8840\u6e05\u4e2d\u7684NO\u6c34\u5e73, \u4ece\u800c\u963b\u65ad\u4e86EA\u5bf9CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e, \u7535\u9488\u53ef\u6539\u5584CFS\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd, \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5bf9iNOS/NO\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e0b\u8c03\u6709\u5173\u3002.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2022-05-25", "authors": ["YangZhu", "JingyaWang", "LinYao", "YunxuanHuang", "HaitaoYang", "XiaojiangYu", "XinghuaChen", "YongjunChen"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.24953"}

Unfortunately, the optimal method to maximize AMSCs differentiation has not yet been established. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which contains rich growth factors, is believed to stimulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the context of cardiac tissue regeneration.\nThis study aimed to analyze the effect of PRP administration to enhance the differentiation of AMSCs into cardiomyocytes.\nThis study used a randomized post-test-only controlled group design. AMSCs were isolated from adipose tissues and cultured for 4 passages. The samples were divided into 3 groups, a negative control group (\u03b1-MEM), a positive control group (differentiation medium), and a treatment group (PRP). The assessment of GATA-4 expression was conducted using flow cytometry on day-5. The assessment of troponin expression was conducted using immunocytochemistry on day- 10. Data analysis was conducted using T-test and One-Way ANOVA.\nFlowcytometry of GATA-4 expression revealed a significant improvement in PRP group compared to negative and positive control group (67.04 \u00b1 4.49 vs. 58.15 \u00b1 1.23 p < 0.05; 67.04 \u00b1 4.49 vs. 52.96 \u00b1 2.02 p < 0.05). This was supported by the results of immunocytochemistry on troponin expression, which revealed significant improvement in the PRP group compared to negative and positive controls (38.13 \u00b1 5.2 vs. 10.73 \u00b1 2.39 p < 0.05; 38.13 \u00b1 5.2 vs. 26.00 \u00b1 0.4 p < 0.05).\nPRP administration in the AMSCs culture could significantly improve the differentiation of AMSCs into cardiomyocytes measured by GATA-4 and troponin expressions.

SKI was intragastric administration for 7\u00a0days after MI. Masson staining was then conducted to measure the area of fibrosis in the myocardium. The expression levels of collagen I and collagen III were analyzed using Western blot. The levels of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and inflammatory factor were also detected. The expression of M1 polarization markers and M2 polarization markers in mice and LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells were detected using RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Finally, the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro were analyzed using transwell and EDU, respectively.\nSKI improved cardiac function and cardiac fibrosis in mice with MI. SKI also decreased collagen I and collagen III expression, and inhibited inflammatory factor TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels. SKI decreased the levels of MDA and increased the levels of GSH and SOD. Meanwhile, SKI could promote M2 macrophage polarization in vivo and in vitro.

We aimed to investigate for any role of rutin against diclofenac-induced cardiac injury with underlying mechanisms as there is no such precedent to date. The effect of rutin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) was evaluated upon concomitant oral administration for fifteen days with diclofenac (10\u2009mg/kg). Rutin significantly attenuated diclofenac-induced alterations in the serum cardiac markers (LDH, CK-MB, and SGOT), serum cytokine levels (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), and oxidative stress markers (MDA and GSH) in the cardiac tissue. Histopathological examination and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) findings displayed a marked effect of rutin to prevent diclofenac-mediated cardiac injury. Altered protein expression of myocardial injury markers (cTnT, FABP3, and ANP) and apoptotic markers (Bcl-2 and Caspase-3) in the cardiac tissue upon diclofenac treatment was considerably shielded by rutin treatment. MYL3 was unaffected due to diclofenac or rutin treatment. Rutin also significantly improved diclofenac-induced gastrointestinal and hepatic alterations based on the observed ameliorative effects in key mediators, oxidative stress markers, histopathology examination, and SEM findings. Overall results suggest that rutin can protect the diclofenac-induced cardiac injury by lowering oxidative stress, inhibiting inflammation, and reducing apoptosis.

{"title": "Update on the roles of imaging in the management of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.", "abstract": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), classified as group 4 pulmonary hypertension (PH), is caused by stenosis and obstruction of the pulmonary arteries by organized thrombi that are incompletely resolved after acute pulmonary embolism. The prognosis of patients with CTEPH is poor if untreated; however, in expert centers with multidisciplinary teams, a treatment strategy for CTEPH has been established, dramatically improving its prognosis. CTEPH is currently not a fatal disease and is the only curable form of PH. Despite these advances and the establishment of treatment approaches, early diagnosis is still challenging, especially for non-experts, for several reasons. One of the reasons for this is insufficient knowledge of the various diagnostic imaging modalities, which are essential in the clinical practice of CTEPH. Imaging modalities should detect the following pathological findings: lung perfusion defects, thromboembolic lesions in pulmonary arteries, and right ventricular remodeling and dysfunction. Perfusion lung scintigraphy and catheter angiography have long been considered gold standards for the detection of perfusion defects and assessment of vascular lesions, respectively. However, advances in imaging technology of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have enabled the non-invasive detection of these abnormal findings in a single examination. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for evaluating the morphology and function of the right heart; however, state-of-the-art techniques in CMR allow the assessment of cardiac tissue characterization and hemodynamics in the pulmonary arteries. Comprehensive knowledge of the role of imaging in CTEPH enables appropriate use of imaging modalities and accurate image interpretation, resulting in early diagnosis, determination of treatment strategies, and appropriate evaluation of treatment efficacy.

Fluvastatin (FV) is a fully synthetic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor used as a cholesterol-lowering agent in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies revealed that FV also exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activity. Additionally, our previous study indicated that FV exerts a prophylactic effect on DOXO-induced testicular toxicity by preventing lipid peroxidation, supporting the antioxidant system, and regulating the blood-testis barrier-associated genes expression. Herein, we purposed to evaluate the possible therapeutic and the protective effects of FV on the DOXO-induced cardiac and renal toxicitiy model by histochemical, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) analyses. Results point out protective use of FV exerts a beneficial effect by repressing lipid peroxidation and by regulating the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide synthase endothelial (eNOS), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), and Caspase-3 (Casp3) protein and mRNA expressions, which play an important role in mediating DOXO-induced renal and cardiac toxicity mechanisms.

{"title": "Silk-Based Matrices and c-Kit-Positive Cardiac Progenitor Cells for a Cellularized Silk Fibroin Scaffold: Study of an in vivo Model.", "abstract": "The production of a cellularized silk fibroin scaffold is very difficult because it is actually impossible to differentiate cells into a well-organized cardiac tissue. Without vascularization, not only do cell masses fail to grow, but they may also exhibit an area of necrosis, indicating a lack of oxygen and nutrients. In the present study, we used the so-called tyrosine protein kinase kit (c-Kit)-positive cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) to generate cardiac cellularized silk fibroin scaffolds, multipotent cells isolated from the adult heart to date that can show some degree of differentiation toward the cardiac phenotype. To test their ability to differentiate into the cardiac phenotype in vivo as well, CPC and collagen organoid-like masses were implanted into nude mice and their behavior observed. Since the 3-dimensional structure of cardiac tissue can be preserved by scaffolds, we prepared in parallel different silk fibroin scaffolds with 3 different geometries and tested their behavior in 3 different models of immunosuppressed animals. Unfortunately, CPC cellularized silk fibroin scaffolds cannot be used in vivo. CPCs implanted alone or in collagen type I gel were destroyed by CD3+ lymphocyte aggregates, whereas the porous and partially oriented scaffolds elicited a consistent foreign body response characterized by giant cells. Only the electrospun meshes were resistant to the foreign body reaction. In conclusion, c-Kit-positive CPCs, although expressing a good level of cardiac differentiation markers in vitro with or without fibroin meshes, are not suitable for an in vivo model of cardiac organoids because they are degraded by a T-cell-mediated immune response. Even scaffolds which may preserve the survival of these cells in vivo also induced a host response.

But, current available myocardial prostheses like a Dacron or a pericardium patch neither have a regenerative capacity nor do they actively contribute to the heart's pump function. This study aimed to show the feasibility of utilizing a vascularized stomach patch for transmural left ventricular wall reconstruction.\nA left ventricular transmural myocardial defect was reconstructed by performing transdiaphragmatic autologous transplantation of a vascularized stomach segment in six Lewe minipigs. Three further animals received a conventional Dacron patch as a control treatment. The first 3 animals were followed up for 3 months until planned euthanasia, whereas the observation period for the remaining 3 animals was scheduled 6 months following surgery. Functional assessment of the grafts was carried out via cardiac magnetic resonance tomography and angiography. Physiological remodeling was evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically after heart explantation.\nFive out of six test animals and all control animals survived the complex surgery and completed the follow-up without clinical complications. One animal died intraoperatively due to excessive bleeding. No animal experienced rupture of the stomach graft. Functional integration of the heterotopically transplanted stomach into the surrounding myocardium was observed. Angiography showed development of connections between the gastric graft vasculature and the coronary system of the host cardiac tissue.\nThe clinical results and the observed physiological integration of gastric grafts into the cardiac structure demonstrate the feasibility of vascularized stomach tissue as myocardial prosthesis. The physiological remodeling indicates a regenerative potential of the graft.

{"title": "Controlling Morphology and Functions of Cardiac Organoids by Two-Dimensional Geometrical Templates.", "abstract": "Traditionally, tissue-specific organoids are generated as 3D aggregates of stem cells embedded in Matrigel or hydrogels, and the aggregates eventually end up a spherical shape and suspended in the matrix. Lack of geometrical control of organoid formation makes these spherical organoids limited for modeling the tissues with complex shapes. To address this challenge, we developed a new method to generate 3D spatial-organized cardiac organoids from 2D micropatterned human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies, instead of directly from 3D stem cell aggregates. This new approach opens the possibility to create cardiac organoids that are templated by 2D non-spherical geometries, which potentially provides us a deeper understanding of biophysical controls on developmental organogenesis. Here, we designed 2D geometrical templates with quadrilateral shapes and pentagram shapes that had same total area but different geometrical shapes. Using this templated substrate, we grew cardiac organoids from hiPSCs and collected a series of parameters to characterize morphological and functional properties of the cardiac organoids. In quadrilateral templates, we found that increasing the aspect ratio impaired cardiac tissue 3D self-assembly, but the elongated geometry improved the cardiac contractile functions. However, in pentagram templates, cardiac organoid structure and function were optimized with a specific geometry of an ideal star shape.

MCC950 (10\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle was administered via intraperitoneal injection immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Myocardial function and sublingual microcirculation were measured after ROSC in the non-survival subgroups. Plasma levels of interleukin I\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were measured at baseline and 6\u00a0h in the non-survival subgroups. Heart tissue was harvested to measure the NLRP3 inflammasome constituents, including NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), Caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2. Survival duration and neurologic deficit score (NDS) were recorded and evaluated among survival groups.\nPost-resuscitation myocardial function and sublingual microcirculation were improved in MCC950 compared with control (p\u2009<\u20090.05). IL-1\u03b2 and cTnI were decreased in MCC950 compared to control (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The MCC950 treated groups showed significantly reduced ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2 compared with the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Survival at 48\u00a0h after ROSC was greater in MCC950 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with improved NDS (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nAdministration of MCC950 following ROSC mitigates post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction and improves survival.", "journal": "Cardiovascular drugs and therapy", "date": "2022-01-02", "authors": ["GuanghuiZheng", "FenglianHe", "JingXu", "JuntaoHu", "WeiweiGe", "XianfeiJi", "ChangshengWang", "Jennifer LBradley", "Mary AnnPeberdy", "Joseph POrnato", "LongyuanJiang", "StefanoToldo", "TongWang", "WanchunTang"], "doi": "10.1007/s10557-021-07282-z\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.190652\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.08.124\n10.1007/s00101-012-2002-8\n10.1007/s40119-018-0104-3\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.08.037\n10.1155/2017/9743280\n10.1038/nrcardio.2017.161\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.02.043\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000247\n10.1038/s41598-018-24350-x\n10.1159/000488183\n10.1038/nm.3806\n10.1089/neu.2017.5344\n10.1016/j.bmc.2020.115954\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000003415\n10.1152/ajpheart.01171.2003\n10.1097/00003246-199307000-00022\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00270-3\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.062257\n10.1016/j.ehj.2004.10.021\n10.1016/0300-9572(84)90062-5\n10.1007/s00134-004-2425-z\n10.1016/0300-9572(94)00811-S\n10.1161/01.CIR.77.1.234\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003199\n10.1093/cvr/cvt123\n10.1038/s41589-019-0277-7"}
{"title": "Heart development and regeneration-a multi-organ effort.", "abstract": "Development of the heart, from early morphogenesis to functional maturation, as well as maintenance of its homeostasis are tasks requiring collaborative efforts of cardiac tissue and different extra-cardiac organ systems. The brain, lymphoid organs, and gut are among the interaction partners that can communicate with the heart through a wide array of paracrine signals acting at local or systemic level. Disturbance of cardiac homeostasis following ischemic injury also needs immediate response from these distant organs. Our hearts replace dead muscles with non-contractile fibrotic scars. We have learned from animal models capable of scarless repair that regenerative capability of the heart does not depend only on competency of the myocardium and cardiac-intrinsic factors but also on long-range molecular signals originating in other parts of the body. Here, we provide an overview of inter-organ signals that take part in development and regeneration of the heart. We highlight recent findings and remaining questions. Finally, we discuss the potential of inter-organ modulatory approaches for possible therapeutic use.", "journal": "The FEBS journal", "date": "2021-12-12", "authors": ["AlessandroFilosa", "SuphansaSawamiphak"], "doi": "10.1111/febs.16319"}
