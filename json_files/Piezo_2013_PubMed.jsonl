The technique is based on the wide-band forward mode detection of temporal profiles of laser-generated ultrasonic pulses (optoacoustic signals).

The determination of iron(II) as ferroin shows the possibility of probing 0.1\u00a0mol\u00a0l(-1) of iron(II), which was not previously achieved for this reaction by optical spectroscopy. To further prove the concept, kinetic measurements for ferroin decomposition at the level of 0.1\u00a0mol\u00a0l(-1) and at high pHs are performed.

A method for localizing the device by interpreting this flashing as movement is presented here. An ultrasound Doppler scan sequence is implemented using a programmable scanner, and radio-frequency data are collected and processed. The data are then analyzed for different excitation lengths and flashing frequencies to determine the optimum detection parameters. Measurements show that 1) detection can be achieved and is maximal when the excitation length reaches that of the Doppler processing window, and 2) when the flashing frequency is in a specific range. A study of the incidence angle also showed that 3) the sensor of the device can be detected over a given angular window.

Alternative technologies such as capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUT) and optical sensing and generation of ultrasound have been proposed and studied for several decades. In this paper, we present a new type of device based on optical micromachined ultrasound transducer (OMUT) technology. OMUTs rely on microfabrication techniques to construct micrometerscale air cavities capped by an elastic membrane. A modified photoresist bonding process has been developed to facilitate the fabrication of these devices.

Analytical and numerical models are developed to clarify the effect of material parameters critical to the energy harvesting performance of the bending multilayer structure. It is shown that the maximum power is proportional to the square of the piezoelectric stress coefficient and the inverse of dielectric permittivity of the piezoelectric polymer. It is further found that a piezoelectric multilayer with thinner electrodes can generate more electric energy in bending mode. The effect of improved impedance matching in the multilayer polymer on energy output is remarkable. Comparisons between piezoelectric ceramic multilayers and polymer multilayers on flexible substrate are discussed. The fabrication of a P(VDF-TrFE) multilayer structure with a thin Al electrode layer is experimentally demonstrated by a scalable dip-coating process on a flexible aluminum substrate.

{"title": "An equivalent network representation of a clamped bimorph piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer with circular and annular electrodes using matrix manipulation techniques.", "abstract": "An electric circuit model for a clamped circular bimorph piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (pMUT) was developed for the first time. The pMUT consisted of two piezoelectric layers sandwiched between three thin electrodes. The top and bottom electrodes were separated into central and annular electrodes by a small gap. While the middle electrode was grounded, the central and annular electrodes were biased with two independent voltage sources. The strain mismatch between the piezoelectric layers caused the plate to vibrate and transmit a pressure wave, whereas the received echo generated electric charges resulting from plate deformation. The clamped pMUT plate was separated into a circular and an annular plate, and the respective electromechanical transformation matrices were derived. The force and velocity vectors were properly selected using Hamilton's principle and the necessary boundary conditions were invoked. The electromechanical transformation matrix for the clamped circular pMUT was deduced using simple matrix manipulation techniques. The pMUT performance under three biasing schemes was elaborated: 1) central electrode only, 2) central and annular electrodes with voltages of the same magnitude and polarity, and 3) central and annular electrodes with voltages of the same magnitude and opposite polarity. The circuit parameters of the pMUT were extracted for each biasing scheme, including the transformer ratio, the clamped electric impedance, and the open-circuit mechanical impedance. Each pMUT scheme was characterized under different acoustic loadings using the theoretically developed model, which was verified with finite element modeling (FEM) simulation. The electrode size was optimized to maximize the electromechanical transformer ratio. As such, the developed model could provide more insight into the design, optimization, and characterization of pMUTs and allow for performance comparison with their cMUT counterparts.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2014-03-25", "authors": ["FirasSammoura", "KatherineSmyth", "Sang-GookKim"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2784"}

Typically, ultrasonic standing waves are used; this approach is well established in fully enclosed microfluidic systems consisting of channels or chambers with an attached piezoelectric actuator. In this work, we examine the use of ultrasonic manipulation in open fluid films, which offer a high degree of accessibility. A piezoelectric actuator is presented which can be lowered into a separate fluid tray. This two-part system offers a high degree of flexibility; indeed the actuator can be removed with little disturbance to the particle patterns, so manipulation could potentially be periodically applied as required. Particle manipulation is shown to be possible over a distance many times the size of the actuator. Furthermore, particle manipulation can also be achieved in a tilted fluid film, so alignment between the two parts of the system is not critical to its operation.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2014-03-25", "authors": ["RobertJensen", "IanGralinski", "AdrianNeild"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2781"}

{"title": "Design considerations and performance of MEMS acoustoelectric ultrasound detectors.", "abstract": "Most single-element hydrophones depend on a piezoelectric material that converts pressure changes to electricity. These devices, however, can be expensive, susceptible to damage at high pressure, and/or have limited bandwidth and sensitivity. We have previously described the acoustoelectric (AE) hydrophone as an inexpensive alternative for mapping an ultrasound beam and monitoring acoustic exposure. The device exploits the AE effect, an interaction between electrical current flowing through a material and a propagating pressure wave. Previous designs required imprecise fabrication methods using common laboratory supplies, making it difficult to control basic features such as shape and size. This study describes a different approach based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) processing that allows for much finer control of several design features. In an effort to improve the performance of the AE hydrophone, we combine simulations with bench-top testing to evaluate key design features, such as thickness, shape, and conductivity of the active and passive elements. The devices were evaluated in terms of sensitivity, frequency response, and accuracy for reproducing the beam pattern. Our simulations and experimental results both indicated that designs using a combination of indium tin oxide (ITO) for the active element and gold for the passive electrodes (conductivity ratio = ~20) produced the best result for mapping the beam of a 2.25-MHz ultrasound transducer. Also, the AE hydrophone with a rectangular dumbbell configuration achieved a better beam pattern than other shape configurations. Lateral and axial resolutions were consistent with images generated from a commercial capsule hydrophone. Sensitivity of the best-performing device was 1.52 nV/Pa at 500 kPa using a bias voltage of 20 V. We expect a thicker AE hydrophone closer to half the acoustic wavelength to produce even better sensitivity, while maintaining high spectral bandwidth for characterizing medical ultrasound transducers. AE ultrasound detectors may also be useful for monitoring acoustic exposure during therapy or as receivers for photoacoustic imaging.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2014-03-25", "authors": ["ZhaohuiWang", "PierIngram", "Charles LGreenlee", "RagnarOlafsson", "Robert ANorwood", "Russell SWitte"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2775"}

The use of ultrasound at 20 kHz was applied to a dead-end microfiltration cell in order to mitigate fouling caused by the presence of colloidal bentonite particles. The effect of ultrasonic power and pulse duration on the permeate flux recovery was examined. Measurements indicate that an increase in ultrasonic power and longer pulse duration results to a higher permeate flux recovery. In order to reduce power consumption, a low to high power shift (LHPS) and pulsation method, were investigated. Methods of cleaning such as ultrasonic irradiation, ultrasonic cleaning with forward flushing and ultrasonic cleaning with backwashing were utilized and their cleaning efficiencies were examined. The cleaning performance was assessed using the clean water flux method and scanning electron microscope analysis of the cleaned membranes. Results showed that LHPS and pulsation method both improve the permeate flux recovery but were not able to attain the 93.97 and 74.88% flux recovery for PES and PVDF that was achieved by constant-15 W ultrasonic cleaning.

Key features of piezosurgery instruments include their ability to selectively cut bone without damaging adjacent soft tissue, to provide a clear operative field, and to cut without generating heat. Although piezosurgery instruments can be used at most stages of endodontic surgery (osteotomy, root-end resection, and root-end preparation), no published data are available on the effect of piezosurgery on the outcomes of endodontic surgery. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of piezosurgery on root-end resection, and only 1 has investigated root-end morphology after retrograde cavity preparation using piezosurgery.\nWe conducted a search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases using appropriate terms and keywords related to the use and applications of piezoelectric surgery in endodontic surgery.

The developed polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensor enables measurement of airflow through each side of the nose using its piezoelectric property. This study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic capability of the PVDF sensor in assessing the deviated nasal septum (DNS). PVDF nasal sensor uses its piezoelectric property to measure the peak-to-peak amplitude (Vp-p) of nasal airflow in both of the nostrils: right nostril (RN) and left nostril (LN), separately and simultaneously. We have compared the results of PVDF nasal sensor, visual analog scale (VAS), and clinician scale for 34 DNS patients and 28 healthy controls. Additionally, the results were further analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve and correlation between PVDF nasal sensor and VAS in detecting DNS.

Under unified conditions (membrane: PVDF-14W, temperature: 40 degreeC, pressure: 0. 1 MPa, membrane surface speed: 150 r min- 1), trans-membrane was conducted for above eight oil-bearing solutions to explore the effect of their oil-bearing solution environment on system flux and oil recovery rate. The results showed that systems with smaller pH had a lower flux, without significant effect on oil recovery rate. Greater differences between the surface tension of solutions and that of pure water contributed to a lower oil recovery rate. The conductivity had no notable effect on membrane enrichment process. Systems with high turbidity had a lower flux, without remarkable effect on oil recovery rat. Heavy oils showed lower flux than light ones, but with a slightly higher oil recovery rat. Systems with higher viscosity had a lower flux than those with lower viscosity. Except for Magnoliae Flos volatile oil, all of the remaining volatile oils showed a much higher oil recovery rat than systems with high viscosity.

The polypeptide pattern of the chaotrope-soluble wall fraction was strongly modified by chemical deglycosylation with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) in pyridine indicating that most of these polypeptides are glycosylated. Polypeptide constituents of the chaotrope-soluble cell-wall fraction with apparent molecular masses of 240, 270, 265, and 135 kDa cross-reacted with a polyclonal antibody raised against the 100 kDa deglycosylation product of the C. reinhardtii cell-wall glycoprotein GP3B. Chemical deglycosylation of the chaotrope-soluble wall fraction resulted in a 135 kDa major polypeptide and a 106 kDa minor component reacting with the same antibody. This antibody recognized specific peptide epitopes of GP3B. When the insoluble wall fraction of S. obliquus was treated with anhydrous HF/pyridine, three polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 144, 135, and 65 kDa were solubilized, which also occured in the deglycosylated chaotrope-soluble wall fraction.

{"title": "Design, analysis and testing of a parallel-kinematic high-bandwidth XY nanopositioning stage.", "abstract": "This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of a parallel-kinematic high-bandwidth XY nanopositioning stage driven by piezoelectric stack actuators. The stage is designed with two kinematic chains. In each kinematic chain, the end-effector of the stage is connected to the base by two symmetrically distributed flexure modules, respectively. Each flexure module comprises a fixed-fixed beam and a parallelogram flexure serving as two orthogonal prismatic joints. With the purpose to achieve high resonance frequencies of the stage, a novel center-thickened beam which has large stiffness is proposed to act as the fixed-fixed beam. The center-thickened beam also contributes to reducing cross-coupling and restricting parasitic motion. To decouple the motion in two axes totally, a symmetric configuration is adopted for the parallelogram flexures. Based on the analytical models established in static and dynamic analysis, the dimensions of the stage are optimized in order to maximize the first resonance frequency. Then finite element analysis is utilized to validate the design and a prototype of the stage is fabricated for performance tests. According to the results of static and dynamic tests, the resonance frequencies of the developed stage are over 13.6 kHz and the workspace is 11.2 \u03bcm \u00d7 11.6 \u03bcm with the cross-coupling between two axes less than 0.52%. It is clearly demonstrated that the developed stage has high resonance frequencies, a relatively large travel range, and nearly decoupled performance between two axes. For high-speed tracking performance tests, an inversion-based feedforward controller is implemented for the stage to compensate for the positioning errors caused by mechanical vibration. The experimental results show that good tracking performance at high speed is achieved, which validates the effectiveness of the developed stage.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2014-01-07", "authors": ["Chun-XiaLi", "Guo-YingGu", "Mei-JuYang", "Li-MinZhu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4848876"}

New and upgraded laser methods and techniques developed by national metrology institutes and by leading manufacturers in the past two decades have been swiftly specified as standard methods in the ISO 16063 series of international document standards. In ISO 16063-11:1999, three interferometric methods are specified for the primary calibration of vibration transducers (reference standard accelerometers) in a frequency range from 1 Hz to 10 kHz. In order to specify the same (modified) methods for the calibration of laser vibrometers (ISO 16063-41:2011), their applicability in an expanded frequency range was investigated. Steady-state sinusoidal vibrations were generated by piezoelectric actuators at specific frequencies up to 347 kHz (acceleration amplitudes up to 376 km/s(2)). The displacement amplitude, adjusted by the special interferometric method of coincidence to 158.2 nm (quarter the wavelength of the He-Ne laser light), was measured by the standardized interferometric methods of fringe counting and sine-approximation. The deviations between the measurement results of the three interferometric methods applied simultaneously were smaller than 1%. The limits of measurement uncertainty specified in ISO 16063-11 between 1 Hz to 10 kHz were kept up to frequencies, which are orders of magnitude greater; the uncertainty limit 0.5% specified at the reference frequency 160 Hz was not exceeded at 160 kHz. The reported results were considered during the development of ISO 16063-41 by specifying the instrumentation and procedures for performing calibrations of rectilinear laser vibrometers in the frequency range typically between 0.4 Hz and 50 kHz--the interferometric methods may be applied within expanded frequency ranges using refined techniques and procedures.

Circulating FAP activity was \u223c20- and 1.3-fold less in baboon than in mouse and human plasma, respectively. Serum and plasma contained comparable FAP activity. In mice, the highest levels of FAP activity were in uterus, pancreas, submaxillary gland and skin, whereas the lowest levels were in brain, prostate, leukocytes and testis. Baboon organs high in FAP activity included skin, epididymis, bladder, colon, adipose tissue, nerve and tongue. FAP activity was greatly elevated in tumours and associated lymph nodes and in fungal-infected skin of unhealthy baboons.

However, therapeutic mechanisms involved in vivo are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to explain the dose-effects and molecular mechanisms of GTW on GS by regulating TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling activity in adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy (ADRN).\nRats with ADRN, created by unilateral nephrectomy and twice adriamycin injections (ADR, 4 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) within 4 weeks, were divided into four groups, the Sham group, the Vehicle group, the low-dose GTW-treated group, and the high-dose GTW-treated group, and that, sacrificed at the end of the 6th week after administration.

{"title": "Development of a multi-channel piezoelectric acoustic sensor based on an artificial basilar membrane.", "abstract": "In this research, we have developed a multi-channel piezoelectric acoustic sensor (McPAS) that mimics the function of the natural basilar membrane capable of separating incoming acoustic signals mechanically by their frequency and generating corresponding electrical signals. The McPAS operates without an external energy source and signal processing unit with a vibrating piezoelectric thin film membrane. The shape of the vibrating membrane was chosen to be trapezoidal such that different locations of membrane have different local resonance frequencies. The length of the membrane is 28 mm and the width of the membrane varies from 1 mm to 8 mm. Multiphysics finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to predict and design the mechanical behaviors and piezoelectric response of the McPAS model. The designed McPAS was fabricated with a MEMS fabrication process based on the simulated results. The fabricated device was tested with a mouth simulator to measure its mechanical and piezoelectrical frequency response with a laser Doppler vibrometer and acoustic signal analyzer. The experimental results show that the as fabricated McPAS can successfully separate incoming acoustic signals within the 2.5 kHz-13.5 kHz range and the maximum electrical signal output upon acoustic signal input of 94 dBSPL was 6.33 mVpp. The performance of the fabricated McPAS coincided well with the designed parameters.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2013-12-24", "authors": ["YoungdoJung", "Jun-HyukKwak", "Young HwaLee", "Wan DooKim", "ShinHur"], "doi": "10.3390/s140100117"}

The stator of the motor is composed of a metal plate and eight piezoelectric ceramic patches. There are four long holes in the plate, designed for consideration of the longitudinal and bending mode coupling. The corresponding model is developed to optimize the mechanical and electrical coupling of the stator, which causes an ellipse motion at the contact tip of the stator when the composite vibrations with longitudinal and bending are excited. Its harmonic and transient responses are simulated and inspected. A prototype based on the model is fabricated and used to conduct experiments. Results show that the amplitude of the stator's contact tips is significantly increased, which helps to amplify the driving force and speed of the motor. It is therefore feasible to implement effective linear movement using the developed prototype.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-12-24", "authors": ["ZhijianWan", "HongHu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.11.004"}

The inclusion of a metabolic inhibitor, NaN3, into the nutrient broth eliminated bacteria metabolic activity according to the OD data, the absence of which was confirmed using AE data acquisition. The OD and AE data were also acquired before and after the addition of Bacteriophage c2 in L. lactis containing nutrient broths during the early or middle logarithmic phase; c2 phage m.o.i.

We observed that RGC and glia can be successfully printed using a piezoelectric printer. Whilst inkjet printing reduced the cell population due to sedimentation within the printing system, imaging of the printhead nozzle, which is the area where the cells experience the greatest shear stress and rate, confirmed that there was no evidence of destruction or even significant distortion of the cells during jet ejection and drop formation. Importantly, the viability of the cells was not affected by the printing process. When we cultured the same number of printed and non-printed RGC/glial cells, there was no significant difference in cell survival and RGC neurite outgrowth. In addition, use of a glial substrate significantly increased RGC neurite outgrowth, and this effect was retained when the cells had been printed. In conclusion, printing of RGC and glia using a piezoelectric printhead does not adversely affect viability and survival/growth of the cells in culture.

{"title": "Electromagnetic fields for treating osteoarthritis.", "abstract": "This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002. Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects the synovial joints, causing degeneration and destruction of hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone. Electromagnetic field therapy is currently used by physiotherapists and may promote growth and repair of bone and cartilage. It is based on principles of physics which include Wolff's law, the piezoelectric effect and the concept of streaming potentials.\nTo assess the benefits and harms of electromagnetic fields for the treatment of osteoarthritis as compared to placebo or sham.\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), PreMEDLINE for trials published before 1966, MEDLINE from 1966 to October 2013, CINAHL and PEDro up to and including October 2013. Electronic searches were complemented by handsearches.\nRandomised controlled trials of electromagnetic fields in osteoarthritis, with four or more weeks treatment duration. We included papers in any language.\nTwo review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review and resolved differences by consensus with a third review author. We extracted data using pre-developed data extraction forms. The same review authors assessed the risk of bias of the trials independently using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We extracted outcomes for osteoarthritis from the publications according to Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) guidelines. We expressed results for continuous outcome measures as mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We pooled dichotomous outcome measures using risk ratio (RR) and calculated the number needed to treat (NNT).\nNine studies with a total of 636 participants with osteoarthritis were included, six of which were added in this update of the review. Selective outcome reporting was unclear in all nine included studies due to inadequate reporting of study design and conduct, and there was high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data in three studies. The overall risk of bias across the nine studies was low for the other domains.Participants who were randomised to electromagnetic field treatment rated their pain relief 15.10 points more on a scale of 0 to 100 (MD 15.10, 95% CI 9.08 to 21.13; absolute improvement 15%) after 4 to 26 weeks' treatment compared with placebo. Electromagnetic field treatment had no statistically significant effect on physical function (MD 4.55, 95% CI -2.23 to 11.32; absolute improvement 4.55%) based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) scale from 0 to 100 after 12 to 26 weeks' treatment. We also found no statistically significant difference in quality of life on a scale from 0 to 100 (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.54; absolute improvement 0.09%) after four to six weeks' treatment, based on the SF-36. No data were available for analysis of radiographic changes. Safety was evaluated in four trials including up to 288 participants: there was no difference in the experience of any adverse event after 4 to 12 weeks of treatment compared with placebo (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92). There was no difference in participants who withdrew because of adverse events (measured in one trial) after four weeks of treatment (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.92). No participants experienced any serious adverse events.\nCurrent evidence suggests that electromagnetic field treatment may provide moderate benefit for osteoarthritis sufferers in terms of pain relief. Further studies are required to confirm whether this treatment confers clinically important benefits in terms of physical function and quality of life.

To overcome this drawback, controlled immunoglobulin G (IgG) immobilization onto poly(vinylidene fluoride) surface was investigated in this paper. A two-step process involving radiofrequency plasma pretreatment for polymer surface functionalization, followed by coupling reaction was developed, after which immunoglobulin G was immobilized onto the surface directly or via protein-A. IR and XPS data proved that the process is more efficient when the radiofrequency plasma pretreatment was performed using N2 and N2/H2 as discharge gases. NIR-CI, AFM and XPS surface evaluation revealed that immobilization of IgG onto N2/H2 plasma-treated PVDF via grafted protein-A was achieved with an ends-on orientation, leaving available the antigen binding sites of IgG. This procedure could be a promising route for the preparation of oriented IgG assembly onto PVDF, useful in biomedical, membranes or sensors applications.

To this end we have identified three noncontiguous segments of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) \u03b1-subunit that contribute to the conformationally sensitive immunological hotspot on the AChR termed the main immunogenic region (MIR): \u03b1(1-12), \u03b1(65-79), and \u03b1(110-115).

Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised in one species against an electric organ AChR cross react with the neuromuscular AChR MIR in several species. Probing the Torpedo AChR \u03b1-subunit with mAb 132A, a disease inducing anti-MIR mAb raised against the Torpedo AChR, we have determined that two of the three MIR segments, \u03b1(1-12) and \u03b1(65-79), form a complex providing the signature components recognized by mAb 132A. These two segments straddle a third, \u03b1(110-115), that seems not to contribute specific side chains for 132A recognition, but is necessary for optimum antibody binding.

{"title": "A hardware model of the auditory periphery to transduce acoustic signals into neural activity.", "abstract": "To improve the performance of cochlear implants, we have integrated a microdevice into a model of the auditory periphery with the goal of creating a microprocessor. We constructed an artificial peripheral auditory system using a hybrid model in which polyvinylidene difluoride was used as a piezoelectric sensor to convert mechanical stimuli into electric signals. To produce frequency selectivity, the slit on a stainless steel base plate was designed such that the local resonance frequency of the membrane over the slit reflected the transfer function. In the acoustic sensor, electric signals were generated based on the piezoelectric effect from local stress in the membrane. The electrodes on the resonating plate produced relatively large electric output signals. The signals were fed into a computer model that mimicked some functions of inner hair cells, inner hair cell-auditory nerve synapses, and auditory nerve fibers. In general, the responses of the model to pure-tone burst and complex stimuli accurately represented the discharge rates of high-spontaneous-rate auditory nerve fibers across a range of frequencies greater than 1 kHz and middle to high sound pressure levels. Thus, the model provides a tool to understand information processing in the peripheral auditory system and a basic design for connecting artificial acoustic sensors to the peripheral auditory nervous system.

Removal of the first 16 or 19 AAs of the N-terminus resulted in a molecule with reduced ability to sequester [(3)H]-5HT.

These putative phosphorylation sites were examined for effects on function. Phospho-mimetic substitution of serines 15 and 18 with aspartate in the full-length VMAT2 resulted in reduced [(3)H]-5HT sequestration and reduced methamphetamine (METH)-stimulated efflux of preloaded [(3)H]-5HT. In contrast, mutation of serines 15 and 18 to alanines maintained intact net substrate sequestration but eliminated METH-stimulated efflux of pre-accumulated [(3)H]-5HT.

BT-Ag hybrid particles were synthesized via a seed-mediated growing process by a redox reaction between silver nitrate and ethylene glycol. Nano Ag particles with a size less than 20 nm were discretely grown on the surface of the 100 nm BaTiO3. The similar lattice spacing of the (1 1 1) planes of BT and Ag led to the hetero-epitaxial growth of Ag on the BT surface. The thickness of the coherent interface was about 3 nm. The adhesion of Ag to BT efficiently prevented the continuous contact between Ag particles in the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix and suppressed the formation of the conducting path in the composite. As a result, with a filler loading of 43.4 vol %, the composite exhibited a dielectric constant (Dk) value of 94.3 and dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of 0.06 at 1 kHz. An even higher Dk value of 160 at 1 kHz (16 times larger than that of PVDF) was obtained when the content of BT-Ag was further increased, with low conductivity (\u03c3 < 10(-5) S m(-1)) and low dielectric loss (tan \u03b4 = 0.11), demonstrating promising applications in the electronic devices.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2013-12-11", "authors": ["SuibinLuo", "ShuhuiYu", "RongSun", "Ching-PingWong"], "doi": "10.1021/am404556c"}
{"title": "An elastography method based on the scanning contact resonance of a piezoelectric cantilever.", "abstract": "Most tissues may become significantly stiffer than their normal states when there are lesions inside. The tissue's modulus can then act as an identification parameter for clinic diagnosis of tumors or fibrosis, which leads to elastography. This study introduces a novel elastography method that can be used for modulus imaging of superficial organs.\nThis method is based on the scanning contact-resonance of a unimorph piezoelectric cantilever. The cantilever vibrates in its bending mode with the tip pressed tightly on the sample. The contact resonance frequency of the cantilever-sample system is tracked at each scanning point, from which the sample's modulus can be derived based on a beam dynamic model and a contact mechanics model. Scanning is performed by a three-dimensional motorized stage and the whole system is controlled by a homemade software program based on LabVIEW.\nTesting on in vitro beef tissues indicates that the fat and the muscle can be easily distinguished using this system, and the accuracy of the modulus measurement can be comparable with that of nanoindentation. Imaging on homemade gelatin phantoms shows that the depth information of the abnormalities can be qualitatively obtained by varying the pressing force. The detection limit of this elastography method is specially examined both experimentally and numerically. Results show that it can detect the typical lesions in superficial organs with the depth of several centimeters. The lateral resolution of this elastography method\u2215system is better than 0.5 mm, and could be further enhanced by using more scanning points.\nThe proposed elastography system can be regarded as a sensitive palpation robot, which may be very promising in early diagnosis of tumors in superficial organs such as breast and thyroid.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2013-12-11", "authors": ["JiFu", "FaxinLi"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4829502"}

Preliminary investigation into the effectiveness of the device at producing cortical and subcortical activity was also conducted with a group of seven healthy subjects. The vibration was applied to the right extensor carpi ulnaris tendon to induce a kinesthetic illusion of flexion and extension of the wrist.\nThe MRI compatibility tests showed the device did not produce image artifacts and the generated electromagnetic field did not disrupt the static magnetic field of the scanner or its operation. The subject group results showed activity in the contralateral putamen, premotor cortex, and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Ipsilaterally, there was increased activity in the superior and inferior parietal lobules. Areas that activated bilaterally included the thalamus, anterior cingulate, secondary somatosensory areas (S2), temporal lobes, and visual association areas.\nThis device offers an effective tool with precise control over the vibratory stimulus, delivering higher forces than some other types of devices (e.g., piezoelectric actuators).

Tips were applied either with the tip end or with the side facing downwards. Detached bacteria were determined in the supernatant and colony-forming units (CFUs) counted after 72 h of incubation. Untreated specimens served as controls. Moreover, the biofilms remaining on the hydroxyapatite surface after treatment were stained using the Live/Dead stain, and the pattern of their detachment was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).\nAs compared to the untreated control, it was found that only a side application of the magnetostrictive device was able to remove efficiently the biofilm. In contrast, its tip application as well as both applications of the piezoelectric device removed significantly less bacteria from the biofilm structure. These findings were corroborated by CLSM observation.\nBoth ultrasonic tips under investigations led to bacterial detachment, but the action mode as well as the tip configuration and adaptation appeared to be influenced by the biofilm removal effectiveness.\nBiofilm removal remains a main goal of ultrasonic debridement.

The resultant composite (PPN) demonstrated high reactivity, excellent stability and reusability over the reaction course. Such excellent performance might be attributed to the presence of the charged carboxyl groups in PVDF membrane support, which could enhance NZVI dispersion and improve its longevity. Results showed that a lower initial concentration and higher reaction temperature facilitated the removal of MNZ by PPN, and that the acidic and neutral conditions generally exhibited more favorable effect on MNZ removal than the alkaline ones. Kinetics of the MNZ removal by PPN was found to follow a two-parameter pseudo-first-order decay model well, and the activation energy of the MNZ degradation by PPN was determined to be 30.49kJ/mol. The presence of chloride ions slightly enhanced the reactivity of PPN with MNZ, whereas sulfate ions inhibited its reactivity. In addition, MNZ degradation pathways by PPN were proposed based on the identified intermediates.

{"title": "Portable acoustic myography - a realistic noninvasive method for assessment of muscle activity and coordination in human subjects in most home and sports settings.", "abstract": "Muscle sound gives a local picture of muscles involved in a particular movement and is independent of electrical signals between nerve and muscle. Sound recording (acoustic myography) is a well-known noninvasive technique that has suffered from not being easily applicable, as well as not being able to register at sufficient sampling speed. With modern amplifiers and digital sound recording this has changed, and such assessment during movement outside a laboratory setting may be possible. Our aim was to develop a setup for muscle-sound assessment, which could be reliably applied in any local setting. A group of healthy subjects were assessed during standing, stair climbing, walking, and running. Piezoelectric microphones were applied to the skin using contact gel. A digital sound recorder enabled sampling speeds of around 96,000 Hz. Surface electromyography was measured in parallel as a comparison. The recorded signals were assessed and described in terms of signal frequency (Hz) and peak-to-peak amplitude (mV) using Chart software. Bioimpedance of the involved muscles was measured. Sound recording was shown to be an easy noninvasive method for assessment of muscle function during movement with the possibility of being applied in most clinical, sports, and home settings. Muscle sound gives a representation of the work of each muscle group during a complex movement, illustrated here by a step test, which revealed both concentric and eccentric activity.

Plate I, made of Y-X lithium niobate, contained two interdigital transducers that excited and received an acoustic wave with shear-horizontal polarization. Piezoelectric plate II, made of lithium niobate, was placed above and between the transducers, separated by a fixed gap. For its certain orientation, the amplitude-frequency characteristic showed sharply defined resonant attenuation peaks, which were situated at an equidistant separation from each other. The depth of the peaks was observed to decrease with a wider gap between the plates. It has been stated that these peaks are associated with the resonant reflections of a slot acoustic wave across the width of plate II. Experimentally determined phase velocities and electromechanical coupling coefficient for the slot wave in the structure under study are in a good agreement with theoretical values for various crystallographic orientations of plate II. A comparison between the experimental and theoretical results has allowed us to state two conditions for the slot wave to exist.

Nevertheless, the detection of these high-frequency components, including the third, fourth, and fifth harmonics, remains challenging because of the lack of transducer sensitivity and bandwidth. In this context, we propose a new design of imaging transducer based on a simple fabrication process for high-frequency nonlinear imaging. The transducer is composed of two elements: the outer low-frequency (LF) element was centered at 4 MHz and used in transmit mode, whereas the inner high-frequency (HF) element centered at 14 MHz was used in receive mode. The center element was pad-printed using a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) paste. The outer element was molded using a commercial PZT, and curved porous unpoled PZT was used as backing. Each piezoelectric element was characterized to determine the electromechanical performance with thickness coupling factor around 45%. After the assembly of the two transducer elements, hydrophone measurements (electroacoustic responses and radiation patterns) were carried out and demonstrated a large bandwidth (70% at -3 dB) of the HF transducer. Finally, the transducer was evaluated for contrast agent imaging using contrast agent microbubbles. The results showed that harmonic components (up to the sixth harmonic) of the microbubbles were successfully detected.

A variety of different techniques are used in patterning the active piezoelectric material, attaching backing material to the transducer, and assembling an electronic interconnection board for transmission and reception from the array. To establish the feasibility of the process flow, a hybrid test ultrasound array transducer consisting of a 2-D array having an 8 \u00d7 8 element pattern and a 5-element annular array was designed, fabricated, and assessed. The arrays are designed for a center frequency of ~60 MHz. The 2-D array elements are 105 \u00d7 105 \u03bcm in size with 5-\u03bcm kerfs between elements. The annular array surrounds the square 2-D array and provides the option of transmitting from the annular array and receiving with the 2-D array.

This paper investigates the theory, feasibility, and optimization of such a capacitively coupled transducer system (CCTS) in the context of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) applications. The noncontact interface relies on an electric field formed between four metal plates-two plates are physically connected to the electrodes of a transducer, the other two are in a separate probing unit connected to the transmit/receive channel of the instrumentation. The complete system is modeled as an electric network with the measured impedance of a bonded piezoelectric ceramic disc representing a transducer attached to an arbitrary solid substrate. A transmission line model is developed which is a function of the physical parameters of the capacitively coupled system, such as the permittivity of the material between the plates, the size of the metal plates, and their relative positions. This model provides immediate prediction of electric input impedance, pulse-echo response, and the effect of plate misalignment. The model has been validated experimentally and has enabled optimization of the various parameters. It is shown that placing a tuning inductor and series resistor on the transmitting side of the circuit can significantly improve the system performance in terms of the signal-to-crosstalk ratio.

{"title": "AMPK activation regulates neuronal structure in developing hippocampal neurons.", "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a cellular and whole organism energy sensor to regulate ATP-consuming (anabolic) and ATP-generating (catabolic) pathways. The heterotrimeric AMPK complex consists of a catalytic \u03b1-subunit, regulatory \u03b2-subunit, and an AMP/ATP-binding \u03b3-subunit. Several alternate isoforms exist for each subunit (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b31, \u03b32 and \u03b33). However, little is known of the expression pattern or function of the individual catalytic complexes in regulating neuronal structure. In this study, we examined the role of AMPK subunits in differentiating hippocampal neurons. We found that during development, the expression of AMPK subunits increase and that activation of AMPK by energetic stress inhibits neuronal development at multiple stages, not only during axon outgrowth, but also during dendrite growth and arborization. The presence of a single functional AMPK catalytic complex was sufficient to mediate these inhibitory effects of energetic stress. Activation of AMPK mediates these effects by suppressing both the mTOR and Akt signaling pathways. These findings demonstrate that the energy-sensing AMPK pathway regulates neuronal structure in distinct regions of developing neurons at multiple stages of development.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-12-04", "authors": ["SRamamurthy", "EChang", "YCao", "JZhu", "G VRonnett"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.11.048"}

Vitexin and isovitexin, naturally occurring C-glycosylated derivatives of apigenin, have been known to possess potent anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer's disease (anti-AD), and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-diabetic, anti-AD, and anti-inflammatory potential of apigenin and its two C-glycosylated derivatives, vitexin and isovitexin by in vitro assays including rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant aldose reductase (HRAR), advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), \u03b2-site amyloid precursor (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Among them, isovitexin was found as the most potent inhibitor against RLAR, HRAR, AGE, AChE, and BChE while vitexin showed the most potent PTP1B inhibitory activity. Despite the relatively weak anti-diabetic and anti-AD potentials, apigenin showed powerful antiinflammatory activity by inhibiting NO production and iNOS and COX-2 expression while vitexin and isovitexin were inactive.

Based on the above outcomes, an EMAT is developed to measure the bolt axial stress without loosening the bolt, which is required in the conventional EMAT test method. The experimental results from the measurement of the bolt tension show that the shear and the mode-converted longitudinal waves can be received successfully, and the ratio of the times of flight of the shear and the mode-converted longitudinal waves is linearly proportional to the bolt axial tension.

{"title": "Mechanical-plowing-based high-speed patterning on hard material via advanced-control and ultrasonic probe vibration.", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a high-speed direct pattern fabrication on hard materials (e.g., a tungsten-coated quartz substrate) via mechanical plowing. Compared to other probe-based nanolithography techniques based on chemical- and/or physical-reactions (e.g., the Dip-pen technique), mechanical plowing is meritorious for its low cost, ease of process control, and capability of working with a wide variety of materials beyond conductive and/or soft materials. However, direct patterning on hard material faces two daunting challenges. First, the patterning throughput is ultimately hindered by the \"writing\" (plowing) speed, which, in turn, is limited by the adverse effects that can be excited/induced during high-speed, and/or large-range plowing, including the vibrational dynamics of the actuation system (the piezoelectric actuator, the cantilever, and the mechanical fixture connecting the cantilever to the actuator), the dynamic cross-axis coupling between different axes of motion, and the hysteresis and the drift effects related to the piezoelectric actuators. Secondly, it is very challenging to directly pattern on ultra-hard materials via plowing. Even with a diamond probe, the line depth of the pattern via continuous plowing on ultra-hard materials such as tungsten, is still rather small (<0.5 nm), particularly when the \"writing\" speed becomes high. To overcome these two challenges, we propose to utilize a novel iterative learning control technique to achieve precision tracking of the desired pattern during high-speed, large-range plowing, and introduce ultrasonic vibration of the probe in the normal (vertical) direction during the plowing process to enable direct patterning on ultra hard materials. The proposed approach was implemented to directly fabricate patterns on a mask with tungsten coating and quartz substrate. The experimental results demonstrated that a large-size pattern of four grooves (20 \u03bcm in length with 300 nm spacing between lines) can be fabricated at a high speed of ~5 mm/s, with the line width and the line depth at ~95 nm and 2 nm, respectively.

We conducted this study to gain insight on PON1 fate and activation during short-term HDL remodeling ex vivo.\nSerum from 8 healthy volunteers was either frozen at -80\u00b0C (time 0) or incubated under sterile conditions for up to 48h at 37\u00b0C or at 4\u00b0C. Aliquots were taken at 3, 6, 9, 24 and 48 h and immediately frozen at -80\u00b0C. PON1 activities were measured, as well as PON1 and apolipoprotein distributions in HDL subclasses by gradient gel electrophoresis.\nThe first novel finding in our study is the evidence provided for a significant activation of both lactonase and arylesterase activities of PON1 that ensues in a very short time frame of incubation of serum ex vivo at 37\u00b0C. All subjects studied displayed these changes, the activation was apparent in <3h, peaked at 6h and amounted to >20%. This is associated with a temperature and time-dependent redistribution of PON1 activity in HDL subclasses, with an increase in activity in both very large HDL2 and small HDL3 in the first phase (3-9h), followed by a progressive transfer of PON1 to very large HDL2 as the particles mature. These changes are paralleled by the appearance of weak, but apparent PON1 activity at subspecies that correspond to sdLDL. During the first phase of PON1 activation and shifts, a parallel shift of apoE can be evidenced: at 3-9h, apoE increases in sdLDL, after that time it is lost from HDL and also from sdLDL and stays in VLDL at the origin of the run. ApoA-I shifts towards larger particles, which parallels the change in PON1. As HDL matures there is a progressive shift of apoA-II towards larger HDL. Low levels of apoA-IV at the initiation of the incubation are followed by time dependent quick disappearance of apoA-IV in HDL which parallels the changes in PON1, apoE and A-II.\nShort, ex vivo incubation of serum leads to quick activation of PON1 associated with transfers to HDL3c, large HDL and sdLDL. The process is blocked by CETP and LCAT inhibitors. The data suggest that HDL maturation optimizes PON1 activity. These findings may be of interest for future studies aimed at modulating PON-1 activity for its cardioprotective effects and suggest a new mechanism whereby CETP inhibitors failed in clinical trials.", "journal": "Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["AlejandroGugliucci"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2013.11.021"}

Therefore, ridge-splitting techniques have been suggested to enlarge alveolar crests. The aim of this cohort study was to report techniques and radiographic outcomes of implants placed simultaneously with a piezoelectric alveolar ridge-splitting technique (RST). Peri-implant bone-level changes (\u0394IBL) of implants placed with (study group, SG) or without RST (control group, CG) were compared.\nTwo cohorts (seven patients in each) were matched regarding implant type, position, and number; superstructure type; age; and gender and received 17 implants each. Crestal implant bone level (IBL) was measured at surgery (T0), loading (T1), and 1 year (T2) and 2 years after loading (T3). For all implants, \u0394IBL values were determined from radiographs. Differences in \u0394IBL between SG and CG were analyzed statistically (Mann-Whitney U test). Bone width was assessed intraoperatively, and vertical bone mapping was performed at T0, T1, and T3.\nAfter a mean observation period of 27.4 months after surgery, the implant survival rate was 100%. Mean \u0394IBL was -1.68 \u00b1 0.90 mm for SG and -1.04 \u00b1 0.78 mm for CG (P = .022). Increased \u0394IBL in SG versus CG occurred mainly until T2. Between T2 and T3, \u0394IBL was limited (-0.11 \u00b1 1.20 mm for SG and -0.05 \u00b1 0.16 mm for CG; P = .546). Median bone width increased intraoperatively by 4.7 mm.\nWithin the limitations of this study, it can be suggested that RST is a well-functioning one-stage alternative to extended grafting procedures if the ridge shows adequate height. \u0394IBL values indicated that implants with RST may fulfill accepted implant success criteria.

{"title": "Unsteady penetration of a target by a liquid jet.", "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that ceramic armor experiences an unsteady penetration response: an impacting projectile may erode on the surface of a ceramic target without substantial penetration for a significant amount of time and then suddenly start to penetrate the target. Although known for more than four decades, this phenomenon, commonly referred to as dwell, remains largely unexplained. Here, we use scaled analog experiments with a low-speed water jet and a soft, translucent target material to investigate dwell. The transient target response, in terms of depth of penetration and impact force, is captured using a high-speed camera in combination with a piezoelectric force sensor. We observe the phenomenon of dwell using a soft (noncracking) target material. The results show that the penetration rate increases when the flow of the impacting water jet is reversed due to the deformation of the jet-target interface--this reversal is also associated with an increase in the force exerted by the jet on the target. Creep penetration experiments with a constant indentation force did not show an increase in the penetration rate, confirming that flow reversal is the cause of the unsteady penetration rate. Our results suggest that dwell can occur in a ductile noncracking target due to flow reversal. This phenomenon of flow reversal is rather widespread and present in a wide range of impact situations, including water-jet cutting, needleless injection, and deposit removal via a fluid jet.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["TobiasUth", "Vikram SDeshpande"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1315130110"}

Lead zirconate titanate (PZT), in particular, has attracted significant attention, owing to its superior electromechanical conversion performance. Yet, the ability to synthesize crystalline PZT nanowires with well-controlled properties remains a challenge. Applications of common nanosynthesis methods to PZT are hampered by issues such as slow kinetics, lack of suitable catalysts, and harsh reaction conditions. Here we report a versatile biomimetic method, in which biotemplates are used to define PZT nanostructures, allowing for rational control over composition and crystallinity. Specifically, stoichiometric PZT nanowires were synthesized using both polysaccharide (alginate) and bacteriophage templates. The wires possessed measured piezoelectric constants of up to 132 pm/V after poling, among the highest reported for PZT nanomaterials. Further, integrated devices can generate up to 0.820 \u03bcW/cm(2) of power.

{"title": "Mitochondrial fission induced by platelet-derived growth factor regulates vascular smooth muscle cell bioenergetics and cell proliferation.", "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) develop a highly proliferative and synthetic phenotype in arterial diseases. Because such phenotypic changes are likely integrated with the energetic state of the cell, we hypothesized that changes in cellular metabolism regulate VSMC plasticity. VSMCs were exposed to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) and changes in mitochondrial morphology, proliferation, contractile protein expression, and mitochondrial metabolism were examined. Exposure of VSMCs to PDGF resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation and a 50% decrease in the abundance of mitofusin 2. Synthetic VSMCs demonstrated a 20% decrease in glucose oxidation, which was accompanied by an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Results of mitochondrial function assays in permeabilized cells showed few changes due to PDGF treatment in mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and coupling. Treatment of VSMCs with Mdivi-1-an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission-inhibited PDGF-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by 50% and abolished increases in cell proliferation; however, it failed to prevent PDGF-mediated activation of autophagy and removal of contractile proteins. In addition, treatment with Mdivi-1 reversed changes in fatty acid and glucose oxidation associated with the synthetic phenotype. These results suggest that changes in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics underlie the hyperproliferative features of the synthetic VSMC phenotype, but do not affect the degradation of contractile proteins.

The LSAW immunosensor was first immobilized with protein A from Staphylococcus aureus and monoclonal anti-CsA antibody on the gold electrode surface of 100 MHz LiTaO3 piezoelectric crystals, which then captured the CsA. The CsA increased the mass loading of LSAW immunosensor and leaded to phase shifts of LSAW. Consequently, under optimal conditions, the designed LSAW immunosensor exhibited a detection limit of 0.89 ng/mL, quantification limit of 2.96 ng/mL, and wide dynamic linear range from 1 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL for CsA detection. Application of the LSAW immunosensor array to clinical sample revealed that consistency and comparability between LSAW immunosensor and the enzyme multiplied immunoassay method were good. Moreover, the immunosensor could be regenerated for ten times without appreciable loss of activity. Therefore, the self-designed LSAW immunosensor array provided a rapid, accurate, label-free, easy handling, and dynamic real-time method for the detection of immunosuppressive drugs in clinical laboratory.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["KaiChang", "FengWang", "YiDing", "FengPan", "FakeLi", "ShuangrongJia", "WeipingLu", "ShaoliDeng", "JianfengShi", "MingChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.066"}

Mutations in CLN5 cause a variant late-infantile human disease and some cases of juvenile and adult clinical disease. NCLs also occur in animals, and a flock of New Zealand Borderdale sheep with a CLN5 splice-site mutation has been developed for model studies. Dissociated mixed neural cells from CLN5-deficient foetal sheep brains contained no obvious storage bodies at plating but these accumulated rapidly in culture, mainly in microglial cells and also in neurons and astrocytes. Accumulation was very obvious after a week, as monitored by fluorescent microscopy and immunostaining for subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase. Photography at intervals revealed the dynamic nature of the cultures and a flow of storage bodies between cells, specifically the phagocytosis of storage-body containing cells by microglia and incorporation of the storage bodies into the host cells. No storage was observed in cultured control cells. Transduction of cell cultures with a lentiviral vector expressing a C-terminal Myc tagged CLN5 resulted in secretion of post-translationally glycosylated and processed CLN5. Transduction of CLN5-deficient cultures with this construct rapidly reversed storage body accumulation, to less than half in only six days.

Identifying and understanding the hemorrhagic components of its venom is therefore particularly important in optimizing medical treatment of patients. We describe a novel high molecular mass hemorrhagin, VaH4. The isolated molecule is a covalent dimer of two homologous subunits, VaH4-A and VaH4-B. Complete structural characterization of A and partial characterization of B revealed that both belong to the P-III class of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), comprising a metalloproteinase, a disintegrin-like domain and a cysteine-rich domain. However, neither VaH4-A nor VaH4-B possess the Cys174 involved in the inter-subunit disulphide bond of P-III SVMPs. A three-dimensional model of the VaH4 dimer suggests that Cys132 serves this function. This implies that dimers in the P-III class of SVMPs can be formed either between their Cys132 or Cys174 residues. The proteolytic activity and stability of VaH4 depend on Zn\u00b2\u207a and Ca\u00b2\u207a ions and the presence of glycosaminoglycans, which indicates physiological interaction of VaH4 with the latter element of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular mass of VaH4, determined by MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry, is 110.2 kDa. N-deglycosylation reduced the mass of each monomer by 8.7 kDa. The two possible N-glycosylation sites in VaH4-A are located at completely different positions from those in homodimeric P-IIIc VaH3 from the same venom, however, without any evident functional implications. The hemorrhagic activity of this slightly acidic SVMP is ascribed to its hydrolysis of components of the ECM, particularly fibronectin and nidogen, and of some blood coagulation proteins, in particular the \u03b1-chain of fibrinogen.

{"title": "Assessing the relationship between the inter-rod coupling and the efficiency of piezocomposite high-intensity focused ultrasound transducers.", "abstract": "The electroacoustic conversion efficiency of the ultrasonic transducer is a critical performance index for high-power applications. The material properties, volume fraction (VF) and aspect ratio (AR) are typically regarded as the design parameters of the piezocomposite transducer. We hypothesized that the spacing between piezoelectric rods was also a dominant factor. Therefore, the inter-rod coupling effects on the efficiency of 1-3 piezocomposite ultrasonic transducers were investigated in this study. The efficiencies of six flat and three curved 1.0 MHz PZT4 epoxy composite transducers with different geometric parameters were measured. Finite element transient analyses of the inter-rod electrical-mechanical coupling in the composites were carried out to explain the measured results. The experimental results showed that for 0.47 AR, the 79% VF transducers had lower efficiency than the 64% VF and 53% VF transducers. For 0.19 AR, the efficiency of the 59% VF transducer was not greater than the efficiency of the 39% VF transducer. Numerical analyses demonstrated that the positive peak voltage induced by the coupling of the side rods was more than twice the level induced by the coupling of the diagonal rods for any spacing. The diagonal coupling voltage peak did not change for spacings larger than 0.2 mm. Moreover, for spacings of 0.05 and 0.1 mm, the inter-rod coupling caused 24% and 20% waveform shifts of the driving voltage, respectively, while the 0.2 mm spacing coupling caused a 14% reduction in the amplitude of the driving voltage. As a result, the asymmetry of the driving voltage degraded the efficiency of the composite transducers and became more severe when the spacing was decreased. We concluded that the efficiency loss induced by inter-rod coupling as a function of spacing should be considered when designing piezocomposite transducers.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["Gin-ShinChen", "Chia-ChingPan", "Yu-LiLin", "Jung-SungCheng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.10.003"}

For the further development of PNGs, structural optimization is essential, but the structural analysis progress in this area has been scant. In the present study, we proposed a PNG with a well-ordered nanoshell array structure. The nanoshell structure has been considered as an effective core nanostructure for PNGs due to its effective stress confinement effect but has not been experimentally introduced thus far due to the challenging fabrication method required. To produce a controllable nanoshell structure, a top-down silicon nanofabrication technique which involves advanced spacer lithography is introduced. A comprehensive design strategy to enhance the piezoelectric performance is proposed in terms of the nanoshell diameter and shell-to-shell space. Both simulated and measured data confirm that an extremely high density of a structure is not always the best answer to maximize the performance. The highest amount of power can be achieved when the shell diameter and shell-to-shell space are within their proper ranges.

This systematic review of all experimental and clinical studies is aimed at investigating whether titanized meshes confer advantages over other synthetic meshes in hernia surgery.\nA search of the medical literature from 2002 to 2012, as indexed by Medline, was performed, using the PubMed search engine (http://www.pubmed.gov). The search terms were: hernia mesh, titanium coating, lightweight mesh, TiMesh, mesh complications. All papers were graded according to the Oxford hierarchy of evidence.\nPatients operated on with the Lichtenstein technique performed using the lightweight titanium-coated mesh have a shorter convalescence than those with the heavy-weight mesh Prolene. For inguinal hernias operated on with the TAPP technique and using a lightweight titanium-coated mesh in comparison to a heavy-weight Prolene mesh, the early postoperative convalescence seems to improve. Titanized meshes do exhibit a negative effect on sperm motility 1 year after a TEP operation, but not after 3 years. The laparoscopic IPOM technique with a titanium-coated polypropylene mesh was associated with less postoperative pain in the short term, lower analgesic consumption and a quicker return to everyday activities compared with the Parietex composite mesh.\nIn clinical studies, the titanium-coated polypropylene mesh shows in inguinal hernia repair certain benefits compared with the use of older heavy-weight meshes.", "journal": "Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery", "date": "2013-11-21", "authors": ["FK\u00f6ckerling", "CSchug-Pass"], "doi": "10.1007/s10029-013-1187-3\n10.1308/003588410X12664192076296\n10.1055/s-0031-1283761\n10.1159/000079917\n10.1016/j.suc.2007.11.002\n10.1007/s00423-008-0453-9\n10.1007/s00423-009-0466-z\n10.1007/s00464-012-2339-8\n10.1007/s00464-009-0509-0\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.08.015\n10.1007/s10029-008-0362-4\n10.1007/s10029-004-0292-8\n10.1007/s10029-009-0621-z\n10.1007/s00464-005-0706-4\n10.1007/s10029-007-0327-z\n10.1002/bjs.6446\n10.1007/s00423-006-0080-2\n10.1007/s00464-007-9243-7\n10.1007/s00464-003-8113-1\n10.1007/s00464-004-8277-3\n10.1007/s00464-008-9876-1\n10.7326/0003-4819-152-11-201006010-00232\n10.1002/bjs.6325\n10.1007/s00268-010-0850-4\n10.1007/s00268-011-1148-x\n10.1007/s00464-011-1862-3\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181e8fac5\n10.1007/s00268-005-0242-3\n10.1007/s10029-008-0365-1"}

Such signaling is often associated with territoriality and social interactions. The goal in this study was to explore the use of substrate vibration by subsocial insects of the little-studied order Embioptera (also known as Embiidina). Antipaluria urichi (Saussure) (Embioptera: Clothodidae) from Trinidad and Tobago, a large embiopteran, exhibits maternal care and facultatively colonial behavior. Previous observations suggested that they were aggressive while guarding eggs but gregarious when not. Egg-guarders in particular have been observed shaking and lunging their bodies, but to date these putative signals have not been recorded nor were their contexts known. Staged interactions were conducted in the laboratory using residents that had established silk domiciles enveloping piezo-electric film used to detect vibrations. Predictions from two competing hypotheses, the maternal territoriality hypothesis and the group cohesion hypothesis, were erected to explain the occurrence of signaling. Experiments pitted pre-reproductive and egg-guarding residents against female and male intruders, representing social partners that ranged from potentially threatening to innocuous or even helpful. Behavioral acts were identified and scored along with associated substrate vibrations, which were measured for associated body movements, duration, and frequency spectra. Signals, sorted by the distinct actions used to generate them, were lunge, shake, push up, and snapback. Egg-guarding females produced most signals in response to female intruders, a result that supported the maternal territoriality hypothesis. Female intruders generally responded to such signaling by moving away from egg-guarding residents. In contrast, pre-reproductive residents did not signal much, and intruders settled beside them. Theme software was used to analyze the behavioral event recordings to seek patterns over time and their association with signals. Long patterns of behavioral acts were associated with shakes, lunges, and push-ups, indicating that interactions were occurring between the residents and intruders as would be expected when communication occurs. The value of Theme software, as well as the relationship between signaling by A. urichi and the risks and benefits of coloniality, are discussed.", "journal": "Journal of insect science (Online)", "date": "2013-11-15", "authors": ["Khaaliq ADejan", "John MFresquez", "Annika MMeyer", "Janice SEdgerly"], "doi": "10.1673/031.013.8201"}

The CMOS camera has high photosensitivity and superior SNR. It acquires images of 128\u00d7120 pixels at a frame rate of up to 10,000 frames per second (fps) under the white light illumination from a standard 100 W halogen lamp. The real-time image stream is downloaded from the camera directly to the FPGA, wherein a 3D particle-tracking algorithm is implemented to calculate the 3D positions of the target particle in real time. Two important objectives, i.e., real-time estimation of the 3D position matches the maximum frame rate of the camera and the timing of the output data stream of the system is precisely controlled, are achieved.

{"title": "Selective vulnerability of hippocampal sub-fields to oxygen-glucose deprivation is a function of animal age.", "abstract": "For more than a century, the hippocampal sub-fields have been recognized as being differentially vulnerable to injury. While the cause remains unknown, the explanations generally considered have involved either vascular differences, or innate variability among cells. To examine the latter possibility, we prepared acute hippocampal slices from Sprague-Dawley rats, applied a brief period of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD; an in vitro model of ischemia), and assessed the viability of dissected sub-fields (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus) by measuring mitochondrial 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) metabolism. In slices from young animals (15 weeks of age), post-OGD TTC metabolism was significantly reduced in the CA sub-fields relative to the dentate gyrus. Since previous studies found increasing age may worsen ischemic injury, we completed the same experiment using tissue from animals at 52 weeks of age, and found no differences in TTC metabolism across sub-fields. Given the established role of glutamate receptors in ischemic cell death, we examined two key subunit proteins (GluN1, found in all NMDA receptors, and GluA2, found in most AMPA receptors) across sub-fields and age to determine whether their expression complemented our viability data. We found that, relative to the CA1, the DG displayed greater GluN1 expression and lower GluA2 expression in both young and old animals. Our results confirm that regional vulnerability can be shown in a slice model, that the property is not intransigent, and that these features are likely not attributable to the expression pattern of key glutamate receptor subunits, but another molecular variable that changes over the lifespan.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2013-11-12", "authors": ["Crystal CLalonde", "John GMielke"], "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2013.10.056"}

Morphological studies of the cathodes before and after the electrochemical tests were performed by using AFM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cathodes that contained polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and were prepared by spray-coating exhibited a superior stability of the morphology and the electric network associated with the capacity and cycling stability of these batteries.

Netrin-1, an axonal guidance cue, can also promote axonal guidance growth, but the molecular mechanism of axonal guidance growth under indirect electric stimulation is still unknown. We investigated the molecular mechanism of axonal guidance growth under piezoelectric ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) stimulation in the primary cultured cortical neurons. PZT induced marked axonal elongation. Moreover, PZT activated the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by increasing the frequency and amplitude of EPSCs of the cortical neurons in patch clamp assay. PZT downregulated the expression of Netrin-1 and its receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC). Rho GTPase signaling is involved in interactions of Netrin-1 and DCC. PZT activated RhoA. Dramatic decrease of Cdc42 and Rac1 was also observed after PZT treatment. RhoA inhibitor Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (C3-Exo) prevented the PZT-induced downregulation of Netrin-1 and DCC. We suggest that PZT can promote axonal guidance growth by downregulation of Netrin-1 and DCC to mediate axonal repulsive responses via the Rho GTPase signaling pathway.

A facile electrodeposition was employed to modify the sensor surface with Au nanoparticles, which increased the surface area and enhanced the binding capacity of the immobilized probes. Thiol-labeled long chain hydrocarbon with bisphenol A (BPA) as head group was synthesized and self-assembled on the Au nanoparticle surface as the sensing probes, which showed a linear response upon the binding of estrogen receptor (ER-\u03b1) ranging from 1 to 30 nM. Detection of estrone, 17\u03b2-estradiol and BPA was achieved by integrating a competitive binding assay with the piezoelectric sensor. In this detection scheme, different concentrations of EDCs were incubated with 30 nM of ER-\u03b1, and the un-bounded ER-\u03b1 in the solution was captured by the probes immobilized on the ceramic resonator, which resulted in the frequency changes for different EDCs. The biosensor assay exhibited a linear response to EDCs with a low detection limit of 2.4-2.9 nM (S/N=3), and required only a small volume of sample (1.5 \u00b5l) with the assay time of 2h.

{"title": "Control of soft machines using actuators operated by a Braille display.", "abstract": "One strategy for actuating soft machines (e.g., tentacles, grippers, and simple walkers) uses pneumatic inflation of networks of small channels in an elastomeric material. Although the management of a few pneumatic inputs and valves to control pressurized gas is straightforward, the fabrication and operation of manifolds containing many (>50) independent valves is an unsolved problem. Complex pneumatic manifolds-often built for a single purpose-are not easily reconfigured to accommodate the specific inputs (i.e., multiplexing of many fluids, ranges of pressures, and changes in flow rates) required by pneumatic systems. This paper describes a pneumatic manifold comprising a computer-controlled Braille display and a micropneumatic device. The Braille display provides a compact array of 64 piezoelectric actuators that actively close and open elastomeric valves of a micropneumatic device to route pressurized gas within the manifold. The positioning and geometries of the valves and channels in the micropneumatic device dictate the functionality of the pneumatic manifold, and the use of multi-layer soft lithography permits the fabrication of networks in a wide range of configurations with many possible functions. Simply exchanging micropneumatic devices of different designs enables rapid reconfiguration of the pneumatic manifold.

Consequently, additional CO2 gas is absorbed by amine absorbents. This study examines highly porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/siloxane nanofibrous layers that are modified with hydrophobic fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) functional groups and successfully coated onto a macroporous Al2 O3 membrane. The performance of these materials in a membrane contactor system for CO2 absorption is also investigated. Compared with pristine PVDF nanofibrous membranes, the PVDF/siloxane nanofibrous membranes exhibit greater solvent resistance and mechanical strength, making them more suitable for use in CO2 capture by the membrane contactor. The PVDF/siloxane nanofibrous layer in highly porous FAS-modified membranes can prevent the wetting of the membrane by the amine absorbent; this extends the periods of continuous CO2 absorption and results in a high CO2 absorption flux with a minimum of 500 % enhancement over that of the uncoated membranes. This study suggests the potential use of an FAS-modified PVDF/siloxane nanofibrous membrane in a membrane contactor system for CO2 absorption.

We studied the influence of the finite solubility of silica at high pH on the mechanical properties of the gel with classical and piezo-rheometers. Direct preparation of the gel sample in the rheometer cell avoided any pre-shear of the gel structure during the filling of the rheometer. The storage modulus of the gel grew logarithmically with time with two distinct growth laws. The system passes the gel point very quickly but still shows relaxation at low frequency, typically below 6 rad/s. We attribute this as a sign of structural rearrangements due to the finite solubility of silica at high pH. The reaction equilibrium between bond formation and dissolution maintains a relatively large bond dissolution rate, which leads to a finite life time of the bonds and behavior similar to physical gels. This interpretation is also compatible with the logarithmic time dependence of the storage modulus. The frequency dependence was more pronounced for lower water concentrations, higher temperatures and shorter reaction times. With two relaxation models (the modified Cole-Cole model and the empirical Baumgaertel-Schausberger-Winter model) we deduced characteristic times from the experimental data.

The core body of a non-invasive energy harvester is a linear Halbach array, which is mounted on the free end of a piezoelectric cantilever beam. The Halbach array augments the magnetic flux density on the side of the array where the power line is placed and significantly lowers the magnetic field on the other side. Consequently, the magnetic coupling strength is enhanced and more alternating magnetic field energy from the current-carrying power line is converted into electrical energy. An analytical model is developed and the theoretical results verify the experimental results. A power of 566 \u03bcW across a 196 k\u03a9 resistor is generated from a single wire, and a power of 897 \u03bcW across a 212 k\u03a9 resistor is produced from a two-wire power cord carrying opposite currents at 10 A. The harvesters employing Halbach arrays for a single wire and a two-wire power cord, respectively, exhibit 3.9 and 3.2 times higher power densities than those of the harvesters employing conventional layouts of magnets.

Under optimal settings, the measurement system is shown to theoretically achieve sub-angstrom measurement resolution over a bandwidth in excess of 1 kHz and negligible cross-sensitivity to linear motion. Subsequently, the proposed technique is experimentally demonstrated by measuring the in-plane motion of a piezo flexure stage and a scanning probe microcantilever. For the former case, reflective spherical balls of different radii are employed to measure the in-plane motion and the measured sensitivities are shown to agree with theoretical values, on average, to within 8.3%.

The chemical structure of FA-PEG-COL conjugate was characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS, FT-IR and (1)H NMR. The average size of siRNA/FA-PEG-COL nanoparticles was approximately 200 nm, and the surface charge was +8.4 mV compared to +30.5 mV with siRNA/COL nanoparticles. FA-PEG-COL nanoparticles demonstrated superior compatibility with erythrocytes in terms of degree of aggregation and haemolytic activity and also effects on cell viability was lower when compared with COL nanoparticles. FA grafting significantly facilitated the uptake of nanoparticles via receptor mediated endocytosis as demonstrated by flow cytometry. The in vitro transfection and gene knockdown efficiency of HIF-1\u03b1 were superior to COL nanoparticles (76-62%, respectively) and was comparable to Lipofectamine 2000 (79%) as demonstrated by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Gene knockdown at the molecular level translated into effective inhibition of proliferation in vitro. Accumulation efficiency of FA-PEG-COL nanoparticles was investigated in BALB/c mice bearing OVK18 #2 tumor xenograft using in vivo imaging. The active targeting FA-PEG-COL nanoparticles showed significantly greater accumulation than the passive targeting COL nanoparticles.

To solve this controversy, we propose a methodology based on DFT calculations of the response of nanostructures to external deformations that allows us to distinguish between the different (bulk and surface) contributions: we apply this scheme to evaluate the piezoelectric properties of ZnO [0001] nanowires, with a diameter up to 2.3\u00a0nm. Our results reveal that, while surface and confinement effects are negligible, effective strain energies, and thus the nanowire mechanical response, are dependent on size.

{"title": "Mechanisms of MS2 bacteriophage removal by fouled ultrafiltration membrane subjected to different cleaning methods.", "abstract": "An ultrafiltration unit with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane of 40 nm nominal pore size was used to study bacteriophage MS2 removal under different membrane conditions: pristine membrane, membrane fouled by soluble microbial product (SMP) extracted from membrane bioreactor (MBR) feedwater, backwashed membrane, and chemically cleaned membrane. The order of MS2 removal by these membranes was as follows: fouled membrane > backwashed membrane > chemically cleaned membrane \u2248 pristine membrane. A linear correlation between membrane relative permeability and MS2 removal was found. Mass balance analysis showed a high percentage of MS2 in the concentrate for the fouled membrane as compared with the pristine membrane. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) results showed faster kinetics of MS2 adhesion to the pristine membrane than to the SMP-fouled membrane. In agreement with QCM results, an attractive force between MS2 and the pristine membrane was detected using an atomic force microscope (AFM), whereas a repulsive force was detected for the interaction between MS2 and the fouled membrane. The presence of SMP on the membrane surface led to higher rejection of MS2 due to both pore blocking and repulsion between MS2 and the SMP layer. Chemical cleaning removed most of the SMP foulant and as a result led to a lower MS2 removal.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2013-11-02", "authors": ["RuiqingLu", "DanielMosiman", "Thanh HNguyen"], "doi": "10.1021/es403426t"}

{"title": "Ligand modulation of a dinuclear platinum compound leads to mechanistic differences in cell cycle progression and arrest.", "abstract": "Despite similar structures and DNA binding profiles, two recently synthesized dinuclear platinum compounds are shown to elicit highly divergent effects on cell cycle progression. In colorectal HCT116 cells, BBR3610 shows a classical G2/M arrest with initial accumulation in S phase, but the derivative compound BBR3610-DACH, formed by introduction of the 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) as carrier ligand, results in severe G1/S as well as G2/M phase arrest, with nearly complete S phase depletion. The origin of this unique effect was studied. Cellular interstrand crosslinking as assayed by comet analysis was similar for both compounds, confirming previous in vitro results obtained on plasmid DNA. Immunoblotting revealed a stabilization of p53 and concomitant transient increases in p21 and p27 proteins after treatment with BBR3610-DACH. Cell viability assays and cytometric analysis of p53 and p21 null cells indicated that BBR3610-DACH-induced cell cycle arrest was p21-dependent and partially p53-dependent. However, an increase in the levels of cyclin E was observed with steady state levels of CDK2 and Cdc25A, suggesting that the G1 block occurs downstream of CDK/cyclin complex formation. The G2/M block was corroborated with decreased levels of cyclin A and cyclin B1. Surprisingly, BBR3610-DACH-induced G1 block was independent of ATM and ATR. Finally, both compounds induced apoptosis, with BBR3610-DACH showing a robust PARP-1 cleavage that was not associated with caspase-3/7 cleavage.

{"title": "Flexible polyester cellulose paper supercapacitor with a gel electrolyte.", "abstract": "A low-cost polyester cellulose paper has been used as a substrate for a flexible supercapacitor device that contains aqueous carbon nanotube ink as the electrodes and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based gel as the electrolyte. Gel electrolytes have attracted much interest due to their solvent-holding capacity and good film-forming capability. The electrodes are characterized for their conductivity and morphology. Because of its high conductivity, the conductive paper is studied in supercapacitor applications as active electrodes and as separators after coating with polyvinylidene fluoride. Carbon nanotubes deposited on porous paper are more accessible to ions in the electrolyte than those on flat substrates, which results in higher power density. A simple fabrication process is achieved and paper supercapacitors are tested for their performance in both aqueous and PVA gel electrolytes by using galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetry methods. A high specific capacitance of 270 F\u2009g(-1) and an energy density value of 37 W\u2009h\u2009kg(-1) are achieved for devices with PVA gel electrolytes. Furthermore, this device can maintain excellent specific capacitance even under high currents. This is also confirmed by another counter experiment with aqueous sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. The cycle life, one of the most critical parameters in supercapacitor operations, is found to be excellent (6000 cycles) and less than 0.5\u2009% capacitance loss is observed. Moreover, the supercapacitor device is flexible and even after twisting does not show any cracks or evidence of breakage, and shows almost the same specific capacitance of 267 F\u2009g(-1) and energy density of 37 W\u2009h\u2009kg(-1) .

Specifically, following the cellular uptake of the piezoelectric nanotubes, cultures of primary human osteoblasts (hOBs) were irradiated with low frequency ultrasound (US), as a simple method to apply a mechanical input to the cells loaded with BNNTs. This in vitro study was aimed at investigating the main interactions between hOBs and BNNTs and to study the effects of the 'BNNTs\u00a0+\u00a0US' stimulatory method on the osteoblastic function and maturation.A non-cytotoxic BNNT concentration to be used in vitro with hOB cultures was established. Moreover, investigation with transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (TEM/EELS) confirmed that BNNTs were internalized in membranal vesicles. The panel of investigated osteoblastic markers disclosed that BNNTs were capable of fostering the expression of late-stage bone proteins in vitro, without using any mineralizing culture supplements. In our samples, the maximal osteopontin expression, with the highest osteocalcin and Ca(2+) production, in the presence of mineral matrix with nodular morphology, was observed in the samples treated with BNNTs\u00a0+\u00a0US. In this group was also shown a significantly enhanced synthesis of TGF-\u03b21, a molecule sensitive to electric stimulation in bone.

Here we report a novel biotelemetry device made primarily of a coiled bundle of uniaxially-aligned biocompatible polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers of \u223c200 nm in diameter and with piezoelectric properties that can serve concurrently as a power source, sensor, and transmitter. We tested this device on a cantilever beam that was periodically deflected at its free end. Without a power supply the coil of a nanofiber bundle is shown to generate and transmit an electrical signal wirelessly in response to the beam deflection which was received by an external receiver. The coil of a nanofiber bundle was encapsulated in a thin biocompatible polymer shell for device integrity and moisture isolation.

{"title": "Optoacoustic monitoring of cutting efficiency and thermal damage during laser ablation.", "abstract": "Successful laser surgery is characterized by a precise cut and effective hemostasis with minimal collateral thermal damage to the adjacent tissues. Consequently, the surgeon needs to control several parameters, such as power, pulse repetition rate, and velocity of movements. In this study we propose utilizing optoacoustics for providing the necessary real-time feedback of cutting efficiency and collateral thermal damage. Laser ablation was performed on a bovine meat slab using a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser (532 nm, 4 kHz, 18 W). Due to the short pulse duration of 7.6 ns, the same laser has also been used for generation of optoacoustic signals. Both the shockwaves, generated due to tissue removal, as well as the normal optoacoustic responses from the surrounding tissue were detected using a single broadband piezoelectric transducer. It has been observed that the rapid reduction in the shockwave amplitude occurs as more material is being removed, indicating decrease in cutting efficiency, whereas gradual decrease in the optoacoustic signal likely corresponds to coagulation around the ablation crater. Further heating of the surrounding tissue leads to carbonization accompanied by a significant shift in the optoacoustic spectra. Our results hold promise for real-time monitoring of cutting efficiency and collateral thermal damage during laser surgery. In practice, this could eventually facilitate development of automatic cut-off mechanisms that will guarantee an optimal tradeoff between cutting and heating while avoiding severe thermal damage to the surrounding tissues.", "journal": "Lasers in medical science", "date": "2013-10-23", "authors": ["ErwinBay", "AlexandreDouplik", "DanielRazansky"], "doi": "10.1007/s10103-013-1434-y"}

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may protect against the above mentioned diseases, but paradoxically the main DHA treated pathologies are also associated with increased ROS levels. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore if in vitro DHA supplementation may increase the sensitivity of cells to tert-BHP induced oxidative stress, and if the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is able to correct such detrimental effect. We found that DHA-enriched cells exacerbate ROS generation, decrease cell viability and increase Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 expression. Interestingly, cellular EGCG is able to counteract oxidative damage from either tert-BHP or DHA-enriched cells. In consequence, our results suggest that in a ROS enriched environment DHA could not always be beneficial for cells and can be considered a double-edged sword in terms of its benefits vs. risks.

The currently used methods for the analysis of optically active compounds are primarily high-performance separation methods, such as gas and liquid chromatography using chiral stationary phases or chiral selectors in the mobile phase, and highly efficient electromigration techniques, such as capillary electrophoresis using chiral selectors. Chemical sensors and biosensors may also be designed for the analysis of optically active compounds. As enantiomers of the same compound are characterised by almost identical physico-chemical properties, their differentiation/separation in one-step unit operation in steady-state or dynamic flow systems requires the use of highly effective chiral selectors. Examples of such determinations are reviewed in this paper, based on 105 references. The greatest successes for isomer determination involve immunochemical interactions, enantioselectivity of the enzymatic biocatalytic processes, and interactions with ion-channel receptors or molecularly imprinted polymers. Conducting such processes under dynamic flow conditions may significantly enhance the differences in the kinetics of such processes, leading to greater differences in the signals recorded for enantiomers.

Results show softening of the mechanical resonance frequencies at the D3m \u2192 C2/c ferroelastic transition temperature Ttrans = 453.6 K with no noticeable frequency dispersion. The reduction of resonance frequencies corresponds to 25% softening of the effective elastic constants at Ttrans relative to the value at 700 K. The data analysis indicates that the elastic precursor softening is driven by a displacive soft mode that is coupled to the order-disorder movements of Pb atoms around the rhombohedral threefold axis, which gives rise to local monoclinicity in the paraelastic phase. Finally, resonant piezoelectric spectroscopy (RPS) is used to determine if microstructures are polar in the cubic phase. RPS measurements find no evidence of piezoelectric signals in Pb3(PO4)2, confirming that the possible polar behavior detected using second harmonic generation is due to crystal imperfections.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

Meanwhile, the nanoscale piezoelectric properties of nacre have also been investigated but the structure-function relationship has never been addressed. In this work, firstly we realized quantitative nanomechanical mapping of nacre of a green abalone using atomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM). The modulus of the mineral tablets is determined to be ~80 GPa and that of the organic biopolymer no more than 23 GPa, and the organic-inorganic interface width is determined to be about 34 \u00b1 9 nm. Then, we conducted both AFAM and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) mapping in the same scanning area to explore the correlations between the nanomechanical and piezoelectric properties. The PFM testing shows that the organic biopolymer exhibits a significantly stronger piezoresponse than the mineral tablets, and they permeate each other, which is very difficult to reproduce in artificial materials. Finally, the phase hysteresis loops and amplitude butterfly loops were also observed using switching spectroscopy PFM, implying that nacre may also be a bio-ferroelectric material. The obtained nanoscale structural and functional properties of nacre could be very helpful in understanding its deformation mechanism and designing biomimetic materials of extraordinary properties.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2013-10-17", "authors": ["XilongZhou", "HongchenMiao", "FaxinLi"], "doi": "10.1039/c3nr02731g"}
{"title": "Numerical investigation of ultrasound reflection and backscatter measurements in cancellous bone on various receiving areas.", "abstract": "In this study, new ultrasound reflection and backscatter measurements in cancellous bone using a membrane-type hydrophone are proposed. A membrane hydrophone made of a piezoelectric polymer film mounted on an annular frame allows an incident ultrasound wave to pass through its aperture because it has no backing material. Therefore, in measurements using the membrane hydrophone, the receiving area could be located independently from the transmitting area. In addition, the size and shape of the receiving area, which corresponded to those of the electrode deposited on the piezoelectric film, could be arranged in various ways. To investigate the validity of the proposed measurements, before bench-top experiments, the reflected and backscattered waves from cancellous bone were numerically simulated using a finite-difference time-domain method. The reflection and backscatter parameters were measured on various receiving areas, and their correlation coefficients with the structural parameters in the cancellous bone were derived. The simulated results suggested that appropriate receiving areas for the reflection and backscatter measurements could exist and that the proposed measurements could be more effective for evaluating bone properties than conventional measurements.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-10-17", "authors": ["AtsushiHosokawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.09.017"}
{"title": "Optimization of the magnetoelectric response of poly(vinylidene fluoride)/epoxy/Vitrovac laminates.", "abstract": "The effect of the bonding layer type and piezoelectric layer thickness on the magnetoelectric (ME) response of layered poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/epoxy/Vitrovac composites is reported. Three distinct epoxy types were tested, commercially known as M-Bond, Devcon, and Stycast. The main differences among them are their different mechanical characteristics, in particular the value of the Young modulus, and the coupling with the polymer and Vitrovac (Fe39Ni39Mo4Si6B12) layers of the laminate. The laminated composites prepared with M-Bond epoxy exhibit the highest ME coupling. Experimental results also show that the ME response increases with increasing PVDF thickness, the highest ME response of 53 V\u00b7cm(-1)\u00b7Oe(-1) being obtained for a 110 \u03bcm thick PVDF/M-Bond epoxy/Vitrovac laminate. The behavior of the ME laminates with increasing temperatures up to 90 \u00b0C shows a decrease of more than 80% in the ME response of the laminate, explained by the deteriorated coupling between the different layers. A two-dimensional numerical model of the ME laminate composite based on the finite element method was used to evaluate the experimental results. A comparison between numerical and experimental data allows us to select the appropriate epoxy and to optimize the piezoelectric PVDF layer width to maximize the induced magnetoelectric voltage. The obtained results show the critical role of the bonding layer and piezoelectric layer thickness in the ME performance of laminate composites.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2013-10-16", "authors": ["MSilva", "SReis", "C SLehmann", "PMartins", "SLanceros-Mendez", "ALasheras", "JGuti\u00e9rrez", "J MBarandiar\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1021/am4031054"}

Thus, investigating the osteoblastic secretome could yield important information for the pathophysiology of bone. In the present study, we characterized for the first time the secretome of human Hobit osteoblastic cells. We discovered that the secretome comprised 89 protein species including the powerful growth factor progranulin. Recombinant human progranulin (6nM) induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in both Hobit and osteocytic cells and induced cell proliferation and survival. Notably, risedronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis, induced the expression and secretion of progranulin in the Hobit secretome. In addition, our proteomic study of the Hobit secretome revealed that risedronate induced the expression of ERp57, HSP60 and HSC70, three proteins already shown to be associated with the prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.

The adhesion is strongly enhanced by the dynamic effect. When the retraction speed varies from 0.02 to 156 \u03bcm/s, the adhesion force increases by 10% to 50% in dry nitrogen while it increases by 15% to 70% in humid air. Among the material systems tested, the soft-soft contact systems exhibit the smallest dynamic effect while the hard-hard contacts show the largest enhancement.

The acoustic matching layer can be designed to achieve higher acoustic energy transmission and operating bandwidth. Also included in this paper are a theoretical analysis of the device design and a micromachining technique to produce the novel transducer. Based on a design of a lead titanium zirconium (PZT) micropillar array, the constructed gradient acoustic matching layer has much better acoustic transmission efficiency within a 20-50 MHz operation range compared to a matching layer with a conventional quarter-wavelength thickness Parylene deposition. To construct the transducer, periodic microcavities are built on a flexible copper sheet, and then the sheet forms a designed curvature with a ball shaping. After PZT slurry deposition, the constructed PZT micropillar array is released onto a curved thin PZT layer. Following Parylene conformal coating on the processed PZT micropillars, the PZT micropillars and the surrounding Parylene comprise a matching layer with gradient acoustic impedance.

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of traumatic pulp exposure on the osteo/odontogenic capacity of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs).\nRat incisors were artificially fractured and dental pulps were exposed to the oral environment for 48 h. Then, multi-colony-derived DPSCs from the injured pulps (iDPSCs) were isolated. Their osteo/odontogenic differentiation and the involvement of NF-\u03baB pathway were subsequently investigated.\niDPSCs presented a lower proliferative capacity than normal DPSCs (nDPSCs), as indicated by MTT and FCM assay. ALP levels in iDPSCs were significantly higher (P<0.01) than those in nDPSCs. Alizarin red staining revealed that iDPSCs exhibited an increased capacity of calcium deposition. Moreover, iDPSCs expressed stronger osteogenic markers (Runx2/RUNX2 and Ocn/OCN) and less odontogenic gene/protein (Dspp/DSP) than nDPSCs in vitro. In vivo transplantation showed that nDPSCs implants generated the typical dentine-pulp complex while all iDPSCs pellets formed the osteodentin-like tissues which were immunopositive for OCN. Mechanistically, iDPSCs expressed the higher levels of cytoplasmic phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1/P65 and nuclear P65 than nDPSCs, indicating an active cellular NF-\u03baB pathway in iDPSCs.

To harvest a cell sheet, the incubation temperature was reduced to 10\u00b0C for 30 minutes to allow the polymer chain to fully extend, changing the copolymer's phase from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity. Additional incubation at 20\u00b0C for 60 minutes was necessary to activate the cellular metabolism required for cytoskeletal organization and cell detachment.

{"title": "Measuring leg movements during sleep using accelerometry: comparison with EMG and piezo-electric scored events.", "abstract": "Periodic Limb Movements during Sleep (PLMS) can cause significant disturbance to sleep, resulting in daytime sleepiness and reduced quality of life. In conventional clinical practice, PLMS are measured using overnight electromyogram (EMG) of the tibialis anterior muscle, although historically they have also been measured using piezo-electric gauges placed over the muscle. However, PLMS counts (PLM index) do not correlate well with clinical symptomology. In this study, we propose that because EMG and piezo derived signals measure muscle activation rather than actual movement, they may count events with no appreciable movement of the limb and therefore no contribution to sleep disturbance. The aim of this study is thus to determine the percentage of clinically scored limb movements which are not associated with movement of the great toe measured using accelerometry. 9 participants were studied simultaneously with an overnight diagnostic polysomnogram (including EMG and piezo instrumentation of the right leg) and high temporal resolution accelerometry of the right great toe. Limb movements were scored, and peak acceleration during each scored movement was quantified. Across the participant population, 54.9% (range: 26.7-76.3) and 39.0% (range: 4.8-69.6) of limb movements scored using piezo and EMG instrumentation respectively, were not associated with toe movement measured with accelerometry. If sleep disturbance is the consequence of the limb movements, these results may explain why conventional piezo or EMG derived PLMI is poorly correlated with clinical symptomology.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Eight healthy male subjects (22-26 years old) sat on a chair with piezoelectric sensors. The experiment consisted of five acquisitions (300 s recording with 30 s resting). In the 1st acquisition, the subject was instructed to maintain a relax state. During the next three acquisitions, the subject maintained respiration rates of 3, 4, and 5 s. The order was randomly given for each subject. Finally, the subject was instructed to stay in a resting state for 300 s. Band-pass filters were used to separate the heartbeat and respiration signals from the output signal of the piezoelectric sensors (heartbeat: 0.7-7 Hz, respiration: 0.1-0.4 Hz). Then, the standard heartbeat interval was calculated using the autocorrelation function to generate a template. Heartbeat and respiration signals were extracted using a two-dimensional cross-correlation pattern matching method. For validation, the error ratio between the piezoelectric sensor data and the reference data was determined. The error ratios of the heartbeat interval and respiration interval were 2.89 \u00b1 4.41% and 5.57 \u00b1 4.42%, respectively.

The advent of optomechanical oscillator (OMO), enabled by strong interaction between circulating optical power and mechanical deformation in high quality factor optical microresonators, has created new possibilities for excitation and interrogation of micro/nanomechanical resonators. In particular, radiation pressure driven optomechanical oscillators (OMOs) are excellent candidates for mass detection/measurement due to their simplicity, sensitivity and all-optical operation. In an OMO, a high quality factor optical mode simultaneously serves as an efficient actuator and a sensitive probe for precise monitoring of the mechanical eigen-frequencies of the cavity structure.

Furthermore, brain extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), and an inflammatory marker, interleukin (IL)-6 were activated (P<0.05), while the protein levels of glyoxalase (GLO)-1, glutathione reductase (GSR)-1, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type (CAMK)-IV, cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were significantly less (P<0.05) in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of socially defeated rats, when compared to control rats.

{"title": "Glutamate-induced epigenetic and morphological changes allow rat M\u00fcller cell dedifferentiation but not further acquisition of a photoreceptor phenotype.", "abstract": "M\u00fcller cells are not only the main glial cell type in the retina but also latent progenitor/stem cells, which in pathological conditions can transdifferentiate to a neuronal phenotype and regenerate the neurons lost in a mature retina. Several signal transduction pathways can induce the dedifferentiation of mature M\u00fcller cells to a progenitor-like state, including that stimulated by glutamate. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which terminally differentiated cells are initially primed to acquire multipotency remain unclear. In the present study, we have characterized early genetic and epigenetic events that occur immediately after glutamate-induced dedifferentiation of fully differentiated M\u00fcller cells is initiated. Using M\u00fcller cell-enriched cultures from postnatal rats, we demonstrate that glutamate triggers a rapid dedifferentiation response characterized by changes in cell morphology coupled to the induction of progenitor cell marker gene expression (e.g., nestin, lin28 and sox2) within 1h. Dedifferentiation involved the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate and type II metabotropic glutamate receptors, as well as global DNA demethylation (evident through the decrease in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 immunoreactivity) and an increase in gadd45-\u03b2 gene expression; although, early progenitor gene expression was only partially inhibited by pharmacological impairment of DNA methylation. Importantly, the expression of M\u00fcller glia identity genes (i.e., glutamine synthetase; cellular retinaldehyde binding protein, CRALBP) is retained through the process. Dedifferentiated M\u00fcller cells held an early neuronal differentiation potential similar to that observed in retinal progenitor-enriched cultures but, contrary to the latter, dedifferentiated M\u00fcller cells failed to further differentiate into mature photoreceptor lineages. We speculate that, in spite of the initial triggering of the dedifferentiation pathways, these cells may exhibit a certain degree of epigenetic memory that precludes them from further differentiation.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-10-08", "authors": ["L IReyes-Aguirre", "SFerraro", "HQuintero", "S LS\u00e1nchez-Serrano", "AG\u00f3mez-Montalvo", "MLamas"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.09.048"}

The academic model is widely used in the analysis of traveling wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM).

On the other hand, identification modeling method, which is built based on the tested data, has obtained increasing application in the study of ultrasonic motor's control technology. Based on the identification model, many control strategies can be designed easily. But the identification model is an approximate model, so if a more accurate model of ultrasonic motor can be obtained, the analysis and design of motor control system will be more effective. Characteristic model is a kind of identification model which can accurately describe the characteristics of TWUSM. Based on the tested data, this paper proposes the modeling method of ultrasonic motor's characteristic model.

In this report, we present a protocol to label the LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins in cells with (32)P orthophosphate, thereby providing a means to measure the overall phosphorylation levels of these 2 proteins in cells. In brief, affinity tagged LRRK proteins are expressed in HEK293T cells which are exposed to medium containing (32)P-orthophosphate. The (32)P-orthophosphate is assimilated by the cells after only a few hours of incubation and all molecules in the cell containing phosphates are thereby radioactively labeled. Via the affinity tag (3xflag) the LRRK proteins are isolated from other cellular components by immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates are then separated via SDS-PAGE, blotted to PVDF membranes and analysis of the incorporated phosphates is performed by autoradiography ((32)P signal) and western detection (protein signal) of the proteins on the blots.

Besides, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect, flexoelectricity is allowed by symmetry in any material. Due to these qualities flexoelectricity has attracted growing interest during the past decade.

So this study aimed at discussing the effects of CD59 gene on occurrence and development of atherosclerosis and relative mechanism.\nApolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE (-/-)) mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, empty plasmid-treated group, 0.5 ml CD59-treated group and 1.0 ml CD59-treated group. At the end of the 12th week, CD59 mRNA levels in whole blood were determined by RT-PCR and CD59 protein expressions were detected by western blot. The biochemical indexes in blood serum were detected. The paraffin sections of aortic root of mice were made and the degrees of atherosclerotic plaques formation were observed by hematoxylin/eosin (HE) staining. The expressions of cell apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and Fas) and plaque stability related protein (MMP-2) were detected by immunohistochemistry. Then the cell apoptosis levels were detected by TUNEL, the expression of Cyclin D1 and the mRNA level of cyclin dependent protein kinase 4 (CDK4) were detected by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization, respectively.\nAtherosclerotic mouse model was successfully established. CD59 gene was overexpressed in blood cells and tissue cells after liposome transfection. CD59 could reduce blood lipid levels, promote the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and inhibit pro-apoptotic Fas proteins, so finally lead to degradation of apoptosis levels of endothelial cells. In addition, Cyclin D1 protein and CDK4 mRNA levels were restrained by CD59 so as to inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. CD59 could inhibit the formation of atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque by suppressing the MMP-2 expression, which was further confirmed by HE staining. The anti-atherosclerotic effects were enhanced with the increase of CD59 gene dose.\nCD59 could lower blood lipid levels, positively regulate cell cycle, maintain the stability of cell proliferation and apoptosis of aorta cells, slow down the development of atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque, and finally inhibit the progress of atherosclerosis.

A digital monitor based on an array of piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) is developed to record the impact region of impacts on-line. It is small in size, lightweight and has low power consumption, but there are two problems with the impact alarm region localization method of the digital monitor at the current stage. The first one is that the accuracy rate of the impact alarm region localization is low, especially on complex composite structures. The second problem is that the area of impact alarm region is large when a large scale structure is monitored and the number of PZTs is limited which increases the time and cost of damage inspections. To solve the two problems, an impact alarm region imaging and localization method based on digital sequences and time reversal is proposed. In this method, the frequency band of impact response signals is estimated based on the digital sequences first. Then, characteristic signals of impact response signals are constructed by sinusoidal modulation signals. Finally, the phase synthesis time reversal impact imaging method is adopted to obtain the impact region image. Depending on the image, an error ellipse is generated to give out the final impact alarm region. A validation experiment is implemented on a complex composite wing box of a real aircraft.

{"title": "Analysis of a piezoelectric power harvester with adjustable frequency by precise electric field method.", "abstract": "A power harvester with adjustable frequency, which consists of a hinged-hinged piezoelectric bimorph and a concentrated mass, is studied by the precise electric field method (PEFM), taking into account a distribution of the electric field over the thickness. Usually, using the equivalent electric field method (EEFM), the electric field is approximated as a constant value in the piezoelectric layer. Charge on the upper electrode (UEC) of the bimorph is often assumed as output charge. However, different output charge can be obtained by integrating on electric displacement over the electrode with different thickness coordinates. Therefore, an average charge (AC) on thickness is often assumed as the output value. This method is denoted EEFM AC. The flexural vibration of the bimorph is calculated by the three methods and their results are compared. Numerical results illustrate that EEFM UEC overestimates resonant frequency, output power, and efficiency. EEFM AC can accurately calculate the output power and efficiency, but underestimates resonant frequency. The performance of the harvester, which depends on concentrated mass weight, position, and circuit load, is analyzed using PEFM. The resonant frequency can be modulated 924 Hz by moving the concentrated mass along the bimorph.

{"title": "Piezoelectric fiber-composite-based cantilever sensor for electric-field-induced strain measurement in soft electroactive polymer.", "abstract": "Polymeric materials have been widely used in electronic and electromechanical transducer applications. Because of their low elastic modulus, it is quite challenging to accurately characterize the electric-field-induced strain and elastic modulus by conventional contact methods. In this paper, a piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) fiber-composite-based cantilever strain sensor has been investigated to accurately characterize the electric-field-induced strain response in the out-of-plane direction of soft electroactive polymer samples. By choosing appropriate substrate material and the thickness ratio of the fiber composite to the substrate, this strain sensor can be optimized to provide high sensitivity and high flexibility simultaneously. The high voltage sensitivity can be attributed to partial decoupling of the longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric responses, the improved piezoelectric coefficient and small dielectric permittivity.

In particular, it is crucial to use reliable temperature coefficients of the stiffness, piezoelectric, dielectric, and expansion constants of the propagation medium to achieve correct simulations of the considered devices. Currently, the best-suited piezoelectric material for high-temperature SAW applications is langasite (LGS). Unfortunately, the available coefficients do not allow for precise prediction of the temperature dependence of LGS-based SAW devices above 300\u00b0C. A novel method, based on a simulated annealing algorithm coupled with a Rayleigh wave simulation program, was developed to find optimal LGS temperature coefficients.

The mixer has dimensions 14 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 10 mm with a through-hole (7 mm), and piezoelectric elements bonded to its four identical sides. When the first bending vibration mode of the mixer is excited by ac voltages, rotational flow of liquid is generated by the rotation of an acoustic field (acoustic streaming) in the through-hole. This technology is useful in automating mixing processes such as the mixing by hand of a few drops of blood in medical testing. In this paper, we verify the driving principle experimentally and examine the characteristics of a prototype mixer, including the induced flow velocity, under changes of the amplitude and frequency of the applied voltages.

{"title": "Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of myoglobin in Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), a species with hypoxic tolerance.", "abstract": "The Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) is a hypoxia-tolerant species that lives at an altitude of 4,000-5,000 m above sea level on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding cytoplasmic hemoprotein that is abundantly expressed in oxidative skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Numerous studies have implicated that hypoxia regulates myoglobin expression to allow adaptation to conditions of hypoxic stress. Few studies have yet looked at the effect of myoglobin on the adaptation to severe environmental stress on TA. To investigate how the Tibetan antelope (TA) has adapted to a high altitude environment at the molecular level, we cloned and analyzed the myoglobin gene from TA, compared the expression of myoglobin mRNA and protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle between TA and low altitude sheep. The results indicated that the full-length myoglobin cDNA is composed of 1154 bp with a 111 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 578 bp 3' UTR and a 465 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 17.05 kD. The TA myoglobin cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were highly homologous with that of other species. When comparing the myoglobin sequence from TA with the Ovis aries myoglobin sequence, variations were observed at codons 21 (GGT\u2192GAT) and 78 (GAA\u2192AAG), and these variations lead to changes in the corresponding amino acids, i.e., Gly\u2192Asp and Glu\u2192Lys, respectively. But these amino acid substitutions are unlikely to effect the ability of binding oxygen because their location is less important, which is revealed by the secondary structure and 3D structure of TA myoglobin elaborated by homology modeling. However, the results of myoglobin expression in cardiac and skeletal muscles showed that they were both significantly higher than that in plain sheep not only in mRNA but also protein level. We speculated that the higher expression of myoglobin in TA cardiac and skeletal muscles improves their ability to obtain and store oxygen under hypoxic conditions. This study indicated that TA didn't improve the ability of carrying oxygen by changing the molecular structure of myoglobin, but through increasing the expression of myoglobin in cardiac and skeletal muscles.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2013-10-01", "authors": ["LanMa", "XiujuanShao", "YapingWang", "YingzhongYang", "ZhenzhongBai", "YanxiaZhao", "GuoenJin", "QinGa", "QuanyuYang", "Ri-LiGe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.030"}

The role of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), also known as CD326, in CaP progression and therapeutic resistance is still uncertain. Here, we aimed to investigate the roles of EpCAM in CaP metastasis and chemo/radioresistance. Expression of EpCAM in CaP cell lines and human CaP tissues was assessed using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. EpCAM was knocked down (KD) in PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP-C4-2B cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and KD results were confirmed by confocal microscope, Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell growth was evaluated by proliferation and colony formation assays. The invasive potential was assessed using a matrigel chamber assay. Tumorigenesis potential was measured by a sphere formation assay. Chemo-/radiosensitivity were measured using a colony formation assay. Over-expression of EpCAM was found in primary CaP tissues and lymph node metastases including cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells. KD of EpCAM suppressed CaP proliferation and invasive ability, reduced sphere formation, enhanced chemo-/radiosensitivity, and down-regulated E-cadherin, p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-4EBP1 and p-S6K expression in CaP cells.

Osteotomy and adjustment of the lateral nasal wall are important steps that necessitate careful planning and execution. A cadaver study was performed to evaluate the osteotomy result obtained with a newly designed piezoelectric-based scalpel.\nTwenty lateral osteotomies of the nasal wall were performed in 10 human cadaver noses. The osteotomies were conducted in 6 female and 4 male cadavers (age range, 65 to 83 yr; mean age, 74.8 yr). A specially designed Piezosurgery-based scalpel was used endonasally to perform the lateral osteotomy. Cutting of the bony nasal wall was performed subperiostally along the planned osteotomy route under tactile control. Digital infracturing was accomplished by applying gentle pressure. After completing the osteotomy, the osteotomy line and nasal mucosa were examined endoscopically. The skin cover was removed to examine the lateral bony nasal wall for the shape and amount of bone fragments, the osteotomy path, and mucosa involvement.\nUsing the Piezosurgery-based scalpel required a learning curve, but the handling was easy. It allowed an exact performance of the osteotomy and caused no mucosal tearing. If excessive force was used, the piezo tip stopped working. There was no comminuted fracture pattern and the lateral nasal wall remained in 1 piece. The duration of the osteotomy was 5 to 10 minutes on each side.\nThe piezoelectric-based scalpel is a useful tool, which can be used to perform osteotomy of the nasal wall.

{"title": "Temperature dependence of the piezotronic effect in ZnO nanowires.", "abstract": "A comprehensive investigation was carried out on n-type ZnO nanowires for studying the temperature dependence of the piezotronic effect from 77 to 300 K. In general, lowering the temperature results in a largely enhanced piezotronic effect. The experimental results show that the behaviors can be divided into three groups depending on the carrier doping level or conductivity of the ZnO nanowires. For nanowires with a low carrier density (<10(17)/cm(3) at 77 K), the pieozotronic effect is dominant at low temperature for dictating the transport properties of the nanowires; an opposite change of Schottky barrier heights at the two contacts as a function of temperature at a fixed strain was observed for the first time. At a moderate doping (between 10(17)/cm(3) and 10(18)/cm(3) at 77 K), the piezotronic effect is only dominant at one contact, because the screening effect of the carriers to the positive piezoelectric polarization charges at the other end (for n-type semiconductors).

{"title": "Fabrication of piezoelectric components for a tunable and efficient device for DNA delivery into mammalian cells.", "abstract": "We fabricated three piezoelectric components (PZT) that can produce ultrasonic waves with various generated power in order to improve the delivery of DNA molecule and polymer/DNA complexes into cells. Two cationic polymers (PEI and PDMAEMA) were interacted with DNA to form nano-scaled DNA/polymer complexes with/without the help of PZT devices. The application of PZT devices under optimal conditions helped to avoid cytotoxicity and greatly increased the transfection (DNA delivery) efficiency of these complexes in mammalian cells. The cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency were found to be correlated with the PZT-generated power, waveforms and duration of ultrasonic treatment. There was no observable cytotoxicity in our experimental models and, a maximum transfection efficiency 700% greater than that of polymer/DNA complexes without applying ultrasound was achieved. The transfection efficiency of plain polymer/DNA complexes (without PZT treatment) corresponded to a 630-fold increase in comparison to the naked DNA. The waveforms of generated ultrasound greatly influenced the transfection efficiency, while cytotoxicity was not significantly affected. This means that, for optimal DNA delivery, duration of the peak voltage (Vmax/Div) also plays a role. In addition, the generated waves from PZT do not cause dissociation of polymer/DNA complexes or a change in the particle sizes of these complexes. In conclusion, these results suggest that the operation of PZT devices can be a tunable/safe way to greatly improve DNA delivery for gene therapy.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2013-09-28", "authors": ["Wei-ChihHung", "Guo-HuaFeng", "Jong-YuhCherng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2013.08.019"}
{"title": "Caveolin-1 promotes gastric cancer progression by up-regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition by crosstalk of signalling mechanisms under hypoxic condition.", "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the second most fatal common form of cancer. The crosstalk among signalling pathways that results in the acceleration of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a pivotal role in the molecular mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis. To understand the role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the expression pattern was studied in human gastric adenocarcinoma tissues and also in AGS and KATO III cell lines. Here, we show that during hypoxic condition, the increase in the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) results in a significant decrease in the expression of caveolin-1 which is regulated by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). The reduced levels of Cav-1 correlated with the increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation resulting in the significant activation of its downstream target STAT3. Accumulation of pSTAT3 in the nucleus results in the decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of mesenchymal markers (Slug, \u03b1-SMA, N-cadherin and vimentin). Crosstalk of EGFR and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signalling with Wnt signalling enhances cell proliferation, cell survival and upregulates EMT. There was no significant alteration in the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal molecules in both the cell lines studied. Thus, we provide evidence that Cav-1 was modulated by HSP90 and functions as a crucial regulator of EMT in gastric cancer.", "journal": "European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)", "date": "2013-09-28", "authors": ["AnbarasuKannan", "ArunkumarKrishnan", "MohammedAli", "ShyamaSubramaniam", "DevarajHalagowder", "Niranjali DevarajSivasithamparam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejca.2013.08.016"}

For this purpose a part of an ultrasonic transducer array radiating in water is modeled around the frequency 0.5 MHz using the finite element method. The study is carried out at low frequency in order to respect the same operating conditions than the previous paper. This choice facilitated the fabrication of the transducer arrays and the comparison of the numerical results with the experimental ones. The modeled array is composed of seventeen elements with the central element excited, while the others are grounded. The matching layers and the backing are not taken into account which limits the crosstalk only to the piezoelectric elements and fluid. This consideration reduces the structure density mesh and results in faster computation time (about 25 min for each configuration using a computer with a processor Intel Core i5-3210M, frequency 2.5 GHz and having 4 Go memory (RAM)). The novelty of this research work is to prove the efficiency of the crosstalk correction method in large frequency band as it is the case in medical imaging.

The peptides were selected in order to have a large variability in physicochemical characteristics (including length). In virtual screening a rapid and cost-effective computational methodology for predicting binding scores of small peptide receptors vs. volatile compounds is proposed. Flexibility was considered for both ligands and peptides and each peptide conformer was treated as a possible receptor, generating a dedicated box and then running a docking process vs. all possible conformers of the 14 volatile compounds. The 5 peptides were covalently bound to gold nanoparticles and deposited onto 20 MHz quartz crystal microbalances to realize gas sensors.

To gain further insight into the effects of the mutation on the structure, stability and function of the enzyme, we measured the sensitivity of recombinant E104D mutant and wild type HsTIM to limited proteolysis. The mutation increases the susceptibility to proteolysis as consequence of the loss of rigidity of its overall 3-D structure. Unexpectedly, it was observed that proteolysis of wild type HsTIM generated two different stable nicked dimers. One was formed in relatively short times of incubation with proteinase K; as shown by spectrometric and crystallographic data, it corresponded to a dimer containing a nicked monomer and an intact monomer. The formation of the other nicked species requires relatively long incubation times with proteinase K and corresponds to a dimer with two clipped subunits. The first species retains 50% of the original activity, whereas the second species is inactive.

Many studies have proven clinical advantages of piezosurgery in terms of quality of cut, maneuverability, ease of use, and safety. However, few investigations have tested its superiority over the traditional osteotomy systems in terms of dynamics of bone healing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of bone healing after osteotomies with piezosurgery and to compare them with those associated to traditional bone drilling.\nOne hundred and ten rats were divided into two groups with 55 animals each. The animals were anesthetized and the tibiae were surgically exposed to create defects 2 mm in diameter by using piezosurgery (Piezo group) and conventional drilling (Drill group). Animals were sacrificed at 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days post-surgery. Bone samples were collected and processed for histological, histomorphometrical, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis. The histological analysis was performed at all time points (n = 8) whereas the histomorphometrical analysis was performed at 7, 14, 30 and 60 days post-surgery (n = 8). The immunolabeling was performed to detect Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Caspase-3 (CAS-3), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B Ligand (RANKL), and Osteocalcin (OC) at 3, 7, and 14 days (n = 3). For the molecular analysis, animals were sacrificed at 3, 7 and 14 days, total RNA was collected, and quantification of the expression of 21 genes related to BMP signaling, Wnt signaling, inflammation, osteogenenic and apoptotic pathways was performed by qRT-PCR (n = 5).\nHistologically and histomorphometrically, bone healing was similar in both groups with the exception of a slightly higher amount of newly formed bone observed at 30 days after piezosurgery (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR analyses didn't detect significant differences in expression of all the proteins and most of the genes tested.\nBased on the results of our study we conclude that in a rat tibial bone defect model the bone healing dynamics after piezosurgery are comparable to those observed with conventional drilling.\nA piezocirurgia \u00e9 um sistema de osteotomia utilizado em cirurgias m\u00e9dicas e odontol\u00f3gicas.

However, recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) extends survival for infantile Pompe patients. Although cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-negative patients, who lack detectable endogenous GAA, mount an immune response to rhGAA that renders the therapy ineffective, timely induction of immune tolerance in these patients may improve clinical outcomes. Previously, CRIM status has been determined by Western blot analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts, a process that can take a few weeks. We present a blood-based CRIM assay that can yield results within 48 to 72 h. Results from this assay have been confirmed by GAA Western blot analysis in fibroblasts or by GAA sequencing in a small number of Pompe disease patients.

Eight patients presenting 9 BRONJ sites were treated, 2 in the maxilla and 7 in the mandible. Reason for biphosphonate (BiP) intake was treatment of an oncologic disease for 5 patients and osteoporosis for 3. The oncologic and osteoporosis patients were diagnosed with BRONJ after 35-110 months and 80-183 months of BiP treatment, respectively. BRONJ 2 and 3 was found in 4 patients.

{"title": "Microfabrication of stacks of acoustic matching layers for 15 MHz ultrasonic transducers.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method used to manufacture stacks of multiple matching layers for 15 MHz piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, using fabrication technology derived from the MEMS industry. The acoustic matching layers were made on a silicon wafer substrate using micromachining techniques, i.e., lithography and etch, to design silicon and polymer layers with the desired acoustic properties. Two matching layer configurations were tested: a double layer structure consisting of a silicon-polymer composite and polymer and a triple layer structure consisting of silicon, composite, and polymer. The composite is a biphase material of silicon and polymer in 2-2 connectivity. The matching layers were manufactured by anisotropic wet etch of a (110)-oriented Silicon-on-Insulator wafer. The wafer was etched by KOH 40 wt%, to form 83 \u03bcm deep and 4.5mm long trenches that were subsequently filled with Spurr's epoxy, which has acoustic impedance 2.4 MRayl. This resulted in a stack of three layers: The silicon substrate, a silicon-polymer composite intermediate layer, and a polymer layer on the top. The stacks were bonded to PZT disks to form acoustic transducers and the acoustic performance of the fabricated transducers was tested in a pulse-echo setup, where center frequency, -6 dB relative bandwidth and insertion loss were measured. The transducer with two matching layers was measured to have a relative bandwidth of 70%, two-way insertion loss 18.4 dB and pulse length 196 ns. The transducers with three matching layers had fractional bandwidths from 90% to 93%, two-way insertion loss ranging from 18.3 to 25.4 dB, and pulse lengths 326 and 446 ns. The long pulse lengths of the transducers with three matching layers were attributed to ripple in the passband.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-09-18", "authors": ["TungManh", "Anh-Tuan ThaiNguyen", "Tonni FJohansen", "LarsHoff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.08.015"}

The obtained scaffolds reveal an anisotropic morphology with a fully interconnected network of pores. In vitro studies demonstrate a lack of cytotoxic effect of PHB-HV scaffolds. Direct contact assays also reveal their ability to support the culture of CNS-derived cells and mesenchymal-like stem cells from different sources.

The transmission characteristics such as relative bandwidth, pulse width, and acoustic sensitivity were calculated from the experimental results. The results of the experiment showed a relative bandwidth of 50% and a pulse width of 0.061 \u03bcs.

{"title": "Piezoelectric properties of aligned collagen membranes.", "abstract": "Electromechanical coupling, a phenomenon present in collagenous materials, may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Here, electromechanical coupling has been investigated via piezoresponse force microscopy in transparent and opaque membranes consisting of helical-like arrays of aligned type I collagen fibrils self-assembled from acidic solution. Using atomic force microscopy, the transparent membrane was determined to contain fibrils having an average diameter of 76 \u00b1 14 nm, whereas the opaque membrane comprised fibrils with an average diameter of 391 \u00b1 99 nm. As the acidity of the membranes must be neutralized before they can serve as cell culture substrates, the structure and piezoelectric properties of the membranes were measured under ambient conditions before and after the neutralization process. A crimp structure (1.59 \u00b1 0.37 \u00b5m in width) perpendicular to the fibril alignment became apparent in the transparent membrane when the pH was adjusted from acidic (pH = 2.5) to neutral (pH = 7) conditions. In addition, a 1.35-fold increase was observed in the amplitude of the shear piezoelectricity of the transparent membrane. The structure and piezoelectric properties of the opaque membrane were not significantly affected by the neutralization process. The results highlight the presence of an additional translational order in the transparent membrane in the direction perpendicular to the fibril alignment. The piezoelectric response of both membrane types was found to be an order of magnitude lower than that of collagen fibrils in rat tail tendon. This reduced response is attributed to less-ordered molecular assembly than is present in D-periodic collagen fibrils, as evidenced by the absence of D-periodicity in the membranes.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The conformational transitions of the purified subunits were studied through steady state as well as time resolved fluorescence and CD spectroscopy under various denaturing conditions. The mutant protein showed altered polarity around tryptophan residues, changed quenching parameters and also noticeably altered secondary and tertiary structure compared to the w-t protein. Mutant also exhibited a higher tendency than the w-t protein for aggregation which was examined using fluorescent (Thioflavin-T) and spectroscopic (Congo red) dye binding techniques. The pH stability of the w-t and mutant proteins varied at extreme acidic pH and the molten globule like structure of w-t at pH1 was absent in case of the mutant protein. Both the w-t and mutant proteins showed multi-step thermal and Gdn-HCl induced unfolding. Thus, the results provide insight into the alterations of NDUFS3 protein structure caused by the mutations, affecting the overall integrity of the protein and finally leading to disruption of Complex-I assembly.", "journal": "Biochimie", "date": "2013-09-14", "authors": ["Tulika MJaokar", "Deepak PPatil", "Yogesh SShouche", "Sushama MGaikwad", "C GSuresh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biochi.2013.08.032"}

Herein we present a systematic study of the different synthesis parameters that influence the ZnO seed layer and thus the resulting morphological features of the free-standing vertically oriented ZnO nanowires. We obtained a homogeneous coverage of transparent conductive substrates with high-aspect-ratio nanowire arrays (length/diameter ratio of up to 52). Such nanostructured vertical arrays were examined to assess their electric and piezoelectric properties, and showed an electric charge generation upon mechanical compressive stress. The principle of energy harvesting with these nanostructured ZnO arrays was demonstrated by connecting them to an electronic charge amplifier and storing the generated charge in a series of capacitors. We found that the generated charge and the electrical behavior of the ZnO nanowires are strictly dependent on the nanowire length. We have shown the importance of controlling the morphological properties of such ZnO nanostructures for optimizing a nanogenerator device.", "journal": "Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2013-09-13", "authors": ["Vivian Far\u00edasRivera", "FlorianAuras", "PaoloMotto", "StefanoStassi", "GiancarloCanavese", "EdvigeCelasco", "ThomasBein", "BarbaraOnida", "ValentinaCauda"], "doi": "10.1002/chem.201204429"}

Berberine was administered at daily doses of 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg by gavage for two successive days, 48 h after intraperitoneal CP injection (13 mg/kg). Mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last dose of berberine. Histopathological changes and the increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) induced by CP were significantly ameliorated by berberine in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, oxidative/nitrosative stress, evidenced by the increase in renal 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) expression, was significantly reduced. The expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was markedly suppressed by berberine, indicating the inhibition of inflammatory response. Treatment of CP-intoxicated animals with berberine also significantly reduced the expression of p53, active caspase-3 as well as autophagy marker light chain 3B (LC3B) in the kidneys. The results of the current study showed the nephroprotective activity of berberine against CP-induced renal injury, which could be attributed to the inhibition of oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis.", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "date": "2013-09-13", "authors": ["RobertDomitrovi\u0107", "OlgaCvijanovi\u0107", "EsterPernjak-Pugel", "MarkoSkoda", "LorenaMikeli\u0107", "ZeljkaCrn\u010devi\u0107-Orli\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2013.09.003"}

Our previous studies show that unsaturated lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) promote autophagy in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). In this study, we examined the mechanism by which HNE induces autophagy. Exposure of RASMC to HNE led to the modification of several proteins, most of which were identified by mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). HNE stimulated the phosphorylation of PKR-like ER kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 and increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) abundance. HNE treatment also increased LC3-II formation and the phosphorylation of JNK and p38. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK, but not p38, prevented HNE-induced HO-1 expression and LC3-II formation. Inhibition of JNK increased cell death in HNE-treated cells. Pretreatment with the chemical chaperone phenylbutryic acid prevented LC3-II formation as well as JNK phosphorylation and HO-1 induction. Taken together, these data suggest that autophagic responses triggered by unsaturated aldehydes could be attributed, in part, to ER stress, which stimulates autophagy by a JNK-dependent mechanism and promotes cell survival during oxidative stress.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2013-09-12", "authors": ["PetraHaberzettl", "Bradford GHill"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2012.10.003"}

These devices exploit piezoelectric, capacitive, and piezoresistive effects, and coupling between them. However, high-performance piezoresistivity (as defined by on/off ratio) has primarily been observed in macroscopic single crystals. In this Letter, we show for the first time that rare-earth monochalcogenides in thin film form can modulate a current by more than 1000 times due to a pressure-induced insulator to metal transition. Furthermore, films as thin as 8 nm show a piezoresistive response. The combination of high performance and scalability make these promising candidates for nanoscale applications, such as the recently proposed piezoelectronic transistor (PET).

Our results showed that melanin content was significantly reduced after menadione treatment in a dose-dependent manner. However, menadione treatment did not reduce tyrosinase activity directly. Wnt signaling is known to play a major role in the control of melanin synthesis. Thus, we tested the effects of menadione treatment on GSK3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin signaling, but found that menadione did not influence either of these signaling pathways. We also investigated changes in the phosphorylation of ERK, which is related to melanin regulation. These results indicated that menadione treatment led to the phosphorylation of ERK. Additionally, menadione treatment reduced both MITF and tyrosinase protein levels. Treatment with PD98059, a specific ERK pathway inhibitor, restored menadione-induced melanin reduction and also prevented MITF and tyrosinase downregulation by menadione.

Thus, we electrophysiologically and immunologically examined the properties of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) in guinea-pig AM cells. Bath application of GABA produced an inward current at -60 mV in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 32.3 \u03bcM. This GABA-induced current was enhanced by allopregnanolone at concentrations of 0.01 \u03bcM and more. A prior exposure to allopregnanolone resulted in a decrease in an EC50 for GABA in activating GABAARs. The GABA-induced current was suppressed by Zn(2+) in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 18 \u03bcM, whereas it was enhanced by 100 \u03bcM La(3+). The benzodiazepine analog diazepam was three times more potent than zolpidem in enhancing the GABA current, and it was also augmented by L-838,417, which has no action on \u03b11-containing GABAARs.

Incubation of rat brain endothelial cells (RBE4 cell line) with A\u03b21-40 increased the levels of several markers of ER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), in a time-dependent manner, and affected the Ca(2+) homeostasis due to the release of Ca(2+) from this intracellular store.

Enhanced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of the downstream caspase-9 were observed in cells treated with A\u03b21-40 concomitantly with caspase-12 activation.

Many current commercially available diagnostic platforms make use of detection systems employing capture agents composed of modified antigen-specific antibodies coupled with a variety of detection modalities, including radioimmunoassays, fluorescence-based detection assays, electro/chemiluminescence assays, and immunoradiometric assays. In the studies presented here, a novel frequency-modulating technology from BioScale called Acoustic Membrane MicroParticle (AMMP) detection was used to demonstrate a sensitive and reproducible method of incorporating aptamers as capture and detection agents. The method provides a robust and rapid detection of thrombin in human serum while also eliminating the labor-intensive efforts of Western blot analysis and is not affected by the interfering substances found in serum that often affect optical-based detection systems. In addition, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the adaptation of the AMMP platform to exploit aptamers against a clinically relevant target.

These communication balances are called niches. In this study, an easily implemented and material-independent cell-environment niche based on microreciprocating motions is developed to enhance cell growth. A micropositioning piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate stage is used to provide precise microreciprocating shear stress motions. Various shear stresses were applied to bovine endothelial cells (BECs) that were cultured on the artificially synthesized materials to obtain the suitable shear stress for growth enhancement. It was found that the suitable shear stress for apparent enhancement of BEC growth ranges from 1.8 to 2.2\u00a0N m(-2). Biopolymers were further used to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach using the optimized shear stress obtained from the culture on artificially synthesized polymers. The results further confirmed that the growth of BECs was enhanced as expected under the calculated reciprocating frequencies based on the suitable shear stress.

We enhanced the co-culture properties through intracellular stimulation produced by piezoelectric nanostructures (i.e., boron nitride nanotubes) activated by ultrasounds, thus exploiting the ability of boron nitride nanotubes to convert outer mechanical waves (such as ultrasounds) in intracellular electrical stimuli, by exploiting the direct piezoelectric effect. We demonstrated that nanotubes were internalized by muscle cells and localized in both early and late endosomes, while they were not internalized by the underneath fibroblast layer. Muscle cell differentiation benefited from the synergic combination of topographical, mechanical, chemical and nanoparticle-based stimuli, showing good myotube development and alignment towards a preferential direction, as well as high expression of genes encoding key proteins for muscle contraction (i.e., actin and myosin).

However, its application for acoustic emission (AE) source localization has been very limited. In this paper, two well-known nonlinear Kalman Filtering algorithms are presented to estimate the location of AE sources in anisotropic panels: the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). These algorithms are applied to two cases: velocity profile known (CASE I) and velocity profile unknown (CASE II). The algorithms are compared with a more traditional nonlinear least squares method. Experimental tests are carried out on a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite panel instrumented with a sparse array of piezoelectric transducers to validate the proposed approaches. AE sources are simulated using an instrumented miniature impulse hammer. In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithms, two metrics are used: (1) accuracy of the AE source localization and (2) computational cost.

The good penetration of near-infrared light and high receiving sensitivity of a broad-bandwidth, 572-element, 2-D polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) array at a low center frequency of 1\u00a0MHz were used with 20 channel simultaneous acquisition. Pseudo-lesions filled with dilute blood were imaged in three human breast specimens at various depths up to 49\u00a0mm. With near-infrared light illumination and 256-sample averaging, the extrapolated maximum depth in imaging a 2.4-mm blood-rich lesion with a 3-dB contrast-to-noise ratio in a compressed breast was 54\u00a0mm. Three-dimensional photoacoustic volume image stacks of the breasts were co-registered with 3-D ultrasound image stacks, suggesting for the first time that PAVI, based on the intrinsic tissue contrast, can visualize tissue interfaces other than those with blood, including the inner skin surface and connective tissue sheets.

These cardiovascular diseases have a relation to atherosclerosis marked by the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In this study, we investigated the influence of IH on cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cell (RASMC). The proliferation of RASMC was significantly increased by IH without changing the level of apoptosis. In order to see what induces RASMC proliferation, we investigated the influence of normoxia (N)-, IH- and sustained hypoxia (SH)-treated cell conditioned media on RASMC proliferation. IH-treated cell conditioned medium significantly increased RASMC proliferation compared with N-treated cell conditioned medium, but SH-treated cell conditioned medium did not. We next investigated the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family as autocrine growth factors. Among the EGF family, we found significant increases in mRNAs for epiregulin (ER), amphiregulin (AR) and neuregulin-1 (NRG1) in IH-treated cells and mature ER in IH-treated cell conditioned medium. We next investigated the changes in erbB family receptors that are receptors for ER, AR and NRG1, and found that erbB2 receptor mRNA and protein expressions were increased by IH, but not by SH. Phosphorylation of erbB2 receptor at Tyr-1248 that mediates intracellular signaling for several physiological effects including cell proliferation was increased by IH, but not by SH. In addition, inhibitor for erbB2 receptor suppressed IH-induced cell proliferation.

In this device, two identical surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated by interdigital transducers (IDTs) propagated toward a microchannel, which accordingly built up a standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) field across the channel. A numerical model, coupling a piezoelectric effect in the solid substrate and acoustic pressure in the fluid, was developed to provide a better understanding of SSAW-based particle manipulation. It was found that the pressure nodes across the channel were individual planes perpendicular to the solid substrate. In the separation experiments, two side sheath flows hydrodynamically focused the injected particle or cell mixtures into a very narrow stream along the centerline. Particles flowing through the SSAW field experienced an acoustic radiation force that highly depends on the particle properties. As a result, dissimilar particles or cells were laterally attracted toward the pressure nodes at different magnitudes, and were eventually switched to different outlets. Two types of fluorescent microspheres with different sizes were successfully separated using the developed device. In addition, Escherichia coli bacteria premixed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were also efficiently isolated using the SSAW-base separation technique.

From ballistocardiogram, heart rate and body movement information were extracted to develop an algorithm for classifying sleeping and awakening epochs. In total, ten normal subjects (mean age 38.7 \u00b1 14.6 years) and ten patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (mean age 44.2 \u00b1 16.5 years) of varying symptom severity participated in this study.

{"title": "Eco-friendly sonoluminescent determination of free glycerol in biodiesel samples.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a flow-batch methodology for the determination of free glycerol in biodiesel that is notably eco-friendly, since non-chemical reagents are used. Deionized water (the solvent) was used alone for glycerol (sample) extractions from the biodiesel. The same water was used to generate water-cavitation sonoluminescence signals, which were modulated by the quenching effect associated with the amount of extracted glycerol. The necessarily reproducible signal generation was achieved by using a simple and inexpensive piezoelectric device. A linear response was observed for glycerol within the 0.001-100 mg/L range, equivalent to 0.004-400 mg/kg free glycerol in biodiesel. The lowest measurable concentration of free glycerol was estimated at 1.0 \u00b5g/L. The selectivity of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing the shape and retention of both real and calibration samples to standard solution chromatograms, presenting no peaks other than glycerol. All samples (after extraction) are greatly diluted; this minimizes (toward non-detectability) potential interference effects. The methodology was successfully applied to biodiesel analysis at a high sampling rate, with neither reagent nor solvent (other than water), and with minimum waste generation. The results agreed with the reference method (ASTM D6584-07), at a 95% confidence level.", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["Paulo Henrique Gon\u00e7alves DiasDiniz", "Marcelo Fabi\u00e1nPistonesi", "M\u00e1rio C\u00e9sar Ugulinode Ara\u00fajo", "Beatriz Susana Fern\u00e1ndezBand"], "doi": "10.1016/j.talanta.2013.04.009"}

Often, licking for the retrieval of water reward is used as a measurable report of the animal's decision during reward-driven behaviour. However, licking behaviour can induce severe motion artifacts that interfere with two-photon imaging of cellular activity. Here, we describe a simple method for the online correction of licking-induced focus shifts for two-photon calcium imaging of neocortical neurons in the head-fixed mouse. We found that licking causes a stereotyped drop of neocortical tissue, shifting neurons up to 20 \u03bcm out of focus. Based on the measurement of licking with a piezo film sensor, we developed a feedback model, which provides a corrective signal for fast optical focus adjustments with an electrically tunable lens. Using online correction with this feedback model, we demonstrate a reduction of licking-related focus changes below 3 \u03bcm, minimizing motion artifact contamination of cellular calcium signals.

{"title": "Developmental and hypoxia-induced cell death share common ultrastructural and biochemical apoptotic features in the central nervous system.", "abstract": "Hypoxic insults during the perinatal period lead to motor and cognitive impairments that later appear during childhood. In the adult brain, hypoxic events often lead to necrotic neuronal death, depending on the region and intensity of the event. During development an active apoptotic cell death occurs and could be an important variable affecting the hypoxic insult outcome. In the present work we performed a comparative study, in a chick embryo model, of the phenotypes and molecular markers exhibited during developmental and hypoxic cell death (HxCD). Ultrastructural analysis of optic tectum cells of embryos subjected to hypoxia (8% O2, 60 min) revealed a clear apoptotic morphology that did not differ from the one exhibited during developmental cell death. Integrity of plasma membrane, condensation of chromatin in round well-defined bodies, and gradual shrinkage of the cell are all hallmarks of the apoptotic process and were present in both control and hypoxic cells. To elucidate if hypoxic and developmental cell deaths share a common mechanism we evaluated the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. A basal cleavage of caspase-9 and cytochrome c release was observed by co-immunofluorescence in control embryos, but hypoxic insult significantly increased the incidence of this colocalization. Caspase-8 cleavage remained unchanged after the hypoxic insult, suggesting that the extrinsic pathway would not be involved in hypoxic death. We also observed a significant decrease of Akt activation immediately after hypoxia, possibly facilitating the later release of cytochrome c. In addition we analyzed the influence of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in neuronal survival. Transection of RGC fibers at embryonic day (ED) 3 did not induce any change in developmental and HxCD at ED12. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that a hypoxic insult in the developing brain triggers the same apoptotic pathway as the active developmental death.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-08-13", "authors": ["V MPozo Devoto", "M EBogetti", "SFiszer de Plazas"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.07.065"}

We show that depletion of Ezh2 leads to increased expression of PSD-95, a critical plasticity gene, and that reduced PSD-95 gene transcription is correlated with enrichment of Ezh2 at the PSD-95 gene promoter; however, the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark is not present at the PSD-95 gene promoter, likely due to the antagonizing effects of the H3S28P and H3K27Ac marks and the activity of the H3K27 demethylases JMJD3 and UTX. In contrast, increased PSD-95 gene transcription is accompanied by the presence of Ezh1 and elongation-engaged RNA Polymerase II complexes at the PSD-95 gene promoter, while knock-down of Ezh1 reduces PSD-95 transcription.

Recent studies suggest that the expression levels of miRNAs that act as tumor suppressors are frequently reduced in cancers because of chromosome deletions, epigenetical changes, aberrant transcription, and disturbances in miRNA processing. MiR-143 and -145 are well-recognized miRNAs that are highly expressed in several tissues, but down-regulated in most types of cancers. However, the mechanism of this down-regulation has not been investigated in detail. Here, we show that DEAD-box RNA helicase 6, DDX6 (p54/RCK), post-transcriptionally down-regulated miR-143/145 expression by prompting the degradation of its host gene product, NCR143/145 RNA. In human gastric cancer cell line MKN45, DDX6 protein was abundantly expressed and accumulated in processing bodies (P-bodies). DDX6 preferentially increased the instability of non-coding RNA, NCR143/145, which encompasses the miR-143/145 cluster, and down-regulated the expression of mature miR-143/145. In human monocytic cell line THP-1, lipopolysaccharide treatment promoted the assembly of P-bodies and down-regulated the expression of NCR143/145 and its miR-143/145 rapidly. In these cells, cycloheximide treatment led to a loss of P-bodies and to an increase in NCR143/145 RNA stability, thus resulting in up-regulation of miR-143/145 expression.

Here we performed 2D-DIGE followed by MALDI TOF/TOF analysis to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in liver of pups born to mothers fed vitamin B12 deficient diet vis-\u00e0-vis control diet. To further establish causality, we analyzed the effect of B12 rehabilitation at parturition on the protein levels and the phenotype in pups. We identified 38 differentially expressed proteins that were enriched in pathways involved in the regulation of amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Further, three enzymes in the \u03b2-oxidation pathway (hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, medium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) were down-regulated in pups born to mothers fed vitamin B12 deficient diet. We observed age-dependent differential expression of peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 and \u03b3 in the deficient pups. Interestingly, expression of 27 proteins that were differentially expressed was restored to the control levels after rehabilitation of female rats with vitamin B12 from parturition.

Although PMN-PT can possess much higher piezoelectric sensitivity than traditional lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectrics, it is highly anisotropic and therefore there is a large gain in sensitivity only when the crystal structure is oriented in a specific direction. Because of this, simply replacing the PZT substrate with a PMN-PT cylinder is not an optimal solution because the crystal orientation does not uniformly align with the circumferential axis of the hydrophone. Therefore, a composite hydrophone that maintains the optimal crystal axis around the hydrophone circumference has been developed. An 11.3\u2009mm diameter composite hydrophone cylinder was fabricated from a single <110> cut PMN-PT rectangular plate. Solid end caps were applied to the cylinder and the sensitivity was directly compared with a solid PZT-5A cylindrical hydrophone of equal dimensions in a hydrophone test tank.

The effects of \u03b1-tomatine in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel against PC-3 cells were investigated in the present study. Combined treatment with a sub-toxic dose of \u03b1-tomatine and paclitaxel significantly decreased cell viability with concomitant increase in the percentage of apoptotic PC-3 cells. The combined treatment, however, had no cytotoxic effect on the non-neoplastic prostate RWPE-1 cells. Apoptosis of PC-3 cells was accompanied by the inhibition of PI3K/Akt pro-survival signaling, an increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD but a decrease in the expressions of anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Results from a mouse xenograft model showed the combined treatment completely suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth without significant side effects. Consistent with its in vitro anti-cancer effects, tumor materials from mice showed increased apoptosis of tumor cells with reduced protein expression of activated PI3K/Akt.

{"title": "Developmental changes in BDNF protein in the song control nuclei of zebra finches.", "abstract": "The zebra finch song system provides an excellent model to study the mechanisms underlying the development of sex difference in brain structure and function. Only male zebra finches sing and the brain nuclei controlling song learning and production are considerably larger than in females. Sexual differentiation may in part be regulated by estrogen, but other molecules including neurotrophic factors likely also affect masculinization. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role in numerous aspects of vertebrate brain development and function, including neurogenesis, cell survival, growth of axonal projections, synaptogenesis and processes linked to learning and memory. The current study investigated the expression of BDNF protein in juvenile males and females at four ages, as well as in adults, to begin to evaluate the potential roles of endogenous BDNF in particular stages of structural and functional development of the song system. In both HVC and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), males had more BDNF+ cells than females. The number of immunopositive cells increased in males and decreased in females as they matured, in a pattern generally consistent with a role for BDNF in sensorimotor integration of song learning. In addition, in HVC (but not RA) the ratio of mature BDNF compared to its precursor proBDNF was greater in adult males than those at post-hatching day 25, indicating a region-specific shift in the relative availability of the two forms. Collectively, the data suggest that changes in BDNF protein expression across development may be associated with song system maturation, particularly during the sensorimotor integration of masculine vocalizations.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-08-08", "authors": ["Y PTang", "JWade"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.07.062"}

{"title": "[Membrane fouling by secondary effluent of urban sewage and the membrane properties].", "abstract": "The fouling behavior of UF membranes by secondary effluent of municipal wastewater was investigated using both original PVDF membranes and PVA, PVP and PMMA modified PVDF membranes. The results showed that the structure parameters of UF membranes were optimized by blending; PVP and PVA could effectively improve the hydrophilicity and permeate flux of the membranes. The hydrophilicity and structure properties of UF membrane had stronger effect on the anti-fouling properties. Pore plugging resistance was the main reason for the unrecoverable fouling. For UF membranes with stronger hydrophilicity, there was some flux reduction in the initial filtration, which was attributed to the formation of concentration polarization layer. However, this layer can be easily removed and the irreversible fouling index (r(ir)) was 0, thus guaranteeing the membrane a better anti-fouling property. The dense membrane surface could prevent low-molecular-weight pollutants from entering the internal pores of the membrane. For UF membrane with fully developed macropores in the cross-section and loose spongy layer structure, pollutants deposition to membrane internal pores, which would cause membrane pore plugging, could be effectively inhibited. In contrast, for membranes with porous surface and not fully developed macropores in the cross-section, pore plugging was more prone to occur. As a result, flux declined seriously and was difficult to be recovered by physical cleaning, which gave rise to the irreversible fouling.", "journal": "Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue", "date": "2013-08-07", "authors": ["Xiao-rongMeng", "Hai-zhenZhang", "LeiWang", "Xu-dongWang", "LiangZhao"], "doi": null}

H2S, a metabolite of Hcy, has potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities; however, the effect of H2S has not been explored in Hcy (IC)-induced neurodegeneration and neurovascular dysfunction in mice. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the neuroprotective role of H2S on Hcy-induced neurodegeneration and neurovascular dysfunction. To test this hypothesis we employed wild-type (WT) males ages 8-10 weeks, WT+artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), WT+Hcy (0.5 \u03bcmol/\u03bcl) intracerebral injection (IC, one time only prior to NaHS treatment), WT+Hcy+NaHS (sodium hydrogen sulfide, precursor of H2S, 30 \u03bcmol/kg, body weight).

Upon prolonged nerve growth factor (NGF) exposure these tumor cells stop to divide, become polygonal, grow projections and start to look and behave like sympathetic neurons. Differentiation of PC12 cells can also be induced by peptidyl-aldehyde proteasome inhibitors, such as Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (also known as MG-132) or via infection of the cells with Rous sarcoma virus. The signal transduction pathways underlying process formation, however, are still not fully understood. The liganded NGF receptor initiates a protein kinase cascade a member of which is Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK). Active ERK1/2 enzymes phosphorylate various cytoplasmic proteins and can also be translocated into the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression by activating key transcription factors. Using immunological methods we detected phosphorylation of TrkA, prolongedactivation of Src, and ERK1/2 with nuclear translocation of the latter during MG-132-induced process formation of PC12 cells. Activated Src remained predominantly cytoplasmic. MG-132-induced sustained ERK1/2 activation, nuclear translocation and neuritogenesis required the intact function of Src since these phenomena were markedly reduced or failed upon chemical inhibition of Src tyrosine protein kinase activity.", "journal": "Neurochemistry international", "date": "2013-08-06", "authors": ["Okt\u00e1viaTarj\u00e1nyi", "GergelyBerta", "AlexandraHarci", "Eszter BBacsa", "Borb\u00e1laStark", "MariannaPap", "J\u00f3zsefSzeber\u00e9nyi", "Gy\u00f6rgyS\u00e9t\u00e1l\u00f3"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuint.2013.07.008"}

A systematic group of hyper-brush PEGylated diblock copolymers containing poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) and polystyrene (PS) was synthesized using an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method and varying PEGMA lengths. This study demonstrates the antibiofouling membrane surfaces by self-assembled anchoring PEGylated diblock copolymers of PS-b-PEGMA on the microporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. Two types of copolymers are used to modify the PVDF surface, one with different PS/PEGMA molar ratios in a range from 0.3 to 2.7 but the same PS molecular weights (MWs, \u223c5.7 kDa), the other with different copolymer MWs (\u223c11.4, 19.9, and 34.1 kDa) but the similar PS/PEGMA ratio (\u223c1.7 \u00b1 0.2). It was found that the adsorption capacities of diblock copolymers on PVDF membranes decreased as molar mass ratios of PS/PEGMA ratio reduced or molecular weights of PS-b-PEGMA increased because of steric hindrance. The increase in styrene content in copolymer enhanced the stability of polymer anchoring on the membrane, and the increase in PEGMA content enhanced the protein resistance of membranes. The optimum PS/PEGMA ratio was found to be in the range between 1.5 and 2.0 with copolymer MWs above 20.0 kDa for the ultrastable resistance of protein adsorption on the PEGylated PVDF membranes.

We present the use of piezoelectric technology to split thin unicortical calvarium for autogenous cranioplasty in a series of pediatric patients. Design : Retrospective review of a series of pediatric patients requiring reconstruction for skull defects. Patients/Intervention : Our series included a 2-year-old with a parietal skull tumor and resultant 3 \u00d7 3-cm defect after craniectomy, a 2-year-old with a 3 \u00d7 3-cm defect after excision of an occipital skull tumor, a 10-year-old with a 4 \u00d7 5-cm skull defect after excision of an occipital skull tumor, and a 13-year-old who suffered a gunshot to the forehead with a 12 \u00d7 7-cm frontal skull defect.

The PNP is a symmetrically designed instrument with a centrally located indenter tip attached to a force cell for measuring the forces between the tip and a specimen. Penetration of the indenter tip into the specimen surface is measured using two proximity sensors placed symmetrically about the indenter. Each proximity sensor is attached to a piezoelectric actuator that is servo controlled to maintain the sensor and the reference frame to which it is attached at a constant height relative to the specimen surface. As the indenter tip penetrates the specimen surface, the movement of the tip relative to the two surface reference frames is measured using capacitance gauges and the average of these displacements is used as a measure of penetration depth. The current indenter is capable of applying indentation forces of up to 150 mN with a noise floor below 2 \u03bcN rms for a sampling rate of 1 kHz, and measuring displacement with 0.4 nm rms noise for the same sampling rate. The proximity sensors are capable of maintaining surface height variations of less than 1.0 nm with penetration depths of up to 10 \u03bcm. Long-term stability tests indicate a total uncertainty in indentation depth less than 10 nm for periods as long as 12 h. To demonstrate instrument accuracy, repeated indention cycles were performed on a fused silica specimen using incrementally increasing indention force.

The absolute measurement of nanoscale displacements of such resonators remains a challenge, however, since the optical signal reflected from a cantilever whose dimensions are sub-wavelength is at best very weak. We describe a technique for quantitative analysis and fitting of scanning-electron microscope (SEM) linescans across a cantilever resonator, involving deconvolution from the vibrating resonator profile using the stationary resonator profile. This enables determination of the absolute amplitude of nanomechanical cantilever oscillations even when the oscillation amplitude is much smaller than the cantilever width. This technique is independent of any model of secondary-electron emission from the resonator and is, therefore, applicable to resonators with arbitrary geometry and material inhomogeneity. We demonstrate the technique using focussed-ion-beam-deposited tungsten cantilevers of radius ~60-170 nm inside a field-emission SEM, with excitation of the cantilever by a piezoelectric actuator allowing measurement of the full frequency response. Oscillation amplitudes approaching the size of the primary electron-beam can be resolved. We further show that the optimum electron-beam scan speed is determined by a compromise between deflection of the cantilever at low scan speeds and limited spatial resolution at high scan speeds.

According to the characteristics of polarization of croconic acid, we constructed a one-dimensional ferroelectric Hamiltonian model to describe the ferroelectric properties of croconic acid. Based on the Hamiltonian model, the thermal properties of the ferroelectricity of croconic acid were studied by Monte Carlo method. The simulated Curie temperature is 756 K, and the spontaneous polarization keeps well temperature range stability up to 400 K. These results are in good agreement with the experimental data.", "journal": "The Journal of chemical physics", "date": "2013-08-02", "authors": ["YaxuanCai", "ShijunLuo", "ZhanwuZhu", "HaoshuangGu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4813500"}

The scanning frequency of the WSL is 18 kHz, and the 10 dB scanning bandwidth is more than 90 nm around a center wavelength of 1,540 nm. The output from the WSL is coupled into the multiplexed FBG array, which consists of five FBGs. The reflected Bragg wavelengths of the FBGs are 1,532.02 nm, 1,537.84 nm, 1,543.48 nm, 1,547.98 nm, and 1,553.06 nm, respectively. A dynamic periodic strain ranging from 500 Hz to 2 kHz is applied to one of the multiplexed FBGs, which is fixed on the stage of the piezoelectric transducer stack. Good dynamic performance of the FBGs and recording of their fast Fourier transform spectra have been successfully achieved with a measuring speed of 18 kHz. The signal-to-noise ratio and the bandwidth over the whole frequency span are determined to be more than 30 dB and around 10 Hz, respectively. We successfully obtained a real-time measurement of the abrupt change of the periodic strain.

Poisoning of silkworms by organophosphate pesticides causes tremendous loss to the sericulture. In this study, Solexa sequencing technology was performed to profile the gene expression changes in the midgut of silkworms in response to 24h of phoxim exposure and the impact on detoxification, apoptosis and immune defense were addressed. The results showed that 254 genes displayed at least 2.0-fold changes in expression levels, with 148 genes up-regulated and 106 genes down-regulated. Cytochrome P450 played an important role in detoxification. Histopathology examination and transmission electron microscope revealed swollen mitochondria and disappearance of the cristae of mitochondria, which are the important features in insect apoptotic cells. Cytochrome C release from mitochondria into the cytoplasm was confirmed. In addition, the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) signal pathways were all inhibited using qRT-PCR.

Although this technological approach seems to be biologically appealing, the impact of durable polymers and metallic stent surfaces on vascular healing remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to compare the independent effect of a durable polymer and a metallic stent surface on thrombogenicity and endothelial cell coverage using different in vitro and in vivo experimental models.\nPlatinum chromium (PtCr) and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene (PVDF-HFP)-coated surfaces were evaluated in this study. Thrombogenicity was assessed by exposing all surfaces to human blood under shear flow conditions. The inflammatory potential of the material was evaluated by measuring cytokine release from THP-1 cells exposed to all surfaces for 24 hours. Endothelial cell coverage was evaluated by detection of CD31 after the stents were exposed to human coronary artery endothelial cells for \u2264 14 days. Platelet adhesion (P<0.01) and activation (P=0.03) on PVDF-HFP were greater than on PtCr. In vivo, PVDF-HFP revealed more neointimal area (P<0.01) and residual parastrut fibrin (P=0.01) at 30 days compared with PtCr. PtCr displayed higher endothelialization rates and higher vascular endothelial-cadherin expression at 7 and 14 days (P=0.02) compared with PVDF-HFP.\nThrombogenicity and vascular healing differ among metallic and polymeric stent surfaces.

{"title": "In Vivo Biophysical-stimulation Platform Applied to Rodent Calvarial Bone-defect Models.", "abstract": "Biophysical strain has been applied widely for bone regeneration. However, application of low-magnitude strains to cells on small-thickness scaffolds is problematic, especially in rodent calvarial defect models, because general translation systems have limitations in terms of generating low-magnitude smooth signals. To overcome these limitations, we developed an in vitro biophysical-stimulation platform for stimulation of cells on small-thickness scaffolds for rodent calvarial bone defects. The customized flexure-based translational nanoactuator enables generation of low-magnitude smooth signals at the subnano- to micrometer-scale. This nanoactuator, which is equipped with a piezoelectric actuator, is suitable for biological applications because it can generate friction-free motion with a high resolution. Moreover, its operation without wear or deterioration eliminates contamination factors in cell culture environments. The developed in vitro biophysical-stimulation platform using these nanoactuators showed predictable operational characteristics. Also, a few-micrometer sinusoidal signal was generated successfully without any distortion. Three-dimensional scaffolds fitting the critical-size rat calvarial defect model were fabricated using poly(caprolactone), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), and tricalcium phosphate. Runt-related transcription factor 2 expression was increased upon stimulation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) on these scaffolds were stimulated in the in vitro biophysical-stimulation platform. Additionally, the use of this platform resulted in up-regulation of alkaline phosphate, osteopontin, and osterix expression compared to the non-stimulated group.

By measuring the intradiscal pressure in vivo, the current study attempts to characterize an essential biomechanical parameter to provide a more comprehensive physiological understanding of the ovine intervertebral disc.\nIntradiscal pressure (IDP) was measured for 24 hours within the discs L2-L3 and L4-L5 via a piezo-resistive pressure sensor in one merino sheep. The data were divided into an activity and a recovery phase and the corresponding average pressures for both phases were determined. Additionally, IDPs for different static and dynamic activities were analyzed and juxtaposed to human data published previously. After sacrificing the sheep, the forces corresponding to the measured IDPs were examined ex vivo in an axial compression test.\nThe temporal patterns of IDP where pressure decreased during activity and increased during rest were comparable between humans and sheep. However, large differences were observed for different dynamic activities such as standing up or walking. Here, IDPs averaged 3.73\u00a0MPa and 1.60\u00a0MPa respectively, approximately two to four times higher in the ovine disc compared to human. These IDPs correspond to lower ex vivo derived axial compressive forces for the ovine disc in comparison to the human disc. For activity and rest, average ovine forces were 130\u00a0N and 58\u00a0N, compared to human forces of 400-600\u00a0N and 100\u00a0N, respectively.\nIn vivo IDPs were found to be higher in the ovine than in the human disc. In contrast, axial forces derived ex vivo were markedly lower in comparison to humans. Both should be considered in future preclinical tests of intradiscal therapies using the sheep.

Antiferroelectrics themselves are useful in large digital displacement transducers and energy-storage capacitors. Despite their technological importance, the reason why materials become antiferroelectric has remained allusive since their first discovery. Here we report the results of a study on the lattice dynamics of the antiferroelectric lead zirconate using inelastic and diffuse X-ray scattering techniques and the Brillouin light scattering. The analysis of the results reveals that the antiferroelectric state is a 'missed' incommensurate phase, and that the paraelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition is driven by the softening of a single lattice mode via flexoelectric coupling.

Pasteurized (72\u00b0C for 16 s) skim milk was MF (50 \u00b0C) at 3 CF (1.50, 2.25, and 3.00\u00d7), each on a separate day of processing starting with skim milk. Two phases of MF were used at each CF, with an initial startup-stabilization phase (40 min in full recycle mode) to achieve the desired CF, followed by a steady-state phase (90-min feed-and-bleed with recycle) where data was collected. The experiment was replicated 3 times, and SP removal from skim milk was quantified at each CF. System pressures, flow rates, CF, and fluxes were monitored during the 90-min run. Permeate flux increased (12.8, 15.3, and 19.0 kg/m(2) per hour) with decreasing CF from 3.00 to 1.50\u00d7, whereas fouled water flux did not differ among CF, indicating that the effect of membrane fouling on hydraulic resistance of the membrane was similar at all CF. However, the CF used when microfiltering skim milk (50\u00b0C) with a 0.3-\u03bcm polymeric SW PVDF membrane did affect the percentage of SP removed. As CF increased from 1.50 to 3.00\u00d7, the percentage of SP removed from skim milk increased from 10.56 to 35.57%, in a single stage bleed-and-feed MF system. Percentage SP removal from skim milk was lower than the theoretical value. Rejection of SP during MF of skim milk with SW PVDF membranes was caused by fouling of the membrane, not by the membrane itself and differences in the foulant characteristic among CF influenced SP rejection more than it influenced hydraulic resistance. We hypothesize that differences in the conditions near the surface of the membrane and within the pores during the first few minutes of processing, when casein micelles pass through the membrane, influenced the rejection of SP because more pore size narrowing and plugging occurred at low CF than at high CF due to a slower rate of gel layer formation at low CF. It is possible that percentage removal of SP from skim milk at 50 \u00b0C could be improved by optimization of the membrane pore size, feed solution composition and concentration, and controlling the rate of formation of the concentration polarization-derived gel layer at the surface of the membrane during the first few minutes of processing.", "journal": "Journal of dairy science", "date": "2013-07-31", "authors": ["S LBeckman", "D MBarbano"], "doi": "10.3168/jds.2013-6655"}

PVdF-HFP between two opposing electrodes enhances the device reliability, but lessens its power performance because of the extra diffusion resistance. Also noteworthy are the gel influences on the cycle stability. When the applied voltage is 2.0 or 2.5 V, both the LiPF6 and the gel capacitors exhibit excellent stability, typified by a retention ratio of \u226595% after 10,000 cycles. Their coulombic efficiencies quickly rise up, and hold steady at 100%. Nonetheless, when the applied voltage is 3.5 or 4.0 V, the cycle stability deteriorates, since the negative electrode potential descends below 0.9 V (vs. Li), leading to electrolyte decomposition and SEI formation. For the LiPF6 capacitor, its retention ratio could be around 60% after 10,000 cycles and the coulombic efficiency of 100% is difficult to reach throughout its cycle life. On the other hand, the gel capacitor cycles energy with a much higher retention ratio, >80% after 10,000 cycles, and a better coulombic efficiency, even though electrolyte decomposition still occurs. We attribute the superior stability of the gel capacitor to its extra diffusion resistance which slows down the performance deterioration.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2013-07-26", "authors": ["Yi-DengChiou", "Dah-ShyangTsai", "Hoa HungLam", "Chuan-huaChang", "Kuei-YiLee", "Ying-ShengHuang"], "doi": "10.1039/c3nr01980b"}

Synthetic hydroxyapatite is widely used in bone grafts and prosthetic pyroelectric coatings as it binds strongly with natural bone. Nanocrystalline synthetic hydroxyapatite films have recently been found to exhibit strong piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity. While a spontaneous polarization in hydroxyapatite has been predicted since 2005, the reversibility of this polarization (i.e. ferroelectricity) requires experimental evidence. Here we use piezoresponse force microscopy to demonstrate that nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite indeed exhibits ferroelectricity: a reversal of polarization under an electrical field. This finding will strengthen investigations on the role of electrical polarization in biomineralization and bone-density related diseases. As hydroxyapatite is one of the most common biocompatible materials, our findings will also stimulate systematic exploration of lead and rare-metal free ferroelectric devices for potential applications in areas as diverse as in vivo and ex vivo energy harvesting, biosensing and electronics.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2013-07-26", "authors": ["S BLang", "S A MTofail", "A LKholkin", "MWojta\u015b", "MGregor", "A AGandhi", "YWang", "SBauer", "MKrause", "APlecenik"], "doi": "10.1038/srep02215"}
{"title": "Pulsed nanogenerator with huge instantaneous output power density.", "abstract": "A nanogenerator (NG) usually gives a high output voltage but low output current, so that the output power is low. In this paper, we developed a general approach that gives a hugely improved instantaneous output power of the NG, while the entire output energy stays the same. Our design is based on an off-on-off contact based switching during mechanical triggering that largely reduces the duration of the charging/discharge process, so that the instantaneous output current pulse is hugely improved without sacrificing the output voltage. For a vertical contact-separation mode triboelectric NG (TENG), the instantaneous output current and power peak can reach as high as 0.53 A and 142 W at a load of 500 \u03a9, respectively. The corresponding instantaneous output current and power density peak even approach 1325 A/m(2) and 3.6 \u00d7 10(5) W/m(2), which are more than 2500 and 1100 times higher than the previous records of TENG, respectively. For the rotation disk based TENG in the lateral sliding mode, the instantaneous output current and power density of 104 A/m(2) and 1.4 \u00d7 10(4) W/m(2) have been demonstrated at a frequency of 106.7 Hz.

{"title": "Dependence of the impact response of polyvinylidene fluoride sensors on their supporting materials' elasticity.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is popular sensing material because of its unique piezoelectric characteristics. In this work an impact sensor was prepared from a sandwiched structure PVDF film, and the related detection circuits were presented. The dependence of the PVDF sensors' response on the elasticity of the supporting materials was examined and discussed. Here two response indexes were discussed, which were the peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) and the recovery time. Firstly, falling impact experiments were executed on desk-supported PVDF sensors (100 mm PVDF film) using free falls of different weights from different heights. Then the same shock experiments were repeated on the same sensor, but changing the backstops to a sponge and rubber, respectively. On the desk, the values of Vpp were bigger than when the other two backstops were used; but the changes of the impact energy could not be reflected by the PVDF sensor when it was supported by a hard material. It was found that the biggest sensitivity of the voltage response (about 96.62 V/J) was obtained by the sponge-supported sensor; for the same sensor, when it was supported by rubber, the slope was 82.26 V/J. Moreover, the recovery time for the desk-supported sensor was almost constant, varying from 0.15 to 0.18 s, while for the same sensor supported by sponge or rubber, its recovery time changed with the shifting of the impact energy in the range of 0.02~0.36 s, but no pattern could be found in the recovery-time characteristics.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2013-07-25", "authors": ["YunfangJia", "XinjuanChen", "QingshanNi", "LonghuaLi", "ChengJu"], "doi": "10.3390/s130708669\n10.1088/0957-0233/21/7/075202"}

Data communication is realized using pulse position modulation (PPM) as the signaling method and the elastic medium as the communication channel. The communication system first transmits a small number of training pulses to probe the dispersive medium. The time-reversed probe signals are then utilized as the information carrying waveforms. Rapid timing acquisition of transmitted waveforms for demodulation over elastic medium is made possible by exploring the reciprocity property of guided elastic waves. The experimental tests were conducted using a National Instrument PXI system for waveform excitation and data acquisition.

First, we show that both \u03b2-catenin small inhibitory RNA and a dominant negative-MYC expression vector markedly down-regulated the expressions of fibrogenic genes in freshly isolated HSC. We further show that acetaldehyde up-regulated platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta mRNA and protein expressions ranging from 4.0- to 7.2-fold (P<0.001). Acetaldehyde induced MYC and collagen type-1 alpha-2 mRNA and protein expressions were WNT independent because DKK1, an antagonist of the canonical WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway, completely failed to block these inductions. Acetaldehyde increased phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B) protein by 31% (P<0.01), whereas phospho-\u03b2-catenin protein decreased by 50% (P \u2264 0.01). Significantly, in contrast to 43% (P<0.01) inhibition of \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation in nucleoredoxin (NXN)-overexpressed HSC, acetaldehyde profoundly stimulated \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation by 51%, (P<0.01). Acetaldehyde also increased the cellular reactive oxygen species level 2-fold (P<0.001) with a concomitant 2-fold (P<0.001) increase in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts. Conversely, there was a 44% decrease (P<0.001) in glutathione levels with a concomitant 76% (P<0.001) decrease in the level of NXN/ disheveled (DVL) complex. Based on these findings, we conclude that actions of acetaldehyde are mediated by a mechanism that inactivates NXN by releasing DVL, leading to the inactivation of GSK3B, and thereby blocks \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Thus, the stabilized \u03b2-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it up-regulates the fibrogenic pathway genes.

This is an important issue to address because it could help clarify the influence of early drug exposure on neuronal plasticity and the involvement of dopaminergic sensitization in the etiopathology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, we decided to investigate the molecular alterations induced by the administration of AMPH during adolescence, when repeated exposure to the psychostimulant may interfere with developmental neuroplasticity. We investigated the expression of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and of two inducible-early genes (arc and cfos) that bridge neuronal activity with long-lasting functional alterations. We found that peri-pubertal treatment with AMPH induces long-lasting changes in the expression of bdnf and of activity-regulated genes in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal/frontal cortex, and leads to alterations of their short-term modulation in response to a subsequent acute AMPH challenge. These data suggest that AMPH exposure in peri-puberty may negatively affect the maturation of brain structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, which facilitate the development of dopamine sensitization and may contribute to dopamine-dependent behavioral dysfunctions and molecular alterations in adulthood.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["FCalabrese", "JRichetto", "GRacagni", "JFeldon", "UMeyer", "M ARiva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.07.018"}

Moreover, the interest in the reduction of maintenance cost is always present. In this context, this paper investigates experimentally the concept of vibratory conveying based on the use of piezoelectric materials for motion generation. A small-size prototype of a linear conveyor, in which lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) patches are bonded to the resilient elements, is described. One of the main design goals is that the prototype is intended to be fed directly from the electric network, aiming at avoiding the use of electronic equipment for driving. To comply with this feature and, at the same time, enable to adjust the transport velocity, a mechanical device has been conceived in such a way that the first natural frequency of the conveyor can be changed. It is shown that the transport velocity is determined by the proximity between the excitation frequency and the first natural frequency of the conveyor.

{"title": "Assessing the effects of sodium hypochlorite exposure on the characteristics of PVDF based membranes.", "abstract": "Sodium hypochlorite is commonly used as a cleaning agent to remove adsorbed foulants from PVDF based micro/ultra filtration membranes in water and wastewater treatment applications. Although effective for fouling control, extended sodium hypochlorite exposure can affect the physical/chemical characteristics and hinder the treatment performance of these membranes. To assess these effects, PVDF based membranes were exposed to sodium hypochlorite at different concentrations for varying periods of time, and the physical/chemical characteristics of the virgin and sodium hypochlorite exposed membranes were compared. The membranes were characterized based on chemical composition (FTIR and NMR), mechanical strength (yield strength), surface hydrophilicity (contact angle), pore size and porosity (scanning electron microscopy and challenge test), and membrane resistance (clean water permeation test). The results indicated that exposure dose and concentration of the sodium hypochlorite used have significant influence on the membrane characteristics. The impact of sodium hypochlorite exposure on the parameters investigated could be most accurately and consistently correlated to an exposure dose relationship of the form C(n)t (where, C = concentration and t = exposure time) rather than the Ct relationship commonly used to define the extent of exposure to cleaning agents. For all the parameters investigated, the power coefficient n was less than 1 indicating that time had a greater impact on the changes than did the concentration of the sodium hypochlorite. The results suggest that the use of sodium hypochlorite for chemical cleaning, at concentrations that are higher than those typically used for chemical cleaning would have less of an effect on the characteristics of the membrane materials.

{"title": "Nanofiber web textile dry electrodes for long-term biopotential recording.", "abstract": "Electrode properties are key to the quality of measured biopotential signals. Ubiquitous health care systems require long-term monitoring of biopotential signals from normal volunteers and patients in home or hospital environments. In these settings it is appropriate to use dry textile electrode networks for monitoring purposes, rather than the gel or saline-sponge skin interfaces used with Ag/AgCl electrodes. In this study, we report performance test results of two different electrospun conductive nanofiber webs, and three metal plated fabrics. We evaluated contact impedance, step response, noise and signal fidelity performance indices for all five dry electrodes, and compared them to those of conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Overall, we found nanofiber web electrodes matched Ag/AgCl electrode performance more closely than metal plated fabric electrodes, with the contact resistance and capacitance of Ag plated PVDF nanofiber web electrodes being most similar to Ag/AgCl over the 10 Hz to 500 kHz frequency range. We also observed that step responses of all three metal-plated fabrics were poorer than those for nanofiber web electrodes and Ag/AgCl. Further, noise standard deviation and noise power spectral densities were generally lower in nanofiber web electrodes than metal plated fabrics; and waveform fidelity of ECG-like traces recorded from nanofiber web electrodes was higher than for metal plated fabrics.

{"title": "Quantitative ultrasonic computed tomography using phase-insensitive pyroelectric detectors.", "abstract": "The principle of using ultrasonic computed tomography (UCT) clinically for mapping tissue acoustic properties was suggested almost 40\u00a0years ago. Despite strong research activity, UCT been unable to rival its x-ray counterpart in terms of the ability to distinguish tissue pathologies. Conventional piezoelectric detectors deployed in UCT are termed phase-sensitive (PS) and it is well established that this property can lead to artefacts related to refraction and phase-cancellation that mask true tissue structure, particularly for reconstructions involving attenuation. Equally, it has long been known that phase-insensitive (PI) detectors are more immune to this effect, although sufficiently sensitive devices for clinical use have not been available. This paper explores the application of novel PI detectors to UCT. Their operating principle is based on exploiting the pyroelectric properties of the piezoelectric polymer polyvinylidene difluoride. An important detector performance characteristic which makes it particularly suited to UCT, is the lack of directionality of the PI response, relative to the PS detector mode of operation. The performance of the detectors is compared to conventional PS detection methods, for quantitatively assessing the attenuation distribution within various test objects, including a two-phase polyurethane phantom. UCT images are presented for a range of single detector apertures; tomographic reconstruction images being compared with the known structure of phantoms containing inserts as small as 3\u00a0mm, which were readily imaged. For larger diameter inserts (>10\u00a0mm), the transmitter-detector combination was able to establish the attenuation coefficient of the insert to within \u00b110% of values determined separately from plane-wave measurements on representative material plaques. The research has demonstrated that the new PI detectors are significantly less susceptible to refraction and phase-cancellation artefacts, generating realistic images in situations where conventionally-employed through-transmission PS detection techniques were unable to do so.

The aim of this study was to compare filtration and centrifugation as two methods of saliva processing necessary for determining the levels of salivary leptin and adiponectin. Thirty-seven healthy patients (median age of 45 years; range 35-73) participated in the study. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected by a drooling technique. An aliquot was filtered using a Millex-Millipore(\u00ae) (0.45\u03bcm PVDF Dura Pore membrane) syringe and a second aliquot was centrifuged at 15000\u00d7g for 15min at 4\u00b0C. Leptin and adiponectin levels were analyzed using an ELISA kit for serum (RayBio(\u00ae), GA, USA) with minor modifications. Leptin and adiponectin levels following the filtration technique yielded comparable results with those after centrifugation. Correlation was observed between filtered and centrifuged salivary leptin levels ((r=0.9155; 95% CI 0.8362-0.9573; p<0.0001) with concordance correlation coefficient k 0.9114 (95% CI 0.8332-0.9539)).

In this study, we show that GBSS1 from Oryza sativa L. (OsGBSS1) can form oligomers in rice endosperm, and oligomerized OsGBSS1 exhibits much higher specific enzymatic activity than the monomer. A monomer-oligomer transition equilibrium for OsGBSS1 occurs in the endosperm during development. Redox potential is a key factor affecting the oligomer percentage as well as the enzymatic activity of OsGBSS1. Adenosine diphosphate glucose, the direct donor of glucose, also impacts OsGBSS1 oligomerization in a concentration-dependent manner. OsGBSS1 oligomerization is influenced by phosphorylation status, which was strongly enhanced by Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ATP treatment and was sharply weakened by protein phosphatase (PPase) treatment.

Each tibia was operated by the same technique, and there are therefore neighbor's implants installed by different techniques. Histomorphometric parameters were used: the volume occupied by trabecular bone around the implants (BV/TV), media thickness, separation and number of trabeculae around the loops, and the contact area (interface) directly between the bone and implant (BIC).\nBV/TV was similar for both techniques (P = 0.291). Reduction in trabecular thickness was observed for both techniques (P < 0.05), but then returned to prior levels, with no significant difference between techniques (P = 0.217). Trabecular number increased from day 7 to day 14 (P < 0.001) and remained constant afterward for both techniques. No difference in BIC was observed between techniques on day 28 (P = 0.961).\nPiezoelectric osteotomy allowed bone formation for osseointegration of titanium implants, was not associated with bone necrosis, and provided results similar to those of the conventional technique. The piezoelectric technique can be considered a viable alternative in dental implantology.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2013-07-10", "authors": ["Fl\u00e1vio de \u00c1vilaKfouri", "Monica TalaricoDuailibi", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Gon\u00e7alvesBretos", "Aluizio BarbosaCarvalho", "DeboraPallos", "Silvio EduardoDuailibi"], "doi": "10.1111/clr.12229"}

However, the purported presynaptic neuromodulator role of TRPV1Rs in glutamatergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic terminals of the rodent forebrain remains little understood. With the help of patch-clamp electrophysiology and neurochemical approaches, we mapped the age-dependence of presynaptic TRPV1R function, and furthermore, we aimed at exploring whether the presence of CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) influences the function of the TRPV1Rs, as both receptor types share endogenous ligands. We found that the major factor which affects presynaptic TRPV1R function is age: by post-natal day 13, the amplitude of capsaicin-induced release of dopamine and glutamate is halved in the rat striatum, and two weeks later, capsaicin already loses its effect. However, TRPV1R receptor function is not enhanced by chemical or genetic ablation of the CB1Rs in dopaminergic, glutamatergic and serotonergic terminals of the mouse brain.

To explore the role of ALLN against colon cancer and in promoting apoptosis, we used colon cancer HCT116 cell lines, p53 or Bax-deficient HCT116 cell lines. Cell viability and tumor growth decreased in a concentration-dependent manner when treated with 0-26\u03bcM ALLN. Treatment with ALLN induced apoptosis in HCT116 cell; however, flow cytometry showed that apoptosis significantly decreased in Bax-deficient HCT116 cell lines, but not in p53-deficient HCT116 cell lines. In addition, the ALLN-induced apoptosis response was through Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria. In this study we showed intraperitoneally injected ALLN to inhibit colon tumor formation in nude mice, and found ALLN to inhibit tumor growth in colon cancer cells, mainly through apoptosis that depends on translocation of Bax to a mitochondrial endogenous pathway; this implies a molecular mechanism for ALLN against human colon cancer.

{"title": "An examination of cardiovascular collapse induced by eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis) venom.", "abstract": "The Pseudonaja genus (Brown snakes) is widely distributed across Australia and bites account for significant mortality. Venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC) and, less often, early cardiovascular collapse occur following envenoming by these snakes. We have previously examined possible mechanism(s) behind the early cardiovascular collapse following Papuan taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) envenoming. In the present study, we investigate early cardiovascular collapse in anaesthetized rats following administration of eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis) venom, and prevention of this effect with prior administration of 'priming' doses (i.e. doses of venom which caused a transient hypotensive response) of venom. P. textilis venom (5-10 \u03bcg/kg, i.v.) induced cardiovascular collapse in anaesthetized rats, characterized by a rapid decrease in systolic blood pressure until non recordable. Prior administration of 'priming' doses of P. textilis venom (2 and 3 \u03bcg/kg) or, at least, 4-5 doses of O. scutellatus (2 \u03bcg/kg, i.v.) or Daboia russelii limitis (20 \u03bcg/kg, i.v.) venoms prevented cardiovascular collapse induced by P. textilis venom. Moreover, early collapse was also inhibited by prior administration of 2 discrete doses of Acanthophis rugosus venom. Prior administration of commercial polyvalent snake antivenom (500-3000 units/kg, i.v.) or heparin (300 units/kg, i.v.) also inhibited P. textilis venom-induced cardiovascular collapse. Our results indicate that P. textilis venom-induced cardiovascular collapse can be prevented by prior administration of sub-lethal doses of venom from P. textilis, O. scutellatus, A. rugosus and D. russelii limitis.

{"title": "Increased lysosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage after traumatic brain injury in progranulin-deficient mice.", "abstract": "Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients with the homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGRN is related to lysosomal function. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of PGRN in the lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized with Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO) mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI. Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice. The number of activated microglia with TFEB localized to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, we compared ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTORC1 activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive cells around the injury was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the lysosome is involved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to increased TFEB nuclear translocation with a resultant increase in lysosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex after TBI.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-07-09", "authors": ["YTanaka", "TMatsuwaki", "KYamanouchi", "MNishihara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.049"}

Today, the huge arsenal of micro-sensors has revolutionized the traditional methods of analysis by, e.g. replacing expensive laboratory equipment, and has made the remote screening of atmospheric threats possible. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors - based on piezoelectric crystal resonators - are extremely sensitive to even very small perturbations in the external atmosphere, because the energy associated with the acoustic waves is confined to the crystal surface. Combined with suitably designed molecular recognition materials SAW devices could develop into highly selective and fast responsive miniaturized sensors, which are capable of continuously monitoring a specific organic gas, preferably in the sub-ppm regime. For this purpose, different types of recognition layers ranging from nanostructured metal oxides and carbons to pristine or molecularly imprinted polymers and self-assembled monolayers have been applied in the past decade. We present a critical review of the recent developments in nano- and micro-engineered synthetic recognition materials predominantly used for SAW-based organic vapor sensors.

The aim of the present study was the investigation of placental proteins as targets for auto-antibodies in PE patients. 2D-PAGE technique was used for separation of the total human placental proteins. After separation, protein spots were transferred to the PVDF membranes and blotted with sera from 20 PE patients and compared with membranes blotted with 20 sera from normal women. MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry technique was used for identification of differentially blotted spots. Moreover, the results of mass analysis were confirmed using western blot with commercial mAbs and RT-PCR technique. The results indicated that two placental proteins, annexin A1 and vitamin D binding protein (DBP), might be targeted by PE sera. The expression of annexin A1 and DBP was also confirmed at RNA level using the RT-PCR technique. Furthermore, the mass results were confirmed by western blotting with commercial mAbs against two targeted proteins. The data of the present study suggest two new placental proteins, annexin A1 and DBP, as placental immune targets.

For preparation of this unit, first, a biotinylated bis(2,2'-bithien-5-yl)methane functional monomer was designed and synthesized. Then, this monomer was potentiodynamically polymerized to form films on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and a Au electrode of a quartz crystal resonator (QCR) for the EIS and PM transduction, respectively. On top of these films, neutravidin was irreversibly immobilized by complexing the biotin moieties of the polymer. Finally, recognizing biotinylated oligonucleotide was attached by complexing the surface-immobilized neutravidin. This layer-by-layer assembling of the poly(thiophene-biotin)-neutravidin-(biotin-oligonucleotide) recognition film served to determine the target oligonucleotide via complementary nucleobase pairing. Under optimized determination conditions, the target oligonucleotide limit of detection (LOD) was 0.5 pM and 50 nM for the EIS and PM transduction, respectively. The sensor response to the target oligonucleotide was linear with respect to logarithm of the target oligonucleotide concentration in a wide range of 0.5 pM to 30 \u03bcM and with respect to its concentration in the range of 50 to 600 nM for the EIS and PM transduction, respectively.

We have previously demonstrated the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production may be regulated by NF-\u03baB acetylation via an NF-\u03baB responsive element within the nNOS promoter in neuronal cells. p300 is a ubiquitous transcription coactivator with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which is important in the nervous system. In the present study, we aimed at probing if p300 participated in regulating the nNOS expression through the NF-\u03baB-mediated way. As a result, we found p300 enhanced the nNOS protein and mRNA levels in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells by enhancing the binding of NF-\u03baB to the nNOS promoter and NF-\u03baB-mediated nNOS transcription. Meanwhile, p300 was shown to directly acetylate NF-\u03baB p65 and p50 subunits, interact with NF-\u03baB and bind to the NF-\u03baB responsive element region within the nNOS promoter. Taken together, our results indicate p300 acts as both an HAT and a coactivator in regulating NF-\u03baB-mediated nNOS expression, which provide some correlations between p300 and nNOS in neuronal cell, and suggest that some p300-related neurological disorders may be partially based on its effect on the nNOS expression.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-07-03", "authors": ["YLi", "CLi", "LSun", "GChu", "JLi", "FChen", "GLi", "YZhao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.030"}

CNCs having a lateral dimension of 3-5 nm and length of 50-500 nm incorporate the native crystalline structure with hydrogen-bonded cellulose chains in the parallel configuration. This facilitates asymmetric, selective chemical modification of the reducing ends through reductive amination. Successful thiol functionalization is demonstrated using cryo transmission electron microscopy based on selective attachment of silver nanoparticles to the CNC-SH ends to form Janus-like colloidal rod-sphere adducts. The extent of thiol modification of CNC-SHs is quantified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The promoted binding of CNC-SHs on gold surfaces is shown by atomic force microscopy and quartz crystal microbalance, where the high dissipation suggests pronounced orientational mobility due to flexible joints at one rod end onto the surfaces. That the joints are flexible is also shown by the bending and realignment of the CNC-SH rods using a receding triple-phase evaporation front of a drying drop of water. The ability of the hairy surface to size-selectively resist particle binding was also investigated.

They operate at room temperature and are free of any resource-critical rare-earth element, which makes them interesting for potential applications. Prior studies succeeded in showing strain-mediated coupling between the two subsystems. In particular, the electric properties can be tuned by magnetic fields and the magnetic properties by electric fields. Here we take the analysis of the coupling to a new level utilizing soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and its associated linear dichroism. We demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the (1,3)-type CoFe2O4/BaTiO3 structures and discuss it in terms of off-diagonal magnetostrictive-piezoelectric coupling. This coupling creates staggered in-plane components of the electric polarization, which are stable even at magnetic remanence due to hysteretic behaviour of structural changes in the BaTiO3 matrix.

{"title": "Highly hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes via postfabrication grafting of surface-tailored silica nanoparticles.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has drawn much attention as a predominant ultrafiltration (UF) membrane material due to its outstanding mechanical and physicochemical properties. However, current applications suffer from the low fouling resistance of the PVDF membrane due to the intrinsic hydrophobic property of the membrane. The present study demonstrates a novel approach for the fabrication of a highly hydrophilic PVDF UF membrane via postfabrication tethering of superhydrophilic silica nanoparticles (NPs) to the membrane surface. The pristine PVDF membrane was grafted with poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) by plasma induced graft copolymerization, providing sufficient carboxyl groups as anchor sites for the binding of silica NPs, which were surface-tailored with amine-terminated cationic ligands. The NP binding was achieved through a remarkably simple and effective dip-coating technique in the presence or absence of the N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) cross-linking process. The properties of the membrane prepared from the modification without EDC/NHS cross-linking were comparable to those for the membrane prepared with the EDC/NHS cross-linking. Both modifications almost doubled the surface energy of the functionalized membranes, which significantly improved the wettability of the membrane and converted the membrane surface from hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic. The irreversibly bound layer of superhydrophilic silica NPs endowed the membranes with strong antifouling performance as demonstrated by three sequential fouling filtration runs using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model organic foulant.

Different functionalized MWNTs (amine, -NH2; acid, -COOH) were incorporated in the blends by melt-mixing above the melting temperature of PVDF, where the blends are miscible, and the crystallization induced phase separation was probed in situ by shear rheology. Interestingly, only -NH2 functionalized MWNTs (a-MWNTs) aided in the formation of \u03b2-phase (trans-trans) crystals in PVDF, whereas both the neat blends and the blends with -COOH functionalized MWNTs (c-MWNTs) showed only \u03b1-phase (trans-gauche-trans-gauche') crystals as inferred from wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Furthermore, blends with only a-MWNTs facilitated in heterogeneous nucleation in the blends manifesting in an increase in the calorimetric crystallization temperature and hence, augmented the rheologically determined crystallization induced phase separation temperature. The dielectric relaxations associated with the crystalline phase of PVDF (\u03b1c) was completely absent in the blends with a-MWNTs in contrast to neat blends and the blends with c-MWNTs in the dielectric loss spectra. The relaxations in the blends investigated here appeared to follow Havriliak-Negami (HN) empirical equations, and, more interestingly, the dynamic heterogeneity in the system could be mapped by an extra relaxation at higher frequency at the crystallization-induced phase separation temperature. The mean relaxation time (\u03c4HN) was evaluated and observed to be delayed in the presence of MWNTs in the blends, more prominently in the case of blends with a-MWNTs. The latter also showed a significant increase in the dielectric relaxation strength (\u0394\u03b5). Electron microscopy and selective etching was used to confirm the localization of MWNTs in the amorphous phases of the interspherulitic regions as observed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The evolved crystalline morphology, during crystallization-induced phase separation, was observed to have a strong influence on the charge transport processes in the blends. These observations were further supported by the specific interactions (like dipole induced dipole interaction) between a-MWNTs and PVDF, as inferred from FTIR, and the differences in the crystalline morphology as observed from WXRD and polarized optical microscopy (POM).", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

This suggests that they might be therapeutic targets in pathogenic organisms. Pathogenic protozoa lead to diseases such as malaria, dysentery, leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis that are responsible for millions of deaths each year worldwide. We analyzed the genomes of pathogenic protozoa and show the existence within them of genes encoding putative homologues of mechanosensitive channels. Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi and Trichomonas vaginalis have genes encoding homologues of Piezo channels, while most pathogenic protozoa have genes encoding homologues of mechanosensitive small-conductance (MscS) and K(+)-dependent (MscK) channels. In contrast, all parasites examined lack genes encoding mechanosensitive large-conductance (MscL), mini-conductance (MscM) and degenerin/epithelial Na(+) (DEG/ENaC) channels. Multiple sequence alignments of evolutionarily distant protozoan, amoeban, plant, insect and vertebrate Piezo channel subunits define an absolutely conserved motif that may be involved in channel conductance or gating. MscS channels are not present in humans, and the sequences of protozoan and human homologues of Piezo channels differ substantially.

However, little is known about the effects of SNX-2112 on leukemias that are resistant to chemotherapy, which is emerging as a major clinical problem. In this study, the effects of SNX-2112 on the multidrug-resistant human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562/ADR cell line were investigated. We observed that SNX-2112 exhibited dose- and time-dependent inhibitory activities against K562/ADR cells. These effects included the induction of apoptosis and secondary necrosis in addition to cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2 phases. Furthermore, SNX-2112-induced apoptosis was predominantly mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, initiated by the release of cytochrome c and the participation of Bcl-2 family proteins. SNX-2112 also induced the activation of the caspase-3, -8 and -9 cascade and the subsequent cleavage of PARP in K562/ADR cells. Moreover, the inactivation of the Akt and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways may be involved in SNX-2112-induced apoptosis.

Thus, after purification of the human transferrin antigen from tens of microlitres of human plasma using an immunoaffinity membrane, transferrin polypeptide fragments were obtained on the plate following digestion with pepsin in the presence of 0.1% TFA or endoproteinase Lys-C or Lys-C/trypsin with 0.001% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The results indicated that the combined methods of isolation using an immunoaffinity membrane and enzymatic digestion on a MALDI-TOF MS plate could be applied to the purification and microanalysis of antigens.

Thus, we evaluated their anti-inflammatory activity via inhibition against production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with suppression against expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), in RAW 264.7 cells. The anti-inflammatory activity potential of the methanolic extract and its fractions of E. bicyclis was in the order of dichloromethane>methanol>ethyl acetate>n-butanol. The strong anti-inflammatory dichloromethane fraction was further purified to yield fucosterol. From the ethyl acetate fraction, six known phlorotannins were isolated: phloroglucinol, eckol, dieckol, 7-phloroeckol, phlorofucofuroeckol A and dioxinodehydroeckol. We found that these compounds, at non-toxic concentrations, dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced NO production. Fucosterol also inhibited t-BHP-induced ROS generation and suppressed the expression of iNOS and COX-2. These results indicate that E. bicyclis and its constituents exhibited anti-inflammatory activity which might attribute to inhibition of NO and ROS generation and suppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway and can therefore be considered as a useful therapeutic and preventive approach to various inflammatory and oxidative stress-related diseases.", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["Hyun AhJung", "Seong EunJin", "Bo RaAhn", "Chan MiLee", "Jae SueChoi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2013.05.061"}

Thin film based PVDF nasal sensor is designed in a cantilever beam configuration. Two cantilevers are mounted on a spectacle frame in such a way that the air flow from each nostril impinges on this sensor causing bending of the cantilever beams. Voltage signal produced due to air flow induced dynamic piezoelectric effect produce a respective RP. A group of 23 healthy awake human subjects are studied. The RP in terms of respiratory rate (RR) and Respiratory air-flow changes/alterations obtained from the developed PVDF nasal sensor are compared with RP obtained from respiratory inductance plethysmograph (RIP) device. The mean RR of the developed nasal sensor (19.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1) and the RIP (19.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1) are found to be almost same (difference not significant, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) with the correlation coefficient 0.96, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001. It was observed that any change/alterations in the pattern of RIP is followed by same amount of change/alterations in the pattern of PVDF nasal sensor with k\u00a0=\u00a00.815 indicating strong agreement between the PVDF nasal sensor and RIP respiratory air-flow pattern.

The thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus has three psbA genes differently expressed depending on the environmental conditions. Among the 344 residues of PsbA, there are 21 substitutions between PsbA1 and PsbA3, 31 between PsbA1 and PsbA2 and 27 between PsbA2 and PsbA3. In this study, we found a new hemoprotein that is expressed when the T. elongatus genome has only the psbA2 gene for D1. This hemoprotein was found in both the non-membrane proteins and associated to the purified PsbA2-PSII core complex. This protein could be removed by the washing of PSII with Tris-washing or CaCl2-washing. From MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometry, N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS/MS analysis upon tryptic digestion, the new hemoprotein was identified to be the tll0287 gene product with a molecular mass close to 19kDa. Until now, tll0287 was registered as a gene encoding a hypothetical protein with an unknown function. From the amino acid sequence and the EPR spectrum the 5th and 6th axial ligands of the heme iron are the His145 and likely either the Tyr93, Tyr159 or Tyr165, respectively. From EPR, the heme containing Tll0287 protein associated to PsbA2-PSII corresponds to approximately 25% of the Cytc550 content whereas, from SDS page analysis, the total amount of Tll0287 with and without the heme seems almost in a stoichiometric amount with PsbA2-PSII.

This study aimed to clarify the role played by the procyanidin trimer C1 in innate and adaptive immunity. Procyanidin C1 did not exert cytotoxicity at concentrations ranging from 7.8 to 62.5 \u03bcg/ml in macrophage cells; therefore, concentration of 62.5 \u03bcg/ml was used as the maximum dose of procyanidin C1 throughout subsequent experiments. Procyanidin C1 enhanced inducible nitric oxide synthase-mediated nitric oxide production in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, procyanidin C1 functionally induced macrophage activation by augmenting the expression of cell surface molecules (CD80, CD86, and MHC II) and proinflammatory cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6) via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), e.g., p38, ERK, and JNK and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling pathways. Interestingly, procyanidin C1 effectively polarized T helper type 1 (Th1) by secreting Th1-mediated cytokines (interferon-\u03b3, IL-12p70, and IL-2) and inducing splenocyte proliferation, indicating that procyanidin C1 contributes to Th1 polarization of the immune response. Accordingly, these findings confirms that the procyanidin C1 induces macrophage activation via NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways, leading to Th1 polarization in murine splenocytes, which suggests that procyanidin C1 regulates innate and adaptive immunity by macrophage activation and Th1 polarization.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["Nak-YunSung", "Mi-SoYang", "Du-SupSong", "Eui-BaekByun", "Jae-KyungKim", "Jong-HeumPark", "Beom-SeokSong", "Ju-WoonLee", "Sang-HyunPark", "Hyun-JinPark", "Myung-WooByun", "Eui-HongByun", "Jae-HunKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.02.059"}

However, up to 400% volume expansion during charge-discharge cycling coupled with a low intrinsic electronic conductivity causes pulverization and fracture, thus inhibiting silicon's widespread use in practical applications. We report herein on a low cost approach to fabricate hybrid silicon nanowire (SiNW)/graphene nanostructures that exhibit enhanced cycle performance with the capability of retaining more than 90% of their initial capacity after 50 cycles. We also demonstrate the use of hot-pressing in the absence of any common polymer binder such as PVDF to bind the hybrid structure to the current collector. The applied heat and pressure ensure strong adhesion between the SiNW/graphene nano-composite and current collector.

Pore size was controlled across a wide range by mixing DMSO with dioxane.

Images of fluorescent particles were obtained with a standard fluorescence microscope equipped with a piezo positioner for the objective. Whole pattern (WP) comparison with a PSF recorded for the specific set-up and measurement of the outermost ring radius (ORR) were used for analysis. Images of fluorescent particles were recorded over a large range (about 7\u03bcm) of vertical positions, with and without distortion by overlapping particles as well as in the presence of cultured endothelial cells. For a vertical range of 6.5\u03bcm the standard deviation (SD) from the predicted value, indicating validity, was 9.3/8.7 nm (WP/ORR) in the vertical and 8.2/11.7 nm in the horizontal direction. The precision, determined by repeated measurements, was 5.1/3.8 nm in the vertical and 2.9/3.7 nm in the horizontal direction. WP was more robust with respect to underexposure or overlapping images. On the surface of cultured endothelial cells, a layer with 2.5 times increased viscosity and a thickness of about 0.8\u03bcm was detected.

Cancer cells treated with the plant-derived perillyl alcohol (POH) or the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin dephosphorylate eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) and attenuate cap-dependent translation. We previously showed in cancer cell lines with elevated eIF4E that POH and rapamycin regulate telomerase activity through this pathway. Here, immortalized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) control cells and CHO cells with forced eIF4E expression (rb4E) were used to elucidate eIF4E's role in telomerase regulation by POH and rapamycin. Despite 5-fold higher eIF4E amounts in rb4E, telomerase activity, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mRNA, and TERT protein were nearly equivalent in control and rb4E cells. In control cells, telomerase activity, TERT mRNA and protein levels were unaffected by either compound. In contrast, telomerase activity and TERT protein were both attenuated by either agent in rb4E cells, but without corresponding TERT mRNA decreases indicating a translational/post-translational process. S6K, Akt, and 4E-BP1 were modulated by mTOR mediators only in the presence of increased eIF4E. Thus, eIF4E-overexpression in rb4E cells enables inhibitory effects of POH and rapamycin on telomerase and TERT protein.

While the atomic force microscope (AFM) offers a unique ability to probe tribological surfaces in a wear-free single-asperity contact, instrument calibration challenges have limited the usefulness of this technique for quantitative nanotribological studies. A number of lateral force calibration techniques have been proposed and used, but none has gained universal acceptance due to practical considerations, configuration limitations, or sensitivities to unknowable error sources. This paper describes a simple extension of the classic wedge method of AFM lateral force calibration which: (1) allows simultaneous calibration and measurement on any substrate, thus eliminating prior tip damage and confounding effects of instrument setup adjustments; (2) is insensitive to adhesion, PSD cross-talk, transducer/piezo-tube axis misalignment, and shear-center offset; (3) is applicable to integrated tips and colloidal probes; and (4) is generally applicable to any reciprocating friction coefficient measurement. The method was applied to AFM measurements of polished carbon (99.999% graphite) and single crystal MoS2 to demonstrate the technique. Carbon and single crystal MoS2 had friction coefficients of \u03bc = 0.20 \u00b1 0.04 and \u03bc = 0.006 \u00b1 0.001, respectively, against an integrated Si probe. Against a glass colloidal sphere, MoS2 had a friction coefficient of \u03bc = 0.005 \u00b1 0.001. Generally, the measurement uncertainties ranged from 10%-20% and were driven by the effect of actual frictional variation on the calibration rather than calibration error itself (i.e., due to misalignment, tip-offset, or probe radius).", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2013-06-08", "authors": ["H SKhare", "D LBurris"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4804163"}

Increasing the cantilever Q factor improves image resolution and reduces the risk of sample and cantilever damage.

An active impedance is placed in series with the tip oscillation voltage source to modify the mechanical dynamics of the cantilever.

{"title": "Wide-area scanner for high-speed atomic force microscopy.", "abstract": "High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) has recently been established. The dynamic processes and structural dynamics of protein molecules in action have been successfully visualized using HS-AFM. However, its maximum scan ranges in the X- and Y-directions have been limited to ~1 \u03bcm and ~4 \u03bcm, respectively, making it infeasible to observe the dynamics of much larger samples, including live cells. Here, we develop a wide-area scanner with a maximum XY scan range of ~46 \u00d7 46 \u03bcm(2) by magnifying the displacements of stack piezoelectric actuators using a leverage mechanism. Mechanical vibrations produced by fast displacement of the X-scanner are suppressed by a combination of feed-forward inverse compensation and the use of triangular scan signals with rounded vertices. As a result, the scan speed in the X-direction reaches 6.3 mm/s even for a scan size as large as ~40 \u03bcm. The nonlinearity of the X- and Y-piezoelectric actuators' displacements that arises from their hysteresis is eliminated by polynomial-approximation-based open-loop control. The interference between the X- and Y-scanners is also eliminated by the same technique. The usefulness of this wide-area scanner is demonstrated by video imaging of dynamic processes in live bacterial and eukaryotic cells.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2013-06-08", "authors": ["HirokiWatanabe", "TakayukiUchihashi", "ToshihideKobashi", "MikihiroShibata", "JunNishiyama", "RyoheiYasuda", "ToshioAndo"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4803449"}

The contribution of the inverse piezoelectricity into EFIOPC appears to be considerable and, in many cases, modifying, for instance, the spherical coordinates of the extreme directions or even leading to the appearance of new directional maxima on relevant ISs. The ISs of EFIOPC are of considerable practical importance as they allow us to determine an optimal geometry for electro-optic coupling. The spatial anisotropic analysis of EFIOPC in LiNbO(3):MgO crystals suggests that the lowest effective driving voltage is provided by electro-optic cells representing the rectangular slabs of X/50\u00b0 crystal cut.

However, until now both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that, for a given mechanical force, lateral bending of piezoelectric nanowires results in lower output electric potentials than vertical compression. Here we demonstrate that this result only applies to nanostructures with a constant cross-section. Moreover, though it is commonly believed that the output electric potential of a strained piezo-semiconductive device can only be reduced by the presence of free charges, we show that the output piezopotential of laterally bent tapered nanostructures, with typical doping levels and very small input forces, can be even increased up to two times by free charges.Our analyses confirm that, though not optimal for piezoelectric energy harvesting, lateral bending of tapered nanostructures with typical doping levels can be ideal for transducing tiny input mechanical forces into high and accessible piezopotentials.

{"title": "Molecular modeling of the piezoelectric effect in the ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF).", "abstract": "In this work, computational molecular modeling and exploration was applied to study the nature of the negative piezoelectric effect in the ferroelectric polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and the results confirmed by actual nanoscale measurements. First principle calculations were employed, using various quantum-chemical methods (QM), including semi-empirical (PM3) and various density functional theory (DFT) approaches, and in addition combined with molecular mechanics (MM) methods in complex joint approaches (QM/MM). Both PVDF molecular chains and a unit cell of crystalline \u03b2-phase PVDF were modeled. This computational molecular exploration clearly shows that the nature of the so-called negative piezo-electric effect in the ferroelectric PVDF polymer has a self-consistent quantum nature, and is related to the redistribution of the electron molecular orbitals (wave functions), leading to the shifting of atomic nuclei and reorganization of all total charges to the new, energetically optimal positions, under an applied electrical field. Molecular modeling and first principles calculations show that the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 has a negative sign, and its average values lies in the range of d 33 ~ -16.6 to -19.2 pC/N (or pm/V) (for dielectric permittivity \u03b5 = 5) and in the range of d 33 ~ -33.5 to -38.5 pC/N (or pm/V) (for \u03b5 = 10), corresponding to known data, and allowing us to explain the reasons for the negative sign of the piezo-response. We found that when a field is applied perpendicular to the PVDF chain length, as polarization increases the chain also stretches, increasing its length and reducing its height. For computed value of \u03b5 ~ 5 we obtained a value of d31 ~ +15.5 pC/N with a positive sign.

This paper presents a generalized method for impact detection and location on a flat plate, together with a calibration procedure with which to obtain the sound speed from only one set of measurements. This propagation speed is not well known as a result of either imprecise material properties or the overlapping of longitudinal and transversal waves with different propagation velocities. The use of only three piezoelectric sensors allows the position and time of impact on the flat plate to be obtained when the sound speed is well known, while the use of additional sensors permits a larger detection area to be covered, helps to estimate the sound speed and/or avoids the wrong timing of difference measurements.

By quantifying the photocatalytic oxidation of cimetidine under ultraviolet radiation and assessing the stability of TiO2 nanofibers integrated on the P-SSF against sonication, the optimum thickness of the TiO2 and PVDF layer was found to be 29 and 42 \u03bcm, respectively.

At flux conditions of 10, 20, and 50 L/m(2) h, the oxidation efficiencies for cimetidine were found to be 89, 64, and 47%, respectively.

To comply with airflow monitoring standards in the sleep lab setting thus often requires the patient to wear two sensors under the nose during testing. We hypothesized that a single combined thermal/pressure sensor using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film responsive to both airflow temperature and pressure would be effective in documenting abnormal breathing events during sleep.\nSixty patients undergoing routine PSG testing to rule out obstructive sleep apnea at two different sleep laboratories were asked to wear a third PVDF airflow sensor in addition to the traditional thermal sensor and pressure sensor.

Cuprizone-induced toxic demyelination shows clear characteristics of MS such as demyelination and axonal damage without the involvement of the innate immune system. In this study, we have evaluated glutamate signaling during cuprizone-induced demyelination in the white and gray matter of mouse brain by studying the expression of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate-receptors and -transporters by Affymetrix gene array analysis, followed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Cellular localization of glutamate transporters was investigated by fluorescence double-labeling experiments. Comparing white and gray matter areas, the expression of glutamate receptors was region-specific. Among NMDA receptor subunits, NR2A was up-regulated in the demyelinated corpus callosum (CC), whereas the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2 was down-regulated in demyelinated gray matter. Glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) co-localizing with GFAP(+) astrocytes was increased in both demyelinated CC and telencephalic cortex, whereas Slc1a4 transporter was up-regulated only in CC. Our data indicate that cuprizone treatment affects glutamate-receptors and -transporters differently in gray and white matter brain areas revealing particularly regulation of GLAST and Slc1a4 compared with other genes.

Three polymer membranes, polypropylene (PP), poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF) and nylon, were modified with polydopamine or poly(DOPA), and then immersed in 0.1M HCl or NaOH, followed by UV-vis spectrometry analysis to detect the presence of film detachment. The results showed that the outer parts of both polydopamine and poly(DOPA) films were detached, probably due to electrostatic repulsion between the polymers within the film, when the modified membranes were washed in HCl or NaOH solution. These two films were more stable in strongly acidic solution, but the stability of poly(DOPA) film was better than that of polydopamine film. Compared to the films on the surface of PVDF or nylon membrane, films on PP surface showed the lowest stability, possibly because of the hydrophobic property of PP. The process of film detachment was analyzed by GPC, which showed that unreacted dopamine or DOPA monomers were still present in the freshly formed films. The unreacted monomers, as well as polydopamine or poly(DOPA) that were incorporated in the film via noncovalent interactions, became detached when the film was exposed to strongly acidic or alkaline solution. Oxidation of freshly formed films could significantly enhance their stability.

The analyses of the data sets obtained by these complementary methods yield an integrated picture of the processes leading to the loss of monodispersity and increased median size of droplets from 90 \u03bcm up to 264 \u00b1 29 \u03bcm.

{"title": "The mitochondrial disease associated protein Ndufaf2 is dispensable for Complex-1 assembly but critical for the regulation of oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Deficiency in human mitochondrial Complex-1 has been linked to a wide variety of neurological disorders. Homozygous deletion of the Complex-1 associated protein, Ndufaf2, leads to a severe juvenile onset encephalopathy involving degeneration of the substantia nigra and other sub-cortical regions resulting in adolescent lethality. To understand the precise role of Ndufaf2 in Complex-1 function and its links to neurologic disease, we studied the effects on Complex-1 assembly and function, as well as pathological consequences at the cellular level, in multiple in vitro models of Ndufaf2 deficiency. Using both Ndufaf2-deficient human neuroblastoma cells and primary fibroblasts cultured from Ndufaf2 knock-out mice we found that Ndufaf2-deficiency selectively reduces Complex-1 activity. While Ndufaf2 is traditionally referred to as an assembly factor of Complex-1, surprisingly, however, Ndufaf2-deficient cells were able to assemble a fully mature Complex-1 enzyme, albeit with reduced kinetics. Importantly, no evidence of intermediate or incomplete assembly was observed. Ndufaf2 deficiency resulted in significant increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA deletion, consistent with contemporary hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of inherited mutations in Complex-1 disorders. These data suggest that Ndufaf2, unlike other Complex-1 assembly factors, may be more accurately described as a chaperone involved in proper folding during Complex-1 assembly, since it is dispensable for Complex-1 maturation but not its proper function.", "journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "date": "2013-05-25", "authors": ["Julia SSchlehe", "Marion S MJournel", "Kelsey PTaylor", "Katherine DAmodeo", "Matthew JLaVoie"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2013.05.007"}

Highly aligned and uniform In(x)Ga(1-x)N/GaN MQW layers are grown coaxially on the {1-100} sidewalls of hexagonal c-axis n-GaN NWs on Si(111) substrates by a pulsed flow metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that the wavelength and intensity of an MQW structure with various pairs (2-20) are very stable and possess composition-dependent emission ranging from 369 to 600 nm. The cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrum of individual In(x)Ga(1-x)N/GaN MQW NW is dominated by band-edge emission at 369 and 440 nm with a relatively homogeneous profile of parallel alignment. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) studies of coaxial InxGa1-xN/GaN MQW NWs measured along the [0001] and [2-1-10] zone axes reveal that the grown NWs are uniform with six nonpolar m-plane facets without any dislocations and stacking faults. The p-GaN/In(x)Ga(1-x)N/GaN MQW/n-GaN NW coaxial LEDs show a current rectification with a sharp onset voltage at 2.65 V in the forward bias. The linear enhancement of power output could be attributed to the elimination of piezoelectric fields in the In(x)Ga(1-x)N/GaN MQW active region. The superior performance of coaxial NW LEDs is observed in comparison with that of thin film LEDs. Overall, the feasibility of obtaining low defect and strain free m-plane coaxial NWs using pulsed MOCVD can be utilized for the realization of high-power LEDs without an efficiency droop.

Flexible PZT tactile sensors can overcome the diverse topology of various human regions and sense the corresponding signals from human bodies. The measured arterial pulse waveform can be used to diagnose hypertension and cardiac failure in patients. The proposed sensors have several advantages, such as flexibility, reliability, high strain, low cost, simple fabrication, and low temperature processing. The PZT thin-film deposition process includes a pyrolysis process at 150 \u00b0C/500 \u00b0C for 10/5 min, followed by an annealing process at 650 \u00b0C for 10 min.

The light weight of these x-ray optics enables large collecting areas, while the capability to correct mirror figure errors with the PZT thin film will allow much higher imaging resolution than possible with conventional lightweight optics. However, the low strain temperature and flexible nature of the thin glass complicate the use of chemical-solution deposition due to warping of the substrate at typical crystallization temperatures for the PZT. RF magnetron sputtering enabled preparation of PZT films with thicknesses up to 3 \u03bcm on Schott D263 glass substrates with much less deformation. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the films crystallized with the perovskite phase and showed no indication of secondary phases. Films with 1 cm(2) electrodes exhibited relative permittivity values near 1100 and loss tangents below 0.05. In addition, the remanent polarization was 26 \u03bcC/cm(2) with coercive fields of 33 kV/cm. The transverse piezoelectric coefficient was as high as -6.1\u00b10.6 C/m(2). To assess influence functions for the x-ray optics application, the piezoelectrically induced deflection of individual cells was measured and compared with finite-element-analysis calculations.

Development of label-free and highly sensitive biosensors has enabled the transduction of molecular recognition into detectable physical quantities. Microcantilever (MC)-based systems have played a widespread role in developing such biosensors. One of the most important drawbacks of all of the available biosensors is that they all come at a very high cost. Moreover, there are certain limitations in the measurement equipments attached to the biosensors which are mostly optical measurement systems. A unique self-sensing detection technique is proposed in this paper in order to address most of the limitations of the current measurement systems. A self-sensing bridge is used to excite piezoelectric MC-based sensor functioning in dynamic mode, which simultaneously measures the system's response through the self-induced voltage generated in the piezoelectric material. As a result, the need for bulky, expensive read-out equipment is eliminated. A comprehensive mathematical model is presented for the proposed self-sensing detection platform using distributed-parameters system modeling. An adaptation strategy is then implemented in the second part in order to compensate for the time-variation of piezoelectric properties which dynamically improves the behavior of the system. Finally, results are reported from an extensive experimental investigation carried out to prove the capability of the proposed platform. Experimental results verified the proposed mathematical modeling presented in the first part of the study with accuracy of 97.48%. Implementing the adaptation strategy increased the accuracy to 99.82%. These results proved the measurement capability of the proposed self-sensing strategy.

Langasite, a promising new piezoelectric material, is of current interest for a variety of applications because of its good temperature behavior, good piezoelectric coupling, low acoustic loss, and high Q-factor. It has been recently used to make high-temperature MEMS. In this paper, we report experimental measurements of the DLD of langasite resonators with different resonator configurations (plano-plano, single bevel, and double bevel). The results show that the resonator configuration affects the DLD of the langasite resonator. The DLD measurement results for langasite are compared with literature values for quartz, langaniste, and langatate, and with additional new measurements for a GaPO4 resonator of type R-30 (-11.1\u00b0 rotated Y-cut). Uncertainty analysis for the measured drive-level sensitivity is performed as well.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2013-05-11", "authors": ["HaifengZhang", "JohnKosinski", "YuanXie", "JosephTurner"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2653"}

{"title": "A simple and novel method to monitor breathing and heart rate in awake and urethane-anesthetized newborn rodents.", "abstract": "Rodents are most useful models to study physiological and pathophysiological processes in early development, because they are born in a relatively immature state. However, only few techniques are available to monitor non-invasively heart frequency and respiratory rate in neonatal rodents without restraining or hindering access to the animal. Here we describe experimental procedures that allow monitoring of heart frequency by electrocardiography (ECG) and breathing rate with a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) element without hindering access to the animal. These techniques can be easily installed and are used in the present study in unrestrained awake and anesthetized neonatal C57/Bl6 mice and Wistar rats between postnatal day 0 and 7. In line with previous reports from awake rodents we demonstrate that heart rate in rats and mice increases during the first postnatal week. Respiratory frequency did not differ between both species, but heart rate was significantly higher in mice than in rats. Further our data indicate that urethane, an agent that is widely used for anesthesia, induces a hypoventilation in neonates whilst heart rate remains unaffected at a dose of 1 g per kg body weight. Of note, hypoventilation induced by urethane was not detected in rats at postnatal 0/1. To verify the detected hypoventilation we performed blood gas analyses. We detected a respiratory acidosis reflected by a lower pH and elevated level in CO2 tension (pCO2) in both species upon urethane treatment. Furthermore we found that metabolism of urethane is different in P0/1 mice and rats and between P0/1 and P6/7 in both species. Our findings underline the usefulness of monitoring basic cardio-respiratory parameters in neonates during anesthesia. In addition our study gives information on developmental changes in heart and breathing frequency in newborn mice and rats and the effects of urethane in both species during the first postnatal week.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-05-10", "authors": ["Christoph MZehendner", "Heiko JLuhmann", "Jenq-WeiYang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0062628\n10.1038/nature09613\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.060\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06443.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050752\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0948-12.2012\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5646-08.2009\n10.1002/ana.22489\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00803.2004\n10.1152/ajpregu.00349.2007\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1212-12.2012\n10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.041\n10.1007/978-3-642-01651-6\n10.1152/physrev.00012.2009\n10.1056/NEJM198008213030806\n10.1152/ajpheart.01122.2007\n10.1007/s11517-006-0047-z\n10.1056/NEJMcpc1109276\n10.1124/jpet.103.049072\n10.1177/0884533608314534\n10.1203/01.PDR.0000148718.47137.9B\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.228551"}

In addition, the implementation of a parallel micro-gripper using bending piezoelectric bimorphs was presented. Both fingers were actuated separately to perform mini object handling. The bending piezoelectric bimorphs were fixed as cantilevers and individually driven using a high voltage amplifier and the bimorph deflection was measured using a non contact proximity sensor attached at the tip of one finger. The micro-gripper could perform precise micro-manipulation tasks and could handle objects down to 50 \u00b5m in size.

{"title": "Effect of IX dosing on polypropylene and PVDF membrane fouling control.", "abstract": "The performance of ion exchange (IX) resin for organics removal from wastewater was assessed using advanced characterisation techniques for varying doses of IX. Organic characterisation using liquid chromatography with a photodiode array (PDA) and fluorescence spectroscopy (Method A), and UV254, organic carbon and organic nitrogen detectors (Method B), was undertaken on wastewater before and after magnetic IX treatment. Results showed partial removal of the biopolymer fraction at high IX doses. With increasing concentration of IX, evidence for nitrogen-containing compounds such as proteins and amino acids disappeared from the LC-OND chromatogram, complementary to the fluorescence response. A greater fluorescence response of tryptophan-like proteins (278 nm/343 nm) for low IX concentrations was consistent with aggregation of tryptophan-like compounds into larger aggregates, either by self-aggregation or with polysaccharides. Recycling of IX resin through multiple adsorption steps without regeneration maintained the high level of humics removal but there was no continued removal of biopolymer. Subsequent membrane filtration of the IX treated waters resulted in complex fouling trends. Filtration tests with either polypropylene (PP) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes showed higher rates of initial fouling following treatment with high IX doses (10 mL/L) compared to filtration of untreated water, while treatment with lower IX doses resulted in decreased fouling rates relative to the untreated water. However, at longer filtration times the rate of fouling of IX treated waters was lower than untreated water and the relative fouling rates corresponded to the amount of biopolymer material in the feed. It was proposed that the mode of fouling changed from pore constriction during the initial filtration period to filter cake build up at longer filtration times. The organic composition strongly influenced the rate of fouling during the initial filtration period due to competitive adsorption processes, while at longer filtration times the rate of fouling appeared to depend upon the amount of biopolymer material in the feed water.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2013-05-08", "authors": ["Darli TheintMyat", "MaxMergen", "OliverZhao", "Matthew BStewart", "John DOrbell", "TonyMerle", "Jean-PhilippeCrou\u00e9", "StephenGray"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2013.03.056"}

Well-aligned ZnO-nanorod arrays (ZNAs) grown hydrothermally were chosen as positive templates. It was found that perovskite BFO could not be radio frequency (RF)-magnetron sputtered directly on a ZNA at elevated temperatures. Only amorphous BFO was obtained. However, polycrystalline BFO shells could be fabricated by RF-magnetron sputtering on ZNA templates by the introduction of LaNiO3 (LNO) buffer layers. The LNO buffer layer deposited on the ZNA by RF-magnetron sputtering was demonstrated to improve the adhesion and crystallization of the sequentially sputtered BFO shells. The electrical properties were evaluated by conductive atomic force microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy. Bulk-limited Poole-Frenkel emission dominates the conduction of BFO shells at positive bias, while barrier-limited Schottky emission accounts for the conduction at negative bias due to the interface between the Pt/Ir-coated tip and the BFO.

{"title": "Simultaneous recordings of ocular microtremor and microsaccades with a piezoelectric sensor and a video-oculography system.", "abstract": "Our eyes are in continuous motion. Even when we attempt to fix our gaze, we produce so called \"fixational eye movements\", which include microsaccades, drift, and ocular microtremor (OMT). Microsaccades, the largest and fastest type of fixational eye movement, shift the retinal image from several dozen to several hundred photoreceptors and have equivalent physical characteristics to saccades, only on a smaller scale (Martinez-Conde, Otero-Millan & Macknik, 2013). OMT occurs simultaneously with drift and is the smallest of the fixational eye movements (\u223c1 photoreceptor width, >0.5 arcmin), with dominant frequencies ranging from 70 Hz to 103 Hz (Martinez-Conde, Macknik & Hubel, 2004). Due to OMT's small amplitude and high frequency, the most accurate and stringent way to record it is the piezoelectric transduction method. Thus, OMT studies are far rarer than those focusing on microsaccades or drift. Here we conducted simultaneous recordings of OMT and microsaccades with a piezoelectric device and a commercial infrared video tracking system. We set out to determine whether OMT could help to restore perceptually faded targets during attempted fixation, and we also wondered whether the piezoelectric sensor could affect the characteristics of microsaccades. Our results showed that microsaccades, but not OMT, counteracted perceptual fading. We moreover found that the piezoelectric sensor affected microsaccades in a complex way, and that the oculomotor system adjusted to the stress brought on by the sensor by adjusting the magnitudes of microsaccades.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2013-05-03", "authors": ["Michael BMcCamy", "NiamhCollins", "JorgeOtero-Millan", "MohammedAl-Kalbani", "Stephen LMacknik", "DavisCoakley", "Xoana GTroncoso", "GerardBoyle", "VinodhNarayanan", "Thomas RWolf", "SusanaMartinez-Conde"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.14\n10.1016/0042-6989(95)00079-T\n10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728633\n10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352923\n10.1097/00006324-197612000-00005\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1488-12.2012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002741\n10.1007/BF02474271\n10.1038/217773a0\n10.1097/01.wnr.0000223392.82198.6d\n10.1093/bja/86.4.519\n10.1016/S0042-6989(98)00322-8\n10.1136/jnnp.68.5.639\n10.1098/rspb.1967.0028\n10.1007/BF00419631\n10.1167/8.14.20\n10.1152/jn.00746.2011\n10.1100/2012/956340\n10.1098/rstb.2000.0732\n10.1016/0042-6989(75)90259-X\n10.1016/S0079-6123(06)54009-9\n10.1016/S0042-6989(03)00084-1\n10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00697.x\n10.1073/pnas.0509557103\n10.1152/jn.00457.2001\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05735.x\n10.1093/brain/113.6.1857\n10.1126/science.1166112\n10.1016/S0925-2312(02)00371-5\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2003.12.002\n10.1016/j.visres.2004.09.029\n10.1016/0042-6989(91)90163-Y\n10.1038/nrn1348\n10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.033\n10.1016/j.tins.2009.05.006\n10.1038/nrn3405\n10.1037/h0037368\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0515-12.2012\n10.1007/s00417-002-0519-2\n10.1152/jn.00236.2011\n10.1152/jn.00877.2011\n10.1167/10.7.506\n10.1167/8.14.21\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.12.010\n10.1364/JOSA.43.000495\n10.1016/S0042-6989(96)00216-7\n10.1016/j.visres.2009.08.010\n10.1007/s00221-005-0148-1\n10.1117/1.3083435\n10.1037/0033-2909.85.2.338\n10.1007/BF02458038\n10.1016/0166-2236(83)90026-7\n10.3758/BF03203050\n10.1167/8.14.15\n10.1073/pnas.0709389105\n10.1080/00222895.1996.10544601\n10.1007/s10072-012-1172-0\n10.1097/01.wno.0000223272.86565.74\n10.1136/bjo.84.9.1071\n10.1088/1742-5468/2009/01/P01015"}

We have revealed that local electric conduction in a grain is dominated by both the grain boundary and ferroelectric domain, and is closely related to the applied electric field and the as-grown state of the grain. At lower voltages the electrical conduction is dominated by the grain boundary and is associated with the redistribution of oxygen vacancies in the grain boundary under external electric fields. At higher voltages both the grain boundary and ferroelectric domain are responsible for the electrical conduction of grains, and the electrical conduction gradually extends from the grain boundary into the grain interior due to the extension of the ferroelectric domain towards the grain interior.

The selection is achieved by using sub-millisecond timed control of a piezo-tilt mirror to steer a focused 1064-nm laser spot for optical gradient force switching following analysis of the fluorescence signals from passage of the cell through a series of 532-nm laser beams. In transit through each beam, the fluorescent proteins within the cell undergo conversion to dark states, but the microfluidic chip enables the cell to pass sufficiently slowly that recovery from reversible dark states occurs between beams, thereby enabling irreversible photobleaching to be quantified separately from the reversible dark-state conversion. The microfluidic platform achieves sorting of samples down to sub-millilitre volumes with minimal loss, wherein collected cells remain alive and can subsequently proliferate.

Here, we report a synthesis of piezoelectric (1 - x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 (PMN-PT) nanowire-based nanocomposite with significantly improved performances for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing. With the high piezoelectric constant (d33) and the unique hierarchical structure of the PMN-PT nanowires, the PMN-PT nanowire-based nanocomposite demonstrated an output voltage up to 7.8 V and an output current up to 2.29 \u03bcA (current density of 4.58 \u03bcA/cm(2)); this output voltage is more than double that of other reported piezoelectric nanocomposites, and the output current is at least 6 times greater.

Based on such a mechanism, we first studied the responses of an unpackaged NG to oxygen, H2S and water vapor, and demonstrated its sensitivity to H2S to a level as low as 100 ppm.

Thus, biomechanical analysis of textile devices has to include the impact of strain on stretchability and effective porosity. Prolift(\u00ae) and Prolift + M(\u00ae), developed for tension free conditions, were tested by measuring stretchability and effective porosity applying mechanical strain. For comparison, we used Dynamesh-PR4(\u00ae), which was designed for pelvic floor repair to withstand mechanical strain. Prolift(\u00ae) at rest showed moderate porosity with little stretchability but complete loss of effective porosity at strain of 4.9 N/cm. Prolift + M(\u00ae) revealed an increased porosity at rest, but at strain showed high stretchability, with subsequent loss of effective porosity at strain of 2.5 N/cm. Dynamesh PR4(\u00ae) preserved its high porosity even under strain, but as consequence of limited stretchability. Though in tension free conditions Prolift(\u00ae) and Prolift + M(\u00ae) can be considered as large pore class I meshes, application of mechanical strain rapidly lead to collapse of pores. The loss of porosity at mechanical stress can be prevented by constructions with high structural stability. Assessment of porosity under strain was found helpful to define requirements for pelvic floor devices.

This is because mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of complex samples are limited by their dynamic range for detection-so careful front-end sample preparation, fractionation, and enrichment are crucial to find biologically relevant signals in an extremely complex extracellular environment. Here, we share a very useful and simple front-end surveying methodology-lectin blotting-for proteomic analysis of glycosylation patterns-the most abundant posttranslational modification in extracellular signaling.Lectin blotting is an effective biochemical technique based on lectin-glycan interactions. It is used to detect and characterize carbohydrate epitopes on protein or lipids. Depending on lectin patterns, specific lectins can be used as tags to enrich glycoproteins for further proteomic analysis. In this method, proteins or lipids are resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred electrophoretically to adsorbent membranes such as nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane first. Transferred proteins or lipids are subsequently analyzed by probes including labeled lectins. In this chapter, we provide a detailed methodology of lectin blotting for glycol-proteomic analysis. This method is robust and can be used for complex cell lysates, conditioned media, or human samples to monitor glycosylation pattern following extracellular signal transduction.

Expression issues also can affect selection of antibody candidates from phage libraries, since antibody fragments displayed on phage also are secreted into the E. coli periplasm.

Cytoplasmic expression of cytFkpA improved secretion of functional Fab fragments into the periplasm, exceeding even the benefits from co-expressing Fab fragments with native, FkpA localized in the periplasm.

The immunosensor showed a detection limit of 13.0 nmol L(-1) with excellent specificity, showing no response for different proteins that include another cysteine peptidase that is used as a target to detect Xylella fastidiosa bacterium, responsible for another important citrus disease.

Based on a single CF/ZnO-CdS wire on a polymer substrate, a flexible photodetector was fabricated, which exhibited ultrahigh photon responsivity under illuminations of blue light (1.11 \u00d7 10(5) A/W, 8.99 \u00d7 10(-8) W/cm(2), 480 nm), green light (3.83 \u00d7 10(4) A/W, 4.48 \u00d7 10(-8) W/cm(2), 548 nm), and UV light (1.94 \u00d7 10(5) A/W, 1.59 \u00d7 10(-8) W/cm(2), 372 nm), respectively. The responsivity of this broadband photon sensor was enhanced further by as much as 60% when the device was subjected to a -0.38% compressive strain.

The authors are investigating the development of a piezoelectric composite biomaterial and interbody device design that could generate clinically relevant levels of electrical stimulation to help improve the rate of fusion for these patients. A lumped parameter model of the piezoelectric composite implant was developed based on a model that has been utilized to successfully predict power generation for piezoceramics. Seven variables (fiber material, matrix material, fiber volume fraction, fiber aspect ratio, implant cross-sectional area, implant thickness, and electrical load resistance) were parametrically analyzed to determine their effects on power generation within reasonable implant constraints. Influences of implant geometry and fiber aspect ratio were independent of material parameters. For a cyclic force of constant magnitude, implant thickness was directly and cross-sectional area inversely proportional to power generation potential. Fiber aspect ratios above 30 yielded maximum power generation potential while volume fractions above 15% showed superior performance. This investigation demonstrates the feasibility of using composite piezoelectric biomaterials in medical implants to generate therapeutic levels of direct current electrical stimulation.

{"title": "Snoring detection using a piezo snoring sensor based on hidden Markov models.", "abstract": "This study presents a snoring detection method based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) using a piezo snoring sensor. Snoring is a major symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In most sleep studies, snoring is detected with a microphone. Since these studies analyze the acoustic properties of snoring, they need to acquire data at high sampling rates, so a large amount of data should be processed. Recently, several sleep studies have monitored snoring using a piezo snoring sensor. However, an automatic method for snoring detection using a piezo snoring sensor has not been reported in the literature. This study proposed the HMM-based method to detect snoring using this sensor, which is attached to the neck. The data from 21 patients with OSA were gathered for training and test sets. The short-time Fourier transform and short-time energy were computed so they could be applied to HMMs. The data were classified as snoring, noise and silence according to their HMMs. As a result, the sensitivity and the positive predictivity values were 93.3% and 99.1% for snoring detection, respectively. The results demonstrated that the method produced simple, portable and user-friendly detection tools that provide an alternative to the microphone-based method.", "journal": "Physiological measurement", "date": "2013-04-17", "authors": ["Hyo-KiLee", "JeonLee", "HojoongKim", "Jin-YoungHa", "Kyoung-JoungLee"], "doi": "10.1088/0967-3334/34/5/N41"}

Wherein, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and water with different volume ratio were used as mixed solvents to obtain the solution casting films, P series. In addition, MgCl2\u00b76H2O was comparatively added to prepare PVDF/MgCl2\u00b76H2O hybrid films, P-M series. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) were utilized to study the influence of the water content in the mixed solvents and the hydrated salt on crystallization behavior of PVDF. Further, the morphologic images from scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), as well as the pizoelectirc d33 test also supplies the corresponding evidences. As indicated, the water in the mixed solvent shows different effect on main crystal forms of PVDF. At low water content, the solvents may favor the polar phase (\u03b2- and \u03b3-phase) mainly by hydrogen bonds interactions between PVDF and water, together with dipolar interactions between PVDF and DMF. At high water content, the nonsolvent water will impose confinement effect on polymer chain diffusion and crystal growth which facilitate the formation of \u03b1-phase PVDF. Moreover, magnesium chloride hexahydrate mainly functioned as the nucleation sites for PVDF crystallization. The result of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) implies the content of water or MgCl2\u00b76H2O has little impact on the structure of the long period.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2013-04-17", "authors": ["RuiSong", "GuangmeiXia", "XueqingXing", "LinghaoHe", "QiaolingZhao", "ZhiMa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2013.03.021"}

The oxygen ventilation modes impacted the denitrification performance remarkably, resulting in different nitrate removal efficiencies and biofilm microorganism distribution. The biofilm sludge showed a high resistance to the DO inhibition, mainly due to the co-existing methanotroph being capable of utilizing oxygen perferentially within biofilm, and create an anoxic micro-environment. The denitrification of both nitrate and nitrite by biofilm sludge conformed to the Monod equation, and the maximum specific nitrate utilization rate (k) ranged from 1.55 to 1.78 NO3(-)-N/g VSS-d.

These results were also compared to data obtained from commercial Macro Fiber Composite IDT transducers. In the last phase of this work, damage detection was demonstrated by mounting these nanocomposite sensors and actuators (using a pitch-catch setup) onto an aluminum pipe and plate. Damage was simulated by tightening a band clamp around the pipe and by drilling holes in the plate. A damage index calculation was used to compare results corresponding to different levels of damage applied to the plate (i.e., different drilled hole depths), and good correlation was observed.

{"title": "Early development of hearing in zebrafish.", "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a valuable vertebrate model for human hearing and balance disorders because it combines powerful genetics, excellent embryology, and exceptional in vivo visualization in one organism. In this study, we investigated auditory function of zebrafish at early developmental stages using the microphonic potential method. This is the first study to report ontogeny of response of hair cells in any fish during the first week post fertilization. The right ear of each zebrafish embedded in agarose was linearly stimulated with a glass probe that was driven by a calibrated piezoelectric actuator. Using beveled micropipettes filled with standard fish saline, extracellular microphonic potentials were recorded from hair cells in the inner ear of zebrafish embryos or larvae in response to 20, 50, 100, and 200-Hz stimulation. Saccular hair cells expressing green fluorescent protein of the transgenic zebrafish from 2 to 7\u00a0days post fertilization (dpf) were visualized and quantified using confocal microscopy. The otic vesicles' areas, otoliths' areas, and saccular hair cell count and density increased linearly with age and standard body length. Microphonic responses increased monotonically with stimulus intensity, stimulus frequency, and age of zebrafish. Microphonic threshold at 200\u00a0Hz gradually decreased with zebrafish age. The increases in microphonic response and sensitivity correlate with the increases in number and density of hair cells in the saccule.

The input electrical impedance of the sample is usually measured by using low voltage or current magnitude frequency sweeping signals. In this work, the complex material parameters of piezoceramic samples are determined in the real operating conditions by using the high voltage short impulse excitation signals. The input electrical impedance determined in the impulse mode around thickness extensional vibration mode (TE) and calculated piezoceramic parameters (clamped dielectric permittivity, electromechanical coupling factor, elastic stiffness and piezoelectric constant) are compared to the results obtained by using the low voltage magnitude frequency sweeping signals. When impulse excitation is used, the series resonance frequency is decreased and the input electrical impedance magnitude at series resonance is increased, which means that overall losses included in the piezoceramic parameters are increased. The complex material parameters obtained from the input electrical impedances determined by using the low voltage magnitude sweeping signal and high level short impulse signals are included in the KLM theoretical model describing the piezoceramic sample behaviour around TE mode. Better agreement between measured and theoretically determined current magnitude response around TE mode has been obtained, in the KLM model, when piezoceramic parameters determined by using the impulse signal excitations are included in the modelling.

{"title": "A crossflow filtration system for constant permeate flux membrane fouling characterization.", "abstract": "Membrane fouling is often characterized using a crossflow filtration apparatus. Typically, the transmembrane pressure (TMP) difference is fixed, and the flux is allowed to decline as the membrane fouls and the resistance to mass transfer increases. However, as flux varies, so too does the rate at which foulants are brought to the membrane surface, so the observed fouling behavior is not solely the result of membrane\u2215foulant interactions. Constant flux experiments, where the permeate flux is fixed and the TMP difference varies, minimize such variations in the hydrodynamic conditions at the membrane surface, but constant TMP difference experiments dominate the fouling literature because they are more straightforward to execute than constant flux experiments. Additionally, most industrial water purification membrane installations operate at constant flux rather than at constant TMP. Here, we describe the construction and operation of a constant flux crossflow fouling apparatus. System measurement accuracy was validated by comparison of pure water permeance measurements to values specified by the membrane manufacturer, reported elsewhere, and measured by another technique. Fouling experiments were performed with two membrane\u2215foulant systems: polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes with a soybean oil emulsion foulant and PVDF microfiltration membranes with a polystyrene latex bead suspension foulant.

Gigahertz-frequency longitudinal and shear acoustic dynamics in glycerol and DC704 studied by time-domain Brillouin scattering.", "abstract": "This paper presents and discusses the temperature and frequency dependence of the longitudinal and shear viscoelastic response at MHz and GHz frequencies of the intermediate glass former glycerol and the fragile glass former tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-trisiloxane (DC704). Measurements were performed using the recently developed time-domain Brillouin scattering technique, in which acoustic waves are generated optically, propagated through nm thin liquid layers of different thicknesses, and detected optically after transmission into a transparent detection substrate. This allows for a determination of the frequency dependence of the speed of sound and the sound-wave attenuation. When the data are converted into mechanical moduli, a linear relationship between longitudinal and shear acoustic moduli is revealed, which is consistent with the generalized Cauchy relation. In glycerol, the temperature dependence of the shear acoustic relaxation time agrees well with literature data for dielectric measurements. In DC704, combining the new data with data from measurements obtained previously by piezo-ceramic transducers yields figures showing the longitudinal and shear sound velocities at frequencies from mHz to GHz over an extended range of temperatures. The shoving model's prediction for the relaxation time's temperature dependence is fairly well obeyed for both liquids as demonstrated from a plot with no adjustable parameters. Finally, we show that for both liquids the instantaneous shear modulus follows an exponential temperature dependence to a good approximation, as predicted by Granato's interstitialcy model.", "journal": "The Journal of chemical physics", "date": "2013-04-06", "authors": ["ChristophKlieber", "TinaHecksher", "ThomasPezeril", "Darius HTorchinsky", "Jeppe CDyre", "Keith ANelson"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4789948"}

The primary objective of the study was to show if movements detected during sleep by the BMDS were indeed related to breathing. This medical device is not intended to measure the respiratory rate, but in a second step, it will be able to detect pathological central apnea in adults. One hundred and sixty-nine adult patients underwent a full polysomnography in which each respiratory movement was recorded concomitantly through the BMDS. Curves obtained by the BMDS were compared to those of thoracic movements recorded by classical piezoelectric belts and of pressure obtained with nasal cannula. The correlations between the PIR sensors were highly indicative of respiratory movement detection. Since PIR sensors are sensitive only to the exemplification of the rib cage, they did not detect obstructive apnea. Unfortunately, only a few patients in the studied population had a central apnea. Moreover as our sleep laboratory was equipped only with piezoelectric bands, the central apnea respiratory effort data are not a validated signal to be used during sleep recordings. The data recorded by the BMDS demonstrate the ability of the PIR technology to detect respiratory movements in adults. The concept is practical, inexpensive and safe for the patient. Further studies with respiratory inductive plethysmography are needed to investigate the potential of BMDS to detect central apneas.", "journal": "Journal of clinical monitoring and computing", "date": "2013-04-04", "authors": ["VHers", "DCorbugy", "IJoslet", "PHermant", "JDemarteau", "BDelhougne", "GVandermoten", "J PHermanne"], "doi": "10.1007/s10877-013-9457-2\n10.1109/10.594896\n10.1023/A:1011424732717\n10.1109/TBME.2002.807327\n10.1023/A:1016309913890\n10.1136/emj.16.1.26\n10.1007/s11517-006-0091-8\n10.1007/s11517-007-0298-3\n10.1109/MEMB.2006.1636352\n10.1164/rccm.2105085\n10.1183/09031936.04.00072304"}

Particularly, active repairs, based on the converse piezoelectric effect, can increase the life of a structure by reducing the crack opening. A deep characterization of the electromechanical behavior of delaminated composite structures, actively repaired by piezoelectric patches, can be achieved by considering the adhesive layer between the host structure and the repair and by taking into account the frictional contact between the crack surfaces. In this paper, Boundary Element (BE) analyses performed on delaminated composite structures repaired by active piezoelectric patches are presented. A two-dimensional boundary integral formulation for piezoelectric solids based on the multi-domain technique to model the composite host damaged structures and the bonded piezoelectric patches is employed.

The patterns could be deposited onto the substrate after the liquid evaporated. By controlling the distribution of the SSAW field, metallic nanowires were assembled into different patterns including parallel and perpendicular arrays. The spacing of the nanowire arrays could be tuned by controlling the frequency of the surface acoustic waves. Additionally, we observed 3D spark-shaped nanowire patterns in the SSAW field.

{"title": "Piezosurgery for the lingual split technique in mandibular third molar removal: a suggestion.", "abstract": "The lingual split technique is a surgical procedure for extraction of impacted mandibular third molar throughout a lingual approach. The main disadvantage of this technique is the high rate of temporary lingual nerve injury mainly because of the trauma induced by the lingual flap retraction. The purpose of this paper is to suggest the use of piezosurgery in performing the lingual cortical plate osteotomy of the third molar alveolar process.\nSurgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and it lasted approximately 60 minutes. After the buccal and lingual full-thickness flaps were incised and elevated, a piezosurgical device was used for osteotomy. A well-defined bony window was then removed, and it allowed the entire tooth was extracted in a lingual direction. The patient did not show any neurological postoperative complication. Lingual and inferior alveolar nerve functionality was normal before as well as after surgery.\nThe use of piezoelectric surgery seems to be a good option in removing lower third molars when a lingual access is clearly indicated. The only disadvantage of this technique can be represented by an operating time lengthening possibly because of a lower power cut of the piezoelectric device, to the high mineralization of the mandibular cortical bone and to the use of inserts with a low degree of sharpening.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2013-03-26", "authors": ["RobertoPippi", "RobertoAlvaro"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e31826463f7"}
{"title": "Microfabricated 1-3 composite acoustic matching layers for 15 MHz transducers.", "abstract": "Medical ultrasound transducers require matching layers to couple energy from the piezoelectric ceramic into the tissue. Composites of type 0-3 are often used to obtain the desired acoustic impedances, but they introduce challenges at high frequencies, i.e. non-uniformity, attenuation, and dispersion. This paper presents novel acoustic matching layers made as silicon-polymer 1-3 composites, fabricated by deep reactive ion etch (DRIE). This fabrication method is well-established for high-volume production in the microtechnology industry. First estimates for the acoustic properties were found from the iso-strain theory, while the Finite Element Method (FEM) was employed for more accurate modeling. The composites were used as single matching layers in 15 MHz ultrasound transducers. Acoustic properties of the composite were estimated by fitting the electrical impedance measurements to the Mason model. Five composites were fabricated. All had period 16 \u03bcm, while the silicon width was varied to cover silicon volume fractions between 0.17 and 0.28. Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafers were used to get a controlled etch stop against the buried oxide layer at a defined depth, resulting in composites with thickness 83 \u03bcm. A slight tapering of the silicon side walls was observed; their widths were 0.9 \u03bcm smaller at the bottom than at the top, corresponding to a tapering angle of 0.3\u00b0. Acoustic parameters estimated from electrical impedance measurements were lower than predicted from the iso-strain model, but fitted within 5% to FEM simulations. The deviation was explained by dispersion caused by the finite dimensions of the composite and by the tapered walls. Pulse-echo measurements on a transducer with silicon volume fraction 0.17 showed a two-way -6 dB relative bandwidth of 50%. The pulse-echo measurements agreed with predictions from the Mason model when using material parameter values estimated from electrical impedance measurements. The results show the feasibility of the fabrication method and the theoretical description. A next step would be to include these composites as one of several layers in an acoustic matching layer stack.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-03-26", "authors": ["TungManh", "Geir UriJensen", "Tonni FJohansen", "LarsHoff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.02.010"}

The electrical conductivity of the composites was greatly improved by doping with graphene sheets. The percolation threshold of such composite was determined to be 0.31 vol.%, being much smaller than that of the composites prepared via blending reduced graphene sheets with polymer matrix. This is attributed to the large aspect ratio of the SRG sheets and their uniform dispersion in the polymer matrix. The dielectric constant of PVDF showed a marked increase from 7 to about 105 with only 0.5 vol.% loading of SRG content. Like the other conductor-insulator systems, the AC conductivity of the system also obeyed the universal dynamic response. In addition, the SRG/PVDF composite shows a much stronger nonlinear conduction behavior than carbon nanotube/nanofiber based polymer composite, owing to intense Zener tunneling between the SRG sheets.

The pressure sensors can be mass producible using standard lithography process, with excellent control of film uniformity and thickness down to one micrometer.

The average sensitivity of the PVDF sensor was found to be four times higher (99 \u03bcV/mmHg) than commercial pressure sensor while the PVDF sensor (0.26 s) had fivefold shorter response time than commercial pressure sensor (1.30 s), making the PVDF sensors highly suitable for real-time pressure measurements using catheters.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2013-03-23", "authors": ["TusharSharma", "KevinAroom", "SahilNaik", "BrijeshGill", "John X JZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-012-0708-z"}

After successful isolation of embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, there are many methods for producing chimeras, including co-culture with the embryos, microinjection of the ES cells into pre-implantation embryos, and use of tetraploid embryos to generate the full ES-derived transgenic mice. Here, we aimed to generate the transgenic ES cell line, compare the production efficiency of chimeric mice and its proportion to yield the male chimeric mice by microinjected ES cells into 4- to 8-cell and blastocysts embryos with the application of Piezo-Micromanipulator (PMM), and trace the fate of the injected ES cells.\nWe successfully generated a transgenic ES cell line and proved that this cell line still maintained pluripotency. Although we achieved a satisfactory chimeric mice rate, there was no significant difference in the production of chimeric mice using the two different methods, but the proportion of the male chimeric mice in the 4- to 8-cell group was higher than in the blastocyst group. We also found that there was no tendency for ES cells to aggregate into the inner cell mass using in vitro culture of the chimeric embryos, indicating that they aggregated randomly.\nThese results showed that the PMM method is a convenient way to generate chimeric mice and microinjection of ES cells into 4- to 8-cell embryos can increase the chance of yielding male chimeras compared to the blastocyst injection.

At present, the copolymer of PVDF with trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) is used, but the stack integrity and the limited thermal stability of its remanent polarization hamper large-scale integration.

The remanent polarization and coercive field are comparable to those of the copolymer.

{"title": "Colorimetric test-systems for creatinine detection based on composite molecularly imprinted polymer membranes.", "abstract": "An easy-to-use colorimetric test-system for the efficient detection of creatinine in aqueous samples was developed. The test-system is based on composite molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) membranes with artificial receptor sites capable of creatinine recognition. A thin MIP layer was created on the surface of microfiltration polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes using method of photo-initiated grafting polymerization. The MIP layer was obtained by co-polymerization of a functional monomer (e.g. 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid, itaconic acid or methacrylic acid) with N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker. The choice of the functional monomer was based on the results of computational modeling. The creatinine-selective composite MIP membranes were used for measuring creatinine in aqueous samples.

Single rectangle pulse was applied to piezoelectric device on inkjet microchip for the ejection of each picoliter droplet, and it was controlled by a computer. The voltage and width of driving pulse for the inkjet were optimized to make reproducible ejection of the solvent with low viscosity. The volume of each droplet was about 600 pl, and a trigger of 10 droplets was selected as the best inlet mode taking relative standard derivation of the droplets into consideration. The target substrate used with high voltage to form ionization was graphite, after several attempts with some materials. High-speed camera was used to capture the breaking-up process of a droplet. The distance between the inkjet nozzle and the tip was set at 2 cm to avoid short circuit. The influences on the mass intensity of the diameter of the tip, the volume and the concentration of the sample were examined. The tip with a small diameter performed greater intensity, and the limit of detection decreased, whereas the small volume of liquid played high ionization efficiency.

{"title": "Glancing angle deposited nanostructured film Fabry-Perot etalons for optical detection of ultrasound.", "abstract": "In this paper a new class of optical Fabry-Perot-based ultrasound detectors using low acoustic impedance glancing angle deposited (GLAD) films is demonstrated. GLAD is a single-step physical vapor-deposition (PVD) technique used to fabricate porous nanostructured thin films. Using titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), a transparent semiconductor with a high refractive index (n = 2.4), the GLAD technique can be employed to fabricate samples with tailored nano-porosity, refractive index periodicities, and high Q-factor reflectance spectra. The average acoustic impedance of the porous films is lower than bulk materials which will improve acoustic coupling, especially for high acoustic frequencies. For this work, two filters with high reflection in the C-band range and high transparency in the visible range (~80%) using GLAD films were fabricated. A 23 \u00b5m Parylene C layer was sandwiched between these two GLAD films in order to form a GLAD Fabry Perot Interferometer (GLAD-FPI). A high speed tunable continuous wavelength C-band laser was focused at the FPI and the reflection was measured using a high speed photodiode. The ultrasound pressure modulated the optical thickness of the FPI and hence its reflectivity. The fabricated sensor was tested using a 10 MHz unfocused transducer. The ultrasound transducer was calibrated using a hydrophone. The minimum detectable acoustic pressure was measured as 80 \u00b1 20 Pa and the -3dB bandwidth was measured to be 18 MHz. This ultra-sensitive sensor can be an alternative to piezoelectric ultrasound transducers for any techniques in which ultrasound waves need to be detected including ultrasonic and photoacoustic imaging modalities.

{"title": "A Fully Actuated Robotic Assistant for MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy and Brachytherapy.", "abstract": "Intra-operative medical imaging enables incorporation of human experience and intelligence in a controlled, closed-loop fashion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ideal modality for surgical guidance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, with its ability to perform high resolution, real-time, high soft tissue contrast imaging without ionizing radiation. However, for most current image-guided approaches only static pre-operative images are accessible for guidance, which are unable to provide updated information during a surgical procedure. The high magnetic field, electrical interference, and limited access of closed-bore MRI render great challenges to developing robotic systems that can perform inside a diagnostic high-field MRI while obtaining interactively updated MR images. To overcome these limitations, we are developing a piezoelectrically actuated robotic assistant for actuated percutaneous prostate interventions under real-time MRI guidance. Utilizing a modular design, the system enables coherent and straight forward workflow for various percutaneous interventions, including prostate biopsy sampling and brachytherapy seed placement, using various needle driver configurations. The unified workflow compromises: 1) system hardware and software initialization, 2) fiducial frame registration, 3) target selection and motion planning, 4) moving to the target and performing the intervention (e.g. taking a biopsy sample) under live imaging, and 5) visualization and verification. Phantom experiments of prostate biopsy and brachytherapy were executed under MRI-guidance to evaluate the feasibility of the workflow.

{"title": "Numerical modeling, calibration, and validation of an ultrasonic separator.", "abstract": "Our overall goal is to apply acoustic separation technology for the recovery of valuable particulate matter from wastewater in industry. Such large-scale separator systems require detailed design and evaluation to optimize the system performance at the earliest stage possible. Numerical models can facilitate and accelerate the design of this application; therefore, a finite element (FE) model of an ultrasonic particle separator is a prerequisite. In our application, the particle separator consists of a glass resonator chamber with a piezoelectric transducer attached to the glass by means of epoxy adhesive. Separation occurs most efficiently when the system is operated at its main eigenfrequency. The goal of the paper is to calibrate and validate a model of a demonstrator ultrasonic separator, preserving known physical parameters and estimating the remaining unknown or less-certain parameters to allow extrapolation of the model beyond the measured system. A two-step approach was applied to obtain a validated model of the separator. The first step involved the calibration of the piezoelectric transducer. The second step, the subject of this paper, involves the calibration and validation of the entire separator using nonlinear optimization techniques. The results show that the approach lead to a fully calibrated 2-D model of the empty separator, which was validated with experiments on a filled separator chamber.

{"title": "Precise neural stimulation in the retina using focused ultrasound.", "abstract": "Focused ultrasound is a promising noninvasive technology for neural stimulation. Here we use the isolated salamander retina to characterize the effect of ultrasound on an intact neural circuit and compared these effects with those of visual stimulation of the same retinal ganglion cells. Ultrasound stimuli at an acoustic frequency of 43 MHz and a focal spot diameter of 90 \u03bcm delivered from a piezoelectric transducer evoked stable responses with a temporal precision equal to strong visual responses but with shorter latency. By presenting ultrasound and visual stimulation together, we found that ultrasonic stimulation rapidly modulated visual sensitivity but did not change visual temporal filtering. By combining pharmacology with ultrasound stimulation, we found that ultrasound did not directly activate retinal ganglion cells but did in part activate interneurons beyond photoreceptors. These results suggest that, under conditions of strong localized stimulation, timing variability is largely influenced by cells beyond photoreceptors. We conclude that ultrasonic stimulation is an effective and spatiotemporally precise method to activate the retina. Because the retina is the most accessible part of the CNS in vivo, ultrasonic stimulation may have diagnostic potential to probe remaining retinal function in cases of photoreceptor degeneration, and therapeutic potential for use in a retinal prosthesis.

In order to detect breast tumors located a few centimeter deep in tissue, a sensitive ultrasound detector is of crucial importance for photoacoustic mammography. Further, because the expected photoacoustic frequency bandwidth (a few MHz to tens of kHz) is inversely proportional to the dimensions of light absorbing structures (0.5-10+ mm), proper choices of materials and their geometries and proper considerations in design have to be made to implement optimal photoacoustic detectors. In this study, we design and evaluate a specialized ultrasound detector for photoacoustic mammography.\nBased on the required detector sensitivity and its frequency response, a selection of active material and matching layers and their geometries is made leading to functional detector models. By iteration between simulation of detector performances, fabrication and experimental characterization of functional models an optimized implementation is made and evaluated. For computer simulation, we use 1D Krimholtz-Leedom-Matthaei and 3D finite-element based models.\nThe experimental results of the designed first and second functional detectors matched with the simulations. In subsequent bare piezoelectric samples the effect of lateral resonances was addressed and their influence minimized by subdicing the samples.

One configuration of interest is a spatially distributed array of fixed piezoelectric devices. Typical operation consists of recording signals from all transmit-receive pairs and subtracting pre-recorded baselines to detect changes, possibly due to damage or other effects. While techniques such as delay-and-sum imaging as applied to differential signals are both simple and capable of detecting flaws, their performance is limited, particularly when there are multiple damage sites. Here a very different approach to imaging is considered that exploits the expected sparsity of structural damage; i.e., the structure is mostly damage-free. Differential signals are decomposed into a sparse linear combination of location-based components, which are pre-computed from a simple propagation model. The sparse reconstruction techniques of basis pursuit denoising and orthogonal matching pursuit are applied to achieve this decomposition, and a hybrid reconstruction method is also proposed and evaluated.

Also, the large number of cells required to be clinically useful is currently a hurdle to using materials-based (stiffness, chemistry, nanotopography, etc.) culture substrates. Here we give a first demonstration of using nanoscale sinusoidal mechanotransductive protocols (10-14 nm displacements at 1 kHz frequency), \"nanokicking\", to promote osteoblastogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cell cultures.

A combination of immunofluorescence, PCR, and microarray has then been used to demonstrate osteoblastogenesis, and the arrays implicate RhoA as central to osteoblastic differentiation in agreement with materials-based strategies.

In contrast to 3\u00d7 MF theoretical cumulative SP removal percentages of 68, 90, and 97% after 1, 2, and 3 stages, respectively, the 3\u00d7 Isoflux MF process removed only 39.5, 58.4, and 70.2% of SP after 1, 2, and 3 stages, respectively. Previous research has been published that provides the skim milk SP removal capacities of 3-stage, 3\u00d7 0.1\u03bcm ceramic Membralox (Pall Corp., Cortland, NY) uniform transmembrane pressure (UTP), 0.1\u03bcm ceramic Membralox graded permeability (GP), and 0.3\u03bcm polymeric polyvinylidene fluoride spiral-wound (PVDF-SW) MF systems (Parker-Hannifin, Process Advanced Filtration Division, Tell City, IN) at 50\u00b0C. No difference in cumulative SP removal percentage after 3 stages was detected between the Isoflux and previously published PVDF-SW values (70.3%), but SP removal was lower than published GP (96.5%) and UTP (98.3%) values. To remove 95% of SP from 1,000kg of skim milk in 12h it would take 7, 3, 3, and 7 stages with 6.86, 1.91, 2.82, and 17.98m(2) of membrane surface area for the Isoflux, GP, UTP, and PVDF-SW systems, respectively. The MF systems requiring more stages would produce additional permeate at lower protein concentrations. The ceramic MF systems requiring more surface area would incur higher capital costs. The authors hypothesize that SP removal with the Isoflux membranes was lower than theoretical for the following reasons: a range of membrane pore sizes existed (i.e., some pores were too small to pass SP), the selective layer modification and reverse flow conditions at the membrane outlet combined to reduce the effective membrane surface area, and the geometric shape of the Isoflux flow channels promoted early fouling of the membrane and rejection of SP by the foulant.", "journal": "Journal of dairy science", "date": "2013-02-19", "authors": ["Michael CAdams", "David MBarbano"], "doi": "10.3168/jds.2012-6007"}

One batch (620 kg) was microfiltered (MF) using pilot-scale ceramic uniform transmembrane pressure Membralox membranes (model EP1940GL0.1 \u03bcA, 0.1-\u03bcm alumina; Pall Corp., East Hills, NY) to produce retentate and permeate. The permeate from the MF uniform transmembrane pressure was casein-free skim milk (CFSM). The CFSM was MF using polymeric spiral-wound (SW) membranes (model FG7838-OS0x-S, 0.3 \u03bcm; Parker-Hannifin Corp., Process Advanced Filtration Division, Tell City, IN) at a concentration factor of 3\u00d7 and temperature of 50\u00b0C. Following the processing of CFSM, the second batch of skim milk (1,105 kg) was processed using the same polymeric membranes to determine how casein content in the feed material for MF with polymeric membranes affects the performance of the system. There was little resistance to passage of milk serum proteins (SP) through a 0.3-\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) SW membrane at 50\u00b0C and no detectable increase in hydraulic resistance of the membrane when processing CFSM. Therefore, milk SP contributed little, if any, to fouling of the PVDF membrane. In contrast, when processing skim milk containing a normal concentration of casein, the flux was much lower than when processing CFSM (17.2 vs. 80.2 kg/m(2) per hour, respectively) and the removal of SP from skim milk with a single-pass 3\u00d7 bleed-and-feed MF system was also much lower than from CFSM (35.2 vs. 59.5% removal, respectively). Thus, when processing skim milk with a PVDF SW membrane, casein was the major protein foulant that increased hydraulic resistance and reduced passage of SP through the membrane.", "journal": "Journal of dairy science", "date": "2013-02-19", "authors": ["JustynaZulewska", "David MBarbano"], "doi": "10.3168/jds.2012-6032"}

The piezosurgery medical device allows the efficient cutting of mineralized tissues with minimal trauma to soft tissues. Piezoelectric osteotome has found its role in surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME), a procedure well established to correct transverse maxillary discrepancies. The advantages include minimal risk to critical anatomic structures. The purpose of this clinical comparative study (CIS 2007-237-M) was to present the advantages of the piezoelectric cut as a minimally invasive device in surgically assisted, rapid maxillary expansion by protecting the maxillary sinus mucosal lining.\nThirty patients (18 females and 12 males) at the age of 18 to 54 underwent a surgically assisted palatal expansion of the maxilla with a combined orthodontic and surgical approach. The patients were randomly divided into two separate treatment groups. While Group 1 received conventional surgery using an oscillating saw, Group 2 was treated with piezosurgery. The following parameters were examined: blood pressure, blood values, required medication, bleeding level in the maxillary sinus, duration of inpatient stay, duration of surgery and height of body temperature.\nThe results displayed no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding laboratory blood values and inpatient stay. The duration of surgery revealed a significant discrepancy. Deploying piezosurgery took the surgeon an average of 10 minutes longer than working with a conventional-saw technique. However, the observation of the bleeding level in the paranasal sinus presented a major and statistically significant advantage of piezosurgery: on average the bleeding level was one category above the one of the remaining patients.\nThis method of piezoelectric surgery with all its advantages is going to replace many conventional operating procedures in oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nCIS 2007-237-M.", "journal": "Trials", "date": "2013-02-19", "authors": ["MajeedRana", "Nils-ClaudiusGellrich", "MadihaRana", "JozsefPiffk\u00f3", "WolfgangKater"], "doi": "10.1186/1745-6215-14-49"}

The trend towards the hexagonal monolayer (h-BN) in the limit of large tube radius R is explored for a variety of properties related to the vibrational spectrum: vibration frequencies, infrared intensities, oscillator strengths, and vibration contributions to the polarizability tensor. The (n,0) family is investigated in the range from n = 6 (24 atoms in the unit cell and tube radius R = 2.5 \u00c5) to n = 60 (240 atoms in the cell and R = 24.0 \u00c5).

{"title": "Microcontact printing and microspotting as methods for direct protein patterning on plasma deposited polyethylene oxide: application to stem cell patterning.", "abstract": "Two methods for protein patterning on antifouling surfaces have been applied to analyze the density and bioactivity of the proteins after deposition. Microcontact printing has been used as a technique to transfer fibronectin through conformal contact, while piezoelectric deposition has been employed as a non-contact technique for producing arrays of fibronectin (FN). Plasma deposited polyethylene oxide-like (PEO-like) films have been used as non-fouling background to achieve the bioadhesive/biorepellent surface contrast. Both patterning methods allow the direct fabrication of protein arrays on a non-fouling substrate, and the subsequent formation of a pattern of stem cells by cell attachment on the arrayed substrates. Microcontact printing produced fully packed homogeneous fibronectin patterns, much denser than microspotted patterns. Both printing and spotting technologies generated functional protein arrays, their bioactivity being primarily modulated by the density of the deposited protein layer. Optimization of the FN parameters used for deposition has lead to the achievement of high-quality microarrays with large population of neural stem cells immobilized in the patterns in serum-free conditions, where cells exhibit a more homogeneous starting population and factors influencing fate decisions can be more easily tracked. The immunorecognition of fibronectin targeted antibodies, as well as the cell density, increase with the protein density up to a saturation point.

They are involved in nausea and vomiting and their antagonists are used clinically as antiemetic drugs. We previously reported the development of a novel pyrrole analog of etomidate, (R)-ethyl 1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylate (carboetomidate), which retains etomidate's desirable anesthetic and hemodynamic properties, but lacks its potent inhibitory effect on adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated steroid synthesis. Also in contrast to etomidate, carboetomidate potently inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT(3) receptors are highly homologous, we hypothesized that carboetomidate might also potently inhibit 5-HT(3) receptors with potentially important implications for the drug's emetogenic activity. In the current studies, we investigated and compared modulation of 5-HT(3A) receptors by carboetomidate and etomidate.\n5-HT(3) receptors were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Drugs were applied with a multichannel superfusion pipette coupled to piezoelectric elements, and currents were recorded from cells in either the whole-cell or excised outside-out patch configuration of patch-clamp recordings.\nCarboetomidate and etomidate inhibited integrated 5-HT(3A) receptor-mediated currents with respective half-inhibitory concentrations of 1.9 \u03bcM (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-2.7 \u03bcM) and 25 \u03bcM (95% CI = 17-37 \u03bcM). These values may be compared with respective hypnotic concentrations of 5.4 and 2.3 \u00b5M. This inhibition reflected hypnotic effects on peak current amplitudes and desensitization rates. Half-inhibitory concentrations for reducing peak current amplitudes were 34 \u03bcM (95% CI = 24-48 \u00b5M) for carboetomidate and 171 \u03bcM (95% CI = 128-228 \u00b5M) for etomidate. Half-inhibitory concentrations for reducing the desensitization time constant were 3.5 \u03bcM (95% CI = 2.4-5.1 \u00b5M) for carboetomidate and 36 \u03bcM (95% CI = 21-59 \u00b5M) for etomidate.\nIn contrast to etomidate, carboetomidate inhibits 5-HT(3A) receptor-mediated currents at hypnotic concentrations. This inhibition is primarily the result of enhancing the rate of desensitization.

{"title": "Non-volatile electrically-driven repeatable magnetization reversal with no applied magnetic field.", "abstract": "Repeatable magnetization reversal under purely electrical control remains the outstanding goal in magnetoelectrics. Here we use magnetic force microscopy to study a commercially manufactured multilayer capacitor that displays strain-mediated coupling between magnetostrictive Ni electrodes and piezoelectric BaTiO(3)-based dielectric layers. In an electrode exposed by polishing approximately normal to the layers, we find a perpendicularly magnetized feature that exhibits non-volatile electrically driven repeatable magnetization reversal with no applied magnetic field. Using micromagnetic modelling, we interpret this nominally full magnetization reversal in terms of a dynamic precession that is triggered by strain from voltage-driven ferroelectric switching that is fast and reversible. The anisotropy field responsible for the perpendicular magnetization is reversed by the electrically driven magnetic switching, which is, therefore, repeatable.

The BT-HBP hybrid nanofiller were prepared by a solution polymerization of diaminobenzoic acid on the surface of amino-funcationalized BT nanoparticles.

The strain relaxes with the same nanosecond time dependence as the interband relaxation of excited charge carriers. The magnitude of the strain and its temporal correlation with excited carriers indicate that an electronic mechanism, rather than thermal effects, is responsible for the lattice expansion.

Microscale mechanical motion is typically actuated with other mechanisms ranging from electrostatic interaction, thermal expansion, and piezoelectricity to more exotic types including shape memory, electrochemical reaction, and thermal responsivity of polymers. These mechanisms typically offer either large-amplitude or high-speed actuation, but not both. In this work we demonstrate the working principle of a microscale solid engine (\u03bcSE) based on the phase transition of VO2 at 68 \u00b0C with large transformation strain (up to 2%), analogous to the steam engine invoking large volume change in a liquid-vapor phase transition. Compared to polycrystal thin films, single-crystal VO2 nanobeam-based bimorphs deliver higher performance of actuation both with high amplitude (greater than bimorph length) and at high speed (greater than 4 kHz in air and greater than 60 Hz in water). The energy efficiency of the devices is calculated to be equivalent to thermoelectrics with figure of merit ZT = 2 at the working temperatures, and much higher than other bimorph actuators. The bimorph \u03bcSE can be easily scaled down to the nanoscale, and operates with high stability in near-room-temperature, ambient, or aqueous conditions.

Despite its potential as a powerful test bed for strain-related physical phenomena and strain-driven electronic, magnetic, and optical technologies, detailed studies on the efficiency and uniformity of piezoelectric strain transfer are scarce. Here, we demonstrate that full and uniform piezoelectric strain transfer to epitaxial films is not limited to systems with small lattice mismatch or limited film thickness. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of 100\u00a0nm thick CoFe(2)O(4) and La(2/3)Sr(1/3)MnO(3) epitaxial films on piezoelectric 0.72Pb(Mg(1/3)Nb(2/3))O(3)-0.28PbTiO(3) substrates (+4.3% and -3.8% lattice mismatch) indicate that misfit dislocations near the interface do not hamper the transfer of piezoelectric strain. Instead, the epitaxial magnetic oxide films and PMN-PT substrates are strained coherently and their lattice parameters change linearly as a function of applied electric field when their remnant growth-induced strain state is negligible. As a result, ferromagnetic properties such as the coercive field, saturation magnetization, and Curie temperature can be reversibly tuned by electrical means.

The dispersion of the SWNTs in solvents is evaluated by dynamic light scattering. The dispersion of SWNTs in polymers evaluated by a light optical microscope (LOM) generally agrees with the HSP prediction.

The PS/PVDF blends have a wide window of cocontinuity (ca. 30-80 vol % in terms of the volume fraction of PS component (v(PS))). The selective localization of CB nanoparticles is achieved by using the masterbatch process during melt mixing. For the volume ratio PS/PVDF 1/1 and the volume fraction of CB nanoparticles (v(CB)) below but close to the percolation threshold (v(c)(CB)), the selective localization of CB nanoparticles in PVDF phase produces higher dielectric constant (\u03b5) than that in PS phase, whereas the \u03b5 of the ternary mixtures without selective localization of fillers is in the middle. For the volume ratios PS/PVDF 1/2 and 2/1, the selective location of CB nanoparticles in different phases can be used to easily tune the system from conductive to insulating or inverse, which might have potential applications in industry. The fillers are found to be \"fixed\" in the masterbatch of PS or PVDF component and there is no migration of the fillers to another phase occurring during the further mixing process for the mixing time up to 30 min.

Applied loads directly affect waves propagating between array elements because of dimensional changes and the acoustoelastic effect. Resulting changes in phase velocity depend upon the propagation direction as well as the Lamb wave mode and frequency. This paper shows from numerical solutions of the acoustoelastic wave equation for an isotropic plate that it is possible to decouple the effects of a homogeneous biaxial stress into its two principal components. As a consequence of both this decoupling and material isotropy, the acoustoelastic response of a specific mode and frequency is described by only two constants, which can be determined from a uniaxial loading experiment. Using this formulation, a method is developed and verified via simulations to estimate an arbitrary biaxial load from phase velocity changes measured along multiple directions of propagation. Results from uniaxial loading experiments on two different plates further demonstrate the efficacy of the method. It is also shown that opening fatigue cracks may significantly degrade results by interfering with Lamb wave direct arrivals, but that this degradation can be mitigated by using a reduced set of data from unaffected paths of propagation.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2013-02-01", "authors": ["FanShi", "Jennifer EMichaels", "Sang JunLee"], "doi": "10.1121/1.4773867"}

When the device is subjected to an external strain, a piezopotential is created in the micro/nanowire, which tunes the effective heights of the Schottky barriers at the local contacts, consequently increasing the sensitivity and signal level of the sensors. Furthermore, the strain-produced piezopotential along the ZnO micro/nanowire will lead to a nonuniform distribution of the target molecules near the micro/nanowire surface owing to electrostatic interaction, which will make the sensor proactive to detect the target molecules even at extremely low overall concentration, which naturally improves the sensitivity and lowers the detection limit.

The experimental component of the presented work focuses on the characterization of an elastically constrained MFC bimorph propulsor for thrust generation in quiescent water as well as the development of a robotic fish prototype combining a microcontroller and a printed-circuit-board amplifier to generate high actuation voltage for untethered locomotion.

In-air and underwater experiments are performed to verify the incorporation of hydrodynamic effects in the linear actuation regime. For electroelastically nonlinear actuation levels, experimentally obtained underwater vibration response is coupled with the elongated-body theory to predict the thrust output.

However, up to date, the external quantum efficiency of UV LED based on ZnO nanostructures has been limited by a lack of efficient methods to achieve a balance between electron contributed current and hole contributed current that reduces the nonradiative recombination at interface. Here we demonstrate that the piezo-phototronic effect can largely enhance the efficiency of a hybridized inorganic/organic LED made of a ZnO nanowire/p-polymer structure, by trimming the electron current to match the hole current and increasing the localized hole density near the interface through a carrier channel created by piezoelectric polarization charges on the ZnO side. The external efficiency of the hybrid LED was enhanced by at least a factor of 2 after applying a proper strain, reaching 5.92%.

This eliminates the need for a subcutaneous microphone, which is susceptible to interference by ambient noises. Study of the vibrational characteristics of the human ossicles provides valuable information for determining the site of maximum ossicular motion that would be optimal for attachment of the sensor portion of the prosthesis. In this study, vibrational responses at seven locations on the middle-ear ossicles (i.e., the malleus head, 4 different points on the incus body, middle of the incus long process, tip of the incus long process) in human temporal bones (n = 6) were measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer. The measurements were repeated after separating the incudostapedial joint (ISJ). Measured displacement at each location was normalized with the sound pressure level near the tympanic membrane (TM) for representation in the form of a displacement transfer function (DTF). The normalized squared sum of the DTFs (NSSDTF) was then calculated as a measure of vibration motion through a specific frequency range at the considered sites. The relatively large NSSDTF was observed at the sites on the superior part of the malleus head (MH), on the lateral part of the incus body (IBL), and on the superior part of the incus body near the incudomalleal joint (IBS1) for the frequency ranges of 1-4 kHz and 1-9 kHz, regardless of the condition of the ISJ. This indicates that maximum vibrational motion of the middle-ear is deliverable to the piezoelectric transducer of totally implantable devices through these sites.

{"title": "A comparative study on three different transducers for the measurement of nonlinear solitary waves.", "abstract": "In the last decade there has been an increasing interest in the use of highly- and weakly- nonlinear solitary waves in engineering and physics. Nonlinear solitary waves can form and travel in nonlinear systems such as one-dimensional chains of particles, where they are conventionally generated by the mechanical impact of a striker and are measured either by using thin transducers embedded in between two half-particles or by a force sensor placed at the chain's base. These waves have a constant spatial wavelength and their speed, amplitude, and duration can be tuned by modifying the particles' material or size, or the velocity of the striker. In this paper we propose two alternative sensing configurations for the measurements of solitary waves propagating in a chain of spherical particles. One configuration uses piezo rods placed in the chain while the other exploits the magnetostrictive property of ferromagnetic materials. The accuracy of these two sensing systems on the measurement of the solitary wave's characteristics is assessed by comparing experimental data to the numerical prediction of a discrete particle model and to the experimental measurements obtained by means of a conventional transducer. The results show very good agreement and the advantages and limitations of the new sensors are discussed.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2013-01-22", "authors": ["XiangleiNi", "LuyaoCai", "PiervincenzoRizzo"], "doi": "10.3390/s130101231\n10.1007/s11340-011-9544-6"}

To overcome these drawbacks, we performed a sandwich ELISA on a microchip. The microchip was made of cyclic olefin copolymer with 4 straight microchannels. For the construction of the sandwich ELISA for interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), we used a piezoelectric inkjet printing system for the deposition and fixation of the 1st anti-IL-6 antibody or 1st anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody on the surface of the each microchannel. After the infusion of 2 \u00b5l of sample to the microchannel and a 20 min incubation, 2 \u00b5l of biotinylated 2nd antibody for either antigen was infused and a 10 min incubation. Then 2 \u00b5l of avidin-horseradish peroxidase was infused; and after a 5 min incubation, the substrate for peroxidase was infused, and the luminescence intensity was measured. Calibration curves were obtained between the concentration and luminescence intensity over the range of 0 to 32 pg/ml (IL-6: R(2)\u200a=\u200a0.9994, TNF-\u03b1: R(2)\u200a=\u200a0.9977), and the detection limit for each protein was 0.28 pg/ml and 0.46 pg/ml, respectively.

PD copolymer is doped with 1% and 5% (w/w) Li(+) ion to produce PDLi1 and PDLi5 samples, respectively. In PD copolymer, the crystalline structure of PVDF changes from \u03b1 polymorph to a mixture of \u03b1 and \u03b2 polymorph, and it transforms completely to piezoelectric \u03b2 polymorph on doping with 1% (w/w) Li(+) ion. The impedance behavior of PVDF changes on grafting, and that of the PD graft copolymer also changes with increasing Li(+) ion dopant concentration. In the Nyquist plots, PVDF exhibits a straight line character, and a curvature has appeared in the PD graft copolymer; on doping the latter with Li(+) ion (1% w/w), the curvature increases and a semicircle is completed on 5% Li(+) doping. Fitting the data from the Z-view program, the Ohmic resistance of PDLi1 is found to be 78 M\u03a9 having capacitance with constant phase element (CPE) = 1.38 nF while for the PDLi5 sample the resistance decreases to16.1 M\u03a9 with a small increase in CPE to 1.46 nF.

Both the impedance and modulus vs frequency plots of PDLi1 and PDLi5 samples exhibit a single Debye peak suggesting isotropic nature of the samples. For PVDF and PDMAEMA, ac-conductivity increases linearly with angular frequency, but in the case of PDLi1 and PDLi5 samples, it remains at first invariant in the frequency range 1-10(2) Hz, and above 10(2) Hz, an increase in conductivity with frequency occurs obeying the double power law. In the temperature variation of conductivity, PVDF exhibits its typical insulating nature, and in the PD graft copolymer, the conductivity decreases with increase of temperature (metallic-like behavior) due to gradual breaking of supramolecular interaction. The temperature variation of ac-conductivity of the Li(+)-doped PD graft copolymer suggests that both the ionic and supramolecular contributions of conductivity operate; the former increases and the latter decreases with rise in temperature showing a maximum.

The effective measures include using a sandwich type piezoelectric transducer with flexurally vibrating end plates and an acoustic needle with conical tip section, decreasing the length of vibration excitation section at the needle root, bonding the needle root at a proper location of the transducer end plate, and tuning the length ratio of the conical tip section to the whole needle.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-01-09", "authors": ["NingLi", "JunhuiHu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2012.12.002"}

A randomly selected intervention (5 OMT techniques or a Sham) was applied to the cervical SD clinically considered to be most severe. A durometer (SA201(\u00ae); Sigma Instruments, Cranberry, PA, USA) objectively measured myofascial structures overlying each cervical spinal segment pre- and post- intervention. Using a single consistent piezoelectric impulse, this durometer quantified four hysteresis (tissue texture) characteristics--fixation, mobility, frequency, and motoricity.\nBaseline changes in median hysteresis values were noted for each OMT technique but not for Sham interventions. Notably, segmental counterstrain OMT resulted in significant motoricity change compared to adjacent segmental myofascial measures (p-value 0.04) along with a suggestive trend in the mobility component (p-value 0.12).\nWhen comparing treated to untreated cervical segments, the most significant change occurred post-counterstrain OMT with no overall change following Sham.

Most countries, especially the developing countries, lack efficacious and inexpensive tools for early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) resistance to antituberculosis drugs and for preventing the carriers from acquiring further resistance. This report describes an indirect series piezoelectric (ISP) system for simultaneous and early detection of M. tuberculosis resistance to antituberculosis drugs. The ISP system can continually monitor the frequency shift change profiles of 32 detection cells resulting from the changes of volatile metabolites group during M. tuberculosis growth. The quantification detection time (QDT) obtained from the frequency shift change profile was found to be characterisitc of M. tuberculosis resistance. A drug-free chamber was used as a control, in which 1% of M. tuberculosis isolate was added. By comparing the QDT obtained from growth of M. tuberculosis isolate in each drug-containing chamber with that in a drug-free chamber, forty strains of clinical M. tuberculosis isolates were categorized by our method.

However, for those flexural transducers with moderate thickness, the thin-plate assumptions are no longer valid. To analyze and predict the behaviors of the flexural transducers with moderate thickness, we must establish a new theory.

{"title": "Substrate-free multi-cellular aggregates of human gingival fibroblasts-fabrication, biomechanics and significance for tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "We fabricate multi-cellular aggregates of human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) using a novel in vivo method that omits supportive flexible substrates. On the basis of the multi-cellular aggregates, constructive and destructive effects of mechanical stimulation are investigated.\nhGFs were seeded onto aligned glass slides (one fixed, one mobile) with an initial gap <30 \u03bcm between their connecting edges. After the cells adhere, one of the glass slides is displaced using high precision threads and a piezoelectric element, widening the gap gradually.\nAfter several days of gradually widening the gap, multiple multi-cellular hGF aggregates formed, bridging the gap between the glass slides. The effects of discrete displacement events on previously established multi-cellular aggregates ranged from considerable growth and consolidation to collapse and disintegration. A quantitative criterion for assessing the probability for collapse/disintegration of hGF multi-cellular aggregates based on evaluating the meniscus curvature at the free edges before and after displacement is presented and discussed. The curvature is suggested as a representative parameter to characterize the mechanical condition of multi-cellular aggregates, as it is affected by adhesion of cells to the glass slides, cohesion inside the multi-cellular aggregate and the external mechanical load generated by the displacement of the glass slides.\nThe presented results clarify the potential and limitations of using mechanical stimulation for initiating and controlling regeneration of (gingival) tissue.

Analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs suggests \u223c10 nm coating thickness of MWNTs by ILs, and the covalent linkage of ILs with MWNTs is confirmed from FT-IR and Raman spectra. PVDF nanocomposites with full \u03b2-polymorphic (piezoelectric) form are prepared using MWNT-IL by both the solvent cast and melt-blending methods. The FE-SEM and TEM micrographs indicate that IL-bound MWNTs are homogeneously dispersed within the PVDF matrix. Increasing MWNT-IL concentration in the composites results in increased \u03b2 polymorph formation with a concomitant decrease of the \u03b1 polymorph, and a 100% \u03b2 polymorph formation occurs for 1 wt % MWNT-IL in both the fabrication conditions. A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study shows that the MWNT-ILs are an efficient nucleating agent for PVDF crystallization preferentially nucleating the \u03b2 form due to its dipolar interactions with PVDF. The glass transition temperature (T(g)) gradually increases with an increase in MWNT-IL concentration, and the storage modulus (G') of the composites increases significantly, showing a maximum increase of 101.3% for 0.5 wt % MWNT-IL. The Young's modulus increases with MWNT-IL concentration, and analysis of the data using the Halpin-Tsai equation suggests that at low concentration they adopt an orientation parallel to the film surface; however, at higher MWNT-IL concentration it is randomly oriented. The tensile strength also increases with an increase in MWNT-IL concentration, and both the Young's modulus and the tensile strength of solvent cast films are lower than melt-blended samples. The elongation at break in the solvent cast samples shows a maximum, but in melt-blended samples it decreases continuously with increasing MWNT-IL concentration. The composites exhibit a very low conductivity percolation threshold at 0.05 wt %, and the three-dimensional conducting network is produced. Higher conductivity (\u223c1 S/cm for 1% MWNT-IL) than other MWNT/PVDF composites has been attributed to the anchored ionic liquid.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2013-01-04", "authors": ["AmitMandal", "Arun KNandi"], "doi": "10.1021/am302275b"}

However, it is challenging to detect small peptides efficiently by the conventional Western blotting method with shaking, in part because the peptides readily detach from the blotted membrane. Although some modified Western blotting protocols have been developed to overcome this problem, it remains difficult to prevent peptide detachment from the membrane. In this study, we show that the previously developed vacuum-assisted detection method greatly improves the detection of small peptides without additional protocol modification. The vacuum-assisted method was developed to shorten the time required for all immunodetection steps, and all the Western blotting solutions penetrated the membrane quickly and efficiently by this method. By using this vacuum method, we succeeded in detecting small peptides that were completely undetectable by the conventional Western blotting method. We also confirmed that peptide detachment was induced even by gentle shaking in the case of the conventional method, and the detachment was accelerated when detergent was present in the buffer. Unlike in the conventional method, there is no need to shake the membrane in solution in the vacuum method.

Spherulite morphologies and thermal behavior of the membranes were studied by polarized light optical microscopy (PLO) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) separately. It was found that the crystallization behavior of PVDF membranes was closely related to the preparation methods. For membranes prepared by the NIPS method, the skin layers had a mixture of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases, the overall membranes were predominantly \u03b1 phase, and the total crystallinity was 60.0% with no spherulite. For melt spinning membranes, the surface layers also showed a mixture of \u03b1\u00a0and \u03b2 phases, the overall membranes were predominantly \u03b1 phase.

The newly designed dopant delivery system avoids problems associated with traditional liquid delivery systems such as solvent immiscibility, backpressure and increased post-column dead volume issues. The performance of the new device was tested and evaluated using chlorobenzene as a dopant with a test mixture consisting of 18 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results show that the new system works robustly at low dopant consumption level (1.6 uL min(-1)), consuming only approximately 5% of the amount used by conventional sources. The low dopant consumption has resulted in up to a 20-fold reduction in signal intensity of tested PAH molecules, but has led to less presence of background cluster ions and dopant trace contaminant background ions in the source area. Consequently, all tested PAHs were detected with excellent signal-to-noise ratio with at least two- to ten-fold improvements in the limit of detection and quantification compared to those obtained with traditional dopant assistance using a post-column addition method.", "journal": "European journal of mass spectrometry (Chichester, England)", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["Ma'an HAmad", "Er QiangLi", "SalimSioud", "Sigurdur TThoroddsen"], "doi": "10.1255/ejms.1241"}

The dispersive relations are obtained and the effects of liquid viscosity on the phase velocity and attenuation of the waves are analyzed and discussed. From the results we can find that the effects of the liquid viscosity on the properties of SH-SAW are remarkable. The phase velocity decreases with increase of the viscous coefficient, or with increase of the frequency, and the attenuation increases with the frequency of the waves and the liquid viscosity, respectively. The relationship between attenuation and frequency or viscosity is nonlinear, but the former is a concave curve, whereas the latter is a convex curve.

Our results exhibit interesting behavior. (i) AlN and GaN share the same structural transition from wurtzite to a graphite-like phase at very large compressive strains, similarly to other wurtzite semiconductors. Our calculations further reveal that this well-known phase transition is driven by the transverse-acoustic soft phonon mode associated with elastic instabilities. (ii) The applied tensile strain can either drastically suppress or strongly enhance the polarization and piezoelectricity, based on the value of the strain. Furthermore, large enhancements of polarization and piezoelectricity close to the phase-transition regions at large compressive strains are predicted, similar to those previously predicted in ferroelectric fields. Our calculations indicate that such colossal enhancements are strongly correlated to phase transitions when large atomic displacements are generated by external strains. (iii) Under the same strain, AlN and GaN have significantly different electronic properties: both wurtzite and graphite-like AlN always display direct band structures, while the the bandgap of wurtzite GaN is always direct and that of graphite-like GaN always indirect. Furthermore, the bandgap of graphite-like AlN is greatly enhanced by large compressive strain, but that of wurtzite GaN is not sensitive to compressive strain.

{"title": "Influence of the middle ear anatomy on the performance of a membrane sensor in the incudostapedial joint gap.", "abstract": "There is a great demand for implantable microphones for future generations of implantable hearing aids, especially Cochlea Implants. An implantable middle ear microphone based on a piezoelectric membrane sensor for insertion into the incudostapedial gap is investigated. The sensor is designed to measure the sound-induced forces acting on the center of the membrane. The sensor mechanically couples to the adjacent ossicles via two contact areas, the sensor membrane and the sensor housing. The sensing element is a piezoelectric single crystal bonded on a titanium membrane. The sensor allows a minimally invasive and reversible implantation without removal of ossicles and without additional sensor fixation in the tympanic cavity. This study investigates the implantable microphone sensor and its implantation concept. It intends to quantify the influence of the sensor's insertion position on the achievable microphone sensitivity. The investigation considers anatomical and pathological variations of the middle ear geometry and its space limitations. Temporal bone experiments on a laboratory model show that anatomical and pathological variations of the middle ear geometry can prevent the sensor from being placed optimally within the incudostapedial joint. Beyond scattering of transfer functions due to anatomic variations of individual middle ears there is the impact of variations in the sensor position within the ossicular chain that has a considerable effect on the transfer characteristics of the middle ear microphone. The centering of the sensor between incus and stapes, the direction of insertion (membrane to stapes or to incus) and the effect of additional contact points with surrounding anatomic structures affect the signal yield of the implanted sensor. The presence of additional contact points has a considerably impact on the sensitivity, yet the microphone sensitivity is quite robust against small changes in the positioning of the incus on the sensor. Signal losses can be avoided by adjusting the position of the sensor within the joint. The findings allow the development of an improved surgical insertion technique to ensure maximally achievable signal yield of the membrane sensor in the ISJ and provides valuable knowledge for a future design considerations including sensor miniaturization and geometry. Measurements of the implanted sensor in temporal bone specimens showed a microphone sensitivity in the order of 1 mV/Pa.

In this study, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were unzipped by an oxidative unzipping process before dispersing in PVDF matrix, and unzipped MWCNTs (\u03bcCNTs) with different unzipping degrees were obtained through controlling the amounts of oxidant (KMnO(4)). Due to the increased available interface area and specific interaction between the oxygen-containing groups (such as >C=O) in \u03bcCNTs and the >CF(2) group of PVDF, the dispersion of \u03bcCNTs in PVDF matrix is tremendously improved. The resulting PVDF/\u03bcCNTs nanocomposites were characterized by wide angle X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. It is found that \u03bcCNTs nucleate PVDF crystallization and enhance piezoelectric \u03b2 phase with a concomitant decrease of \u03b1 phase. This is particularly true for the nanocomposites including the \u03bcCNTs with higher unzipping degree, in which the mass crystallinity and content of \u03b2 phase (F(\u03b2)) were enhanced, implied by the increased piezoelectric constant d(33).

Total binding and non-specific binding were measured using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D).

Since the GABA(B) receptor is an integral membrane protein, solubilizing GABA(B)R2 is difficult. To circumvent this problem and to identify specific phosphatases that dephosphorylate S783, we employed an in vitro assay based on dephosphorylation of proteins on PVDF membranes by purified phosphatases. Our method allowed us to demonstrate that S783 in GABA(B)R2 is directly dephosphorylated by PP2A (but not by PP1, PP2B nor PP2C) in a dose-dependent and okadaic acid-sensitive manner. We also show that the level of phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of AMPK at T172 is reduced by PP1, PP2A and PP2C.

The effects of the electric field on the filtration performance, including resistance and retention, modification of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and possible intermediates produced during electro-ultrafiltration, were studied thoroughly. The results clearly indicate that the combination of the electric field with ultrafiltration could increase BP-3 rejection and reduce filtration resistance.

The decrease in contact angle demonstrated the improvement of hydrophilicity in the PVDF membrane surface after the electrofiltration treatment.

The results showed that the PVDF membranes offered good performances and excellent stability in VFB applications, where it could, performance-wise, truly substitute Nafion in VFB applications, but at a much lower cost.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["WenpingWei", "HuaminZhang", "XianfengLi", "HongzhangZhang", "YunLi", "IvoVankelecom"], "doi": "10.1039/c2cp43761a"}
{"title": "Drosophila NOMPC is a mechanotransduction channel subunit for gentle-touch sensation.", "abstract": "Touch sensation is essential for behaviours ranging from environmental exploration to social interaction; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In Drosophila larvae, two types of sensory neurons, class III and class IV dendritic arborization neurons, tile the body wall. The mechanotransduction channel PIEZO in class IV neurons is essential for sensing noxious mechanical stimuli but is not involved in gentle touch. On the basis of electrophysiological-recording, calcium-imaging and behavioural studies, here we report that class III dendritic arborization neurons are touch sensitive and contribute to gentle-touch sensation. We further identify NOMPC (No mechanoreceptor potential C), a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels, as a mechanotransduction channel for gentle touch. NOMPC is highly expressed in class III neurons and is required for their mechanotransduction. Moreover, ectopic NOMPC expression confers touch sensitivity to the normally touch-insensitive class IV neurons. In addition to the critical role of NOMPC in eliciting gentle-touch-mediated behavioural responses, expression of this protein in the Drosophila S2 cell line also gives rise to mechanosensitive channels in which ion selectivity can be altered by NOMPC mutation, indicating that NOMPC is a pore-forming subunit of a mechanotransduction channel. Our study establishes NOMPC as a bona fide mechanotransduction channel that satisfies all four criteria proposed for a channel to qualify as a transducer of mechanical stimuli and mediates gentle-touch sensation. Our study also suggests that different mechanosensitive channels may be used to sense gentle touch versus noxious mechanical stimuli.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["ZhiqiangYan", "WeiZhang", "YeHe", "DavidGorczyca", "YangXiang", "Li ECheng", "ShanMeltzer", "Lily YehJan", "Yuh NungJan"], "doi": "10.1038/nature11685"}

It has been shown that in strongly imprinted films application of switching pulses of opposite polarity results in qualitatively different domain switching dynamics. A distinct feature of domain dynamics is roughening of the domains walls during switching to the preferred polarization state as opposed to smooth domain boundaries during switching to the opposite direction. The observed switching behavior is explained by a combined effect of the spatially uniform built-in electric field and local disorder potential. Application of the external potential changes the balance between the two and creates conditions under which domain growth is dominated either by the average built-in electric field or local random-bond disorder potential.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["PankajSharma", "TakashiNakajima", "SoichiroOkamura", "AlexeiGruverman"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/24/1/015706"}

In this paper, we present a new approach to combine thin conductive boron-doped as well as insulating nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) with sputtered AlN films without the need for any buffer layers between AlN and NCD or polishing steps. The zeta potentials of differently treated nanodiamond (ND) particles in aqueous colloids are adjusted to the zeta potential of AlN in water. Thereby, the nucleation density for the initial growth of diamond on AlN can be varied from very low (10(8)\u00a0cm(-2)), in the case of hydrogen-treated ND seeding particles, to very high values of 10(11)\u00a0cm(-2) for oxidized ND particles. Our approach yielding high nucleation densities allows the growth of very thin NCD films on AlN with thicknesses as low as 40\u00a0nm for applications such as microelectromechanical beam resonators. Fabricated piezo-actuated micro-resonators exhibit enhanced mechanical properties due to the incorporation of boron-doped NCD films.

{"title": "Analysis of UF membrane fouling mechanisms caused by organic interactions in seawater.", "abstract": "Organic fouling remains a significant challenge in the application of ultrafiltration (UF) pretreatment systems in the desalination industry. In this study, the fouling potential of organic materials in seawater was investigated using model seawater solution containing humic acid and alginate. The buildup of organic fouling on UF membranes was studied after consecutive filtration cycles with periodical backwash. The effects of varying backwash conditions (duration, frequency, permeate/deionized water) on membrane performance were analysed. It was observed that the variation in filtration condition resulted in minor differences in membrane performance provided the total backwash volume applied remained constant. However, the substitution of permeate water backwash with deionized water improved fouling reversibility significantly. Furthermore, advanced characterisation of the membrane fouling layer after filtration revealed significant differences in foulant distribution due to the nature of the backwash solution. Deionized water backwash was found to be particularly effective in removing alginate from the membrane fouling layer, although the humic acid adsorbed onto the membrane surface were not significantly affected. However, permeability testing of the membranes after chemical cleaning revealed higher levels of irrecoverable fouling after deionized water backwash. From the data obtained in this study, a fouling mechanism is therefore proposed, in which the alginate fouling layer performs as a dynamic membrane, prefiltering smaller humic acid molecules and reducing adsorption on the membrane surface.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["AdhikaraResosudarmo", "YunYe", "PierreLe-Clech", "VickiChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.024"}

There is considerable interest in cell repair following damage mediated by dental surgical procedures. Cells can tolerate stress by expressing heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). During and after surgical tooth removal, oxidative stress can activate Hsp70 expression proportional to the intensity of the stress signal stimulus to cope with stress. This study examined the expression of Hsp70 as a potential biomarker of immediate postoperative stress in patients undergoing two different surgical procedures of different severity. Expression of Hsp70 both at mRNA and at protein level in the conventional group was two-fold higher than that of the piezo group. This suggests that tooth movement by the piezo method causes relatively lower stress in the alveolar bone. Piezosurgery provides relatively low stress to the patients and this may help cell repair after the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing more aggressive surgery using conventional methods showed a significant increase in Hsp70 in the immediate postoperative period.

It can also be used for precise mechanical force measurements as well as vehicle to apply pressure with precision.

For MOAT group 2 patients, the result is called inconclusive; hence, both sperm and oocyte deficiencies may still contribute to the previous ICSI fertilization failure.\nThe calcium-releasing ability of sperm from 26 MOAT patients with a history of zero or low fertilization following conventional ICSI was compared with the calcium-releasing ability of sperm from 4 control patients, with proven oocyte activation potential. Per case an average of 19 mouse oocytes were injected. Calcium imaging started within 5-10 min after ICSI and continued for 2 h.\nHuman sperm were demembranated with 0.02% lysolecithin for 1 min immediately before heterologous piezo-driven ICSI. For calcium imaging, metaphase II oocytes from B6D2/F1 mice were loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. The calcium oscillatory patterns following heterologous ICSI were scored per oocyte and per patient individually based on the presence of calcium spikes and their frequency and amplitude.\nFor patients with low or high MOAT activating capacity (MOAT group 1 or 3, respectively), calcium analysis confirmed the MOAT result. For patients with a former inconclusive intermediate MOAT activating capacity result (MOAT group 2), no or strongly dissimilar calcium oscillatory patterns were seen, with significantly lower amplitude and frequency compared with control sperm. When the product of the amplitude and the frequency of the calcium traces was compared between the groups, MOAT group 1 and 2 cases differed significantly from MOAT group 3 cases and the control sperm (P < 0.01).\nThe results of the calcium analysis in mouse oocytes should not be directly extrapolated to human oocytes, since it is well known that human spermatozoa exhibit a greater activating potency in mouse oocytes compared with mouse spermatozoa. Furthermore, not much is known yet about the influence of aberrant calcium oscillatory patterns, such as found in MOAT group 2 patients, on pre- and post-implantation embryo development in the human.\nBased on the current calcium oscillatory pattern analysis, we found that the product of calcium spike amplitude with its frequency allowed us to create a new threshold value, which can assist in confirming or refuting, on a single patient base, a sperm-borne activation deficiency. The latter is especially interesting for patients with a former intermediate inconclusive MOAT result (MOAT group 2 patients), for whom calcium oscillatory pattern analysis should be considered.\nF.V.M. is holder of an aspirant clinical research mandate by the Flemish foundation of Scientific Research (FWO-Vlaanderen).

These elements form the basic building blocks of a viable, un-tethered, and portable ultrasound applicator that can produce intensities on the order of 100mW/cm(2) spatial-peak temporal-peak (I(SPTP)) with minimum (on the order of 15V) excitation voltage. The ultrasound applicator can be constructed with different numbers of individual transducer elements and different geometries such that its footprint or active area is adjustable. The primary motivation behind this research was to develop a tether-free, battery operated, fully portable ultrasound applicator for therapeutic applications such as wound healing and non-invasive transdermal delivery of both naked and encapsulated drugs. It is shown that careful selection of the components determining applicator architecture allows the displacement amplitude to be maximized for a specific frequency of operation. The work described here used the finite-element analysis software COMSOL to identify the geometry and material properties that permit the applicator's design to be optimized. By minimizing the excitation voltage required to achieve the desired output (100mW/cm(2)I(SPTP)) the power source (rechargeable Li-Polymer batteries) size may be reduced permitting both the electronics and ultrasound applicator to fit in a wearable housing.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2012-10-09", "authors": ["Christopher RBawiec", "YouhanSunny", "An TNguyen", "Joshua ASamuels", "Michael SWeingarten", "Leonid AZubkov", "Peter ALewin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2012.09.005"}

Hence, the main goal of dental scaling is to remove bacterial plaque and obtain smoother tooth surfaces. This study was aimed to assess the influence of tip wear of ultrasonic scaler inserts on root surface roughness at different working parameters. Twenty piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler inserts (10 worn/10 new) were selected to examine the erosion ratio (ER) on the scaler tips and to assess the influence of tip wear on root surface roughness. Erosion on the tip surfaces was evaluated under atomic force microscopy (AFM). Root samples were prepared and instrumented by new (Group I) and worn (Group II) inserts at different working parameters. Roughness change (Rc) on root surfaces after instrumentation was examined under profilometer and compared between and within the groups. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean ERs of new and worn tips (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The results of this study showed that tip angulation and instrument power strongly influenced the Rc values on instrumented samples (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). It was also revealed that tip wear influenced the Rc values on root surfaces especially at 45\u00b0 tip angulation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Distinct plate displacement shape functions were defined for the regions underneath and outside the active electrodes. The plate shape functions were solved analytically using classic plate theory in conjunction with the external boundary conditions and the internal ones between the two regions in order to calculate the exact plate displacement under both external voltage stimulus and acoustic pressure. The model was used to study the effect of the electrode area on the overall plate deflection per unit input voltage such that the electromechanical coupling is optimized. While the center plate deflection increased monotonically with the electrode area for a simply supported plate, it followed a parabolic shape for a clamped one with a maximum deflection when the electrode radius covered 60% of the total plate radius. The simply supported plate exhibited four times the plate deflection capability of its clamped counterpart, when both are operating at their optimal electrode size. Both an experimental clamped bimorph aluminum nitride (AlN) pMUT, recently reported in the literature, and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) were used to verify the developed model. The theoretical model predicted a static displacement per unit voltage of 10.9nm/V and a resonant frequency of 196.5kHz, which were in excellent agreement with the FEM results of 10.32nm/V and 198.5kHz, respectively. The modeling data matched well with the experimental measurements and the error ranged from 2.7-22% due to process variations across the wafer.

{"title": "Venus flytrap biomechanics: forces in the Dionaea muscipula trap.", "abstract": "Biomechanics of morphing structures in the Venus flytrap has attracted the attention of scientists during the last 140 years. The trap closes in a tenth of a second if a prey touches a trigger hair twice. The driving force of the closing process is most likely due to the elastic curvature energy stored and locked in the leaves, which is caused by a pressure differential between the upper and lower layers of the leaf. The trap strikes, holds and compresses the prey. We have developed new methods for measuring all these forces involved in the hunting cycle. We made precise calibration of the piezoelectric sensor and performed direct measurements of the average impact force of the trap closing using a high speed video camera for the determination of time constants. The new equation for the average impact force was derived. The impact average force between rims of two lobes in the Venus flytrap was found equal to 149 mN and the corresponding pressure between the rims was about 41 kPa. Direct measurements of the constriction force in the trap of Dionaea muscipula was performed during gelatin digestion. This force increases in the process of digestion from zero to 450 mN with maximal constriction pressure created by the lobes reaching to 9 kPa. The insects and different small prey have little chance to escape after the snap of the trap.

In \"simple extractions\", similar surgery times were observed for both techniques, but pain was greatest on the day of surgery when the burr was used. Bone heat osteonecrosis was observed only in the rotatory group and a high level of alkaline phosphatase was noted only in the Piezoelectric group.\nPain after extraction of a mandibular third molar increases with increased surgical difficulty and especially in longer interventions.

For that, a thin film of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was templated with protonated adrenaline HAdr. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), capacitive impedometry (CI), or piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) was integrated within each chemosensor for analytical signal transduction. First, molecular structure of prepolymerization complex of HAdr with bis(2,2'-bithienyl)methane substituted with the benzo-(18-crown-6) 2 and 4-carboxyphenyl 3 was thermodynamically optimized at the B3LYP/6-31g(d) level. Then, a HAdr-templated MIP film was deposited on the Pt disk electrode and on the Au film electrode of a 10-MHz quartz crystal resonator (QCR) by potentiodynamic electropolymerization from solution of HAdr, 2, 3, and the cross-linking tris([2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl)methane 4 monomer at the HAdr:2:3:4 = 1:1:1:2 mole ratio. For determination of Adr, the DPV peak current for the K4[Fe(CN)6] redox probe under batch conditions and the resonant frequency and capacity of the electrical double layer under FIA conditions were measured. The lower limits of detection (LOD) were 2 nM, 0.5 \u03bcM, and 1.5 \u03bcM for the DPV, PM, and CI chemosensor, respectively, indicating suitability of the DPV chemosensor for Adr determination in biological systems (-50 nM).

Oscillating electrical fields were delivered to rat neurons via substrates consisting of poly(vinylidene fluoride) film, both in its piezoelectric (PZ) and non-piezoelectric (PV) forms. To induce oscillating electrical fields at the film surfaces, a 50\u00a0Hz mechanical vibration was applied. After 4\u00a0days of mechano-electrical stimulation, neuronal densities were increased by 115% and neurons grew 79% more neurites, with more than double the branch points, compared with neurons grown on non-stimulated PZ films (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The effects were due to electrical field, because vibration applied to non-PZ films did not increase neurite growth. We conclude that the oscillating electric fields produced from PZ polymer substrates can induce plastic changes in neurons of the central nervous system and herein we show its influence on neurite growth and branching.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2012-08-07", "authors": ["N\u00fariaRoyo-Gascon", "MichaelWininger", "Jerry IScheinbeim", "Bonnie LFirestein", "WilliamCraelius"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-012-0628-y"}
{"title": "Microfluidic acoustic trapping force and stiffness measurement using viscous drag effect.", "abstract": "It has recently been demonstrated that it was possible to individually trap 70\u03bcm droplets flowing within a 500\u03bcm wide microfluidic channel by a 24MHz single element piezo-composite focused transducer. In order to further develop this non-invasive approach as a microfluidic particle manipulation tool of high precision, the trapping force needs to be calibrated to a known force, i.e., viscous drag force arising from the fluid flow in the channel. However, few calibration studies based on fluid viscosity have been carried out with focused acoustic beams for moving objects in microfluidic environments. In this paper, the acoustic trapping force (F(trapping)) and the trap stiffness (or compliance k) are experimentally determined for a streaming droplet in a microfluidic channel. F(trapping) is calibrated to viscous drag force produced from syringe pumps. Chebyshev-windowed chirp coded excitation sequences sweeping the frequency range from 18MHz to 30MHz is utilized to drive the transducer, enabling the beam transmission through the channel/fluid interface for interrogating the droplets inside the channel. The minimum force (F(min,trapping)) required for initially immobilizing drifting droplets is determined as a function of pulse repetition frequency (PRF), duty factor (DTF), and input voltage amplitude (V(in)) to the transducer. At PRF=0.1kHz and DTF=30%, F(min,trapping) is increased from 2.2nN for V(in)=22V(pp) to 3.8nN for V(in)=54V(pp). With a fixed V(in)=54V(pp) and DTF=30%, F(min,trapping) can be varied from 3.8nN at PRF=0.1kHz to 6.7nN at PRF=0.5kHz. These findings indicate that both higher driving voltage and more frequent beam transmission yield stronger traps for holding droplets in motion. The stiffness k can be estimated through linear regression by measuring the trapping force (F(trapping)) corresponding to the displacement (x) of a droplet from the trap center. By plotting F(trapping) - x curves for certain values of V(in) (22/38/54V(pp)) at DTF=10% and PRF=0.1kHz, k is measured to be 0.09, 0.14, and 0.20nN/\u03bcm, respectively. With variable PRF from 0.1 to 0.5kHz at V(in)=54 V(pp), k is increased from 0.20 to 0.42nN/\u03bcm. It is shown that a higher PRF leads to a more compliant trap formation (or a stronger F(trapping)) for a given displacement x. Hence the results suggest that this acoustic trapping method has the potential as a noninvasive manipulation tool for individual moving targets in microfluidics by adjusting the transducer's excitation parameters.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2012-07-25", "authors": ["JungwooLee", "Jong SeobJeong", "K KirkShung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2012.06.008"}

To evaluate it, we firstly measured silicone rubber samples with different softness. Then, it was applied to human forearm skin before and after tape-stripping. A VapoMeter and skin-surface hygrometer were used to confirm removal of the stratum corneum. A Cutometer was used to obtain conventional softness data for comparison.\nBoth the piezoelectric tactile sensor and the load cell could measure the softness of silicone rubber samples, but the piezoelectric tactile sensor was more sensitive than the load cell when the reaction force of the measured sample was under 100 mN in response to a 2-mm indentation. For human skin in vivo, transepidermal water loss and skin conductance were significantly changed after tape-stripping, confirming removal of the stratum corneum. The piezoelectric tactile sensor detected a significant change after tape-stripping, whereas the load cell did not. Thus, the piezoelectric tactile sensor can detect changes of mechanical properties at the skin surface. The load cell data were in agreement with Cutometer measurements, which showed no change in representative skin elasticity parameters after tape-stripping.

An iterative procedure was developed to handle a boundary condition that takes into account the mandibular asymmetries. The results showed asymmetries in the contact pressure distributions that indicated with precision the patient's malocclusion diagnosis. In vivo measurements of contact pressure using piezoelectric sensors agreed with the computational results. It was shown that the left and right ends of the expansion screw move differently with respect to the patient mandible, even though the expansion screw has an opening mechanism to ensure equal stretching at both ends. The contact pressures between the apparatus and the mucosa vary linearly with applied forces, which can simplify the analysis of the biomechanical behaviour of the expander mandible apparatus.

Our contribution deals only with the mechanical processes and the biological aspects have not been taken into account. It is well known that osteoblasts are able to generate bone in a suitable bony substitute only under fluid action. But the bone created in this manner is not organised to resist specific mechanical stress. Our aim was to suggest the nature of the physical information that can be transmitted - directly or via a biological or biochemical process - to the cell to initiate a cellular activity inducing the reconstruction of the osteon that is best adapted to local mechanical stresses. For this, the cell must have, from our point of view, a good knowledge of its structural environment. But this knowledge exists at the cellular scale while the bone is loaded at the macroscopic scale. This study is based on the SiNuPrOs model that allows exchange of information between the different structural scales of cortical bone. It shows that more than the fluid, the collagen - via its piezoelectric properties - plays an essential role in the transmission of information between the macroscopic and nanoscopic scales.
