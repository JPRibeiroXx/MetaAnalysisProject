Streamline based techniques are frequently applied for visualization of these electrical fields. In this work we present a new automated technique for placement of seed points of streamlines. The technique is based on a sequential optimization algorithm. In each step a set of random seed points is created. A single point of these is selected, which is optimal in such a manner that the distribution of density of streamlines fits best to the distribution of electrical current density. The iteration ends, when a pre-given number of streamlines was generated. Several examples illustrate the characteristic properties of the technique in electrical fields of small complexity. Additionally, results from a bidomain simulation of excitation propagation are visualized.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Current theories rely on the inherent heterogeneity of cardiac tissue as contributing to this phenomenon. This paper explores a possible mechanism for far-field stimulation in relation to fiber curvature. We incorporate a randomized fiber angle geometry into a two-dimensional active cardiac tissue model with unequal anisotropy ratios already exhibiting smooth, curving fibers. We simulate cross-field stimulation to initiate reentry in the tissue model, and compare the electric field thresholds at different S1-S2 intervals for tissue with randomized fiber angles and tissue with a smooth fiber geometry. The tissue with random fiber angles has a significantly lower threshold for reentry at certain intervals on the strength-interval curve. We conclude that a random fiber geometry may have an effect on the mechanism for far-field stimulation.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Our hypothesis, which we test by numerical simulation, is that Vm is greater than +/- 400 mV at the tissue surface, but optical mapping underestimates Vm because it averages over depth. Results indicate a significant underestimation of Vm. Experimental studies indicate a depolarization of the resting transmembrane potential, Vrest, after a strong shock.

{"title": "Using models of the passive cardiac conductivity and full heart anisotropic bidomain to study the epicardial potentials in ischemia.", "abstract": "In this paper we present a multi-scale approach for cardiac modeling. Based on the histology of cardiac tissue we created a geometrical model at a cellular scale to compute the effective conductivity of a piece of cardiac tissue. In turn, the conductivity values obtained from this cellular scale model were used in a whole heart model in which we simulated regional, subendocardial ischemia. Histological changes at a cellular level led to changes in the effective conductivity tensor of the tissue, which in turn resulted in changes in the epicardial potential patterns during the ST-interval. Two effects were studied using this multi-scale approach: (1) the influence of a dynamically growing ischemic region on the epicardial potentials, and (2) the influence of a dynamically changing conductivity in the ischemic zone due to changes in the underlying pathology. One specific finding was the presence of epicardial patterns consisting of a central elevation and two opposite depressions at the edges of the ischemic zone which rotated as the ischemia became more transmural. In addition, the epicardial potentials decreased in magnitude with the duration of the ischemia due to changes in the effective conductivity of the ischemic tissue predicted by the cellular level model.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The \"clinical observation phase\"; 2. the \"coronary care unit phase\"; 3. the \"high-technology phase\"; and 4. the \"evidence-based coronary care phase\". A significant advance in the care of patients with acute myocardial infarction that arose as an outgrowth of the evidence-based era was introduction of a lexicon that more accurately reflected contemporary concepts of the pathophysiology underlying myocardial ischemia and infarction. Although considerable improvement has occurred in the process of care for patient with STEMI, room for improvement exists. Despite strong evidence in the literature that prompt use of reperfusion therapy improves survival of STEMI patients such treatment is underutilized and often not administered in an expeditious timeframe relative to the onset of symptom. Even in the reperfusion era, left ventricular dysfunction remains the single most important predictor of mortality following STEMI. After administration of aspirin, initiating reperfusion strategies and, where appropriate, beta blockade all STEMI patients should be considered for inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Several adjunctive pharmacotherapies have been investigated to prevent inflammatory damage in the infarct zone. Contrary to earlier beliefs that the heart is a terminally differentiated organ without the capacity to regenerate, evidence now exists that human cardiac myocytes divide after STEMI and stem cells can promote regeneration of cardiac tissue. These observations open up the possibility of myocardial replacement therapy after STEMI.", "journal": "Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association", "date": "2006-10-25", "authors": ["Elliott MAntman"], "doi": null}

Such destructive lesions to myocytes greatly hinder the capacity of the cardiac muscle to hypertrophy to meet the needs of bodily growth, pregnancy and certain intense sports activities. Endothelial cells also accelerate an early arteriosclerotic process, a potential cause of sudden death in the case of ostial stenosis. All such phenomena build up over time, together with the usual adult cardio-vascular risk factors. Finally, no cardiac tissue, pericardial, valvular endocardium or autonomic nervous tissue escapes these cytotoxic effects, giving rise to pericarditis, calcification, valvular leaks and arrythmias and conduction abnormalities. The resulting excessive cardiac mortality is one of the major concerns of paediatric oncologists, along with secondary tumours and leukaemia. This article analyses physiopathological consequences that are often asymptomatic or clinical, together with diagnostic, screening and follow-up methods for these patients, encouraging lifestyle modifications where appropriate or, when possible, treatment before the appearance of cardiac failure, myocardial infarction or sudden death. Other cytotoxic drugs such as high-dose cyclophosphamide, amsacrin, 5-FU and tubulin acting agents are also mentioned as a result of their cardiac toxicity, but this is not usually dose-cumulative.", "journal": "Bulletin du cancer", "date": "2005-05-19", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7oisPein", "LaurenceIserin", "Florentde Vathaire", "JeanLemerle"], "doi": null}

Oxidative stress may be important in the development of coronary artery disease. Fructose loaded rats, which show the characteristic features of insulin resistance, also display an imbalance between the peroxidation process and the antioxidant system. Alpha-lipoic acid (LA)--a co-enzyme--is known for its potent antioxidant effects. The present study examined whether LA mitigates fructose-induced oxidative stress in heart tissue.\nMale Wistar rats with a body weight of 150-170g were divided into 4 groups of 6 rats each. Control rats received a control diet containing starch and water ad libitum. Fructose rats received a fructose-enriched diet (>60% of total calories). Fructose + LA rats received a fructose diet and alpha-lipoic acid (35mg/kg b.w i.p.). Control + LA rats received control diet and alpha-lipoic acid. After the 20-day treatment period, we assessed the insulin sensitivity index in terms of HOMA. The levels of lipid peroxidation markers and the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant status in the heart tissue were measured. Plasma and heart tissue lipids were also analysed. Fructose rats showed decreased insulin sensitivity as reflected by high values of HOMA, increased peroxidation, impaired antioxidant status and lipid abnormalities in the cardiac tissue. These abnormalities were attenuated and the antioxidant levels were enhanced by LA. The reduction in HOMA values suggests LA improves insulin sensitivity.\nImprovement of insulin sensitivity and enhancement of cardiac antioxidant status suggest that LA may be useful as a cardioprotective agent in insulin-resistant states.", "journal": "Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD", "date": "2005-04-28", "authors": ["VThirunavukkarasu", "A TAnitha Nandhini", "C VAnuradha"], "doi": "10.1016/s0939-4753(04)80025-5"}

In this study, we expand our simulation to include an array of nine electrodes in active tissue with curving fibers. We compare the thresholds for rotor induction in tissue with and without electrodes by initiating a planar S1 wavefront and then stimulating the tissue at different intervals with a uniform S2 electric field perpendicular to S1. In tissue without plunge electrodes, virtual electrode polarization due to the curving fibers is generally widespread over the entire tissue, whereas polarization tends to be localized around the electrodes in tissue including them.\nOur results show that at some S1-S2 intervals, the presence of plunge electrodes can result in reentry when it otherwise would not be possible. For other S1-S2 intervals, such as during the vulnerable period when the reentry threshold is at a minimum, the induction of reentry is unaffected by the presence of plunge electrodes.\nPlunge electrodes can play an important role during the stimulation of cardiac tissue, but this is highly dependent on the chosen S1-S2 interval.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2005-04-27", "authors": ["Deborah LangrillBeaudoin", "Bradley JRoth"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.06.008"}

The pericardial fluid accumulates these regulatory agents and reflects well their levels in the myocardial interstitium. This offers a possibility to examine the local adenine nucleoside-endothelin interactions in heart tissue. We have previously demonstrated that increased levels of intrapericardial (i.p.)

The mechanism by which angiotensin II (Ang II) and dietary sodium exert additive effects on the development of cardiac hypertrophy is unclear. The goal of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that, where there is a genetic predisposition to Ang II-dependent hypertrophy, there is also an increased susceptibility to sodium-induced hypertrophy mediated by AT1-receptor expression.\nDiets of low sodium (LS, 0.3% w:w) and high sodium (HS, 4.0% w:w) content were fed to adult (age 25 weeks) control wild-type mice (WT) and to transgenic mice exhibiting cardiac-specific overexpression of angiotensinogen (TG). At the conclusion of a 40-day treatment period, cardiac tissue weights were compared and the relative expression levels of Ang II receptor subtypes (AT(1A) and AT(2)) were evaluated using RT-PCR.\nWT and TG mice fed HS and LS diets maintained comparable weight gains during the treatment period. The normalised heart weights of TG mice were elevated compared to WT, and the extent of the increase was greater for mice maintained on the HS diet treatments (WT 12% vs TG 41% increase in cardiac weight index). While a similar pattern of growth was observed for ventricular tissues, the atrial weight parameters demonstrated an additional significant effect of dietary sodium on tissue weight, independent of animal generic type. No differences in the relative (GAPDH normalised) expression levels of AT(1A)- and AT(2)-receptor mRNA were observed between diet or animal generic groups.\nThis study demonstrates that, where there is a pre-existing genetic condition of Ang II-dependent cardiac hypertrophy, the pro-growth effect of elevated dietary sodium is selectively augmented. In TG and WT mice, this effect was evident with a relatively short dietary treatment intervention (40 days). Evaluation of the levels of Ang II receptor mRNA further demonstrated that this differential growth response was not associated with an altered relative expression of either AT(1A)- or AT(2)-receptor subtypes.

Numerical simulations and experiments have indicated that this rotational anisotropy considerably affects the spread of excitation in cardiac tissue: the wave front shows a complex intramural shape with trailing cusps. The cusps can travel across layers and reach the epicardial and endocardial surfaces where they cause apparent accelerations of propagation. In the present study we provide an analytical description of the asymptotic wave front, as well as of cusp waves. We investigate the motion of cusp waves, based on the assumption that they occur at the intersection of asymptotic solutions, and we show that our theoretical analysis is in close agreement with numerical simulations.

In addition to APD restitution, conduction velocity restitution also plays an important role in the spatiotemporal dynamics of cardiac tissue. We present results concerning rate-dependent restitution in the velocity of propagating action potentials in a one-dimensional fiber.

Moreover, the discrepancy between wave-back velocity RCs is most significant for a small DI.

This has rendered difficult the proper design of an efficient and practical control stimulus protocol to eliminate such events. In order to gain new insights into the underlying electrophysiological and dynamical mechanisms of breakup, we applied linear perturbation theory to a steadily rotating spiral wave in two spatial dimensions. The tissue was composed of cells modeled using the Fenton-Karma equations whose parameters were chosen to emphasize alternans as a primary mechanism for breakup. Along with one meandering mode, not just one but several unstable alternans modes were found with differing growth rates, frequencies, and spatial structures. As the conductance of the fast inward current was increased, the instability of the modes increased, consistent with increased meandering and propensity for spiral breakup in simulations. We also explored a promising new approach, based on the theory, for the design of an energy efficient electrical stimulus protocol to control spiral wave breakup. The novelty lies in addressing the problem directly at the ion channel level and taking advantage of the inherent two dimensional nature of the rotating wave. With the help of the eigenmode method, we were able to calculate the exact timing and amplitude of the stimulus, and locate it optimally to maximize efficiency. The analysis led to a special-case example that demonstrated that a single, properly timed stimulus can have a global effect, suppressing all growing alternans modes over the entire tissue, thus inhibiting spiral wave breakup.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Refractoriness of cardiac muscle as affected by intercalated disks: a model study implications for fibrillation and defibrillation.", "abstract": "It is generally agreed that inhomogeneities of the recovery process in cardiac tissue play an important role in the genesis of reentrant arrhythmias. Regarding cardiac muscle as an assembly of discrete cells connected by gap junctions, differences in recovery may result from a nonuniformity of membrane or cable properties. In this study, a computer model of a one-dimensional cardiac muscle fiber including a periodic intercalated disk structure is used to study the influence of disk resistance (Rj) and stimulus strength (J) on refractoriness. Stimulating currents are applied externally in a bipolar arrangement. The basic effect of a current pulse is local de- and hyperpolarizations at the ends of an individual cell. Polarization develops very rapidly and increases with increasing values of Rj or J so that an interaction with membrane current kinetics becomes possible. When a premature stimulus is applied during repolarization of a conditioning action potential, multiple Na currents can occur, either caused by depolarization of the cathodal end of a cell or in the form of anode break excitation at the hyperpolarized end. Those currents affect the response of a fiber such that, at a given value of J, the refractory period is shortened by an increase in Rj. In a ring fiber model with different Rj values in the two halves of ring an extrastimulus timed between the refractory periods of the two branches results in a sustained circus movement. Varying stimulus strength yields an upper limit of vulnerability characterized by a \"synchronized extrasystole\". The ring model also implies the suppression of circus movement by an external shock. The minimal shock strength required for suppression is close to the upper limit of vulnerability. The simulations suggest that discrete effects of junctional resistance may be involved in fibrillation and defibrillation.", "journal": "General physiology and biophysics", "date": "2005-02-09", "authors": ["H GHaas", "KSolchenbach"], "doi": null}

Forty-eight Wistar-Albino female rats were randomly allocated into eight groups. Groups AC and BC were controls; groups AS and BS were sham-operated animals. Groups A1 and B1 underwent head trauma without treatment. Groups A2 and B2, head traumas plus EPO intraperitoneally (1000 IU/kg); groups A3 and B3, the vehicle groups, head traumas and intraperitoneal albumin (0.4 ml/rat). The method of weight drop was used to produce impact trauma at 24 hours after injury. Samples obtained from the left ventricle were assayed for lipid peroxidation and bcl-2 gene expression using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Lipid peroxidation in the heart tissue was determined by the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs). The results showed that administration of EPO significantly reduced the increase in lipid peroxidation by-products after moderate or severe trauma. The bcl-2 expression was significantly higher in EPO (A2 and B2) compared to trauma groups (A1 and B1) suggesting a protective effect. These findings suggest that EPO may play an important role in the expression of bcl-2 and decrease in TBARs-the end product of lipid peroxidation in myocytes-after moderate or severe TBI.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2005-02-03", "authors": ["MEmir", "KOzisik", "KCagli", "MMisirlioglu", "POzisik", "ZIscan", "EYildirim", "KKilinc", "ESener"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.11.101"}
{"title": "An in vitro analysis of myocardial potential indicates that phenotypic plasticity is an innate property of early embryonic tissue.", "abstract": "Explants from gastrula-stage avian embryos have provided an important culture model for examining the formation of the vertebrate heart. Explants harvested from anterior regions containing the precardiac mesoderm faithfully recapitulate cardiogenesis and generate contractile tissue in culture. Posterior regions of the early embryo do not supply cellular material to the developing heart in situ, and thus have been commonly employed as negative control tissues for studying cardiogenic induction. To begin to understand the cellular mechanisms that account for the distinct cell fates of precardiac and posterior tissue within the embryo, we undertook a comprehensive investigation on the myocardial potential of presumptive noncardiac tissue. Myocardial differentiation was assayed by expression of the myocardium-associated transcription factor gene Nkx2.5 and positive immunostaining for sarcomeric myosin, muscle alpha-actinin, and smooth muscle alpha-actin. Our results demonstrate that regions of the early embryo that do not provide a cellular contribution to the myocardium in situ are capable of generating myocardial tissue when removed from their normal embryonic environment and placed in culture under nontreated conditions. Although treatment with the presumptive cardiac inducer Dickkopf-1 increased the frequency that cardiac tissue appeared within cultures of posterior tissue, no difference was observed in either the size or morphology of the myocardium-positive areas among treated and nontreated explants. These findings suggest that progenitor cells within the early embryo possess an innate phenotypic plasticity and that presumptive cardiac inducing signals do not induce cardiac differentiation but instead augment a pre-existing cardiac potential of embryonic tissue.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2005-02-03", "authors": ["Leonard MEisenberg", "Carol AEisenberg"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2004.13.614"}
{"title": "Cardiac tissue ablation with catheter-based microwave heating.", "abstract": "The common condition of atrial fibrillation is often treated by cutting diseased cardiac tissue to disrupt abnormal electrical conduction pathways. Heating abnormal tissue with electromagnetic power provides a minimally invasive surgical alternative to treat these cardiac arrhythmias. Radio frequency ablation has become the method of choice of many physicians. Recently, microwave power has also been shown to have great therapeutic benefit in medical treatment requiring precise heating of biological tissue. Since microwave power tends to be deposited throughout the volume of biological media, microwave heating offers advantages over other heating modalities that tend to heat primarily the contacting surface. It is also possible to heat a deeper volume of tissue with more precise control using microwaves than with purely thermal conduction or RF electrode heating. Microwave Cardiac Ablation (MCA) is used to treat heart tissue that allows abnormal electrical conduction by heating it to the point of inactivation. Microwave antennas that fit within catheter systems can be positioned close to diseased tissue. Specialized antenna designs that unfurl from the catheter within the heart can then radiate specifically shaped fields, which overcome problems such as excessive surface heating at the contact point. The state of the art in MCA is reviewed in this paper and a novel catheter-based unfurling wide aperture antenna is described. This antenna consists of the centre conductor of a coaxial line, shaped into a spiral and insulated from blood and tissue by a non-conductive fluid filled balloon. Initially stretched straight inside a catheter for transluminal guiding, once in place at the cardiac target, the coiled spiral antenna is advanced into the inflated balloon. Power is applied in the range of 50-150 W at the reserved industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) frequency of 915 MHz for 30-90 s to create an irreversible lesion. The antenna is then retracted back into the catheter for removal. Simulated and experimental measurements on phantoms, in vitro animal organ tissue and living animals have shown that these microwave applicators deliver the intended therapeutic lesions that are both wider and deeper than those generated by RF ablation or other recently reported microwave applicators.", "journal": "International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group", "date": "2005-01-29", "authors": ["CRappaport"], "doi": "10.1080/02656730412331286885"}

To date, little is known about the molecular events of hyperglycaemia-induced apoptosis in the heart in vivo.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg body weight streptozotocin. Caspase activities in cardiac ventricular tissue were determined using fluorometric and immunoassay caspase-activity assay kits respectively. Expression levels of proteins of the apoptotic cascade were determined with western blot analyses using specific antibodies.\nFour weeks of hyperglycaemia induced significant apoptosis in cardiac tissue. Determining the initiators of death-receptor-dependent apoptosis revealed induction of CD95/Fas and caspase-8. Examination of the activities of effector caspases revealed increased activity of caspase-6, but not caspase-3 and -7. On evaluating inhibitors of apoptosis, we found up-regulation of caspase-3 and -7-inhibiting X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis in diabetic rats. Hyperglycaemia also induced significant mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. Our evaluation of expression levels of Bcl-2 family members showed increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax in diabetic rats. Antioxidative treatment with lipoic acid significantly suppressed apoptosis and down-regulated caspase-6, -8 and -9 activity, as well as expression levels of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins without changing blood glucose levels.\nThe present study indicates that reactive oxygen species induced by high glucose are involved in both death-receptor- and mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis in the heart in vivo.

When purified from heart tissue, cardiac CSQ contains phosphate on a cluster of C-terminal serine residues, but little is known about the cellular site of kinase action, and the identity of the kinase remains uncertain. To determine basic features of the phosphorylation, we examined the reaction in canine heart preparations. CSQ phosphorylation was observed in [32P]metabolically-labeled heart cells after adenoviral overexpression, and its constitutive phosphorylation was limited to a CK2-sensitive C-terminal serine cluster. The CSQ kinase was oriented intralumenally, as was CSQ, inside membrane vesicles, such that exposure to each required detergent permeabilization. Yet even after detergent permeabilization, CSQ was phosphorylated much less efficiently by protein kinase CK2 in cardiac microsomes than was purified CSQ. Reduced phosphorylation was strongly dependent upon protein concentration, and phosphorylation time courses revealed a phosphatase activity that occurred constitutively as phosphorylated substrate accumulates. Evidence of selective dephosphorylation of CSQ glycoforms in heart homogenates was also seen by mass spectrometry analysis. Molecules with greater mannose content, a feature of early secretory pathway compartments, were more highly phosphorylated, while greater dephosphorylation was apparent in more distal compartments. Taken together, the analyses of CSQ phosphorylation in heart suggest that a constitutive process of phosphate turnover occurs for cardiac CSQ perhaps associated with its intracellular transport.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2005-01-14", "authors": ["Michal LRam", "ArashKiarash", "James DMarsh", "Steven ECala"], "doi": "10.1023/b:mcbi.0000049164.28580.56"}

E2 did not affect the contractile response to phenylepherine, dilation with acetylcholine, dilation with superoxide dismutase or constriction with l-NAME. This argues against changes in bioavailable NO.\nE2 decreases activation of p47phox and O(2)(-) production by NAD(P)H oxidase.

{"title": "Effects of BDM, [Ca2+]o, and temperature on the dynamic stiffness of quiescent cardiac trabeculae from rat.", "abstract": "Studies of the passive mechanical properties of cardiac tissue have traditionally been conducted at subphysiological temperatures and various concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](o)). More recently, the negative inotropic agent 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) has been used. However, there remains a lack of data regarding the influence of temperature, Ca(2+), and BDM on the passive mechanical properties of cardiac tissue. We have used the dynamic stiffness technique, a sensitive measurement of cross-bridge activity, in which minute (approximately 0.2% of muscle length) sinusoidal perturbations are applied at various frequencies (0.2-100 Hz) to quiescent, viable right ventricular rat trabeculae at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 26 degrees C) and at two [Ca(2+)](o) (0.5 and 1.25 mM) in the presence and absence of BDM (20 mM). The stiffness spectra (amplitude and phase) were sensitive to temperature and [Ca(2+)](o) in the absence of BDM but insensitive in the presence of BDM. From the index of cross-bridge cycling (the ratio of high- to low-frequency stiffness amplitude), we infer that BDM inhibits a small degree of spontaneous sarcomere activity, thereby allowing the true passive properties of trabeculae to be determined. In the absence of BDM, the extent of spontaneous sarcomere activity decreases with increasing temperature. We caution that the measured mechanical properties of passive cardiac tissue are critically dependent on the experimental conditions under which they are measured. Experiments must be performed at sufficiently high temperatures (>25 degrees C) to ensure a low resting concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) or in the presence of an inhibitor of cross-bridge cycling.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Therefore, there is great interest in developing viable tissue-based models for cardiac assist. Recent years have brought numerous advances in the development of scaffold-based models of cardiac tissue, but a self-organizing model has yet to be described. Here, we report the development of an in vitro cardiac tissue without scaffolding materials in the contractile region. Using an optimal concentration of the adhesion molecule laminin, a confluent layer of neonatal rat cardiomyogenic cells can be induced to self-organize into a cylindrical construct, resembling a papillary muscle, which we have termed a cardioid. Like endogenous heart tissue, cardioids contract spontaneously and can be electrically paced between 1 and 5 Hz indefinitely without fatigue. These engineered cardiac tissues also show an increased rate of spontaneous contraction (chronotropy), increased rate of relaxation (lusitropy), and increased force production (inotropy) in response to epinephrine.

In the same time period, 20 subjects of similar age not engaged in physical training or sports activities were used as the additional control group. Blood concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT), asparagine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamil transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), amylase, triglycerides, albumin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were determined for all subjects before and after the intervention period. Concentrations of LDH and ALP were increased, but concentrations of ALT, albumin, and triglycerides were decreased in the blood of trained athletes compared with healthy subjects not engaged in sports activities. In the athletes, some increases in IL-6 levels were noted; however, they were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than in patients with myocardiodystrophy. The values of IL-10 in athletes were higher than concentrations of IL-10 in patients with myocardiodystrophy but still lower than the normal values. The inhibition of IL-10 in blood may play an important role in the induction of apoptosis in cells of the heart muscle. After amino acid supplementation, the athletes' values for albumin, triglycerides, IL-10, LDH, and ALP were significantly increased compared with the post-placebo control groups. Enzyme activities of other enzymes remained unchanged in all groups.

Hearts were subjected to 40 min of global ischemia followed by 90 min of reperfusion. During ischemia, propofol (12 microg/mL in saline) was perfused through the aorta at 60 microL/min. We found that application of high-concentration propofol during ischemia combined with low-concentration propofol (1.2 microg/mL) administered before ischemia and during reperfusion significantly improved postischemic myocardial functional recovery without depressing cardiac mechanics before ischemia, as is seen when high-concentration propofol was applied prior to ischemia and during reperfusion.

Reducing Bcl-2 protein levels by using antisense oligonucleotides targeting the gene message can increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic agents. The objective of this work was to investigate the antitumor efficacy of the Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide oblimersen (Genasense; G3139), alone and in combination with vinorelbine (VNB), in an ectopic and orthotopic xenograft model of NCI-H460 human non-small-cell lung cancer. In addition to assessing therapeutic effect, Bcl-2 protein expression in tumor tissue isolated from lung and heart was measured. In the ectopic xenograft model, oblimersen at 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with saline-treated control groups, and furthermore, the antitumor effect of oblimersen was associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein in isolated tumor tissue. Moreover, the combination of oblimersen with VNB was more active in inhibiting tumor growth than either drug used alone. In the orthotopic model, oblimersen treatment (5 mg/kg) increased the median survival time of mice to 33 days in comparison with a median survival time of 21 days in the control animals. With this model, the anticancer effect was demonstrated by assessing tumor growth in lung and heart tissues by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry. When VNB at 5 mg/kg was combined with oblimersen administered at 5 mg/kg, 33% of mice survived more than 90 days.

We used intact tissue and isolated cells from heart and liver of adult rats to examine if different fixation procedures might artificially elevate the level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The basal level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in intact, freeze-clamped cardiac tissue from adult rats was 10 times higher than in isolated, non-frozen cardiomyocytes, while freeze-clamped liver contained approximately 4 times higher inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels than isolated, non-frozen hepatocytes. Stimulation with norepinephrine induced a significant increase in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate level in isolated cardiomyocytes, whereas no significant increase was observed in freeze-clamped cardiac tissue. Freezing of isolated cardiomyocytes or hepatocytes before extraction increased basal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels 3 times. In cellular homogenates prepared in the presence of EGTA and stored at 4 degrees , readdition of calcium resulted in a time-dependent increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mass and a decrease in the mass of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). The reaction was essentially complete within 30 sec. in homogenates from cardiomyocytes, while PIP(2) hydrolysis was slower in hepatocyte homogenates. Perfusion of intact rat hearts with EGTA present during the last 2 min. of perfusion, followed by freeze-clamping, resulted in basal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels comparable to those in isolated cardiomyocytes, and norepinephrine stimulation increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mass by approximately 80%. The presence of EGTA did not significantly affect PIP(2) levels in perfused hearts.

We administered a single low dose of doxorubicin (10 mg/kg of body weight, i.p.) and then isolated mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins one and four days later from the heart. Caspase-3 protein content and caspase-3 activity were significantly increased after day four of doxorubicin treatment in both male and female rats. However, while males had DNA fragmentation at day one but not day four following doxorubicin administration, females showed no significant increase in DNA fragmentation at either time. Caspase-12, localized in the SR, is considered a central caspase, and its activation by cleavage via calpain indicates activation of the SR-mediated pathway of apoptosis. Cleaved caspase-12 content and calpain activity significantly increased after day four of doxorubicin treatment in both sexes. In the mitochondrial-mediated pathway, there were no significant treatment effects observed in cytosolic cytochrome c and cleaved (active) caspase-9 in either sex. In control rats (saline injection), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production were lower in females compared to males. Doxorubicin treatment did not significantly affect H2O2, GPX activity or ATP production in isolated mitochondria in either sex. Female rats produced significantly lower levels of H2O2 production one day after doxorubicin treatment, whereas male rats produced significantly less mitochondrial H2O2 four days after doxorubicin treatment. The receptor-mediated pathway (caspase-8 and c-FLIP) showed no evidence of being significantly activated by doxorubicin treatment. Hence, doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in vivo is mediated by the SR to a greater extent than other apoptotic pathways and should therefore be considered for targeted therapeutic interventions.

Hearts were perfused ex vivo in a working mode with physiological concentrations of substrates and hormones and subjected to an adrenergic stimulation (epinephrine, 10 microM). (13)C-labeled substrates were used to assess substrate selection for energy production. Compared with control Wistar rat hearts, SHR hearts showed an impaired response to the adrenergic stimulation as reflected by 1) a smaller increase in contractility and developed pressure, 2) a faster decline in the aortic flow, and 3) greater cardiac tissue damage (lactate dehydrogenase release: 1,577 +/- 118 vs. 825 +/- 44 mU/min, P < 0.01).

Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is primarily responsible for increased myocardial mass associated with cardiac injury. Neurohumoral factors such as angiotensin-II, endothelin-1, catecholamines, and inflammatory cytokines are thought to mediate this response. U-II shares similar biological activities with other hypertrophic G(q)-coupled receptor ligands such as angiotensin-II and endothelin-1, but a role for U-II in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has not been characterized. The hypothesis of the current study was that U-II, acting through its G(q)-coupled receptor UT plays a hypertrophic role in cardiac hypertrophic remodeling. We report that adenoviral upregulation of the UT receptor \"unmasked\" U-II-induced hypertrophy in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, with a threshold response of 202+/-8 binding sites/cell. U-II was equally as efficacious as phenylephrine in inducing hypertrophy, measured by a reporter assay (EC(50) 0.7+/-0.2 nM) and [(3)H]-leucine incorporation (EC(50) 150+/-40 nM). A competitive peptidic UT receptor antagonist, BIM-23127, inhibited U-II-induced hypertrophy ( K(B) 34+/-6 nM). U-II did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis, indicating that U-II is more hypertrophic than apoptotic or hyperplastic in cardiomyocytes. U-II (10 nM) stimulated interleukin-6 release in UT-expressing cardiomyocytes (4.6-fold at 6 h). Finally, in a rat heart failure model, cardiac ventricular mRNA expression of U-II, UT receptor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1-beta is increased time-dependently following myocardial injury. These results indicate that U-II might play a role in cardiac remodeling associated with CHF by stimulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via UT, and through upregulation of inflammatory cytokines.

{"title": "Mathematical model of oxygen distribution in engineered cardiac tissue with parallel channel array perfused with culture medium containing oxygen carriers.", "abstract": "A steady-state model of oxygen distribution in a cardiac tissue construct with a parallel channel array was developed and solved for a set of parameters using the finite element method and commercial software (FEMLAB). The effects of an oxygen carrier [Oxygent; 32% volume perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion] were evaluated. The parallel channel array mimics the in vivo capillary tissue bed, and the PFC emulsion has a similar role as the natural oxygen carrier hemoglobin in increasing total oxygen content. The construct was divided into an array of cylindrical domains with a channel in the center and tissue space surrounding the channel. In the channel, the main modes of mass transfer were axial convection and radial diffusion. In the tissue region, mass transfer was by axial and radial diffusion, and the consumption of oxygen was by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Neumann boundary conditions were imposed at the channel centerline and the half distance between the domains. Supplementation of culture medium by PFC emulsion improved mass transport by increasing convective term and effective diffusivity of culture medium. The model was first implemented for the following set of experimentally obtained parameters: construct thickness of 0.2 cm, channel diameter of 330 mum, channel center-to-center spacingof 700 microm, and average linear velocity per channel of 0.049 cm/s, in conjunction with PFC supplemented and unsupplemented culture medium. Subsequently, the model was used to define favorable scaffold geometry and flow conditions necessary to cultivate cardiac constructs of high cell density (10(8) cells/ml) and clinically relevant thickness (0.5 cm). In future work, the model can be utilized as a tool for optimization of scaffold geometry and flow conditions.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of glyburide on the antioxidant enzyme activities in the heart tissue of diabetic rats. We investigated the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) in the hearts of both control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In the heart of diabetic rats, the activity of total superoxide dismutase decreased significantly (p < 0.005), whereas the activity of catalase and glutathione peroxidase increased to a large extent (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.05, respectively) at the end of the fourth week compared with the control group. Glyburide treatment of diabetic rats for 4 weeks corrected the changes observed in diabetic heart. In addition, blood glucose levels of untreated diabetic rats decreased following the glyburide treatment.

{"title": "Parallel multigrid preconditioner for the cardiac bidomain model.", "abstract": "The bidomain equations are widely used for the simulation of electrical activity in cardiac tissue but are computationally expensive, limiting the size of the problem which can be modeled. The purpose of this study is to determine more efficient ways to solve the elliptic portion of the bidomain equations, the most computationally expensive part of the computation. Specifically, we assessed the performance of a parallel multigrid (MG) preconditioner for a conjugate gradient solver. We employed an operator splitting technique, dividing the computation in a parabolic equation, an elliptical equation, and a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations at each time step. The elliptic equation was solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and the traditional block incomplete LU parallel preconditioner (ILU) was compared to MG. Execution time was minimized for each preconditioner by adjusting the fill-in factor for ILU, and by choosing the optimal number of levels for MG. The parallel implementation was based on the PETSc library and we report results for up to 16 nodes on a distributed cluster, for two and three dimensional simulations. A direct solver was also available to compare results for single processor runs. MG was found to solve the system in one third of the time required by ILU but required about 40% more memory. Thus, MG offered an attractive tradeoff between memory usage and speed, since its performance lay between those of the classic iterative methods (slow and low memory consumption) and direct methods (fast and high memory consumption). Results suggest the MG preconditioner is well suited for quickly and accurately solving the bidomain equations.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2004-11-13", "authors": ["RodrigoWeber dos Santos", "GernotPlank", "SteffenBauer", "Edward JVigmond"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2004.834275"}
{"title": "Microelectrode arrays: a new tool to measure embryonic heart activity.", "abstract": "The analysis of the sequential excitation of cardiac tissue is of high relevance, both for clinical pathophysiological purposes, eg, detection of sustained ventricular arrhythmias, as well as for experimental electrophysiology. Clinically, different technical approaches such as single electrode measurements and bipolar mapping electrode catheters have been used. In experimental setups several techniques to record cardiac activity have been proposed. Beside the well-established intracellular current-clamp recordings of action potentials, recent studies have performed extracellularly activation sequence mapping or simultaneous multichannel action potential electrode array measurements. Measurement of extracellularly recorded field potentials (FPs) hereby especially provides detailed information about the origin and spread of excitation in the heart. A similar analytical approach for cardiac FPs advanced the analysis of excitation spread and arrhythmic activity in multicellular preparations like developmental differentiation tissue of mouse embryonic stem cells, multicellular preparations of isolated native embryonic cardiomyocytes or the embryonic heart in toto. The use of substrate-integrated Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) with 60 electrodes of 10-30 microm diameters on a 100-200 microm grid, coated with porous titanium nitride to minimize the impedance allows recording of FPs at a high signal to noise ratio. The possibility to electrically stimulate the tissue further expands the range of applications and bioassays. It may thus facilitate the evaluation of drug research providing detailed information about the interplay of the complex cardiac network, and might improve the predictability of physiological and pathophysiological conditions or drug effects in embryonic heart tissue.", "journal": "Journal of electrocardiology", "date": "2004-11-10", "authors": ["MichaelReppel", "FrankPillekamp", "Zhong JuLu", "MarcelHalbach", "KonradBrockmeier", "Bernd KFleischmann", "JuergenHescheler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2004.08.033"}

The survival of EPCR(delta/delta) mice was significantly diminished as compared to WT mice after administration of LPS via this route. Heart rates and central blood pressures also were significantly more depressed in EPCR(delta/delta) mice, indicating that the receptor-based protein C (PC) pathway functions in regulation of hemodynamic properties in the mouse. Further, heart muscle damage was more severe in EPCR(delta/delta) mice as compared to WT mice after endotoxin administration, as revealed by the more elevated plasma myoglobin levels in EPCR(delta/delta) mice and by microscopic examination of stained heart sections. Neutrophil infiltration was more pronounced in heart tissue of EPCR(delta/delta) mice, perhaps in response to the greatly increased expression level of the chemokine, MIP-2, which also significantly more up-regulated in the LPS-treated EPCR(delta/delta) mouse cohort. In conclusion, a severe deficiency of EPCR adversely affects survival of mice subjected to continuous infusion of endotoxin, via contributions of more responsive hemodynamic and cardiac alterations, thus suggesting that, among its other functions, the PC-based receptor system has a cardioprotective role after acute inflammatory challenge.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2004-11-06", "authors": ["TakayukiIwaki", "Diana TCruz", "J AndrewMartin", "Francis JCastellino"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2004-06-2456"}

Although various factors have been identified as possible causes of different cardiac diseases such as heart failure and ischemic heart disease, there is a real need to elucidate their role for the better understanding of the cardiac disease pathology and formulation of strategies for developing newer therapeutic interventions. In view of the intimate involvement of different types of proteases in maintaining cellular structure, the role of proteases in various cardiac diseases has become the focus of recent research. Proteases are present in the cytosol as well as are localized in a number of subcellular organelles in the cell. These are known to use extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal, sarcolemmal, sarcoplasmic reticular, mitochondrial and myofibrillar proteins as substrates. Work from different laboratories using a wide variety of techniques has shown that the activation of proteases causes alterations of a number of specific proteins leading to subcellular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. Inhibition of protease action by different drugs and agents, therefore, has a clinical relevance and is expected to form a part of new treatment paradigm for improving heart function.

However, whether intramyocardial lipid deposition is a feature of human heart failure remains to be established. We hypothesized that intramyocardial lipid accumulation is a common feature of non-ischemic heart failure and is associated with changes in gene expression similar to those found in an animal model of lipotoxicity. Intramyocardial lipid staining with oil red O and gene expression analysis was performed on heart tissue from 27 patients (9 female) with non-ischemic heart failure. We determined intramyocardial lipid, gene expression, and contractile function in hearts from 6 Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and 6 Zucker lean (ZL) rats. Intramyocardial lipid overload was present in 30% of non-ischemic failing hearts. The highest levels of lipid staining were observed in patients with diabetes and obesity (BMI>30). Intramyocardial lipid deposition was associated with an up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) -regulated genes, myosin heavy chain beta (MHC-beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Intramyocardial lipid overload in the hearts of ZDF rats was associated with contractile dysfunction and changes in gene expression similar to changes found in failing human hearts with lipid overload.

All current systems use low-polarization electrodes and no beat to beat detection system is available for all types of electrodes. In addition the success ratio for currently available systems is not always 100%. Failure to detect capture reliably is often related to the behaviour of the electrode-tissue interface under different circumstances. Pacemaker electrodes can be considered electrochemical cells with complicated characteristics depending on time, temperature and electrical charge. This electrochemical cell is disturbed when a charge is transferred across the electrode-tissue interface during pacing. Several measures can be taken in order to minimise this disturbance or pace polarization artefact (PPA) including the use of high active surface area electrodes and application of tri-phasic pacing pulses. Another factor influencing detection of evoked potentials is the input circuit of the pacemaker affecting the PPA and the evoked response. Positive PPAs can be falsely interpreted as evoked potentials due to the undershoot of the second order filters applied in modern cardiac pacemakers.

In addition, as has been proposed elsewhere, the binding of T. cruzi to tissues may turn them into targets for parasite-specific immune reactions. Washed heart sections from T. cruzi-infected mice were subjected to immunoenzymatic staining with antisera against whole T. cruzi and with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against TS.

In particular, heart tissue can support stationary and meandering spirals of electrical excitation, which have been shown to underlie different forms of cardiac arrhythmias. In contrast to single-arm spirals, stable multiarm spirals (multiple spiral waves that rotate in the same direction around a common organizing center) have not been demonstrated and studied yet in living excitable tissues. Here, we show that persistent multiarm spirals of electrical activity can be induced in monolayer cultures of neonatal rat heart cells by a short, rapid train of electrical point stimuli applied during single-arm-spiral activity. Stable formation is accomplished only in monolayers that show a relatively broad and steep dependence of impulse wavelength and propagation velocity on rate of excitation. The resulting multiarm spirals emit waves of electrical activity at rates faster than for single-arm spirals and exhibit two distinct behaviors, namely \"arm-switching\" and \"tip-switching.\" The phenomenon of rate acceleration due to an increase in the number of spiral arms possibly may underlie the acceleration of functional reentrant tachycardias paced by a clinician or an antitachycardia device.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2004-10-20", "authors": ["NenadBursac", "FelipeAguel", "LeslieTung"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0400984101"}

{"title": "How hematopoietic stem cells know and act in cardiac microenvironment for stem cell plasticity? Impact of local renin-angiotensin systems.", "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can exhibit tremendous differentiation activity in numerous non-hematopoietic organs. This enigmatic process is called as 'stem cell plasticity' (SCP). HSC may promote structural and functional repair in several organs such as heart, liver, brain, and skeletal muscle via the SCP. The differentiation capacity of HSC is dependent on the specific signals present in the local tissue microenvironment. Those specific molecular signals required for the interactions of HSC and host tissues are currently unknown. The aim of this report is to propose a hypothesis on how HSC reach, recognize, and function in cardiac tissues in the context of SCP. Locally signaling cardiac microenvironment is essential for the seeding, expansion, and 'cardiomyocyte differentiation' of the HSC in the heart. Our hypothesis is that the receptors, ligands, and signaling pathways of the tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) serve as the link between HSC and local cardiac microenvironment in SCP. The RAS is considered as a 'tissue-based system' exhibiting paracrine functions within many organs. The presence of local hematopoietic bone marrow RAS and local cardiac RAS have been suggested. Both local tissue RASs share similar angiotensin peptide-signaling pathways such as JAK-STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinases. HSC have angiotensin type I (AT1a) receptors for the binding of angiotensin II, the active component of the RAS. Binding of angiotensin II to AT1a can increase hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. Local cardiac RAS has critical (patho)biological functions in the cardiomyocyte survival, renewal, and growth, as well as in cardiac remodeling. Therefore, the components of the local cardiac RAS and hematopoietic RAS could interact with each other during the SCP through myocardial tissue repair. Activation of the local myocardial RAS after injury may be related to homing and engraftment of the HSC to the cardiac tissue. Regenerating myocardial tissue may exert regulatory functions on circulating or resident HSC via the locally active RAS. Understanding the exact molecular basis of SCP in relation to local tissue RAS could offer new frontiers in the better management of ischemic cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2004-10-19", "authors": ["M AkifOzt\u00fcrk", "G\u00fclay SainG\u00fcven", "Ibrahim CHaznedaroglu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2004.04.011"}

Carnitine treatment resulted in dramatic improvement of the cardiac symptoms, echocardiographic, and EKG findings in both cases. Family investigations revealed four sudden deaths, two of them corresponded to the classic SIDS phenotype. In postmortem tissue specimens available from three of them we could verify the homozygous mutation. In liver tissue reserved from two patients lipid droplet vacuolization could be observed; the lipid vacuoles were located mainly in the peripherolobular regions of the acini. In the heart tissue signs of generalized hypertrophy and lipid vacuoles were seen predominantly in the subendocardial areas in both cases; some aggregates of smaller lipid vacuoles were separated, apparently by membranes. Review of all OCTN2 deficiency cases reported so far revealed that this is the first presentation of histopathology in classic familial sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) with an established SLC22A5 mutation. In addition to the two affected homozygous cardiomyopathic children and three homozygous sudden death patients, the genetic analysis in 25 relatives showed 14 carriers.

There are at least two thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin systems participating in the cellular defense against oxygen radicals. At present, relatively little is known about the contribution of individual enzymes to the redox metabolism in different cell types. To begin to address this question, we generated and characterized mice lacking functional mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TrxR2). Ubiquitous Cre-mediated inactivation of TrxR2 is associated with embryonic death at embryonic day 13. TrxR2(TrxR2(-/-)minus;/TrxR2(-/-)minus;) embryos are smaller and severely anemic and show increased apoptosis in the liver. The size of hematopoietic colonies cultured ex vivo is dramatically reduced. TrxR2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts are highly sensitive to endogenous oxygen radicals when glutathione synthesis is inhibited. Besides the defect in hematopoiesis, the ventricular heart wall of TrxR2(TrxR2(-/-)minus;/TrxR2(-/-)minus;) embryos is thinned and proliferation of cardiomyocytes is decreased. Cardiac tissue-restricted ablation of TrxR2 results in fatal dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition reminiscent of that in Keshan disease and Friedreich's ataxia.

Given such a link, termination of alternans may help prevent the onset of arrhythmias. To this end, recent efforts have shown that chaos control methods can modulate the timing of electrical stimulation to eliminate alternans.\nWe have developed an alternative control method founded entirely in cardiac electrophysiology (rather than borrowing techniques from the control of physical systems as with existing control techniques). Using computer simulations, we show that this method, which exploits the rate-dependent behavior of cardiac tissue, can be used to control alternans (and higher-order) rhythms, and is robust to drift and noise. When applied to individual model cells exhibiting alternans, the algorithm converges to the period-1 rhythm over as wide, and in some cases a wider, range of feedback proportionality constant values relative to existing methods. Control success comparable to existing methods is achieved when the algorithm is applied to a simulated one-dimensional Purkinje fiber exhibiting alternans.\nWe have developed a method that adaptively controls the timing of electrical stimulation to rapidly eliminate action potential duration alternans in cardiac tissue.

The objective of this study was to determine if the protection demonstrated by carvedilol (CV), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with strong antioxidant properties, against DOX-induced mitochondrial-mediated cardiomyopathy [Toxicol.

Our results confirm that DOX induces oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and histopathological lesions in the cardiac tissue, all of which are inhibited by carvedilol. In contrast, atenolol (AT), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist lacking antioxidant properties, preserved phosphate energy charge but failed to protect against any of the indexes of DOX-induced oxidative mitochondrial toxicity.

The mRNA of TH and PNMP was also detected in fetal rat hearts before sympathetic innervation. Immunoreactivity of norepinephrine transporter (NET) was localized to ICA cells in rat heart tissue and primary cell culture. For the functional study, the activity of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients was quantified by a ratio fluorescent spectrometer in cultured ICA cells and myocytes.

[3H]norepinephrine studies demonstrate release and uptake of norepinephrine. Functional interaction between catecholamines produced by the ICA cells and cocultured myocytes was evident by the effect of the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol eliciting a dose-dependent reduction in the amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i transients of beating myocytes. Hypoxia inhibited [Ca2+]i transient activity of ICA cells, which subsequently produced a reoxygenation-mediated rebound augmentation of [Ca2+]i transients. We conclude that ICA cells are capable of catecholamine synthesis, release, and uptake. They generate spontaneous [Ca2+]i transient activity that can be regulated by oxygen tension.

The inhibition of caspase activity in vivo by the use of pharmacologic agents as well as genetic manipulation reduced virus-induced myocardial injury by 40 to 60% and dramatically improved survival in infected caspase-3-deficient animals.

Thus, we characterized the effects of several selective CYPomega-hydroxylase inhibitors and a CYPomega-hydroxylase metabolite of AA, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), on the extent of ischemia-reperfusion injury in canine hearts. During 60 minutes of ischemia and particularly after 3 hours of reperfusion, 20-HETE was produced at high concentrations. A nonspecific CYP inhibitor, miconazole, and 2 specific CYPomega-hydroxylase inhibitors, 17-octadecanoic acid (17-ODYA) and N-methylsulfonyl-12,12-dibromododec-11-enamide (DDMS), markedly inhibited 20-HETE production during ischemia-reperfusion and produced a profound reduction in myocardial infarct size (expressed as a percent of the area at risk) (19.6+/-1.7% [control], 8.4+/-2.5% [0.96 mg/kg miconazole], 5.9+/-2.2% [0.28 mg/kg 17-ODYA], and 10.8+/-1.8% [0.40 mg/kg DDMS], P<0.05, respectively). Conversely, exogenous 20-HETE administration significantly increased infarct size (26.9+/-1.9%, P<0.05). Several CYPomega-hydroxylase isoforms, which are known to produce 20-HETE such as CYP4A1, CYP4A2, and CYP4F, were demonstrated to be present in canine heart tissue and their activity was markedly inhibited by incubation with 17-ODYA.

{"title": "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor mediates late cardiac dysfunction after burn injury.", "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a myocardial depressant protein and that MIF mediates late, prolonged cardiac dysfunction after endotoxin challenge in mice. Because many factors, including endotoxin, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction after burn injury, we tested the hypothesis that MIF might also be the mediator of prolonged cardiac dysfunction in this model. At 4 h after 40% total body surface area burn in anesthetized mice, serum MIF levels increased significantly compared with baseline (2.2-fold). This increase was accompanied by a significant decrease in cardiac tissue MIF levels (2.1-fold decrease compared with controls). This pattern was consistent with MIF release from preformed cytoplasmic stores in the heart and other organs. To determine whether MIF mediates cardiac dysfunction after burn injury, mice were pretreated with anti-MIF neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or isotype control antibodies. Beginning 4 h after burn injury (and continuing through 48 h), burned mice demonstrated a significantly depressed left ventricular shortening fraction of 38.6 +/- 1.8%, compared with the normal controls (56.0 +/- 2.6%). Mice treated with anti-MIF displayed an initial depression of cardiac function similar to nontreated animals but then showed rapid restoration of cardiac function with complete recovery by 24 h, which persisted for the duration of the protocol. This study is the first to demonstrate that MIF mediates late, prolonged cardiac dysfunction after burn injury and suggests that MIF blockade should be considered a therapeutic target for the treatment of burn injury.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We have developed an in vivo lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer system to study the physiological functions of the AT2R. Our objectives in this study were to determine whether the AT2R influences cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial and perivascular fibrosis in a nongenetic rat model of hypertension. Lentiviral vector containing the AT2R or saline was injected intracardially in 5-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. This resulted in a persistent overexpression of the AT2R in cardiac tissues. At 15 wk of age, animals were infused with either 200 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) of angiotensin II or saline by implantation of a 4-wk osmotic minipump. This resulted in an increase in blood pressure (BP) that reached maximal by 2 wk of treatment and was associated with a 123% increase in left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) and a 129% increase in heart weight to body weight ratios (HW/BW). In addition, the increase in cardiac hypertrophy was associated with a 300% and 158% increase in myocardial and perivascular fibrosis, respectively. Cardiac transduction of the AT2R resulted in an 85% attenuation of LVWT, 91% attenuation of HW/BW, and a 43% decrease in myocardial fibrosis induced by angiotensin infusion. These improvements in cardiac pathology were observed in the absence of attenuation of high BP.

{"title": "Determining the effects of memory and action potential duration alternans on cardiac restitution using a constant-memory restitution protocol.", "abstract": "Restitution, the dependence of action potential duration (APD) on diastolic interval, may be causally linked to the vulnerability of cardiac tissue to certain types of arrhythmias. While a number of pacing protocols are commonly used to quantify the restitution relation, one of these, the dynamic protocol, may result in the occurrence of APD alternans. However, the effects of APD alternans, and the concomitant alternation in cardiac memory, on the restitution curve are currently not well understood. Alternans preceding a given action potential may cause that action potential to have a different duration from one preceded by action potentials of identical duration. This interaction of alternans and memory can result in a dynamic restitution curve that is not unique. To address this, we have developed a constant-memory restitution protocol that enables the experimenter or modeller to obtain unique, constant-memory restitution curves at all diastolic intervals. Using this protocol, we obtained unique restitution curves for two ionic models of the cardiac action potential in the absence of alternans at all diastolic intervals. A comparison of the unique constant-memory and non-unique dynamic restitution curves for the two models shows that the presence of alternans can significantly alter the shape of the restitution curve compared to when alternans is absent.", "journal": "Physiological measurement", "date": "2004-09-24", "authors": ["Peter NJordan", "David JChristini"], "doi": "10.1088/0967-3334/25/4/018"}

It was the aim of the present study to investigate whether the reduced plasma cholesterol levels in sPLA2-transgenic mice may be due to an increased transfer of lipids from sPLA2-modified lipoproteins to the liver and/or other nonvascular tissues. Ten sPLA2-transgenic mice and an equal number of nontransgenic littermates were fed a cholesterol-enriched (1%) diet for 13 weeks. After autopsy, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured in homogenates of liver, spleen, kidney, and myocardial tissues. Compared to the nontransgenic controls, the sPLA2-transgenic mice exhibited significantly lower plasma cholesterol levels, which was due to a reduction in both HDL and beta-lipoprotein (LDL + beta-VLDL) cholesterol. Liver tissues from the transgenic mice were found to contain significantly increased concentrations of free and esterified cholesterol, which was not associated with increased triglyceride concentrations. Spleen, kidney, and heart tissues of the two animal groups showed no significant differences in cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations. The findings suggest that the overexpression of human secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA leads to an enhanced delivery of cholesterol from phospholipolysed lipoproteins to the liver.

{"title": "Treatment of inoperable coronary disease and refractory angina: spinal stimulators, epidurals, gene therapy, transmyocardial laser, and counterpulsation.", "abstract": "Intractable angina from refractory coronary disease is a severe form of myocardial ischemia for which revascularization provides no prognostic benefit. Inoperable coronary disease is also accompanied by a \"vicious cycle\" of myocardial dystrophy from a chronic alteration of the cardiac sympathetic tone and sensitization of damaged cardiac tissues. Several adjunctive treatments have demonstrated efficacy when revascularization is either unsuccessful or contraindicated. Spinal cord stimulation modifies the neurologic input and output of the heart by delivering a very low dose of electrical current to the dorsal columns of the high thoracic spinal cord. Neural fibers then release CGRP and other endogenous peptides to the coronary circulation reducing myocardial oxygen demand and enhancing vasodilation of collaterals to improve the myocardial blood flow of the most diseased regions of the heart. Randomized study has shown the survival data at five years is comparable to bypass for high-risk patients. Transmyocardial laser revascularization creates small channels into ischemic myocardium in an effort to enhance flow though studies have shown no improvement in prognosis over medical therapy alone. Enhanced external counterpulsation uses noninvasive pneumatic compression of the legs to improve diastolic filling of the coronary vessels and promote development of collateral flow. The compressor regimen requires thirty-five hours of therapy over a seven-week treatment period. Therapeutic angiogenesis requires injection of cytokines to promote neovascularization and improve myocardial perfusion into the regions affected by chronic ischemia. Phase 3 trials are pending. High thoracic epidural blockade produces a rapid and potent sympatholysis, coronary vasodilation and reduced myocardial oxygen demand in refractory coronary disease. This technique can be used as an adjunct to bypass surgery or medical therapy in chronic or acute unstable angina. Epidurals are easy to perform and often available for outpatient or inpatient use. The rapid anti-ischemic effect may complement therapeutic angiogenesis or other interventions with delayed onset to clinical benefit. A new era for interventional and implant cardiology is beginning to emerge as more clinicians, including cardiologists, gradually learn new procedures to safely provide more therapeutic options for patients suffering refractory angina.", "journal": "Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia", "date": "2004-09-17", "authors": ["NelsonSvorkdal"], "doi": "10.1177/108925320400800109"}

To investigate the cardiotoxicity of transplacentally administered zidovudine (AZT) or AZT plus lamivudine (3TC) in the absence of HIV infection, we evaluated several biomarkers of cardiac mitochondrial structure and cardiac structure and function in a B6C3F1 mouse model. In utero exposure to AZT-3TC resulted in ultrastructural pathology, loss of mitochondria, and altered echocardiographic measurements in newborn mice. Cardiac pathology and dysfunction persisted into the adult life of female mice exposed in utero to AZT, as evidenced by significant dose-dependent heart enlargement, clusters of atypical mitochondria and myofibril alterations, significantly increased cytochrome c oxidase activity, and significantly higher numbers of mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes compared with unexposed controls at 18 to 24 mo of age. These data led to the hypothesis that the long-term pathology of peri-natal exposure to these NRTIs is related to persistent mitochondrial DNA mutations in cardiac tissue; that is, the primary damage during drug treatment is mutational (as opposed to affecting polymerase gamma and/or other mitochondrial elements) and leads over time to delayed, progressive cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2004-09-17", "authors": ["Dale MWalker", "Miriam CPoirier", "Matthew JCampen", "Dennis LCook", "Rao LDivi", "KunioNagashima", "Amie KLund", "Patsy YCossey", "Fletcher FHahn", "Vernon EWalker"], "doi": "10.1385/ct:4:2:133"}

In vitro, the alpha4beta1-dependent neurite outgrowth on VCAM-1 decreased by approximately 50% from postnatal day 1 to 6. This down-regulation was correlated with a shift in alpha4 isoform and a shift in alpha4 localization from neurites to cell bodies. This altered localization was also observed in vivo but on a different time scale. alpha4 was detected on most developing SCG neurons and on macrophages and blood vessels. In the heart, alpha4 was detected on sympathetic axons, but the percentage of alpha4-positive fibers decreased with age. VCAM-1 immunoreactivity was abundant in heart tissue throughout development, in close proximity to sympathetic axons.

{"title": "Omega-3 fatty acids in cardiac biopsies from heart transplantation patients: correlation with erythrocytes and response to supplementation.", "abstract": "Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) appear to reduce the risk of sudden death from myocardial infarction. This reduction is believed to occur via the incorporation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into the myocardium itself, altering the dynamics of sodium and calcium channel function. The extent of incorporation has not been determined in humans.\nWe first determined the correlation between red blood cell (RBC) and cardiac omega-3 FA levels in 20 heart transplant recipients. We then examined the effects of 6 months of omega-3 FA supplementation (1 g/d) on the FA composition of human cardiac and buccal tissue, RBCs, and plasma lipids in 25 other patients. Cardiac and RBC EPA+DHA levels were highly correlated (r=0.82, P<0.001). Supplementation increased EPA+DHA levels in cardiac tissue by 110%, in RBCs by 101%, in plasma by 139%, and in cheek cells by 73% (P<0.005 versus baseline for all; responses among tissues were not significantly different).\nAlthough any of the tissues examined could serve as a surrogate for cardiac omega-3 FA content, RBC EPA+DHA was highly correlated with cardiac EPA+DHA; the RBC omega-3 response to supplementation was similar to that of the heart; RBCs are easily collected and analyzed; and they have a less variable FA composition than plasma. Therefore, RBC EPA+DHA (also called the Omega-3 Index) may be the preferred surrogate for cardiac omega-3 FA status.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2004-09-09", "authors": ["William SHarris", "Scott ASands", "Sheryl LWindsor", "Hakim AAli", "Tracy LStevens", "AnthonyMagalski", "Charles BPorter", "A MichaelBorkon"], "doi": "10.1161/01.CIR.0000142292.10048.B2"}

Despite much study, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of dHAND activity are not well understood. We therefore carried out yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length dHAND as bait, which led to identification of several dHAND-binding proteins, including three E-proteins: E2A, ME2, and ALF1. Subsequent analysis revealed that although their heterodimerization and transcriptional activities were similar, dHAND/E-protein heterodimers bind to an E-box element with differing affinities, suggesting they have distinct DNA binding specificities. Moreover, in situ hybridization showed that E-protein genes are expressed fairly ubiquitously among embryonic tissues, including the branchial arches and limb buds. By contrast, little signal was detected in the heart, suggesting that dHAND complexes with partners other than E-proteins in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2004-09-08", "authors": ["MasaoMurakami", "KeiichiroKataoka", "JunjiTominaga", "OsamuNakagawa", "HirokiKurihara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.072"}
{"title": "A-kinase anchoring protein targeting of protein kinase A in the heart.", "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that subcellular targeting of signaling molecules is an important means of regulating the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Subcellular organization of the signaling molecules in the PKA pathway insures that a signal initiated at the receptor level is transferred efficiently to a PKA substrate eliciting some cellular response. This subcellular targeting appears to regulate the function of a highly specialized cell such as the cardiac myocyte. This review focuses on A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) which are expressed in the heart. It has been determined that, of the approximately 13 different AKAPs expressed in cardiac tissue, several of these are expressed in cardiac myocytes. These AKAPs bind several PKA substrates and some appear to regulate PKA-dependent phosphorylation of these substrates. AKAP tethering of PKA may be essential for efficient regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. The ability of an AKAP to anchor PKA may be altered in the failing heart, thus compromising the ability of the myocyte to respond to stimuli which elicit the PKA pathway.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2004-09-08", "authors": ["Mary LRuehr", "Mary ARussell", "MeredithBond"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.04.017"}
{"title": "Micro-electrode arrays in cardiac safety pharmacology: a novel tool to study QT interval prolongation.", "abstract": "Drug-induced QT interval prolongation is now a major concern in safety pharmacology. Regulatory authorities such as the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency require in vitro testing of all drug candidates against the potential risk for QT interval prolongation prior to clinical trials. Common in vitro methods include organ models (Langendorff heart), conventional electrophysiology on cardiac myocytes, and heterologous expression systems of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels. A novel approach is to study electrophysiological properties of cultured cardiac myocytes by micro-electrode arrays (MEA). This technology utilises multi channel recording from an array of embedded substrate-integrated extracellular electrodes using cardiac tissue from the ventricles of embryonic chickens. The detected field potentials allow a partial reconstruction of the shape and time course of the underlying action potential. In particular, the duration of action potentials of ventricular myocytes is closely related to the QT interval on an ECG. This novel technique was used to study reference substances with a reported QT interval prolonging effect. These substances were E4031, amiodarone, quinidine and sotalol. These substances show a significant prolongation of the field potential. However, verapamil, a typical 'false positive' when using the hERG assay does not cause any field potential prolongation using the MEA assay. Whereas the heterologous hERG assay limits cardiac repolarisation to just one channel, the MEA assay reflects the full range of mechanisms involved in cardiac action potential regulation. In summary, screening compounds in cardiac myocytes with the MEA technology against QT interval prolongation can overcome the problem of a single cell assay to potentially report 'false positives'.", "journal": "Drug safety", "date": "2004-09-08", "authors": ["ThomasMeyer", "Karl-HeinzBoven", "ElkeG\u00fcnther", "MichaelFejtl"], "doi": "10.2165/00002018-200427110-00002"}

In vivo mixed lymphocyte reactions showed that 4-1BB was preferentially expressed on actively dividing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, following alloantigen challenge, the draining lymph nodes contained subpopulations of 4-1BB-expressing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. 4-1BB-deficient C57BL/6 mice showed a delayed rejection of cardiac transplants mismatched for the major histocompatibility complex. Longer transplant survival was induced by blockade of 4-1BB/4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) interactions using an anti-4-1BBL monoclonal antibody. Histological analysis showed that prolonged transplant survival in the 4-1BB-deficient and anti-4-1BBL-treated mice correlated with reduced lymphocytic infiltration and vasculitis in the donor heart tissue. Taken together, our data suggest that blockade of 4-1BB/4-1BBL interactions inhibited the expansion of alloreactive T cells and reduced CTL activity against host alloantigen, which in turn resulted in the prolongation of allograft survival.

{"title": "PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone ameliorates ventricular dysfunction in experimental chronic mitral regurgitation.", "abstract": "Previously we reported that the beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blockade in chronic mitral regurgitation (MR) were in part due to induction of bradycardia, which obviously affects myocardial energy requirements. From this observation we hypothesized that part of the pathophysiology of MR may involve faulty energy substrate utilization, which in turn might lead to potentially harmful lipid accumulation as observed in other models of heart failure. To explore this hypothesis, we measured triglyceride accumulation in the myocardia of dogs with chronic MR and then attempted to enhance myocardial metabolism by chronic administration of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist rosiglitazone. Cardiac tissues were obtained from three groups of dogs that included control animals, dogs with MR for 3 mo without treatment, and dogs with MR for 6 mo that were treated with rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) for the last 3 mo of observation. Hemodynamics and contractile function (end-systolic stress-strain relationship, as measured by K index) were assessed at baseline, 3 mo of MR, and 6 mo of MR (3 mo of the treatment). Lipid accumulation in MR (as indicated by oil red O staining score and TLC analysis) was marked and showed an inverse correlation with the left ventricular (LV) contractility. LV contractility was significantly restored after PPAR therapy (K index: therapy, 3.01 +/- 0.11*; 3 mo MR, 2.12 +/- 0.34; baseline, 4.01 +/- 0.29; ANOVA, P = 0.038; *P < 0.05 vs. 3 mo of MR). At the same time, therapy resulted in a marked reduction of intramyocyte lipid. We conclude that 1) chronic MR leads to intramyocyte myocardial lipid accumulation and contractile dysfunction, and 2) administration of the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone ameliorates MR-induced LV dysfunction accompanied by a decline in lipid content.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The disease is characterized by accumulation of aspartylglucosamine (GlcNAc-Asn) and other glycoasparagines in tissues and body fluids of AGU patients and in an AGU mouse model. In the current study, we characterized a glycoasparagine carrying the tetrasaccharide moiety of alpha-D-Man-(1-->6)-beta-D-Man-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->N)-Asn (Man2GlcNAc2-Asn) in urine of an AGU patient and also in the tissues of the AGU mouse model. Quantitative analysis demonstrated a massive accumulation of the compound especially in nonneuronal tissues of the AGU mice, in which the levels of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn were typically 30-87% of those of GlcNAc-Asn. The highest level of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn was found in the liver, spleen, and heart tissues of the AGU mice, the respective amounts being 87%, 76%, and 57% of the GlcNAc-Asn levels. In the brain tissue of AGU mice the Man2GlcNAc2-Asn storage was only 9% of that of GlcNAc-Asn. In contrast to GlcNAc-Asn, the storage of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn markedly increased in the liver and spleen tissues of AGU mice as they grew older. Enzyme replacement therapy with glycosylasparaginase for 3.5 weeks reduced the amount of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn by 66-97% in nonneuronal tissues, but only by 13% in the brain tissue of the AGU mice.

{"title": "Phosphorylation and alternative pre-mRNA splicing converge to regulate myocyte enhancer factor 2C activity.", "abstract": "Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors play pivotal roles in cardiac, muscle, and neuron gene expression. All products of MEF2 genes have a common amino-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain, but the four vertebrate MEF2 gene transcripts are alternatively spliced among coding exons to produce splicing isoforms. In MEF2C alone, alternative splice acceptors in the last exon give forms that include or exclude a short domain that we designate gamma. We show that MEF2C is expressed exclusively as gamma- isoforms in heart tissue and predominantly as gamma- in other adult tissues and in differentiating myocytes. MEF2C gamma- isoforms are much more robust than gamma+ forms in activating MEF2-responsive reporters in transfected fibroblasts despite indistinguishable expression levels, and they better synergize with MyoD in promoting myogenic conversion. One-hybrid transcription assays using Gal4-MEF2C fusions give similar distinctions between gamma- and gamma+ isoforms in all cell types tested, including myocytes. Cis effects of gamma on MEF2C DNA binding, dimerization, protein stability, or response to CaM or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling are not apparent, and the isolated gamma domain represses transcription when fused to Gal4. One phosphoserine residue is present within the gamma domain according to tandem mass spectrometry, and mutation of this residue abolishes gamma-mediated transrepression. A similar activity is present in the constitutive gamma domain and serine phosphoacceptor of MEF2A. Our findings indicate that gamma functions autonomously as a phosphoserine-dependent transrepressor to downregulate transactivation function of MEF2 factors and that alternative splicing and serine phosphorylation converge to provide complex combinatorial control of MEF2C activity.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2004-09-02", "authors": ["BangminZhu", "TodGulick"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.24.18.8264-8275.2004"}

Broilers susceptible to PHS experience sustained elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and ultimately heart failure. Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial function is defective in broilers with PHS; they use oxygen less efficiently than broilers without PHS. In this study mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) protein levels were compared in cardiac tissues from PHS resistant and susceptible line broilers using quantitative immunoblots. Seven of 9 anti-mammalian mitochondrial ETC protein antibodies tested exhibited cross-species reactivity. Six ETC proteins were differentially expressed in the right ventricles of broilers raised under simulated high altitude conditions (2,900 m above sea level). Four ETC proteins were present at higher levels in resistant line birds without PHS than in resistant line birds with PHS or in susceptible line birds with or without PHS. One ETC protein was present at higher levels in broilers without PHS than in broilers with PHS in both lines, and one ETC protein was present at lower levels in susceptible line birds without PHS than in susceptible line birds with PHS or in resistant line birds with or without PHS. Interestingly, differential expression of mitochondrial ETC proteins was not observed in the right ventricles of broilers raised at local altitude (390 m above sea level) nor was it observed in the left ventricles of broilers exposed to simulated high altitude.

The augmented expression of CC chemokines, especially CCL5/RANTES and CCL3/MIP-1alpha, in the hearts of infected mice suggests a role for CC chemokines and their receptors in the pathogenesis of T cruzi-elicited myocarditis.\nWe report that during the early phase of infection in C3H/HeJ mice infected with 100 blood trypomastigotes of T cruzi, most of the inflammatory cells invading the heart tissue were CD8+ cells and expressed CCR5, a CCL5/RANTES, and CCL3/MIP1-alpha receptor. Furthermore, peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes displayed increased expression of CCR5. These findings led us to use Met-RANTES, a selective CCR1 and CCR5 antagonist, to modulate the acute T cruzi-elicited myocarditis. Met-RANTES treatment did not interfere with parasitism but significantly decreased the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CCR5+, and interleukin-4+ cells invading the heart, paralleling the diminished deposition of fibronectin. Moreover, Met-RANTES treatment resulted in increased survival of infected animals, compared with saline treatment.\nThese results indicate that the massive influx of CCR5+ cells into cardiac tissue is not crucial for cell-mediated anti-T cruzi immunity but appears to be critical for pathogenesis of T cruzi-elicited myocarditis.

We believe that there is a unique failure of the damaged myocardium to provide the appropriate molecular signals for stem cells engraftment related to age. Our hypothesis is that the overexpression of IL-10 in the aged population reduces cardiac cellular proliferation subsequent to myocardial injury. This hypothesis is supported by aging models, where elevated levels of IL-10 are associated with reduced healing response to noncardiac tissue injury. We demonstrated an increased cardiac gene expression of IL-10 that may be associated with a reduced proliferative response in the border regions of the infarcted myocardium that are proportional with age.

Female Fischer rats were fed either a HFS diet or standard low-fat, complex-carbohydrate chow starting at 2 mo of age for 7 mo. Vasoconstrictive response to KCl and phenylephrine was similar in both groups. Vasorelaxation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired in the HFS animals, and there were no differences in relaxation to sodium nitroprusside, suggesting that the endothelial dysfunction is due, at least in part, to nitric oxide deficiency. HFS consumption decreased protein expression of endothelial NOS in aorta, renal, and heart tissues, neuronal NOS in kidney, heart, aorta, and brain, and inducible NOS in heart and aorta. Caveolin-1 and soluble guanylate cyclase protein expression did not change, but AKT protein expression decreased in heart and aorta and increased in kidney tissue. Consumption of HFS diet raised brain carbonyl content and plasma hydrogen peroxide concentration and diminished plasma total antioxidant capacity. Because blood pressure, which is known to eventually rise in this model, was not as yet significantly elevated, the present data suggest that endothelial dysfunction precedes the onset of diet-induced hypertension. The lack of a quantitative change in caveolin-1 and soluble guanylate cyclase protein content indicates that alteration in these proteins is not responsible for the endothelial dysfunction.

Early events in viral infection include attachment of the virus onto cell surface receptors. Even though, CD55 and Coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor protein (CAR) have been identified as receptors for Coxsackievirus B3, the exact mechanisms that Coxsackievirus B3 and B5 use to infect the cardiac muscle are not yet known. In this study, attempts were made to inhibit Coxsackievirus B3 and Coxsackievirus B5 infectivity of cardiac cells by using CAR and CD55 specific antibodies. The results show that these antibodies could not completely inhibit Coxsackievirus B3 and Coxsackievirus B5 binding or infectivity. Furthermore five new proteins have been identified that are used by Coxsackieviruses for binding to cardiac tissue and are distinct from CAR or CD55, leading us to believe that these viruses may use a different set of receptors for infection of cardiac muscle.", "journal": "Journal of medical virology", "date": "2004-08-28", "authors": ["GeorgeOrthopoulos", "KathyTriantafilou", "MarthaTriantafilou"], "doi": "10.1002/jmv.20184"}

{"title": "[H2S, a new neuromodulator].", "abstract": "The formation of H2S from cyst(e)ine is catalyzed by three enzymes, cystathionine beta synthase, cystathionase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In the liver, kidney, enterocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, H2S is principally synthesized by cystathionase. In contrast, it is synthesized by cystathionine beta synthase in the brain and partially by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in cardiac tissue. H2S is catabolized, essentially in mitochondria by thiosulfate reductase. The sulfite generated is then oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase. The amount of thiosulfate excreted in the urine is the best indicator of H2S biosynthesis, together with sulfhemoglobin determination in erythrocytes. H2S acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, increasing responses mediated by NMDA receptors, facilitating the induction of long-term potentialization in the hippocampus. H2S also acts as a vasodilator, acting directly on ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. The concentration of H2S is abnormally low in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease, due to changes in the concentration of the physiological activator of cystathionine beta synthase. The overproduction of H2S described in subjects with Down's syndrome probably results from the overproduction of cystathionine beta synthase, as the gene encoding this protein is located on chromosome 21.", "journal": "Medecine sciences : M/S", "date": "2004-08-27", "authors": ["PierreKamoun"], "doi": "10.1051/medsci/2004206-7697"}

In an effort to understand how these signaling pathways control the expression of key cardiac regulators, we have characterized the cis-regulatory elements of the chick tinman homolog chick Nkx2.5. We find that at least three distinct cardiac activating regions (CARs) of chick Nkx2.5 cooperate to regulate early expression in the cardiac crescent and later segmental expression in the developing heart. In this report, we focus our attention on a 3' BMP-responsive enhancer, termed CAR3, which directs robust cardiac transgene expression. By systematic mutagenesis and gel shift analysis of this enhancer, we demonstrate that GATA4/5/6, YY1 and SMAD1/4 are all necessary for BMP-mediated induction and heart-specific expression of CAR3. Adjacent YY1 and SMAD-binding sites within CAR3 constitute a minimal BMP response element, and interaction of SMAD1/4 with the N terminus of YY1 is required for BMP-mediated induction of CAR3. Our data suggest that BMP-mediated activation of this regulatory region reflects both the induction of GATA genes by BMP signals, as well as modulation of the transcriptional activity of YY1 by direct interaction of this transcription factor with BMP-activated SMADs.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2004-08-27", "authors": ["Kyu-HoLee", "SamuelEvans", "Todd YRuan", "Andrew BLassar"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.01344"}

To date, studies on the role of IFN-gamma in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease have focused on peripheral production of IFN-gamma, and have yielded conflicting results. Affected heart tissue is not available from children with Kawasaki disease. In this study, we use an animal model of Kawasaki disease, Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE)-induced coronary arteritis, to examine the role of IFN-gamma in the development of coronary artery lesions. We report the presence of IFN-gamma, both at the mRNA and protein levels, in the affected vessels. Its biphasic expression, first at days 3-7 and again at days 28-42 post-LCWE injection, corresponds to the first appearance of inflammatory infiltrate in coronary arteries, and later to vascular wall disruption and aneurysm formation, respectively. Interestingly, ablation of IFN-gamma expression did not dampen the inflammatory response, and IFN-gamma-deficient lymphocytes proliferated more vigorously in response to LCWE than those of wild-type animals. Of more importance, the incidence of coronary arteritis was the same in IFN-gamma-deficient and wild-type mice. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that IFN-gamma regulates the immune response during development of coronary arteritis, but is not required for the induction of coronary artery disease.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2004-08-24", "authors": ["Wesley CChan", "Trang TDuong", "Rae S MYeung"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.173.5.3492"}

As such, M40403 represents an important pharmacological tool to dissect the roles of O(2)(-) in functional and biochemical cardiovascular alterations induced by perfusion of high glucose concentrations into the heart. Perfusion of a high glucose concentration of glucose into the heart elicited important cardiovascular alterations characterized by QT interval prolongation, increase in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), lipid peroxidation, decrease in MnSOD activity and DNA damage. All parameters of cardiovascular alteration were attenuated by M40403 (1-10 mg/l). Furthermore, perfusion of a high of glucose concentration induced a significant formation of nitrotyrosine as well as an activation of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) synthetase (PARS), as determined by immunohistochemical analysis of heart tissue. The extent of staining for nitrotyrosine and PARS was reduced by M40403. These results clearly indicate that O(2)(-) plays a critical role in the development of the functional and biochemical cardiovascular alterations induced by perfusion of a high concentration of glucose into the heart.

{"title": "The opioid receptor independent actions of kappa receptor agonists in the cardiovascular system.", "abstract": "It is not well known but the actions of opioid receptor agonist and antagonist drugs have not been well characterized in the heart and cardiovascular system. Under normal physiological conditions, opioid receptors have a limited role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. Instead the primary focus of opioid receptor research, for many years, relates to the characterization of the actions as analgesics in the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, however a series of studies suggest that in particular the arylacetamide class of kappa (kappa) opioid receptor agonist drugs have significant opioid receptor independent actions on the heart and cardiovascular system. Some of the actions of these molecules may indeed be mediated by activation of peripheral opioid receptors; however, these new studies provide pharmacological evidence to the contrary and show using many different in vitro and in vivo animal models that these 'non-opioid' actions result from direct or opioid receptor-independent actions on cardiac tissue. This article will outline the molecular mechanism(s) that are responsible for the cardiovascular and cardiac actions these arylacetamide kappa opioid receptor agonists and characterize the role that these opioid receptors have in ischaemic arrhythmogenesis. In many instances it would appear that the effects of opioid agonists (and antagonists) in cardiovascular disease models of ischaemia may be mediated by opioid receptor-independent actions of these drugs.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2004-08-24", "authors": ["Michael KPugsley"], "doi": "10.2174/1381612043383917"}
{"title": "Calcium overload and cardiac function.", "abstract": "The changes in cardiac function caused by calcium overload are reviewed. Intracellular Ca(2+) may increase in different structures [e.g. sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), cytoplasm and mitochondria] to an excessive level which induces electrical and mechanical abnormalities in cardiac tissues. The electrical manifestations of Ca(2+) overload include arrhythmias caused by oscillatory (V(os)) and non-oscillatory (V(ex)) potentials. The mechanical manifestations include a decrease in force of contraction, contracture and aftercontractions. The underlying mechanisms involve a role of Na(+) in electrical abnormalities as a charge carrier in the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange and a role of Ca(2+) in mechanical toxicity. Ca(2+) overload may be induced by an increase in [Na(+)](i) through the inhibition of the Na(+)-K(+) pump (e.g. toxic concentrations of digitalis) or by an increase in Ca(2+) load (e.g. catecholamines). The Ca(2+) overload is enhanced by fast rates. Purkinje fibers are more susceptible to Ca(2+) overload than myocardial fibers, possibly because of their greater Na(+) load. If the SR is predominantly Ca(2+) overloaded, V(os) and fast discharge are induced through an oscillatory release of Ca(2+) in diastole from the SR; if the cytoplasm is Ca(2+) overloaded, the non-oscillatory V(ex) tail is induced at negative potentials. The decrease in contractile force by Ca(2+) overload appears to be associated with a decrease in high energy phosphates, since it is enhanced by metabolic inhibitors and reduced by metabolic substrates. The ionic currents I(os) and I(ex) underlie V(os) and V(ex), respectively, both being due to an electrogenic extrusion of Ca(2+) through the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange. I(os) is an oscillatory current due to an oscillatory release of Ca(2+) in early diastole from the Ca(2+)-overloaded SR, and I(ex) is a non-oscillatory current due to the extrusion of Ca(2+) from the Ca(2+)-overloaded cytoplasm. I(os) and I(ex) can be present singly or simultaneously. An increase in [Ca(2+)](i) appears to be involved in the short- and long-term compensatory mechanisms that tend to maintain cardiac output in physiological and pathological conditions. Eventually, [Ca(2+)](i) may increase to overload levels and contribute to cardiac failure. Experimental evidence suggests that clinical concentrations of digitalis increase force in Ca(2+)-overloaded cardiac cells by decreasing the inhibition of the Na(+)-K(+) pump by Ca(2+), thereby leading to a reduction in Ca(2+) overload and to an increase in force of contraction.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical science", "date": "2004-08-19", "authors": ["MarioVassalle", "Cheng-ILin"], "doi": "10.1007/BF02256119"}

PNIPAM-gelatin solution gels almost immediately when heated above 34 degrees C. We thought this property could become advantageous as scaffolding for reconstituting three-dimensional tissue. Because PNIPAM-gelatin solution gels so quickly, all seeded cells in PNIPAM-gelatin solution would become entrapped and uniformly distributed toward three dimensions. Thus it would be possible to reconstitute three-dimensional tissue by a very simple method of mixing cells and PNIPAM-gelatin solution. Fetal rat cardiac cells were mixed with PNIPAM-gelatin solution, incubated at 37 degrees C to allow the mixture to gel, and cultured in vitro.

The effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockade in attenuating unfavourable post-MI outcomes indicates an important role for angiotensin (Ang) II signalling in the post-MI remodelling process. 2. AT1 and AT2 receptor expression is known to be altered during the early postinjury period and at the later failure stage in the infarcted heart. The aim of the present investigation was to characterize AngII receptor expression shifts in the intermediate, adaptive phases of post-MI hypertrophic remodelling. 3. The present study investigated relative cardiac AT1 and AT2 receptor expression levels using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (GAPDH normalized) in rats at 4 and 20 weeks after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. 4. Heart weight and normalized heart weight were significantly higher in the MI group than in the sham group 4 weeks post-MI, with significant hypertrophy of the left ventricle, left atrium and right ventricle in MI rats. At 20 weeks post-MI, left ventricular hypertrophy remained significant, whereas the mass of the other cardiac tissues was not different to that of sham controls. 5. AT2 receptor expression was markedly reduced in both the non-infarct and infarcted areas of the left ventricular wall in the MI group compared with the sham-operated group 4 weeks after surgery. Expression levels were reduced to 8 and 13% of sham values in the viable and scar tissue regions, respectively. By 20 weeks post-MI, there was no evidence of AT2 receptor expression suppression in the left ventricle. No significant relative changes in AT1 receptor mRNA levels were observed at either 4 or 20 weeks post-MI. 6. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, a selective downregulation of left ventricular AT2 receptor expression in the intermediate phase of post-MI ventricular remodelling in the rat. This downregulation may provide an enhanced AT1 receptor-mediated compensatory progrowth signal in the early adaptive post-MI growth phase.

The full bidomain model for the propagation of electrical activation consists of coupled elliptic-parabolic partial differential equations for the transmembrane potential upsilon(m) and extracellular potential phi(e), together with quasistatic equations for the flow of current in the extracardiac regions. In this work we develop a preliminary assessment of the consequences of neglecting the effect of the passive extracardiac tissue and intracardiac blood masses on wave propagation in isolated whole heart models and describe a decoupling procedure, which requires no assumptions on the anisotropic conductivities and which yields a single reaction-diffusion equation for simulating the propagation of activation.

We have recently reported that acute treatment with anthracyclines inhibits membrane-associated calcium-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) activity both in vitro and in vivo. This study presents data that iPLA(2) activity is also suppressed during chronic drug administration. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were given weekly 1 mg/kg i.v. injections of doxorubicin for a total of 8 weeks. One week after the last injection, the animals were sacrificed, and heart tissue was assessed for phospholipid content and iPLA(2) activity. Membrane-associated iPLA(2) activity in the myocardium of doxorubicin-treated animals was 40% lower than that in control hearts. In addition, doxorubicin treatment resulted in significant alterations in the distribution of fatty acyl moieties esterified to the sn-2 position of choline glycerophospholipids. The ethanolamine species remained unaffected. Elevation in the amount of arachidonate and linoleate esterified to the sn-2 position of choline plasmalogens was consistent with the hypothesis that iPLA(2) displays selectivity for plasmalogen phospholipids; therefore, enzyme inhibition may affect hydrolysis of these phospholipid subclasses. Notably, the changes in phospholipid content occurred at a low cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg at which appearance of structural lesions was minimal. Therefore, these alterations seem to be both specific and early signs of cardiomyocyte pathology.

{"title": "Role of proteases in the pathophysiology of cardiac disease.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death and thus a great deal of effort has been made in salvaging the diseased myocardium. Although various factors have been identified as possible causes of different cardiac diseases such as heart failure and ischemic heart disease, there is a real need to elucidate their role for the better understanding of the cardiac disease pathology and formulation of strategies for developing newer therapeutic interventions. In view of the intimate involvement of different types of proteases in maintaining cellular structure, the role of proteases in various cardiac diseases has become the focus of recent research. Proteases are present in the cytosol as well as are localized in a number of subcellular organelles in the cell. These are known to use extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal, sarcolemmal, sarcoplasmic reticular, mitochondrial and myofibrillar proteins as substrates. Work from different laboratories using a wide variety of techniques has shown that the activation of proteases causes alterations of a number of specific proteins leading to subcellular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. Inhibition of protease action by different drugs and agents, therefore, has a clinical relevance and is expected to form a part of new treatment paradigm for improving heart function. This review examines the biochemistry and localization of some of the proteases in the cardiac tissue in addition to identification of the sites of action of some protease inhibitors.

Transgenic (Tg) eNOS-overexpressing mice (eNOS Tg) (n=22) and wild-type (WT) mice (n=24) were studied. Western blot analysis indicated greater than sixfold increase of eNOS in cardiac tissue. Echocardiography in awake mice indicated no difference in cardiac function between WT and eNOS Tg; however, systolic pressure in eNOS Tg mice decreased significantly (126 +/- 2.3 to 109 +/- 2.3 mmHg; P <0.05), whereas heart rate (HR) was not different. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was also decreased (9.8 +/- 0.8 to 7.6 +/- 0.4 4 mmHg.ml(-1).min; P <0.05) in eNOS Tg. Furthermore, female eNOS Tg mice showed even lower TPR (7.2 +/- 0.4 mmHg.ml(-1).min) compared with male eNOS mice (8.6 +/- 0.5, mmHg.ml.min(-1); P <0.05). Left ventricular slices were isolated from WT and eNOS Tg mice. With the use of a Clark-type oxygen electrode in an airtight bath, MVO2 was determined as the percent decrease during increasing doses (10(-10) to 10(-4) mol/l) of bradykinin (BK), carbachol (CCh), forskolin (10(-12) to 10(-6) mol/l), or S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP; 10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/l). Baseline MVO2 was not different between WT (181 +/- 13 nmol.g(-1).min(-1)) and eNOS Tg (188 +/- 14 nmol.g(-1).min(-1)). BK decreased MVO2 (10(-4) mol/l) in WT by 17% +/- 1.1 and 33% +/- 2.7 in eNOS Tg (P < 0.05). CCh also decreased MVO2, 10(-4) mol/l, in WT by 20% +/- 1.7 and 31% +/- 2.0 in eNOS Tg (P <0.05).

N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-3) mol/l) inhibited the MVO2 reduction to BK, CCh, and forskolin by a similar degree (P <0.05), but not to SNAP.

Positive inotropic responses were attenuated by verapamil, but unaffected by metoprolol, cimetidine, pyrilamine, tetrodotoxin and pinacidil. Microelectrode studies on isolated left ventricular papillary muscles demonstrated that the extract prolonged action potential duration at 20, 50 and 90% of repolarisation and delayed ventricular papillary muscle relaxation. Cardiovascular tissues isolated from rats with experimentally induced tick paralysis showed no myocardial damage as identified by histological and ultrastructural examination. The basal rate and force of contraction of isolated cardiac tissues were lower from tick-paralysed than normal rats. Concentration-response curves to dobutamine and calcium chloride were similar between tissues from tick-paralysed and normal rats.

{"title": "Developmental expression of rat torsinA transcript and protein.", "abstract": "A GAG deletion in the gene (TOR1A) for torsinA is associated with childhood-onset generalized dystonia (DYT1). Environmental factors may contribute to development of the phenotype since mutations in TOR1A are clinically penetrant in less than 40% of cases. Median age of onset is 10 and appearance of dystonia after 28 is rare. As a step towards understanding the temporal window of DYT1 disease penetrance, we have examined torsinA transcript and protein expression in rats from the embryonic period through adulthood. With relative quantitative multiplex real-time RT-PCR, we detected torsinA transcript in both neural (cerebellar cortex, striatum, cerebral cortex, thalamus and hippocampus) and non-neural (liver, kidney and heart) tissues at each developmental time point tested (embryonic day 20 [E20], postnatal day 1 [P1], P7, P14, P36, 6 months, 1.5 years). Levels of torsinA transcript were highest at E20 or P1 in all tissues examined except for the cerebellum where transcript levels peaked at P14. Early postnatal levels of torsinA transcript were over three times higher than those seen in adult rats. With quantitative radioactive in situ hybridization, torsinA transcript was widely distributed in brain at all ages with levels peaking at P14 in both cerebellum and striatum. TorsinA-immunoreactivity (IR) was present in neurons throughout the brain. TorsinA-IR was detected in perikarya, dendrites and axons but not nuclei. At P14, prominent expression of torsinA was noted in both striatal cholinergic interneurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Our results suggest that torsinA may contribute to postnatal maturational events in the brain such as dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, the time course of torsinA expression in discrete components of motor networks is compatible with the temporal window of clinical penetrance in DYT1 mutation carriers.", "journal": "Brain research.

In Experiment 1, adult quail were orally dosed with T-2 toxin to determine the lethal dose that resulted in 50% mortality of the affected population (LD50), and that dose was determined to be 14.7 mg of T-2 toxin per kilogram of body weight (BW). A second experiment was performed to study the effects of 12-18 mg/kg BW T-2 toxin on blood chemistry and liver enzyme profiles. Posttreatment uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, and gamma glutamyltransferase increased as compared with pretreatment values. In contrast, posttreatment plasma total protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels numerically decreased as compared with pretreatment values. Changes in blood chemistry values were consistent with liver and kidney damage after T-2 toxin exposure. In Experiment 3, histologic analyses of bone marrow, spleen, liver, small intestine, kidney, and heart were conducted on birds dosed in Experiment 2. Marked lymphocyte necrosis and depletion throughout the spleen, thymus, bursa, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue in the small intestine were observed in birds dosed with 15 and 18 mg/kg BW T-2 toxin. Necrosis of liver and lipid accumulation as a result of malfunctioning hepatocytes were also observed. Little or no morphologic change was observed in bone marrow and heart tissue.

We found that type IV, V, VI and VII adenylyl cyclases were all expressed in cardiomyocytes. Whereas types IV and VII RNA were more abundant in extra-cardiac than cardiac tissues, both absolute and relative expression of type VI was greatest in heart, and lower in tissues lacking a beta1-adrenoceptor. Type V expression was virtually confined to atrium. In situ mRNA hybridisation showed that the beta1-adrenoceptor co-localised with type VI adenylyl cyclase but not other subtypes in juxtoglomerular cells of human kidney.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed rapid infiltration of macrophages into infarcted tissue within 7 days in wild-type (WT) mice.

Echocardiography demonstrated beneficial effects of CCR2 deficiency on left ventricular remodeling at 7 and 28 days after MI. In situ zymography showed augmented gelatinolytic activity in WT mice within 7 days after MI, whereas gelatinolytic activity was barely detectable in CCR2(-/-) mice. Moreover, the distribution of gelatinolytic activity in serial sections was very similar to the distribution of macrophages rather than neutrophils.

In normal rat heart tissue, PLC-delta1 (about 44 ng/mg of heart tissue) was most abundant isozymes compared to PLC-gamma1 (6.8 ng/mg) and PLC-beta1 (0.4 ng/mg). In ischemic heart and hypoxic neonatal cardiomyocytes, PLC-delta1, but not PLC-beta1 and PLC-gamma1, was selectively degraded, a response that could be inhibited by the calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, and by the caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. Overexpression of the PLC-delta1 in hypoxic neonatal cardiomyocytes rescued intracellular Ca2+ overload by ischemic conditions. In the border zone and scar region of infarcted myocardium, and in hypoxic neonatal cardiomyocytes, the selective degradation of PLC-delta1 by the calcium sensitive proteases may play important roles in intracellular Ca2+ regulations under the ischemic conditions.

Disease severity was estimated by the macroscopic and microscopic findings for the heart, heart weight to body weight ratio, and cellular and humoral immune responses on day 21. Enhanced MIF protein and mRNA expression in the heart tissue and an elevated serum MIF concentration were confirmed in EAM. In experiment 1, the anti-MIF Ab treatment markedly inhibited the onset of EAM. Moreover, a significant reduction in disease severity was also achieved even after the delayed anti-MIF Ab treatment in experiment 2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MIF blockade decreased the expression of VCAM-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta and the migration of T-cells and macrophages in the EAM heart.

We used the whole-cell voltage clamp technique in pig and rat ventricular myocytes to characterize the permeation, blockage properties and regulation of the cardiac IMIC channels in order to compare them with TRP channels, in particular with Mg2+ -sensitive TRPM6 and TRPM7. We show that removing extracellular divalent cations unmasks large inward and outward monovalent currents, which can be inhibited by intracellular Mg2+. Inward currents are suppressed upon replacing extracellular Na+ by NMDG+. Divalent cations block monovalent IMIC and, at 10-20 mm, carry measurable currents. Their efficacy sequence in decreasing outward IMIC (Ni2+ = Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Ba2+) and in inducing inward IMIC (Ni2+ >> Mg2+ = Ca2+ approximately Ba2+), and their permeabilities calculated from reversal potentials are similar to those of TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels. The trivalent cations Gd3+ and Dy3+ also block IMIC in a voltage-dependent manner (delta = 0.4-0.5). In addition they inhibit the inward current carried by divalent cations. IMIC is regulated by pH. Decreasing or increasing extracellular pH decreased and increased IMIC, respectively (pH0.5 = 6.9, nH = 0.98). Qualitatively similar results were obtained on IMIC in rat basophilic leukaemia cells.

{"title": "Histopathology of ventricles, coronary arteries and mast cell accumulation in transverse and longitudinal sections of the rat heart after irradiation.", "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare cross sections with longitudinal sections in histopathological examination of the rat heart after irradiation, to find the most optimal method for the detection of cardiac radiation injuries. For this purpose, rats were irradiated locally on the heart with a single dose of 0 or 20 Gy. At different time points after irradiation, hearts were perfused and cut into longitudinal or cross sections. In both sections, several histopathological changes were scored on a graded scale between 0 and 3. Mast cells, which are thought to play a role in tissue remodelling, were counted. After 20 Gy, frequently occurring lesions were most severe in the upper half of the ventricles and the septum. These lesions could only be detected when using longitudinal sections, resulting in a higher total histopathological score than the examination of a single cross section. From 3 months onwards, changes in coronary arteries of irradiated hearts included endothelial cell loss, a loss of smooth muscle cells and fibrosis in media and adventitia. Up to 1 month after irradiation, mast cell densities of the left and right ventricles were decreased after 15 and 20 Gy, compared to time-matched controls, followed by increases from 3 months onwards. In the left ventricle, mast cell densities correlated with myocardial degeneration and fibre loss. The results of this study show that the usage of a single longitudinal section in the histopathological examination of the irradiated rat heart leads to the recognition of more severe injuries, including myocardial degeneration and fibrosis, in ventricular tissue than the usage of a single midventricular cross section. Morphological changes observed in coronary arteries of irradiated hearts might lead to a decreased compliance of the coronary artery wall. Further investigation is needed to determine the role of mast cells in cardiac tissue remodelling after irradiation.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2004-07-16", "authors": ["MBoerma", "CZurcher", "IEsveldt", "C ISchutte-Bart", "JWondergem"], "doi": "10.3892/or.12.2.213"}

In several families with X linked dilated cardiomyopathy, the pattern of expression of dystrophin mutations in cardiac muscle differs from that in skeletal muscle. A number of these mutations affect transcription and splicing of the dystrophin gene in a tissue specific manner; others may affect regions of dystrophin that are presumed to have a more important role in cardiac than in skeletal muscle. These mutations are important because they highlight the fundamental differences in processing of the dystrophin gene between skeletal and cardiac tissues, as well as differences in the functional domains more relevant for one tissue or the other.

In the present study, we generated a new model of cMyBP-C null mice and characterized the phenotype in both homozygotes and heterozygotes at different ages.\nThe mouse model was based upon the targeted deletion of exons 1 and 2, which contain the transcription initiation site, and the phenotype was determined by molecular, functional and morphological analyses.\nHerein, we demonstrate that inactivation of one or two mouse cMyBP-C alleles leads to different cardiac disorders at different post-natal time windows. The homozygous cMyBP-C null mice do not express the cMyBP-C gene, develop eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy with decreased fractional shortening at 3-4 months of age and a markedly impaired relaxation after 9 months. This is associated with myocardial disarray and an increase of interstitial fibrosis. The heterozygous cMyBP-C null mice present a slight but significant decrease of cMyBP-C amount and develop asymmetric septal hypertrophy associated with fibrosis at 10-11 months of age.\nThese data provide evidence that heterozygous cMyBP-C null mice represent the first model with a key feature of human FHC that is asymmetric septal hypertrophy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2004-07-14", "authors": ["LucieCarrier", "RalphKn\u00f6ll", "NicolasVignier", "Dagmar IKeller", "PedroBausero", "BernardPrudhon", "RichardIsnard", "Marie-LoryAmbroisine", "MarcFiszman", "JohnRoss", "KettySchwartz", "Kenneth RChien"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.009"}
{"title": "Transmural changes in size, contractile and electrical properties of SHR left ventricular myocytes during compensated hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Some hypertrophic stimuli provoke responses from myocytes that vary across the thickness of the left ventricular wall. The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) is a well-established genetic model of hypertension and whole heart hypertrophy. Details of transmural responses to hypertension in the SHR are few, but are needed if the properties of this model are to be fully understood. We therefore tested the hypothesis that left ventricular myocytes of the SHR do not respond uniformly to their hypertensive environment.\nThe volume, contraction and action potentials of enzymically isolated sub-epicardial (EPI) mid-myocardial (MID) and sub-endocardial (ENDO) myocytes from the left ventricle of 20-week-old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats were compared.\nCompared to WKY, as a single population, SHR myocytes displayed concentric hypertrophy (larger volumes with smaller length:width) increased t-tubule spacing, larger and prolonged cell shortening and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) transients and longer action potentials. However, these responses differed across the left ventricular wall. MID myocytes showed significantly less hypertrophy than EPI and ENDO myocytes. EPI myocytes showed the largest (and significant) increases in cell shortening, [Ca2+]i transients and action potential duration, whilst MID myocytes showed the smallest (and non-significant) changes in these parameters. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis on cardiac tissue suggest that increased expression of mRNA for fibronectin-1 and protein kinase Cepsilon are involved in the hypertrophic response of the whole heart.\nOur findings show that in the SHR, the effect of hypertension upon the morphology, mechanical activity and electrical activity of left ventricular myocytes is dependent upon their transmural location. Therefore, in addition to the overall compensating response to hypertension, i.e. increased contractility, there are likely to be regionally specific alterations in mechano-electric interactions that may influence the properties of this important model, e.g. its pre-disposition to arrhythmia whilst still in a compensated state.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2004-07-14", "authors": ["Zoe AnneMcCrossan", "RudolfBilleter", "EdWhite"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.013"}

Measures of calsequestrin (CSQ), however, a critical protein component of the Ca2+ release complex in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, have provided little or no evidence of underlying dysfunction. We previously reported that calsequestrin isolated from heart tissue exists in a variety of glycoforms and phosphoforms reflecting mannose trimming of N-linked glycans and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on protein kinase CK2-sensitive sites.\nHere, we tested whether the distribution of molecular forms changes in heart failure (HF) reflecting possible remodeling of diseased tissue. Canine hearts were paced (220 beats/min) for 6-8 weeks to induce heart failure. Calsequestrin was purified from heart failure and sham-operated (control) treated canine ventricles and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry.\nThe results showed striking changes in the mass distribution of calsequestrin molecules present in tissue from heart failure (five animals) compared with control (five animals). In heart failure, calsequestrin contained glycan structures that were uncharacteristic of normal junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, consistent with altered metabolism or altered trafficking through secretory compartments. Glycoforms containing Man8,9, expected for a phenotype less muscle-like, were more than doubled in heart failure hearts, and molecules were also phosphorylated to a higher level.\nThese data reveal in tachycardia-induced heart failure a new and potentially important change in the mannose content of calsequestrin glycans, perhaps indicative of defective junctional SR trafficking and Ca2+ release complex assembly.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2004-07-14", "authors": ["ArashKiarash", "Carmen EKelly", "Brett SPhinney", "H\u00e9ctor HValdivia", "JudithAbrams", "Steven ECala"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.001"}

P-gp was detected in the endothelial wall. Quantitative immunohistochemistry of protein expression, however, did not reveal significant influence of the studied SNPs.\nThe present study based on auricular samples suggests that genetic factors play a rather limited role in modulating P-gp expression in human heart.

In clinical practice, there is a need for senescence-specific therapies to protect against stress and for biochemical markers of senescence to identify those patients most in need of therapy. In isolated rat hearts, in human tissues, and in a clinical trial, we have shown previously that coenzyme Q(10) has the ability to protect the heart against stress especially in senescence. We recently have devised a regimen of therapy to protect the senescent heart against stress, combining metabolic therapy (coenzyme Q(10), alpha lipoic acid, magnesium orotate, and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) with physical exercise and mental stress reduction. The preliminary results of this program are promising. In an endeavor to predict the likely response of individual senescent hearts to stress, we correlated the tissue load of mitochondrial DNA deletions and total cellular mitochondrial DNA copy number in human cardiac tissue with recovery of the same tissue from ischemia/reperfusion stress. We found that these mitochondrial markers actually were less predictive of impaired response to stress than age alone. We conclude that the aging heart has a diminished capacity to recover from stress that is not readily predictable by cardiac content of intact mitochondrial DNA and that this recovery can be improved by metabolic therapy combined with physical exercise and mental stress reduction.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2004-07-13", "authors": ["FranklinRosenfeldt", "FrancisMiller", "PhillipNagley", "AnthonyHadj", "SilvanaMarasco", "DeahneQuick", "FreyaSheeran", "MichelleWowk", "SalvatorePepe"], "doi": "10.1196/annals.1297.016"}

In this study we determined reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in skeletal muscle and heart of young and aged rats. We also calculated GSH/GSSG molar ratio and glutathione redox system. GSH levels were significantly lowered in aged rats than young rats. Conversely, GSSG levels were significantly high in aged rats. GSH/GSSG molar ratio and redox index were found to decreased in aged rats. The activities of GPx, GR, and G6PDH were found to be decreased in aged rats when compared with young rats. Supplementation of carnitine and lipoic acid to aged rats significantly increased the GSH levels thereby increasing the activity of GPx, GR, and G6PDH in skeletal muscle and heart of aged rats.

One proposed survival mechanism is the closing of ion channels to decrease energetic cost of ion pumping (Hochachka PW. Science 231: 234-241, 1986). To test this hypothesis, the involvement of L-type Ca2+ channels in seasonal anoxia tolerance of the vertebrate heart was examined by determining the number of [methyl-3H]PN200-110 (a ligand of L-type Ca2+ channel alpha-subunit) binding sites of the cardiac tissue and the density of Ca2+ current in ventricular myocytes of an anoxia-resistant fish species, the crucian carp. In their natural environment, the fish were exposed for > 3 mo of hypoxia (O2 < 2.5 mg/l) followed by almost 8 wk of anoxia that resulted in abrupt depletion of cardiac glycogen stores in late spring. Unexpectedly, however, the number of [methyl-3H]PN200-110 binding sites did not decline in hypoxia/anoxia as predicted by the channel arrest hypothesis but remained constant for most of the year. However, in early summer, the number of [methyl-3H]PN200-110 binding sites doubled for a period of approximately 2 mo, which functionally appeared as a 74% larger Ca2+ current density. Thus the anoxia tolerance of the carp heart cannot be based on downregulation of Ca2+ channel units in myocytes but is likely to depend on suppressed heart rate, i.e., regulation of the heart at the systemic level, and direct depressive effects of low temperature on Ca2+ current to achieve savings in cardiac work load and ion pumping.

Analysis was performed on three groups of mice: 4-week-old CuD mice that exhibited signs of cardiac failure, their age-matched copper-adequate (CuA) controls, and the CuD mice that were re-fed adequate Cu for 2 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from hearts and subjected to cDNA micro-array and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis.

The mRNA levels of ET-1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and procollagen-I-alpha1 and III-alpha1 were increased in the CuD cardiac tissue. Copper repletion resulted in cardiac mRNA levels of most of the genes examined returning to control levels, although the K-dependent NCX and MMP-2 values did not reach those of the CuA control. In addition, CuR caused an increase in beta-MHC, L-type Ca(2+)channel, MMP-13 to levels surpassing those of CuA control, and a decrease in ET-1, and TNF-alpha mRNA levels. In summary, changes in gene expression of elements involved in contractility, Ca(2+) cycling, and inflammation and fibrosis may account for the altered cardiac function found in CuD mice.

One hundred ninety-eight (60.4%) of 328 patients experienced minor and major complications, and 11 of 328 patients died, for an overall mortality rate of 3.4%. Complications included the following: atrial fibrillation (145 [44.2%]), prolonged intubation (26 [7.9%]), vocal cord paralysis (22 [6.7%]), deep vein thrombosis (21 [6.4%]), technical complications (patch dehiscence, hemorrhage, or both; 20 [6.1%]), tamponade (12 [3.6%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [3.6%]), cardiac arrest (10 [3%]), constrictive physiology (9 [2.7%]), aspiration (9 [2.7%]), renal failure (9 [2.7%]), empyema (8 [2.4%]), tracheostomy (6 [1.8%]), myocardial infarction (5 [1.5%]), pulmonary embolus (5 [1.5%]), and bronchopleural fistula (2 [0.6%]). Clinical data demonstrated the following: (1) prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation is recommended; (2) early ambulation, aspiration precautions, endoscopic assessment of the vocal cords, and avoidance of fluid overload are crucial; (3) perioperative diagnosis and aggressive management of deep vein thrombosis are important; (4) immediate reoperation and open cardiac massage are essential for relief of cardiac herniation and tamponade from cardiac patch dysfunction; (5) diaphragmatic patch dehiscence, hemorrhage, or both require immediate reoperation; (6) early signs of infection might indicate bronchopleural fistula or empyema and should be treated with thoracoscopic or open drainage and staged removal of patch material; and (7) excessive perioperative mediastinal shift is treated with a catheter placed intraoperatively.\nComplications after extrapleural pneumonectomy require a unique approach to management, and mortality can be minimized by early detection and aggressive treatment.", "journal": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "date": "2004-06-30", "authors": ["David JSugarbaker", "Michael TJaklitsch", "RaphaelBueno", "WilliamRichards", "JeanneLukanich", "Steven JMentzer", "YolondaColson", "PhillipLinden", "MichaelChang", "LeahCapalbo", "ElizabethOldread", "SiyamekNeragi-Miandoab", "Scott JSwanson", "Lambros SZellos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.02.021"}

Mutations in the human TBX5 gene cause Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS), a disorder characterized by heart and upper limb deformities.

Direct sequencing detected nine mutations in diseased cardiac tissues of patients, eight of which are novel. Six mutations would affect amino acids in the T-domain, and one (c.236C>T, p.Ala79Val) is within the recently identified nuclear localization signal (NLS1) region. Further, mutations were found in patients with ASD and AVSD, but not with VSD; and mutations were absent in normal heart tissue of same patients, thus indicating somatic origin.

A total of 48 hamsters were fed a) hypercholesterolemic (HC) control, b) HC MCTo, c) HC ALP, or d) HC MCTo/ALP diet for 4 weeks. No differences were observed on food intake, body weight, total body water, lean and fat mass, and tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). ALP alone had no effect on total cholesterol (TC); however, MCTo feeding increased TC with (P < 0.03) and without (P < 0.003) ALP when compared with control. ALP increased HDL levels compared with control (P < 0.04) and MCTo/ALP (P < 0.007) groups. MCTo, with (P < 0.0001) or without (P < 0.006) ALP, increased non-HDL cholesterol levels versus control. The non-HDL:HDL cholesterol ratio was decreased by ALP compared with MCTo (45%) and MCTo/ALP (68%) (P < 0.0001), a similar trend was seen when compared with the HC control (22%) group (P < 0.14). Triglyceride levels were not altered by any dietary treatment. Liver and heart tissue reduced glutathione (GSH) was increased (P < 0.05) by all three treatments when compared with control.

{"title": "Cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5 is regulated by Nedd4-2 mediated ubiquitination.", "abstract": "Na(v)1.5, the cardiac isoform of the voltage-gated Na+ channel, is critical to heart excitability and conduction. However, the mechanisms regulating its expression at the cell membrane are poorly understood. The Na(v)1.5 C-terminus contains a PY-motif (xPPxY) that is known to act as binding site for Nedd4/Nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligases. Because Nedd4-2 is well expressed in the heart, we investigated its role in the ubiquitination and regulation of Na(v)1.5. Yeast two-hybrid and GST-pulldown experiments revealed an interaction between Na(v)1.5 C-terminus and Nedd4-2, which was abrogated by mutating the essential tyrosine of the PY-motif. Ubiquitination of Na(v)1.5 was detected in both transfected HEK cells and heart extracts. Furthermore, Nedd4-2-dependent ubiquitination of Na(v)1.5 was observed. To test for a functional role of Nedd4-2, patch-clamp experiments were performed on HEK cells expressing wild-type and mutant forms of both Na(v)1.5 and Nedd4-2. Na(v)1.5 current density was decreased by 65% upon Nedd4-2 cotransfection, whereas the PY-motif mutant channels were not affected. In contrast, a catalytically inactive Nedd4-2 had no effect, indicating that ubiquitination mediates this downregulation. However, Nedd4-2 did not alter the whole-cell or the single channel biophysical properties of Na(v)1.5. Consistent with the functional findings, localization at the cell periphery of Na(v)1.5-YFP fusion proteins was reduced upon Nedd4-2 coexpression. The Nedd4-1 isoform did not regulate Na(v)1.5, suggesting that Nedd4-2 is a specific regulator of Na(v)1.5. These results demonstrate that Na(v)1.5 can be ubiquitinated in heart tissues and that the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 acts on Na(v)1.5 by decreasing the channel density at the cell surface.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2004-06-26", "authors": ["Miguel Xvan Bemmelen", "Jean-S\u00e9bastienRougier", "BrunoGavillet", "FlorineApoth\u00e9loz", "Doroth\u00e9eDaidi\u00e9", "MichihiroTateyama", "IlariaRivolta", "Marc AThomas", "Robert SKass", "OlivierStaub", "HuguesAbriel"], "doi": "10.1161/01.RES.0000136816.05109.89"}
{"title": "Opening of Ca2+-activated K+ channels triggers early and delayed preconditioning against I/R injury independent of NOS in mice.", "abstract": "Opening of Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels has been shown to confer early cardioprotection. It is unknown whether the opening of these channels also induces delayed cardioprotection. In addition, we determined the involvement of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), which have been implicated in cardioprotection induced by opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. Adult male ICR mice were pretreated with the KCa-channel opener NS-1619 either 10 min or 24 h before 30 min of global ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion (I/R) in Langendorff mode. Infusion of NS-1619 (10 microM) for 10 min before I/R led to smaller infarct sizes as compared with the vehicle (DMSO)-treated group (P <0.05). This infarct-limiting effect of NS-1619 was associated with improvement in ventricular functional recovery after I/R. The NS-1619-induced protection was abolished by coadministration with the KCa-channel blocker paxilline (1 microM). Similarly, pretreatment with NS-1619 (1 mg/kg ip) induced delayed protection 24 h later (P <0.05). Interestingly, the NS-1619-induced late protection was not blocked by the NOS inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (15 mg/kg ip). Unlike diazoxide (the opener of mitochondrial KATP channels), NS-1619 did not increase the expression of inducible or endothelial NOS. Western blot analysis demonstrated the existence of alpha- and beta-subunits of KCa channels in mouse heart tissue. We conclude that opening of KCa channels leads to both early and delayed preconditioning effects through a mechanism that is independent of nitric oxide.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The effects of this type of shock are not yet fully understood. Animal experiments showed the superiority of biphasic shocks over monophasic ones in defibrillation. A mathematical computer simulation can increase the knowledge of human heart behavior.\nThe research presented in this article was done with different models representing a three-dimensional wedge of ventricular myocardium. The electrophysiology was described with Priebe-Beuckelmann model. The realistic fiber twist, which is specific to human myocardium was included. Planar electrodes were placed at the ends of the longest side of the virtual cardiac wedge, in a bath medium. They were sources of electrical shocks, which varied in magnitude from 0.1 to 5 V. In a second arrangement ring electrodes were placed directly on myocardium for getting a better view on secondary electrical sources. The electrical reaction of the tissue was generated with a bidomain model.\nThe reaction of the tissue to the electrical shock was specific to the initial imposed characteristics. Depolarization appeared in the first 5 ms in different locations. A further study of the cardiac tissue behavior revealed, which features influence the response of the considered muscle. It was shown that the time needed by the tissue to be totally depolarized is much shorter when a biphasic shock is applied. Each simulation ended only after complete repolarization was achieved. This created the possibility of gathering information from all states corresponding to one cycle of the cardiac rhythm.\nThe differences between the reaction of the homogeneous tissue and a tissue, which contains cleavage planes, reveals important aspects of superiority of biphasic pulses.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2004-06-24", "authors": ["Lulia MPopp", "GunnarSeemann", "OlafD\u00f6ssel"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2261-4-9\n10.1016/S0300-9572(03)00183-7\n10.1114/1.1312188\n10.1007/s003990050055\n10.1161/01.RES.0000031957.70034.89\n10.1109/10.284925"}

Our results show that endogenously produced IFN-gamma is essential to induce optimal expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on the cardiac vascular endothelium of infected mice. Furthermore, the influx of inflammatory cells into the cardiac tissue was impaired in Th1 cytokine-deficient infected mice, paralleling the intensity of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression on the vascular endothelium. Consistent with the importance of ICAM-1 in host resistance, ICAM-1 knockout (KO) mice were highly susceptible to T. cruzi infection, as assessed by mortality rate, parasitemia, and heart tissue parasitism. The enhanced parasitism was associated with a decrease in the numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the heart tissue of ICAM-1 KO mice. Additionally, ICAM-1 KO mice mounted an unimpaired IFN-gamma response and IFN-gamma-dependent production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and parasite- specific IgG2a. Supporting the participation of ICAM-1 in cell migration during T. cruzi infection, the entrance of adoptively transferred PBL from T. cruzi-infected wild-type C57BL/6 mice into the cardiac tissue of ICAM-1 KO mice was significantly abrogated. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that ICAM-1 plays a crucial role in T lymphocyte recruitment to the cardiac tissue and host susceptibility during T. cruzi infection.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2004-06-24", "authors": ["VladimirMichailowsky", "Mara R NCeles", "Ana PMarino", "Andr\u00e9a ASilva", "Leda QVieira", "Marcos ARossi", "Ricardo TGazzinelli", "JoseliLannes-Vieira", "Jo\u00e3o SSilva"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.173.1.463"}

Hence, frogs are an ideal model in which to explore the role of diffusion of NO from the endocardial endothelium (EE) without vascular endothelial or cardiac cell NO production. In Xenopus hearts we examined the regulation of cardiac O(2) consumption in vitro at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The NO-mediated control of O(2) consumption by bradykinin or carbachol was significantly (P < 0.05) lower at 25 degrees C (79 +/- 13 or 73 +/- 11 nmol/min) than at 37 degrees C (159 +/- 26 or 201 +/- 13 nmol/min). The response to the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine was also markedly lower at 25 degrees C (90 +/- 8 nmol/min) compared with 37 degrees C (218 +/- 15 nmol/min). When Triton X-100 was perfused into hearts, the inhibition of myocardial O(2) consumption by bradykinin (18 +/- 2 nmol/min) or carbachol (29 +/- 4 nmol/min) was abolished. Hematoxylin and eosin slides of Triton X-100-perfused heart tissue confirmed the absence of the EE. Although endothelial NO synthase protein levels were decreased to a variable degree in the Triton X-100-perfused heart, NO(2) production (indicating eNOS activity) decreased by >80%. It appears that the EE of the frog heart is the sole source of NO to regulate myocyte O(2) consumption. When these cells are removed, the ability of NO to regulate O(2) consumption is severely limited. Thus our results suggest that the EE produces enough NO, which diffuses from the EE to cardiac myocytes, to regulate myocardial O(2) consumption. Because of the close proximity of the EE to underlying myocytes, NO can diffuse over a distance and act as a messenger between the EE and the rest of the heart to control mitochondrial function and O(2) consumption.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that both corin and ANP mRNA levels were significantly increased in phenylephrine (PE)-stimulated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in culture.

{"title": "Ebselen decreases oxygen free radical production and iron concentrations in the hearts of chronically iron-overloaded mice.", "abstract": "Chronic iron overload is a major cause of cardiac failure throughout the world, but its pathogenesis remains to be clarified. It is conjectured that the toxicity of iron is due to its ability to catalyze the formation of oxygen free radicals (OFR), which can damage cellular membranes, proteins, and DNA. The authors report on the cardioprotective effects of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic ebselen on iron concentrations in the heart and GPx activity, and on the production of the cytotoxic aldehydes hexanal, 4-hydroxyl-2-nonenal (HNE), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Fifteen B6D2F1 mice were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups for a total of 20 treatments: 1) control (0.1 mL normal saline i.p. per mouse, per day); 2) iron-only (10 mg iron dextran i.p. per mouse, per day); 3) iron plus ebselen (25 mg/kg p.o. per mouse, per day). In comparison to iron-only treated mice, the authors' findings show that supplementation with ebselen can decrease both cytotoxic aldehyde and iron concentrations in heart tissue. Additionally, mice supplemented with ebselen had an increase in GPx activity level in comparison to iron-only treated mice. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the cardioprotective effects of ebselen against OFR damage in a model of chronic iron overload. These findings suggest that ebselen may have significance in the management of disorders of iron overload.", "journal": "Biological research for nursing", "date": "2004-06-10", "authors": ["Matthew TDavis", "Wally JBartfay"], "doi": "10.1177/1099800403261350"}

We here describe a case of a cardiac non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which the following, previously undescribed features manifest simultaneously. It occurred in a polytransfused hepatitis C virus-positive splenectomized thalassemic patient; it rapidly grew, giving rise to an enormous right atrial mass and, this notwithstanding, it was completely asymptomatic. This cardiac lymphoma was discovered during staging for a CD20+ large B-cell lymphoma of the tonsils. In particular, transesophageal echocardiography, showing that this prolapsing mass had a wide base on the atrial wall, led us to strongly suspect the lymphomatous origin of the mass itself. Notwithstanding anti-CD20 antibody therapy, urgent surgery was unavoidable and histology revealed that the mass consisted of lymphoma proliferation infiltrating even the right atrial wall and the pericardium. During the postoperative course the patient presented with a massive, fatal hemopericardium consequent to intravascular disseminated coagulation. This very unusual case, occurring in a hepatitis C virus-positive thalassemic patient, suggests that a case control study on the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in such patients may be interesting.", "journal": "Italian heart journal : official journal of the Italian Federation of Cardiology", "date": "2004-06-10", "authors": ["AlessandroRicchi", "AntonioCarta", "Gian MarcoPinna", "Emiliano MCirio", "MarcoFoddanu", "Pier FrancoTerrosu", "SimonettaPardini", "ClaudioFozza", "MaurizioLonginotti"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Intrapericardial delivery enhances cardiac effects of sotalol and atenolol.", "abstract": "Targeting drugs to the heart by intrapericardial (i.p.c.) delivery may be a promising strategy to obtain higher drug efficiencies with lesser side effects. We examined whether i.p.c. delivery of sotalol and atenolol in rats offers advantages over intravenous (i.v.) application. Following sustained IPC infusion of sotalol or atenolol, pericardial fluid levels exceeded plasma levels 97 and 134 times respectively (P < 0.01) resulting in 3.8 and 4.7 times higher overall left ventricular tissue drug levels (P < 0.05). In a second experiment, the effects of the i.p.c. or i.v. beta-blocker infusions on nitroprusside-induced tachycardia were studied in conscious rats. For both drugs, i.p.c. infusion of 0.03 mg/kg.h produced similar antitachycardiac effects as the 1 mg/kg.h i.v. dose. In a third set of studies, dP/dt max challenged by dobutamine infusion was assessed to study ventricular contractile function after i.v. and i.p.c. sotalol in anesthetized rats. i.p.c. sotalol infusion attenuated the dobutamine response curve to a greater extent than i.v. (P < 0.01). In conclusion, i.p.c. infusion of sotalol and atenolol results in high cardiac tissue concentrations with low systemic drug levels. Similar antitachycardiac effects can be obtained at a 10- to 30-fold lower dose compared with i.v. delivery. Also, depression of ventricular contractility is acquired at a substantially lower i.p.c. sotalol dose.

{"title": "[Aging-related increase of sensitivity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore to inductors in the rat heart].", "abstract": "An age-related increase in the sensitivity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to inductors of it's opening, Ca2+ ions and phenylarsineoxide (PAO) was studied in experiments in vitro on isolated heart mitochondria of adult and old rats. Two indices were measured spectrophotometrically (lambda = 520 nm) by a decrease in an optical density (OD), resulting from mitochondrial swelling and a release of mitochondrial unidentified substances (mitochondrial factor, MF) registered also spectrophotometrically in a range of waves lambda = 230-260 nm. Dose-dependent effect of Ca2+ (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l) and PAO (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/l) on swelling of the mitochondria were observed in samples from both adult and old rats. Swelling of the mitochondria from the heart of old rats induced by application of the above inductors was more intensive than the respective effect in samples from adult rats. In samples from the heart of both adult and old rats Ca2+ ions within the tested concentration range (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l) evoked the release of MF in a dose-dependent manner. Mitochondria from the heart of old rats were found to be capable of releasing some amounts of MF in the absence of the MPTP inductors PAO. When this inductor was applied in a 10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/l concentration range, isolated mitochondria from the heart of old rats released unidentified substances with the absorption peaks at two wavelength, lambda = 230 nm and lambda = 240-245 nm. The former peak was found to be Cyclosporin A-insensitive, while the latter peak could be practically completely inhibited by this antibiotic. The concentrations of tested solutions (10(-7) mol/l CaCl2 and 10(-9) mol/l PAO), at which the release of the factor from the mitochondria of the old rat heart was observed, were significantly lower than those in adult rats. Our experimental data show that mitochondria isolated from the heart tissue of old rats demonstrate significantly higher sensitivity to inductors of MPTP-opening, Ca(2+)-overload and PAO as compared to that typical of adult animals. A higher sensitivity of MPTP-opening in the heart of old rats was accompanied by a higher basal level of expression of mRNA of the bax gene, as compared to that found in adult animals. The expression of the bcl-2 gene showed no age group-related differences. It can be supposed that a proapoptotic agent, the Bax protein, is related to an increase in the sensitivity of the MPTP (in particular to that manifested in the processes of pore formation) in the course of aging. Antioxidants, melathonin and trolox, when applied in 10(-5) mol/l concentration, presented to a certain extent opening of the MPTP-induced by 10(-5) mol/l PAO in samples from adult and old rats. These findings can be used for correction of increased sensitivity of the MPTP to different inductors, which is typical of old rats. We conclude that physiological aging is accompanied by the mitochondrial dysfunction. The MF-released capability of the mitochondria from heart tissue of old rats observed both in the presence and absence of MPTP-opening inductors (probably related to a higher sensitivity of MPTP-opening) is one of the manifestation of such dysfunction.", "journal": "Fiziolohichnyi zhurnal (Kiev, Ukraine : 1994)", "date": "2004-06-04", "authors": ["V FSahach", "H LVavilova", "N AStrutyns'ka", "O VRudyk"], "doi": null}

For tissue characterization ECG gated Fast Spinecho (FSE) T (1)- (Double IR), T (1)-STIR (Triple IR) and T (2)-weighted sequences in transverse orientation were used. For functional analysis a steady state free precession (SSFP - FIESTA) sequence was performed in the 4-chamber, 2-chamber long axis and short axis view. The flip angle used for the SSFP sequence at 3.0 T was reduced from 45 degrees to 30 degrees to keep short TR times while staying within the pre-defined SAR limitations. All other sequence parameters were kept constant.\nAll acquisitions could successfully be completed for the 10 volunteers. The mean SNR 3.0 T compared to 1.5 T was remarkably increased (p < 0.05) for the T (2) - (160 % SNR increase), the STIR-T (1)- (123 %) and the T (1)- (91 %) weighted FSE. Similar results were found comparing CNR at 3.0 T and 1.5 T. The mean SNR achieved using the SSFP sequences was more than doubled by 3.0 T (150 %), but did not have any significant effect on the CNR. The image quality at 3.0 T did not appear to be improved, and was considered to be significantly worse when using SSFP sequences. Artefacts like shading in the area of the right ventricle (RV) were found to be more present at 3.0 T using FSE sequences. After a localized shim had been performed in 5/10 volunteers at the infero-lateral wall of the left ventricle (LV) with the SSFP sequences at 3.0 T no significant increase in artefacts could be detected.\nIn all cardiac FSE sequences, SNR and CNR at 3.0 T were found to be increased compared to 1.5 T without any major changes of the sequence parameters. The adjusted SSFP sequences fulfilled the expected increase in SNR at 3.0 T but showed no increase in CNR. On the contrary, the overall image quality did not change or was even found to be significantly lower for the SSFP and the FSE sequences at the free wall of the RV.

At 21 weeks following gene transduction, the lenti-AT2R-treated SHRs exhibited decreased left ventricular wall thickness compared with control animals. In contrast, basal BP did not differ between the two SHR groups. Finally, heart weight to body weight ratios indicated a significant decrease in lenti-AT2R-treated SHRs compared with SHR controls.

Therefore, we investigated the localization of CML in diabetic hearts. To investigate the presence and accumulation of CML in tissues, a monoclonal anti-CML antibody was generated and characterised. With this novel monoclonal antibody against CML, the localization of CML was investigated by immunohistochemistry, in heart tissue of controls (n = 9) and heart tissue of diabetic patients (n = 8) without signs of inflammation or infarction. In addition, in the same subjects we studied the presence of CML in renal and lung tissues. CML staining was approximately sixfold higher in hearts from diabetic patients as compared to control hearts (2.0 +/- 0.3 and 0.3 +/- 0.2 A.U., respectively, P < 0.01).

These neurons also regulate local tissue homeostasis, inflammation, healing and development, especially under conditions of psychological stress. Stress contributes to increased cancer recurrence and metastasis through as yet undefined mechanisms. Likewise, activity of capsaicin-sensitive neurons is altered by pathological conditions that may lead to metastatic growth (e.g. stress). Therefore, we examined effects of a treatment that induces sensory nerve denervation on breast cancer metastases. Systemic denervation of sensory neurons caused by treatment with 125 mg/kg capsaicin resulted in significantly more lung and cardiac metastases in adult mice injected orthotopically with syngeneic 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells than was observed in vehicle-treated controls. Heart metastases, normally very rare, occurred as pericardial nodules, intra-myocardial nodules, or combined pericardial-myocardial lesions.

Here, we measured shock-induced DeltaCa(i)2+ and DeltaV(m) in geometrically defined myocyte cultures. Cell strands (width=0.8 mm) were double-stained with Vm-sensitive dye RH-237 and a low-affinity Ca(i)2+-sensitive dye Fluo-4FF. Shocks (E approximately 5 to 40 V/cm) were applied during the action potential plateau. Shocks caused transient Ca(i)2+ decrease at sites of both negative and positive DeltaV(m). Similar Ca(i)2+ changes were observed in an ionic model of adult rat myocytes. Simulations showed that the Ca(i)2+ decrease at sites of DeltaV+m was caused by the outward flow of I(CaL) and troponin binding; at sites of DeltaV-m it was caused by inactivation of I(CaL) combined with extrusion by Na-Ca exchanger and troponin binding. The important role of I(CaL) was supported by experiments in which application of nifedipine eliminated Ca(i)2+ decrease at DeltaV+m sites. Largest DeltaCa(i)2+ were observed during shocks of approximately 10 V/cm causing simple monophasic DeltaV(m). Shocks stronger than approximately 20 V/cm caused smaller DeltaCa(i)2+ and postshock elevation of diastolic Ca(i)2+. This was paralleled with occurrence of biphasic negative DeltaVm that indicated membrane electroporation. Thus, these data indicate that shocks transiently decrease Ca(i)2+ at sites of both DeltaV-m and DeltaV+m. Outward flow of I(CaL) plays an important role in Ca(i)2+ decrease in the DeltaV+m areas. Very strong shocks caused smaller negative DeltaCa(i)2+ and postshock elevation of diastolic Ca(i)2+, likely caused by membrane electroporation.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2004-05-25", "authors": ["Vladimir GFast", "Eric RCheek", "Andrew EPollard", "Raymond EIdeker"], "doi": "10.1161/01.RES.0000132746.94360.8b"}

Delivery of peptides into cells is facilitated by conjugation to carrier peptides, such as Tat. When peptides are irreversibly conjugated to Tat, Tat-mediated subcellular localization may predominate, resulting in mislocalization of the peptide cargo. We have used intracellularly acting peptides, conjugated to Tat by a disulfide bond, to modulate protein kinase C (PKC) signaling; these PKC-modulating peptides are released from Tat upon intracellular delivery. Previously, the distribution of these peptides within tissue and throughout the body had not been demonstrated. We show here intravascular delivery of a PKC-peptide, reversibly conjugated to Tat, resulted in distribution throughout cardiac tissue. In addition, a single injection resulted in selective modulation of PKC activity in many organs.

Thirty male SHR were randomly divided into three groups: SHR-IR (treated with irbesartan, 50 mg/kg), SHR-IM (imidapril, 3 mg/kg), SHR-C (placebo). Ten male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) treated with placebo acted as the control. All treatments were administered once daily from 14 to 27 weeks of age. Imidapril and irbesartan have the similar inhibitor effects on blood pressure and left ventricular mass indexes in SHR. Despite both drugs suppressed ERK-1 protein expression, decreased cardiomyocytes apoptosis index, blocked collagen type I deposition, reduced TGF-beta(1) gene expression in SHR, imidapril elicits a stronger inhibitory effect. Irbesartan had little effect on MKP-1 protein expression, but imidapril decreased it significantly. As a result, the ERK-1/MKP-1 ratio in SHR-IR was significantly greater than that in SHR-IM (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the balance between MKP-1 and ERKs in myocardial tissue is important for cardiac cell proliferation and growth. They also indicate that the similar efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in reducing blood pressure does not predict the similar capacity to control the individual facet of left ventricular remodeling.

Hyaluronan has strong water binding capacity and an increased tissue content of hyaluronan thus contributes to the development of interstitial oedema. The present study examined the effects of commonly used immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and sirolimus) on fibroblast proliferation, hyaluronan production and cell surface receptor expression. Fibroblasts isolated from rejecting tissue and from normal, non-transplanted tissue were studied in parallel. All substances investigated, except tacrolimus, were found to affect fibroblasts in one way or another. The most striking effect was the almost total inhibition of fibroblast proliferation in the presence of mycophenolic acid. Cyclosporin reduced the proliferation by about 50% and prednisolone had an inhibiting effect on hyaluronan production (50% reduction). These effects were observed on fibroblasts isolated from rat cardiac allografts undergoing rejection as well as on fibroblasts obtained from normal heart tissue. In contrast, sirolimus was found to stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts from rejecting tissue (100% increase), but not that of normal fibroblasts. The majority of the fibroblasts expressed the hyaluronan receptor CD44, with a more intense expression in cultures of fibroblasts derived at rejection. None of the immunosuppressants affected the staining pattern (number of positive cells or intensity).

Two partial related arginase sequences, Onmy-ARG01b and Onmy-ARG02b, and a full-length zebrafish arginase coding region (Danio rerio), Dare-ARG02, are also reported. Comparison of vertebrate arginase sequences shows that both Type I and Type II genes in bony fishes contain a mitochondrial targeting N-terminal domain. This suggests that the cytosolic Type I arginase found in ureotelic vertebrates arose in the common ancestor of amphibia and mammals. Onmy-ARG01 and Onmy-ARG02 mRNA was detected in liver, kidney, gill, intestine, red muscle and heart tissues. Onmy-ARG01 was expressed at a significantly higher level relative to Onmy-ARG02 in liver and red muscle tissue. To investigate whether there was differential regulation of Onmy-ARG01 and Onmy-ARG02, juvenile trout were fasted for 6 weeks and hepatic enzyme activities and mRNA levels were compared with those of fed control fish. There was a 3-fold increase in liver arginase activity and a 2-fold increase in Onmy-ARG02 mRNA levels but no change in Onmy-ARG01 mRNA levels in fasted fish relative to fed fish. These findings indicate that both types of arginase genes are present and expressed in rainbow trout and that the pattern of expression varies between tissues. The increase in liver arginase activity after a 6-week fast is due, in part, to an increase in the expression of Onmy-ARG02 mRNA levels.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2004-05-15", "authors": ["Patricia AWright", "AlishaCampbell", "Robyn LMorgan", "Andrew GRosenberger", "Brent WMurray"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.00958"}
{"title": "Ghrelin induces vasoconstriction in the rat coronary vasculature without altering cardiac peptide secretion.", "abstract": "We administered ghrelin, a novel growth hormone-releasing hormone, to isolated perfused rat hearts, coronary arterioles, and cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes to determine its effects on coronary vascular tone, contractility, and natriuretic peptide secretion and gene expression. We also determined cardiac levels of ghrelin and whether the heart is a source of the circulating peptide. Ghrelin dose dependently increased coronary perfusion pressure (44 +/- 9%, P < 0.01), constricted isolated coronary arterioles (12 +/- 2%, P < 0.05), and significantly enhanced the pressure-induced myogenic tone of arterioles. These effects were blocked by diltiazem, an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, and bisindolylmaleimide (Bis), a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Interestingly, coinfusion of ghrelin with diltiazem completely restored myocardial contractile function that was decreased 30 +/- 3% (P < 0.01) by diltiazem alone. In contrast, combination of ghrelin with diltiazem or Bis did not significantly alter atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion, which was decreased 40% (P < 0.01) and 50% (P < 0.05) by these agents alone, respectively. Administration of ghrelin to cultured cardiomyocytes had no effect on ANP or B-type natriuretic peptide secretion or gene expression. Detectable amounts of low-molecular-weight ghrelin were present in cardiac tissue extracts but not in isolated heart perfusate. Thus we provide the first evidence that ghrelin has a coronary vasoconstrictor action that is dependent on Ca(2+) and PKC. Furthermore, the data obtained from diltiazem infusion suggest that ghrelin has a role in regulation of contractility when L-type Ca(2+) channels are blocked.

We used the Luo-Rudy dynamic model for guinea pig ventricular cells, with simplified Ca2+ handling and transmural heterogeneity in IKs and Ito. With normal cell-to-cell coupling, a layer of M cells was not necessary for the formation of an upright T wave in the simulated electrocardiogram, and the amplitude and configuration of the T wave was not greatly affected by the thickness and configuration of the M cell layer.

We found that the use of agarose plugs for DNA isolation was essential for the accurate measurement of rodent telomere length. Tissue was collected from neonatal (3 days) or aged (18-24 months) male Wistar rats and terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length was measured by Southern blotting. Cardiac tissue from aged rats showed a 38% loss of TRF length compared with newborn animals (p<0.001, n=13), this contrasts with much smaller reductions in brain (1.6%), liver (14.2%), kidney (8.9%) and lung (9.7%). This study demonstrates that the methods of DNA preparation are critical for accurate measurement of telomeres in rodent tissues.

Unsuspected viral infections might also be involved in enhancing autocrine/paracrine mechanisms of cytokine release from omental fat. Elevated levels of blood cytokines may interact with the neuroendocrine system, autonomic nerves and peripheral lymphatic organs. This may lead to local inflammatory reactions in many body compartments, in particular in the heart tissue, possibly affecting the process of circulatory recovery in obese subjects, and predisposing these patients to a greater risk of myocardial inflammatory disease than individuals with normal body mass index. Circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines might be considered to determine risk categories for development of cardiovascular complications in obese subjects.

Our previous study demonstrated that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) possesses potent antioxidative properties.\nTo evaluate the pathogenetic role of oxidative stress in Ang II-induced hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy.\nChronic infusion of Ang II (200 ng/kg per min for 12 days) increased the aortic and cardiac tissue production of superoxide anion (O2) (lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method) by 77 and 35%, respectively. These effects were associated with progressive increases in systolic blood pressure (from 135 to 194 mmHg) and heart/body weight ratio (from 2.25 to 2.69). Chronic treatment with oral ASA alone (100 mg/kg per day for 12 days) significantly reduced aortic and cardiac production of O2 (by 31 and 33%, respectively), without alteration in blood pressure and heart/body weight ratio in control normotensive animals. However, concurrent treatment with ASA in Ang II-infused rats completely prevented the Ang II-induced production of O2, in addition to hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Similar protective effects were observed in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells, in which increases in O2 production and [H]leucine incorporation (221 and 38%, respectively) induced by Ang II (10 mol/l) were totally prevented by concurrent incubation with ASA (10 mol/l). Losartan, but not PD 123319, also blocked the Ang II-induced oxidative and hypertrophic effects in those cells.

We investigated cardiac gene expression in response to acute (24 h) and chronic (14 day) infusion of ANG II in mice; 24-h treatment induces hypertension, and 14-day treatment induces hypertension and extensive cardiac hypertrophy and necrosis. For genes differentially expressed in response to ANG II treatment, we tested for significant regulation of pathways, based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Microarray Pathway Profiler (GenMAPP) databases, as well as functional classes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Both acute and chronic ANG II treatments resulted in decreased expression of mitochondrial metabolic genes, notably those for the electron transport chain and Krebs-TCA cycle; chronic ANG II treatment also resulted in decreased expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. In contrast, genes involved in protein translation and ribosomal activity increased expression following both acute and chronic ANG II treatments. Some classes of genes showed differential response between acute and chronic ANG II treatments. Acute treatment increased expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and amino acid metabolism, whereas chronic treatments increased cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix genes, second messenger cascades responsive to ANG II, and amyloidosis genes. Although a functional linkage between Alzheimer disease, hypertension, and high cholesterol has been previously documented in studies of brain tissue, this is the first demonstration of induction of Alzheimer disease pathways by hypertension in heart tissue.

Moreover, its adverse effects were found to be extended to the cerebral tissue. Several mechanisms for this toxicity have been ascribed. Currently, one of the most accepted mechanisms is through free radicals; however, the exact role of nitric oxide (NO) is still unclear. Accordingly, a NO-synthase inhibitor with some antioxidant property, aminoguanidine (AG), was selected to examine its potential protective effect against DOX-induced toxicity. Male Wistar albino rats (150-200 g) were allocated into a normal control group, DOX-induced toxicity group, and DOX + AG-treated group. DOX was injected i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg divided into four equal injections over a period of 2 weeks. AG was injected i.p. at a dose of 100 mg/kg 1 h before each DOX injection. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last DOX injection and the following parameters were measured: serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activities, cardiac and cerebral contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated diene (CD), glutathione (GSH), NO, and cytosolic calcium, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHP(X)) activities. Cardiotoxicity was manifested by a marked increase in serum LDH and CPK in addition to the sharp increase in MDA reaching eightfolds the basal level. This was accompanied by significant increase in CD, NO, cytosolic calcium, SOD, and GSHP(X) content/activity by 69, 85, 76, 125, and 41% respectively as compared to normal control. On the other hand, GSH was significantly depressed. In brain, only significant increase in MDA and GSHP(X) and decrease in GSH were obtained but to a lesser extent than the cardiac tissue.

AG administration resulted in marked decrease in the elevated levels of MDA, NO, SOD, and GSHP(X), however, MDA level was still pathological. The altered parameters in brain were restored by AG. It is concluded that, AG could not provide complete protection against DOX-induced toxicity.

Studies of the newly recognized GPCRs-in particular, deorphanization of novel GPCRs and experiments that define their signal pathways, expression patterns, desensitization mechanisms, cross-talk with other receptors, and genetic variation-are likely to yield important new insights into cardiovascular cell function. Moreover, these \"new\" GPCRs are attractive targets for the development of drugs for the treatment of cardiac and other cardiovascular disorders.", "journal": "Trends in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2004-05-04", "authors": ["Chih-MinTang", "Paul AInsel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tcm.2003.12.007"}

Rabbits were inoculated 6 cm transcervically with 10(5) to 10(8) colony-forming units/uterine horn of P bivia or with saline solution. Necropsy was scheduled on days 4, 6, or 7 after inoculation. Cultures were collected from blood, uterus, amniotic fluid and fetal brain, lung, and heart. Tissues from placenta, uterus, fetal brain, and lung were evaluated with the histologic inflammation score, with a range of 0 to 13. Amniotic fluid was assayed for tumor necrosis factor-alpha by bioassay. Animals with contamination by other organisms were excluded. Categoric data were evaluated with the use of the Fisher exact test, and continuous data were evaluated with the use of the Wilcoxon rank sum.\nAfter the exclusion of 8 animals because of contamination with other organisms, 22 animals were evaluated. Of 3 rabbits with an inoculum of 10(8) P bivia colony-forming units/horn, 2 animals (67%) had fever within 24 hours. These results were not compatible with chronic, subclinical infection. Therefore, 14 does had inocula of 10(5-6) P bivia colony-forming units/horn, with necropsy planned at day 4 (n=5 animals), day 6 (n=3 animals), and day 7 (n=6 animals), and 5 animals were inoculated with saline solution. Animals that had been inoculated with P bivia were significantly more likely to have a positive culture than were those animals that were inoculated with saline solution (64% vs 0%; P<.04). Preterm delivery without fever occurred in 21% of does (3/14 does) that were inoculated with P bivia overall and in 33% of the does (3/9 does) that were followed for 6 to 7 days. No saline-solution inoculated animal had preterm birth. There was an increase in amniotic fluid tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels over time in the P bivia group (P=.12). Histologic inflammation scores were not significantly different between P bivia and saline solution groups.\nInoculation with P bivia at 10(5-6) colony-forming units/horn leads to chronic intrauterine and fetal infection that are accompanied by preterm birth in up to 33% of cases. This model may serve to explore the mechanism of preterm birth that is induced by chronic infection with genital tract anaerobes.", "journal": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "date": "2004-05-01", "authors": ["Ronald SGibbs", "Robert SMcDuffie", "MirjamKunze", "Jane MBarr", "Douglas MWolf", "Chun-ISze", "RobertShikes", "Michael PSherman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajog.2003.10.700"}

In the past few years, studies have shown that overexpression of HSPs can protect cardiac myocytes against ischemia-reperfusion injury. In an attempt to increase the HSPs in cardiac tissue, we used the compound radicicol that activates HSP expression by binding to the HSP 90 kDa (HSP90). HSP90 is the main component of the cytosolic molecular chaperone complex, which has been implicated in the regulation of the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). HSF1 is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the heat shock genes. In the present study, we show that radicicol induces HSP expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and this increase in HSPs confers cardioprotection to these cardiomyocytes. We also show that radicicol induction of the HSP and cardioprotection is dependent on the inhibition of HSP90 in cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that modulation of the active HSP90 protein level plays an important role in cardioprotection. Therefore, compounds, such as radicicol and its possible derivatives that inhibit the function of HSP90 in the cell may represent potentially useful cardioprotective agents.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Cardiac myocytes express relatively high levels of M6P/IGF2R, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been identified in a variety of cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. However, involvement of M6P/IGF2R in the pathogenesis of these conditions has not been determined. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the role of M6P/IGF2R in regulation of cardiac myocyte growth and apoptosis.\nWe down-regulated the expression of M6P/IGF2R in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and examined the effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Infection of neonatal cardiomyocytes with an adenovirus expressing a ribozyme targeted against the M6P/IGF2R significantly reduced the level of M6P/IGF2R mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR and Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA). M6P-containing protein binding and endocytosis as well as the M6P/IGF2R-mediated internalization of 125I-IGF-II were lower in the ribozyme-treated cells than the control myocytes, indicating that the number of functional M6P/IGF2R in the ribozyme treated cells was reduced. Accordingly, a marked increase in cell proliferation and a reduced cell susceptibility to hypoxia- and TNF-induced apoptosis were observed in the ribozyme-treated cells.\nThese findings suggest that M6P/IGF2R may play a role in regulation of cardiac myocyte growth and apoptosis.

A modified Ringer solution with 25 mM KCl (pH 7.6+/-0.1 at 22 degrees C) and the St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution (pH 7.8+/-0.1 at 22 degrees C) were used as controls. Osmolarity of all cardioplegic solutions were 340+/-5. After 20-min initial perfusion according to Neely (steady state) the hearts were subjected to 40-min normothermal total ischemia followed by 30-min antegrade reperfusion. Cardioplegic solutions were infused prior to ischemia at rate of the initial coronary flow for 5 min at room temperature. During reperfusion the hearts of CP-5 group completely recovered coronary flow and significantly enhanced restoration of the majority functional indices compared to the hearts in both control groups. This effect was combined with less lactate accumulation and preservation of higher ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels in the heart tissue by the end of ischemia and, probably was induced by inclusion of aspartic acid into composition of CP-5. By the end of reperfusion the hearts treated with CP-5 completely recovered PCr content and restored ATP level up to 65.2+/-4.6% of initial one. A better energy state of reperfused hearts in CP-5 group was accompanied by reduction of myocardial lactate tissue to the preischemic value. Restoration of ATP, PCr and lactate content was significantly poor in both control groups during reperfusion. The least formation of a spin adduct of the short life oxygen radicals was found in the myocardial effluent of the hearts of CP-5 group at the early reperfusion using EPR technique. These data suggest a reduced release of oxygen radical generating systems from postischemic myocardium into perfusate due to antioxidant effect of mannitol.

{"title": "The regulation and importance of glucose uptake in the isolated Atlantic cod heart: rate-limiting steps and effects of hypoxia.", "abstract": "This study investigated the regulation of glucose uptake in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) hearts. Isolated hearts were perfused with or without glucose in the medium, under either normoxic or severely hypoxic conditions. Working at basal levels, hearts did not require extracellular glucose to maintain power under aerobic conditions. However, cardiac performance was significantly reduced without exogenous glucose under oxygen-limiting conditions. The addition of the glucose transporter inhibitor cytochalasin B caused hypoxic hearts to fail early, and hearts perfused with a glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), increased glucose uptake 3-fold under hypoxia. The uptake of 2-DG was only partially inhibited when cytochalasin B was added to the medium. Isolated ventricle strips were also incubated in the presence of 2-DG and the extracellular marker mannitol. Glucose uptake (glucose transport plus intracellular phosphorylation) was assessed by measuring the initial rate of 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2-DG-6-P) accumulation. At 1 mmol l(-1) 2-DG, the rate of 2-DG uptake remained linear for 60 min, and 2-DG-6-P, but not free 2-DG, accumulation was increased. The fact that intracellular 2-DG did not increase indicates that glucose transport is the rate-limiting step for glucose utilization in non-stimulated cardiac tissue. Replacement of Na(+) by choline in the incubation medium did not affect 2-DG uptake, providing evidence that Na(+)-coupled glucose transport is absent in cod cardiac tissue. Similar to cytochalasin B, glucose uptake was also inhibited by phloridzin, suggesting that facilitated, carrier-mediated glucose transport occurs in cod hearts. Under the conditions employed in these experiments, it is clear that (1) activation of glucose transport is required to support hypoxic performance, (2) the rate-limiting step for glucose utilization is glucose transport rather than glucose phosphorylation, (3) 2-DG uptake accurately reflects glucose transport activity and (4) glucose uptake in cod hearts does not involve an Na(+)-dependent mechanism.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2004-04-27", "authors": ["Kathy AClow", "Kenneth JRodnick", "Tyson JMacCormack", "William RDriedzic"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.00965"}

However, the involvement of hyaluronan during xenograft rejection has previously not been investigated. The aims of this study were to characterize hyaluronan content and distribution during rejection of concordant mouse-to-rat cardiac xenografts, and to explore the effects of hyaluronidase (HAse) on xenograft survival.\nGraft recipients were treated with 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG) or both HAse and DSG. Grafts were removed on day 5 from some of the animals to analyse hyaluronan and water content, while other animals were used to investigate graft survival. The hyaluronan content was measured by a radiometric assay and the distribution was analysed by histochemical staining.\nIn xenografts undergoing rejection (the DSG group) there was a strong increase of the hyaluronan [555 +/- 93 microg/g dry weight (dw)] and water (82.7 +/- 0.4%) contents compared with normal mouse heart tissue (166 +/- 10 microg/g dw; P < 0.01 and 78.6 +/- 0.5%; P < 0.001, respectively). The combined use of HAse and DSG reduced the accumulation of hyaluronan (284 +/- 43 microg/g dw; P < 0.05 vs. DSG) but did not affect the average water content. The average graft survival time did not differ between the groups; however, three grafts in the HAse + DSG-treatment group survived much longer than the longest-surviving grafts in the DSG group.\nThese data suggest that the graft content of hyaluronan considerably increases during xenograft rejection.

{"title": "TGF-beta1 overexpression: a mechanism of diastolic filling dysfunction in the aged population.", "abstract": "The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the United States dramatically increases with age. A hallmark feature of the aged myocardium is increased fibrosis resulting in diastolic dysfunction. Moreover, the survival of patients subsequent to a myocardial infarction is inversely related to age because of a certain extent to maladaptive remodeling mediated by cardiac fibroblasts. Our hypothesis is that cardiac fibroblast (CF) dysfunction results in overexpressed TGF-beta1 leading to increased cardiac collagen content in the aged population. TGF-beta1 stimulates the synthesis of the extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen in the cardiac tissues. The RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression of TGF-beta1 of the CF was increased by 43% in the aged mice as compared to the younger. The stiffness of the left ventricle is expressed with the slope of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship parameter, beta (mmHg/microL). In a mouse model, we demonstrated that beta was 0.30 +/- 0.05 in the young as compared to 0.52 +/- 0.10 in the aged (p < .05). The ventricular stiffness was associated with the myocardial collagen content; namely, young versus the aged was 9.5 +/- 4.0 as compared to 16.4 +/- 2.3% of total protein, respectively (p < .05). In conclusion, the gene structure-function relationships support our hypothesis that cardiac fibroblast disregulation contributes to diastolic filling dysfunction in elderly persons.

On the other hand, another strategy for protecting against oxidative/electrophilic cardiac injury may be through induction of the endogenous antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes in myocardium by chemical inducers. However, our understanding of the chemical inducibility of cardiac antioxidants/phase 2 enzymes in vivo is very limited. In addition, careful studies on the basal levels of a scope of endogenous antioxidants/phase 2 enzymes in myocardium as compared with other tissues, such as liver, are lacking. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to determine the basal levels of endogenous antioxidants/phase 2 enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH), GSH peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), GSH S-transferase (GST), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and investigate the inducibility of the above antioxidants/phase 2 enzymes by the chemoprotectant, 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), in cardiac as well as hepatic tissues in C57BL/6 mice. Our results demonstrated that in C57BL/6 mice, the levels of catalase, GSH, GPx, GR, and GST were significantly lower in cardiac tissue than in hepatic tissue. The level of total SOD did not differ significantly between mouse heart and liver. Notably, heart contained a much higher NQO1 activity than liver. Immunoblotting and RT-PCR analyses further demonstrated the high expression of NQO1 protein and mRNA in myocardium. Oral administration of D3T at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/kg body weight for 3 consecutive days resulted in a significant induction of cardiac SOD, catalase, GR, GST, and NQO1. No significant induction of cardiac GSH and GPx was observed with the above D3T treatment. Only GR, GST, and NQO1 in mouse liver were induced by the D3T treatment. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant D3T dose-dependent decrease in hepatic GPx activity. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that: (1) the expression of NQO1 is remarkably high in mouse myocardium though other cardiac antioxidants/phase 2 enzymes are relatively lower as compared with liver; (2) a number of endogenous antioxidants/phase 2 enzymes in mouse cardiac tissue can be significantly induced by D3T following oral administration; and (3) the inducibility of endogenous antioxidants/phase 2 enzymes by D3T differs between mouse cardiac and hepatic tissues.

{"title": "Role of gap junctions in the propagation of the cardiac action potential.", "abstract": "Gap junctions play a pivotal role for the velocity and the safety of impulse propagation in cardiac tissue. Under physiologic conditions, the specific subcellular distribution of gap junctions together with the tight packaging of the rod-shaped cardiomyocytes underlies anisotropic conduction, which is continuous at the macroscopic scale. However, when breaking down the three-dimensional network of cells into linear single cell chains, gap junctions can be shown to limit axial current flow and to induce 'saltatory' conduction at unchanged overall conduction velocities. In two- and three-dimensional tissue, these discontinuities disappear due to lateral averaging of depolarizing current flow at the activation wavefront. During gap junctional uncoupling, discontinuities reappear and are accompanied by slowed and meandering conduction. Critical gap junctional uncoupling reduces conduction velocities to a much larger extent than does a reduction of excitability, which suggests that the safety for conduction is higher at any given conduction velocity for gap junctional uncoupling. In uniformly structured tissue, gap junctional uncoupling is accompanied by a parallel decrease in conduction velocity. However, this is not necessarily the case for non-uniform structures like tissue expansion where partial uncoupling paradoxically increases conduction velocity and has the capacity to remove unidirectional conduction blocks. Whereas the impact of gap junctions on impulse conduction is generally assessed from the point of view of cell coupling among cardiomyocytes, it is possible that other cell types within the myocardium might be coupled to cardiomyocytes as well. In this context, it has been shown that fibroblasts establish successful conduction between sheets of cardiomyocytes over distances as long as 300 microm. This might not only explain electrical synchronization of heart transplants but might be of importance for cardiac diseases involving fibrosis. Finally, the intriguing fact that sodium channels are clustered at the intercalated disc recently rekindled the provocative question of whether gap junctions alone are responsible for impulse propagation or whether electric field mechanisms might account for conduction as well. Whereas computer simulations show the feasibility of conduction in the absence of gap junctional coupling, a definite answer to this question must await further investigations into the biophysical properties of the intercalated disc.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2004-04-20", "authors": ["StephanRohr"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.035"}

In addition, when exposed to a 14-wk high-fat diet, RXRgamma -/- mice had less weight gain, which was entirely due to lower fat mass (11.9 +/- 1.8 vs. 14.4 +/- 1.1 g; P = 0.01), and leptin levels were also lower in the RXRgamma -/- mice (17.6 +/- 5.0 vs. 30.9 +/- 6.4 ng/ml; P = 0.03). These data suggest that RXRgamma -/- mice are resistant to gain in fat mass in response to high-fat feeding. This occurs, at least in part, through up-regulation of LPL activity in skeletal muscle. An understanding of the mechanisms governing the role of RXR in TG disposal and metabolism may lead to the rational design of RXR-selective agonists and antagonists that may be useful in common disorders such as dyslipidemia and obesity.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2004-04-17", "authors": ["Bryan RHaugen", "Dalan RJensen", "VibhaSharma", "Leslie KPulawa", "William RHays", "WojciechKrezel", "PierreChambon", "Robert HEckel"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2003-1401"}

HTC-3012 (3-100 microM), in spite of inhibition of 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) generation by the cardiac tissues, brought about a dose-dependent normalization of coronary perfusion pressure, associated with a reduction of ventricular contracture during ischemia with remarkable improvement of left ventricular developed pressure at reperfusion. These beneficial effects were accompanied by a substantial release of nitrite/nitrate in the heart perfusates, indicating that NO has been released by HCT-3012 and donated to the cardiac tissue. These events were paralleled by a significant reduction of creatine kinase activity in heart perfusates during reperfusion. Naproxen (10-100 microM) aggravated the myocardial damage in ischemic reperfused hearts, severely depressing the postischemic ventricular dysfunction. Perfusion of the heart with N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (10 microM) caused a marked aggravation of myocardial damage of the reperfused hearts, and this effect was dose dependently prevented by HCT-3012 but not by naproxen. The results of the present experiments clearly indicate that HCT-3012, by donating NO, displays a noticeable anti-ischemic effect in reperfused ischemic rabbit hearts. The safer gastrointestinal profile of HCT-3012 and its ability to control experimental hypertension, suggest that this compound may have therapeutical potential in cardiovascular disease, namely in the prevention of myocardial ischemic events, and may represent a better alternative to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2004-04-15", "authors": ["GiuseppeRossoni", "BarbaraManfredi", "PieroDel Soldato", "FerruccioBerti"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.104.067397"}

ACE 2 degrades angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang (1-7) and Ang I to Ang (1-9). We investigated the expression of ACE and ACE 2 in a rodent model of type 2 diabetes. ACE and ACE 2 were measured in kidney and heart from 8-week-old no diabetic control (db/m) mice and diabetic (db/db) mice, which at this young age have obesity and hyperglycemia without nephropathy.

Endotoxin (15 mg/kg) was administered intravascularly to anesthetized animals, and heart tissue was harvested 150 min later.\nUsing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we found that hypothermia induced myocardial expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, while decreasing concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and growth-related oncogene/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (rat homolog of IL-8). Electromobility shift assay revealed that hypothermia inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays revealed that hypothermia attenuated the endotoxin-induced overexpression of both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) messenger RNA and iNOS protein, respectively. Hypothermia also attenuated nitric oxide-mediated myocardial protein damage, as determined by a nitrotyrosine ELISA. Myocardial myeloperoxidase content, an indicator of neutrophil accumulation and oxidative activity, was also inhibited by hypothermia in endotoxemic rats.\nThese data demonstrate that hypothermia induces an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, inhibits neutrophil aggregation, and inhibits the formation of nitric oxide during endotoxemia in the rat.", "journal": "Chest", "date": "2004-04-14", "authors": ["Philip OScumpia", "Paul JSarcia", "Kindra MKelly", "Vincent GDeMarco", "Jeffrey WSkimming"], "doi": "10.1378/chest.125.4.1483"}

The two genes exhibit dynamic patterns of expression in epithelial tissues adjacent to Htl-expressing mesoderm derivatives, including the neurogenic ectoderm, stomadeum, and hindgut. Embryos that lack ths+ and pyr+ exhibit defects related to those seen in htl mutants, including delayed mesodermal migration during gastrulation and a loss of cardiac tissues and hindgut musculature. The misexpression of Ths in wild-type and mutant embryos suggests that FGF signaling is required for both cell migration and the transcriptional induction of cardiac gene expression. The characterization of htl and ths regulatory DNAs indicates that high levels of the maternal Dorsal gradient directly activate htl expression, whereas low levels activate ths.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a known component of the ischaemic milieu. We examined its arrhythmogenic activity, and its interaction with two other putative mediators, norepinephrine and K(+), using an ischaemia-free in vitro heart bioassay, and a specific PAF antagonist (BN-50739). PAF (0.1-100 nmol) was administered selectively to the left coronary bed of rat isolated hearts using a specially designed catheter. In some hearts, PAF was administered to the left coronary bed during concomitant regional perfusion with norepinephrine and/or K(+). In separate studies, PAF accumulation in the perfused cardiac tissue was evaluated using (3)H-PAF. PAF evoked ventricular arrhythmias concentration-dependently (P<0.05). It also widened QT interval and reduced coronary flow selectively in the PAF-exposed left coronary bed (both P<0.05). Two exposures of hearts to PAF were necessary to evoke the QT and rhythm effects. The PAF-induced arrhythmias and coronary vasoconstriction were partially suppressed by the PAF antagonist BN-50739 (10 microm), although BN-50739 itself widened QT interval. K(+) (8 and 15 mm) unexpectedly antagonised the arrhythmogenic effects of PAF without itself eliciting arrhythmias (P<0.05). Norepinephrine (0.1 microm) had little or no effect on the actions of PAF, while failing to evoke arrhythmias itself. Nevertheless, the combination of 15 mm K(+) and 0.1 microm norepinephrine evoked arrhythmias of a severity similar to arrhythmias evoked by PAF alone, without adding to or diminishing the arrhythmogenic effects of PAF. (3)H-PAF accumulated in the cardiac tissue, with 43+/-5% still present 5 min after bolus administration, accounting for the need for two exposures of the heart to PAF for evocation of arrhythmias. Thus, PAF, by activating specific receptors in the ventricle, can be expected to contribute to arrhythmogenesis during ischaemia. However, its interaction with other components of the ischaemic milieu is complex, and selective block of its actions (or its accumulation) in the ischaemic milieu is alone unlikely to reduce VF/SCD.", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "date": "2004-04-07", "authors": ["Kathryn EBaker", "Michael JCurtis"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.bjp.0705767"}

In contrast, NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase activities were not affected by hypoxia. The activity of rat heart mtNOS decreased 20% on aging from 12 to 72 weeks of age. On the pharmacological side, mitochondrial NO production was increased after enalapril treatment (the inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme) with modification of heart mtNOS functional activity in the regulation of mitochondrial O(2) uptake and H(2)O(2) production. Thus, heart mtNOS is a highly regulated mitochondrial enzyme, which in turn, plays a regulatory role through mitochondrial NO steady state levels that modulate O(2) uptake and O(2)(-) and H(2)O(2) production rates. Nitric oxide and H(2)O(2) constitute signals for metabolic control that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes, such as proliferation and apoptosis.", "journal": "Molecular aspects of medicine", "date": "2004-03-31", "authors": ["Laura BValdez", "TamaraZaobornyj", "SilviaAlvarez", "JuanitaBustamante", "Lidia ECosta", "AlbertoBoveris"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mam.2004.02.008"}

AP conduction is the outcome of complex interactions between cellular electrical activity, electrical cell-to-cell communication, and the cardiac tissue structure. As shown in this review, strong interactions occur among these determinants of electrical impulse propagation. A special form of conduction that underlies many cardiac arrhythmias involves circulating excitation. In this situation, the curvature of the propagating excitation wavefront and the interaction of the wavefront with the repolarization tail of the preceding wave are additional important determinants of impulse propagation.

In this study, we sought to assess the effects of alfentanil on contractility and the cytosolic Ca(2+) transient in ventricular myocytes isolated from the rat ventricle by enzymatic dispersion. Cells were loaded with fura-2 and electrically stimulated at 1 Hz, and Ca(2+) transients and contractions were recorded optically at 30 degrees C. Alfentanil 10(-8) and 10(-7) M had no effect on the magnitude or time course of contraction or the cytosolic Ca(2+) transient. In contrast, 10(-6) M alfentanil induced a significant (P < 0.001) positive inotropic effect, increasing the mean (+/-SEM) unloaded shortening from 7.3 +/- 1.3 microm to 8.7 +/- 1.4 microm (an increase of 20%), with no change in the cytosolic Ca(2+) transient. Myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity was significantly (P = 0.027) increased by 10(-6) M alfentanil but unaffected at 10(-7) M alfentanil. These data show that 10(-6) M alfentanil, a concentration close to the maximum clinical free plasma concentration, induced a positive inotropic effect due to sensitization of the myofilaments to Ca(2+) rather than to modified cytosolic Ca(2+) regulation.\nAlfentanil, at concentrations achieved in clinical practice, increased contraction in ventricular cells by a mechanism involving an increase in the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to Ca(2+).", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "date": "2004-03-26", "authors": ["Mark DGraham", "Philip MHopkins", "Simon MHarrison"], "doi": "10.1213/01.ANE.0000104481.20813.35"}

We have demonstrated that infiltrating CD4+ T cell clones were able to recognize several heart tissue and streptococcal antigens by molecular mimicry. Clonality analysis of the mitral valve and myocardium infiltrating T cell lines showed several oligoclonal expansions, some of which were found in both sites of the lesions. The results presented in this study showed a degenerate pattern of reactivity of intralesional T cell clones from one RHD patient. Four mitral valve and one papillar muscle-derived T cell clones, presenting the same TCR-BV13 BJ2S7 with same sequences of the CDR3 region recognized different antigens. They expressed two alpha chains at the RNA level and the AV AJ segments were the same for mitral valve T cell clones, but not for the papillar muscle-derived T cell clone. Two other intralesional T cell clones using the same TCR-BV3 JB2S1 segments with identical CDR3 sequences also recognized different antigens. These results indicate that intralesional T cell clones with common TCR usage can recognize several epitopes that probably amplify the deleterious immune reaction. These data, allow us to hypothesize that degenerate T cell recognition may lead to intramolecular degenerate reactivity against epitopes with low homology.

A growing number of investigators have implicated adult bone marrow (BM) in this process, suggesting that marrow serves as a reservoir for cardiac precursor cells. It remains unclear which BM cell(s) can contribute to myocardium, and whether they do so by transdifferentiation or cell fusion. Here, we studied the ability of c-kit-enriched BM cells, Lin- c-kit+ BM cells and c-kit+ Thy1.1(lo) Lin- Sca-1+ long-term reconstituting haematopoietic stem cells to regenerate myocardium in an infarct model. Cells were isolated from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and injected directly into ischaemic myocardium of wild-type mice. Abundant GFP+ cells were detected in the myocardium after 10 days, but by 30 days, few cells were detectable. These GFP+ cells did not express cardiac tissue-specific markers, but rather, most of them expressed the haematopoietic marker CD45 and myeloid marker Gr-1. We also studied the role of circulating cells in the repair of ischaemic myocardium using GFP+-GFP- parabiotic mice. Again, we found no evidence of myocardial regeneration from blood-borne partner-derived cells. Our data suggest that even in the microenvironment of the injured heart, c-kit-enriched BM cells, Lin- c-kit+ BM cells and c-kit+ Thy1.1(lo) Lin- Sca-1+ long-term reconstituting haematopoietic stem cells adopt only traditional haematopoietic fates.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2004-03-23", "authors": ["Leora BBalsam", "Amy JWagers", "Julie LChristensen", "TheoKofidis", "Irving LWeissman", "Robert CRobbins"], "doi": "10.1038/nature02460"}

A body of evidence implicates human heart mast cells (HHMCs) in anaphylaxis. These cells have been identified perivascularly, in dose proximity to myocytes and in the arterial intima in human heart tissue. The membrane surface of mast cells from human heart tissue of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation expresses the high affinity receptors for IgE (FcepsilonRI) and C5a receptors. Activation of HHMCs in vitro with anti-IgE or anti-FcepsilonRI induced the release of preformed mediators (histamine, tryptase and chymase) and the de novo synthesis of LTC4 (approximately equal to 18 ng/10(6) cells) and PGD2 (approximately equal to 18 ng/10(6) cells). Complement activation and anaphylatoxin formation occur during anaphylaxis in human. C5a caused rapid release of histamine and tryptase from HHMCs. These cells are activated in vitro by therapeutic (general anaesthetics, protamine, etc.) and diagnostic agents (radio contrast media, etc.) that may cause non-IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions. Administration of low concentrations of histamine and cysteinyl leukotrienes in subjects undergoing diagnostic catheterization caused significant systemic and coronary haemodynamic effects.

{"title": "Inhibitors of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in guinea pig isolated ischemic hearts.", "abstract": "During heart ischemia, ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the sarcolemmal membrane (sarcK(ATP)) open and cause shortening of the action potential duration. This creates heterogeneity of repolarization, being responsible for the development of re-entry arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the aim is to develop selective blockers of the cardiac sarcK(ATP) channel. In the present study we established an in vitro model and classified 5 K(ATP) channel inhibitors with respect to their potency and selectivity between cardiomyocytes and the coronary vasculature and compared the results with inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR2A channels expressed in HEK293 cells, recorded with the Rb(+)-efflux methods. We used Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts, where low-flow ischemia plus hypoxia was performed by reducing the coronary flow (CF) to 1.2 ml/min and by gassing the perfusion solution with N(2) instead of O(2). Throughout the experiment, the monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD(90)) was recorded. In separate experiments, high-flow hypoxia was produced by oxygen reduction in the perfusate from 95% to 20%, which caused an increase in the coronary flow. Under normoxic conditions, the substances glibenclamide, repaglinide, meglitinide, HMR 1402 and HMR 1098 (1 microM each) reduced the CF by 34%, 38%, 19%, 12% and 5%, respectively. The hypoxia-induced increase in CF was inhibited by the compounds half-maximally at 25 nM, approximately 200 nM, 600 nM, approximately 9 microM and >100 microM, respectively. In control experiments after 5 min low-flow ischemia plus hypoxia, the MAPD(90) shortened from 121+/-2 to 99+/-2 ms ( n=29). This shortening was half-maximally inhibited by the substances at concentrations of 95 nM, 74 nM, 400 nM, 110 nM and 550 nM, respectively. In HEK293 cells the Rb(+)-efflux through KIR6.2/SUR2A channels was inhibited by the compounds with IC(50) values of 21 nM, 67 nM, 205 nM, 60 nM and 181 nM, respectively. In summary, the present data demonstrate that the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, and the carbamoylbenzoic acid derivatives repaglinide and meglitinide are unselective blockers of K(ATP) channels in cardiac cells and in the cardiac vascular system, whereas the sulfonylthioureas HMR 1402, and especially HMR 1098 selectively blocked the cardiac sarcK(ATP) channel.

In 64 cardiac surgical patients, serial blood samples were drawn for the measurement of S100B and troponin I before surgery and for seven days after surgery. Neurological function was assessed before with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the Folstein Mini Mental Test. The data show that a sustained increase in serum S100B levels is associated with neurological dysfunction, as witnessed by a positive correlation between S100B values and the results of the neuropsychological tests.

{"title": "Effects of chronic endothelin-1 stimulation on cardiac myocyte contractile function.", "abstract": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has acute positive inotropic effects, but consequences of chronically increased ET-1 on contractile function of cardiac myocytes are largely unknown. In the present study, effects of long-term treatment with ET-1 (10 nM) for 5 days on both force development [force of contraction (FOC)] and kinetics of contraction were determined in heart tissue reconstituted from rat cardiac cells. Isometric force was measured in response to cumulative concentrations of Ca(2+) and isoprenaline. ET-1 augmented basal FOC by 64 +/- 11% (P < 0.05), which was associated with a significantly blunted contractile response to Ca(2+) and isoprenaline. Moreover, ET-1 significantly prolonged relaxation (62 +/- 3 vs. 53 +/- 2 ms). Selective ET(A) (BQ-123) and ET(B) receptor blockade (BQ-788) demonstrated that effects of ET-1 on contractile function were mediated through the ET(A) receptor subtype. Effects of ET-1 were prevented by cotreatment with either Ro31-8425, a PKC inhibitor, or dimethylamiloride, an inhibitor of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. In contrast to long-term ET-1 treatment, no changes in contractile parameters were observed after ET-1 treatment for 3 h before force measurement. These data suggest that chronic ET-1 stimulation has dual effects on contractility: improvement of basal force but impairment of twitch kinetics and inotropic responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The signaling pathways involved include ET(A) receptors, PKC, and the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. The present in vitro findings raise the possibility that ET-1 may exert both adaptive and maladaptive effects in the failing myocardium in which local accumulation of ET-1 is present.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The electrochemical activation (anodic oxidation) procedure for the circular Ir microelectrode was investigated using the square wave potential according to the electrode size, number of cycles, and cathodic-anodic potential level of the square wave. Increase in the charge storage capacity was pronounced either in smaller electrodes or with higher potential level of the square wave. The electrode impedance reduced in a similar manner with increasing number of cycle irrespective of the electrode size. With either lower potential level (-0.70/+0.60 V) or smaller number of cycle (200 cycles) than those for the activation of stimulating electrode, the likelihood of overactivation of the recording microelectrode can be minimized.

Recently, we showed that cardiac myocytes from perinatal rats transiently express the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B, the function of which in heart is unknown. To characterize the cardiac NR2B protein, we determined its subcellular distribution and specific molecular interaction partners. By immunostaining of rat heart tissue slices and acutely dissociated cardiac myocytes, the NR2B antigen was localized at the sarcomeric Z-bands. Using immunoprecipitation of detergent-solubilized NR2B protein and subsequent analysis employing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, ryanodine receptor 2 was identified as a molecular interaction partner of the cardiac NR2B polypeptide. Differences in antibody recognition indicate that the cardiac NR2B polypeptide carries a structurally altered C terminus as compared with the NR2B variant prevalent in central nervous system.

We focus on two possible mechanisms for the generation of reentrant events. We first investigate if early-after-depolarizations occurring in M cells can initiate reentry. We find that, even for large values of the long QT strength, the electrotonic coupling between neighboring cells prevents early-after-depolarizations from creating a reentry. We then study whether M cell domains, with their slow repolarization, can function as wave blocks for premature stimuli.

This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of the two eigenmodes present in the model, which have fundamentally different characteristics. One mode decays very rapidly with space, implying that the associated membrane potential is only present with appreciable amplitude within a few space constants of the tissue surface. The other mode, however, is not directly dependent on the value of the space constant, and allows deep penetration of the membrane potential and, by implication, its associated defibrillating effects. For deep membrane potentials to be generated by this mechanism, the intracellular and extracellular resistivity anisotropy ratios must be unequal, as is typically the case in cardiac tissue.

After 5 wk of treatment, sera were used for protein and lipid determinations. Protein, glycogen, triacylglycerol, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A dehydrogenase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, lipoperoxide, and lipid hydroperoxide were measured in cardiac tissue.\nThe SFA group had higher triacylglycerol, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and atherogenic index (ratio of cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein) than did the PUFA and control groups. The PUFA group had low serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as compared with the SFA group. SFA increased myocardial lipid hydroperoxide and diminished glutathione peroxidase. Despite the beneficial effects on serum lipids, the PUFA diet led to the highest levels of myocardial lipoperoxide and lipid hydroperoxide and diminished superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. The PUFA effects were related to increased feed efficiency, increased susceptibility to lipoperoxidation, and metabolic shifting in cardiac tissue. PUFA elevated triacylglycerol levels and decreased myocardial glycogen concentrations. The ratios of lactate dehydrogenase to citrate synthase and beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A dehydrogenase to citrate synthase were increased, indicating myocardial reduction of tricarboxylic acid cycle.\nPUFAs have been recommended as a therapeutic measure in preventive medicine to lower serum cholesterol, but PUFAs increased oxidative stress in the heart by providing cardiac susceptibility to lipoperoxidation and shifting the metabolic pathway for energy production.

These focally damaged regions constitute 0-5% of cardiac tissue. In cardiomyopathy arising from sarcoglycan mutations, we found that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly increased in focally damaged cardiac myocytes. In addition, we noted that nitric oxide (NO) was also increased in regions of tissue damage and altered membrane permeability. In sarcoglycan mutant mice, regionally increased cardiac NO was associated with hypersensitivity to carbachol and decreased sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation. Inhibition of NO production in sarcoglycan mutant mice was associated with improved recovery after carbachol and isoproterenol infusion.

Various paradigms have been suggested, including ANGII-mediated up-regulation of collagen types I and III formation and deposition in cardiac conditions, such as HHD. A growing body of evidence, however, deals with the potential role of aldosterone, either local or systemic, in inducing cardiac fibrosis. Aldosterone might also mediate the profibrotic actions of ANGII. To reduce the risk of heart failure that accompanies HHD, its adverse structural remodeling (eg, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis) must be targeted for pharmacologic intervention.

{"title": "Characterization of the effects of oxygen on xanthine oxidase-mediated nitric oxide formation.", "abstract": "Under anaerobic conditions, xanthine oxidase (XO)-catalyzed nitrite reduction can be an important source of nitric oxide (NO). However, questions remain regarding whether significant XO-mediated NO generation also occurs under aerobic conditions. Therefore, electron paramagnetic resonance, chemiluminescence NO-analyzer, and NO-electrode studies were performed to characterize the kinetics and magnitude of XO-mediated nitrite reduction as a function of oxygen tension. With substrates xanthine or 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde that provide electrons to XO at the molybdenum site, the rate of NO production followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and oxygen functioned as a competitive inhibitor of nitrite reduction. However, with flavin-adenine dinucleotide site-binding substrate NADH as electron donor, aerobic NO production was maintained at more than 70% of anaerobic levels, and binding of NADH to the flavin-adenine dinucleotide site seemed to prevent oxygen binding. Therefore, under aerobic conditions, NADH would be the main electron donor for XO-catalyzed NO production in tissues. Studies of the pH dependence of NO formation indicated that lower pH values decrease oxygen reduction but greatly increase nitrite reduction, facilitating NO generation. Isotope tracer studies demonstrated that XO-mediated NO formation occurs in normoxic and hypoxic heart tissue. Thus, XO-mediated NO generation occurs under aerobic conditions and is regulated by oxygen tension, pH, nitrite, and reducing substrate concentrations.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2004-02-10", "authors": ["HaitaoLi", "AlexandreSamouilov", "XiaopingLiu", "Jay LZweier"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M314336200"}
{"title": "Role of cyclooxygenase in ventricular effects of adrenomedullin: is adrenomedullin a double-edged sword in sepsis?", "abstract": "Adrenomedullin (ADM) is upregulated in cardiac tissue under various pathophysiological conditions. However, the direct inotropic effect of ADM on normal and compromised cardiomyocytes is not clear. In rat ventricular myocytes, ADM produced an initial (<30 min) increase in cell shortening and Ca(2+) transient and, on prolonged incubation (>1 h), a marked decrease in cell shortening and Ca(2+) transient. Both effects were sensitive to inhibition by the ADM antagonist ADM-(22-52). The increase and decrease in cell shortening and Ca(2+) transient were attenuated by pretreatment with indomethacin [a nonspecific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor], nimesulide and SC-236 (specific COX-2 inhibitors), and tranylcypromine (a prostacyclin synthase inhibitor); SQ-29548 (a thromboxane receptor antagonist) was without effect. Cells isolated from LPS-treated rats that were in the late, hypodynamic phase of septic shock also showed a marked decrease in cell shortening and Ca(2+) transient. Because ADM is overexpressed in sepsis, we repeated the above protocol in cells isolated from LPS-treated rats. At 4 h after LPS injection, ADM levels markedly increased in plasma, ventricles, and freshly isolated ventricular myocytes. Decreases in cell shortening and Ca(2+) transient in LPS-treated cells were reversed by pretreatment with ADM-(22-52). Anti-ADM (rat) IgG also reversed the decrease in cell shortening and other parameters of cell kinetics. Indomethacin, SC-236, and tranylcypromine restored cell contractility and the decrease in Ca(2+) transient, whereas SQ-29548 had no effect, implying that prostacyclin played a role in both effects. However, with regard to cell-shortening kinetics, indomethacin and SQ-29548 decreased the amount of time taken by the cells to return to baseline, whereas SC-236 and tranylcypromine did not, implying that not only prostacyclin, but also thromboxane, is involved.

First, we attempt to review the reports available on the role of I(Ks) in myocardial repolarization.

However, results obtained with I(Ks) blockers, like chromanol 293B or L-735,821, are conflicting, since from slight lengthening to marked prolongation of action potentials were equally obtained. Although these contradictory results were explained by interspecies or regional differences, the role of I(Ks) in repolarization is a matter of growing dispute. In the second part of this study, we simulated the performance of I(Ks) during cardiac action potentials. We compared the profile of the predicted current in three mathematical models in order to determine the relative role of the current in repolarization. We studied the effect of the cycle length, action potential duration and height of the plateau on the profile of I(Ks) in epicardiac, endocardiac and midmyocardiac ventricular action potentials. The results indicate that the height of the plateau is the most important parameter to control activation of I(Ks)in cardiac tissues, and accordingly, the interspecies and regional differences observed in the efficacy of I(Ks) blockers are likely due to the known differences in action potential morphology. We conclude also that I(Ks)blockade may have unpredictable effects on the length of the action potential in a diseased heart, questioning the possible therapeutic value of drugs blocking I(Ks).", "journal": "Current medicinal chemistry", "date": "2004-02-03", "authors": ["Tam\u00e1sB\u00e1ny\u00e1sz", "RolandKoncz", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3F\u00fcl\u00f6p", "NorbertSzentandr\u00e1ssy", "J\u00e1nosMagyar", "P\u00e9ter PN\u00e1n\u00e1si"], "doi": "10.2174/0929867043456304"}

Levosimendan was a 40-fold more potent and a 3-fold more selective phosphodiesterase III inhibitor (IC(50) for phosphodiesterase III=2.5 nM, and IC(50) for phosphodiesterase IV=25 microM, selectivity factor approximately 10000) than OR-1896 (IC(50) for phosphodiesterase III=94 nM, and IC(50) for phosphodiesterase IV=286 microM, selectivity factor approximately 3000). Hence, our data support the hypothesis that levosimendan and OR-1896 both exert positive inotropy via a Ca(2+)-sensitizing mechanism and not via simultaneous inhibition of the phosphodiesterases III and IV isozymes in the myocardium at their maximal free plasma concentrations.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2004-01-31", "authors": ["SzabolcsSzil\u00e1gyi", "PieroPollesello", "JoukoLevijoki", "PetriKaheinen", "HeimoHaikala", "Istv\u00e1nEdes", "Zolt\u00e1nPapp"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2003.12.005"}

Syngeneic bone marrow cell transplantation has been shown to cause repair and improvement of heart function in a number of studies in patients and animal models of ischemic cardiopathy. The effects of bone marrow transplant in a mouse model of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, in the presence of the disease causal agent, ie, the T. cruzi, are described herein. Bone marrow cells injected intravenously into chronic chagasic mice migrated to the heart and caused a significant reduction in the inflammatory infiltrates and in the interstitial fibrosis characteristics of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. The beneficial effects were observed up to 6 months after bone marrow cell transplantation. A massive apoptosis of myocardial inflammatory cells was observed after the therapy with bone marrow cells. Transplanted bone marrow cells obtained from chagasic mice and from normal mice had similar effects in terms of mediating chagasic heart repair. These results show that bone marrow cell transplantation is effective for treatment of chronic chagasic myocarditis and indicate that autologous bone marrow transplant may be used as an efficient therapy for patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2004-01-27", "authors": ["Milena B PSoares", "Ricardo SLima", "Leonardo LRocha", "Christina MTakyia", "LainPontes-de-Carvalho", "Antonio C Camposde Carvalho", "RicardoRibeiro-dos-Santos"], "doi": "10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63134-3"}

Changes in the balance between matrix deposition and matrix degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can lead to cardiac fibrosis and dilation. In this review, we discuss the regulation of MMPs, their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) and collagen synthesis by inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and ROS activate mitogen-activated protein kinases and stress-responsive protein kinases in cardiac cells. In non-cardiac tissues, inflammatory cytokine activation of these kinases is redox sensitive, suggesting ROS may also be involved in cytokine signaling in the heart. Subsequent activation of transcription factors including AP-1, Ets, and nuclear factor kappa-B leads to increased transcription of MMPs. ROS also directly activate MMPs post-translationally. In addition, inflammatory cytokines and ROS lead to decreased TIMP levels and collagen synthesis. Work in animal models suggests that inhibition of inflammatory cytokine or ROS signaling leads to less myocardial remodeling. Further study of the signaling of regulation of the cardiac extracellular matrix may lead to new approaches for the treatment of myocardial remodeling and failure.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2004-01-24", "authors": ["Deborah ASiwik", "Wilson SColucci"], "doi": "10.1023/B:HREV.0000011393.40674.13"}

We recently found that cardiac chymase was activated significantly and survival rate markedly improved by treatment with chymase inhibitors after myocardial infarction (MI) in hamsters. However, the mechanisms for this effect have not been established. Because lethal arrhythmias are generally believed to contribute to sudden cardiac death, we assessed whether inhibition of cardiac chymase would provide an antiarrhythmic effect during the 8-h ischemic period after 2-[4-(5-fluoro-3-methylbenzo-[b]thiophen-2-yl)sulfonamide-3-methanesulfonylphenyl]oxazole-4-carboxylicacid (TY51184) (a specific chymase inhibitor, 1 mg/kg i.v.) treatment by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in dogs. Effects of candesartan (an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg i.v.) in this model were also assessed. Total Ang II-forming activity and chymase activity in the infarcted heart were increased significantly 8 h after LAD ligation. A time-dependent elevation of Ang II in plasma was also observed. A decrease in plasma Ang II levels after TY51184 treatment occurred concomitantly with suppression of cardiac chymase activity. LAD ligation resulted in a large number of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). TY51184 and candesartan treatments largely suppressed the appearance of VAs, and the efficacy of the two agents was similar. These findings demonstrate that chymase inhibition can provide an antiarrhythmic effect after MI, and the reduction of Ang II by TY51184 may be mainly responsible for this beneficial effect. An antiarrhythmic effect of chymase inhibitors may contribute to reductions in the mortality rate during the acute phase after MI.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2004-01-20", "authors": ["DenanJin", "ShinjiTakai", "MasatoSakaguchi", "YukikoOkamoto", "MichikoMuramatsu", "MizuoMiyazaki"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.103.061465"}
{"title": "A shift in myocardial substrate, improved endothelial function, and diminished sympathetic activity may contribute to the anti-anginal impact of very-low-fat diets.", "abstract": "A new category of anti-anginal drug - exemplified by ranolazine - is believed to work by partially inhibiting cardiac oxidation of fatty acids; oxidation of glucose requires less oxygen per mol of ATP generated, and thus is preferable to fat oxidation when oxygen availability is limiting in underperfused cardiac tissue. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that these drugs inhibit fat oxidation selectively in the heart; thus, chronic use of these drugs can be expected to increase body fat stores until the original rate of fat oxidation is restored by mass action - presumably negating the therapeutic benefit in angina, while exacerbating the manifold adverse effects of insulin resistance syndrome. The rational way to decrease cardiac metabolic reliance on fatty acids is to consume a very-low-fat quasi-vegan diet (i.e., 10% fat calories). Indeed, such diets are known to have a rapid and substantial therapeutic impact on anginal symptoms, while concurrently benefiting insulin sensitivity, markedly improving serum lipid profile, promoting leanness, and lessening coronary risk. A reduction in diurnal insulin secretion might also be achieved, which would be expected to decrease sympathetic activity. While reduced myocardial demand for oxygen doubtless contributes to the beneficial impact of such diets on angina, it is likely that improved cardiac perfusion consequent to improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation also plays a role in this regard. Supplemental carnitine, also beneficial in angina, appears to improve utilization of glucose in the ischemic myocardium by lowering elevated acetyl-coA levels and thereby disinhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase. Certain other nutraceuticals may aid control of angina by improving endothelial function. In the longer term, these measures have the potential to slow or reverse the progression of stenotic lesions that underlie most cases of angina. These safe and relatively inexpensive nutritional strategies for coping with angina deserve far more attention than orthodox medical practice has thus far accorded them.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2004-01-20", "authors": ["M FMcCarty"], "doi": "10.1016/s0306-9877(03)00232-9"}

However, under certain conditions, including clinically, its existence and importance remain unknown. We investigated the influence of acute tissue damage produced by continuous pacing with strong current (40-mA, 4-ms biphasic pulses with 4-Hz frequency for 5 min) on stimulus-generated VEPs and pacing thresholds. A fluorescent optical mapping technique was used to obtain stimulus-induced transmembrane potential distribution around a pacing electrode applied to the ventricular surface of a Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart (n = 5). Maps and pacing thresholds were recorded before and after tissue damage. Spatial extents of electroporation and cell uncoupling were assessed by propidium iodide (n = 2) and connexin43 (n = 3) antibody staining, respectively. On the basis of these data, passive and active three-dimensional bidomain models were built to determine VEP patterns and thresholds for different-sized areas of the damaged region. Electrophysiological results showed that acute tissue damage led to disappearance of the VEP with an associated significant increase in pacing thresholds. Damage was expressed in electroporation and cell uncoupling within an approximately 1.0-mm-diameter area around the tip of the electrode. According to computer simulations, cell uncoupling, rather than electroporation, might be the direct cause of VEP elimination and threshold increase, which was nonlinearly dependent on the size of the damaged region. Fiber rotation with depth did not substantially affect the numerical results.

The mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon of fetal programming are unknown. We hypothesize that adverse effects in utero and early life may influence the basal expression levels of certain genes such that they are re-set with long-term consequences for the organism. An excellent candidate mechanism for this re-setting process is DNA methylation, since post-natal methylation patterns are largely established in utero. We have sought to test this hypothesis by investigating the glucokinase gene (Gck) in rat offspring programmed using a maternal low protein diet model (MLP). Northern blot reveals that fasting levels of Gck expression are reduced after programming, although this distinction disappears after feeding. Bisulphite sequencing of the hepatic Gck promoter indicates a complete absence of methylation at the 12 CpG sites studied in controls and MLP animals. Non-expressing cardiac tissue also showed no DNA methylation in this region, whereas brain and all fetal tissues were fully methylated. These findings are not consistent with the hypothesis that programming results from differential methylation of Gck. However, it remains possible that programming may influence methylation patterns in Gck at a distance from the promoter, or in genes encoding factors that regulate basal Gck expression.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2004-01-07", "authors": ["IrinaBogdarina", "Helena CMurphy", "Shamus PBurns", "Adrian J LClark"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2003.08.017"}

Coxsackie B viruses (CBV) are considered to be the principal etiological agents of viral myocarditis and direct virus-induced damage to the heart tissue has been suggested to be the main mechanism underlying myocarditis in the murine model [Horwitz et al. 2000 Nat Med 6:693-697]. We demonstrate that 2-(3,4-dichloro-phenoxy)-5-nitrobenzonitrile (DNB), a compound that was earlier shown to exhibit broad-spectrum anti-picornavirus activity is also markedly active against CBV replication in primary human myocard fibroblast. To challenge the hypothesis of [Horwitz et al. 2000 Nat Med 6:693-697] we assessed whether DNB is able to prevent the development of CBV-induced myocarditis in a murine model. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of DNB at 250 mg/kg/day, at multiple injection sites (m.i.s.), for a period of seven consecutive days (starting at 1 day before infection) to 4-week old C3H-mice resulted in a (i) 62% reduction in the number of myocarditis foci as compared to the untreated control animals (p = 1.7 x 10(-10)) and (ii) a concomitant reduction in viral titers in the heart.

Rapid conduction through cardiac tissues depends on electrotonic transfer of the action potential between neighboring cells. To determine whether transjunctional voltages (Vj) elicited by an action potential can modulate conductance of Cx40 gap junctions, simulated myocardial action potentials were applied as voltage-clamp waveforms to Cx40 gap junctions expressed in mouse neuro2A (N2A) cells. Junctional currents resembled the action potential morphology but declined by >50% from peak to near-constant plateau values. Kinetics of Cx40 voltage gating were examined at peak voltages > or =100 mV, and decay time constants changed e-fold per 17.6 mV for Vj > +/-40 mV. Junctional conductance recovered during phase 3 repolarization and early diastole to initial values. These phasic changes in junctional conductance were due to rapid decay kinetics, increasing to tens of milliseconds at peak Vj of 130 mV, and the increase in the steady-state conductance curve as Vj returned toward 0 mV. Time-dependent conductance curves for Cx40 were modeled with one inactivation and two recovery Vj-dependent components. There was a temporal correlation between development of conduction delay or block and the inactivation phase of junctional conductance.

To formulate a self-consistent set of information on the densities, contents, or concentrations of chemical components and volumes of tissue spaces, we drew on information mostly on rats. From the data on densities, volumes, volume fractions, and mass fractions observed mainly on left ventricular myocardium, cytoplasm, and mitochondria and from morphometric data on cellular components and the vasculature, we constructed a matrix based on conservation laws for density, volume, and constituent composition.

We related the VW for reentry to effects on conduction velocity, action potential duration (APD), effective refractory period dispersion and restitution, and concordant and discordant APD alternans. We found the following: 1). reduced Na(+) current density and slowed recovery promoted postrepolarization refractoriness and enhanced concordant and discordant APD alternans, which increased the VW for reentry; 2). uniformly reduced cell coupling had little effect on cellular electrophysiological properties and the VW for reentry. However, randomly reduced cell coupling combined with decoupling promoted APD dispersion and alternans, which also increased the VW for reentry; 3). the combination of decreased Na(+) channel conductance, slowed Na(+) channel recovery, and cellular uncoupling synergistically increased the VW for reentry; and 4) the VW for reentry was greater when APD restitution slope was steep than when it was flat.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the levels of lipid peroxidation in myocardial tissue from subjects who had died from different causes are related to cardiac lesions of ischemic or traumatic aetiology. We studied 825 hypostasis-free samples taken from the myocardial tissue of 75 cadavers. In all cases, a survival period was known to have existed. Lipid peroxidation in myocardial tissue was estimated by the colorimetric determination of malondialdehyde. The highest levels of tissue peroxidation were observed in the group of subjects who died from myocardial infarction. We observed a statistically significant correlation between the extent of peroxidation and the presence of myocardial damage of ischemic or traumatic aetiology. In our study, lipid peroxidation was associated with myocardial injury. The data suggest that the extent of lipid peroxidation in myocardial tissue may be used as a reliable indicator of myocardial damage in support of data obtained by conventional microscopy.", "journal": "International journal of legal medicine", "date": "2003-11-19", "authors": ["PDom\u00e9nech", "LCarbonell", "M DP\u00e9rez C\u00e1rceles", "MFalc\u00f3n", "ALuna", "EOsuna"], "doi": "10.1007/s00414-003-0410-7"}
{"title": "Aminophylline therapy during endotoxemia in anesthetized spontaneously breathing rats.", "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as pentoxifylline and aminophylline, may reduce inflammatory cytokine-induced endothelial permeability. We tested the hypothesis that aminophylline treatment may ameliorate the pulmonary and extrapulmonary effects of endotoxemia in a rat model. In anesthetized rats, a tracheotomy was performed along with catheterization of a femoral vein and artery. Anesthesia, fluid balance, and normothermia were maintained throughout the 6-h experiment. A stable hemodynamic and gas-exchange baseline was established at which time the rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group I received aminophylline (1mg/kg) over 30 min followed by 0.5mg/kg/h. Group II received a single dose of endotoxin (4 mg/kg) while Group III received both aminophylline and endotoxin as described for Groups I and II, respectively. Gas-exchange profiles, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were determined every 2h. At hour 6, the rats were euthanized and lung, kidney, and heart tissue were removed for determination of water content. As our control group, we utilized data from our previously published study involving an identical surgical procedure with normal saline. Endotoxemia produced characteristic respiratory and hemodynamic signs of sepsis including hypotension, hyperventilation, tachycardia, and renal and pulmonary edema. Aminophylline treatment failed to prevent these endotoxemia-induced respiratory and hemodynamic manifestations of sepsis, but significantly improved the acid-base imbalance that developed during surgical procedures in saline-treated control rats. Further studies are warranted to determine potentially beneficial doses of aminophylline and resulting theophylline serum concentrations under such septic conditions.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2003-11-05", "authors": ["HarunFakioglu", "JavierGelvez", "DanTorbati", "Mark LGlover", "Jose LOlarte", "Maria TCamacho", "JackWolfsdorf"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2003.03.001"}
{"title": "Involvement of nitric oxide and prostaglandin pathways in the cardioprotective actions of bradykinin in rats with experimental myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Bradykinin is a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator in the coronary vascular bed. Endothelial mediators released by bradykinin include nitric oxide, prostacyclin and as yet unidentified endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factors. We wished to determine the involvement of nitric oxide and prostaglandin pathways in the cardioprotective actions mediated by bradykinin via the combined inhibition of ACE and aminopeptidase P (APP) in an in vivo rat model of acute ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (4h). Myocardial infarct size was measured by using the staining agent 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC). Lipid peroxide levels in serum and in heart tissue were estimated spectrophotometrically. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored at various intervals throughout the experiment. Infarct size reduction obtained with the combined inhibition of enalapril and apstatin, lisinopril and apstatin was blocked partially but significantly with the prior administration of L-NAME (Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) or aspirin, suggesting the involvement of both nitric oxide and prostaglandin pathways in the cardioprotective actions mediated by bradykinin.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2003-11-05", "authors": ["K KVeeravalli", "AAkula"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2003.07.010"}
{"title": "Coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis: differences in the immune response of C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice.", "abstract": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infections are the most frequent causes of human myocarditis, often resulting in chronic stages characterized by fibrosis and loss of function. This disease is called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Persistent virus in the myocardium may lead to chronic activation of fibroblasts, and subsequently, to fibrosis of the myocardium. Studies with immunodeficient mice have shown that certain defects of the immune system retard the rate at which virus is eliminated from the heart, thus leading to viral persistence. Therefore, we followed the immune response of two immunocompetent mouse strains (C57BL/6 and Balb/c) to CVB3 infection. These two strains have been reported to develop different immune responses to infections and we expected a similar reaction to viral infections as well. The two mouse strains recovered completely from CVB3 infection and expressed identical levels of cytokine mRNA in the heart. However, the virus in heart tissue decreased more slowly in Balb/c than in C57BL/6 mice. This was accompanied by a strong virus-specific IgG and weak IgM response in the C57BL/6 mice, in comparison to the Balb/c mice. We conclude, therefore, that viral-specific IgG is of importance for CVB3 elimination from infected hearts.", "journal": "Medical microbiology and immunology", "date": "2003-11-01", "authors": ["CarolaLeipner", "KatjaGr\u00fcn", "IlkaSchneider", "BrigitteGl\u00fcck", "Holger HSigusch", "AxelStelzner"], "doi": "10.1007/s00430-003-0199-5"}
{"title": "KvLQT1 modulates the distribution and biophysical properties of HERG. A novel alpha-subunit interaction between delayed rectifier currents.", "abstract": "Cardiac repolarization is under joint control of the slow (IKs) and rapid (IKr) delayed rectifier currents. Experimental and clinical evidence indicates important functional interactions between these components. We hypothesized that there might be more direct interactions between the KvLQT1 and HERG alpha-subunits of IKs and IKr and tested this notion with a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques. Co-expression of KvLQT1 with HERG in a mammalian expression system significantly accelerated HERG current deactivation at physiologically relevant potentials by increasing the contribution of the fast component (e.g. upon repolarization from +20 mV to -50 mV: from 20 +/- 3 to 32 +/- 5%, p < 0.05), making HERG current more like native IKr. In addition, HERG current density was approximately doubled (e.g. tail current after a step to +10 mV: 18 +/- 3 versus 39 +/- 7 pA/picofarad, p < 0.01) by co-expression with KvLQT1. KvLQT1 co-expression also increased the membrane immunolocalization of HERG by approximately 2-fold (p < 0.05). HERG and KvLQT1 co-immunolocalized in canine ventricular myocytes and co-immunoprecipitated in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as in native cardiac tissue, indicating physical interactions between HERG and KvLQT1 proteins in vitro and in vivo. Protein interaction assays also demonstrated binding of KvLQT1 (but not another K+ channel alpha-subunit, Kv3.4) to a C-terminal HERG glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Co-expression with HERG did not affect the membrane localization or ionic current properties of KvLQT1. This study shows that the alpha-subunit of IKs can interact with and modify the localization and current-carrying properties of the alpha-subunit of IKr, providing potentially novel insights into the molecular function of the delayed rectifier current system.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2003-10-31", "authors": ["Joachim REhrlich", "MarcPourrier", "ManjulaWeerapura", "NathalieEthier", "Aida MMarmabachi", "Terence EH\u00e9bert", "StanleyNattel"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M309087200"}
{"title": "Medium perfusion enables engineering of compact and contractile cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "We hypothesized that functional constructs with physiological cell densities can be engineered in vitro by mimicking convective-diffusive oxygen transport normally present in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we designed an in vitro culture system that maintains efficient oxygen supply to the cells at all times during cell seeding and construct cultivation and characterized in detail construct metabolism, structure, and function. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes suspended in Matrigel were cultured on collagen sponges at a high initial density (1.35 x 10(8) cells/cm(3)) for 7 days with interstitial flow of medium; constructs cultured in orbitally mixed dishes, neonatal rat ventricles, and freshly isolated cardiomyocytes served as controls. Constructs were assessed at timed intervals with respect to cell number, distribution, viability, metabolic activity, cell cycle, presence of contractile proteins (sarcomeric alpha-actin, troponin I, and tropomyosin), and contractile function in response to electrical stimulation [excitation threshold (ET), maximum capture rate (MCR), response to a gap junctional blocker]. Interstitial flow of culture medium through the central 5-mm-diameter x 1.5-mm-thick region resulted in a physiological density of viable and differentiated, aerobically metabolizing cells, whereas dish culture resulted in constructs with only a 100- to 200-microm-thick surface layer containing viable and differentiated but anaerobically metabolizing cells around an acellular interior. Perfusion resulted in significantly higher numbers of live cells, higher cell viability, and significantly more cells in the S phase compared with dish-grown constructs. In response to electrical stimulation, perfused constructs contracted synchronously, had lower ETs, and recovered their baseline function levels of ET and MCR after treatment with a gap junctional blocker; dish-grown constructs exhibited arrhythmic contractile patterns and failed to recover their baseline MCR levels.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Transmural left ventricular mechanics underlying torsional recoil during relaxation.", "abstract": "Early relaxation in the cardiac cycle is characterized by rapid torsional recoil of the left ventricular (LV) wall. To elucidate the contribution of the transmural arrangement of the myofiber to relaxation, we determined the time course of three-dimensional fiber-sheet strains in the anterior wall of five adult mongrel dogs in vivo during early relaxation with biplane cineangiography (125 Hz) of implanted transmural markers. Fiber-sheet strains were found from transmural fiber and sheet orientations directly measured in the heart tissue. The strain time course was determined during early relaxation in the epicardial, midwall, and endocardial layers referenced to the end-diastolic configuration. During early relaxation, significant circumferential stretch, wall thinning, and in-plane and transverse shear were observed (P < 0.05). We also observed significant stretch along myofibers in the epicardial layers and sheet shortening and shear in the endocardial layers (P < 0.01). Importantly, predominant epicardial stretch along the fiber direction and endocardial sheet shortening occurred during isovolumic relaxation (P < 0.05). We conclude that the LV mechanics during early relaxation involves substantial deformation of fiber and sheet structures with significant transmural heterogeneity. Predominant epicardial stretch along myofibers during isovolumic relaxation appears to drive global torsional recoil to aid early diastolic filling.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.
