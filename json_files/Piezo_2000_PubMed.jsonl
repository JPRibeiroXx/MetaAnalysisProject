It was found that the motional resistance variation (DeltaR(m)) increases and frequency shift (Deltaf) of PQC sensor decreases correspondingly during the mutagenic process of the bacteria. These parameters could reflect the variations of viscosity and density of culture system.

Real-time data is important for understanding the underlying chemical mechanisms associated with this reaction process. Here, the novel adaptation of existing piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) or quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technology was used to monitor, in real-time, the formation of a crosslink bond induced by formaldehyde between lysine and guanine. Previous results showed complexes of lysine and guanine constitute a major portion of the DNA-protein crosslinks formed. Thus, poly-lysine(5) and poly-deoxyguanosine(11) were used as a model system to develop this detection method. Poly-lysine(5) was immobilized on QCM electrode surfaces by covalent attachment through polyethylenimine (PEI). Immobilization was confirmed by the decrease in dry QCM frequency; data consistency suggested uniform coatings were produced. The QCM sensor was configured within a thermostatic environmental chamber. The system was calibrated and baseline responses to variations in the analyte solution matrix were identified. QCMs with immobilized poly-lysine(5) were placed in contact with formaldehyde and poly-deoxyguanosine(11), and crosslink formation was monitored in real-time. Crosslink formation was verified through evaluation of controls. Control assays indicated some of the frequency signal was as aresult of non-specific association. Further assays were conducted after saturation of non-specific binding. This real-time data represents a significant advancement in the state of knowledge of the crosslinking process and provides the experimental foundation for further QCM crosslink investigations.", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2008-10-31", "authors": ["R LBunde", "E JJarvi", "J JRosentreter"], "doi": "10.1016/s0039-9140(99)00265-9"}

Electrical processing with the Bauer cyclic poling method can produce individual films with well-defined remanent polarization up to 9 /spl mu/C/cm/sup 2/. These polymers provide an unusual opportunity to study the structure and physical properties of materials subjected to shock loading. The behavior of PVDF has been studied over a wide range of pressures using high-pressure shock loading and has yielded well-behaved, reproducible data up to 25 GPa in inert materials. The application of PVDF gauges for recording shock waves induced in polar materials such as Kel-F, PMMA, or in reactive materials is hampered by observations of anomalous responses due to shock-induced polarization or an electrical charge released inside a shock-compressed explosive. A solution using an appropriate electrical shielding has been identified and applied to PVDF for shock measurement studies of Kel-F, and for Hugoniot measurements of high explosives (PH). Furthermore, shock pressure profiles obtained with in situ PVDF gauges in porous HE (Formex) in a detonation regime have been achieved. Typical results of shock pressure profile versus time show a fast superpressure of a few nanoseconds followed by a pressure release down to a plateau level and then by a pressure decay.

{"title": "Piezoelectric stepper motor with direct coupling mechanism to achieve high efficiency and precise control of motion.", "abstract": "The paper describes a piezoelectric motor that combines the merits of piezoelectric materials, such as high power density generated at electromechanical resonance, and a precise control of displacement. In the motor, a standing shear wave is excited at the resonance in the piezoelectric tube, and it produces high-frequency torsional vibrations of the stator. The vibrations are converted into unidirectional rotation of a rotor by using a direct coupling mechanism between the stator and the rotor in which a clutch drives the rotor via locking it. The direct coupling makes it possible to transmit the whole power generated in the piezoelectric tube to the rotor, and thus achieve the high efficiency of the motor. It also allows combining two regimes of operation: continuous rotation and a stepwise motion within a 360 degrees interval with a high resolution of angular displacement.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2008-02-02", "authors": ["A EGlazounov", "SWang", "Q MZhang", "CKim"], "doi": "10.1109/58.852090"}

The class-D amplifier or inverter is composed of power MOSFETs, type IRFP460, in a full bridge configuration driven by IR2110 circuits in bootstrap mode. The specific nature of the problem comes from the fact that, at frequencies slightly different from a resonant frequency frn, the load is mostly capacitive.

{"title": "Nonlinear behavior in a piezoelectric resonator: a method of analysis.", "abstract": "Theories used for understanding nonlinear behavior of piezoelectric resonators are usually only valid for a given range of amplitudes. Thus, important discrepancies can sometimes be observed between theory and experiment. In this work, a simplified model of the resonator is assumed in order to extend the analysis of nonlinear behavior to any kind of nonlinear function, without a significant increase of mathematical complexity. Nevertheless, nonlinearities are considered to be weak enough to be taken as perturbations. An asymptotic method is used to obtain the first and second order perturbations of the response to an harmonic excitation applied to the system, and each one is separated into Fourier series. Nonlinearity is described by two functions-Phi, (S,D,S ,D ) and Psi (S,D,S ,D )-that must be added to the constitutive equations that give T and E as functions of S and D. These functions can be split into their symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts, which have different incidence over the perturbation terms. In order to simplify the problem, no mechanical excitation is considered, the electrical one is taken as strictly harmonic, and the current rather than the e.m.f. is taken as initial data. As an application example, this method is applied in order to find the second harmonic generation for a particular kind of nonlinearity.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2008-02-02", "authors": ["J EGarcia", "RPerez", "AAlbareda", "EMinguella"], "doi": "10.1109/58.852075"}

The CCS inversely scales with the cubic-tetragonal transition temperature (T(tr)). Electrostrictive coefficients exhibit an order of magnitude increase at 28 nm, which is attributed to the anharmonicity of the perovskite lattice.

The behavior of power devices working at resonance, in which high strains are involved, is explained. A theoretical model previously described is used to explain the motional impedance variation proportional to the square of the motional current. This impedance increase DeltaZ is independent of the frequency and explains: the nonlinear elasticity that produces the A-F effect, the nonlinear mechanical losses that increase greatly close to the resonance, and the hysteresis phenomenon produced with frequency sweeps. Different methods for measuring the mechanical nonlinear coefficients of piezoceramics with high signal excitation are presented. An experimental method is proposed to measure the mechanical loss tangent and the compliance variations as a function of the mean square strain in the piezoceramic. This consists in measuring the maximum admittance and the series resonance frequency for downward frequencies. At this jumping point, the phase angle remains zero whatever the amplitude of the excitation. Two main coefficients characterizing the material mechanical nonlinearity are deduced.

Classic criteria to determine tuning parameters in ultrasonic transducers do not perform very well in transient regime under the typical electrical conditions and peculiar output impedances of the required high-voltage pulsers. In most practical situations, the tuning values are manually adjusted in specific circuits for each NDE case, testing each channel of a multiprobe inspection system to find the best sensitivity. In this paper, the positive influences of certain selective damping and tuning networks on the time and frequency behaviors of NDE piezoelectric transceivers are analyzed in detail. Different waveforms and spectra of received ultrasonic signals are comparatively evaluated for different real tuning conditions, after passing through two ultrasonic processes linked in cascade: a transmitter of industrial type and a broad-band ultrasonic receiver. Piezoelectric transducer impedances, transduction transfer functions, and HV output spikes from a piezoelectrically loaded NDE pulser, are computed, to identify separately the influence of each stage. In order to improve amplitude and axial resolution in the received transient responses, relative contributions from emission and reception tuning networks are individually evaluated for a particular NDE two-stage piezoelectric channel.

Analysis of silver-stained gels showed that the noIR mutant had 189 proteins that were significantly altered in their levels (101 protein spots up- and 88 downregulated). Coomassie-stained preparative two-dimensional (2-D) gels or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes blotted from preparative gels showed that at least 52 of the altered proteins could be reproducibly detected and isolated from the noIR mutant. These 52 altered protein spots were classified into five groups based on an assessment of protein abundance by computer analysis and the effect of the presence or absence of luteolin addition to the growth medium. N-terminal microsequencing of 38 proteins revealed that the most striking feature of the consequence of the noIR mutation is the number and broad spectrum of cellular functions that are affected by the loss of the NoIR function. These include proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, heat shock and cold shock proteins, protein synthesis, a translation elongation factor, oxidative stress and cell growth and maintenance functions.

{"title": "Rationale for the choice of an aerosol delivery system.", "abstract": "The choice of an aerosol delivery system depends on numerous factors such as the drug itself, the characteristics of the aerosol generator, the patient and his or her disease, the physician, and the clinical setting, notably an emergency situation or not. Some rules always apply: an ultrasonic nebulizer should not be used to aerosolize a drug suspension; whenever possible, the same type of aerosol generator should be used for all inhaled medications received by a given patient; for outpatients, education is a major factor to ensure treatment efficacy. When the deposition of the aerosolized drug is aimed at the terminal respiratory units, nebulizers that generate micronic aerosols should be chosen. When the deposition of the aerosolized drug is aimed at the conducting airways, the metered dose inhaler (MDI) is the first choice. However, the MDI is often ill-used, notably in children and elderly people. Therefore, other inhalation devices have been developed: spacers, dry-powder inhalers, breath-actuated MDIs and, more recently, piezo-electric devices. They have been shown to increase lung deposition of drugs in poor coordinators but they all have limitations, which may affect their clinical efficacy. These limitations include the cumbersome dimensions of spacers, the dependency of lung deposition of dry powders on the inspiratory flow rate, the need for reformulation of breath-actuated or not MDIs with CFC-free gases. Nebulization of drugs should be considered only when no portable device is available for the considered drug, or in case of failure of other forms of aerosol administration.", "journal": "Journal of aerosol medicine : the official journal of the International Society for Aerosols in Medicine", "date": "2001-03-23", "authors": ["NRoche", "G JHuchon"], "doi": "10.1089/jam.2000.13.393"}

Piezoelectric quartz crystal sensors with novel humidity sensitive poly(ethyleneimine) coatings and Pt resistance thermometers were used to measure the relative humidity (RH) and temperature gradients across one of the paintings of the British artist, Stanley Spencer, housed in Sandham Memorial Chapel. The measurement period extended from December 1997 to September 1998. Each coated crystal was set in its own housing from which temperature and RH measuring circuits were connected via a cable to the computer. The 9 month monitoring period incorporated the range in seasons from winter through to autumn. Between December and February the RH at the back of the painting was found to be lower than that at the front. In March and April the reverse was true. Additionally, there were large spikes in the data in some of the months for both RH and temperature, probably caused by direct sunlight falling on the sensors. At the second site monitoring was performed for a shorter period, from December 1997 to early January 1998. It served, however, to show that abrupt changes can occur in the microclimate surrounding the painting. These fluctuations can with time lead to alterations to the paint surface and result eventually in cracking and damage to the art work.", "journal": "Journal of environmental monitoring : JEM", "date": "2001-03-17", "authors": ["MOdlyha", "G MFoster", "N SCohen", "CSitwell", "LBullock"], "doi": "10.1039/a909417b"}

They should, therefore, be suitable for use in experiments to calibrate structures so that acoustic emission source strengths can be determined. It has also been shown that measurements of the response of the transmitting transducer backing can be used to assess the coupling efficiency, and hence to remove concerns about inconsistent coupling affecting the calibration measurements. The results indicate that the variation of the backing response with coupling is due to a shift in the resonance frequencies of the transducer with the mechanical load impedance.

At concentrations greater than 10 ppb, the response of the 'non-imprinted' sensor to geosmin, another odorant often accompanying MIB, was significantly higher than the response of the 'imprinted' sensor. A number of other odorants were examined and, as in our previous work, the responses of the 'non-imprinted' sensors were found to be to greater than the responses of the 'imprinted' sensors.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["H SJi", "SMcNiven", "K HLee", "TSaito", "KIkebukuro", "IKarube"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(00)00097-x"}

Biotinylated 23-mer probes were immobilised on the streptavidin coated gold surface of a quartz crystal; streptavidin was covalently bound to the thiol/dextran modified gold surface. The hybridisation of the immobilised probes with a short sequence (23 mer) complementary, non-complementary and mismatched DNA was investigated: the device was able to distinguish the different synthetic oligonucleotides. Many cycles of measurements can be performed on the same crystal surface regenerating the single strand of DNA with 1 mM of HCl. The same hybridisation reaction was then performed using real samples of human DNA extracted from blood and amplified by PCR, following a standard procedure for genetic detection of the polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene. The procedure was able to distinguish the sequences present in the different samples, which differ only in one base: in this way it was possible distinguish between different groups of genotypes with apoE typing.

The protection of the silver electrode from undesirable oxidation was achieved by polystyrene or carboxy-poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-COOH) modification. In addition to serving as protection for the electrode, polymer films provided a substrate for antibody immobilization by either physical adsorption or covalent linkage. Polystyrene modification showed an additional advantage of improvement of surface smoothness. The atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the morphologies of polymer films obtained by dip or drop coating techniques. It was found that drop coating provided more significant improvement in surface smoothness than dip coating, and the resulting sensor surfaces were more suitable for in situ liquid phase assay. Although PVC-COOH-modified sensors were not suitable for liquid phase assay because of the high surface roughness, the covalent linkages (amide bonds) between antibodies and -COOH groups in the polymer film offered better sensor performance in ex situ assay in terms of a higher antibody binding capacity and better antigen detection sensitivity.", "journal": "The Analyst", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["XSu", "H TNg", "C CDai", "S JO'Shea", "S FLi"], "doi": "10.1039/b006895k"}
{"title": "Analysis and decomposition of signals obtained by thigh-fixed uni-axial accelerometry during normal walking.", "abstract": "The use of piezo-resistive uni-axial accelerometer signals in gait analysis is complicated by the fact that the measured signal is composed of different types of acceleration. The aim of the study is to obtain insight into the signal from a tangential accelerometer attached to the thigh during walking. Six subjects walk with three different speeds. Simultaneous measurements are performed with accelerometers, footswitches and an opto-electronic system. The components of the accelerometer signal are calculated from the opto-electronic system. A clear relationship is found between the measured and calculated accelerometer signals (range RMS: 0.76-3.69 m x s(-2), range rms: 0.22-0.61). The most pronounced feature is a high positive acceleration peak (> 10 m x s(-2)) at the end of the cycle. The gravitational acceleration during one cycle is characterised by a sinusoidal shape, whereas the inertial acceleration contains higher-frequency components (up to 20 Hz). During the major part of the gait cycle, the gravitational and inertial acceleration make opposing contributions to the signal As a result, the gravitational acceleration influences the amplitudes of the measured acceleration signal, the shape and peaks of which are mainly determined by the inertial acceleration. Because the gravitational and inertial accelerations differ in frequency components, the application for gait analysis remains feasible.", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["J BBussmann", "LDamen", "H JStam"], "doi": "10.1007/BF02344868"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric quartz crystal based label-free analysis for allergy disease.", "abstract": "This work presents a piezoelectric (Pz) quartz crystal based label-free quantification of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE in human sera for allergy testing. An evaluation of the different brands of crystals was first initiated with respect to variability in mass sensitivity, frequency measurement reliability and stability, and surface roughness. Thereafter, for total IgE quantification. a direct assay format was adopted. By means of thioctic acid (TA) and coupling reagents, anti-human IgE antibodies were immobilized on AT-cut Pz crystals (10 MHz). The modified crystals could detect serum IgE directly corresponding to a downward frequency shift. The results showed that silver-coated crystals as compared with their gold-coated counterparts provided approximately 1.5 times higher mass detection sensitivity for total IgE in the range of 5-300 IU/ml with a linear regression line, y = 1.8957 x + 1.5603, R2 = 0.995. For the detection of allergen-specific IgE, a sandwiched assay format was used. As the allergen-modified sensor surface captured various classes of associated antibodies (IgE, IgG, etc) and interfering serum proteins as well, the initial frequency shift downwards caused by sera sample incubation would not be proportional to specific IgE levels. Thus, following sample incubation, a second incubation step with secondary anti-human IgE was added to recognize IgE from other bound substances. The frequency shift after secondary antibody binding reflected the amount of allergen-specific IgE proportionally. Compared with 10 MHz crystals, the 20 MHz counterparts provided approximately four times higher mass detection sensitivity for allergen specific IgE in the range of 0.15-17.5 IU/ml with a linear regression line, y = 50.525 x + 107.777, R2 = 0.954.

The optimum temperature-time combinations for the highest immobilization yields were determined for both methods. Protein A binding was found to be 67.4+/-3.8% on the gold surface which then allowed an immobilization of 42.1+/-2.09% antibody. The degree of antibody immobilization via surface aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde (GA) on a precoated quartz crystal with polyethylenimine (PEI) was 31.6+/-0.3%. A piezoelectric probe was designed and used in dry assays to observe the frequency change due to addition of mass by the immobilization layers. The frequency changes recorded showed a better reproducibility and less added mass for the Protein A method. The frequency decrease due to microg of added antibodies was compared to frequency decrease calculated by the Sauerbrey equation. The experimental data was found to be only approximately 8% of theoretical data. The functionality of the immobilized antibodies with the Protein A method was tested with S. typhimurium in a wet chamber and the frequency decrease was compared to results of a similar system activated with PEI-GA immobilization. The frequency decreases with S. typhimurium concentration of approximately 1.5 x 10(9) CFU/ml were 50+/-2 Hz and 44+/-3 Hz for the Protein A method and PEI-GA method, respectively.

The technique involves the separation of the vestibular osseous flap from the palatal flap and the immediate positioning of the implant between the 2 cortical walls. The case report illustrates the ridge expansion and positioning of implants step by step in bone of quality 1 to 2 with only 2 to 3 mm of thickness that is maintained for its entire height. To obtain rapid healing, the expansion space that was created for the positioning of the implant was filled, following the concepts of tissue engineering, with bioactive glass synthetic bone graft material as an osteoconductive factor and autogenous platelet-rich plasma as an osteoinductive factor. The site was covered with a platelet-rich plasma membrane.

{"title": "[Detection of central auditory compensation in unilateral deafness with functional magnetic resonance tomography].", "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive method to detect focal brain activity at high spatial resolution. Acoustic stimulation induces an increase of regional cerebral blood flow in the primary auditory cortex. This entails an increased concentration of diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin in the capillaries and the venous system. The resulting decrease of the local magnetic susceptibility was detected as a signal increase in T2*-weighted images. The central auditory pathways predominantly cross to the contralateral hemisphere in normally hearing subjects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the primary auditory cortex after acoustic stimulation in unilateral deaf patients using fMRI.\nMagnetic resonance images were acquired on a 1.5 T Siemens Vision scanner. For fMRI, a single shot gradient recalled, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with decreasing excitation order was used, allowing the aquisition of 9 slices within 1.8 s. The 9 slices covered a slab of 3.6 cm in cranio-caudal extension in the region of the temporal lobes. For statistical processing of the raw image data the SPM96 software package was used. A p-value of p < 0.01 was applied to differentiate between activated and non-activated. The resulting functional activation maps were superimposed onto the EPI scan. The number of activated pixels was used to quantitate the cortical response upon acoustic stimulation. Stimulation consisted of a 1000-Hz sine tone (100 dB SPL at the distal end of the head phone, pulsed at 6 Hz) to which the patients were asked to listen passively. A piezoelectric loudspeaker was mounted on the subject table and connected to a plastic tube system leading to a combination of bilateral ear- and headphones. Auditory paradigms require disentangling experimental excitation from the scanner noise that approximates 90 dB. Headphones suppress noise by approximately 30 dB. To decrease the acoustic background-to-stimulation ratio and to keep background noise constant during stimulation and resting, we employed short scanning (1.8 s) and long resting periods (10.2 s; TR = 12 s). This acquisition mode allows sufficient recovery during off-periods and sufficient excitation during on-periods. 14 unilateral deaf patients were examined. The mean duration of deafness was 22.5 years.\nAcoustic stimulation of the deaf ear revealed only weak cortical activation which could be explained by sound transmission via bone conduction to the other ear. A significant increase of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent)-activation in the primary auditory cortex could be demonstrated in all patients after stimulation of the hearing ear. However, remarkable individual differences were noticed concerning the absolute number of activated pixels. The lateralization ratio was calculated by the number of activated pixels on the hearing side divided by the number of activated pixels on the deaf side. A mean lateralization ratio of 0.9 (Stdv +/- 0.6) was found. The mean lateralization ratio for patients with a right deaf ear (n = 8) and those with a left deaf ear (n = 5) was 1.1 (Stdv +/- 0.7) and 0.6 (Stdv +/- 0.3) respectively. However, the difference was not significant (Wilcoxon test: p = 0.08).\nCentral-auditory compensation by bilateral cortical activation was demonstrated in unilateral deaf patients. Moreover, a tendency towards a dominance of the left primary auditory cortex was found, although the difference between both hemispheres was not significant. The lateralization ratio in unilateral deaf patients is similar to findings after binaural stimulation in normally hearing subjects.", "journal": "Laryngo- rhino- otologie", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["KTschopp", "CSchillinger", "NSchmid", "MRausch", "DBilecen", "KScheffler"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2000-9136"}

The present work describes the validation that was performed on the piezo sensors alone, when mounted on a simplified structure, and when applied to a hip stem.Linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, and sensibility to shear and axial eccentric loads were tested, yielding satisfactory results. The repeatability on the same sensor was found to be good while reproducibility between sensors was lower. Thus, each sensor was calibrated separately with a second order relationship. Sensitivity to shear and eccentric loads was very low. The overall accuracy of the load cell (including non-linearity, and signal drift) was of the order of about 1%.A hip stem instrumented with four such sensors was successfully implanted in a composite femur, yielding meaningful readouts.Thus, this type of sensor can readily be used to assess the cement-prosthesis interface forces in cemented devices.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2001-02-13", "authors": ["LCristofolini", "AMarchetti", "ACappello", "MViceconti"], "doi": "10.1016/s1350-4533(00)00068-0"}

For the next two treatments at 2-week intervals, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 g EMLA or 10 g placebo cream and then crossed over to receive the other. The cream and occlusive dressing were left in place and immersed in water throughout the procedure. Verbal numeric pain score was assessed at 5 min after receiving the maximal tolerable intensity of shock wave and at the end of the procedure.

Pain score was evaluated 10 min into the procedure and at the end of the procedure.\nBoth parts of the study showed that patients who received either EMLA or placebo cream with dressing throughout the procedure experienced less pain and tolerated higher energy levels compared with the control. Patients who received only pre-EPSWL cutaneous anesthesia of EMLA and who received only the occlusive dressing did not have a reduction in pain score.\nEMLA and placebo creams under occlusive dressing reduced pain during EPSWL.

Eight adults [mean (SD) age, 21.5 (1.6) years] volunteered to perform an incremental test to exhaustion for the determination of peak power (Wpeak) and four, 15-min (or to exhaustion) rides at constant power outputs of 50%, 65%, 80%, and 95% Wpeak. Piezoelectric crystal contact sensors were placed on the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles to record the MMG signals. Bipolar surface electrode arrangements were placed on the VL and VM to record the EMG signals. Five-second samples of the MMG and EMG signals were recorded every 30 s at power outputs of 50%, 65%, and 80% Wpeak, and every 15 s at 95% Wpeak. The amplitudes of the selected portions of the signals were normalized to the first values recorded during the continuous rides, and regression analyses were used to determine whether the slope coefficients for the MMG and EMG versus time relationships were significantly (P < 0.05) different from zero. The results indicate that EMG amplitude increased (range of slope coefficients: 0.03-0.56) during the continuous rides for both muscles at all four power outputs (except the VM at 50% Wpeak), while MMG amplitude increased (slope coefficient at 95% Wpeak for VM = 0.19), decreased (range of slope coefficients for VL and VM at 50% and 65% Wpeak = -0.14 to -0.24), or remained unchanged (range of slope coefficients for VL and VM at 80% Wpeak and VL at 95% peak = -0.06 to 0.12) depending on the power output.

{"title": "Mechanomyograms recorded during evoked contractions of single motor units in the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle.", "abstract": "Acoustic phenomena accompanying contractions of single motor units (MUs) have previously received little attention. Therefore, in the present study, the mechanomyographic (MMG) signals during evoked contractions of single MUs have been recorded from the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the rat. A piezoelectric transducer immersed in a paraffin-oil pool was used for the measurement of these signals. Muscle fibre action potentials, tension and MMG were recorded in parallel during twitch (the weakest) and fused tetanic (the strongest) MU contractions. It was observed that the onset of the MMG signals was coincident with the beginning of the increase in tension for both the twitch and tetanus. Weaker MMG signals than those accompanying the beginning of the first phase of the fused tetanus were seen during the beginning of the relaxation after tetanic contraction. During contraction and relaxation, MMG signals were characterised by the reverse-direction of the first extreme phase, positive and negative, respectively. No MMG signals were observed when the tension was constant during the fused tetanus. The amplitude of MMG signals was correlated with both the tension increase and the velocity of tension increase during both the twitch and the fused tetanus. The strongest MUs (fast fatiguable) generated MMG signals of the highest amplitude. MMG signals were not detected for some of the weakest slow MUs (with tension increases of < or = 2 mN). These results indicate a strong correlation between the MMG and the change of tension. Therefore, we believe that MMG signals are generated by muscle deformation that occurs during the contraction of MU muscle fibres. We conclude that the number of active muscle fibres, their topography, and their localisation in relation to the muscle surface (which is variable for different types of MUs) influence these MMG phenomena.", "journal": "European journal of applied physiology", "date": "2001-01-04", "authors": ["EBichler"], "doi": "10.1007/s004210000261"}

The dynamic equations do not need to be formulated according to the analogy model for design and analysis. The proposed method also does not require computation schemes to solve the equations for obtaining the characteristics and the responses.

This paper examines the dependence of the phase offset on the diffracting conditions and on thin foil relaxation effects. It is shown that relaxation is negligible for the film thicknesses involved. Using a range of weakly diffracting conditions, the phase offset is measured as deltaV0/V0 = 0.042+/-0.012. Zone axis convergent beam electron diffraction patterns were taken and compared to simulations to determine the crystal polarity, showing the magnitude of the inner potential increased in the [0001] direction. By using dark-field displacement fringes to measure the InGaN layer thickness, and recent estimates of V0, the magnitude of the piezoelectric field is determined.

{"title": "When a \"wheeze\" is not a wheeze: acoustic analysis of breath sounds in infants.", "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of \"wheeze\" is very high in early childhood. However, it is clear that parents and clinicians frequently use the term \"wheeze\" for a range of audible respiratory noises. The commonest audible sounds originating from the lower airways in infancy are ruttles, which differ from classical wheeze in that the sound is much lower in pitch, with a continuous rattling quality and lacking any musical features. The aim of this study was to clearly differentiate wheeze and ruttles objectively using acoustic analysis. Lung sounds were recorded in 15 infants, seven with wheeze and eight with ruttles, using a small sensitive piezoelectric accelerometer, and information relating to the respiratory cycle was obtained using inductive plethysmography. The acoustic signals were analysed using a fast fourier transformation technique (Respiratory Acoustics Laboratory Environment programme). The acoustic properties of the two noises were shown to be quite distinct, the classical wheeze being characterized by a sinusoidal waveform with one or more distinct peaks in the power spectrum display; the ruttle is represented by an irregular nonsinusoidal waveform with diffuse peaks in the power spectrum and with increased sound intensity at a frequency of <600 Hz. It is important for clinicians and epidemiologists to recognize that there are distinct types of audible respiratory noise in early life with characteristic acoustic properties.", "journal": "The European respiratory journal", "date": "2000-12-06", "authors": ["H EElphick", "SRitson", "HRodgers", "M LEverard"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1399-3003.2000.16d04.x"}

Reducing the size of piezoelectric shock heads will only be possible if the pressure generated at the surface of each transducer can be increased so that the total pressure at the focus remains very high. We propose for the first time to increase the pressure without increasing the transducer voltage by using sandwiched transducers, which are a combination of several stacked transducers. When excited at appropriate time intervals, the pressure waves generated by each one reinforce when they reach the load. This new technique has been successfully tested. A pressure of 2.5 MPa was generated with two stacked, 5 mm-thick 1-3 piezocomposite transducers operating at an excitation voltage of 8 kV.

{"title": "In vivo force measurements on maxillary implants supporting a fixed prosthesis or an overdenture: a pilot study.", "abstract": "In this preliminary study, an attempt was made to measure in vivo forces simultaneously on 5 maxillary implants with different types of superstructure.\nForce measurements were carried out on 1 test patient with 5 ITI implants in the edentulous maxilla. A screw-retained fixed complete denture and an overdenture were fabricated for comparative measurements of forces. The overdenture could be mounted to 2 different types of bars. The measuring method was used with piezo-electric force transducers that were directly mounted onto the implants. This allowed for simultaneous measurements of forces in 3 dimensions, ie, in axial and transverse directions. Static and functional forces such as maximum biting (clenching), biting on a bite plate, and chewing food were registered. All measurements were repeated in the same way 2 years later.\nThe registered forces exhibited similar force patterns with both types of superstructure and both types of bars for overdenture connection. The force magnitudes were significantly different for the 3 dimensions (P<.05) with highest forces along the implant axis. On the posterior implants, force magnitudes were significantly higher (P<.05) than on the anterior implants in all 3 dimensions. On the anterior implants, under some test conditions, the transverse force components reached up to 100% of the axial force or even exceeded it during the chewing of food. During maximum biting, no upward force (tensile force) was found on any implant with the fixed complete denture, but upward force was found on one anterior implant with the overdenture. When chewing food, small force magnitudes in upward directions were regularly found with both superstructures. The force patterns between the first and second registrations showed similar trends, and no obvious differences were found.\nFrom these results it was concluded that similar patterns of force transmission onto the implants are observed with a fixed complete denture and an overdenture connected to maxillary implants.

The efficiency of ICSI in bovine is very limited because of the necessity for additional oocyte activation before or after the ICSI procedure. In this study, we compared the effects of seven different protocols on activation and fertilization rates of bovine oocytes after ICSI and on their subsequent development under in vitro conditions. The protocols include 1) different chemical activation of oocytes, 2) pretreated or nonpretreated sperm, and 3) conventional or Piezo-driven injection techniques. In all three groups, ICSI, sham-injected, and noninjected, the highest activation rates were obtained after treatment of oocytes with ionomycin followed by 6-dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP). Using this treatment for oocyte activation, 59% of oocytes were activated and 31% of oocytes were fertilized using dithiothreitol (DTT) pretreated spermatozoa and Piezo-driven injection. Using the protocols with the same oocyte activation or activation with calcium ionophore (Ca-I) and cycloheximide (CHX), nonpretreated sperm, and conventional injection technique, early cleavage rate (79.6% and 77.6%, respectively) were significantly (P <0.01) higher when compared with all other protocols. The latter protocol resulted in 8% blastocyst and 90% of the obtained blastocysts were found to be diploid.

Patch clamp techniques were used in the whole-cell mode to evaluate the effect of N(2)O and Xe on GABA-induced currents. A piezo-driven \"liquid filament switch\" was used for fast application. Both N(2)O (100%, 29.2 mM) and Xe (100%, 3.9 mM) reversibly increased GABA-induced currents through the alpha(1)ss(2)gamma(2L) and the alpha(1)beta(2) GABA(A)R channels. The potentiating effect of N(2)O or Xe on peak currents was prominent at small GABA concentrations (10(-7) to 10(-5) M). The addition of N(2)O or Xe increased the efficacy of GABA (10(-7) to 10(-3) M). Both N(2)O and Xe significantly decreased the risetime((10%-90%)) of the currents elicited by small GABA concentrations. At the concentrations used, neither N(2)O nor Xe had an intrinsic effect.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Mass-Sensing Devices as Biosensors-An Alternative to Optical Biosensors?", "abstract": "In the early days of electronic communication-as a result of the limited number of quartz resonators available-frequency adjustment was accomplished by a pencil mark depositing a foreign mass layer on the crystal. In 1959, Sauerbrey showed that the shift in resonance frequency of thickness-shear-mode resonators is proportional to the deposited mass. This was the starting point for the development of a new generation of piezoelectric mass-sensitive devices. However, it was the development of new powerful oscillator circuits that were capable of operating thickness shear mode resonators in fluids that enabled this technique to be introduced into bioanalytic applications. In the last decade adsorption of biomolecules on functionalized surfaces turned in to one of the paramount applications of piezoelectric transducers. These applications include the study of the interaction of DNA and RNA with complementary strands, specific recognition of protein ligands by immobilized receptors, the detection of virus capsids, bacteria, mammalian cells, and last but not least the development of complete immunosensors. Piezoelectric transducers allow a label-free detection of molecules; they are more than mere mass sensors since the sensor response is also influenced by interfacial phenomena, viscoelastic properties of the adhered biomaterial, surface charges of adsorbed molecules, and surface roughness. These new insights have recently been used to investigate the adhesion of cells, liposomes, and proteins onto surfaces, thus allowing the determination of the morphological changes of cells as a response to pharmacological substances and changes in the water content of biopolymers without employing labor-intense techniques. However, the future will show whether the quartz-crystal microbalance will assert itself against established label-free sensor devices such as surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and interferometry.", "journal": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "date": "2000-11-28", "authors": ["AJanshoff", "HJGalla", "CSteinem"], "doi": "10.1002/1521-3773(20001117)39:22<4004::aid-anie4004>3.0.co;2-2"}

Two examples are presented: (1) simulated balance study, and (2) different pressure patterns during walking. Accurate corrections can only be made for forces distributed over a small area. Errors are expected to be overcompensated if there are only a few pressure peaks separated by large distances.

The temperature of the superheated liquid is increased very slowly from room temperature to the temperature at which the liquid nucleates to boiling.

The character and extent of the heart failure that occurs in MLP(-/-) mice were investigated using echocardiography and in vivo pressure-volume (P-V) loop measurements. P-V loop data were obtained with a new method for mice (sonomicrometry) using two pairs of orthogonal piezoelectric crystals implanted in the endocardial wall. Sonomicrometry revealed right-shifted P-V loops in MLP(-/-) mice, depressed systolic contractility, and additional evidence of heart failure. Cellular changes in MLP(-/-) mice were examined in isolated single cells using patch-clamp and confocal Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]) imaging techniques. This cellular investigation revealed unchanged Ca(2+) currents and Ca(2+) spark characteristics but decreased intracellular [Ca(2+)] transients and contractile responses and a defect in excitation-contraction coupling. Normal cellular and whole heart function was restored in MLP(-/-) mice that express a cardiac-targeted transgene, which blocks the function of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) kinase-1 (betaARK1). These data suggest that, despite the persistent stimulus to develop heart failure in MLP(-/-) mice (i.e., loss of the structural protein MLP), downregulation and desensitization of the beta-ARs may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis. Furthermore, this work suggests that the inhibition of betaARK1 action may prove an effective therapy for heart failure.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "NFkappaB translocation in human microvessel endothelial cells using a four-compartment subcellular protein redistribution assay.", "abstract": "Protein distribution profiles may be used to characterize both physiological and pathophysiological cellular changes, but rigorous biochemical assays for measuring such movements are lacking. This paper reports on a protein redistribution assay that combines reversible metal chelate-based total protein detection with a four-fraction subcellular detergent fractionation procedure. TNF-alpha stimulated cultured human omental microvessel endothelial cells are fractionated into cytosol, membrane/organelle, nuclear (envelope and associated), and cytoskeletal/DNA compartments. Protein fractions are separated electrophoretically and electroblotted or slot-blotted onto PVDF membranes without electrophoretic separation. A key feature is that total protein is measured and analyzed directly on the resultant PVDF membrane, using a Ferrozine/ferrous metal-chelate stain, without the added step of a prior solution-phase protein assay. As a result, factors that may adversely affect NFkappaB quantification, such as saturation of the solid-support membrane, are rigorously evaluated and controlled. Following removal of the Ferrozine/ferrous total protein stain, NFkappaB distribution is determined via standard immunodetection procedures. This assay reveals a new level of complexity regarding NFkappaB distribution and translocation. NFkappaB is shown to translocate from the cytosol to the membrane/organelle and cytoskeletal/DNA fractions, whereas trace levels of NFkappaB are observed in the nuclear (envelope and associated) fraction. Dose-curve analysis reveals that the response is initiated at 10 U/ml of TNF-alpha, plateaus at approximately 1000 U/ml, and remains essentially constant up to 2000 U/ml. Time-course analysis demonstrates a measurable response as early as 5 min and a peak response at approximately 30 min, after which the distribution begins to return to baseline.

The control objective is to minimize the displacement at an arbitrary output location. The LRR model developed is verified against one produced by using the finite-element method.

Because of the prior lack of availability of validated antibodies to SQE, positive controls for the assay were made by immunization with formulations containing SQE to create monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that reacted with SQE. Among eight immunogens tested, only two induced detectable murine antibodies to SQE: liposomes containing dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, 71% SQE, and lipid A [L(71% SQE+LA)], and, to a much lesser extent, an oil-in-water emulsion containing SQE, Tween 80, Span 85, and lipid A. In each case, lipid A served as an adjuvant, but neither SQE alone, SQE mixed with lipid A, liposomes containing 43% SQE and lipid A, nor several other emulsions containing both SQE and lipid A, induced antibodies that reacted with SQE. Monoclonal antibodies produced after immunizing mice with [L(71% SQE+LA)] served as positive controls for developing the ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies were produced that either recognized SQE alone but did not recognize squalane (SQA, the hydrogenated form of SQE), or that recognized both SQE and SQA. As found previously with other liposomal lipid antigens, liposomes containing lipid A also induced antibodies that reacted with the liposomal phospholipids. However, mAbs were also identified that reacted with SQE on PVDF membranes, but did not recognize either SQA or liposomal phospholipid. The polyclonal antiserum produced by immunizing mice with [L(71% SQE+LA)] therefore contained a mixed population of antibody specificities and, as expected, the ELISA of polyclonal antiserum with PVDF membranes detected antibodies both to SQE and SQA.

Next, it was determined that blocking with fish gelatin and binding in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl could reduce nonspecific binding 10,000-fold and result in enrichment ratios greater than 500-fold with antigen concentrations as low as 1 ng/mm(2). When optimized conditions were applied to phage antibody libraries, panels of monoclonal phage antibodies were generated against the proteins ErbB2 and bovine serum albumin electroblotted from SDS-PAGE gels onto nitrocellulose. Antibodies were obtained with as little as 10 to 1 ng of antigen, depending on whether the libraries displayed single or multiple copies of antibody per phage. The antibodies worked as reagents in both ELISA and Western blotting.", "journal": "Analytical biochemistry", "date": "2000-10-20", "authors": ["BLiu", "J DMarks"], "doi": "10.1006/abio.2000.4788"}

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are strongly hydrophilic and negatively charged molecules that do not bind well to either polystyrene surfaces or hydrophobic blotting membranes. Hydrophobic membranes were derivatized with cationic detergents to become hydrophilic and positively charged. The ability of the polyvinylidene fluoride and nitrocellulose membranes to retain GAGs increased up to 12.8 microg per spot in the dot blot assay when the membrane was treated with a cationic detergent. Immobilized GAGs were stained with alcian blue, and the staining intensity was quantitated by scanning and densitometry. The derivatized membranes were used for solid-phase extraction of GAGs in blood plasma, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid. The detection sensitivity was equal for different types of GAGs but there was a slight negative interference from fibrinogen in blood plasma. The immobilized GAGs could also be released from the membrane using a nonionic detergent at high ionic strength.

{"title": "A review of the technical aspects of drug nebulization.", "abstract": "Nebulizers are widely used for the inhalation of drug solutions in a variety of respiratory diseases. The efficacy of nebulizer therapy is influenced by a great number of factors, including the design of the device and the characteristics of the drug solution. Incorrect cleaning, maintenance and disinfection procedures may change the nebulizer performance in time, whereas patient factors can influence the lung deposition of the generated aerosol. In this review the technical aspects of nebulization of drug solutions will be discussed. Two main parameters are generally used to evaluate the performance of nebulizers: the droplet size distribution of the aerosol and the drug output rate. The droplet size distribution and the drug output rate are basically determined by the design and user conditions of the nebulizer. A higher gas flow of the compressor in a jet nebulizer or a higher vibration frequency of the piezo electric crystal in an ultrasonic nebulizer, decreases the droplet size. The choice of the type of nebulizer for nebulization of a certain drug solution may initially be based on laboratory evaluation. The major part of the mass or volume distribution should preferably correspond with aerodynamic particle diameters in the range of 1 to 5 micrometer. The intended drug output must be realized within a reasonable nebulization time (less than 30 min). From the drug output only a minor fraction will be deposited in the lung. The relation between in vitro and in vivo deposition is only partly understood and to date it has not been possible to predict drug delivery only from in vitro studies on nebulizers. Therefore, studies in patients should be performed before a drug solution for nebulization can be recommended for clinical practice. The mechanical properties of nebulizers are likely to change during use. An average utilization time of nebulizers is not available. Therefore, the performance of nebulizers should be checked periodically. Patient compliance in nebulizer therapy is relatively low. This is partly due to the fact that, at present, drug solutions for nebulizers cannot be administered efficiently within a short period of time. More efficient systems should be developed. If possible, nebulizers should be substituted to more efficient systems, e.g. dry powder inhalers or metered dose inhalers.", "journal": "Pharmacy world & science : PWS", "date": "2000-10-12", "authors": ["P PLe Brun", "A Hde Boer", "H GHeijerman", "H WFrijlink"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1008786600530"}

Bovine oocytes were cultured in vitro for 24 h and those with a polar body were selected for ICSI. Frozen-thawed semen from the three species were treated with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h and spermatozoa were killed by storing them in a -20 degrees C refrigerator before use. ICSI was performed using a Piezo system. Three experiments were designed. In experiment 1, a higher (p < 0.05) male pronuclear formation rate was found in the oocytes injected with ram (52.6%) or bull (53.4%) spermatozoa than with minke whale spermatozoa (39.1%). In experiment 2, sperm head decondensation was detected at 2 h after ICSI in the oocytes injected with a spermatozoon of each species. Male pronuclei were first observed at 4 h in the oocytes injected with ram or bull spermatozoa and at 6 h in oocytes injected with minke whale spermatozoa. The mean diameters of male pronuclei derived from both whale and bull spermatozoa were larger than those from ram spermatozoa (30.4 microm and 28.3 microm vs 22.4 microm, p < 0.005). The mean diameter of female pronuclei in the oocytes injected with whale spermatozoa was also larger than with ram spermatozoa (29.3 microm vs 24.7 microm, p < 0.05). The development of male and female pronuclei was synchronous. In experiment 3, ethanol-activated oocytes injected with a spermatozoon from any of the three species achieved significantly higher (p < 0.05-0.001) cleavage rates than control oocytes. Blastocyst formation was only observed when bull spermatozoa were used.

{"title": "Surface characterization and platelet adhesion studies on fluorocarbons prepared by plasma-induced graft polymerization.", "abstract": "It is believed that the interactions between the biological environment and biomaterial surface are the key factors influencing its biocompatibility. Therefore, plasma processing, which can vary the surface properties without altering the bulk properties, has been considered as one of the important techniques for improving a materials' biocompatibility. In this investigation, plasma-induced grafting polymerization of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), instead of direct plasma polymerization, was attempted with an aim to improve the substrate blood compatibility. Contact angle measurement indicated both fluorocarbon-grafted Pdyethylenes (PEs) are hydrophobic. Due to the additional fluorine and chlorine atoms on the CTFE chain, the PCTFE-grafted PE exhibited a higher hydrophobicity than the PVDF-grafted one. ESCA analysis has revealed that these two plasma-induced fluorocarbon deposits contain almost no CFx (x > 2) binding on the surface layer, indicating the grafting polymerization mainly follows the free radical mechanism instead of the molecule-highly-fragmented reaction steps commonly seen in the direct plasma polymerization treatment. In addition, ATR-FTIR has shown the surface chemical configuration of these PVDF- and PCTFE-grafted PEs to be very similar to those of the bulk samples of PVDF and PCTFE. The surface roughness decreased after oxygen plasma treatment and was further reduced by VDF and CTFE grafting polymerization. In vitro platelet adhesion testing indicated these two fluorocarbon grafted PEs are less platelet-activating than the nontreated PE control and oxygen plasma activated one.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials science.

An S-shaped response behavior was observed for Deltaf(0), and simultaneously inverse S-shaped responses were found for DeltaR(1) and DeltaL(1). The ratio of DeltaR(1) to Deltaf(0) or DeltaL(1) coincided well with that calculated from Martin's equations reflecting the solution density-viscosity effect, suggesting that the continuing change in liquid loading onto the PQC surface causes significant variation in Deltaf(0), DeltaR(1), and DeltaL(1). Bacterial growth equations were derived from the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of starch, which fit well with the experimental responses of Deltaf(0), DeltaR(1), and DeltaL(1). Kinetic parameters of bacterial growth, including the asymptote (A), the maximum specific growth rate (microm), and the lag time (lambda), were obtained and were in good agreement with those obtained from the pour plate count method.

{"title": "In vivo experiments in the cat with an implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducer.", "abstract": "We have recently developed an implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducer that is suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. The transducer does not transmit sound but conducts micromechanical vibrations to the cochlea. In ten cat ears we investigated the efficiency of the implantable transducer with respect to the direct transfer of vibrations within the audible frequency range via the ossicles to the cochlea or directly into the vestibule. The acoustically evoked brainstem potential (ABR) threshold was determined prior to implantation, and the middle ear was then opened and the piezoelectric transducer coupled to the ossicles or to the perilymph. Acoustically evoked brainstem potentials were recorded following stimulation at the umbo, long process of the incus, stapes head, stapes foot plate, and in the vestibulum. Comparisons of the acoustically and mechanically evoked thresholds revealed a good correlation of the two stimulation levels. An electrical transducer voltage of 1 V(RMS) produced equivalent sound pressure levels (SPL) of 100-128 dB at the tympanic membrane. To assess the hearing we compared stimulus-dependent latencies of the early potentials (peaks P1-P5) and thresholds. This evaluation was based on four ears with normal hearing in which the piezoelectric transducer was coupled to the long process of the incus. The mean values of the latencies and their scattering range correlated extremely well in the two stimulation modes. They were nearly identical when the equivalent SPL of 100 dB was assigned to the maximally applied electrical level of 0 dB. These in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate that the characteristics of the transducer warrant its development further from the prototype stage to become a component of an implantable hearing device for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.", "journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2000-09-19", "authors": ["P KPlinkert", "J WBaumann", "TLenarz", "SKeiner", "HLeysieffer", "H PZenner"], "doi": "10.1007/s004059900209"}

The change in the polarization is proportional to internal stresses due to film-substrate misfit, whereas the linear electrical and electromechanical responses to external field do not depend on the misfit and are determined by the film constraint. The theoretical results are successfully applied to PbZr 0.2Ti 0.8O (3) films on (001) LaAlO (3) substrate which exhibit a considerable increase in the saturation polarization due to epitaxial stresses.

Purified recombinant human, mouse, rat, pig, and chicken leptin proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electro-blotted onto PVDF membranes.

The peptide antiserum was found to be highly specific for leptin which exhibited an estimated molecular weight of about 16 kDa for all species analyzed. The sensitivity of the Western blot assay was not sufficient to permit the direct detection of leptin in chicken serum or plasma. However, with this assay we were able to detect native leptin protein in an enriched fraction prepared from chicken plasma using a combination of gel filtration and ion exchange column chromatography. Slot blots indicated a potential application of the immunostaining technique for quantitative analysis of leptin protein. Finally, the peptide antiserum was successfully employed to localize leptin protein by immunohistochemical staining of thin sections prepared from adipose (chicken and pig) and liver (chicken) tissue samples.

Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae) larvae weighing 1-12 mg could be detected in small pots of wheat in the laboratory by taking moderate precautions to eliminate background noise. Insect sounds could be distinguished from background noises by differences in frequency and temporal patterns, but insects of similarly sized species could not be distinguished easily from each other. Insect activity was highly variable among individuals and species, although D. abbreviatus grubs tended to be more active than those of O. sulcatus. Tests were done to compare acoustically predicted infestations with the contents of soil samples taken at recording sites. Under laboratory or ideal field conditions, active insects within approximately 30 cm were identified with nearly 100% reliability.

High IOP, which can be a sign of glaucoma, can lead to degeneration of the retina and can cause blindness. In this study we developed a resonator sensor for IOP measurement based on an oscillator consisting of a piezoelectric element made of lead zirconate titanate, a flat contact piece of nylon and a feedback circuit. The aim of this study was to evaluate the new sensor's ability to determine lOP in an in vitro pig-eye model. Six eyes from four pigs were removed and fixed in agar. They were then pressurized by a saline column (10-35 cm H2O) through a cannula inserted into the vitreous chamber. The IOP was measured with the resonator sensor applied to cornea. An Alcon applanation pneumatonometer and a standard Viggo-Spectramed pressure sensor connected to the saline column were used as references. The IOP as measured with the resonator sensor correlated well with the pressure elicited by the saline column for individual eyes (r = 0.96-0.99, n = 60) and for all eyes (r = 0.92, n = 360). The correlation between the resonance sensor and the pneumatonometer was r = 0.92 (n = 360). The pneumatonometer also showed a good correlation with the saline column (r = 0.98, n = 360).

Frequency response functions of CM1 and CM2 were used to demonstrate the functional similarity between the implanted P-MEI and the normal ossicular chain. The coherence functions between the voices and CM1 and between CM1 and CM2 were evaluated to characterize speech transmission of the P-MEI in vivo. Ten rabbit ears were used in this study. Pure tones, six Chinese vowels, and six Chinese characters were the acoustic stimuli. The CMs elicited by a list of bisyllabic words were tape-recorded and then recognized by subjects with normal hearing.\nUsing pure tones at the same intensity of 90 dB SPL, frequency response functions of the CMs between the two states (the intact ear with normal hearing and ears with a P-MEI device at the medium volume) were calculated showing great resemblance in shape. Compared with that at 1 kHz, gain factors were 10 and 20 dB, respectively, at higher frequencies. The correlation and spectral analyses of the vocalizations, CM1 and CM2, demonstrated that the harmonics of CM1 were approximately identical as those of the voices between 0.5 and 5.0 kHz with coherence functions of about 0.7 to approximately 1 at the formants' frequencies, whereas the harmonics of CM2 between 0.5 and 2.5 kHz were enhanced with the coherences near to unity at the formants' frequencies, and others <0.5 kHz and >2.5 kHz were attenuated.

If this luminous efficiency could be transferred to white LEDs, power consumption would be dramatically reduced, with great economic and ecological consequences. But the luminous efficiency of existing white LEDs is still very low, owing to the presence of electrostatic fields within the active layers. These fields are generated by the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization along the [0001] axis of hexagonal group-III nitrides--the commonly used materials for light generation. Unfortunately, as this crystallographic orientation corresponds to the natural growth direction of these materials deposited on currently available substrates.

Rev. 20:197-272). To determine if differences in the cross-bridge cycle and/or distribution of the cross-bridge states could contribute to differences in the mechanical properties of smooth muscle, we determined force and stiffness as a function of frequency in Triton-permeabilized strips of rabbit portal vein (phasic) and aorta (tonic). Permeabilized muscle strips were mounted between a piezoelectric length driver and a piezoresistive force transducer. Muscle length was oscillated from 1 to 100 Hz, and the stiffness was determined as a function of frequency from the resulting force response. During calcium activation (pCa 4, 5 mM MgATP), force and stiffness increased to steady-state levels consistent with the attachment of actively cycling cross-bridges. In smooth muscle, because the cross-bridge states involved in force production have yet to be elucidated, the effects of elevation of inorganic phosphate (P(i)) and MgADP on steady-state force and stiffness were examined. When portal vein strips were transferred from activating solution (pCa 4, 5 mM MgATP) to activating solution with 12 mM P(i), force and stiffness decreased proportionally, suggesting that cross-bridge attachment is associated with P(i) release. For the aorta, elevating P(i) decreased force more than stiffness, suggesting the existence of an attached, low-force actin-myosin-ADP- P(i) state. When portal vein strips were transferred from activating solution (pCa 4, 5 mM MgATP) to activating solution with 5 mM MgADP, force remained relatively constant, while stiffness decreased approximately 50%. For the aorta, elevating MgADP decreased force and stiffness proportionally, suggesting for tonic smooth muscle that a significant portion of force production is associated with ADP release. These data suggest that in the portal vein, force is produced either concurrently with or after P(i) release but before MgADP release, whereas in aorta, MgADP release is associated with a portion of the cross-bridge powerstroke.

Twenty-two healthy subjects (37+/-7 yr) were asked to repeat three consecutive times the deglutition of three types of bolus: dry (saliva only), liquid (10 ml water) and solid (1 cm(3) biscuit). The whole recording session was repeated 4+/-3 days apart. Two parameters were considered: amplitude and duration of the deglutition. Both intra- and inter-sessions repeatability were assessed by the standard error of measurement. The amplitude measurements were often found to be clipped at 100 mV, making duration the only parameter suitable for analysis. The duration was homogenous for the three types of bolus and no trend effect was found either intra- or inter-sessions. Inter-sessions repeatability was significantly lower than the intra-session one (P<0.05). As a practical implication, a change in duration >/=1 s (=65% of the observed mean value) between two separate measurements is required in order to be 95% confident that it is not due to chance alone. We conclude that the observed limitations in the measurements provided by the CLA system, in conjunction with its intrinsic characteristic of providing only an uncalibrated measurement of global laryngeal activity, seriously question the possibility of using the CLA system either as a diagnostic tool or as a substitute of the gold standard method (videofluorography).", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2000-08-30", "authors": ["RMaestri", "CPistarini", "GBertotti", "AFerri", "CGuarnaschelli", "G DPinna"], "doi": "10.1016/s1350-4533(00)00029-1"}
{"title": "[Detection and isolation of bacteria of Legionella species from the water environment].", "abstract": "The aim of this work was to find method of isolation of bacteria of genus Legionella from water environment. Were used reference strains such as: L. pneumophila ATCC 33152, strains of bacteria contaminated water samples: E. coli ATCC 35218, S. aureus ATCC 12600, Str. faecalis ATCC 29212 and P. aeruginosa--strain from own collection, isolated from water environment. Because of the slow growth of bacteria of genus Legionella and dangers of contamination the preliminary treatment of examined water samples should be done. Water samples inoculated with standard strains of bacteria before inoculation by plated membrane filtration or plated directly methods were undergone acid pretreatment (acid buffer pH 2.2) and heat pretreatment (temp. 50 degrees C). The contact time used for studies was respectively 10,20,30 min. and 30, 45 min. The best time used for acid treatment procedure was 10 min., for heat treatment procedure was 30 min. Such adjust parameters of preliminary treatment of water samples should reduce enough growth of non-Legionella organisms and not to influence the growth of searched Legionella strains. The researches showed that the most successful of isolation is membrane filtration method, where filters are directly placed on the culture medium. In studies buffered charcoal yeast extract agar medium with cysteine, activated charcoal and selective supplements were used. The growth of bacteria on the cellulose, polycarbonate and polyvinylidene fluoride filters were compared. The best results were achieved with cellulose and polyvinylidene fluoride filters. Growth of colonies of bacteria on the filters should be examined between 3rd and 7th days of incubation period at 37 degrees C and 90% relative humidity. Legionella forming colonies growing on membrane filters are shining with smooth edge, cream or white.

This method is based on a combined experimental/analytical approach, where small polymer samples (6 mm x 3 mm x 110 microm) are encapsulated in a soft silicone rubber and an electric field is applied across their thickness (3-direction). Strains are measured optically along three perpendicular directions using a laser Doppler vibrometer, and the experimental measurements are used in a Rayleigh-Ritz energy minimization procedure implemented symbolically in MATHCAD, which yields the absolute piezoelectric coefficients d(3ii).

The technique utilizes an in-house-developed piezoelectric flow-through droplet dispenser for precise reagent supply and an ultrasonic levitator for contactless sample handling. A few-cell study was performed with living primary adipocytes. Droplets (500 nL) containing 3-15 individual cells were acoustically levitated. The addition of beta-adrenergic agonists into the levitated droplet using the droplet dispenser stimulated adipocyte lipolysis, leading to free fatty acid release and a consequent pH decrease of the surrounding buffer. The addition of insulin antagonized lipolysis and hence also the decrease in pH. The changes in pH, i.e., the cell response in the droplet, were followed using a pH-dependent fluorophore continuously monitored by fluorescence imaging detection. An image analysis computer program was employed to calculate the droplet intensities.

The long axis of these stones (211 (55%) lumbar, 38 (10%) iliac and 136 (35%) pelvic stones) ranged from 5 to 21 mm (mean = 8.2 mm). The initial shock wave frequency was 4/s. Lumbar stones were treated in the dorsal supine position under diaz-analgesia and pelvic stones were treated in the ventral supine position without systematic sedation. The influence of wave frequency (1 versus 4/s) on the level of sedation and therapeutic performances was studied on 146 patients with lumbar (n = 92) or pelvic stones (n = 54). The results were evaluated after only one ESWL session and were analysed statistically by Student's test and Fisher test.\nThe overall complete success rate was 74%. Iliac stones were characterized by significantly (p < 0.05) lower (61%) performances. The results were inversely proportional to the size of the stones, as the complete success rate was only 25% for stones > 12 mm. For lumbar stones, a lower frequency allowed a very significant reduction (p < 0.0001) of the level of sedation required without affecting the performance. For pelvic stones, a low frequency significantly (p < 0.05) limited the efficacy of ESWL, especially for stones > 8 mm (27% of complete successes).\nIn situ piezoelectric ESWL allows effective management of most ureteric stones with of long axis between 5 and 10 mm. In the context of outpatient treatment, however, this approach requires modulation of the shock wave frequency according to the site of the stone. Another therapeutic approach, particularly endoscopy, should be considered for very large stones.", "journal": "Progres en urologie : journal de l'Association francaise d'urologie et de la Societe francaise d'urologie", "date": "2000-08-22", "authors": ["MRobert", "PLanfrey", "JGuiter", "HNavratil"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Glucose transporter expression in human skeletal muscle fibers.", "abstract": "The present study was initiated to investigate GLUT-1 through -5 expression in developing and mature human skeletal muscle. To bypass the problems inherent in techniques using tissue homogenates, we applied an immunocytochemical approach, employing the sensitive enhanced tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technique to detect the localization of glucose transporter expression in human skeletal muscle. We found expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and GLUT-4 in developing human muscle fibers showing a distinct expression pattern. 1) GLUT-1 is expressed in human skeletal muscle cells during gestation, but its expression is markedly reduced around birth and is further reduced to undetectable levels within the first year of life; 2) GLUT-3 protein expression appears at 18 wk of gestation and disappears after birth; and 3) GLUT-4 protein is diffusely expressed in muscle cells throughout gestation, whereas after birth, the characteristic subcellular localization is as seen in adult muscle fibers. Our results show that GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and GLUT-4 seem to be of importance during muscle fiber growth and development. GLUT-5 protein was undetectable in fetal and adult skeletal muscle fibers. In adult muscle fibers, only GLUT-4 was expressed at significant levels. GLUT-1 immunoreactivity was below the detection limit in muscle fibers, indicating that this glucose transporter is of minor importance for muscle glucose supply. Thus we hypothesize that GLUT-4 also mediates basal glucose transport in muscle fibers, possibly through constant exposure to tonal contraction and basal insulin levels.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The explanation of this effect is based on considering SAWs as coupled Rayleigh and Bleustein-Gulyaev modes. A general procedure of approximate decoupling of the modes is suggested for piezoelectric crystals of arbitrary anisotropy. The effect under study takes place when the phase velocity of uncoupled sagittally polarized Rayleigh waves is intermediate between the phase velocities of uncoupled shear-horizontal Bleustein Gulyaev waves at the free and metallized surfaces. In this case, the metallization of the surface by an infinitely thin layer may cause a crossover of the velocity curves of the uncoupled waves. The presence of the mode coupling results in splitting of the curves with transition from one uncoupled branch to the other. This transition is responsible for the increase in SAW velocity, which appears to be greater than its common decrease produced by electrical shorting of the substrate surface.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2000-08-19", "authors": ["V GMozhaev", "MWeihnacht"], "doi": "10.1016/s0041-624x(00)00019-6"}

The time courses of responses of piezoelectric and electrochemical impedance parameters were simultaneously obtained during the adsorption processes of the two forms of peptide, oxidized and reduced glutathione. It was found that the frequency curve due to the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) adsorption exhibited a character of a sum of two exponential functions. For reduced glutathione (GSH), the frequency adsorption curve could be expressed by a first-order reaction kinetic model and the corresponding kinetic parameters at different amounts of GSH were obtained. The heterogeneous charge-transfer rate constants of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide before and after the peptide adsorption were determined by CV and EIS methods, respectively. According to the simple equivalent electric network of the electrochemical interface, the electrochemical impedance parameters were also obtained.

Protein from tissue sections containing the locus coeruleus (LC) was directly transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Immunoreactive TH on PVDF membranes was identified with optimized concentrations of TH antibody followed by application of [125I]labeled secondary antibody. Quantities of TH on autoradiograms were estimated by comparing optical densities of transferred immunoblots to a calibrated standard curve produced with purified recombinant TH dotted onto the same PVDF membranes. Amounts of TH-immunoreactivity in the LC were proportional to the thickness of tissue sections up to 15 micrometer. However, the amounts of total protein, as measured by Ponceau S staining, were linearly related to section thicknesses up to 30 micrometer. Comparisons of quantities of immunoreactive TH in the LC using this method to amounts determined using traditional Western blotting, in which LC tissue was punched from adjacent sections from the same subject, showed a positive correlation (r(2)=0.99, P<0.01). Using the transfer immunoblot method, an uneven distribution of TH protein was observed along the rostrocaudal axis of the human LC (P<0.01).

This digitally filtered signal is used to modulate the pulse rate of electrical stimulation. The pulse rate is varied between 50 and 250 Hz via a sigmoidal lookup table relating pulse rate to angular velocity; the steady-state rate is 150 Hz.

The activity of the immobilized alpha-amylase is monitored by a technique based on bulk acoustic-wave (BAW) sensor. The frequency shift of BAW sensor can reflect the degree of hydrolysis of starch by the immobilized alpha-amylase. It is appropriate for the immobilized alpha-amylase to hydrolyze the soluble starch under pH 7.0 condition, which is similar to that of the free alpha-amylase. Kinetic parameters (the Michaelis constant, K(m), and the maximum initial rate V(max)) of the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch by the immobilized alpha-amylase are estimated by using a linear method of Lineweaver-Burk plot. K(m)=12.7mgml(-1) and V(max)=15.9Hzmin(-1). And the experimental results show that the immobilized alpha-amylase entrapped by the UV-curing coating retains adequate enzymatic activity and can be reused more than 50 times under certain experimental conditions.", "journal": "Biochemical engineering journal", "date": "2000-07-26", "authors": ["DHe", "YCai", "WWei", "LNie", "SYao"], "doi": "10.1016/s1369-703x(00)00068-1"}

Preparation and characterization of the materials.", "abstract": "The development of ideal antithrombogenic polymers, a major problem in biomaterials sciences, is a primary objective in the fields of cardiovascular prostheses, artificial hearts, and other devices. To decrease their thrombogenicity, which remains the major obstacle, we have developed polymeric materials endowed with a specific affinity for antithrombin III (ATIII) and thus able, like heparin, to catalyze the inhibition of thrombin by ATIII. Sulfonate and sulfonamide groups are introduced onto phenyl rings belonging to styrene residues, which are radiation grafted (using swift heavy ion and gamma radiation) onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) and also onto poly(vinylidene fluoride/hexafluoropropylene) [P(VDF-HFP)]. In contrast to gamma radiation, which leads to a homogeneous modification, the advantage of swift heavy ion grafting is that only small regions are modified; thus, the surface may present hydrophilic (corresponding to the modified areas) and hydrophobic microdomains (corresponding to the unmodified areas) of different sizes, depending on the absorbed dose and grafting yield. Surface topography and composition are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Sulfur, sodium, fluorine, and carbon are determined by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDXA). The amount of fluorine decreases as polystyrene (PS) is grafted, whatever the kind of radiation and polymer. When the polymers are functionalized, the amount of fluorine also decreases while sodium and sulfur appear. Functionalization seems to increase the roughness of the surface, and its area.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research", "date": "2000-07-25", "authors": ["M CPort\u00e9-Durrieu", "CAymes-Chodur", "NBetz", "CBaquey"], "doi": "10.1002/1097-4636(200010)52:1<119::aid-jbm15>3.0.co;2-q"}

The minigel format, 8 x 10 cm, was found sufficiently resolving and reproducible to study complex biological samples while considerably increasing throughput and lowering costs compared to larger gel formats. Consequently, we used the minigel format to rapidly screen a large number of samples, of which only the most relevant were then analyzed by optimized, preparative two-dimensional gels. The accurate localization and relative quantification of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was performed using a nonradioactive triple labeling method. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, proteins were stained with Sypro Ruby to verify the separation quality and to localize the general region of interest for immunostaining. The membranes were subsequently blocked with polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and probed with the relevant antibodies for visualization of the phosphorylated proteins by chemiluminescence. Finally, membranes were stained with colloidal gold to obtain a pattern reminiscent of the silver staining of a polyacrylamide gel.

In the present study, proteomic profiles of these three LCLs were analyzed comparatively at the early and the late passages of cell culture, and a protein spot was found which most significantly decreased with the immortalization in two LCLs. The expression of the protein in the third LCL was suppressed at 17 population doubling level (PDL), already suggesting that part of the immortalization process had been initiated before 17 PDL.

In this study, recombinant protein for native peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (N-PPIase) and double-labeled (13C- and 15N-) protein (DL-PPIase) appeared on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) electropherograms as two bands for N-PPIase and four bands for DL-PPIase. Since the N-terminal amino acid residues of all bands were the same, we characterized these bands using the peptide mapping method and amino acid composition analysis. Peptide mapping of the proteins seemed to be almost identical but they could not reflect the whole amino acid sequences of the protein. The bands on the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, electroblotted after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), were hydrolyzed and their amino acid composition was analyzed using a highly sensitive 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) amino acid analysis and compared with the cDNA sequences for proteins. The matching score (sigma(T%-E%)2) for similarity of proteins was calculated by summation of the square difference between the theoretical (T%) and the experimental (E%) amino acid composition of the recombinant protein. The amino acid composition of all bands of both proteins showed more than 93% of the theoretical values. The major molecular weights of both proteins were 16812 and 17694 by electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry. However, the purified proteins also contained minor compounds with Mr of 3721 for N-PPIase and 5285 for DL-PPIase.

We examined the effects of CGRP on spontaneous and stimulus-evoked discharge patterns in an in vitro preparation of the lateral line organ of Xenopus laevis. Discharge patterns were determined by sinusoidally displacing the cupula with a glass micropipette driven with a piezoelectric device while recording afferent fiber activity. All afferent fibers had characteristic frequencies of 16-32 Hz. Responses synchronized to cupular displacements as small as 20 nm. CGRP suppressed responses of the lateral line organ to displacement while increasing spontaneous discharge rate. In the presence of CGRP, stimulus-response curves were shifted 10 dB toward higher displacement levels. The suppression of stimulus-evoked responses suggests a function for CGRP as an efferent neurotransmitter that is similar to that of cholinergic efferent transmission in other hair cell organs. The 10 dB shift toward larger displacements makes it comparable in magnitude with the effects of electrical stimulation of efferents in the mammalian cochlea.

These two peptides show a high binding capability for trimethylamine. To further enhance the sensitivity of the polypeptides towards the target compound, the polarity and the degree of docking were changed by a site-specific modification technique. The orp61 sequence was modified by substituting two amino acids in the binding pocket resulting in 33% increase in sensitivity towards trimethylamine and reduced noises from other non-target chemicals.

However, rotating deep-seated interstitial applicators and controlling their shooting direction presents major technical problems. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of constructing a cylindrical array with a plane rotating beam for ablating esophageal tumors by interstitial hyperthermia. The feasibility of such an array has been initially evaluated using a plane array (which is easier to make from a technical point of view). This array was made with a new piezoelectric material because its mechanical properties make it ideal for the construction of a cylindrical array in the future.

The pneumatic system replaces the conventional springs situated between tamping pins and upper part of the tamping head. Via a feedback switch valve, the air pressure inside the pneumatic chamber can be regulated. This provides a potential mechanism for feedback control of capsule fill weight during continuous capsule filling. It was found that the use of the pneumatic tamping head is limited to the control of fill weight during tamping. Major adjustments of fill weight at the set-up stage of the machine should be made by alteration of the tamping pin and powder bed height settings.

If the force plate can be considered a rigid body, six linear accelerometers can measure all linear and angular accelerations of the instrument in 3-D space. However, by using nine accelerometers in a proper layout, the force and moment generated by the movement of the plate can be quantified in a way that eliminates the errors due to the time integration of the accelerations. By doing so, no temporal limits are imposed to the compensation. A one degree of freedom numerical model was implemented to evaluate the importance of main error sources in the estimation of inertial forces using accelerometers with different technical characteristics. The inertial compensation of the force plate along one axis was tested, and the performances of a piezoelectric accelerometer and a capacitive accelerometer were compared. With the proposed inertially compensated force plate, accelerations up to 5 g's in amplitude and frequencies from 0 to 100 Hz can be compensated by means of capacitive accelerometers.

{"title": "Micromachined ultrasound transducers with improved coupling factors from a CMOS compatible process.", "abstract": "For medical high frequency acoustic imaging purposes the reduction in size of a single transducer element for one-dimensional and even more for two-dimensional arrays is more and more limited by fabrication and cabling technology. In the fields of industrial distance measurement and simple object recognition low cost phased arrays are lacking. Both problems can be solved with micromachined ultrasound transducers (MUTs). A single transducer is made of a large number of microscopic elements. Because of the array structure of these transducers, groups of elements can be built up and used as a phased array. By integrating parts of the sensor electronics on chip, the cabling effort for arrays can be reduced markedly. In contrast to standard ultrasonic technology, which is based on massive thickness resonators, vibrating membranes are the radiating elements of the MUTs. New micromachining technologies have emerged, allowing a highly reproducible fabrication of electrostatically driven membranes with gap heights below 500 nm. A microelectronic BiCMOS process was extended for surface micromechanics (T. Scheiter et al., Proceedings 11th European Conference on Solid-State Transducers, Warsaw, Vol. 3, 1997, pp. 1595-1598). Additional process steps were included for the realization of the membranes which form sealed cavities with the underlying substrate. Membrane and substrate are the opposite electrodes of a capacitive transducer. The transducers can be integrated monolithically on one chip together with the driving, preamplifying and multiplexing circuitry, thus reducing parasitic capacities and noise level significantly. Owing to their low mass the transducers are very well matched to fluid loads, resulting in a very high bandwidth of 50-100% (C. Eccardt et al., Proceedings Ultrasonics Symposium, San Antonio, Vol. 2, 1996, pp. 959-962; P.C. Eccardt et al., Proceedings of the 1997 Ultrasonics Symposium, Toronto, Vol. 2, 1997, pp. 1609-1618). In the following it is shown how the BiCMOS process has been modified to meet the demands for ultrasound generation and reception. Bias and driving voltages have been reduced down to the 10 V range.

The measurements exhibit sound pressures and bandwidths that are at least comparable with those of conventional piezoelectric transducer arrays.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2000-06-01", "authors": ["PCEccardt", "KNiederer"], "doi": "10.1016/s0041-624x(99)00085-2"}

Since it is of primary importance to be able to control the generated modes, a suitable modeling technique of this kind of system has been tested on different cases of practical interest.

{"title": "Sensitivity of ultrasonic hydrophone probes below 1 MHz.", "abstract": "Frequency responses of different PVDF polymer hydrophone probes, including membrane and needle designs, were measured and are presented in terms of end-of-cable voltage sensitivity versus frequency over a wide, 4.5 octave bandwidth ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 MHz. The probes are seldom, if at all, characterized in this frequency range due to the difficulties associated with a lack of adequate and readily implementable calibration techniques. To this end, a technique, which uses a combination of swept frequency chirp and reciprocity, so that both the relative and absolute plots of sensitivity versus frequency can be obtained, was developed and tested. Salient features of the technique including the design of a 6 octave auxiliary acoustic source are described. The experimental data indicate that a majority of the PVDF membrane hydrophones exhibit a relatively uniform (to within +/- 2 dB) response. While, in general, this is not the case for commercially available needle hydrophone probes, it is evidenced that a careful attention to the PVDF probe design results in frequency characteristics fairly close to those achievable with a membrane design. The overall uncertainty of the calibration technique was estimated to be better than +/- 1.5 dB in the considered frequency range. The results of this work are important to implement procedures for adequate determination of the Mechanical Index (MI) of ultrasound imaging devices.

{"title": "A matrix model of the axle vibration of a piezoelectric motor.", "abstract": "In this work, a matrix model of the axle vibration of a piezoelectric motor is proposed. The stator of this motor is composed of a thin piezoelectric membrane and a steel axle fitted at the center of the membrane. The rotor consists of a cylinder-shaped permanent magnet, pressed in contact with the other end of the axle by means of the magnetic forces. A travelling wave is excited in the membrane by using four electrodes and four, properly delayed, driving signals. The rotating flexural displacement of the membrane produces a wide precessional motion of the axle. In this way, a continuous slipping takes place between the axle and the rotor, and therefore, a torque is transmitted to the rotor. In this paper, the precessional motion of the axle is modeled as the composition of two transverse vibrations belonging to two perpendicular planes passing through the axle. The axle, vibrating in its transverse mode, is modeled as a two-port system: the input is the bending moment supplied by the membrane, and the output is the transverse force at the terminal end of the axle. With this model, we have computed the trasmission transfer function as a function of frequency, and the transversal displacement along the axle at its resonance frequency.

In the present paper, we first describe the state of the art of linear piezoelectric motors. The motors are characterized with respect to their no-load velocity, maximum thrust force, efficiency and other technical properties. In the second part, we present a new motor, which is judged to be capable of surpassing the characteristics of other piezoelectric motors because of its unique design which allows the piezoelectric drive elements to be pre-stressed in the direction of their polarization. The piezoelectric elements convert energy using the longitudinal d33 effect which allows an improved reliability, large vibration amplitudes and excellent piezoelectric coupling.

The combination of all these data together provides a more exhaustive, detailed and accurate view of foot loading during activities than traditional measurement systems alone do. A prototype system is presented that integrates a pressure platform, a force platform and a 3D anatomical tracking system to acquire combined information about foot function and loading. A stereophotogrammetric system and an anatomically based protocol for foot segment kinematics is included in a previously devised piezo-dynamometric system that combines pressure and force measurements. Experimental validation tests are carried out to check for both spatial and time synchronisation. Misalignment of the three systems is found to be within 6.0, 5.0 and 1.5 mm for the stereophotogrammetric system, force platform and pressure platform, respectively.

Measurements are also taken on five healthy volunteers during level walking to verify the feasibility of the overall experimental protocol.

Two human tumor cell lines and one normal human cell line were loaded into polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fibers at two or more cell concentrations and grown in mice for 3-10 days. The data demonstrate the importance of characterizing the initial loading density of various cell lines in the evaluation of compounds.

When the growth cones and lamillipodia from the cell soma were mechanically stimulated, inward currents were recorded at the holding potential of -60mV. Filopodia were most sensitive to mechanical stimulation. However, when neurites or soma of dorsal root ganglion cells were stimulated in the same way, electrical responses were hardly recorded. Two types of currents varying in time-course were observed: fast type of 100-200ms and slow type of several seconds in duration. When the membrane potential was held at around 0mV, both types of currents were almost abolished or even reversed, and the reversal potential was estimated to be about -2. 2mV. Replacement of extracellular sodium by tetraethylammonium did not significantly change the reversal potential. In the low-chloride solution ([Cl(-)](o)=11.7mM), the reversal potential was about +60mV, as expected from the Nernst equation for chloride. These inward currents were almost completely inhibited by extracellular application of chloride channel blocker, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (100microM).

{"title": "Rigid piston approximation for computing the transfer function and angular response of a fiber-optic hydrophone.", "abstract": "The transfer function of a fiber-optic hydrophone (FOH) is computed for various fiber core radii. The hydrophone is modeled as a rigid disk, with plane waves impinging at normal or oblique incidence. The total sound field is written as the sum of the incident field and the field diffracted from the hydrophone. The diffracted field is approximated by the field generated by a vibrating planar piston in an infinite rigid baffle. For normal incidence and a pointlike fiber core, an analytical solution is presented. For finite fiber core radii, and for oblique incidence, the transfer functions are computed numerically. The calculated transfer functions exhibit an oscillatory frequency dependency that is most pronounced for small fiber cores. The solution for a core radius of 2.5 microm can be very well approximated by the analytical solution for a pointlike core at frequencies of up to 30 MHz. The results for normal incidence can be directly employed to deconvolute ultrasonic pressure signals measured with an FOH. From the transfer functions for oblique incidence, the angular response of the hydrophone is calculated. The angular response obtained here differs significantly from the model commonly used for piezoelectric hydrophones. The effective hydrophone radius derived from the angular response shows a strong frequency dependency.

Sixteen adult subjects performed maximal CON leg extensions on a calibrated Cybex 6000 dynamometer at leg angular velocities of 60 and 300 degrees.s-1. MMG was detected by a piezoelectric crystal contact sensor placed over the mid-portion of the vastus lateralis muscle. The results indicated a significant (p < 0.05) velocity-related decrease in peak torque (PT) and increase in MMG amplitude from 60 to 300 degrees.s-1. There was, however, no velocity-related change (p > 0.05) in MMG MPF. These findings did not support our hypothesis that increases across velocity in MMG amplitude were due to decreases in muscle stiffness as a result of a shift in the contribution of slow and fast-twitch muscle fibers to PT production. Future research should examine the potential influence of actin-myosin cycling rate as well as limb movement on the MPF and amplitude of the MMG signal.", "journal": "Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology", "date": "2000-04-27", "authors": ["K TEbersole", "T JHoush", "J PWeir", "G OJohnson", "T KEvetovich", "D BSmith"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Towards an objective quantitative assessment of daily functioning in migraine: a feasibility study.", "abstract": "Migraine is a chronic disabling disorder, with migraine episodes significantly reducing quality of life and leading to impaired functioning (physically, socially, emotionally) both at home and at work. We explored whether ambulatory accelerometry can be used as an objective method to quantify the behavioral aspects of migraine-related disability. Four body mounted uni-axial piezo-resistive accelerometers were used to quantify the time spent in different body postures (lying, sitting, standing), physical activities (walking, cycling) and a general index of body motility during eight migraine attacks and subsequent recovery periods of six patients in their habitual environment. The migraine attacks and recovery periods could be monitored after about 1 h, which was the time required for the investigator to travel to the patient and for the sensors to be attached. In order to quantify the influence of a migraine episode on daily activities, we also performed measurements during a headache-free baseline period of the same patients. Overall, the procedures functioned well, indicating that ambulatory accelerometry measurements before, during and after a migraine attack are feasible to perform. Furthermore, our quantitative data revealed that migraine always influenced behavior by reducing overall body motility and that, dependent upon the severity of the attack, the effectiveness of acute treatment and the time of day, the time spent in various body positions, dynamic activities, and the number of postural transitions were affected. This feasibility study showed that ambulatory accelerometry can provide the objective behavioral effect parameters for the evaluation of migraine and its treatment on daily functioning in the habitual environment of migraine patients.", "journal": "Pain", "date": "2000-04-26", "authors": ["J HTulen", "D LStronks", "J BBussmann", "LPepplinkhuizen", "JPasschier"], "doi": "10.1016/s0304-3959(00)00235-9"}

However, the detailed analysis of TA muscle is important to understand the physiology of swallowing. We investigated 14 healthy adult subjects. Activation of the TA laryngeal adductor muscle was compared with the mechanically measured laryngeal up-down movement and with the onset of excitation of laryngeal elevators, such as submental (SM) muscles, during swallowing. The laryngeal adductor of TA and laryngeal elevators of SM muscles were electromyographically (integrated/rectified) recorded. The vertical laryngeal movements during swallowing were recorded using a piezoelectric sensor. The EMG behavior of the TA muscle revealed three different activities during swallowing. The basic activity was stable; it almost started with the upward movement of larynx and after the SM-EMG onset. A fore-burst was recorded just before the upward movement of the larynx and a late-burst appeared just after the downward movement. The fore-burst was proposed to be related with oral-laryngeal reflexes, and the late-burst could be a rebound activity after a short expiration of swallowing, while the basic activity is accepted to be a part of activity of central-pattern generator of swallowing program.", "journal": "Journal of clinical gastroenterology", "date": "2000-04-25", "authors": ["CErtekin", "MCelik", "YSe\u00e7il", "STarlaci", "NKiylo\u011flu", "IAydo\u011fdu"], "doi": "10.1097/00004836-200004000-00014"}

The PEAA generator consists of eight individual transducers of 200-kHz resonant frequency. At a discharge voltage of 15 kV, the PEAA generator produces a shock wave with a peak positive pressure of 8.2 MPa, a positive half cycle duration of 2.9 micros, and a -6-dB beam width of 5 mm. The trigger of the PEAA generator was controlled via fiberoptic link with reference to the spark discharge of the EH generator. Hence, the PEAA-generated shock wave could be used to interact with cavitation bubbles induced by the EH source at various stages of their oscillation. The duration of bubble oscillation during SWL was monitored by a 2.25-MHz focused hydrophone, and this information was used to control the release timing of the PEAA generator. Stone fragmentation tests in vitro were carried out, and demonstrated that stone comminution could be significantly enhanced when the shock wave-bubble interaction occurred during the collapsing phase of the bubbles. A maximum increment of 60% to 80% in stone fragmentation was achieved when the PEAA-generated shock wave arrives near the collapse of the bubbles. Under these conditions, much intensified collapse of the bubbles near the surface of the stone, with strong secondary shock-wave emission and increased stress concentration at the impact site of the solid boundary, was observed using high-speed shadowgraph and photoelastic imaging.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2000-04-25", "authors": ["XXi", "PZhong"], "doi": "10.1016/s0301-5629(99)00124-6"}

It is based on the selective binding of dye molecules to proteins in acidic solution and produces bluish violet colored bands. It is a simple and rapid procedure, involving only staining and rinsing steps that occur within 7 min. The sensitivity of this method is 5-10 ng of protein on nitrocellulose (NC) and 10-20 ng on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), which is tenfold better than that of the commonly used Ponceau S staining. Moreover, the staining is reversible for subsequent immunostaining, without impairing immunoreactivity. To remove the dye from the developed bands, changes in pH and hydrophobicity of the solvent are required. Due to its sensitivity, rapidity, simplicity, and low cost, this stain may be more practical than other dye-based stains or metal-based stains for routine laboratory purposes.", "journal": "Electrophoresis", "date": "2000-04-18", "authors": ["H YHong", "G SYoo", "J KChoi"], "doi": "10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(20000301)21:5<841::AID-ELPS841>3.0.CO;2-4"}

The MALDI target plate was placed on a computer controlled high-resolution x-y stage, on to which the column effluent was deposited as discrete spots, which thereby facilitated tracing of the chromatographic separation. The entire target plate was sprayed with a homogeneous layer of alpha-cyano-4-cinnamic acid mixed with nitrocellulose by using an air-brush. Hence the tedious manual handling of a micropipetter applying matrix solution on top of each fraction collected spot was avoided. The pre-made target plates were stable for at least 3 weeks if kept in darkness at room temperature, which easily allowed re-analysis of dispensed sample spots. The integrated microsystem was characterized and optimized by means of fluidics, dispersion, operational stability and sensitivity parameters. The dispensing unit was developed specifically to match high-resolution capillary LC separations using a dispenser with an internal volume from inlet to the ejecting nozzle of 250 nl. Minimizing dead volumes was crucial in order to maintain the chromatographic resolution. The volume of the ejected droplets was of the order of 60 pl.

The results indicated monocyte adhesion and activation on a material might differ to a great extent, depending on the surface morphology and wettability. As the polymer wettability increases, the ability of monocytes to adhere increases but the ability to produce cytokines decreases. Similarly, these polymers, when prepared with porous surfaces, enhance monocyte adhesion but suppress monocyte release of cytokines. Therefore, the hydrophobic PVDF with a nonporous surface stimulates the most activity in adherent monocytes but shows the greatest inhibition of monocyte adhesion when compared with all of the other membranes. In contrast, the hydrophilic Nylon-66, which has a porous surface, is a relatively better substrate for this work. Therefore, monocyte behavior on a biomaterial may be influenced by a specific surface property. Based on this result, we propose that monocyte adhesion is regulated by a different mechanism than monocyte activation. Consequently, the generation of cytokines by monocytes is not proportional to the number of cells adherent to the surface.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research", "date": "2000-04-11", "authors": ["T HYoung", "D TLin", "L YChen"], "doi": "10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(20000615)50:4<490::aid-jbm4>3.0.co;2-n"}

In contrast, larval (L2) complex II shows a much lower FRD activity than the adult enzyme, and functions as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in aerobic respiration. We have reported the stage-specific isoforms of complex II in A. suum mitochondria, and showed that at least the flavoprotein subunit (Fp) and the small subunit of cytochrome b (cybS) of the larval complex II differ from those of adult. In the present study, complete cDNAs for the iron-sulfur subunit (Ip) of complex II, which with Fp forms the catalytic portion of complex II, have been cloned and sequenced from anaerobic adult A. suum, and the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The amino acid sequences of the Ip subunits of these two nematodes are similar, particularly around the three cysteine-rich regions that are thought to comprise the iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme. The Ip from A. suum larvae was also characterized because Northern hybridization showed that the adult Ip is also expressed in L2. The Ip of larval complex II was recognized by the antibody against adult Ip, and was indistinguishable from the adult Ip by peptide mapping. The N-terminal 42 amino acid sequence of Ip in the larval complex II purified by DEAE-cellulofine column chromatography was identical to that of the mature form of the adult Ip. Furthermore, the amino acid composition of larval Ip determined by micro-analysis on a PVDF membrane is almost the same as that of adult Ip. These results, together with the fact, that homology probing by RT-PCR, using degenerated primers, failed to find a larval-specific Ip, suggest that the two different stage-specific forms of the A. suum complex II share a common Ip subunit, even though the adult enzyme functions as a FRD, while larval enzyme acts as an SDH.", "journal": "Molecular and biochemical parasitology", "date": "2000-04-01", "authors": ["HAmino", "HWang", "HHirawake", "FSaruta", "DMizuchi", "RMineki", "NShindo", "KMurayama", "STakamiya", "TAoki", "SKojima", "KKita"], "doi": "10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00200-5"}

Two piezoelectric triaxial force transducers mounted in the right pedal measured components of the pedal force and orientation, and a discrete transducer system with 12 transducers recorded the in-shoe pressures. Force application was characterized by calculating peak resultant and peak effective pedal forces and positive and negative impulses. In-shoe pressures were analysed as peak pressures and as the percent relative load. The force data showed no significant group effect but there was a cadence and power main effect. The impulse data showed a significant three-way interaction. Increased cadence resulted in a decreased positive impulse, while increased power output resulted in an increased impulse. The competitive group produced less positive impulse but the difference became less at higher cadences. Few between-group differences were found in pressure, notable only in the pressure under the first metatarsal region. This showed a consistent pattern of in-shoe pressure distribution, where the primary loading structures were the first metatarsal and hallux.

The focus of the investigation was on testing the functionality of these motors within the MRI and to determining the image interference they caused.\nTo obtain a differentiated estimate of the interference the motors were tested in both the passive (turned off, i.e. without current flow) and active (turned on, i.e. with current flow) state during MRI scanning. Three different types of sequences were used for the test: Spin-Echo (SE), Gradient-Echo (GE) and Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI). A plastic container filled with a gadolinium-manganese solution was used for representation of the artefacts. The motors investigated were placed parallel to the container at predetermined distances during the experiment.\nThe results show that the motors investigated suffered no functional limitations in the magnetic field of the MRI but, depending on the type of motor, the measurement distance and the state of the motor, the motors had different effects on the sequence images. A motor in the off-state placed immediately next to the object to be measured mainly causes artefacts because of its material properties. If, on the other hand, the piezomotor is in the on-state images with strong noise result when the motor is immediately next to the object being measured. The images regain their normal quality when the motor is approximately at a distance of 1 m from the object being investigated. Driving the motor inside the MRI, therefore, is only to be recommended during the pauses in scanning: this delivers artefact-free images if minimal, motor-specific distances are kept to. With regard to the three different types of sequences it was determined that the SE sequence was the least sensitive and the EPI sequence the most sensitive to disturbance. The GE sequence showed only minimal differences to the SE sequence with regard to signal-to-noise ratios.

{"title": "Altered LV inotropic reserve and mechanoenergetics early in the development of heart failure.", "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that alterations in left ventricular (LV) mechanoenergetics and the LV inotropic response to afterload manifest early in the evolution of heart failure, we examined six anesthetized dogs instrumented with LV micromanometers, piezoelectric crystals, and coronary sinus catheters before and after 24 h of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP). After autonomic blockade, the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR), myocardial O(2) consumption (MVO(2)), and LV pressure-volume area (PVA) were defined at several different afterloads produced by graded infusions of phenylephrine. Short-term RVP resulted in reduced preload with proportionate reductions in stroke work and the maximum first derivative of LV pressure but with no significant reduction in baseline LV contractile state. In response to increased afterload, the baseline ESPVR shifted to the left with maintained end-systolic elastance (E(es)). In contrast, after short-term RVP, in response to comparable increases in afterload, the ESPVR displayed reduced E(es) (P < 0.05) and significantly less leftward shift compared with control (P < 0.05). Compared with the control MVO(2)-PVA relation, short-term RVP significantly increased the MVO(2) intercept (P < 0.05) with no change in slope. These results indicate that short-term RVP produces attenuation of afterload-induced enhancement of LV performance and increases energy consumption for nonmechanical processes with maintenance of contractile efficiency, suggesting that early in the development of tachycardia heart failure, there is blunting of length-dependent activation and increased O(2) requirements for excitation-contraction coupling, basal metabolism, or both. Rather than being adaptive mechanisms, these abnormalities may be primary defects involved in the progression of the heart failure phenotype.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The used model drugs were propranolol-HCl (1.0 mg) and FITC-dextran MW 4400 (1.0 mg). Drug release in vivo was studied by inserting membrane bags into the stomach and proximal duodenum of anesthetized rats and dogs. At 30 and 180 min, the bags were removed from the lumens and residual drug content was determined. The release of either propranolol or FITC-dextran were comparable in both stomach and duodenum, showing that in vivo drug release did not depend on environmental pH.

To investigate the role of amino acid residues in the rabbit FPA sequence upon habutobin action, we examined the inhibitory effects of FPA and peptides containing partial sequences of FPA on the habutobin action. Fibrinopeptides from rabbit, human, bovine and dog were isolated and rabbit FPA was fragmented using dilute HCl. Rabbit FPA inhibited the action of habutobin although FPA from human, bovine and dog did not. Among the fragments of rabbit FPA, a heptapeptide Aalpha 3-9, the N-terminal region of rabbit FPA, competitively inhibited the release of FPA by habutobin, whereas the C-terminal hexapeptide of FPA (Aalpha 11-16) exerted no effect on the habutobin action. Synthetic tripeptides Ser-Thr-Phe corresponding to Aalpha 6-8 and Ala-Thr-Phe also inhibited the habutobin action, but Ser-Asp-Phe and Ala-Thr-Gly did not.

{"title": "Regulation of kinetic properties of GluR2 AMPA receptor channels by alternative splicing.", "abstract": "The four subunits of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (GluR1-GluR4 or GluR-A-GluR-D) exist in two distinct forms, flip and flop, generated by alternative splicing of a 115 bp region. The GluR2 subunit plays a key role in determining the functional properties of the AMPA receptor channel. In this study, we examined the differences in kinetic properties between the flip and flop splice variants of the GluR2 subunit expressed in Xenopus oocytes using fast agonist application techniques. Glutamate was applied to outside-out patches from oocytes with piezo-driven double-barreled application pipettes. Because homomeric receptor channels composed of the edited form of GluR2 (GluR2R) produce no appreciable current responses, we expressed the unedited form of GluR2 (GluR2Q) in oocytes, which produced large current responses sufficient for analysis of the kinetic properties. The time constant for desensitization during application of 1 mM glutamate was 5.89 +/- 0. 17 msec (n = 50) in flip and 1.18 +/- 0.05 msec (n = 37) in flop. The deactivation time constant was 0.62 +/- 0.06 msec (n = 10) in flip and 0.54 +/- 0.05 msec (n = 10) in flop. The steady-state nondesensitizing current was 6.8 +/- 0.4% (n = 53) of the peak current in flip, whereas it was almost negligible in flop, being only 1.1 +/- 0.1% (n = 36). The slower desensitization kinetics and larger steady-state current responses in the flip variant were also observed in heteromeric receptors assembled from GluR2Q/GluR2R.

We were interested whether intercellular Ca(2+) waves are also associated with changes in other intra- or extracellular ions. To that purpose, we investigated spatiotemporal changes of intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(i)2+), sodium (Na(i)+) and protons (H(i)+) in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes using microfluorescence imaging with fura-2, SBFI and BCECF, respectively; changes of extracellular potassium (K(e)+) were monitored with K(+)-sensitive microelectrodes. Mechanical damage to a single cell by stimulation with a piezo-electrically driven micropipette initiated intercellular Ca(2+) waves that propagated to about 160 microm away from the stimulation point. Na(i)(+) increases could be detected in cells located 2-3 cell diameters from the stimulated cell, acidification was observed 1-2 cell diameters away and Ke(+) increases were measured up to 75 microm away. Kinetic analysis suggests that the Na(i)(+) and H(i)(+) changes occur after, and thus secondary to the Ca(i)(2+) changes. In contrast, K(e)(+) changes occurred very fast, even before the Ca(i)(2+) changes, but their propagation speed was too fast to implicate them as a trigger of Ca(i)(2+) changes. As Na(i)(+) is an important regulator of glycolysis in astrocytes, we hypothesize that astrocytic Na(i)(+) changes in cells located remotely from a damaged cell might be a signal that activates glycolysis thereby producing more lactate that is transferred to the neurons and increases their energy potential to survive the inflicted damage.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2000-03-04", "authors": ["KPaemeleire", "LLeybaert"], "doi": "10.1016/s0006-8993(99)02436-1"}

The purposes of this study were to develop the most stringent criteria possible for a positive test result, to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the EPM Western blot antibody test, and to assess the ability of bovine antibodies to Sarcocystis cruzi to act as a blocking agent to minimize false-positive results in the western blot test for S. neurona. Sarcocystis neurona merozoites harvested from equine dermal cell culture were heat denatured, and the proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 12-20% linear gradient gel. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween-Tris-buffered saline. Serum samples from 6 horses with S. neurona infections (confirmed by culture from neural tissue) and 57 horses without infections (horses from the Eastern Hemisphere, where S. neurona does not exist) were tested by Western blot. Horses from both groups had reactivity to the 62-, 30-, 16-, 13-, 11-, 10.5-, and 10-kD bands. Testing was repeated with another step. Blots were treated with bovine S. cruzi antibodies prior to loading the equine samples. After this modification of the Western blot test, positive infection status was significantly associated with reactivity to the 30- and 16-kD bands (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test). The S. cruzi antibody-blocked Western blot had a sample sensitivity of 100% and sample specificity of 98%.

We report several occurrences of a potentially dangerous interaction between a continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) system and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation device in four patients requiring both systems. The patients had acute renal failure in the face of multi-organ failure and were dependent upon the balloon pump for pressure support. Electrical interference created by the roller pump action of the CVVHD system was identified by the balloon pump as cardiac in origin, and it responded by inflation and deflation. As the blood pump rate was reduced, the interference reduced to the point of complete cessation when the blood pump was shut down. Whereas one patient transiently had a significant drop of mean arterial pressure (from 70 +/- 4 to 40 +/- 2 mm Hg) the other observed occurrences had no clinically significant sequelae. Electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings identified the abnormal stimulus and systematic review identified as potential sources for the creation of this interference static electricity buildup, piezoelectric properties of the polyvinyl chloride tubing, and, possibly but less likely, radiofrequency interference. A newer generation ECG cable and advanced cardiac rhythm recognition software (CardioSync) have been introduced with the Datascope System 98, and the ECG interference, although still occasionally present, does not cause erratic inflation and deflation of the intra-aortic balloon pump.

Regional and total LV volumes (conductance catheter), regional shortening (epicardial piezoelectric crystals), and LV pressure were measured before, during, and after transient esmolol-induced apical RWMA. Regional phase angle (alpha) was defined as the relative distance, measured in degrees, that regional minimal volume differs from global end-systole. We compared maximal stroke volume (SV) with effective SV (that portion of regional SV contributing to total LV SV). Regional effective SV was also calculated from our model as the product of cosine alpha and regional maximal SV.

The adequacy and accuracy of this modeling method have been numerically and experimentally verified.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2000-01-21", "authors": ["EMoulin", "JAssaad", "CDelebarre", "DOsmont"], "doi": "10.1121/1.428294"}
{"title": "Minimal compression of ultrathin sections with use of an oscillating diamond knife.", "abstract": "With the aim to minimize compression artefacts in ultrathin sections, coincident with the stroke direction, we have invented an oscillating diamond knife. Results and theoretical considerations explaining its function are discussed. During conventional ultrathin sectioning the resultant compression is in the order of 20-35% of section height. This holds true for sections of samples embedded into Lowicryl HM20 and of the polymer polystyrene, cut with a 45 degrees diamond knife and floated on water. The oscillating knife reduces this compression almost completely. It consists of a diamond knife on which a low voltage piezoelectric translator (piezo) is mounted, which oscillates when the piezo is driven by an alternating voltage source. No additional cutting artefacts were observed in the micrographs when they were compared with sections produced without oscillating the knife.", "journal": "Journal of microscopy", "date": "2000-01-05", "authors": ["DStuder", "HGnaegi"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2818.2000.00638.x"}
{"title": "Pathophysiological mechanisms of oropharyngeal dysphagia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "abstract": "We investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms of dysphagia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Forty-three patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were examined by clinical and electrophysiological methods that objectively measured the oropharyngeal phase of voluntarily initiated swallowing, and these results were compared with those obtained from 50 age-matched control subjects. Laryngeal movements were detected by a piezoelectric sensor and EMG of submental muscles, and needle EMG of the cricopharyngeal muscle of the upper oesophageal sphincter of both the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control groups was recorded during swallowing. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with dysphagia displayed the following abnormal findings. (i) Submental muscle activity of the laryngeal elevators, which produce reflex upward deflection of the larynx during wet swallowing, was significantly prolonged whereas the laryngeal relocation time of the swallowing reflex remained within normal limits. (ii) The cricopharyngeal sphincter muscle EMG demonstrated severe abnormalities during voluntarily initiated swallows. The opening of the sphincter was delayed and/or the closure occurred prematurely, the total duration of opening was shortened and, at times, unexpected motor unit bursts appeared during this period. (iii) During voluntarily initiated swallows there was significant lack of co-ordination between the laryngeal elevator muscles and the cricopharyngeal sphincter muscle. These results point to two pathophysiological mechanisms that operate to cause dysphagia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. (i) The triggering of the swallowing reflex for the voluntarily initiated swallow is delayed and eventually abolished, whereas the spontaneous reflexive swallows are preserved until the preterminal stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (ii) The cricopharyngeal sphincter muscle of the upper oesophageal sphincter becomes hyper-reflexic and hypertonic. As a result, the laryngeal protective system and the bolus transport system of deglutition lose their co-ordination during voluntarily initiated swallowing. We conclude that these pathophysiological changes are related mainly to the progressive degeneration of the excitatory and inhibitory corticobulbar pyramidal fibres.", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "date": "1999-12-28", "authors": ["CErtekin", "IAydogdu", "NY\u00fcceyar", "NKiylioglu", "STarlaci", "BUludag"], "doi": "10.1093/brain/123.1.125"}
{"title": "Lower limb muscle dysfunction may contribute to foot ulceration in diabetic patients.", "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between in-shoe plantar foot pressure and the co-ordinated activity of five lower limb muscles of diabetic patients, who are known to have a higher risk of foot morbidity.\nA portable six channel electromyographic system has been designed, developed and synchronised in real time with a 16 channel piezoelectric transducer in-shoe pressure measuring device, Gaitscan.\nSo far, no one has tried to establish a relationship between in-shoe foot pressure distribution and muscle activity of the lower limb in diabetes. The measurement of phasic muscle activity has been related to foot pressure and compared to a control group of normal volunteers.\nTwenty nine diabetic subjects and 22 healthy non-diabetic volunteers have been studied by recording electromyography of lower leg muscles and in-shoe foot pressure measurements simultaneously.\nIn diabetic subjects, the period of contact pressure was greater than in normal control subjects (P<0.003). The initial forefoot time to contact with the ground was shorter in diabetics when compared to controls, indicating a faster forefoot contact. Of the dorsiflexor muscles, the Anterior Tibialis, normally contracting eccentrically at heel strike, was subject to a measurable delay in the initiation of contraction, of mean difference of 180 ms (P<0.001), in diabetic subjects when compared to the normal controls.\nThe late firing of Tibialis Anterior means that its normal modulating role in lowering the foot to the ground after heel strike through eccentric contraction is disturbed. The result is that the foot reaches the foot flat stage in a less ordered manner, subjecting it to high plantar pressures.\nThe results obtained may assist in planning realignment procedures of the foot and help prevent development of ulcers on the sole of the foot in high risk diabetic subjects.", "journal": "Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)", "date": "1999-12-11", "authors": ["R JAbboud", "D IRowley", "R WNewton"], "doi": "10.1016/s0268-0033(99)00038-8"}
