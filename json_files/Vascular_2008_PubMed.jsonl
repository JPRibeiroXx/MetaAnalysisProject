{"title": "Allograft mass as a possible contributing factor to the skin transplant outcome.", "abstract": "A composite tissue consists of tissues derived from ectoderm and mesoderm typically containing skin, fat, muscle, nerves, lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow or any combination of these. Solid organ transplants possessing larger allograft mass were reported to survive better. As for the vascularized composite tissues however, thus far no study has comparatively studied the survival of grafts possessing different tissue burdens. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of transplanted tissue burden and tissue type on survival of skin element of composite tissues.\nForty-five transplantations were performed using four different vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation models. The survival periods and rejection severity of the skin parts of the transplants were compared by histological, immunological, and macroscopic evaluation: (a) under no immunosuppressive treatment (control group) (n = 21); (b) after 1 week of Cyclosporine (CsA) treatment (16 mg/kg) (experimental group) (n = 24). Total rejection was defined as necrosis of >90% of the skin flaps. Histopathologic evaluation and flow cytometric analysis to detect chimerism rates in the blood was performed in the CsA treated animals on day 18.\nThe differences of mean survival times between and within the experimental and control groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Histopathological outcomes showed lower rejection grades in skin allografts transplanted with a higher tissue burden. Total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell chimerism rates were less than 1% in isolated skin transplant groups and ranged from 6.1 to 33.5% in skin flaps transplanted with the entire hindlimb or a part of it.\nThe transplanted tissue burden as well as the tissue type can be an important factor for the skin transplant outcome.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2010-05-19", "authors": ["Betul GozelUlusal", "Ali EnginUlusal", "Fu ChanWei", "Chun-YenLin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2008.05.016"}

Dermal repair leads to epidermal and basement membrane regeneration. Burn wounds in particular have been shown to benefit from Integra by enhanced wound healing.\nTo evaluate the effect of fibrin glue to modify the integration of Integra in large excised cutaneous wounds. It was hypothesized that applying fibrin glue on a wound bed would reduce the time needed for matrix vascularization and incorporation of Integra and take of the cultured keratinocytes.\nFour separate full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of two swine. Wound beds were randomly assigned to either application of fibrin glue or no application of fibrin glue before application of Integra. Full-thickness biopsies were performed at days 7, 14, 21, 29 and 35. On day 21, keratinocytes were applied either as sheets or aerosolized fibrin glue suspension.\nHistological analysis revealed a wave of inflammatory cells and early granulation tissue ingrowth into the Integra from the fascia below on day 7. Only this initial phase was augmented by application of fibrin glue to the wound bed. By day 14, most and by day 21, all of the Integra thickness was incorporated. Accelerated dermal repair proceeded from the base with new collagen deposition in Integra spaces. There was no evidence of keratinocyte engraftment, although re-epithelialization occurred at wound edges extending onto the incorporated Integra.\nIt appears there is an acceleration of early phase (day 7 to day 21) dermal incorporation with fibrin glue application to the wound bed, perhaps secondary to increased cellular migration. Day 21 appears to be too early to apply cultured keratinocytes either as sheets or aerosolized suspension.\nUne matrice artificielle du derme, comme Integra (Integra Life Sciences Corporation, \u00c9tats-Unis), fournit une matrice pour le lit de la plaie, favorisant l\u2019interposition vasculaire et fibrocytaire et le remodelage du collag\u00e8ne.

Such information is crucial to understanding the role of these cells in immune surveillance. Wholemount preparations of retinas from late embryonic, postnatal and adult rabbits were subjected to three-colour fluorescence microscopy using beta2 integrin (CD18) and MHCII antibodies and biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia B4 isolectin labelling of blood vessels. CD18+ cells consistently exhibited characteristics of macrophages or microglia in the vascularized and non-vascularized regions of the retina, respectively. At all ages, MHCII was expressed by a high proportion of cells in the vascularized region, which contained macrophage-like 'parenchymal cells' as well as typical perivascular macrophages. MHCII expression by ramified microglia, first detected on postnatal day 30, was lower in the peripheral retina and intermediate in the avascular region of the myelinated streak. The observed localization of MHCII+ cells in relation to blood vessels and location-dependent differences in MHCII expression point to the possibility that these cells may be distributed strategically within the retina to provide multiple lines of defence against immune challenge arriving via the retinal vasculature.", "journal": "Neuron glia biology", "date": "2009-07-07", "authors": ["WenbingHuang", "Coral GChamberlain", "Richard YSarafian", "TailoiChan-Ling"], "doi": "10.1017/S1740925X0999007X"}

{"title": "Resident vascular progenitor cells: an emerging role for non-terminally differentiated vessel-resident cells in vascular biology.", "abstract": "Throughout development and adult life the vasculature exhibits a remarkably dynamic capacity for growth and repair. The vasculature also plays a pivotal role in the execution of other diverse biologic processes, such as the provisioning of early hematopoietic stem cells during embryonic development or the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. Adding to this importance, from an anatomical perspective, the vasculature is clearly an omnipresent organ, with few areas of the body that it does not penetrate. Given these impressive characteristics, it is perhaps to be expected that the vasculature should require, or at least be associated with, a ready supply of stem and progenitor cells. However, somewhat surprisingly, it is only now just beginning to be broadly appreciated that the vasculature plays host to a range of vessel-resident stem and progenitor cells. The possibility that these vessel-resident cells are implicated in processes as diverse as tumor vascularization and adaptive vascular remodeling appears likely, and several exciting avenues for clinical translation are already under investigation.

Macroscopic fluorescence imaging showed that Ce6-PVP-induced fluorescence had a higher sensitivity and specificity for delineating tumor from the adjacent normal CAM compared to Ce6 alone. Nonlinear regression analyses have shown that Ce6-PVP has a longer half-life in the tumor compared to Ce6. The uptake ratio of Ce6-PVP was found to have a 2-fold increase across the CAM when compared to that of Ce6, indicating that PVP was able to facilitate diffusion of Ce6 across the membrane. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further confirmed that Ce6-PVP has better penetration in the CAM as well as in the tumor cells compared to Ce6.

To this end, biological agents used for therapeutic neovascularization must be explored beyond the current well-investigated classes.

{"title": "Role of hyaluronan in angiogenesis and its utility to angiogenic tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis represents the outgrowth of new blood vessels from existing ones, a physiologic process that is vital to supply nourishment to newly forming tissues during development and tissue remodeling and repair (wound healing). Regulation of angiogenesis in the healthy body occurs through a fine balance of angiogenesis-stimulating factors and angiogenesis inhibitors. When this balance is disturbed, excessive or deficient angiogenesis can result and contribute to development of a wide variety of pathological conditions. The therapeutic stimulation or suppression of angiogenesis could be the key to abrogating these diseases. In recent years, tissue engineering has emerged as a promising technology for regenerating tissues or organs that are diseased beyond repair. Among the critical challenges that deter the practical realization of the vision of regenerating functional tissues for clinical implantation, is how tissues of finite size can be regenerated and maintained viable in the long-term. Since the diffusion of nutrients and essential gases to cells, and removal of metabolic wastes is typically limited to a depth of 150-250 microm from a capillary (3-10 cells thick), tissue constructs must mandatorily permit in-growth of a blood capillary network to nourish and sustain the viability of cells within. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the role and significance of hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) component of connective tissues, in physiologic and pathological angiogenesis, its applicability as a therapeutic to stimulate or suppress angiogenesis in situ within necrotic tissues in vivo, and the factors determining its potential utility as a pro-angiogenic stimulus that will enable tissue engineering of neo-vascularized and functional tissue constructs for clinical use.", "journal": "Organogenesis", "date": "2009-04-02", "authors": ["Erin LPardue", "SamirIbrahim", "AnandRamamurthi"], "doi": "10.4161/org.4.4.6926"}
{"title": "Modified ulnar translocation technique for the reconstruction of giant cell tumor of the distal radius.", "abstract": "Giant cell tumors of the distal radius have been frequently described as difficult to treat, chiefly because of their close proximity to multiple tendons, median nerve, radial artery and carpus.The aim of treatment is to remove the tumor completely and preserve the radiocarpal and radioulnar joints.However, this is not always feasible as giant cell tumors seem to behave more aggressively and have a higher recurrence rate in the distal radius, even if local adjuvant treatment with phenolmethylmethacrylate or liquid nitrogen is applied. The above incidence is increased in Campanacci grade III lesions, which are characterized by fuzzy borders, loss of cortical continuity, and extension into soft tissues. In these cases, wide excision instead of intralesional excision may be advocated, particularly when the tumor breaks through the cortex, violates the articular surface, and destroys >50% of the surrounding metaphysis. Several reconstructive options (e.g., resection arthroplasty, prosthetic replacement, arthrodesis, ulnar translocation, centralization of the carpus over the remaining ulna, use of a nonvascularized, or vascularized fibular graft [with or without arthrodesis], and allograft replacement) have been described for the treatment of either recurrent or primary grade III giant cell tumor with destruction of the bone cortex and associated soft tissue mass.

This review considers the potential roles of the NG2 proteoglycan in glioma progression. NG2 is expressed not only by glioma cells and by oligodendrocyte progenitors, but also by pericytes associated with the tumor microvasculature. The proteoglycan may therefore promote tumor vascularization and recruitment of normal progenitors to the tumor mass, in addition to mediating expansion of the transformed cell population. Along with potentiating growth factor signaling and serving as a cell surface receptor for extracellular matrix components, NG2 also has the ability to mediate activation of beta-1 integrins.

Previous studies have indicated that transplanted cells for varied reasons were not surviving in sufficient numbers following transplantation, thus negatively affecting overall therapeutic efficacy of the approach. We hypothesize that the genetic modification of myoblasts to express insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) locally may enhance the survival of transplanted cells by stimulating neo-vascularization, decreasing apoptosis, and promoting cell proliferation. Using an adeno-associated virus (adeno-associated virus type 2) vector system, the IGF-1 gene was introduced into canine skeletal myoblasts. As a negative control, myoblasts transduced with the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was used. Relative angiogenic response induced by IGF-1 myoblast was compared to VEGF165-induced neo-vascularization using Matrigel plugs under similar conditions. In vitro evaluation and characterization revealed that the secreted IGF-1 protein was biologically and functionally active in promoting endothelial cell proliferation, migration and assembly into vessel-like structures. Matrigel plugs containing the three test groups were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice (n = 5). After 3 weeks, analysis of explanted samples revealed an enhanced neo-vascularization with an average microvessel density per field for IGF-1 at 55.9 versus 33.4 for vascular endothelial growth factor and 24 for GFP. Additionally, apoptosis was significantly reduced (p <or= 0.02) and proliferative capacity of implanted cells significantly increased (p <or= 0.01) with the IGF-1-transduced myoblasts.

Energy storing and free fatty acids production were the only adipose tissue functions. However, it has been well established other adipose tissue functions like low grade pro-inflammatory molecules production (cytokines, adipokines and chemotactic factors) evolved in obese inflammatory condition. In this inflammatory state, adipocytes active role is inflammatory mediators (adipokines) production and and cell to cell interaction with resident macrophages. Adipose tissue low vascularization is even lower in the obese; so, hypoxia can be a critical factor in inflammatory obese state manifestation. Adipose tissue cytokines production and pre-adipocyte conversion into macrophage results in adipose tissue and macrophages interactions. One of the mononuclear phagocytic system components, macrophage, has an important role in obese-related inflammatory state. These cells have been found to be increased in number and shape proportional to Body Mass Index, rising to up to 60% of total adipose tissue components. The macrophages proportional accumulation could lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory molecules expression and contribute to the inflammatory state in a significant way. The reversion of the low grade inflammation and the reduction of risk factors in obese individuals seem to occur when a reduction in Body Mass Index is achieved and loss of adipose tissue is observed. We performed a critical review of last five years literature in order to better describe the impact of adipose tissue and macrophages interactions in low grade chronic inflammatory condition in the obese and their role in comorbidities pathogenesis.", "journal": "Acta medica portuguesa", "date": "2009-02-04", "authors": ["SofiaSantareno", "JoaoCerqueira", "JoaoPortugues", "JoanaCruz", "RenataRamalho", "CristinaGuimar\u00e3es"], "doi": null}

NO, synthesized by NOS, plays an important role in tumour growth, dissemination and vascularization. Caspase-3 is an executive enzyme of apoptosis. The presented research work has been focused on the comparative evaluation of localization of the angiogenic and proapoptotic cytokines expressed in tonsillar diseases. The immunohistochemical reaction of eNOS, iNOS and caspase-3 in tonsillar cancer (N = 17), chronic tonsillitis (N = 11) and clinically healthy tonsils (N = 8) was detected. High eNOS occurrence in endothelial cells of highly vascularized regions in tonsillar cancer, variable eNOS expression in the vessels of lamina propria in chronic tonsillitis and high expression in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells of small veins in healthy tonsillar tissue was ascertained. Increased iNOS expression was found in cancer tissue in comparison with the healthy tonsils. Nevertheless, the highest expression of iNOS was found in chronic tonsillitis. Higher expression of caspase-3 was discovered in germinal centres of lymphoid follicles of the chronic tonsillitis tissue. However, the positivity in the interfollicular zone and surface squamous epithelium was weak only. Merely isolated caspase-3-positive cells were found in tonsillar cancer. Very low expression of caspase-3 was detected in the lymphatic follicles of the healthy tonsils. Research results showed high expression of eNOS in the carcinomatous tissue. The eNOS expression in chronic tonsillitis confirms its role in regulating the lymphocyte circulation. Low expression of caspase-3 in malignant epithelial cells of tonsillar cancer shows decreased capability of apoptosis compared to chronic tonsillitis tissue, where apoptosis seems to be rather frequent and concentrated in the germinal centres of lymphatic follicles.

The objective of this study was to translate the peripheral washout sign as seen in solid tumours in delayed DCE-MRI in human onto an animal model for further assessment of DCE-MRI characteristics and histological analysis. Small molecular contrast medium DCE-MRI was performed over 42 min in experimental colon carcinoma grown subcutaneously in rats. Qualitative and quantitative analyses for evaluation of presence and characteristics of the peripheral washout sign were accomplished, defining four centripetally distributed tumour zones (central, intermediate, peripheral and marginal). One hundred per cent of the carcinomas demonstrated a peripheral washout sign in DCE-MRI starting at 20 min after bolus injection. Histomorphological analysis was performed for tissue classification and evaluation of microvasculature. Quantitative analysis revealed different enhancement profiles of the four tumour zones. Histology indicated centripetally asymmetric vascularization and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF/VEGF receptor 2 expression within the tumour tissue.

This surgical procedure avoids nephronic waste with an acceptable morbidity and similar oncological outcomes compared to radical surgery. Recent large published series did not show any difference between NSS and RN in terms of oncological safety. Specific and disease-free five-year survival rates (82% to 97.3% and 81% to 97.3%, respectively) have confirmed the safety of NSS. Regarding laparoscopic NSS, the technique is still under evaluation and only mid-term outcomes are available so far. However, these studies are still limited and longer follow-up is needed before any definitive statement can be made. Current guidelines recommend NSS only in case of RCC of less than 4 cm in diameter in elective indications. In daily practice however, surgical teams are pushing back the limit above the threshold of 4 cm. More and more surgeons are either considering anatomical location or technical expected difficulties rather than just the tumour size. NSS leads to higher risk of bleeding, especially in case of tumours larger than 4 cm.

To use oral tumours, compared with adjacent normal mucosa, as positive controls.\nParaffin-embedded sections were stained with antibodies to von Willebrand factor (vWF), a pan-endothelial marker, and CD105, a putative marker for angiogenic vessels. Vascularity was quantified by different methods reflecting vessel volume and density.\nIrrespective of the marker or method used, vascularity values were similar in periradicular granuloma and PDL. Both tissues were highly vascularized, with levels similar to those found in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Vascularity was significantly higher in the latter than in normal mucosa. Fewer vessels were positive for CD105 than for vWF in the normal mucosa, whereas similar numbers were found in the other tissues examined.\nA comparison of vascularity in oral tumours and normal oral mucosa provided evidence of angiogenesis in the former. Staining with CD105 added limited value to staining with vWF in these tissues. In contrast, a comparison of periradicular granuloma and PDL failed to demonstrate evidence of angiogenesis in the granuloma. As all vessels were similarly stained with vWF and CD105 in granuloma and PDL, a possible hypothesis is that all vessels are newly formed in these tissues. A more plausible alternative is that CD105 expression may reflect the metabolic activity or intrinsic characteristics of the tissues, rather than the presence of angiogenic vessels.", "journal": "International endodontic journal", "date": "2009-01-10", "authors": ["K JDavey", "SPerrier", "GOhe", "A DGilbert", "ABankfalvi", "W PSaunders", "S LSchor", "A MSchor"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2591.2008.01466.x"}

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing and are potent in differentiating into multiple cells and tissues. To investigate the practicability of repairing burn wounds with tissue-engineered (TE) skin combined with bone MSCs, we established a burn wound model in the porcine skin. With a controlling temperature and time of the burning device to obtain different degrees of burn wounds, a deep dermal partial thickness burn was introduced to the porcine skin using a heated-brass contact injury at 100 degrees C for 20 s. Collagen-GAG scaffolds were utilized as the matrix; MSCs separated from pigs were seeded on them to form the skin equivalent. When grafted to the burn wounds, the TE skin containing MSCs showed better healing and keratinization, less wound contraction, and more vascularization.

This approach to drug development requires rapid and reliable characterization of the new targets in established tumor models, such as xenografts and cell lines. Here, we have applied tissue microarray technology to patient-derived, re-growable human tumor xenografts. We have profiled the expression of five proteins involved in cell migration and/or angiogenesis: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), protease activated receptor (PAR1), cathepsin B, and beta1 integrin in a panel of over 150 tumors and compared their expression levels to available patient outcome data. For each protein, several target overexpressing xenografts were identified. They represent a subset of tumor models prone to respond to specific inhibitors and are available for future preclinical efficacy trials. In a \"proof of concept\" experiment, we have employed tissue microarrays to select in vivo models for therapy and for the analysis of molecular changes occurring after treatment with the anti-VEGF antibody HuMV833 and gemcitabine. Whereas the less angiogenic pancreatic cancer PAXF736 model proved to be resistant, the highly vascularized PAXF546 xenograft responded to therapy. Parallel analysis of arrayed biopsies from the different treatment groups revealed a down-regulation of Ki-67 and VEGF, an altered tissue morphology, and a decreased vessel density.

{"title": "Color-coded fluorescent protein imaging of angiogenesis: the AngioMouse models.", "abstract": "We have utilized multicolored fluorescent proteins to develop three imaging models of tumor angiogenesis. In one model, the nonluminous induced capillaries are clearly visible by contrast against the very bright tumor green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence examined either intravitally or by whole-body imaging in real time. Intravital images of an orthotopic model of human pancreatic tumors expressing GFP visualized angiogenic capillaries at both primary and metastatic sites. Whole-body optical imaging showed that blood vessel density increased linearly over a 20-week period in an orthotopic model of human breast cancer expressing GFP. Opening a reversible skin-flap in the light path markedly reduces signal attenuation, increasing detection sensitivity many-fold and enables vessels to be externally visualized in GFP-expressing tumors growing on internal organs. In another model, dual-color fluorescence imaging was effected by using red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing tumors growing in GFP-expressing transgenic mice that express GFP in all cells. This dual-color model visualizes with great clarity the details of the tumor-stroma interaction, especially tumor-induced angiogenesis. The GFP-expressing tumor vasculature, both nascent and mature, are readily distinguished interacting with the RFP-expressing tumor cells. The third model involves a transgenic mouse in which the regulatory elements of the stem cell marker nestin drive GFP (ND-GFP). The ND-GFP mouse expresses GFP in nascent blood vessels. RFP-expressing tumors transplanted to nestin-GFP mice enable specific visualization of nascent vessels. The ND-GFP mouse was utilized to develop a rapid in vivo/ex vivo fluorescent angiogenesis assay by implanting Gelfoam which was vascularized by fluorescent nascent blood vessels. This process could be markedly stimulated or inhibited by specific compounds. We also observed, using ND-GFP mice, that the hair follicle is angiogenic and that the hair-follicle vascular network is a prime target for chemotherapy drugs which cause hair loss (chemotherapy-induced alopecia).

The airway wall is more vascularized in COPD patients than in healthy subjects, though this phenomenon is less evident than in asthmatic patients. The vascular mucosal changes in the airways of patients with COPD are strictly linked to the inflammatory processes. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the microvascular changes are still unclear, however, pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, TGF-beta, FGF, and proteolytic enzymes such as MMPs, may play a role. Up to now, the clinical and functional consequences of this phenomenon and the therapeutic approach have been scarcely investigated. Inhaled corticosteroids seem to have positive effects, by reducing the vascular area and growth factor expression. Specific antagonists to VEGF, TGF- beta, FGF, and MMPs could beneficially control chronic airway inflammation and vascular remodeling in COPD as well as slow down the progression of the disease. Several of these growth factor antagonists are being evaluated and some seem to be effective in reducing vascularity, however further studies are required to ascertain whether or not these antagonists may play a role in COPD therapy.", "journal": "Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease", "date": "2009-01-07", "authors": ["AndreaZanini", "AlfredoChetta", "DarioOlivieri"], "doi": "10.1177/1753465808092339"}

However, these potential roles of VEGF in the CNS have not been clarified in model animals. Here we have created transgenic mice overexpressing a short active variant of VEGF-A (VEGF120) in forebrain. Expression of VEGF120 significantly enhanced cell proliferation and angiogenesis, as exemplified by the formation of an enlarged reddish brain. Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus was markedly stimulated without affecting cell differentiation of neural progenitor cells. Hippocampal neurogenesis was particularly robust in young adult animals, but it declined with age and reduced to control levels by 20 weeks under continuous expression of VEGF120. Thus, VEGF alone is not sufficient to support the long-term enhancement of adult neurogenesis, and VEGF-induced vascularization per se does not necessarily predict increased neurogenesis. In transgenic mice, we observed significant changes in affective behaviors. VEGF was found to have not only antidepressant effects but also anxiolytic effects. In addition, we found that VEGF significantly reduced fear and aggression. In contrast, basal activities under natural conditions were not affected much. Unexpectedly, these characteristic behaviors were maintained in older transgenic mice undergoing a reduced level of cell proliferation in hippocampus, suggesting that there is potential dissociation between adult neurogenesis and mood regulation.

In the present study, we used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model system to determine the role of insulin in the chemical signals regulating the processes of proliferation and viability (survival). MTT-based colorimetric methods demonstrated that insulin enhances proliferation and survival of HUVECs. Western blot analysis revealed that protein kinase B (pAkt [Thr(308)]) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were the insulin-responsive intermediates in proliferating endothelial cells (ECs). In insulin-enhanced survival, both pAkt (Thr(308)) and pAkt (Ser(473)) were activated in HUVECs. However, no change in VEGF expression accompanied pAkt activation. The beneficial effects of insulin were abrogated by insulin receptor (IR)/insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) or phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3-K) blockade, suggesting that insulin-induced EC proliferation and viability are mediated through pIR/pIGFR and PI3-K effectors.

{"title": "Reconstruction of large limb bone defects with a double-barrel free vascularized fibular graft.", "abstract": "The use of a free, vascularized fibular graft is an important technique for the reconstruction of large defects in long bones. The technique has many advantages in strong, tubular bones; a more reliable vascular anatomy with a large vascular diameter and long pedicle is used, minimizing donor-site morbidity. Due to limitations in both fibular anatomy and mechanics, they cannot effectively be used to treat large limb bone defects due to their volume and strength.\nFrom 1990 to 2001, 16 clinical cases of large bone defects were treated using vascularized double-barrel fibular grafts. Patients were evaluated for an average of 10 months after surgery.\nAll the patients achieved bony union; the average bone union took 10 months post surgery, and no stress fractures occurred. Compared with single fibular grafts, the vascularized double-barrel fibular grafts greatly facilitate bony union and are associated with fewer complications, suggesting that the vascularized double-barrel fibular graft is a valuable procedure for the correction of large bone defects in large, long bones in addition to enhancing bone intensity.\nThe vascularized double-barrel fibular graft is superior to the single fibular graft in stimulating osteogenous activity and biological mechanics for the correction of very large bone defects in large, long bones. Free vascularized folded double-barrel fibular grafts can not only fill up large bone defects, but also improve the intensity margin. Therefore, this study also widens its application and enlarges the treatment targets. However, in the case of bone deformability, special attention should be paid to bone fixation and protection of donor and recipient sites.", "journal": "Chinese medical journal", "date": "2008-12-24", "authors": ["Zheng-gangBi", "Xin-guangHan", "Chun-jiangFu", "YangCao", "Cheng-linYang"], "doi": null}

The simultaneous blockade of both the CD40 and CD28 pathways has been synergistic in prolonging organ allograft survival but has not previously been investigated in a model of limb allotransplantation. This study determined the efficacy of this combination in the murine limb allograft model. C57B1/6 (H-2K(b)) female mice were recipients of heterotopic vascularized limb allografts from Balb/c (H-2K(d)) male donors. Experimental groups received treatment with a short course of MR1 (hamster anti-mouse anti-CD40 ligand antibody) alone or in combination with CTLA4-Ig, a fusion protein that blocks the B7/CD28 pathway. Untreated recipients rejected limb allografts at a mean of 9.6 +/- 1.1 (standard error of the mean) days postoperatively. Recipients of a prolonged course of MR1 rejected limb allografts at 75 +/- 25 days. When both MR1 and CTLA4-Ig were used, limb allograft survival of >120 days was observed despite a much shorter course of therapy. Rejection in both treatment groups was consistent with a chronic antibody-mediated process. Donor antigen rechallenge in these recipients by in vitro assay and skin allograft demonstrated a hyperacute response consistent with presensitization. Long-term limb allograft survival is produced by the synergistic effect of blocking both the CD40 and CD28 costimulatory pathways. However, permanent acceptance was not achieved, and allografts eventually succumbed to what appeared to be antibody-mediated rejection. The additional use of newer agents that block more recently described costimulatory pathways may be essential for the induction of tolerance by costimulation blockade.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2008-12-23", "authors": ["T H HTung", "S EMackinnon", "TMohanakumar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.06.088"}

The chemokine CCL2/MCP-1 is expressed during allograft dysfunction, which is associated with the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Both intrinsic renal cells (donor origin) as well as infiltrating inflammatory cells (recipient origin) can be a source of CCL2/MCP-1. We previously demonstrated that the recipient MCP-1-2518G polymorphism is associated with increased CCL2/MCP-1 production by inflammatory cells and decreased renal allograft survival. We evaluated the impact of the MCP-1-2518G polymorphism in donor cells on renal allograft outcomes. We enrolled 252 recipients of kidney allografts in this retrospective study who had received grafts from 152 cadaveric donors. The CCL2/MCP-1 genotype was assessed using genomic DNA isolated from cryopreserved donor splenocytes. Outcome parameters studied were acute biopsy proven rejection (Banff criteria), serum creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 1 year after transplantation, allograft loss, and death.

We present our frontal hairline island flap design and results in our series of 10 patients.In our study, we aimed to reduce scarring at donor area by planning a forehead island flap in an elliptical fashion at the frontal hairline. There are no more incisions than the elliptical incision over the hairline. Primary closure of skin flaps at the donor ensures a final scar that is hidden at the frontal hairline border.

All patients had a mandibular defect caused by ablation of a malignant tumor. They had undergone radiotherapy at a total dose of 30 to 50 Gy to the surgical site after tumorectomy. Distraction osteogenesis was used as the secondary reconstruction method in 6 sites of the remaining irradiated mandibles and in 1 site of the transferred vascularized scapula after radiotherapy. The transported segment was obtained by corticotomy with an initial gap of 0 to 2 mm, and internal extension plates were used. Distraction was commenced after a latency period of 7 to 10 days and performed at the rate of 0.25 to 1.0 mm/d. The total amount of distraction and consolidation periods ranged from 15 to 25 mm and 120 to 193 days, respectively. In 5 of the 6 sites in the remaining irradiated mandibles, satisfactory bone formation in the distraction gap was observed, although a fracture after new bone formation was observed in 1 site. Fibrous callus formation was observed in 1 irradiated site only, and satisfactory results were obtained in another site of transferred vascularized scapula in the same patient. From these experiences, we believe that distraction may provide a reconstruction option for mandibular defects even under irradiated conditions because the procedure is simple and less invasive.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2008-12-23", "authors": ["KatsuhikoKashiwa", "SeiichiroKobayashi", "TakayaNohara", "TomoyukiYasuoka", "YukoHosoya", "HitomiFujiwara", "TakayukiHonda", "HiroakiKimura"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181897351"}

The reconstruction by a vascularized fibular graft represents the treatment of choice if the radial head is not dislocated. This procedure allows restoration of a balance between radius and ulna during growth. The presence of a vascularized graft enhances the potential for bony fusion in a fibrous environment. In cases of isolated ulna pseudarthrosis, a luxation of the proximal radial epiphysis may occur when the ulnar deformity increases with time.

{"title": "Education in vascular surgery: Critical issues in India.", "abstract": "The first department of vascular surgery in India was established in 1978, and the first training course in peripheral vascular surgery was started in 1985. Despite this, vascular surgery has been slow to develop in India. The widespread misconception that vascular diseases are uncommon and that the result of vascular reconstruction is poor has resulted in vascular surgery not being popular among the medical students. Only 10 medical colleges have dedicated vascular surgical departments; hence, most students do not have enough knowledge about vascular diseases and the treatment options. This lack of awareness has resulted in a delay in diagnosis of vascular problems that results in poor outcome. At present there are only seven training centers for vascular surgery, training 12 students every year. Students receive adequate training in open surgical procedures, but endovascular training is still inadequate. Endovascular treatment has not picked up because of the expense and nonavailability of catheterization laboratories to vascular surgeons. The Vascular Society of India (VSI) has proposed to correct these problems by starting more training centers in private hospitals, starting vascular services in different parts of the country, conducting a nationwide awareness campaign, and conducting more continuing medical education programs and workshops for the general surgical trainees. VSI has been conducting endovascular workshops for the vascular trainees and has arranged for fellowships abroad in reputed vascular units.

This procedure is inspired by Cantwell Ransley procedure for epispadias repair and Snodgras procedure for hypospadias repair. The entire urethral plate was mobilized (i.e., lifted off the corpora) distal to the urethral meatus and was tubularized in two layers; inner urethral skin and outer spongiosal tissue, in Duplay fashion. The repair was reinforced with dartos vascularized flap. The skin incisions on the urethral strip are guided by the disposition of the spongiosal tissue underlying the urethral plate (rather than the conventional U-shaped incision on either side of hypospadiac urethral meatus). In the patients with proximal hypospadias with severe chordee urethral advancement was combined to achieve orthoplasty and a single stage hypospadias repair. The catheter was removed on tenth postoperative day.\nEven in patients with proximal hypospadias with severe chordee, good single staged repair was achieved without resorting to dorsal plication that would have been necessary had any other methods based on the preservation of urethral plate was performed in these subjects. Therefore, the procedure was found to have an extended applicability to even those patients where tubularized incised urethral plate urethroplsty is not advised.

We first found that Wnt5a(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells exhibited a defect in endothelial differentiation, which was rescued by addition of Wnt5a, suggesting that Wnt5a is required for endothelial differentiation of ES cells. Involvement of both beta-catenin and protein kinase (PK)Calpha pathways in endothelial differentiation of mES cells requiring Wnt5a was indicated by activation of both beta-catenin and PKCalpha in Wnt5a(+/-) but not in Wnt5a(-/-) mES cells. We also found that beta-catenin or PKCalpha knockdowns inhibited the Wnt5a-induced endothelial differentiation of ES cells. Moreover, the lack of endothelial differentiation of Wnt5a(-/-) mES cells was rescued only by transfection of both beta-catenin and PKCalpha, indicating that both genes are required for Wnt5a-mediated endothelial differentiation. Wnt5a was also found to be essential for the differentiation of mES cells into immature endothelial progenitor cells, which are known to play a role in repair of damaged endothelium. Furthermore, a defect in the vascularization of the neural tissue was detected at embryonic day 14.5 in Wnt5a(-/-) mice, implicating Wnt5a in vascular development in vivo.

The Thoroughbred racehorse is a model in which adaptive failure and associated development of stress fracture is common. We performed a histologic study of the distal end of the third metacarpal bone in two groups of horses: young Thoroughbreds that were actively racing (n = 10) and a group of non-athletic horses (n = 8). The purpose of this study was to determine whether development of articular microcracks was associated with specific alterations to subchondral plate osteocytes. Morphometric measurements were made in five regions of the joint surface: lateral condyle, lateral condylar groove, sagittal ridge, medial condylar groove, and medial condyle. The following variables were quantified: hyaline cartilage width; calcified cartilage width; the number of tidemarks; microcrack density at the articular surface; blood vessel density entering articular cartilage; the presence of atypical bone matrix in the subchondral plate; bone volume fraction; and osteocyte density. Adaptation of articular cartilage was similar in both groups of horses. Vascularization of articular cartilage was increased in the group of non-athletic horses. Microcracks, which typically had an oblique orientation to the joint surface, were co-localized with blood vessels, and resorption spaces. Microcracking was increased in the condylar grooves of athletic horses compared with the other joint regions and was also increased compared with the condylar groove regions of non-athletic horses. Coalescence of microcracks also led to development of an intracortical articular condylar stress fracture in some joints and targeted remodeling of affected subchondral plate. The subchondral plate of the condyles in athletic horses was sclerotic, and contained atypically stained bone matrix with increased numbers of osteocytes with atypical morphology. However, osteocyte numbers were not significantly different between groups. We conclude that differences in site-specific microdamage accumulation and associated targeted remodeling between athletic and non-athletic horses are much greater than differences in subchondral osteocyte morphology. However, the presence of atypical subchondral bone matrix in athletic horses was associated with extensive osteocyte loss. Although osteocyte mechanotransduction is considered important for functional adaptation, in this model, adaptation is likely regulated by multiple mechanotransduction pathways.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2008-12-20", "authors": ["PMuir", "A LPeterson", "S JSample", "M CScollay", "M DMarkel", "V LKalscheur"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00996.x"}

{"title": "From anti-angiogenesis to anti-lymphangiogenesis: emerging trends in cancer therapy.", "abstract": "The theory that angiogenesis could support tumor growth and therefore be a target for cancer therapy was explored in publications by Judah Folkman in the 1970s. This theory was then fostered by Folkman for over 2 decades until, via modern molecular and cell biology techniques, it was vindicated in animal tumor models, and subsequently with the successful clinical trials of a humanized monoclonal antibody which neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the process of proving the \"anti-angiogenesis\" theory, researchers in vascular, cancer, and developmental biology have gained insight into how the vascular network operates at the molecular level. Following on from the wave of activity that accompanied the study of angiogenesis, some of the molecular mechanisms controlling the related process of lymphangiogenesis have now been identified. The growth of lymphatic vessels was found to be controlled by proteins related to VEGF, namely VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which are associated with a number of human tumor types. The experimental inhibition of this process in animal models has suggested that lymphangiogenic growth factors facilitate the metastatic spread of tumor cells via lymphatics. Unlike the anti-angiogenesis strategy, anti-lymphangiogenesis is yet to be tested clinically; however, the notion that anti-lymphangiogenesis may be beneficial for cancer therapy is supported by extensive data from animal models and clinicopatholgical data.

In this single-center study, the amount of blood flow in common adrenal lesions, such as adrenal adenomas, adrenal hyperplasia, and pheochromocytomas, was visualized by color-coded duplex EUS (CD-EUS) and was retrospectively analysed. Therefore, we reviewed our EUS database to evaluate and correlate the perfusion patterns of common adrenal lesions with histologically confirmed diagnosis, possible malignancy, and endosonomorphological features such as echogeneity, echostructure, and tumor size. CD-EUS was performed using an endosonoscope Pentax FG 32 UA with a longitudinal 7.5 MHz sector array and Hitachi EUB 525 ultrasound system. In 38 consecutive patients (male=19; female=19; age: mean 53+/-16 yr SD), perfusion patterns of 46 histologically confirmed adrenal, para- or extra-adrenal lesions of adrenal origin (adenoma: no.=20; nodular hyperplasia: no.=11; pheochromocytoma: no.=15; diameter 26+/-15 mm, range 6-70 mm) were analyzed and classified semiquantitatively as \"not\" (no.=24), \"slightly\" (no.=12), \"moderately\" (no.=4) or \"highly\" (no.=6) hypervascularized. Compared to adenomas (p=0.003) and nodular hyperplasia (p=0.047), pheochromocytomas showed a significantly higher grade of perfusion. There was no relationship between perfusion patterns and localization of pheochromocytomas (adrenal: 8; paraadrenal: 3; extra-adrenal: 4). Vascularization was not statistically associated with tumor echogeneity, echostructure, malignancy or tumor size. CD-EUS is an additional tool for adrenal endosonographic tumor distinction and seems to improve the endosonographic detection of pheochromocytomas by visualization of hypervascularization.

In this study we assessed the formation of pre-vascular structures by human outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) from progenitors in the peripheral blood and the osteogenic differentiation of primary human osteoblasts (pOB) on micrometric silk fibroin scaffolds. The rational was to gain more insight into the dynamic processes involved in the differentiation and functionality of both cell types depending on culture time in vitro. Vascular tube formation by OEC was assessed quantitatively at one and 4 weeks of culture. In parallel, we assessed the temporal changes in cell ratios by flow cytometry and in the marker profiles of endothelial and osteogenic markers by quantitative real-time PCR. In terms of OEC, we observed an increase in tube length, tube area, number of nodes and number of vascular meshes within a culture period of 4 weeks, but a decrease in endothelial markers in real-time PCR. At the same time early osteogenic markers were downregulated, while marker expression associated with progressing mineralized matrix was upregulated in later stages of the culture. In addition, deposition of matrix components, such as collagen type I, known as a pro-angiogenic substrate for endothelial cells, appeared to increase with time indicated by immunohistochemistry.

{"title": "Immune modulation in gastrointestinal disorders: new opportunities for therapeutic peptides?", "abstract": "Inflammation is the response of vascularized tissues to injury, irritation and infection. Nearly always, the inflammatory response is successfully resolved and, when necessary, a process of wound healing is initiated. Nowhere in the body is this homeostatic process more challenging than in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where the microbial flora sits in very close proximity to the mucosal immune system, separated only by an epithelial cell barrier. Delicate regulatory systems of the mucosal immune system determine mucosal permeability and response to bacterial flora, and aberrations in this system result in acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Examples of such are two commonly occurring inflammatory GI disorders: inflammatory bowel disease and postoperative ileus. Inflammatory bowel disease is the result of a chronic and excessive mucosal immune response, whereas postoperative ileus represents a transient condition of GI tract paralysis that is the result of an inflammatory response to abdominal surgery. The clinical management of both conditions is very challenging and depends heavily on the possibility of modulating the host immune response. In this brief report, we highlight the role of neuropeptides in GI physiology and immune regulation, discuss a recently discovered endogenous anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by the ChemR23 receptor and speculate on the therapeutic potential of peptides that bind G-protein-coupled receptors in the management of inflammation in the GI tract.", "journal": "Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology", "date": "2008-12-19", "authors": ["Wouter Jde Jonge", "David RGreaves"], "doi": "10.1586/17474124.2.6.741"}

To assess the microstructure of the nerve segment, myelin and Schwann cell morphology and fibrosis were examined. There were many Schwann cells with near normal morphology in the venous nerve segment and arterial nerve segment groups.

{"title": "Synergistic actions of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells in vascularizing bioengineered tissues.", "abstract": "Poor angiogenesis is a major road block for tissue repair. The regeneration of virtually all tissues is limited by angiogenesis, given the diffusion of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products is limited to a few hundred micrometers. We postulated that co-transplantation of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells improves angiogenesis of tissue repair and hence the outcome of regeneration. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by using bone as a model whose regeneration is impaired unless it is vascularized. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) were isolated from each of three healthy human bone marrow samples and reconstituted in a porous scaffold. MSCs were seeded in micropores of 3D calcium phosphate (CP) scaffolds, followed by infusion of gel-suspended CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. Co-transplantation of CD34(+) HSCs and CD34(-) MSCs in microporous CP scaffolds subcutaneously in the dorsum of immunocompromised mice yielded vascularized tissue. The average vascular number of co-transplanted CD34(+) and MSC scaffolds was substantially greater than MSC transplantation alone. Human osteocalcin was expressed in the micropores of CP scaffolds and was significantly increased upon co-transplantation of MSCs and CD34(+) cells. Human nuclear staining revealed the engraftment of transplanted human cells in vascular endothelium upon co-transplantation of MSCs and CD34(+) cells. Based on additional in vitro results of endothelial differentiation of CD34(+) cells by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we adsorbed VEGF with co-transplanted CD34(+) and MSCs in the microporous CP scaffolds in vivo, and discovered that vascular number and diameter further increased, likely owing to the promotion of endothelial differentiation of CD34(+) cells by VEGF.

In vitro three-component assays of this process are scarce. In this study, a complex three-dimensional spheroid model for in vitro studies of placental vasculogenesis with regard to cell-cell interactions between cytotrophoblasts (CTs), villous stromal cells and endothelial precursor cells was established. Microscopic and immunohistochemical analyses of the spheroids showed structural and differentiation patterns resembling the structure and differentiation of early placental chorionic villous tissue (in regard to the expression of multiple markers cytokeratin-7, vimentin, CD34, CD31). The authenticity of this model to in vivo events allowed investigation of placental vascular development and trophoblast invasion under physiological and pathological conditions. Particularly enhanced spheroidal expression of SDF-1alpha and its receptor CXCR4, the major chemokine system in embryonic vasculogenesis, in a low-oxygen environment was detected. In addition, our model confirmed previously described invasive phenotype of trophoblasts through collagen under low- (physiologic), but not high- (pathologic) oxygen concentrations. Therefore, the three-dimensional spheroid model consisting of major placental cell types proved to be an appropriate system to investigate early placental vessel development under both physiological and pathological conditions.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2008-12-17", "authors": ["NelliBaal", "RebeccaWidmer-Teske", "TimothyMcKinnon", "Klaus TPreissner", "Marek TZygmunt"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2008.126"}

Afterwards, 92 patients with suspected appendicitis enrolled in this study were prospectively evaluated and managed to follow a new protocol based on the clinical and radiological experiences. In this study, the ultrasonography was considered positive when the diameter of the wall of the appendix was larger than 7 mm and vascularization was increased or absent.\nOf these 92 patients, 54 patients underwent surgery while 38 were treated conservatively. Of the treated group, 12 patients had a perforated appendicitis, 3 had a gangrenous appendicitis, 36 patients demonstrated a phlegmonous appendix while 3 patients had a catarrhal appendix. Blood cell counts and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with appendicitis (P<0.05) and WBC and CRP levels were higher for patients with perforated appendicitis compared with patients with simple appendicitis (P<0.05). A CRP value higher than 17 mg/dL was a strong predictor for the presence of infection. Three patients of the conservative group underwent surgery later for recurrent abdominal pain (within 2 weeks); two had a catarrhal appendix while one patient had a normal appendix (confirmed by histology)\nPatients with suspected appendicitis could be managed with ultrasound, suggesting an early approach.

Infertility in endometriosis is related either to mechanical distortion of the reproductive truck or to various endometriosis-induced factors including hormones, cytokines and chemokines. Except from the anti-inflammatory treatments and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists that have been used for a long time to relief from pain, new treatments are targeted against either hormonal-mediated cell growth via inhibition of the metabolic pathway of estrogens and androgens or vascularization or even implantation of the endometrial engraftment.

In order to engineer viable bone grafts, one needs to understand the mechanisms of native bone development and fracture healing, as these processes should ideally guide the selection of optimal conditions for tissue culture and implantation. Engineered bone grafts have been shown to have capacity for osteogenesis, osteoconduction, osteoinduction and osteointegration - functional connection between the host bone and the graft. Cells from various anatomical sources in conjunction with scaffolds and osteogenic factors have been shown to form bone tissue in vitro. The use of bioreactor systems to culture cells on scaffolds before implantation further improved the quality of the resulting bone grafts. Animal studies confirmed the capability of engineered grafts to form bone and integrate with the host tissues. However, the vascularization of bone remains one of the hurdles that need to be overcome if clinically sized, fully viable bone grafts are to be engineered and implanted.

Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Abdominal subcutaneous tissue was used for staining, quantitative RT-PCR, and chemokine secretion assay.\nAT pO2 was lower in overweight/obese subjects than lean subjects (47 +/- 10.6 vs. 55 +/- 9.1 mmHg); however, this level of pO2 did not activate the classic hypoxia targets (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]). AT pO2 was negatively correlated with percent body fat (R = -0.50, P < 0.05). Compared with lean subjects, overweight/obese subjects had 44% lower capillary density and 58% lower VEGF, suggesting AT rarefaction (capillary drop out). This might be due to lower peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma1 and higher collagen VI mRNA expression, which correlated with AT pO2 (P < 0.05). Of clinical importance, AT pO2 negatively correlated with CD68 mRNA and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha secretion (R = -0.58, R = -0.79, P < 0.05), suggesting that lower AT pO2 could drive AT inflammation in obesity.\nAdipose tissue rarefaction might lie upstream of both low AT pO2 and inflammation in obesity.

{"title": "Tissue factor regulation by epidermal growth factor receptor and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions: effect on tumor initiation and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "ErbB oncogenes drive the progression of several human cancers. Our study shows that in human carcinoma (A431) and glioma (U373) cells, the oncogenic forms of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; including EGFRvIII) trigger the up-regulation of tissue factor (TF), the transmembrane protein responsible for initiating blood coagulation and signaling through interaction with coagulation factor VIIa. We show that A431 cancer cells in culture exhibit a uniform TF expression profile; however, these same cells in vivo exhibit a heterogeneous TF expression and show signs of E-cadherin inactivation, which is coupled with multilineage (epithelial and mesenchymal) differentiation. Blockade of E-cadherin in vitro, leads to the acquisition of spindle morphology and de novo expression of vimentin, features consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These changes were associated with an increase in EGFR-dependent TF expression, and with enhanced stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor production, particularly following cancer cell treatment with coagulation factor VIIa. In vivo, cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition exhibited an increased metastatic potential. Furthermore, injections of the TF-blocking antibody (CNTO 859) delayed the initiation of A431 tumors in immunodeficient mice, and reduced tumor growth, vascularization, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Collectively, our data suggest that TF is regulated by both oncogenic and differentiation pathways, and that it functions in tumor initiation, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Thus, TF could serve as a therapeutic target in EGFR-dependent malignancies.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2008-12-17", "authors": ["Chloe CMilsom", "Joanne LYu", "NigelMackman", "JohannMicallef", "G MarkAnderson", "AbhijitGuha", "Janusz WRak"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2067"}
{"title": "alphavbeta3 Integrin-dependent antiangiogenic activity of resveratrol stereoisomers.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is target for antineoplastic and chemopreventive therapies. The natural phytoalexin resveratrol is found in grapes and red wine as cis and trans stereoisomers. trans-Resveratrol shows antiangiogenic activity, but its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. Recently, trans-resveratrol has been shown to interact with the beta3 integrin subunit, raising the possibility that inhibition of endothelial alphavbeta3 integrin function may concur to its angiosuppressive activity. To get novel insights about the antiangiogenic activity of resveratrol, we compared cis- and trans-resveratrol stereoisomers for their effect on the angiogenesis process and endothelial alphavbeta3 integrin function. trans-Resveratrol inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and the repair of mechanically wounded endothelial cell monolayers. Also, it prevents endothelial cell sprouting in fibrin gel, collagen gel invasion, and morphogenesis on Matrigel. In vivo, trans-resveratrol inhibits vascularization of the chick embryo area vasculosa and murine melanoma B16 tumor growth and neovascularization. In all the assays, cis-resveratrol exerts a limited, if any, effect. In keeping with these observations, trans-resveratrol, but not cis-resveratrol, inhibits alphavbeta3 integrin-dependent endothelial cell adhesion and the recruitment of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged beta3 integrin in focal adhesion contacts. In conclusion, stereoisomery affects the antiangiogenic activity of resveratrol, the trans isomer being significantly more potent than the cis isoform. The different antiangiogenic potential of resveratrol stereoisomers is related, at least in part, to their different capacity to affect alphavbeta3 integrin function.

{"title": "Revascularization for complex intracranial aneurysms.", "abstract": "The modern management of intracranial aneurysms includes both constructive and deconstructive strategies to eliminate the aneurysm from the circulation. Both microsurgical and endovascular techniques are used to achieve this goal. Although most aneurysms can be eliminated from the circulation with simple clip reconstruction and/or coil insertion, some require revascularization techniques to enhance tolerance of temporary arterial occlusion during clipping of the aneurysm neck or to enable proximal occlusion or trapping. In fact, the importance of revascularization techniques has grown because of the need for complex reconstructions when endovascular therapies fail. Moreover, the safety and feasibility of bypass have progressed due to advances in neuroanesthesia, technological innovations, and ~ 5 decades of accumulating wisdom by bypass practitioners. Cerebral revascularization strategies become necessary in select patients who possess challenging vascular aneurysms due to size, shape, location, intramural thrombus, atherosclerotic plaques, aneurysm type (for example, dissecting aneurysms), vessels arising from the dome, or poor collateral vascularization when parent artery or branch occlusion is required. These techniques are used to prevent cerebral ischemia and subsequent clinical sequelae. Bypass techniques should be considered in cases in which balloon test occlusion demonstrates inadequate cerebral blood flow and in which there is a need for Hunterian ligation, trapping, or prolonged temporary occlusion.

The antiproliferative effect of hyperforin was studied on 16 human- and 7 rat cell lines and on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). Intratumoral MVD did not show significant association with infiltration for any of these cell types. In the case of peritumoral reactive cell densities analyzed in the whole patient population, significant correlation was found with CD3 + T-cell density. This association was stronger in melanomas >4.0 mm and in visceral metastatic tumors. In these subgroups similar phenomenon was observed for CD8 + cells. We found significant correlation of MVD with CD68 + macrophage density only in the highest thickness category, and weak associations with B-cell and dendritic cell infiltration in visceral metastatic cases. MVD did not vary significantly in tumors categorized according to thickness, location, ulceration or histological type. However, both intratumoral MVD and macrophage infiltration were significantly higher in male patients compared to females. Hyperforin inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In vitro, it blocked capillary formation of HDMEC on a complex extracellular matrix. Furthermore, hyperforin reduced proliferation of HDMEC, without displaying toxic effects or inducing apoptosis. In Wistar rats hyperforin inhibited tumor growth and reduced tumor vascularization. Since the net outcome of the enrichment in tumor-infiltrating host cells and in tumor vascularization cannot be easily predicted, further clinicopathological studies are needed on human skin melanoma patients.

This study characterizes the retinal vascular abnormalities of NEMO-deficient mice, and compares this phenotype to known features of human IP. Nineteen heterozygous NEMO-deficient female mice, ages ranging from post-natal day 8 (P-8) through 6.5 months of life, were studied. Eyes were sectioned and stained either whole or as retinal flat mounts after incubation for enzyme histochemical demonstration of ADPase, which labels the vasculature. With maturation, retinal arteriolar abnormalities became evident at 3 months of age. Global assessment of the retinal vasculature with ADPase staining showed increased vascular tortuosity. Microscopic examination of sections of ADPase-incubated retinas revealed arteriolar luminal narrowing due to endothelial cell hypertrophy and increased basement membrane deposition. Venous morphology was normal. This study characterized the histological retinal phenotype of heterozygous NEMO-deficient female mice.

{"title": "Platelets influence vascularized organ transplants from start to finish.", "abstract": "This review relates the basic functions of platelets to specific aspects of organ allograft rejection. Platelet activation can occur in the donor or recipient before transplantation as well as during antibody- and cell-mediated rejection. Biopsies taken during organ procurement from cadaver donors have documented that activated platelets are attached to vascular endothelial cells or leukocytes. In addition, many patients waiting for transplants have activated platelets due to the diseases that lead to organ failure or as a result of interventions used to support patients before and during transplantation. The contribution of platelets to hyperacute rejection of both allografts and xenografts is well recognized. Intravascular aggregates of platelets can also be prominent in experimental and clinical transplants that undergo acute antibody or cell-mediated rejection. In acute rejection, platelets can recruit mononuclear cells by secretion of chemokines. After contact, monocytes, macrophages and T cells interact with platelets through receptor/ligand pairs, including P-selectin/PSGL-1 and CD40/CD154. There is a potential for therapy to inhibit platelet mediated immune stimulation, but it is counterbalanced by the need to maintain coagulation in the perioperative period.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2008-12-11", "authors": ["A DKirk", "C NMorrell", "W MBaldwin"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02473.x"}

Bulk tumor expansion is modeled by individual cell motility in a density-dependent diffusion process. This model is implemented in the context of an in vivo system, the tumor cord. We investigate numerically microscale density distributions of different cell classes and macroscale whole tumor growth rates as functions of the strength of transitions between classes. Our results indicate that the total tumor growth follows a classical von Bertalanffy growth profile, as many in vivo tumors are observed to do. This provides a quick validation for the model hypotheses. The microscale and macroscale properties are both sensitive to fluctuations in the transition parameters, and grossly adopt one of two phenotypic profiles based on their parameter regime. We analyze these profiles and use the observations to classify parameter regimes by their phenotypes. This classification yields a novel hypothesis for the early evolutionary selection of the metastatic phenotype by selecting against less motile cells which grow to higher densities and may therefore induce local collapse of the vascular network.", "journal": "Bulletin of mathematical biology", "date": "2008-12-11", "authors": ["Craig JThalhauser", "TejasSankar", "Mark CPreul", "YangKuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11538-008-9372-8"}

However, current success rates are low due to progressive graft failure in the long term and inability to monitor graft development in vivo. Other limitations include the necessity of initial invasive surgery and continued immunosuppressive therapy. We report an alternative transplantation strategy with the potential to overcome these problems. This technique involves transplantation of embryonic pancreatic tissue into recipients' subcutaneous space, eliminating the need for invasive surgery and associated risks. Current results in mouse models of type 1 diabetes show that embryonic pancreatic transplants in the subcutaneous space can normalize blood glucose homeostasis and achieve extensive endocrine differentiation and vascularization. Furthermore, modern imaging techniques such as two-photon excitation microscopy (TPEM) can be employed to monitor transplants through the intact skin in a completely noninvasive manner.

{"title": "[Ocular changes in preeclampsia].", "abstract": "The pregnancy is associated with modifications involving multiple systems and organs, including the eye. The retinal vascular changes are present in 30-100% of the PE cases. The most frequent ocular modification is the vasoconstriction of the retinal arterioles. The exudative retinal detachment is a rare cause (under 1%) of visual loss in the PE-E syndrome, being produced by the involvement of the choroidal vascularization. Most cases of blindness during pregnancy have been determined by cortical, occipital anomalies, the used terminology in these circumstances being cortical blindness. The pathogenesis of the Purtscher retinopathy is the embolism of the retinal arterioles, by leucocytic aggregation, as a response to the activation of the complement. The evaluation of the ophthalmic arterial flow by eco Doppler might offer new perspectives regarding the understanding of the physiopathology, the diagnosis and the quantification of the PE severity. The decrease of the IP values and the increase of the median velocity in the ophthalmic artery in pregnant women with PE, suggest a hyperperfusion process and the decrease of the vascular resistances at the level of the orbital vessels, but also in the CNS. In the severe forms of PE, the increase of the impedance of the orbital vessels has been noted. The described vascular changes cannot disappear completely 6 weeks after birth; a residual arteriolar constriction might persist, as a permanent stigma of the PE.

{"title": "Islet cell transplantation.", "abstract": "The transplantation of human islets has come a long way since the first diabetic person became insulin independent in 1989. The advent of a steroid-free immunosuppressive protocol in 2000 resulted in most recipients becoming insulin independent and remaining so for a year. However, beta-cell function declines thereafter. Strategies to enhance the islet mass transplanted and preserve beta-cell function are necessary.\nThis review covers recent advances in determining the selection of appropriate enzymes for islet isolation, use of pancreases from heart-dead donors and techniques for predicting the functional capacity of isolated islets prior to transplantation. Changing the transplantation site away from the liver, where many islets are destroyed by an inflammatory process, is reviewed, and the possibility of seeding islets onto three-dimensional biodegradable scaffolds discussed. A method of preventing apoptosis of the beta cells prior to transplantation is detailed, as is the beneficial effect of using exenatide, after transplantation. Novel techniques to image islets are discussed, and this requires the labelling of the islets prior to implantation. Enhancing the vascularization of islets is shown to enhance functional outcomes.

{"title": "Prevention of skin flap necrosis by estradiol involves reperfusion of a protected vascular network.", "abstract": "Although 17beta-estradiol (E2) is protective in experimental models of myocardial and brain ischemia, its effect on skin ischemia remains unknown. Here, we assessed the protective effect of E2 in a mouse model of skin ischemia, mimicking the surgery of skin flaps. Whereas necrosis appeared in the half portion of the skin flap within 1 week after surgery in ovariectomized mice, it was reduced up to 10-fold when mice were pretreated with E2, at least 3 days before the surgery. The beneficial effect of E2 appeared to be attributable to an increase in skin survival, revealed by measuring viability of ex vivo explants and enhancement of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression in vivo. This protective effect on the skin contributed to the protection of the vascular network and facilitated reperfusion, which was found to be accelerated in ovariectomized E2-treated mice, whereas hemorrhages were observed in untreated mice. E2 also increased expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 isoforms in the skin and circulating vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum. Finally, this protective effect of E2 was abolished in estrogen receptor-deficient mice (ERalpha(-/-)) but maintained in chimeric mice reconstituted with ERalpha-deficient bone marrow, indicating dispensable action of E2 in bone marrow-derived cells. This protective effect of E2 was mimicked by treatment with tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that E2 exerts a major preventive effect of skin flap necrosis through a prevention of ischemic-induced skin lesions, including those of the vascular network, which contributes to accelerate the reperfusion of the skin flap.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2008-12-09", "authors": ["C\u00e9line EToutain", "LaurentBrouchet", "IsabelleRaymond-Letron", "PatriciaVicendo", "HortenseBerg\u00e8s", "JulieFavre", "Marie-Jos\u00e9Fouque", "Andr\u00e9eKrust", "Anne-MarieSchmitt", "PierreChambon", "PierreGourdy", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisArnal", "Fran\u00e7oiseLenfant"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182410"}

Our supposition is that the timed delivery of an anti-angiogenic factor in cartilage tissue engineering may facilitate the formation of hyaline cartilage by inducing the regression of vascularization. To this end our overall goal is to prepare an off-the-shelf scaffold containing the gene for a potent anti-angiogenic factor. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of a type I/III collagen scaffold for the non-viral transfection of marrow stromal cells (MSCs, also referred to as mesenchymal stem cells) with the plasmid encoding endostatin. Caprine MSCs were transfected by the naked plasmid alone and plasmid incorporated into a cationic lipid complex in three experiments: 1) cells were transfected in monolayer; 2) monolayer-transfected cells were grown in a collagen sponge-like scaffold; and 3) non-transfected cells were grown in a collagen scaffold containing the naked plasmid and endostatin lipoplex. Independent variables were the passage number of the cells and the plasmid loading. The amount of endostatin released by the cells into the medium was measured using an ELISA. The results demonstrated the overexpression of endostatin by MSCs growing in the endostatin lipoplex-supplemented collagen scaffolds. Endostatin released by the cell-seeded scaffolds reached a peak of 13ng/ml for scaffolds incorporating as little as 20mug of plasmid, at the 3-day collection period ending 5 days post-seeding. The accumulated endostatin synthesis over a 2-week period began to achieve what may be a therapeutic level.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha is the critical transcription factor that regulates adaptive responses to hypoxia. HIF-1alpha stability and function is regulated by oxygen-dependent soluble hydroxylases targeting critical proline and asparaginyl residues. Here we show that hyperglycemia complexly affects both HIF-1alpha stability and activation, resulting in suppression of expression of HIF-1 target genes essential for wound healing both in vitro and in vivo. However, by blocking HIF-1alpha hydroxylation through chemical inhibition, it is possible to reverse this negative effect of hyperglycemia and to improve the wound healing process (i.e., granulation, vascularization, epidermal regeneration, and recruitment of endothelial precursors). Local adenovirus-mediated transfer of two stable HIF constructs demonstrated that stabilization of HIF-1alpha is necessary and sufficient for promoting wound healing in a diabetic environment. Our findings outline the necessity to develop specific hydroxylase inhibitors as therapeutic agents for chronic diabetes wounds.

The aim of the present study was therefore to develop an animal model that allows continuous monitoring of the microcirculation during skin graft healing.\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue were removed from the back of dorsal skinfold chamber preparations in mice, leaving one layer of striated muscle and subcutaneous tissue as a wound bed (n = 5). A corresponding full-thickness skin graft was harvested from the groin and sutured into the defect in the back of the chamber. To study graft healing, repetitive intravital microscopy was performed during the first 10 days after engraftment.\nCapillary widening in the wound bed appeared at day 1 after grafting and increased until day 4. Capillary buds and sprouts first appeared at day 2. Blood filling of autochthonous graft capillaries occurred at day 3, resulting in almost complete restoration of the original skin microcirculation on day 5. This was achieved by interconnections between the microvasculature of the wound bed and the skin graft through a temporary angiogenic response. In principle, angiogenic blood vessel growth originated in the wound bed and was directed toward the graft.\nThis new model allows for repetitive analysis of the microcirculation during skin graft healing.

{"title": "The semi-open approach to the gracilis muscle flap: aesthetic refinements in gracilis muscle harvest.", "abstract": "The gracilis muscle flap is certainly among the most versatile sources of vascularized tissue available for microsurgical reconstruction. However, the aesthetic appearance of the resultant scar has frequently been a source of dissatisfaction. Various minimal invasive techniques have been proposed, all of which aim to reduce scar formation. Drawbacks of endoscopic techniques, however, include a steep learning curve as well the need for special technical equipment. A semi-open approach without endoscopic assistance is presented, characterized by a short transverse incision in the groin area without a counterincision distally. This technique was performed in six patients (mean age, 48.8 years). Mean incision length was 8.8 cm, and average muscle harvesting time was 49 minutes. We suggest the semi-open approach to the gracilis muscle flap because it does not require special instruments and training and is characterized by easy performance and a short incision in the inconspicuous groin area with resultant better cosmesis.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2008-12-03", "authors": ["ArashMomeni", "HolgerBannasch"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0028-1104560"}

A variety of vascularized bone grafts can be used. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two types of vascularized bone graft--a distal radial pedicle graft and a free vascularized medial femoral condyle graft--in the treatment of scaphoid waist nonunions associated with proximal pole osteonecrosis and carpal collapse.\nA retrospective review was conducted at two institutions to identify all patients with a scaphoid waist nonunion associated with an avascular proximal pole and carpal collapse. Between January 1994 and June 2006, twenty-two such nonunions were identified in twenty-two patients. Ten were treated with a distal radial pedicle vascularized graft and twelve, with a free vascularized medial femoral condyle graft. Patient demographics were similar between the groups, and the duration of follow-up averaged twelve months. Union was determined with use of plain radiographs and computed tomography or trispiral tomograms. In addition, carpal angles, time to union, union rates, and complications were recorded.\nFour of the ten nonunions treated with the distal radial pedicle graft healed, at a median of nineteen weeks, and all twelve nonunions treated with the free medial femoral condyle graft healed, at a median of thirteen weeks. The rate of union was significantly higher (p = 0.005) and the median time to healing was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) for the nonunions treated with the medial femoral condyle graft.\nA vascularized interposition graft from the medial femoral condyle is the recommended vascularized bone graft for the surgical treatment of scaphoid waist nonunion with avascularity of the proximal pole and carpal collapse.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Needless to say, the aim of cortical bone block and vascularized bone flap transfer is the transplantation of bony tissue of its own. On the other hand, the main objective of PCBM grafting is the transplant of osteogenic stem cells derived from uncommitted marrow mesenchymal cells. After PCBM grafting, active new bone formation occurs from osteogenic stem cells followed by bone remodeling and replacement of host bone. This process means that PCBM grafting is the method of bone regeneration that is based on in vivo tissue engineering.

While many molecular signals that promote vascular development have been identified, little is known about suppressors of this process. In higher vertebrates, including birds and mammals, the vascular network forms throughout the embryonic disk with the exception of a region along the midline. We have previously shown that the notochord is responsible for the generation and maintenance of the avascular midline and that BMP antagonists expressed by this embryonic tissue, including Noggin and Chordin, can mimic this inhibitory role. Here we report that the notochord suppresses the generation of ECs from the mesoderm both in vivo and in vitro. We also report that the notochord diminishes the ability of mature ECs to organize into a primitive plexus. Furthermore, Noggin mimics notochord-based inhibition by preventing mesodermal EC generation and mature EC network formation. These findings suggest that the mesoderm surrounding the midline is competent to give rise to ECs and to form blood vessels, but that notochord derived-BMP antagonists suppress EC differentiation and maturation processes leading to inhibition of midline vessel formation.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2008-12-02", "authors": ["MichaelBressan", "PatriciaDavis", "JohnTimmer", "DorisHerzlinger", "TakashiMikawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.10.045"}

US elastography (USE) is a powerful new diagnostic tool that assesses hardness as an indicator of malignancy in thyroid nodules. USE has high specificity and sensitivity independent of the nodule size, and this predictive value is maintained in follicular lesions. Available data suggest that USE is the best available non-invasive tool comparable to fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for the evaluation of thyroid nodules, provided that the nodule is solid and devoid of coarse calcifications. Thus, conventional US retains its importance for selecting nodules in which USE is predictive.

From January 2003 to February 2004, we evaluated 200 patients and one of lobular carcinoma in situ was excluded from the malignant category. One hundred and ninety-nine subjects were enrolled. All subjects with one or more breast masses were studied with 3D power Doppler US nonharmonic and harmonic technologies. Sixteen of 199 subjects were excluded because masses exceeded 3 cm limit of our US probe's footprint (n = 5) or no harmonic Doppler information (n = 11). A total of 97 benign and 86 pathologically proven malignant breast tumor images were analyzed. 3D power Doppler US imaging was performed using a Voluson730 US system. Three histogram indices, the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization-flow index (VFI), on both nonharmonic and harmonic images were calculated for the intratumor and for shells with an outside thickness of 3 mm surrounding the breast lesion. A multilayer perception (MLP) neural network classifier used the vascularity indices to determine whether the breast tumors are benign or malignant. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are performed to estimate the diagnostic performances for nonharmonic and harmonic methods. ROC curve analysis used overall age, volume, VI, FI and VFI for both intratumor and shells with an outside thickness of 3 mm surrounding the breast lesions in nonharmonic US and THI.

The purpose of our study was to analyze the potential value of pre- and post-treatment contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for assessing the outcome of SUFE and for posttreatment follow-up.\nWe studied twelve women undergoing SUFE for uterine fibroids. In those with multiple fibroids, only the three largest were considered in this study. A total of 21 lesions (size range 3.5-9.0\u00a0cm, mean 5.2\u00a0cm) were examined. Each myoma was examined immediately before and after SUFE (while the patient was still in the angiography room) with transabdominal CEUS performed after intravenous administration of a single bolus of contrast agent. The follow-up protocol included CEUS evaluation one month after treatment and CEUS plus dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) studies six months after treatment.\nIn 20/21 cases, postembolization CEUS revealed total fibroid devascularization. The remaining lesion (in a woman with multiple lesions) showed persistent vascularization after SUFE. These findings were all consistent with angiographic data. No recurrences were observed during the six-month follow-up. One patient reported the reappearance of symptoms 18 months after SUFE, and CEUS showed the persistence of intralesional vascularization.\nCEUS is effective for assessing the completeness of vascular occlusion following SUFE for uterine fibroids.

Lo scopo di questo lavoro \u00e8 di descrivere i reperti ottenuti tramite CEUS prima e dopo SUFE e di stabilire se la CEUS pu\u00f2 giocare un ruolo nella valutazione dei risultati e nel follow up di questa procedura. MATERIALI E METODI: Abbiamo valutato tramite CEUS 21 miomi in 12 pazienti immediatamente prima e dopo la SUFE direttamente in sala angiografica. A causa della dimensione dei miomi (range 3.7\u20139.0\u00a0cm, media 5.2\u00a0cm), tutte le valutazioni sono state effettuate per via trans-addominale. In caso di miomatosi multipla, abbiamo valutato solo i tre miomi pi\u00f9 grandi. In tutti i pazienti, \u00e8 stato iniettato un singolo bolo di mezzo di contrasto. Il protocollo di follow up ha previsto una valutazione CEUS dopo un mese ed una valutazione con CEUS e risonanza magnetica (RM) dopo sei mesi. RISULTATI: In 20/21 casi, la CEUS ha dimostrato una devascolarizzazione totale delle lesioni immediatamente dopo l'embolizzazione. In un caso di lesioni multiple, un fibroma ha mantenuto la propria vascolarizzazione. Questi risultati sono coerenti con i reperti angiografici. Non \u00e8 stata osservata alcuna recidiva di malattia durante il follow up. Una paziente ha riferito la ricomparsa dei sintomi dopo 18 mesi dall'esecuzione della procedura; in questo caso, la CEUS ha dimostrato nuovamente la presenza di vascolarizzazione intralesionale.

Preoperative evaluation included CT chest, MRI. Limb sparing surgical resection was done including intraarticular or extraarticular wide resection of the tumor. Bone defect was reconstructed with fusion shoulder using free vascularized fibular graft (FFFG) in 11 patients and pedicled lateral scapular crest graft (PLSCG) in 8 patients and mobile shoulder reconstruction using proximal humerus prosthesis in 13 patients. Those patients were followed-up at regular interval to detect bone union and complications related to bone flaps or prosthesis. Functional results were assessed for every patient after one year postoperatively.\nThe median age of the patients was 21 years and the follow-up period ranged from 19 months to 92 months. Postoperative resection margins were negative in all cases. The mean length of the resected humerus was 13cm. The mean operative time for prosthesis cases was 3.5 hours and that for FVFG was 6.5 hours and was 5 hours for PLSCG cases. The mean time of bone union proximally and distally for FVFG and PLSCG was 4.2 and 5.5 months accordingly. At 1 year follow-up, the functional results for the three reconstructive procedures were nearly the same with a mean functional score for FVFG cases was 73%, for PLSCG cases was 68% and was 71% for prosthesis cases. Hand and elbow functions were preserved in all types of reconstruction. The range of shoulder abduction and flexion was grossly limited with prosthesis cases while it showed marked improvement with fusion by FVFG and PLSCG. Complications for prosthesis cases were one case proximal migration and one case posterior sublaxation. Complications of bone flaps were nonunion of one end in 2 cases of PLSCG and one case of FVFG. Limb shortening was seen in 32 cases with PLSCG.\nSummarizing our experience in this small study, we can state that, limb sparing surgical resection of tumors of the proximal humerus is effective in local tumor control and preserving hand and elbow movements. MSTS functional score of the limb after reconstruction and shoulder fusion with FVFG or PLSCG is nearly the same as mobile shoulder reconstruction with endoprosthesis. Shoulder range of movement was grossly limited with prosthesis replacement while a wider range of movement was obtained with shoulder fusion. Pedicled lateral scapular crest graft is able to bridge defects only up to 12cm whereas the fibula can replace a longer defect. Selection between those reconstructive options should be individualized and is based on the age, the length of defect, the type of resection, intraarticular or extraarticular, preservation of deltoid and axillary nerve, the prognosis of the tumor.\nProximal humerus tumors - Reconstruction - Limb salvage.", "journal": "Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute", "date": "2008-12-01", "authors": ["MagdyEl-Sherbiny"], "doi": null}

HUVEC-coated dextran beads were suspended in fibrin gel with human glioma cells on top. The number of sprouts and the length of the processes were measured. HUVEC can be induced to form sprouts and longer processes with lumens, in co-culture with glioma cells that secrete VEGF. Addition of exogenous VEGF enhances this effect. In the absence of glioma cells, many single HUVEC migrate away from the beads, without significant tubule formation. Hypoxia further stimulated sprout formation by 50-100%.

The human cytomegalovirus encodes a functional homolog of the potent anti-inflammatory human cytokine interleukin-10 (cmvIL-10). We hypothesized that cmvIL-10 downmodulates the FBR, impairing degradation of biomaterial. We studied the effect of cmvIL-10 on the FBR to subcutaneously implanted hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked dermal sheep collagen (HDSC) discs in rats. CmvIL-10 impaired macrophage influx, vascularization and ingrowth into the discs up to 21 days. It also impaired the formation of giant cells and the degradation of HDSC. At day 10, deposited fibrin fibers were still present in cmvIL-10 discs. Impaired collagenase activity coincided with the impaired HDSC degradation.

{"title": "Generation of a functional and durable vascular niche by the adenoviral E4ORF1 gene.", "abstract": "Vascular cells contribute to organogenesis and tumorigenesis by producing unknown factors. Primary endothelial cells (PECs) provide an instructive platform for identifying factors that support stem cell and tumor homeostasis. However, long-term maintenance of PECs requires stimulation with cytokines and serum, resulting in loss of their angiogenic properties. To circumvent this hurdle, we have discovered that the adenoviral E4ORF1 gene product maintains long-term survival and facilitates organ-specific purification of PECs, while preserving their vascular repertoire for months, in serum/cytokine-free cultures. Lentiviral introduction of E4ORF1 into human PECs (E4ORF1(+) ECs) increased the long-term survival of these cells in serum/cytokine-free conditions, while preserving their in vivo angiogenic potential for tubulogenesis and sprouting. Although E4ORF1, in the absence of mitogenic signals, does not induce proliferation of ECs, stimulation with VEGF-A and/or FGF-2 induced expansion of E4ORF1(+) ECs in a contact-inhibited manner. Indeed, VEGF-A-induced phospho MAPK activation of E4ORF1(+) ECs is comparable with that of naive PECs, suggesting that the VEGF receptors remain functional upon E4ORF1 introduction. E4ORF1(+) ECs inoculated in implanted Matrigel plugs formed functional, patent, humanized microvessels that connected to the murine circulation. E4ORF1(+) ECs also incorporated into neo-vessels of human tumor xenotransplants and supported serum/cytokine-free expansion of leukemic and embryonal carcinoma cells. E4ORF1 augments survival of PECs in part by maintaining FGF-2/FGF-R1 signaling and through tonic Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt, thereby activating the mTOR and NF-kappaB pathways. Therefore, E4ORF1(+) ECs establish an Akt-dependent durable vascular niche not only for expanding stem and tumor cells but also for interrogating the roles of vascular cells in regulating organ-specific vascularization and tumor neo-angiogenesis.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2008-11-28", "authors": ["MarcoSeandel", "Jason MButler", "HidekiKobayashi", "Andrea THooper", "Ian AWhite", "FanZhang", "Eva LVertes", "MarikoKobayashi", "YanZhang", "Sergey VShmelkov", "Neil RHackett", "SinaRabbany", "Julie LBoyer", "ShahinRafii"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0805980105"}

{"title": "Covalent surface heparinization potentiates porous polyurethane scaffold vascularization.", "abstract": "Porous scaffolds play an integral role in many tissue-engineering approaches, and the ability to improve vascularization, without eliciting an excessive inflammatory response, would constitute an important step towards achieving long-term healing and function of devices made from these materials. After having previously optimized the dimensional requirements of the well-defined pores, the present study aimed at a further shift from inflammation to vascularization via surface immobilization with heparin. Porous polyurethane disks were produced to contain well-defined pores (147 +/- 2 microm) with abundant interconnecting windows (67 +/- 2 microm). After heparinization via copolymer grafting and amination to contain 32 microg of heparin, the modification appeared as a uniform layer on all exposed surfaces, with no signs of pore obliteration or significant changes in pore size. After 28 days implantation in a rat subcutaneous model, the scaffolds were assessed for vascularization/arteriolization and inflammation using CD31/actin and ED-1 staining, respectively. Heparinization resulted in a significant increase in vascularization: capillaries increased by 62% in number (66.2 +/- 0.8 to 107.3 +/- 1.4 vessels/mm( 2); p < 0.03) and 56% in total area (0.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.02%; p<0.02). Arteriolization also increased in absolute terms (200% in number; p<0.03), but did not change significantly when normalized to capillary number. Heparinization did not significantly affect the inflammatory response at this time-point, as quantified by ED-1 positive macrophage and foreign body giant cell (FBGC) content. Thus, the in vivo vascularization of porous scaffolds could be increased without concomitant increase in the inflammatory response by employing a simple surface modification technique.

The results showed the dense vascular network occurred in subpleural area in newborn yak. Subpleural vascular network was found in most of observed areas, while the sparse vascular network crept onto the subpleural network in some fields of view. The subpleural microvessels and their branches made up of the subpleural microvascular network. According to the branching sequence of vessels, the subpleural arterioles could be divided into four grades: the arteriole, terminal arteriole, precapillary arteriole and capillary. The subpleural capillary network in the local area could be classified into three different forms, including sheetlike vascular network, wrinkled vascular network and weblike vascular network.

When rat BMSCs were seeded onto a three-dimensional (3-D) tubular scaffold engineered from topographically aligned type I collagen fibers and cultured either in vasculogenic or non-vasculogenic media for 7, 14, 21 or 28 days, the maturation and co-differentiation into endothelial and/or smooth muscle cell lineages were observed. Phenotypic induction of these substrate-grown cells was assayed at transcript level by real-time PCR and at protein level by confocal microscopy. In the present study, the observed upregulation of transcripts coding for vascular phenotypic markers is reminiscent of an in vivo expression pattern. Immunolocalization of vasculogenic lineage-associated markers revealed typical expression patterns of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. These endothelial cells exhibited high metabolism of acetylated low-density lipoprotein. In addition to the induced monolayers of endothelial cells, the presence of numerous microvascular capillary-like structures was observed throughout the construct. At the level of scanning electron microscopy, smooth-walled cylindrical tube-like structures with smooth muscle cells and/or pericytes attached to its surface were elucidated.

The aim of our study was to measure vancomycin and teicoplanin concentrations in infected human bone under steady-state conditions and verify their relationship with inflammatory markers, patient demographic characteristics and pharmacodynamic microbiological markers.\nTwenty-seven adult orthopaedic patients undergoing surgical debridement for septic pseudoarthrosis of the tibia and receiving either intravenous vancomycin (Vancocina) 1 g twice daily) or teicoplanin (Targosid) 10 mg/kg/day) were studied from January 2004 to January 2008. Plasma and bone specimens were simultaneously collected during surgery for pharmacokinetic and microbiological assays at a variable interval after antimicrobial administration. Bone samples were dissected into cortical and cancellous bone, cleaned of soft tissues, crushed and eluted into phosphate buffer. Necrotic samples and sequestra were not analysed.Plasma and bone antimicrobial concentrations were measured by a validated method of high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, and bone/plasma concentration ratios were calculated. Cortical and cancellous bone area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24 hours (AUC(24)) values were measured by the linear-log trapezoidal rule, using WinNonlin) software, and were compared with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the infecting agents.\nFor vancomycin, the mean +/- SD concentrations were 2.66 +/- 1.2 mg/L in cortical bone and 11.53 +/- 7.8 mg/L in cancellous bone (corresponding to 20.67% and 89.39% of intraoperative plasma concentrations), and the mean +/- SD tissue AUC(24) values were 55.15 +/- 25.26 h . mg/L for cortical bone and 299.16 +/- 299.54 h . mg/L for cancellous bone.

Vancomycin bone penetration was slightly higher than with teicoplanin, but the difference was not statistically significant. Higher bone concentrations were observed with higher inflammatory markers, possibly as a result of increased vascularization and vascular permeability under inflammatory conditions. Bone concentrations over the MIC and AUC/MIC ratios suggested that both glycopeptides achieve a satisfactory pharmacokinetic exposure in the cancellous bone, as far as Gram-positive pathogens are concerned.

Therefore, the search for clinically relevant sources of vasculogenic cells and the subsequent development of experimental models of vasculogenesis is of utmost importance. Here, we describe a methodology adapted from the Matrigel plug assay to deliver human blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and mature smooth muscle cells (SMCs) subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. One week after implantation, an extensive microvascular network composed of the human EPCs and SMCs is formed within the Matrigel. The presence of human EPC-lined lumens containing host erythrocytes can be seen throughout the implants indicating not only the formation (de novo) of a vascular network, but also the development of functional anastomoses with the host circulatory system. This is a very versatile assay that allows (1) dialing the final microvessel density by varying either the total number of cells in the original cell suspension or the ratio between EPCs and SMCs, (2) studying the effect of substituting another type of perivascular cell for mature SMCs or another type of endothelial cell, (3) tracking each of the implanted cell types by labeling (e.g., GFP tagging) prior to implantation, and (4) studying the effect of genetically modifying the cells prior to implantation. Additionally, this assay is relatively simple to perform and it does not require an incision or surgical procedure.

{"title": "Oxygen generating scaffolds for enhancing engineered tissue survival.", "abstract": "One of the continued challenges in engineering clinically applicable tissues is the establishment of vascularization upon implantation in vivo. Although the effectiveness of an enhanced angiogenic response using various growth factors has been demonstrated in many tissue systems, the rate of angiogenesis could not be accelerated. In this study we investigated whether incorporating oxygen generating biomaterials into tissue engineered constructs would provide a sustained oxygen release over an extended period of time. We examined whether oxygen generating biomaterials are able to maintain cell viability while also maintaining structural integrity of a 3-D construct. Calcium peroxide-based oxygen generating particles were incorporated into 3-D scaffolds of Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The scaffolds were designed to generate oxygen over the course of 10 days and simultaneously maintain sufficient mechanical integrity. Scaffolds containing oxygen generating materials maintained elevated levels of oxygen when incubated under hypoxic conditions. Further, these biomaterials were able to extend cell viability growth under hypoxic conditions. These findings indicate that the use of oxygen generating biomaterials may allow for increased cell survivability while neovascularization is being established after implantation. Such scaffolds may play an important role in tissue engineering where currently oxygen diffusion limits the engineering of large tissue implants.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2008-11-21", "authors": ["Se HeangOh", "Catherine LWard", "AnthonyAtala", "James JYoo", "Benjamin SHarrison"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.065"}

In vivo assessment of new vessel formation in islet grafts has been poorly documented. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether neovascularization was detectable in vivo in a Feridex-labeled murine syngeneic subcapsular islet mass using DCE MRI over 180 days. Subcapsular transplants could be visualized at post-transplant days three, seven, 14, and 28 using T2-weighted MRI and at post-transplant day 180 by immunohistochemistry. Injection of the contrast agent gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA for DCE at three, seven, and 14 days showed increased signal in the transplant area consistent with new vessel formation. Areas under contrast enhancement curves suggested peak angiogenesis at 14 days. At 180 days, there was no observable change in signal intensity after contrast injection suggesting established vascularization or islet mass reduction. Immunohistochemistry confirmed MRI and DCE findings. These data suggest that islet angiogenesis occurs early after transplantation and is likely established after one month of transplantation.

However, there are no reported candidate agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The authors' published experimental studies have shown that Epimedium-derived flavonoids possess an anti-ON effect. Further, the authors have recently identified a small molecule Icaritin as an intestinal metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids.\nThe present study was to evaluate the prevention effect of the available semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin on steroid-associated ON development in a rabbit model.\nAfter receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON, eighty-four male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into the following three daily oral administration groups, including low dose Icaritin group (L-ICT; n=28; 5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), high dose Icaritin group (H-ICT; n=28; 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), and control vehicle group (CON; n=28). Before and after induction, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index. Meanwhile, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation, endothelium injury, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte injury index, while marrow samples were quantified for adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell by in vitro culture and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) protein expression by western blot. At baseline, week 1 and 2 post-induction, 4, 8 and 16 rabbits in each group were sacrificed, respectively. After sacrifice, femora were dissected for micro-CT-based micro-angiography, followed by histological examination of ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis, extravascular fat-cell and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) localized expression.\nThe ON incidence in the L-ICT and H-ICT groups was both significantly lower than that in the CON group (p<0.05 for both). The ON incidence in the H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (p<0.05). A significant decrease in the vascularization index and a significant increase in the permeability index seen in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. Reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units was more rarely found in the H-ICT group than in the L-ICT group. Regarding intravascular thrombosis, a significant increase in the thrombotic vessel count, endothelium injury index, coagulation index, and a significant decrease in both the fibrinolysis and oxidative stress index in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. For extravascular lipid-deposition, a significant increase in the fat cell area fraction, adipogenic potential index, PPARgamma expression and lipid-transportation index in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Regarding safety, the hepatocyte injury index did not show significant change from baseline in any group.\nIcaritin, a novel semisynthesized small molecule with osteoprotective potential, exerts dose-dependent effect on reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition.

The viability of the transplanted cells is limited by the rate of neovascularization in the chamber. A Nox2-containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase is thought to have a critical role in ischaemic angiogenesis. In this study we investigated whether NADPH oxidase is involved in the neovascularization process in the tissue-engineering chamber. New blood vessels originating from the venous and the arterial ends of the loop could be identified after 3 days, and the vessel density (by lectin staining) peaked after 7 days and was maintained for at least 14 days. This was accompanied by granulation tissue formation and concomitant increase in the mRNA level of Nox4 NADPH oxidase. Although the total level of Nox2 mRNA in the chamber tissue decreased from day 3 to day 7, immunohistochemistry identified a strong expression of Nox2 in the endothelial cells of the new vessels. In human microvascular endothelial cells, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin reduced NADPH oxidase activity and inhibited the angiogenic responses in vitro. Local treatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or gp91ds-tat peptide significantly suppressed the vessel growth in the chamber.

In this paper, a computational model for tissue differentiation based on the local mechanical environment and the local vascularity is presented. A regular lattice is used to simulate cell activity (migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis). The algorithm for capillary network formation includes mechanoregulation of vessel growth. A simulation of tissue differentiation in a bone/implant gap under shear was performed. The model predicts capillary networks similar to those found in experimental studies and heterogeneous patterns of tissue differentiation, which are influenced by the morphology of the capillary network.

The ability of the chick embryo's chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to efficiently support the growth of inoculated xenogenic tumor cells greatly facilitates analysis of human tumor cell metastasis. During spontaneous metastasis, the highly vascularized CAM sustains rapid tumor formation within several days following cell grafting. The dense capillary network of the CAM also serves as a repository of aggressive tumor cells that escaped from the primary tumor and intravasated into the host vasculature. This spontaneous metastasis setting provides a unique experimental model to study in vivo the intravasation step of the metastatic cascade. During experimental metastasis when tumor cells are inoculated intravenously, the CAM capillary system serves as a place for initial arrest and then, for tumor cell extravasation and colonization. The tissue composition and accessibility of the CAM for experimental interventions makes chick embryo CAM systems attractive models to follow the fate and visualize microscopically the behavior of grafted tumor cells in both spontaneous and experimental metastasis settings.", "journal": "Histochemistry and cell biology", "date": "2008-11-14", "authors": ["Elena IDeryugina", "James PQuigley"], "doi": "10.1007/s00418-008-0536-2\n10.1093/annonc/mdn627"}
{"title": "Patient preferences for treatment for angina: an overview of findings from three studies.", "abstract": "Access to cardiac treatments has been documented to vary with patients' age. It is unknown whether these variations reflect patients' treatment preferences. We aimed to investigate patients' preferences for cardiology treatments and develop a Patients' Preferences Questionnaire.\nSemi-structured interviews with primary care patients with diagnosed angina with postal follow-up. The resulting Patients' Preferences Questionnaire was tested with newly admitted inpatients with acute coronary syndrome and with patients in primary care.\nThe Patients' Preferences Questionnaire was psychometrically sound. Analyses of preference subscale scores showed that the most positive preference scores were for medication. Angioplasty scored highest at the negative end of the scale. Detailed analyses showed that older people and women were less likely to prefer coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), reflecting its greater level of invasiveness. Older people (aged over 75 years, compared to people aged under 75 years), but not women, were also more cautious in their strength of preference for angioplasty. More positive attitudes towards CABG surgery, and more negative attitudes towards medication, were associated with greater impact of the condition on life.\nThe research resulted in a psychometrically sound Patients' Preferences Questionnaire. There was some evidence to support the view that older people's weaker preferences for CABG may contribute slightly to variations in the provision of re-vascularization. There was also variation in preferences within age groups, cautioning against the assumption that all or most older people are more reluctant than younger people to undergo invasive procedures.", "journal": "Journal of health services research & policy", "date": "2008-11-14", "authors": ["AnnBowling", "BarnabyReeves", "GeneRowe"], "doi": "10.1258/jhsrp.2008.008012"}
{"title": "Dual targeting of Raf and VEGF receptor 2 reduces growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer through direct effects on tumor cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes.", "abstract": "The Ras/Raf/MEK pathway represents an important oncogenic signaling pathway in gastrointestinal malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. Although activating B-Raf mutations are infrequent in pancreatic cancer, we hypothesized that targeting Raf could be valuable for therapy of this cancer entity. Moreover, as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is involved in tumor angiogenesis, we sought to investigate the effects of dual inhibition of Raf and VEGFR2 on pancreatic tumor growth, vascularization, and metastasis. Effects of a Raf/VEGFR2 inhibitor (NVP-AAL881) on pancreatic cancer cells, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells were determined by Western blotting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis, and migration assays, respectively. Changes in the expression of VEGF-A or survivin were investigated by ELISA and/or real-time PCR. The growth-inhibitory effects of Raf/VEGFR2 inhibition were additionally evaluated in orthotopic tumor models. Results showed that various Raf isoforms were activated in pancreatic cancer cells and NVP-AAL881 diminished the activation of MEK, Akt, Erk, and also STAT3. Moreover, dual inhibition of Raf/VEGFR2 significantly reduced VEGF expression and impaired cancer cell migration. Importantly, besides blocking VEGF-induced Erk and SAPK phosphorylation in endothelial cells, the Raf inhibitor diminished STAT3 phosphorylation, independent of a VEGFR2 blockade, and reduced the expression of survivin. In addition, cell proliferation and migration of both endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells were significantly reduced. In vivo, blocking Raf/VEGFR2 significantly inhibited orthotopic tumor growth and vascularization and reduced cancer metastasis. In conclusion, blocking Raf exerts growth-inhibitory effects on pancreatic tumor cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes and elicits antiangiogenic properties. Dual targeting of Raf and VEGFR2 appears to be a valid strategy for therapy of pancreatic cancer.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2008-11-13", "authors": ["Sven ALang", "PhilippSchachtschneider", "ChristianMoser", "AkiraMori", "ChristinaHackl", "AndreasGaumann", "DavidBatt", "Hans JSchlitt", "Edward KGeissler", "OliverStoeltzing"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0373"}
{"title": "Tissue engineering using autologous microcirculatory beds as vascularized bioscaffolds.", "abstract": "Classic tissue engineering paradigms are limited by the incorporation of a functional vasculature and a reliable means for reimplantation into the host circulation. We have developed a novel approach to overcome these obstacles using autologous explanted microcirculatory beds (EMBs) as bioscaffolds for engineering complex three-dimensional constructs. In this study, EMBs consisting of an afferent artery, capillary beds, efferent vein, and surrounding parenchymal tissue are explanted and maintained for 24 h ex vivo in a bioreactor that preserves EMB viability and function. Given the rapidly advancing field of stem cell biology, EMBs were subsequently seeded with three distinct stem cell populations, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), and bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We demonstrate MAPCs, as well as MSCs, are able to egress from the microcirculation into the parenchymal space, forming proliferative clusters. Likewise, human adipose tissue-derived MSCs were also found to egress from the vasculature and seed into the EMBs, suggesting feasibility of this technology for clinical applications. We further demonstrate that MSCs can be transfected to express a luciferase protein and continue to remain viable and maintain luciferase expression in vivo. By using the vascular network of EMBs, EMBs can be perfused ex vivo and seeded with stem cells, which can potentially be directed to differentiate into neo-organs or transfected to replace failing organs and deficient proteins.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2008-11-13", "authors": ["Edward IChang", "Robert GBonillas", "SamyraEl-ftesi", "Eric IChang", "Daniel JCeradini", "Ivan NVial", "Denise AChan", "JosephMichaels", "Geoffrey CGurtner"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.08-114868"}

In serum-shocked cells we found circadian expressions for the clock genes Per2 and Dec1 as well as for Dbp, a canonical clock-controlled gene. We obtained similar results for Vegf, a circadian output involved in the control of placental vasculogenesis and trophoblast functions. Interestingly, circadian oscillations persisted and even enhanced in cells experimentally rendered hypoxic with CoCl(2). These results could be explained since the hypoxic milieu of the first-trimester placenta is considered the optimal condition for normal placentation.

{"title": "Deletion of vascular endothelial growth factor in myeloid cells accelerates tumorigenesis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis and the development of a vascular network are required for tumour progression, and they involve the release of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), from both malignant and stromal cell types. Infiltration by cells of the myeloid lineage is a hallmark of many tumours, and in many cases the macrophages in these infiltrates express VEGF-A. Here we show that the deletion of inflammatory-cell-derived VEGF-A attenuates the formation of a typical high-density vessel network, thus blocking the angiogenic switch in solid tumours in mice. Vasculature in tumours lacking myeloid-cell-derived VEGF-A was less tortuous, with increased pericyte coverage and decreased vessel length, indicating vascular normalization. In addition, loss of myeloid-derived VEGF-A decreases the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in tumours, even though overall VEGF-A levels in the tumours are unaffected. However, deletion of myeloid-cell VEGF-A resulted in an accelerated tumour progression in multiple subcutaneous isograft models and an autochthonous transgenic model of mammary tumorigenesis, with less overall tumour cell death and decreased tumour hypoxia. Furthermore, loss of myeloid-cell VEGF-A increased the susceptibility of tumours to chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity. This shows that myeloid-derived VEGF-A is essential for the tumorigenic alteration of vasculature and signalling to VEGFR2, and that these changes act to retard, not promote, tumour progression.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2008-11-11", "authors": ["ChristianStockmann", "AndrewDoedens", "AlexanderWeidemann", "NaZhang", "NorihikoTakeda", "Joshua IGreenberg", "David ACheresh", "Randall SJohnson"], "doi": "10.1038/nature07445"}

Efficacy of these elements was tested in multiple tumor cell lines, both in cell culture and as tumor explants in athymic nude mice. Plasmid and viral vectors were constructed with the AChP promoter alone or in fusion with three copies of the ACE66 enhancer for expression of the prototype suicide gene, thymidine kinase (TK). ACE/AChP and AChP cassettes elicited ganciclovir (GCV)-induced cytotoxicity in multiple tumor cell lines. The ACE enhancer element also exhibited synergism with placental and liver-specific promoter elements. An adenovirus containing the AChP-TK cassette produced striking increases in GCV sensitivity in cultured tumor cell lines, as well as GCV-induced regression of U87 MG glioblastoma explants in vivo. TK expression was distributed throughout tumors receiving the therapeutic virus, whereas TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis revealed numerous regions undergoing apoptosis. Vascularization and reticulin fiber networks were less pronounced in virus-GCV-treated tumors, suggesting that both primary and stromal cell types may have been targeted.

{"title": "Pathological review of late cerebral radionecrosis.", "abstract": "Late cerebral radionecrosis may be considered to be a specific chronic inflammatory response, although it is unknown whether the initial damage by brain irradiation is to an endothelial cell or a glial cell. I discuss the pathological specificity of late cerebral radionecrosis by studying the published literature and a case that I experienced. In late cerebral radionecrosis, there are typical coagulation necrosis areas containing fibrinoid necrosis with occlusion of the lumina and poorly active inflammatory areas with many inflammatory ghost cells, focal perivascular lymphocytes, hyalinized vessels, and telangiectatic vascularization near and in the necrotic tissue, and more active inflammatory areas formed as a partial rim of the reactive zone by perivascular lymphocytes, much vascularization, and GFAP-positive astrocytes at the corticomedullary border adjacent to necrotic tissue in the white matter. It is difficult to believe that coagulation necrosis occurs without first disordering the vascular endothelial cells because fibrinoid necrosis is a main feature and a diffusely multiple lesion in late cerebral radionecrosis. Because various histological findings do develop, progress, and extend sporadically at different areas and times in the irradiated field of the brain for a long time after radiation, uncontrolled chronic inflammation containing various cytokine secretions may also play a key role in progression of this radionecrosis.

This review aims at introducing the concept of adult vasculogenesis and discusses the efforts to identify and characterize adult endothelial progenitors.

D. Anderson Cancer Center, whose diagnosis fulfilled the criteria of IMC or DCIS with mucin production. The patients, all female, had a mean age of 62 years. DCIS was present in 93% of cases and the predominant histological types were solid, cribriform and micropapillary.

Alternatively, it is possible that both cells and their secretory product invade together.

Per2, a circadian gene, is known to regulate endothelium-dependent vasomotion. However, the mechanism by which Per2 affects endothelial function is unknown. We hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction in Per2 mutant (Per2(m/m)) mice is mediated in part by increased vascular senescence and impaired endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function.\nEndothelial cells from Per2(m/m) mice exhibit increased protein kinase Akt signaling, greater senescence, and impaired vascular network formation and proliferation. Indeed, Per2(m/m) mice have impaired blood flow recovery and developed autoamputation of the distal limb when subjected to hind-limb ischemia. Furthermore, matrigel implantation into Per2(m/m) mice resulted in less neovascularization. Because EPCs contribute to angiogenesis, we studied the role of Per2 in these cells using bone marrow transplantation. Basal EPC levels were similar between wild-type and Per2(m/m) mice. However, compared with wild-type bone marrow transplantation mice, EPC mobilization was impaired in Per2(m/m) bone marrow transplantation mice in response to ischemia or VEGF stimulation. Bone marrow transplantation or infusion of wild-type EPC restored blood flow recovery and prevented autoamputation in Per2(m/m) mice.\nThese findings indicate that mutation of Per2 causes Akt-dependent senescence and impairs ischemia-induced revascularization through the alteration of EPC function.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2008-11-05", "authors": ["Chao-YungWang", "Ming-ShienWen", "Hong-WeiWang", "I-ChangHsieh", "YuxinLi", "Ping-YenLiu", "Fun-ChungLin", "James KLiao"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.790469"}

Co-culture of OEC with human primary osteoblasts (pOB) on SPCL, induced an angiogenic activation of OEC towards microvessel-like structures achieved without additional supplementation with angiogenic growth factors. Effects of co-cultures with pOB on the vascularization process by OEC in vivo were tested by subcutaneous implantation of Matrigel plugs containing both, OEC and pOB, and resulted in OEC-derived blood vessels integrated into the host tissue and anastomosed to the vascular supply.

The contribution of OEC to vascular structures and the beneficial effect of the co-culture with primary human osteoblasts on the vascularization in vivo was additionally proven by subcutaneous implantation of pre-cellularized and pre-cultured SPCL constructs. OEC contributed to the vascular structures, by generating autogenic vessels or by incorporation into chimeric vessels consisting of both, human and mouse endothelial cells.

The functional and gene expression changes associated with cellular senescence are poorly understood. Here, we have analyzed the expression, during EC senescence, of 2 different isoforms (L, long; S, short) of endoglin, an auxiliary transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor involved in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. As evidenced by RT-PCR, the S/L ratio of endoglin isoforms was increased during senescence of human ECs in vitro, as well as during aging of mice in vascularized tissues. Next, the effect of S-endoglin protein on the TGF-beta receptor complex was studied. As revealed by coimmunoprecipitation assays, S-endoglin was able to interact with both TGF-beta type I receptors, ALK5 and ALK1, although the interaction with ALK5 was stronger than with ALK1. S-endoglin conferred a lower proliferation rate to ECs and behaved differently from L-endoglin in relation to TGF-beta-responsive reporters with ALK1 or ALK5 specificities, mimicking the behavior of the endothelial senescence markers Id1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated the expression of S-endoglin in the endothelium from human arteries. Transgenic mice overexpressing S-endoglin in ECs showed hypertension, decreased hypertensive response to NO inhibition, decreased vasodilatory response to TGF-beta(1) administration, and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in lungs and kidneys, supporting the involvement of S-endoglin in the NO-dependent vascular homeostasis.

The receptor is also involved in HIV infection and tumor growth and metastasis. Antagonists of CXCR4 have been widely evaluated for drugs against HIV and tumors. In an effort to identify novel CXCR4 antagonists, we screened a small library of compounds derived from marine organisms and found bryostatin-5, which potently inhibits chemotaxis induced by SDF-1 in Jurkat cells. Bryostatin-5 is a member of the macrolactones, and its analogue bryostatin-1 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for its chemotherapeutic potential. The involvement of bryostatins in the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling process has never been reported. In this study, we found that bryostatin-5 potently inhibits SDF-1-induced chemotaxis but does not affect serum-induced chemotaxis. Further studies indicate that this inhibitory effect is not due to receptor antagonism but rather to bryostatin-5-induced receptor desensitization and down-regulation of cell surface CXCR4.

Likewise, it is crucial for tissue-engineered bone to establish a vascular network that temporally precedes new bone formation, and spatially originates from within the graft. In order to recapitulate physiological skeletal development, we have developed a complex bone graft to repair rat bone defects. We have demonstrated that endothelial cells and osteoblasts (identified by cell morphology, quantification of specific marker antigens, calcium deposition and capillary-like growth) were able to differentiate and expand from donor rat bone marrow mononuclear cell populations. The biocompatibilities of poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL)-hydroxyapatite (HA) composites used for graft fabrication were evaluated at different component ratios to identify the optimal and support of cellular viability and functions for endothelial cells and osteoblasts. Using point-injection and low-pressure techniques, seeded endothelial cells and osteoblasts were able to assemble into microvascular networks and form bony matrix in grafts. The exogenous origination of these cells and their contribution to the vascularization and osteogenesis was confirmed using sex-mismatch implantation and Y chromosome tracking. By pre-seeding with endothelial cells, the resulting vascularization was able to promote osteogenesis, prevent ischemic necrosis and improve the mechanical properties in engineered bone tissue. Taken together, the results indicated that the integration of complex cell populations with composite scaffold materials provided an effective technique to improve osteogenesis in engineered bone graft.

To readily facilitate the selection of agents targeted to oxygen-deficient cells in solid tumors, we have developed a simple and convenient two-enzyme system to generate oxygen deficiency in cell cultures. Glucose oxidase is employed to deplete oxygen from the medium by selectively oxidizing glucose and reducing molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide; an excess of catalase is also used to scavenge the peroxide molecules. Rapid and sustained depletion of oxygen occurs in medium or buffer, even in the presence of oxygen at the liquid/air interface. Studies using CHO/AA8 Chinese hamster cells, EMT6 murine mammary carcinoma cells, and U251 human glioma cells indicate that this system generates an oxygen deficiency that produces activation of the hypoxia-targeted prodrug KS119.

For the evaluation of von Willebrand factor (vWF) secretion and tissue factor (TF) expression, we used human endothelial cells.

As the underlying factors that lead to AHF development are not well understood, it was of interest to investigate the vascularization of AHFs compared with normal follicles and corpora lutea (controls). In the present study, the ovarian cell populations investigated immunohistochemically included granulosa and luteal cells as well as various vascular structures. None of these cell types showed differences in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) between control ovaries containing normal follicles and corpora lutea and ovaries with AHFs. In contrast, a considerable reduction in the proportion of Flk-1-expressing cells, together with a decreased intensity of staining, was apparent in the AHFs. This greatly reduced expression of Flk-1 in the luteinized cells and the vascular structures of AHFs may lead to a distinct decrease in the potential pro-angiogenic activity of VEGF-A in these structures compared with the situation in normal follicles and corpora lutea. Furthermore, the authors suspect that the distinct expression of angiopoietin2 and VEGF-A seen in the cells within the inner fibrous layers of the AHFs was caused by hypoxia resulting from deficient vascularization, as suggested by the irregularity of the capillaries present in the luteinized wall of the AHF. In addition, whereas LH-receptor (LH-R) expression occurred uniformly in all stages of development of the corpora lutea in normal control ovaries, there was highly variable labelling for LH-R in all the AHFs examined, thereby indicating a possible numerical deficiency of LH-receptors in AHFs.

{"title": "Emerging pulmonary vasculature lacks fate specification.", "abstract": "Lung morphogenesis requires precise coordination between branching morphogenesis and vascularization to generate distal airways capable of supporting respiration at the cell-cell interface. The specific origins and types of blood vessels that initially form in the lung, however, remain obscure. Herein, we definitively show that during the early phases of lung development [i.e., embryonic day (E) 11.5], functional vessels, replete with blood flow, are restricted to the mesenchyme, distal to the epithelium. However, by day E14.5, and in response to epithelial-derived VEGF signals, functional vessels extend from the mesenchyme to the epithelial interface. Moreover, these vessels reside adjacent to multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells that likely play a regulatory role in this process. As well as and distinct from the systemic vasculature, immunostaining for EphrinB2 and EphB4 revealed that arterial and venous identity is not distinguishable in emergent pulmonary vasculature. Collectively, this study provides evidence that lung vascularization initially originates in the mesenchyme, distal to the epithelium, and that arterial-venous specification does not exist in the early lung. At a mechanistic level, we show that basilar epithelial VEGF prompts endothelial cells to move toward the epithelium where they undergo morphogenesis during the proliferative, canalicular stage. Thus our findings challenge existing notions of vascular origin and identity during development.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Recently, several integrated bioengineering strategies have been applied to improve bioengineered adipose tissue grafts, including internalized microchannels, delivery of angiogenic growth factors, tailored biomaterials and transplantation of precursor cells with continuing differentiation potential.

{"title": "Fate of the nasal capsular cartilages in prenatal and perinatal tamarins (Saguinus geoffroyi) and extent of secondary pneumatization of maxillary and frontal sinuses.", "abstract": "Development of the nasal capsule cartilages was studied in seven Geoffroy's tamarins (Saguinus geoffroyi), including one fetus, five neonates and one infant. Four additional postnatal specimens of the genus were studied (one 5-month-old and three adults) to determine the magnitude of postnatal expansion of the paranasal sinuses. Alcian blue histochemistry and osteopontin immunohistochemistry were employed in selected subadult specimens to characterize cartilage matrix. The fetal S. geoffroyi possesses a continuous nasal capsule, including a zona anularis; the primordial maxillary sinuses are surrounded by cartilage. Secondary pneumatization is in progress in all older specimens, which have sinuses that are more than twofold larger compared to that of the fetus. Results indicate that extensive ossification of the middle part of the nasal capsule (pars intermedia) is occurring in the perinatal timeframe, forming portions of the ethmoid bone. Anteriorly, the nasal capsule comprises isolated fragments in perinatal specimens, which are fewer and smaller in the infant and in a 5-month-old S. midas, and nearby multinucleate cells suggest that osteoclasts break apart these initially continuous elements. Fragments of the pars intermedia and the tectum nasi are found transiently between mucosa and the sites of secondary pneumatization. The maxillary sinus mucosa is highly vascular in most perinatal specimens. Histochemical and immunohistochemical findings show that cartilage of endochondral bones and non-ossifying parts are distinct in the perinatal time period. These results indicate that breakdown of the capsular cartilage precedes secondary pneumatization as previously suggested. There are portions of the cartilage of the recessus maxillaris and tectum nasi that transiently block mucosa from interfacing directly with bone. Vascularization may play a role in the breakdown of cartilages as well as the onset of secondary pneumatization. Since cartilage has the capacity to produce substances that trigger angiogenesis and bone resorption, further detailed characterization of the cartilage bordering sites of secondary pneumatization is merited.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2008-10-28", "authors": ["Timothy DSmith", "James BRossie", "Beth ADocherty", "Gregory MCooper", "Christopher JBonar", "Anthony LSilverio", "Anne MBurrows"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.20787"}

Using radioiodine labeling, the effect of heparin on the binding of ANG to the scaffold was studied. The release of ANG from the heparinized scaffold was investigated using a radioiodine labeling method or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. In vivo angiogenesis of the scaffold was studied for 28 days. All scaffolds possess three-dimensional porous structures, and their mean pore sizes increase upon EDC-NHS cross-linking. The binding of ANG to the scaffold showed a linear correlation with ANG concentration. With ANG concentrations of 160 ng/mL, the binding of ANG to the heparinized scaffold was 36.5%. In vitro, ANG was released from the heparinized scaffold in a controlled manner.

{"title": "Angiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues.", "abstract": "Vascular development and homeostasis are underpinned by two fundamental features: the generation of new vessels to meet the metabolic demands of under-perfused regions and the elimination of vessels that do not sustain flow. In this paper we develop the first multiscale model of vascular tissue growth that combines blood flow, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling and the subcellular and tissue scale dynamics of multiple cell populations. Simulations show that vessel pruning, due to low wall shear stress, is highly sensitive to the pressure drop across a vascular network, the degree of pruning increasing as the pressure drop increases. In the model, low tissue oxygen levels alter the internal dynamics of normal cells, causing them to release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates angiogenic sprouting. Consequently, the level of blood oxygenation regulates the extent of angiogenesis, with higher oxygenation leading to fewer vessels. Simulations show that network remodelling (and de novo network formation) is best achieved via an appropriate balance between pruning and angiogenesis. An important factor is the strength of endothelial tip cell chemotaxis in response to VEGF. When a cluster of tumour cells is introduced into normal tissue, as the tumour grows hypoxic regions form, producing high levels of VEGF that stimulate angiogenesis and cause the vascular density to exceed that for normal tissue. If the original vessel network is sufficiently sparse then the tumour may remain localised near its parent vessel until new vessels bridge the gap to an adjacent vessel. This can lead to metastable periods, during which the tumour burden is approximately constant, followed by periods of rapid growth.", "journal": "Journal of mathematical biology", "date": "2008-10-23", "authors": ["Markus ROwen", "Tom\u00e1sAlarc\u00f3n", "Philip KMaini", "Helen MByrne"], "doi": "10.1007/s00285-008-0213-z"}

{"title": "The inflammatory response to skeletal muscle injury: illuminating complexities.", "abstract": "Injury of skeletal muscle, and especially mechanically induced damage such as contusion injury, frequently occurs in contact sports, as well as in accidental contact sports, such as hockey and squash. The large variations with regard to injury severity and affected muscle group, as well as non-specificity of reported symptoms, complicate research aimed at finding suitable treatments. Therefore, in order to increase the chances of finding a successful treatment, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms inherent to this type of skeletal muscle injury and the cellular processes involved in muscle healing following a contusion injury. Arguably the most important of these processes is inflammation since it is a consistent and lasting response. The inflammatory response is dependent on two factors, namely the extent of actual physical damage and the degree of muscle vascularization at the time of injury. However, long-term anti-inflammatory treatment is not necessarily effective in promoting healing, as indicated by various studies on NSAID treatment. Because of the factors named earlier, human studies on the inflammatory response to contusion injury are limited, but several experimental animal models have been designed to study muscle damage and regeneration. The early recovery phase is characterized by the overlapping processes of inflammation and occurrence of secondary damage. Although neutrophil infiltration has been named as a contributor to the latter, no clear evidence exists to support this claim. Macrophages, although forming part of the inflammatory response, have been shown to have a role in recovery, rather than in exacerbating secondary damage. Several probable roles for this cell type in the second phase of recovery, involving resolution processes, have been identified and include the following: (i) phagocytosis to remove cellular debris; (ii) switching from a pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotype in regenerating muscle; (iii) preventing muscle cells from undergoing apoptosis; (iv) releasing factors to promote muscle precursor cell activation and growth; and (v) secretion of cytokines and growth factors to facilitate vascular and muscle fibre repair. These many different roles suggest that a single treatment with one specific target cell population (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages or satellite cells) may not be equally effective in all phases of the post-injury response. To find the optimal targeted, but time-course-dependent, treatments requires substantial further investigations. However, the techniques currently used to induce mechanical injury vary considerably in terms of invasiveness, tools used to induce injury, muscle group selected for injury and contractile status of the muscle, all of which have an influence on the immune and/or cytokine responses. This makes interpretation of the complex responses more difficult. After our review of the literature, we propose that a standardized non-invasive contusion injury is the ideal model for investigations into the immune responses to mechanical skeletal muscle injury. Despite its suitability as a model, the currently available literature with respect to the inflammatory response to injury using contusion models is largely inadequate. Therefore, it may be premature to investigate highly targeted therapies, which may ultimately prove more effective in decreasing athlete recovery time than current therapies that are either not phase-specific, or not administered in a phase-specific fashion.", "journal": "Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)", "date": "2008-10-22", "authors": ["CarineSmith", "Maritza JKruger", "Robert MSmith", "Kathryn HMyburgh"], "doi": "10.2165/00007256-200838110-00005"}

We modulated cortactin expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. Cortactin expression levels directly correlated with tumor size, vascularization and cell proliferation in an orthotopic HNSCC in vivo model. In contrast, under normal in vitro culture conditions, cortactin expression levels had no effect on cell proliferation. However, cell lines in which cortactin expression was reduced by knockdown (KD) grew poorly in vitro under harsh conditions of growth factor deprivation, anchorage independence and space constraint. In contrast, overexpression of cortactin enhanced in vitro growth under the same harsh conditions. Surprisingly, defects in growth factor-independent proliferation of cortactin-KD cells were rescued by coculture with cortactin-expressing cells. As the cocultured cells are separated by permeable filters, cortactin-expressing cells must secrete growth-supporting autocrine factors to rescue the cortactin-KD cells.

{"title": "Monocytes and dendritic cells in a hypoxic environment: Spotlights on chemotaxis and migration.", "abstract": "A common denominator of several pathological conditions, such as solid tumors and inflammatory lesions, is represented by low partial oxygen pressure (pO(2))(2). Mononuclear phagocytes are recruited in large numbers as primary monocytes from the circulation to diseased tissues, where they accumulate within ischemic/hypoxic sites terminally differentiating into inflammatory and tumor-associated macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). Thus, mononuclear phagocyte responses that ensue at pathological sites begin in the setting of reduced pO(2). In the last years, extensive work from several groups has been carried out to characterize hypoxia-mediated changes in mononuclear phagocyte gene expression and functional properties under different pathologic situations, demonstrating that oxygen availability is a critical regulator of their functional behavior. However, the majority of reports are focused on the characterization of differentiated macrophages, in particular tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TAM), whereas limited evidence is available for what concerns the responses of peripheral blood monocytes or DCs to the local hypoxic environment. This brief review provides an overview of the phenotypic and functional changes triggered by hypoxia in primary monocytes and DCs. A major focus is given to the chemotactic activity and migratory behavior of these cells when exposed to levels of hypoxia similar to those present in ischemic tissues. Specifically, we discuss the influence of the local hypoxic microenvironment on the expression profile of genes involved in cell motility/migration. Experimental evidence demonstrating that hypoxia modulates in primary monocytes the expression of a selected cluster of chemokine genes with a characteristic dichotomy resulting in the up-regulation of those active on neutrophils and the inhibition of those predominantly active on monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, NK cells, basophils and/or DCs is reported. We also review the findings suggestive of a negative regulatory role of hypoxia on monocyte migration, which is exerted through several alternative or complementary mechanisms and results in monocyte \"trapping\" within ischemic/hypoxic sites of diseased tissues. Furthermore, we summarize data relative to the ability of hypoxia to differentially regulate in immature DCs (iDCs) the expression profile of genes coding for chemokines and chemokine receptors, the former being down-regulated and the latter up-regulated, thus promoting the switch from a proinflammatory to a migratory phenotype of iDCs by, respectively, reducing their capacity to recruit other inflammatory leukocytes and increasing their sensitivity to chemoattractants. Similarities and differences between the gene expression pattern induced by hypoxia in primary monocytes and that reported in differentiated macrophages are also outlined in this review, to attempt to establish which gene clusters representative of the hypoxic transcriptome of mononuclear phagocytes are specific for a certain stage of differentiation. In particular, we discuss the partial overlap existing among mononuclear phagocytes at various differentiation stages in the expression of a cluster of hypoxia-responsive genes coding for regulators of angiogenesis, proinflammatory cytokines/receptors, and inflammatory mediators and implicated in tissue neo-vascularization and cell activation. Finally, we review studies on the transcription pathways underlying hypoxia-regulated gene expression in monocytic lineage cells, which support a major role for the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)/hypoxia responsive element (HRE) pathway in monocyte extravasation and migration to hypoxic sites and in the activation of monocyte/macrophage proinflammatory and immunoregulatory responses by hypoxia both in vitro and in vivo. Recent experimental evidence suggesting the requirement of additional transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), Ets-1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha/beta (C/EBPalpha/beta), activator-protein-1 (AP-1), and early growth response-1 (Egr-1), for hypoxic regulation of gene transcription in primary human monocytes and differentiated macrophages and indicative of the existence of both a positive and a negative O(2)-driven HIF-1-dependent feedback regulatory mechanism of hypoxia transcriptional response in primary monocytes, are also reported.", "journal": "Immunobiology", "date": "2008-10-18", "authors": ["Maria CarlaBosco", "MauraPuppo", "FabiolaBlengio", "TizianaFraone", "PaolaCappello", "MirellaGiovarelli", "LuigiVaresio"], "doi": "10.1016/j.imbio.2008.07.031"}

When reoperation is required because of infection or tumor recurrence, management of the intracranial dead space can be challenging. By providing well-vascularized bulky tissue, intracranial microvascular free flaps offer potential solutions to these life-threatening complications. A multi-institutional retrospective chart and radiographic review was performed of all patients who underwent microvascular free-flap surgery for salvage treatment of postoperative intracranial infections between 1998 and 2006. A total of six patients were identified with large intracranial defects and postoperative intracranial infections.

Follow-up was performed in 1996 and in 2003 with six patients who underwent wrist reconstruction in the 1980s.

Evaluation was performed with functional and radiographic examinations. Three cases that were examined in 2003 are presented in detail. The study shows that if growth plates are closed at the time of procedure or the transplanted fibula is long enough to ensure anastomotic flow between metaphyseal and epiphyseal vessels, results are good. If any of these two conditions is not fulfilled, vascular supply to the epiphysis is insufficient. Long bone deviation or bone necrosis will result.

{"title": "HB-EGF stimulates eNOS expression and nitric oxide production and promotes eNOS dependent angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of ligands that is expressed by many cell types including endothelial cells. We have previously shown that HB-EGF stimulates angiogenesis in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Nitric oxide (NO) derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important regulator of angiogenesis. However, the role of HB-EGF in regulation of eNOS has not yet been investigated. Whether HB-EGF-induced endothelial cell migration and vascular network formation are mediated via production of NO from eNOS is also unknown. To address these questions, we stimulated HUVEC with HB-EGF and evaluated the expression of eNOS at the mRNA and protein levels. HB-EGF significantly upregulated expression of eNOS mRNA, stimulated eNOS protein production, and increased NO release from HUVEC. HB-EGF phosphorylated eNOS in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent fashion, and stimulated in vitro angiogenesis. eNOS siRNA inhibited HB-EGF-stimulated HUVEC migration in a scratch assay. NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) and L-N5-(1-lminoethyl)ornithine,dihydochloride (L-NIO) (specific inhibitors of eNOS) also abolished HB-EGF-induced HUVEC migration and angiogenesis. More importantly, we found that HB-EGF also promotes angiogenesis in vivo in the Marigel plug assay. Lastly, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway enhanced HB-EGF-induced EC migration and angiogenesis. We conclude that HB-EGF, through its interaction with EGF receptors (EGFR), stimulates eNOS activation and NO production via a PI3K-dependent pathway. Thus, activation of eNOS appears to be one of the key signaling pathways necessary for HB-EGF mediated angiogenesis. These novel findings highlight an important role for HB-EGF as a regulator of endothelial cell function.", "journal": "Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)", "date": "2008-10-18", "authors": ["Veela BMehta", "YuZhou", "AndreiRadulescu", "Gail EBesner"], "doi": "10.1080/08977190802393596"}

A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying angiogenesis in HCC will improve the rational choice of anti-angiogenic treatment. We quantified gene and protein expression of members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin systems and studied localization of VEGF, its receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, Angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and Ang-2, and their receptor, in HCC in noncirrhotic and cirrhotic livers. We employed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistology, and compared the outcome with highly angiogenic human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). HCC in noncirrhotic and cirrhotic livers expressed VEGF and its receptors to a similar extent as normal liver, although in cirrhotic background, VEGFR-2 levels in both tumor and adjacent tissue were decreased. Ang-1 expression was slightly increased compared with normal liver, whereas Tie-2 was strongly down-regulated in the tumor vasculature. Ang-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were also low in HCCs of both noncirrhotic and cirrhotic livers, implying that VEGF-driven angiogenic sprouting accompanied by angiopoietin-driven vascular destabilization is not pronounced. In RCC, VEGF-A levels were one order of magnitude higher. At the same time, endothelially expressed Ang-2 was over 30-fold increased compared with expression in normal kidney, whereas Ang-1 expression was decreased.\nIn hepatocellular carcinoma, tumor vascularization is not per se VEGF/angiopoietin driven. However, increased CD31 expression and morphological changes representative of sinusoidal capillarization in tumor vasculature indicate that vascular remodeling is taking place.

The pedicled vascularized scapula was successfully transferred into the humeral head using the angular branch. The patient's right shoulder pain disappeared following surgical recovery.

{"title": "Transforming growth factor-beta1 and CD105 promote the migration of hepatocellular carcinoma-derived endothelium.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of most malignant and aggressive human tumors. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and its coreceptor CD105 have been shown to contribute to HCC malignant progression. TGF-beta1 and CD105 have also been implicated in angiogenesis, but their role in the vascularization of HCC has not been investigated. To fill this gap, we studied the effect of TGF-beta1 and CD105 on HCC-derived endothelium. By using immunomagnetic beads, we isolated and cultured endothelial cells (ECs) from HCC (HCC-EC) and adjacent nonneoplastic tissue (nNL-ECs) obtained from 24 liver biopsies. HCC and nNL biopsies were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of CD105, TGF-beta1, Ve-cadherin (Ve-cad), CD44, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin. Compared with nNL-ECs, HCC-ECs had higher expression of CD105, enhanced spontaneous motility, and greater capacity to migrate in response to TGF-beta1 (5 ng/mL), particularly in the presence of a fibronectin matrix. The chemotactic effect of TGF-beta1 was blocked by anti-CD105 antibodies and correlated with the grade of HCC malignancy. Histologic examination of HCC biopsies showed that HCCs with the worse malignant features had the highest expression of TGF-beta1, CD105, and angiogenic markers (Ve-cad and CD44). Because CD105 was highly expressed in microvessels at the tumor periphery and TGF-beta1 staining was only found in neoplastic hepatocytes, we conclude that HCC-derived TGF-beta1 may act as a chemoattractant for CD105-expressing ECs and as a promoter of tumor angiogenesis. Thus, drugs that selectively target the TGF-beta1/CD105 axis may interfere with HCC-related angiogenesis and HCC progression.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2008-10-17", "authors": ["AnnaBenetti", "AngiolaBerenzi", "MarcoGambarotti", "EmirenaGarrafa", "MaurizioGelati", "EnricoDessy", "NazarioPortolani", "TullioPiardi", "Stefano MariaGiulini", "ArnaldoCaruso", "GloriaInvernici", "Eugenio AgostinoParati", "RobertoNicosia", "GiulioAlessandri"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1218"}

This network is composed of endothelial cells enclosed by vascular smooth muscle, pericytes, and other mesenchymal cells. Recent in vivo lineage labeling studies in the developing heart and intestine suggest that some of the vascular smooth muscle cells arise from the surface mesothelium. In the developing lung, the Wilm's tumor 1 gene (Wt1) is expressed only in the mesothelial cells. Therefore, we lineage-labeled the mesothelium in vivo by using a Wt1-Cre transgene in combination with either Rosa26R(lacZ), Rosa26R(CAG-hPLAP), or Rosa26R(EYFP) reporter alleles. In all three cases, cells derived from lineage-labeled mesothelium are found inside the lung and as smooth muscle actin (SMA) and PDGF receptor-beta positive cells in the walls of pulmonary blood vessels. To corroborate this finding, we used 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester \"mixed isomers\" (CCFSE) dye to label mesothelial cells on the surface of the embryonic lung. Over the course of 72-h culture, dye-labeled cells also appear within the lung mesenchyme.

Changes in expression or activity of transcription factors result in diverse and manifold effects on the whole transcriptome of the cell. Therefore transcription factors are of special interest in physiological as well as pathological processes particularly tumour development and progression. In this review we focus on Ets-1, the prototype of the ETS family of transcription factors. ETS family members play important roles in development, differentiation and proliferation of cells in general and they are involved in apoptosis and tissue remodelling as well. Most of them are downstream nuclear targets of Ras-MAP kinase signalling and the deregulation of ets genes results in malignant transformation of different cells. Several ets genes are rearranged in human leukaemia, Ewing tumours and prostate cancer to produce chimeric oncoproteins. Furthermore, an aberrant expression of several ets genes is often observed in various types of human malignant tumours. With regard to the involvement of some ETS transcription factors, especially Ets-1, in malignant transformation and tumour progression (including invasion, metastasis and neoangiogenesis) through transactivation of cancer related genes, they are potential molecular targets for selective cancer therapy.

{"title": "Tumour hypoxia affects the responsiveness of cancer cells to chemotherapy and promotes cancer progression.", "abstract": "A solid tumour forms an organ-like structure that is comprised of cancer cells as well as stroma cells (fibroblasts, inflammatory cells) that are embedded in an extracellular matrix and are nourished by vascular network. However, tumoral microenvironment is heterogeneous due to the abnormal vasculature network and high proliferation rate of cancer cells. Because of these features, some regions are starved from oxygen, a phenomenon called hypoxia. Transient hypoxia is associated with inadequate blood flow while chronic hypoxia is the consequence of the increased oxygen diffusion distance due to tumour expansion. Both types of hypoxia are correlated with poor outcome for patients. Moreover, hypoxia also enhances chemoresistance of cancer cells. Firstly, the delivery of drugs in hypoxic area and cellular uptake of it are affected by hypoxia or associated acidity. Secondly, some chemotherapeutic drugs require oxygen to generate free radicals that contribute to cytotoxicity. Last, hypoxia induces cellular adaptations that compromise the effectiveness of chemotherapy. In response to nutrient deprivation due to hypoxia, the rate of proliferation of cancer cells decreases but chemotherapeutic drugs are more effective against proliferating cells. On the other hand, hypoxia induces adaptation by post-translational and transcriptional changes that promote cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Through these changes, hypoxia promotes angiogenesis, shift to glycolytic metabolism, expression of ABC transporters, cell survival by inducing the expression of genes encoding growth factors and the modulation of apoptotic process. The aim of this review is to provide a description of known hypoxia-induced mechanisms of chemoresistance at a cellular level.", "journal": "Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry", "date": "2008-10-16", "authors": ["Jean-PhilippeCosse", "CarineMichiels"], "doi": "10.2174/187152008785914798"}

{"title": "The relationship of photoreceptor degeneration to retinal vascular development and loss in mutant rhodopsin transgenic and RCS rats.", "abstract": "The early loss of photoreceptors in some retinal degenerations in mice has been shown to have a profound effect on vascular development of the retina. To better characterize this relationship, we have examined the formation of retinal blood vessels during the first month of life in 8 lines of transgenic rats with different ages of onset and rates of photoreceptor cell loss mediated by the expression of mutant rhodopsin (P23H and S334ter). The number of capillary profiles in the superficial plexus (SP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) of the retina were quantified in retinal sections taken at postnatal day (P) 8, 10, 12, 15 and 30. In normal wild-type rats, the SP and DCP had mostly established mature, adult patterns by P15, as previously shown. In the transgenic rats, the loss of photoreceptors had relatively little effect on the SP. By contrast, the loss of photoreceptors during vascular development had a major impact on the DCP. In the two lines with early and most rapid photoreceptor loss, S334ter-7 and S334ter-3, where about 90% and 65%, respectively, of the photoreceptors were already lost by P15, the DCP either failed to form (S334ter-7) or the number of capillary profiles was less than 7% of controls (S334ter-3). In lines where almost all photoreceptors were still present at P15 (S334ter-4, S334ter-9, P23H-2 and P23H-3), the number of profiles in the DCP were the same as in wild-type controls at P30. In two lines with an intermediate rate of degeneration (S334ter-5 and P23H-1), where only about 25% of the photoreceptors were lost by P15, there was an intermediate number of vascular profiles in the DCP at P30. Thus, a very close relationship between the number of photoreceptors and vessel profiles in the DCP during its development exists in the transgenic rats, and the loss of photoreceptors results in the failure or inhibition of the DCP to develop. Several mechanisms may explain this relationship including changes in the level of physiological oxygen tension or alteration in the release of angiogenic factors that normally drive vessel development. Analysis of older transgenic retinas up to 1 year of age revealed that (1) vascular profiles are lost from the DCP in essentially all lines once fewer than about 30-33% of photoreceptors remain; (2) in those lines where the DCP essentially did not develop (S334ter-7 and S334ter-3), the effect of photoreceptor absence was permanent, and there was no late vascularization of the DCP; (3) the number of capillary profiles in the SP remained no different from controls in any of the lines, despite long-standing loss of photoreceptors; and (4) neovascularization of the RPE by retinal capillaries occurred with a latency of 60-180 days after the loss of photoreceptors, except in S334ter-7 rats, where neovascularization essentially did not occur.

Different AR methods also were evaluated. Maximal retrieval of CD31 was achieved using 0.5 M Tris (pH 10) buffer, while maximum retrieval of F VIII RAg was achieved using 0.05% pepsin treatment of tissue sections. For each optimized retrieval condition, anti-CD31 highlighted small vessels better than F VIII RAg. Furthermore, the MVD of CD31 was significantly greater than that of F VIII RAg decorated vessels (p<0.001).

{"title": "Altered placental function of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 knockout mice.", "abstract": "Fetal glucocorticoid exposure is a key mechanism proposed to underlie prenatal \"programming\" of adult cardiometabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Regulation of fetal glucocorticoid exposure is achieved by the placental glucocorticoid \"barrier,\" which involves glucocorticoid inactivation within the labyrinth zone of the murine placenta by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11beta-HSD2). Thus, the absence of placental 11beta-HSD2 may impact on fetal and placental development. The current study investigated transport of amino acids and glucose, key factors required for fetal growth, and vascular development in placentas from 11beta-HSD2(+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) fetuses derived from 11beta-HSD2(+/-) matings. At embryonic d 15 (E15) (term = E19), 11beta-HSD2(-/-) fetal weight was maintained in comparison to 11beta-HSD2(+/+) fetuses. The maintenance of 11beta-HSD2(-/-) fetal weight occurred despite a reduction in placental weight, suggesting that compensatory changes occur in the placenta to maintain function. However, by E18, 11beta-HSD2(-/-) fetal and placental weights were both reduced. Transport studies revealed up-regulation of placental amino acid transport to 11beta-HSD2(-/-) offspring at E15, coinciding with an increase in the expression of the amino acid transporters. Furthermore, at E18, placental glucose transport to 11beta-HSD2(-/-) offspring was markedly reduced, correlating with lower fetal weight and a decrease in glucose transporter 3 expression. Stereological analyses of the labyrinth zone of the placenta revealed that the reduction in placental weight at E18 was associated with restriction of the normal increase in fetal vessel density over the final third of pregnancy. Our data suggest that restriction of fetal growth in 11beta-HSD2(-/-) mice is mediated, at least in part, via altered placental transport of nutrients and reduction in placental vascularization.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2008-10-11", "authors": ["Caitlin SWyrwoll", "Jonathan RSeckl", "Megan CHolmes"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2008-1100"}

There was a significant rhCC10 dose-dependent increase in respiratory compliance and ventilation efficiency index; both parameters were significantly greater in animals treated with 5 mg/kg rhCC10 than those treated with surfactant alone. Similarly, there was a significant rhCC10 dose and protein-dependent increase in surfactant protein (SP-B > SP-C > SP-A) and dose- and isoform-dependent increase in VEGF (VEGF189 > VEGF165 > VEGF121).

This is a retrospective study of patients with spondylodiscitis treated with metal implants.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the outcome in 22 consecutive patients (mean age 69 (43-82) years, 15 men) with spondylodiscitis (20 lumbar and 12 thoracic discs) who had received an anterior titanium cage implantation. In 13 cases, the pathogen could be identified. Antibiotic treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks postoperatively.\nThe mean follow-up was 36 (32-47) months.

Factors produced by endothelial cells of meniscal vessels may contribute to better wound healing in vascularized zones. We therefore investigated the expression of different angiogenic factors, growth hormones and cytokines in human fibrochondrocytes and in fibrochondrocytes upon co-culture with endothelial cells, to examine mechanisms of repair of meniscal injury in more detail and to investigate the potential use of endothelial cells in co-cultures for autologous meniscal repair utilizing tissue engineering technology.\nGene expression of SMAD-4, iNOS, IL-1beta, VEGF, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, aggrecan, biglycan, vimentin, collagen-I, -II, -III, -IV, -VI, -X, -XVIII, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and thrombostatin-1 were investigated in fibrochondrocytes in comparison to cells in co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).

They are nascently formed upon cellular activation by extrinsic (environmental) factors, including mitogens, cell-mediated immune memory reactions (Landsteiner-Chase-Lawrence transfer factors), and metabolic (hypoxia) and (physical) shear stress forces. Those factors are conventional models for epigenetic (non-Mendelian) vascular remodeling variations directed rather to proteinaceous gene expression and regulation than genomic DNA sequence changes. Structurally defined ncNAs are described as small hairpin nc-shRNA bioaptamers in interaction with proteins forming functional (Cu,Ca,Na,K)-metalloregulated complexes (CuRNP; angiotropins). As nonmitogenic angiomorphogen cytokines (ribokines), they may reprogram confluent quiescent (contact-inhibited) endothelial cell types to migratory, phagokinetically active phenotypes in the morphogenesis of tolerated neovascular patterns. Their functions in organized and mess-chaotic vascular patterns were investigated with regard to master gene, information, epigenetic, vascular, and tumor factors. Some ncNAs feature three-dimensional codes (3D episcripts) for distinct protein conformer phases. They are suggested as being specific recognition types, the estimated repertoires of which are superior in diversity and specificity to conventional immune (glyco-)proteins. For episcription of phenotype variations, they may address and integrate information flow on molecular shapes to protein-mediated nucleic acid processing and [post-]translational modification mechanisms in ncNA-, redox, and metalloregulated conformation phase pathway-locked loops (CPLL).

The effects of GPR91 are mediated by retinal ganglion neurons (RGCs), which, in response to increased succinate levels, regulate the production of numerous angiogenic factors including VEGF. Accordingly, succinate did not have proangiogenic effects in RGC-deficient rats.

We have demonstrated that VEGF regulates the expression of CCN2/connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) an essential mediator of cartilage development and angiogenesis, suggesting that CCN2 functions in down-stream of VEGF, and that VEGF function is mediated in part by CCN2. On the other hand, the phenotype of Ccn2 mutant growth plates, which exhibit decreased expression of VEGF in the hypertrophic zone, indicates that Vegf expression is dependent on Ccn2 expression as well. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of VEGF by CCN2 using a human chondrocytic cell line, HCS-2/8. Hypoxic stimulation (5% O(2)) of HCS-2/8 cells increased VEGF mRNA levels by approximately 8 fold within 6 h as compared with the cells cultured under normoxia. In addition, VEGF expression was further up-regulated under hypoxia in HCS-2/8 cells transfected with a Ccn2 expression plasmid. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mRNA and protein levels were increased by stimulation with recombinant CCN2 (rCCN2). Furthermore, the activity of a VEGF promoter that contained a HIF-1 binding site was increased in HCS-2/8, when the cells were stimulated by rCCN2. These results suggest that CCN2 regulates the expression of VEGF at a transcriptional level by promoting HIF-1alpha activity. In fact, HIF-1alpha was detected in the nuclei of proliferative and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes of wild-type mice, whereas it was not detected in Ccn2 mutant chondrocytes in vivo.

{"title": "Inhibition of corneal neovascularization by blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor.", "abstract": "To determine the role of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling in corneal neovascularization.\nCorneal neovascularization was induced by suturing 10-0 nylon 1 mm away from limbal vessels in C57 BJ6 mice. Angiotensinogen and its receptor (AT1R) gene expression levels were evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of angiotensin II (Ang2) and AT1R was confirmed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. To investigate the function of Ang2 in corneal neovascularization, infiltrating macrophages in vascularized corneas and the neovascularized area were investigated after intraperitoneal injection of an AT1R antagonist (telmisartan, 10 mg/kg). Further, corneal mRNA of VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, ICAM-1, and TNF-alpha was examined in control and telmisartan-treated mice.\nAng2 and AT1R markedly increased in the neovascularized corneas compared with normal corneas. Ang2 and AT1R were expressed in epithelium and stromal cells (vascular endothelium, infiltrating leukocytes, and keratocytes) in neovascularized cornea at protein levels and were weakly detected in normal corneal epithelium. Infiltrating macrophages were reduced in telmisartan-treated mice on day 7 after suturing. Neovascularized area in the cornea of telmisartan-treated mice was 70% smaller than that of control mice on day 7 after suturing. A PPAR-gamma antagonist partially, but significantly, reversed the suppressive effect of telmisartan on induction of corneal neovascularization. The expression of VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, and ICAM-1 was significantly inhibited in telmisartan-treated mice.\nThese findings indicate that Ang2, abundantly expressed in neovascularized corneas, has a significant role in inflammation-related driven corneal neovascularization. AT1R may be a therapeutic target for the suppression of corneal neovascularization.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2008-10-03", "authors": ["TomohikoUsui", "KenjiSugisaki", "AyaIriyama", "SeiichiYokoo", "SatoruYamagami", "NorihiroNagai", "SusumuIshida", "ShiroAmano"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.07-0964"}

While the Hox transcriptional regulators have to be viewed as excellent candidates for assuming such a role, little is known about their presumptive cardiovascular control functions and in vivo expression patterns.\nWe demonstrate that conventional reporter gene analysis in transgenic mice is a useful approach for defining highly complex Hox expression patterns in the adult vascular network as exemplified by our lacZ reporter gene models for Hoxa3 and Hoxc11. These mice revealed expression in subsets of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) located in distinct regions of the vasculature that roughly correspond to the embryonic expression domains of the two genes. These reporter gene patterns were validated as authentic indicators of endogenous gene expression by immunolabeling and PCR analysis. Furthermore, we show that persistent reporter gene expression in cultured cells derived from vessel explants facilitates in vitro characterization of phenotypic properties as exemplified by the differential response of Hoxc11-lacZ-positive versus-negative cells in migration assays and to serum.\nThe data support a conceptual model of Hox-specified positional identities in adult blood vessels, which is of likely relevance for understanding the mechanisms underlying regional physiological diversities in the cardiovascular system. The data also demonstrate that conventional Hox reporter gene mice are useful tools for visualizing complex Hox expression patterns in the vascular network that might be unattainable otherwise.

One year after surgery, the patient was in good condition and the examination showed no signs of infection.\nThe thus demonstrated treatment concept with insertion of well-vascularized tissues in combination with a specific antibiotic regime in our hands proved to be an additional option for the successful management of life-threatening infections of a sternal osteomyelitis in combination of an infected aortic graft.", "journal": "Eplasty", "date": "2008-09-26", "authors": ["Dominik WSchmid", "ChristinaOrasch-J\u00f6rg", "RetoWettstein", "Daniel FKalbermatten", "AtanasTodorov", "GerhardPierer"], "doi": null}

The longitudinal trapezius fasciocutaneous flap was first introduced in 1996; at that time it did not receive much attention, although it has many significant benefits compared with other available procedures. Sixteen trapezius fasciocutaneous flaps were elevated in 15 patients for reconstruction of severe scarring of the neck and midface. All flaps were based on the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and included the overlying fascia of the trapezius muscle. Delaying was applied for very long flaps. Two flaps developed minimal distal necrosis (<5 cm) due to longer pedicles (>10 cm below the muscle border). The results indicate that an extra-long back fascia flap based on the descending branch of the transverse cervical artery could be formed, which would be long enough to reconstruct the entire neck and safely transfer it to the midface.

Hypoxia offers the potential for anaerobic bacteria colonization and tumor destruction by the bacteria, and dormant spores of wild-type Clostridium perfringens (Cp) germinate and proliferate within the hypoxic cores of pancreatic tumors in mice. However, the oncopathic effects of Cp were limited by host inflammatory responses and by Cp's residual tolerance to oxygen, which caused toxic effects in animals.\nRecombinant Cp strains in which superoxide dismutase, a major oxygen tolerance gene, was deleted (Cp/sod(-)) were constructed to enhance its selective growth in tumors. In addition, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), an inflammation-suppressing gene from Staphylococcus aureus, was inserted into the Cp/sod(-) genome to enhance its oncopathic potency. The ability of the recombinant Cp strains to kill tumors was investigated in C57/BL6 mice bearing murine PANC02 tumors. Systemic and organ toxic effects were assessed by monitoring serum chemistries and histopathological examination. Statistical tests were two-sided.\nCp/sod(-) showed reduced toxic effects compared with wild-type Cp when spores were administered intravenously into PANC02 tumor-bearing mice. Mice treated with Cp/sod(-)/PVL spores demonstrated a reduction in neutrophils and macrophages in tumors, logarithmically elevated growth of intratumoral bacteria, enhanced tumor necrosis, and substantially prolonged survival without apparent systemic and organ toxic effects, compared with mice treated with both wild-type Cp and Cp/sod(-) spores. Accordingly, 47% of Cp/sod(-)/PVL-treated mice (n = 15) achieved tumor-free survival for over 120 days, whereas all mice treated with Cp/sod(-) or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 10 per group) died within 50 days.

Previously, we have shown that the overexpression of prokineticin receptor-1 (PKR1) in transgenic (TG) mouse hearts induced neovascularization. Since PKR1 and PKR2 are 85% identical and expressed in cardiovascular tissues, we hypothesized that PKR2 may also contribute to cardiomyocyte growth and vascularization.\nWe have generated TG mice overexpressing PKR2 in cardiomyocytes. TG mice exhibit increased hypertrophic gene expression and heart-to-body weight ratio accompanied by an increased length of cardiomyocytes at the age of 12 weeks. Increased left ventricular end-systolic and diastolic diameters without cardiac dysfunction at the age of 24 weeks indicate that TG mice have an eccentric hypertrophy with compensated cardiac function. Quantitative morphological analysis showed that TG hearts have a normal microvessel density and number of branch points. However, they exhibit increased abnormal endothelial cell shape and ultrastructure, changed cellular distribution of a tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), and vascular leakage in heart without a rise of angiogenic factor levels at early and late age. The application of media conditioned by H9c2 cardioblast cells overexpressing PKR2 significantly induced impaired ZO-1 localization in H5V endothelial cells, mimicking the TG model.\nThese findings provide the first genetic evidence that cardiomyocyte PKR2 signalling leads to eccentric hypertrophy in an autocrine regulation and impaired endothelial integrity in a paracrine regulation without inducing angiogenesis.

No mesh support (group I) was compared with external nitinol meshes at three different sizes: loose fitting (group II), 25% diameter constricting (group III), and 50% diameter constricting (group IV).

Many of the treated patients have regained life-enhancing function depending upon their injury level, such as walking with assistive devices, partial hand function, urination, sexual sensation, etc. Although sophisticated surgeries, the basic concept is theoretically simple: a functional nerve from above the injury site is rerouted and connected to a paralysis-affected peripheral nerve below the injury site. This Chapter summarizes more than a dozen rerouting procedures, which restore function that range from breathing to toe sensation. This summary discusses the indications and criteria for choosing the best donor nerve based on the specific injury level, and emphasizes major procedural features such as the use of selected interfascicular anastomosis, modified end-to-side suture techniques, vascularized donor nerves, a muscle trigger for the synchronized contraction of congenerous muscles, and reconstruction procedures to restore donor-nerve function.", "journal": "Surgical technology international", "date": "2008-09-20", "authors": ["ShaoChengZhang", "YanWang", "LauranceJohnston"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Cytoarchitecture of Utricularia nutritive tissue.", "abstract": "Beginning with light microscopy studies in the late 19th century, the placental \"nutritive tissue\" in carnivorous plants of Utricularia spp. has been well described by several authors. Based on observations of direct contact between the embryo sac and the \"nutritive tissue\" and the lack of vascularization of the ovule, it has been suggested that this nutritive tissue plays a key role in the nutrition of the female gametophyte. To date, however, the structure of this tissue has received only scant attention. To fill this knowledge gap, we have characterized its anatomy and histochemistry in more detail and addressed the speculations of a number of earlier researchers. Nutritive tissue during the period of flower opening in three Utricularia species, each belonging to different sections and subgenera (Polypompholyx, Bivalvaria and Utricularia), was examined by light and, in particular, electron microscopy. In all of the investigated species, nutritive tissue cells differ from placental parenchyma cells in having no huge vacuole, no large amyloplasts with starch grains, and no protein inclusions in the nucleus. The funicular nutritive tissue in U. dichotoma consists of active cells with a secretory character, while U. sandersonii has a small placental nutritive tissue consisting of colenchymatous cells accumulating lipids. The most complex nutritive tissue occurs in aquatic U. intermedia, which occupies a derived position in the genus phylogeny. In this latter species, the cells of this tissue resemble meristematic cells in having a relatively large nucleus, thin cell walls, and reduced vacuoles, but the well-developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in some cells is similar to that in secretory cells. The cytoplasm is rich in microtubules, some of which are in close contact with the ER cisternae. We found very thick cell walls between nutritive tissue cells and parenchyma cells, but plasmodesmata between these types of cells are rare. Similarities in both the position and structure of nutritive tissue in Polypompholyx and section Pleiochasia support their classification together in one subgenus, based on results from a molecular study.

Mice receiving a preparative regimen of nonmyeloablating (5 Gy) total body irradiation experienced the rapid rejection of tumor-specific allogeneic lymphocytes with no impact on tumor growth. However, when mice were given more intense total body irradiation conditioning regimens combined with autologous bone marrow transplantation, adoptively transferred allogeneic tumor-specific T lymphocytes persisted at detectable levels for several weeks and mediated significant regression of large, vascularized tumors. We found that the risk of GVHD was low when tumor-specific T cells were transferred and significant toxicity was observed only when substantial numbers of open repertoire allogeneic naive T cells were mixed with the tumor-specific lymphocytes.

{"title": "Requirement of vasculogenesis and blood circulation in late stages of liver growth in zebrafish.", "abstract": "Early events in vertebrate liver development have been the major focus in previous studies, however, late events of liver organogenesis remain poorly understood. Liver vasculogenesis in vertebrates occurs through the interaction of endoderm-derived liver epithelium and mesoderm-derived endothelial cells (ECs). In zebrafish, although it has been found that ECs are not required for liver budding, how and when the spatio-temporal pattern of liver growth is coordinated with ECs remains to be elucidated.\nTo study the process of liver development and vasculogenesis in vivo, a two-color transgenic zebrafish line Tg(lfabf:dsRed; elaA:EGFP) was generated and named LiPan for liver-specific expression of DsRed RFP and exocrine pancreas-specific expression of GFP. Using the LiPan line, we first followed the dynamic development of liver from live embryos to adult and showed the formation of three distinct yet connected liver lobes during development. The LiPan line was then crossed with Tg(fli1:EGFP)y1 and vascular development in the liver was traced in vivo. Liver vasculogenesis started at 55-58 hpf when ECs first surrounded hepatocytes from the liver bud surface and then invaded the liver to form sinusoids and later the vascular network. Using a novel non-invasive and label-free fluorescence correction spectroscopy, we detected blood circulation in the liver starting at approximately 72 hpf. To analyze the roles of ECs and blood circulation in liver development, both cloche mutants (lacking ECs) and Tnnt2 morphants (no blood circulation) were employed. We found that until 70 hpf liver growth and morphogenesis depended on ECs and nascent sinusoids. After 72 hpf, a functional sinusoidal network was essential for continued liver growth. An absence of blood circulation in Tnnt2 morphants caused defects in liver vasculature and small liver.\nThere are two phases of liver development in zebrafish, budding and growth. In the growth phase, there are three distinct stages: avascular growth between 50-55 hpf, where ECs are not required; endothelium-dependent growth, where ECs or sinusoids are required for liver growth between 55-72 hpf before blood circulation in liver sinusoids; and circulation-dependent growth, where the circulation is essential to maintain vascular network and to support continued liver growth after 72 hpf.", "journal": "BMC developmental biology", "date": "2008-09-18", "authors": ["SvetlanaKorzh", "XiufangPan", "MartaGarcia-Lecea", "Cecilia LannyWinata", "XiaotaoPan", "ThorstenWohland", "VladimirKorzh", "ZhiyuanGong"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-213X-8-84\n10.1016/S0925-4773(01)00330-6\n10.1016/S0925-4773(02)00328-3\n10.1016/S0012-1606(02)00034-9\n10.1016/S0012-1606(02)00017-9\n10.1016/S0925-4773(02)00327-1\n10.1038/ng1961\n10.1186/1471-213X-7-117\n10.1126/science.1063889\n10.1006/dbio.1998.8887\n10.1006/dbio.2002.0711\n10.1117/1.2435173\n10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00157-1\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.01.016\n10.1006/dbio.2000.9995\n10.1242/dev.01411\n10.1038/ng875\n10.1111/j.1095-8649.1991.tb04399.x\n10.1038/376062a0\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.03.526\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.29.705\n10.1002/bip.1978.360170208\n10.1063/1.2740053\n10.1101/gad.1366405"}

The expression of peroxiredoxin I was also studied to verify the potential relationship between cellular metabolism and microvascular density. Microvascular density for CD34 and CD105 were significantly lower in carcinomas with myoepithelial differentiation. However, no correlation was found between degree of angiogenesis and amounts of myoepithelial cells. High-grade peroxiredoxin I expression was found in 73.7% of mucoepidermoid carcinomas, whereas 85.1% of carcinomas with myoepithelial differentiation presented low-grade expression. In conclusion, carcinomas with myoepithelial differentiation, regardless of the amounts of myoepithelial cells, are associated to a significantly lower vascular density.

Little has been written instead about the vascularization of the supraclavicular skin itself for the use as a free flap. The purpose of this anatomical study was to assess the vascularization of the supraclavicular skin and the possibility of finding an adequate pedicle to harvest it as a free flap in order to close the donor site directly.\nA total of 25 cadavers, 10 formalin fixed and 15 fresh, have been studied in cooperation with the Division for Clinical-Functional Anatomy, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria and the Laboratoire d'Anatomie, Universite\u00e9 R.

{"title": "Material-based deployment enhances efficacy of endothelial progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Cell-based therapies are attractive for revascularizing and regenerating tissues and organs, but clinical trials of endothelial progenitor cell transplantation have not resulted in consistent benefit. We propose a different approach in which a material delivery system is used to create a depot of vascular progenitor cells in vivo that exit over time to repopulate the damaged tissue and participate in regeneration of a vascular network. Microenvironmental conditions sufficient to maintain the viability and outward migration of outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) have been delineated, and a material incorporating these signals improved engraftment of transplanted cells in ischemic murine hindlimb musculature, and increased blood vessel densities from 260 to 670 vessels per mm(2), compared with direct cell injection. Further, material deployment dramatically improved the efficacy of these cells in salvaging ischemic murine limbs, whereas bolus OEC delivery was ineffective in preventing toe necrosis and foot loss. Finally, material deployment of a combination of OECs with another cell population commonly isolated from peripheral or cord blood, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) returned perfusion to normal levels in 40 days, and prevented toe and foot necrosis. Direct injection of an EPC/OEC combination was minimally effective in improving limb perfusion, and untreated limbs underwent autoamputation in 3 days. These results demonstrate that vascular progenitor cell utility is highly dependent on the mode of delivery, and suggest that one can create new vascular beds for a variety of applications with this material-controlled deployment of cells.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2008-09-17", "authors": ["Eduardo ASilva", "Eun-SukKim", "Hyun JoonKong", "David JMooney"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0803873105"}
{"title": "Flt-1 signaling in macrophages promotes glioma growth in vivo.", "abstract": "Several lines of evidence indicate that Flt-1, a fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, which binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF, is a positive regulator of angiogenesis in the context of tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular basis of its action is still not clear. Besides endothelial cells, Flt-1 is also expressed by other different cell types, including myeloid hematopoeitic cells (monocytes and macrophages). To examine the functions of Flt-1 expressed by bone marrow-derived myeloid cells in supporting tumor growth and angiogenesis, Flt-1 tyrosine kinase-deficient (Flt-1 TK-/-) bone marrow cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. After hematopoietic reconstitution, we orthotopically implanted syngeneic wild-type glioma cells or glioma cells overexpressing either VEGF(164) or PlGF-2. Loss of Flt-1 signaling in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells led to a significant decrease in tumor volume and vascularization in gliomas. VEGF but not PlGF overexpressed by glioma cells restored the tumor growth rate in Flt-1 TK-/- bone marrow chimera. VEGF and PlGF overexpression by tumor cells induced an accumulation of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells into tumor tissue. This infiltration was decreased in tumors grown in Flt-1 TK-/- bone marrow chimeras. When investigating chemokines and growth factors involved in myeloid cell recruitment, we determined elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 levels in VEGF- and PlGF-overexpressing tumors. Collectively, these results suggest that Flt-1 signaling in myeloid cells is essential to amplify the angiogenic response and to promote glioma growth.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2008-09-17", "authors": ["MarkKerber", "YvonneReiss", "AnkeWickersheim", "ManfredJugold", "FabianKiessling", "MatthiasHeil", "VadimTchaikovski", "JohannesWaltenberger", "MasabumiShibuya", "Karl HPlate", "Marcia ReginaMachein"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6241"}
{"title": "Science of composite tissue allotransplantation.", "abstract": "The science of composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is rooted in progressive thinking by surgeons, fueled by innovative solutions, and aided by understanding the immunology of tolerance and rejection. These three factors have allowed CTA to progress from science fiction to science fact. Research using preclinical animal models has allowed an understanding of the antigenicity of complex tissue transplants and mechanisms to promote graft acceptance. As a result, translation to the clinic has shown that CTA is a viable treatment option well on the way of becoming a standard of care for those who have lost extremities and suffered large tissue defects. The field of CTA has been progressing exponentially over the past decade. Transplantation of hands, larynx, vascularized knee, trachea, face, and abdominal wall has been performed. Several important observations have emerged from translation to the clinic. Although it was predicted that rejection would pose a major limitation, this has not proven true. In fact, steroid-sparing protocols for immunosuppression that have been successfully used in renal transplantation are sufficient to prevent rejection of limbs. Although skin is highly antigenic when transplanted alone in animal models, when part of a CTA, it has not proven to be. Chronic rejection has not been conclusively demonstrated in hand transplant recipients and is difficult to induce in rodent models of CTA.

To determine which cell lineages in the eye had Cre recombinase activity, Six3-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with ROSA-26 reporter mice, and lacZ activity was assayed. Histologic analysis, immunofluorescence, and TUNEL labeling were performed from embryonic day (E)12.5 to postnatal stages to analyze vascularization, cell proliferation, retinal organization, and apoptosis.\nOn conditional disruption of Fzd5 specifically in the retina, but not in vitreous hyaloid vasculature (VHV), an abnormal accumulation consisting of pericytes and endothelial cells was observed in the vitreous as early as E12.5. The abundant retrolental cells persisted into postnatal stages and appeared as a pigmented intravitreal mass. In Fzd5 CKO mice there was failure of normal apoptosis of the VHV, and cells in the persistent VHV were maintained in the cell cycle up to postnatal day 23. Moreover, morphogenesis of the retina adjacent to the vasculature was disrupted, leading to retinal folds, detachment, and abnormal lamination. This phenotype is similar to that of human eye disease persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV).\nSelective loss of Fzd5 in the retina results in PHPV and retinal defects through an apparently cell-nonautonomous effect, revealing a potential requirement for retina-derived signals in regulating the development of the VHV.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2008-09-16", "authors": ["JianminZhang", "SabineFuhrmann", "Monica LVetter"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.08-2226"}

Murine corneas were vascularized by using a suture-induced neovascularization assay. For immunohistochemistry, flatmounts of the vascularized corneas were stained with LYVE-1 as a specific lymphatic vascular endothelial marker and with CD31 as panendothelial marker. Morphometry of corneal hem and lymphangiogenesis was performed semi-automatically on digital images using image analysis software. Data were analyzed by a paired t-test, intraclass-correlation and systemic difference analysis compared to a manual method. The semiautomatic method based on threshold analysis was more valid in measuring the area covered by blood or lymphatic vessels. Both methods had a good reproducibility with respect to both vessel types (blood vessels: manual: 0.969, semiautomatic: 0.982; lymphatic vessels: manual: 0.951, semiautomatic: 0.966), whereas the systemic difference was significant for both groups measuring lymphatic vessels (manual: p<0.003; semiautomatic: p<0.035) and for the manual method measuring blood vessels (manual: p<0.0001; semiautomatic: p<0.419). The new semiautomatic morphometry method based on threshold analysis provides higher accuracy, is more valid than and at least as reproducible and objective as the manual outlining method.

To assess the responses to irradiation and vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition (by the vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor PTK787/ZK222854), mammary carcinoma allografts were investigated by vascular casting; electron, light, and confocal microscopy; and immunoblotting. Irradiation and anti-angiogenic therapy had similar effects on the tumor vasculature. Both treatments reduced tumor vascularization, particularly in the tumor medulla. After cessation of therapy, the tumor vasculature expanded predominantly by intussusception with a plexus composed of enlarged sinusoidal-like vessels containing multiple transluminal tissue pillars. Tumor revascularization originated from preserved alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive vessels in the tumor cortex. Quantification revealed that recovery was characterized by an angiogenic switch from sprouting to intussusception. Up-regulated alpha-smooth muscle actin-expression during recovery reflected the recruitment of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells for intussusception as part of the angio-adaptive mechanism. Tumor recovery was associated with a dramatic decrease (by 30% to 40%) in the intratumoral microvascular density, probably as a result of intussusceptive pruning and, surprisingly, with only a minimal reduction of the total microvascular (exchange) area. Therefore, the vascular supply to the tumor was not severely compromised, as demonstrated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression. Both irradiation and anti-angiogenic therapy cause a switch from sprouting to intussusceptive angiogenesis, representing an escape mechanism and accounting for the development of resistance, as well as rapid recovery, after cessation of therapy.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2008-09-13", "authors": ["RuslanHlushchuk", "OliverRiesterer", "OliverBaum", "JeanetteWood", "GuentherGruber", "MartinPruschy", "ValentinDjonov"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2008.071131"}

{"title": "Multimodal cancer treatment: real time monitoring, optimization, and synergistic effects.", "abstract": "The primary objective of this analysis is to provide the theoretical framework for a novel multimodal cancer treatment system emphasizing the use of ultrasound as a synergistic drug release mechanism, real time monitoring by MRI of hyperthermic, pO2, and ultrasound induced released effects. The aim is to provide a cure for the 20% of cancer victims who will die of complications from local solid tumors. Adjuvant therapy usually refers to surgery preceding or following chemotherapy and/or ionizing radiation treatment to decrease the risk of recurrence, but the absolute benefit for survival obtained with adjuvant therapy compared to control is only approximately 6%. Tumor hypoxia represents a primary therapeutic concern, besides multi-drug resistance (MDR), because it can reduce the effectiveness of drugs and radiotherapy; well-oxygenated cells require one-third the dose of hypoxic cells to achieve a given level of cell killing. The era of systemic and indiscriminate chemotherapeutic drug delivery into both healthy and pathologic tissues is near an end. Targeted drug delivery using nanoparticles is emerging as the new vehicle, either as a single treatment option, as part of adjuvant procedures or as a component of a multimodal cancer treatment system. There are more than 100 nanosized liposomes or particles, and conjugated anticancer agents in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. Active targeting can be achieved by site-specific delivery or site-specific triggering. Ultrasound can be utilized as both a site triggering and synergistic mechanism in drug release. The process can be monitored using MRI by a physical process called cavitation. An analysis of low frequency ultrasound exposure in combination with liposomally encapsulated doxorubicin (Caelyx) on Balb/c nude mice inoculated with a WiDr (human colon cancer) tumor cell line provided tumor growth inhibition of 30-40%. Mild hyperthermia causes mean intra-tumor pO2 to increase by 25% and enhances tumor radiosensitization. Hyperthermia causes the extravasation of liposome nanoparticles in deep tumor regions. Ionizing radiation improves the distribution and uptake of drugs. Liposomally encapsulated drugs and ultrasound mediated hyperthermia have been proven to circumvent MDR effects. Hyperthermic effects and pO2 monitoring of bodily fluid have been performed by MRI. It is hypothesized that increased vascularization and subsequent increase in pO2 levels to hypoxic regions, and monitoring of drug release through cavitation, can facilitate optimized real time concomitant or sequential treatments of drug therapy, hyperthermia, ionizing radiation, etc., before or after surgery.

{"title": "Predicting drug pharmacokinetics and effect in vascularized tumors using computer simulation.", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the pharmacokinetics and effect of doxorubicin and cisplatin in vascularized tumors through two-dimensional simulations. We take into account especially vascular and morphological heterogeneity as well as cellular and lesion-level pharmacokinetic determinants like P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux and cell density. To do this we construct a multi-compartment PKPD model calibrated from published experimental data and simulate 2-h bolus administrations followed by 18-h drug washout. Our results show that lesion-scale drug and nutrient distribution may significantly impact therapeutic efficacy and should be considered as carefully as genetic determinants modulating, for example, the production of multidrug-resistance protein or topoisomerase II. We visualize and rigorously quantify distributions of nutrient, drug, and resulting cell inhibition. A main result is the existence of significant heterogeneity in all three, yielding poor inhibition in a large fraction of the lesion, and commensurately increased serum drug concentration necessary for an average 50% inhibition throughout the lesion (the IC(50) concentration). For doxorubicin the effect of hypoxia and hypoglycemia (\"nutrient effect\") is isolated and shown to further increase cell inhibition heterogeneity and double the IC(50), both undesirable. We also show how the therapeutic effectiveness of doxorubicin penetration therapy depends upon other determinants affecting drug distribution, such as cellular efflux and density, offering some insight into the conditions under which otherwise promising therapies may fail and, more importantly, when they will succeed. Cisplatin is used as a contrast to doxorubicin since both published experimental data and our simulations indicate its lesion distribution is more uniform than that of doxorubicin. Because of this some of the complexity in predicting its therapeutic efficacy is mitigated. Using this advantage, we show results suggesting that in vitro monolayer assays using this drug may more accurately predict in vivo performance than for drugs like doxorubicin.

We perform nonlinear simulations of the multi-scale model that demonstrate the importance of the coupling between the development and remodeling of the vascular network, the blood flow through the network and the tumour progression. Consistent with clinical observations, the hydrostatic stress generated by tumour cell proliferation shuts down large portions of the vascular network dramatically affecting the flow, the subsequent network remodeling, the delivery of nutrients to the tumour and the subsequent tumour progression. In addition, extracellular matrix degradation by tumour cells is seen to have a dramatic affect on both the development of the vascular network and the growth response of the tumour.

{"title": "Cathepsin proteases have distinct roles in trophoblast function and vascular remodelling.", "abstract": "Trophoblast giant cells are instrumental in promoting blood flow towards the mouse embryo by invading the uterine endometrium and remodelling the maternal vasculature. This process involves the degradation of the perivascular smooth muscle layer and the displacement of vascular endothelial cells to form trophoblast-lined blood sinuses. How this vascular remodelling is achieved at the molecular level remains largely elusive. Here, we show that two placenta-specific cathepsins, Cts7 and Cts8, are expressed in distinct but largely overlapping subsets of giant cells that are in direct contact with maternal arteries. We find that Cts8, but not Cts7, has the capacity to mediate loss of smooth muscle alpha-actin and to disintegrate blood vessels. Consequently, conditional ubiquitous overexpression of Cts8 leads to midgestational embryonic lethality caused by severe vascularization defects. In addition, both cathepsins determine trophoblast cell fate by inhibiting the self-renewing capacity of trophoblast stem cells when overexpressed in vitro. Similarly, transgenic overexpression of Cts7 and Cts8 affects trophoblast proliferation and differentiation by prolonging mitotic cell cycle progression and promoting giant cell differentiation, respectively. We also show that the cell cycle effect is directly caused by some proportion of CTS7 localizing to the nucleus, highlighting the emerging functional diversity of these typically lysosomal proteases in distinct intracellular compartments.

Insufficient CG-H production and the resulting inappropriate implantation is associated with an unduly high incidence of pregnancy failures in humans.

{"title": "Endoscopic reconstruction of the cranial base using a pedicled nasoseptal flap.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of the cranial base using vascularized tissue promotes rapid and complete healing, thus avoiding complications caused by persistent communication between the cranial cavity and the sinonasal tract. The Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap (HBF), a neurovascular pedicled flap of the nasal septum mucoperiosteum and mucoperichondrium based on the nasoseptal artery, seems to be advantageous for the reconstruction of the cranial base after endonasal cranial base surgery.\nWe performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent endonasal cranial base surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from January 30, 2006 to January 30, 2007, identifying patients who experienced reconstruction with a vascularized septal mucosal flap (HBF). We analyzed the demographic data, pathological characteristics, site and extent of resection, use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion techniques, and outcome.\nSeventy-five patients who underwent endonasal cranial base endoscopic surgery received repair with the HBF. In this population, we encountered eight postoperative CSF leaks (10.66%), all in patients who required intra-arachnoidal dissection. When we correct the statistical analysis to include only patients with intra- arachnoidal lesions, the postoperative CSF leak rate is 14.5% (eight of 55 patients). It is notable that six CSF (33%) leaks occurred in our first 25 repairs, whereas we encountered only two postoperative leaks (4%) in the last 50 patients. The corrected CSF leak rate, considering only intra-arachnoidal lesions, was two (5.4%) of 37 patients. This improvement in the CSF leak rate reflects our growing experience and comfort with this reconstructive technique. All of our failures could be matched to a specific technical mistake. In addition, we modified the flap-harvesting technique to allow for staged procedures and the removal of caudal lesions. These special circumstances require storage of the flap in the antrum during the removal of caudal lesions, and suturing of the flap in its original position for staged procedures. One patient experienced a posterior nose bleed from the posterior nasal artery. This was controlled with bipolar electrocautery, thereby preserving the flap blood supply. We encountered no infectious or wound complications in this series of patients. The donor site accumulates crusting, which requires debridement until mucosalization is complete; this usually occurs 6 to 12 weeks after surgery.\nThe HBF is a versatile and reliable reconstructive technique for repairing defects of the anterior, middle, clival, and parasellar cranial base.

Although the consequences of HIF-1alpha inactivation in cancer cells have been widely investigated, only a few studies have addressed the role of HIF-1alpha in the survival of cancer cells endowed with different glycolytic capacities. In this study, we investigated this aspect in ovarian cancer cells. Hypoxia-induced toxicity was increased in highly glycolytic cells compared with poorly glycolytic cells; it was also associated with a sharp decrease in intracellular ATP levels and was prevented by glucose supplementation. Stable HIF-1alpha silencing enhanced hypoxia-induced cell death in vitro due to a lack of cell cycle arrest. Tumors bearing attenuated HIF-1alpha levels had similar growth rates and vascularization as did controls, but tumors showed higher proliferation levels and increased necrosis. Moreover, tumors formed by HIF-1alpha deficient cells had higher levels of lactate and lower ATP concentrations than controls as shown by metabolic imaging.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumor biopsies was also analyzed applying anti-VEGF antibodies.\nEC labeled with at least one of the studied markers were detected in 47 (34.3%) primary colorectal cancers (30% chromogranin A-positive, 33% synaptophysin-positive and 18% serotonin-positive). In 23% of tumor biopsies, VEGF-positive EC were also detected. The immunostaining on serial sections showed that some chromogranin A-, synaptophysin- or serotonin-positive EC also contained VEGF immune deposits.

Despite its importance in neurobiology, little is known about how this structure forms.\nHere we show that the transposon-mediated enhancer trap zebrafish line Et(Mn16) expresses green fluorescent protein within a population of cells that migrate toward the midline and coalesce to form the definitive CP.

Utilizing pharmacologic pan-notch inhibition and specific morpholino-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate a requirement for Notch signaling in choroid plexus development. We identify three Notch signaling pathway members as mediating this effect, notch1b, deltaA, and deltaD.\nThis work is the first to identify the zebrafish choroid plexus and to characterize its epithelial and vasculature integration. This study, in the context of other comparative anatomical studies, strongly indicates a conserved mechanism for development of the CP. Finally, we characterize a requirement for Notch signaling in the developing CP. This establishes the zebrafish CP as an important new system for the determination of key signaling pathways in the formation of this essential component of the vertebrate brain.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2008-09-05", "authors": ["Brent RBill", "DariusBalciunas", "Joshua AMcCarra", "Eric DYoung", "TouaXiong", "Ashley MSpahn", "MartaGarcia-Lecea", "VladimirKorzh", "Stephen CEkker", "Lisa ASchimmenti"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0003114"}
{"title": "Management of radiation-associated fractures.", "abstract": "High-dose radiation is injurious to bone and is a known risk factor for the development of late fracture. Management of radiation-induced fractures is generally thought to be difficult, with prolonged healing times and a high nonunion rate. There is a relative paucity of literature to guide treatment. Fractures of the long bones typically should be managed with intramedullary nailing. A low threshold should exist for supplemental bone grafting, and a vascularized fibula graft should be considered for persistent nonunion. To prevent refracture, fixation should be left in situ indefinitely. Resection of the fracture site and reconstruction with an oncologic endoprosthesis is an effective salvage procedure. Periarticular fractures should be treated with joint arthroplasty, which allows early mobilization and avoids prolonged healing times. Fractures of expendable bones, primarily the clavicle, typically should be managed with d\u00e9bridement or resection.", "journal": "The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons", "date": "2008-09-05", "authors": ["Christopher PCannon", "Patrick PLin", "Valerae OLewis", "Alan WYasko"], "doi": null}

Here, we show that CD11c(+)DEC205(+) DCs coexpressing alpha-smooth muscle actin and VE-cadherin home to perivascular areas in the ovarian cancer microenvironment and are required for the maintenance of tumor vasculature. Consequently, depletion of DCs in mice bearing established ovarian cancer by targeting different specific markers significantly delays tumor growth and enhances the effect of standard chemotherapies. Tumor growth restriction was associated with vascular apoptosis after DC ablation followed by necrosis, which triggered an antitumor immunogenic boost.

An additional cell type being studied in the field of tumor vascularization is the circulating endothelial cell (CEC), whose presence in elevated numbers reflects vascular injury. Levels of EPCs and CECs are reported to correlate with tumor stage and have been evaluated as biomarkers of the efficacy of anticancer/antiangiogenic treatments. Furthermore, because EPCs and subtypes of proangiogenic HCs are actively participating in capillary growth, these cells are attractive potential vehicles for delivering therapeutic molecules.

After a flap failure, the decision is often made to perform a second, reoperative free flap.\nA retrospective review of all microsurgical free tissue transfers performed at the authors' institution identified 13 patients who underwent a second, reoperative free flap after a failed primary flap. The records of these patients were reviewed, with particular emphasis on identifying changes in treatment strategy between the initially failed and the reoperative free flap.\nThirteen patients were identified as having undergone a reoperative free flap. In nine of 13 primary free flaps, at least one likely cause for the failure was identified (69 percent). In the approach to the second free flap, strategy changes were performed in 10 of 13 cases (77 percent); 11 were successful (85 percent). One of the two patients with a failed reoperative free flap underwent a third attempt at free tissue transfer, which also failed.\nThe authors' overall approach to the failed free flap includes the following four steps: (1) reconsideration of the need for vascularized free tissue transfer, (2) a sensitive psychosocial approach to the patient and family, (3) analysis of the cause of the first flap failure, and (4) change in microsurgical strategy.

The diverse functions of Eph/ephrin are largely related to the complementary expression pattern of the Eph receptors and corresponding ephrin ligands that are expressed in adjacent compartments, although overlapping expression pattern also exists in epithelial tissue.

Two patients were treated with a single session of PDT using the standard parameters of the Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy (VIP) study: a 34-year-old man whose previously stationary juxtapapillary retinal astrocytoma, secondary to tuberous sclerosis, progressed within 7 months to involve the foveola; and a 68-year-old man whose acquired retinal astrocytoma progressed over 18 months in spite of standard photocoagulation. Both tumours were vascularized and had caused secondary lipid exudation and an exudative retinal detachment. Outcome measures were visual acuity, resorption of subretinal fluid, tumour height and fluorescein angiography.\nThe progressing, vascularized part of both retinal astrocytomas regressed, with little change in the poorly vascularized, stationary part of the congenital hamartoma. Visual acuity improved in the first patient and was unchanged in the second by 3 months, with stable vision in both and no sign of recurrence at 2 years. The exudative retinal detachments resolved completely. Tumour height reduced a median of 30%. Regression was associated with obliteration of tumour vessels within the progressing part of the lesion, with closure of some of the dilated retinal capillaries over the tumour. Intraretinal microvascular abnormalities and scattered haemorrhages appeared outside the treated area in the first patient.\nPDT with verteporfin can induce regression of progressive, vascularized, aggressive retinal astrocytomas and may prevent typical progression to total retinal detachment and enucleation, whether the astrocytoma is associated with tuberous sclerosis or not.

Our objectives were to determine if acellular dermal matrix (ADM) grafts resisted Staphylococcus aureus infection better (as measured by ability to reduce or clear bacterial counts) than synthetic (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) mesh when used in abdominal wall reconstruction, and to determine whether vascularization of the implant occurred. We hypothesized that the ability of the ADM grafts to vascularize and allow cellular ingrowth would allow the immune system to clear the infection better in these animals.\nIn New Zealand White rabbits (average weight, 3.0 kg), a full-thickness 3 x 3 cm(2) abdominal defect was created, then repaired with an interpositional implant (ADM, n = 62; PTFE, n = 57). Before skin closure, the epidermal surface of each implant was inoculated with 1 mL of S. aureus at various concentrations (10(4) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL, n = 82; 10(6) CFU/mL, n = 27; 10(9) CFU/mL, n = 10), and the rabbits were harvested at either day 7 or day 21.\nAt day 7, ADM grafts inoculated with 10(4) CFU had lower counts or no bacteria (p = 0.006), fewer adhesions (p = 0.005), and fewer abscesses (p = 0.008) than PTFE grafts. By day 21, more ADM (n = 12) than PTFE (n = 0) grafts were free of bacteria (p = 0.002). Fewer rabbits with ADM grafts formed abscesses (13 vs. 19; p = 0.03). When evaluating the 7- and 21-day 10(4) CFU groups combined, a total of 15 rabbits with ADM cleared the bacteria completely vs. none of those with PTFE grafts (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in bacterial counts or wound complications at days 7 or 21 between PTFE and ADM implants when inoculated with 10(6) CFU. All rabbits inoculated with 10(9) CFU died of sepsis within 48 h. Herniation did not occur in any of the animals.\nOur study demonstrates that ADM resists surgical site infection caused by S. aureus in an animal model without compromising the ventral hernia repair.

To address the contributions of PAR1 and PAR2 to breast cancer development, we established cohorts of mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle T (PyMT) PAR1(-/-) and PAR2(-/-) mice, considering that the PyMT model recapitulates aspects of human disease. Appearance of palpable tumors, tumor expansion, and metastasis was indistinguishable between wild-type and PAR1(-/-) mice. PAR1(-/-) breast cancer cells were no longer responsive to thrombin in vitro, excluding compensatory up-regulation of alternative thrombin receptors and indicating that thrombin-PAR1 signaling is dispensable in breast tumor microenvironments. In contrast, palpable tumors and multifocal disease developed slower in PAR2(-/-) mice, and as a consequence of delayed tumor onset, metastasis was reduced. Analysis of early tumors showed persistence of adenomas with delayed appearance of vascularized adenocarcinomas in PAR2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, CXCL1 production by early PAR2(-/-) tumors was reduced. These results are consistent with previous xenograft data that implicated breast cancer PAR2 signaling in the induction of proangiogenic growth factors and chemokines.

However, the sensitivity is limited to vessels larger than capillaries. Contrast-enhanced HF-VPDU reveals all perfused vessels by assessing stimulated acoustic emissions from disintegrating microbubbles. Thus, we investigated whether flow-sensitive and contrast-enhanced HF-VPDU can depict different vessel fractions and assess their early response to antiangiogenic therapy. Mice with A431 tumors were scanned before and after administration of polybutylcyanoacrylate microbubbles by HF-VPDU. Animals received either antiangiogenic treatment (SU11248) or a control substance and were imaged repeatedly over 9 days. At each time point, tumors were removed for immunohistochemical analysis. During growth of untreated tumors, vascularization decreased correspondingly on flow-sensitive and contrast-enhanced scans. Treated tumors showed a significantly (P < 0.05) stronger decline in vascularization than controls, which was more pronounced in contrast-enhanced scans. Surprisingly, whereas vascularization remained low in contrast-enhanced scans, flow-sensitive ultrasound indicated a reincrease after day 6 with a higher vascularization than the controls at day 9. Histologic evaluation indicated that immature vessels degraded markedly on therapy, whereas large mature vessels on the tumor periphery were more therapy resistant and drew closer due to tumor shrinkage. In conclusion, contrast-enhanced HF-VPDU and flow-sensitive HF-VPDU are both capable of assessing the effects of antiangiogenic therapy.

In all cases conservative management with methotrexate resulted in undetectable serum beta-hCG, a decrease in the size of partial placenta retained, and undetectable vascularization.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental obstetrics & gynecology", "date": "2008-08-30", "authors": ["SPinho", "SSarzedas", "SPedroso", "ASantos", "MRebord\u00e3o", "TAvillez", "ECasal", "MHermida"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Reduction of brain metastases in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-deficient mice with transgenic ocular tumors.", "abstract": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is known to play a paradoxical positive role in tumor angiogenesis, but its contribution to metastatic spread remains unclear. We studied the impact of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 deficiency in a transgenic mouse model of ocular tumors originating from retinal epithelial cells and leading to brain metastasis (TRP-1/SV40 Tag mice). PAI-1 deficiency did not affect primary tumor growth or vascularization, but was associated with a smaller number of brain metastases. Brain metastases were found to be differentially distributed between the two genotypes. PAI-1-deficient mice displayed mostly secondary foci expanding from local optic nerve infiltration, whereas wild-type animals displayed more disseminated nodules in the scissura and meningeal spaces. SuperArray GEarray analyses aimed at detecting molecules potentially compensating for PAI-1 deficiency demonstrated an increase in fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) gene expression in primary tumors, which was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Our data provide the first evidence of a key role for PAI-1 in a spontaneous model of metastasis and suggest that angiogenic factors, such as FGF-1, may be important for primary tumor growth and may compensate for the absence of PAI-1.

Bruch's membrane was perforated with a retinal perforator at a site where the overlying neuroretina was normal. Eyes were enucleated in a time interval between 30 min and 42 days after the perforation, and the pigs were subsequently killed. Immediately prior to enucleation, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms were obtained. Sections of paraffin-embedded eyes were immunohistochemically stained.\nOn fluorescein angiography, membranes aged 14 days or less exhibited leakage in 10/11 cases while the remaining showed persistent staining. The propensity to leak diminished with time and only 1/3 of the oldest membranes leaked. In eyes enucleated immediately after surgery, neuroretinas overlying the induced lesions were intact without apparent atrophy of cells. At day 3, macrophages and myofibroblasts formed membrane-like structures in the subretinal space. At day 7, the outer surface of the membrane was covered by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and the neuroretinas had suffered damage in the form of outer segment loss. In the time period 14-42 days, the CNV membrane became completely enveloped by RPE cells. The degree of membrane vascularization increased with time and was at its maximum after 42 days. Intact outer segments were identified over the oldest membranes.\nThe formation of surgical CNV membranes followed the normal reparatory pathway and the degree of vascularization of CNV membranes continued to increase during the 42 days. However, propensity to leak diminished with time. We believe that this was because of the fact that RPE cells completely enveloped older membrane and thus prevented leakage from the newly formed vessels.

{"title": "Natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a slowly growing tumor, whose natural history is not completely known. Since the hepatocarcinogenetic process may evolve for years in a stepwise fashion from premalignant to overt HCC, detection of early, better treatable tumors is made possible by surveillance of patients at risk. A 6-month interval surveillance with ultrasound is considered cost-effective, generally leading to the identification of a single < 3 cm tumor in 50-70% of the patients at risk. For greater than 2 cm tumors, demonstration of arterial hypervascularization of the node by sonovue US, triphasic spiral CT or MRI is diagnostic for HCC. The diagnosis of a less than 2 cm in diameter tumor may be more difficult due to the risk of false negative diagnoses with contrast imaging technique (50% of the cases) caused by immature arterial vascularization of the small nodules. Prognosis largely depends on the evolutionary stage at which HCC is detected, i.e. a size and number of HCC nodes, vascular invasiveness and degree of liver impairment. The multinodular pattern of HCC, representing one third of all early cancers, heralds poor prognosis, especially for patients not fitting the Milan criteria for liver transplantation. The best prognosis is for a single, less than 5 cm node in compensated cirrhosis without vascular invasion, since this tumor is amenable to both liver transplantation and hepatic resection which may confer long-term survival Better survivals of cirrhotic patients with a recently identified tumors reflect the application of accurate criteria for tumor staging and stringent criteria for curative treatments.

In our experimental set-up, using a PRF of 0.3 kHz, flow velocities of about 2 cm/s and higher could be registered. Measured VI was overestimated up to 44 times relative to actual VI.\nOur main finding in a laboratory set-up was a considerable overestimation of moving blood volume using 3D power Doppler ultrasound in a single small tube.

One proprietary software package calculates three 3D vascular indices: the vascularization index (VI), the flow index (FI), and the vascularization flow index (VFI). Our aim was to evaluate how different settings affect the Doppler signal in terms of its quantification by these three indices within a 3D dataset.\nA computer-driven 'flow phantom' was used to continuously pump a nylon particle-based blood mimic (Orgasol(trade mark)) around a closed system through a C-flex(trade mark) tube embedded in an agar-based tissue mimic. The test tanks were insonated with a modified 3D transvaginal 4-8-MHz ultrasound transducer (V530D) and power Doppler data were acquired over a series of different settings. Each experiment involved the manipulation of just one Doppler setting in order to study it in isolation.\nAs expected, all of the power Doppler settings, when altered, were found to effect significant changes (P < 0.05) in the VI, FI and VFI. The gain and signal power had the greatest effect, producing no Doppler signals at the lowest settings and the highest recordable indices at the maximum settings. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was the next most influential setting but a Doppler signal was seen and measurable at all of the different settings. The other Doppler settings had a much less profound effect on the vascular indices, with subtle but significantly different measures across the full range of settings. The speed of data acquisition was also found to affect the vascular indices, all of which were reduced when the fast mode was used although the only significant effect was on the VFI.\nThe VI, FI and VFI are all affected significantly by variations in power Doppler settings and by the speed of acquisition. The gain and signal power have the greatest effect on the power Doppler signal, followed closely by the PRF. The other settings and speed of acquisition also influence the signal, but to a much lesser degree.

We next examined the role of Ang-1/Tie2 signaling in the beneficial effect of EPC and SMPC coadministration. Small interfering RNA directed against Ang-1-producing SMPCs or Tie2-expressing EPCs blocked vascular network formation in Matrigel coculture assays, reduced the rate of incorporated EPCs within vascular structure, and abrogated the efficiency of cell therapy. Production of Ang-1 by SMPCs activates Tie2-expressing EPCs, resulting in increase of EPC survival and formation of a stable vascular network.

The procedure involved the removal of scar tissue and the creation of well vascularized dermal beds by skin de-epithelialization (epidermis removal). After that we formed 2 elliptical dermal flaps. Two elliptical buccal mucosa grafts were quilted to the recipient bed (the dermal flap) and anastomosed with the mucosa of the normal part of the channel. The flaps were joined, tubularized and sutured to the skin. An indwelling catheter was left in the channel for 2 weeks. Postoperatively the buccal mucosa was wetted with saline solution for 4 consecutive days.\nFollowup was between 12 and 39 months (mean 22). There was no partial or total graft necrosis. None of the patients experienced repeat stenosis. The stoma was visible (uncovered) and the esthetic appearance was satisfactory in all patients.\nRepair of Mitrofanoff stomal stenosis using a buccal mucosa graft is a minor procedure. It is a good salvage procedure that excludes the need to create a new channel.", "journal": "The Journal of urology", "date": "2008-08-30", "authors": ["Zoran IRadojicic", "Sava VPerovic", "Dzinovic PRados", "Vukovic MPetar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.juro.2008.03.116"}
{"title": "Quality of life evaluation for patients receiving vascularized versus nonvascularized bone graft reconstruction of segmental mandibular defects.", "abstract": "Head and neck neoplasms requiring surgical resection of the mandible can have negative consequences on patient quality of life. For patients with segmental resections, the vascularized fibular free flap and nonvascularized iliac crest are frequently used. The fibula has surpassed the iliac crest in popularity due to the success associated with a vascularized graft; however, there still remain significant advantages with the nonvascularized graft. There has not been a study comparing the quality of life associated with these two methods of mandibular reconstruction. We carried out the following study to compare quality of life of both grafts in an attempt to help guide therapeutic decisions.\nTwenty-nine patients at the University of California, San Francisco undergoing mandibular resection with subsequent reconstruction with either a vascularized fibular free flap or nonvascularized iliac crest bone graft were identified. Patient quality of life was assessed with a modified version of the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire, version 4.\nEighteen patients responded (10 reconstructed previously with a fibula, 8 with iliac crest reconstructions). Patients with an iliac crest bone graft had significantly better chewing and swallowing scores (P = .04, P = .049 respectively). There was also a trend for better taste (P = .067). When patients with a history of radiation therapy were excluded, differences in chewing and swallowing were not significant (P = .26 and P = .31 respectively), whereas taste was (P = .038).\nThese findings suggest that reconstruction with the iliac crest had benefits in improved function (chewing, swallowing, and taste) rather than esthetics, donor site morbidity, or psychologic discomfort as was anticipated. However, prior radiation, a relatively frequent therapy in this patient population, presents an important confounding factor. Radiation therapy is difficult to control for without limiting an already scarce patient pool, and bears with it significant morbidity that likely influenced these findings. Further study is warranted to confirm the results and further distinguish the 2 groups.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2008-08-23", "authors": ["David DVu", "Brian LSchmidt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2008.04.021"}
{"title": "Disruption of the thrombospondin-2 gene alters the lamellar morphology but does not permit vascularization of the adult mouse lumbar disc.", "abstract": "The biological basis for the avascular state of the intervertebral disc is not well understood. Previous work has suggested that the presence of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matricellular protein, in the outer annulus reflects a role for this protein in conferring an avascular status to the disc. In the present study we have examined thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2), a matricellular protein with recognized anti-angiogenic activity in vivo and in vitro.\nWe examined both the location and expression of TSP-2 in the human disc, and its location in the disc and bordering soft tissues of 5-month-old normal wild-type (WT) mice and of mice with a targeted disruption of the TSP-2 gene. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative histology were utilized in this study.\nTSP-2 was found to be present in some, but not all, annulus cells of the human annulus and the mouse annulus. Although there was no difference in the number of disc cells in the annulus of TSP-2-null mice compared with that of WT animals, polarized light microscopy revealed a more irregular lamellar collagen structure in null mouse discs compared with WT mouse discs. Additionally, vascular beds at the margins of discs of TSP-2-null mice were substantially more irregular than those of WT animals. Counts of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive blood vessels in the tissue margin bordering the ventral annulus showed a significantly larger vascular bed in the tissue bordering the disc of TSP-2-null mice compared with that of WT mice (P = 0.0002). There was, however, no vascular ingrowth into discs of the TSP-2-null mice.\nThese data confirm a role for TSP-2 in the morphology of the disc and suggest the presence of other inhibitors of angiogenesis in the disc. We have shown that although an increase in vasculature was present in the TSP-2-null tissue in the margin of the disc, vascular ingrowth into the body of the disc did not occur.

Obtustatin, a snake venom KTS-disintegrin, was applied as a specific inhibitor of this integrin. This low molecular weight peptide revealed a potent therapeutic effect on melanoma progression in 2 animal systems, mouse and quail. Its oncostatic effect was related to the inhibition of angiogenesis. Obtustatin inhibited the neovascularization ratio on the CAM embryo of quail, which was pathologically induced by the developing tumor. The i.v. administration of obtustatin completely blocked cancer growth of MV3 human melanoma in nude mice. In B16F10 syngeneic mouse model treatment with the disintegrin revealed a lower effect, although the development of the tumor was significantly reduced for both dosages. The mechanism of obtustatin action is related to the blocking of microvascular endothelial cell proliferation, which undergoes apoptosis in caspase-dependent manner.

{"title": "Allopurinol attenuates L-NAME induced cardiomyopathy comparable to blockade of angiotensin receptor.", "abstract": "It is widely recognized that L-NAME exposed rats develop myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of xanthine oxidase (XO) to these phenomena using allopurinol, isolated or associated with olmesartan. Thirty adult male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups (n=6) and studied for 5 weeks: L group (L-NAME, 40mg/kg/day); L+A group (L-NAME and allopurinol, 40 mg/kg/day); L+O group (L-NAME and olmesartan, 15mg/kg/day); L+A+O group (L-NAME, allopurinol, and olmesartan); and control group. L-NAME caused arterial hypertension and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Hypertension was prevented by olmesartan, but not by allopurinol. There was an increase of left ventricular mass index in the L-NAME group that was prevented by allopurinol, olmesartan and by the combination of both. The increase in mean cardiomyocyte transversal area caused by L-NAME was prevented by the allopurinol and olmesartan combination, or by olmesartan used as monotherapy, but not by allopurinol alone. There was a reduction in the myocardial vascularization index caused by L-NAME which was abolished by allopurinol or by olmesartan, but not by the association. L-NAME caused a reduction in the total number of cardiomyocyte nuclei. This was prevented by olmesartan alone or associated with allopurinol, but not by allopurinol alone. We conclude that XO has an important contribution to adverse cardiac remodeling in L-NAME exposed animals. Moreover, allopurinol acts without interfering with L-NAME induced hypertension. The protective action of this drug is comparable to the results obtained with olmesartan.

{"title": "Differential vascularization of nematode-induced feeding sites.", "abstract": "Sedentary nematodes are destructive plant pathogens that cause significant yield losses. In the roots of their host plants, cyst nematodes (CNs) and root-knot nematodes (RKNs) induce different, highly specialized feeding sites--syncytia or giant cells (GCs), respectively--to optimize nutrient uptake. We compared the mechanisms by which nutrients are delivered from the model host plant, Arabidopsis, to GCs induced by the RKN Meloidogyne incognita or to syncytia induced by the CN Heterodera schachtii. From previous work, syncytia were known to be symplastically connected to newly formed host phloem composed of sieve elements (SEs) and companion cells. Here we studied the formation of plasmodesmata (PD) during GC and syncytia development by monitoring a viral movement protein that targets branched PD and the development of host phloem during GC formation by applying confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Analyses of plants expressing soluble or membrane-anchored green fluorescent protein in their phloem demonstrated symplastic isolation of GCs. GCs were found to be embedded in a tissue that consists exclusively of SEs. These de novo-formed SEs, contained nuclei and were interconnected by secondary PD. A similar interconnection of SEs was observed around syncytia. However, these secondary PD were also present at the SE-syncytium interface, demonstrating the postulated symplastic connection.

{"title": "Apelin/APJ signaling system: a potential link between adipose tissue and endothelial angiogenic processes.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that produces a variety of secretory factors involved in the initiation of angiogenic processes. The bioactive peptide apelin is the endogenous ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor, APJ. Here we investigated the potential role of apelin and its receptor, APJ, in the angiogenic responses of human endothelial cells and the development of a functional vascular network in a model of adipose tissue development in mice. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with apelin dose-dependently increased angiogenic responses, including endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and Matrigel(R) capillary tubelike structure formation. These endothelial effects of apelin were due to activation of APJ, because siRNA directed against APJ, which led to long-lasting down-regulation of APJ mRNA, abolished cell migration induced by apelin in contrast to control nonsilencing siRNA. Hypoxia up-regulated the expression of apelin in 3T3F442A adipocytes, and we therefore determined whether apelin could play a role in adipose tissue angiogenesis in vivo. Epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) transplantation was performed as a model of adipose tissue angiogenesis. Transplantation led to increased apelin mRNA levels 2 and 5 days after transplantation associated with tissue hypoxia, as evidenced by hydroxyprobe staining on tissue sections. Graft revascularization evolved in parallel, as the first functional vessels in EWAT grafts were observed 2 days after transplantation and a strong angiogenic response was apparent on day 14. This was confirmed by determination of graft hemoglobin levels, which are indicative of functional vascularization and were strongly increased 5 and 14 days after transplantation. The role of apelin in the graft neovascularization was then assessed by local delivery of stable complex apelin-targeting siRNA leading to dramatically reduced apelin mRNA levels and vascularization (quantified by hemogloblin content) in grafted EWAT on day 5 when compared with control siRNA. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that apelin/APJ signaling pathways play a critical role in the development of the functional vascular network in adipose tissue. In addition, we have shown that adipocyte-derived apelin can be up-regulated by hypoxia.

As a promising approach for bone regeneration, tissue engineered bone has become a technically feasible method to repair small to moderate sized bone defects in clinical practice, but it is difficult to repair large one, particularly when the recipient site is scarred by infection or radiation injury. Construction of large and vascularized tissue engineered bone may overcome the problems since vascularization is an essential prerequisite for the constructs to survive and integrate with existing host tissue. On the other hand, prefabrication large artificial bone in vivo bioreactor and axial vascularization by means of arteriovenous loop model in soft tissue have been proved to be feasible. Therefore, we hypothesize that combination of cells, solid scaffold, growth factors, and arteriovenous loop may eventually generate a large and vascularized tissue engineered bone flap in vivo bioreactor.

Over the last 20 years, progress in diagnosis in skeletal oncology and in adjuvant therapy has increased the possibility of applying limb-saving procedures in the treatment of bone sarcoma. In this context, VFT appeared to be a valuable reconstructive tool following the wide segmental resection of the long bones of the limbs. The vascularized fibula allows for fast bone fusion. It also demonstrates a tendency of progressive hypertrophy and, in those instances in which it is associated with an avascular massive bone allograft (MBA), it induces a process of osteo-integration which enhances the biomechanical properties of a combined graft. In order to assess the progression of the morphologic and structural changes of combined bone grafts we reviewed a group of 31 bone sarcoma patients who had had tibia reconstruction with a VFT inlaid in a massive allograft. Patients had been operated on between 1994 and 2006. Ages ranged from 4 to 31 years (mean 14 years). Thirty patients had received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

To date, most of the cardiac effects of cell-based therapy are believed to be mediated by a local angiogenic response rather than by the formation of neosyncytial contractile units such as had initially been hoped for. Therefore, repopulation of the ischemic or infarcted heart with progenitor cells that have vasculogenic potential may be an important mechanism to improve contractile function, both in the presence of viable and nonviable myocardium. This constitutes a focus within scientific reach; however, the low engraftment and viability of progenitor cells after transplantation necessitate the exploration of novel delivery techniques.

Strategies that include seeding endothelial cells (ECs) on biomaterials and promoting their adhesion, migration and functionality might be a solution for the formation of vascularized bone.

In this work we addressed the influence of this nano-network on growth pattern, morphology, inflammatory expression profile, expression of structural proteins, homotypic interactions and angiogenic potential of human EC cultured on a scaffold made of a blend of starch and poly(caprolactone). The nano-network allowed cells to span between individual micro-fibers and influenced cell morphology. Furthermore, on nano-fibers as well as on micro-fibers ECs maintained the physiological expression pattern of the structural protein vimentin and PECAM-1 between adjacent cells. In addition, ECs growing on the nano/micro-fiber-combined scaffold were sensitive to pro-inflammatory stimulus. Under pro-angiogenic conditions in vitro, the ECM-like nano-network provided the structural and organizational stability for ECs' migration and organization into capillary-like structures.

The complications associated with these grafts include harvest site morbidity and graft incorporation. Using a vascularized local soft tissue source could minimize complications of graft reconstructions.

All animals received either nicotine (3 mg/kg) or saline 4 weeks before the surgical procedure and continued to receive nicotine from surgery to sacrifice at 7, 14, or 28 days. The autogenous bone block graft was harvested from the calvaria and stabilized on the external cortical area near the angle of the mandible.\nThe histologic analyses of the nicotine group depicted a delay in osteogenic activity at the bed-graft interface, as well as impairment of the organization of the granulation tissue that developed instead of blood clot. Nicotine-group specimens exhibited less bone neoformation, and the newly formed bone was poorly cellularized and vascularized. The histometric analysis revealed significantly less bone formation in the nicotine group at both 14 days (23.75% +/- 6.18% versus 51.31% +/- 8.31%) and 28 days (42.44% +/- 8.70% versus 73.00% +/- 4.99%).\nNicotine did jeopardize the early healing process of autogenous bone block grafts in rats but did not prevent it.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2008-08-15", "authors": ["SamaraBonfante", "Alvaro FranciscoBosco", "Danielle ShimaLuize", "Juliano Milanezide Almeida", "Tania MaryCestari", "RumioTaga"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinase 13 is induced in fibroblasts in polyomavirus middle T antigen-driven mammary carcinoma without influencing tumor progression.", "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 13 (collagenase 3) is an extracellular matrix remodeling enzyme that is induced in myofibroblasts during the earliest invasive stages of human breast carcinoma, suggesting that it is involved in tumor progression. During progression of mammary carcinomas in the polyoma virus middle T oncogene mouse model (MMTV-PyMT), Mmp13 mRNA was strongly upregulated concurrently with the transition to invasive and metastatic carcinomas. As in human tumors, Mmp13 mRNA was found in myofibroblasts of invasive grade II and III carcinomas, but not in benign grade I and II mammary intraepithelial neoplasias. To determine if MMP13 plays a role in tumor progression, we crossed MMTV-PyMT mice with Mmp13 deficient mice. The absence of MMP13 did not influence tumor growth, vascularization, progression to more advanced tumor stages, or metastasis to the lungs, and the absence of MMP13 was not compensated for by expression of other MMPs or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. However, an increased fraction of thin collagen fibrils was identified in MMTV-PyMT;Mmp13(-/-) compared to MMTV-PyMT;Mmp13(+/+) tumors, showing that collagen metabolism was altered in the absence of MMP13. We conclude that the expression pattern of Mmp13 mRNA in myofibroblasts of invasive carcinomas in the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model recapitulates the expression pattern observed in human breast cancer. Our results suggest that MMP13 is a marker of carcinoma-associated myofibroblasts of invasive carcinoma, even though it does not make a major contribution to tumor progression in the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2008-08-14", "authors": ["Boye SNielsen", "MikalaEgeblad", "FritzRank", "Hanne AAskautrud", "Caroline JPennington", "Tanja XPedersen", "Ib JChristensen", "Dylan REdwards", "ZenaWerb", "Leif RLund"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0002959"}

Inducible near infra-red (NIR) fluorescent probes were utilized to visualize intestinal polyps of mice hemizygous for a novel truncation of the Adenomatous Polyposis coli (APC) gene. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy in live mice allowed visualization of cathepsin activity in richly vascularized benign dysplastic lesions. Using biotinylated suicide inhibitors we quantified increased activities of the Cathepsin B & Z in the polyps. More than (3/4) of the probe signal was localized in CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages infiltrating the lesions. Polyposis was attenuated through genetic ablation of cathepsin B, and suppressed by neutralization of TNFalpha in mice. In both cases, diminished probe signal was accounted for by loss of MDSC.

{"title": "Angiogenesis in osteoarthritis.", "abstract": "Much has been documented in recent years on the possible involvement of angiogenesis in osteoarthritis. An understanding of the various regulatory mechanisms controlling blood vessel growth in the joint should lead to novel therapeutics, which selectively inhibit undesirable angiogenesis. Here, we summarize recent findings on the roles of angiogenesis in osteoarthritis and place this evidence in the context of previous literature in order to help explain pain and disease progression.\nInflammation and angiogenesis are closely associated in osteoarthritis, modulating functions of chondrocytes, contributing towards abnormal tissue growth and perfusion, ossification and endochondral bone development, leading to radiographic changes observed in the joint. Innervation accompanies vascularization and inflammation, hypoxia and mechanical overload are all thought to contribute in sensitizing these new nerves leading to increased pain. Articular cartilage provides a unique environment in which blood vessel growth is regulated by endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors and matrix constituents, as well as by growth factors produced by chondrocytes, subchondral bone and synovium. MRI and ultrasound enable the in-vivo visualization of abnormal vascularity in synovium and subchondral bone that have not been apparent with conventional radiography. As a result of these new findings, the widely accepted notion that osteoarthritis is primarily a disease of the cartilage is being challenged.\nMolecular mechanisms and consequences of angiogenesis in osteoarthritis are slowly being elucidated. Studies, both in humans and animal models, support the notion that inhibiting angiogenesis will provide effective therapeutic strategies for treating osteoarthritis. Better techniques that can more precisely visualize the vascular changes of the whole joint can further enhance our understanding of osteoarthritis, and can provide proof of concept and early evidence of efficacy in trials of novel therapeutic interventions.", "journal": "Current opinion in rheumatology", "date": "2008-08-14", "authors": ["SadafAshraf", "David AndrewWalsh"], "doi": "10.1097/BOR.0b013e3283103d12"}

The reasons for the beneficial clinical effects of eccentric training are not known. Vascularization followed by regression of the vasculature enhances the healing response of injured tendons. Eccentric exercise induces a more beneficial healing response than concentric exercise.\nSixty rats with patellar tendon injuries were divided into three groups: nonexercise controls (group N; n = 20); concentric exercise group (group C; n = 20); eccentric exercise group (group E; n = 20). Each rat was taught to run uphill or downhill for 14 days. Patellar tendons were removed 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days following injury. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1, and angiopoietin-2 were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nIn group C, VEGF mRNA was increased 1 and 4 days following injury but was decreased on days 7, 10, and 14. In group E, VEGF mRNA was elevated only on day 1. In group N, VEGF mRNA remained at a low level throughout all 14 days. The angiopoietin-2/angiopoietin-1 ratio was higher for group C than for group E.\nIn the presence of VEGF, angiopoietin-1 promotes vessel stability, whereas angiopoietin-2 has the opposite effect. Eccentric exercise contributes to stabilized angiogenesis during the early phase of tendon injury. Conversely, concentric exercise, which induces destabilized angiogenesis, leads to a delayed healing response.

This condition can be achieved in a co-culture model of HUVEC and primary human osteoblasts (hOB) employing polyurethane scaffolds and platelet-rich plasma in a static microenvironment. We clearly show that hOB support cell proliferation and spontaneous formation of multiple tube-like structures by HUVEC that were positive for the endothelial cell markers CD31 and vWF. In contrast, in a monoculture, most HUVEC neither proliferated nor formed any apparent vessel-like structures. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR analyses of gene expression revealed that cell differentiation of hOB and HUVEC was stable in long-term co-culture.

We isolated from rat bone marrow a subset of multipotent adult progenitor cell-derived progenitor cells (MDPC). In vitro, MDPCs secreted multiple cytokines related to inflammation and angiogenesis, including monocyte chemotactic protein-1, SDF-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, and VEGF, and expressed the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and VEGFR1. To investigate in vivo properties, we transplanted MDPCs into the ischemic hind limbs of rats. Elevated levels of the chemokine SDF-1 and colocalization of CD11b(+) cells marked the initial phase of tissue remodeling after cell transplantation. Prolonged engraftment was observed in the adventitial-medial border region of arterioles of ischemic muscles. However, engrafted cells did not differentiate into endothelial or smooth muscle cells. Limb perfusion normalized 4 weeks after cell injection. Inhibition of SDF-1 reduced the engraftment of transplanted cells and decreased endothelial cell proliferation. These findings suggest a two-stage model whereby transplanted MDPCs modulate wound repair through recruitment of inflammatory cells to ischemic tissue.

To study the role of IGF-1 in mammary tumorigenesis in vivo, we used transgenic mice in which overexpression of IGF-1 is under the control of the bovine keratin 5 (BK5) promoter and is directed to either the myoepithelial or basal cells in a variety of organs, including the mammary gland. This model closely recapitulates the paracrine exposure of breast epithelium to stromal IGF-1 seen in women. Histologically, mammary glands from transgenic mice were hyperplastic and highly vascularized. Mammary glands from prepubertal transgenic mice had significantly increased ductal proliferation compared with wild-type tissues, although this difference was not maintained after puberty.

With the exception of the full-length Jagged1 transfectant, all other cell lines, including the control, generated tumors when injected subcutaneously in athymic mice. Suppression of Notch signaling by the soluble ligands significantly increased tumor onset and growth, whereas full-length Jagged1 completely suppressed tumor development. In addition, there were striking differences in tumor pathology with respect to growth kinetics, vascularization, collagen content, size and number of necrotic foci, and invasiveness into the underlying tissue. Further, the production of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, also differed among the tumor types. Lastly, both Jagged1- and Delta1-derived tumors contained phenotypically distinct populations of lipid-filled cells that corresponded with increased expression of adipocyte markers.

Proprietary software can be used to calculate three indices of vascularity: vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). Although these indices appear to have a predictive value in the clinical setting and can be shown to vary between different patient populations and over time within the same population, their relationship with true in-vivo blood flow characteristics has not been established. The objective was to examine the effect of flow rate, vessel number, attenuation and erythrocyte density on these indices.\nA computer-driven flow phantom was used to continuously pump a nylon particle-based blood mimic (Orgasol(trade mark)) around a closed system through three different ultrasound test tanks. These tanks were designed specifically for these experiments and contained C-Flex(trade mark) tubing, in a variety of arrangements, encased in an agar-based tissue mimic. The test tanks were insonated with a modified 3D transvaginal 4-8-MHz ultrasound transducer and 3D power Doppler data were then acquired over a graduated series of flow rates, depths and blood mimic concentrations. Regression analysis was used to determine the resulting relationships.\nThe VI increased linearly with an increase in flow rate (P < 0.05), whereas the FI increased in a cubic manner with a more rapid initial increase (P < 0.05). The VI demonstrated a similar linear increase with an increase in the erythrocyte mimic density (P < 0.05), whereas the FI increased markedly with a small change in erythrocyte mimic density and then plateaued (P < 0.01). There was a significant reduction in each index as the distance between the transducer and vessel increased (P < 0.05). Patterns similar to those seen in relation to the change in flow rate were evident, with a more linear relationship between depth and the VI and VFI than between depth and the FI, although the FI remained relatively constant and was not significantly affected by distance from the transducer until a depth of 55 mm was reached. Although a positive linear relationship was seen between vessel number and VI and VFI (P < 0.05) the FI demonstrated a very different and complex, cubic relationship (P < 0.001), increasing linearly until a maximum of three vessels were present when it decreased, and no overall correlation was seen (P > 0.05).\nThe VI, FI and VFI are all significantly affected by volume flow, attenuation, vessel number and erythrocyte density, but in different ways. The VI and VFI seem to have a more predictable relationship, whereas the FI often demonstrates a more complex cubic relationship that is not always logical.

Within the framework of the endocranial morphogenesis and evolution, understanding the role and variation of the middle meningeal artery relies upon the very limited, scattered, and descriptive information available. The meninges are supplied by branches originating from both the internal and external carotid arteries, often converging in the same networks and hence raising questions on the homology and embryogenesis of these vessels. The middle meningeal artery is often ligated during craniotomies, with no apparent impairment of the cerebral functional processes. The exact physiological role of this extended vascular system, together with the adaptations and selective pressure associated with its evolutionary characterization, have generally been ignored.\nAnthropologists have made many attempts to quantify and qualify the differences and variation between and within human and nonhuman primates, with scarce results due to the blurry morphology of the vascular networks. Living apes and humans probably have meningeal vessels originating from different embryogenetic processes, further hampering easy phylogenetic comparisons. Generally, monkeys and apes display a larger component derived from the internal carotid artery and its ophthalmic branch.\nThe fossil endocasts partially show the traces of the middle meningeal vessels, allowing some hypotheses on the evolution of these structures. In contrast with modern humans, some extinct groups show a dominance of the posterior branch over the anterior one. The most interesting features are associated with the variation of the middle branch, which supplies the parietal areas. In any case, the most striking difference between the modern and non-modern humans regard the definite increase in the number and complexity of the anastomoses and reticulation in the former. This may be either the simple result of a larger percentage of traces left by the soft tissue or be associated with a more developed vascular network.\nTools are needed to quantify and qualify the morphogenesis and variations of the middle meningeal artery. Supposing these vessels are not strictly necessary in the adult age, the evolutionary pressure shaping their structure may have been associated with early life stages.

Neonatal cardiac myocytes were isolated from 2-day-old Fischer 344 rat hearts. Silicone chambers containing fibrin gel were seeded with varying numbers of cardiac cells (1, 5, 10, and 20 million). Control chambers were prepared using fibrin gel alone. All of the chambers were then implanted around the femoral vessels of isogenic rats. Six constructs per cell seeding density group were implanted. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was performed via hematoxylin and eosin, von Gieson, and alpha-sarcomeric actin staining protocols. Linear contractile force measurements were obtained for each construct following 4 weeks of in vivo implantation. After an implantation period of 4 weeks, the newly formed cardiac constructs contained within the chambers were harvested. The femoral vessels within the constructs were found to be patent in all cases. With direct electrical stimulation, the constructs were able to generate an average active force that varied depending on their seeding density. Constructs with seeding densities of 1, 5, 10, and 20 million cells produced an average active force of 208, 241, 151, and 108 microN, respectively. The control constructs did not generate any active force on electrical stimulation. This study demonstrates the in vivo survival, vascularization, organization, and function of transplanted myocardial cells. It is also apparent that cell seeding density plays a direct role in the force generation and mechanical properties of these engineered constructs. Among different groups using varying cell seeding densities, we found that the group with 5 million cells generated maximum active force.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2008-08-08", "authors": ["RaviBirla", "VikasDhawan", "Yen-ChihHuang", "IanLytle", "KhajohnTiranathanagul", "DavidBrown"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1525-1594.2008.00591.x"}

The influence of the differentiation of myogenic graft for functional recovery is not defined. We engineered a biodegradable skeletal muscle graft (ESMG) tissue and investigated its functional effect after implantation on the epicardium of an infarcted heart segment. ESMGs were synthesized by mixing collagen (2 mg/mL), Matrigel (2 mg/mL), and rat skeletal muscle cells (10(6)). Qualitative and quantitative aspects of ESMGs were optimized. Two weeks following coronary ligation, the animals were randomized in three groups: ESMG glued to the epicardial surface with fibrin (ESMG, n = 7), fibrin alone (fibrin, n = 5), or sham operation (sham, n = 4). Echocardiography, histology, and immunostaining were performed 4 weeks later. A cohesive three-dimensional tissular structure formed in vitro within 1 week. Myoblasts differentiated into randomly oriented myotubes. Four weeks postimplantation, ESMGs were vascularized and invaded by granulation tissue. Mean fractional shortening (FS) was, however, significantly increased in the ESMG group as compared with preimplantation values (42 +/- 6 vs. 33 +/- 5%, P < 0.05) and reached the values of controlled noninfarcted animals (control, n = 5; 45 +/- 3%; not significant). Pre- and postimplantation FS did not change over these 4 weeks in the sham group and the fibrin-treated animals.

The degree of tumor vascularization in prostate cancer correlates with disease progression and, thus, markers of angiogenesis are potential indicators of clinical outcome. Identification of improved prognostic markers would have a substantial effect on patient outcomes. Such markers would also be invaluable in assessments of the effectiveness of experimental chemotherapeutic regimens and antiangiogenic drugs that are currently under investigation. Bone-marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) play an integral part in neovascularization and their levels in the circulation correlate with disease progression and therapeutic response in various settings. Although CECs and CEPs are yet to be thoroughly investigated in prostate cancer, the evidence suggests that these markers may be of use in the prostate-cancer setting.

Quantitative assessment included the following 3D Doppler parameters: vascularization index, flow intensity, and vascularization flow index. On the same day, concentrations of oestradiol (serum only), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and leptin were determined in the serum and in the follicular fluid. All 3D-PDS indices were significantly higher with contrast enhancement (P < 0.05). Follicular fluid concentrations of VEGF and IGFBP-3, as well as serum concentrations of leptin, showed significant P-values when correlated with (sub)endometrial Doppler indices. A weak linear dependency appeared between flow intensity and VEGF and leptin. Furthermore, weak dependencies were apparent between 3D Doppler parameters and high follicular fluid concentrations of VEGF and IGFBP-3.

{"title": "Induction of angiogenesis in tissue-engineered scaffolds designed for bone repair: a combined gene therapy-cell transplantation approach.", "abstract": "One of the fundamental principles underlying tissue engineering approaches is that newly formed tissue must maintain sufficient vascularization to support its growth. Efforts to induce vascular growth into tissue-engineered scaffolds have recently been dedicated to developing novel strategies to deliver specific biological factors that direct the recruitment of endothelial cell (EC) progenitors and their differentiation. The challenge, however, lies in orchestration of the cells, appropriate biological factors, and optimal factor doses. This study reports an approach as a step forward to resolving this dilemma by combining an ex vivo gene transfer strategy and EC transplantation. The utility of this approach was evaluated by using 3D poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLAGA) sintered microsphere scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. Our goal was achieved by isolation and transfection of adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) with adenovirus encoding the cDNA of VEGF. We demonstrated that the combination of VEGF releasing ADSCs and ECs results in marked vascular growth within PLAGA scaffolds.

However, there is tremendous impact on patients due to the surgical invasiveness. Endovascular aortic repair using stent graft was introduced in 1991. After refinement of the techniques and technology, endovascular aortic repair was approved by most health authorities and is associated with less periprocedural morbidities. In between these two extremes, some surgeons endeavored to create an alternative and perform less invasive surgeries. Hand-assisted laparoscopic aortic surgery and laparoscopic-assisted aortic surgery were introduced in 1996. In 2001, total laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm resection with tube graft interposition was first performed in Canada. Till now, only a few vascular units in North America and Europe perform these delicate techniques. We report our first case of total laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

{"title": "FERM control of FAK function: implications for cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Integrins are transmembrane receptors that bind to extracellular matrix proteins and convey anchorage-dependent signals regulating normal cell proliferation. Integrin signals within the tumor micro-environment also impact cancer cell survival and invasion during tumor progression. These integrin-associated signaling events are transduced in part through the activation of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is activated by beta-subunit integrins in both normal and transformed cells. As genetic inactivation of beta1 integrin or FAK yield early embryonic lethal phenotypes associated with decreased cell proliferation, and dominant-negative inhibition of FAK can cause increased cell apoptosis, there is a concern that FAK inhibition may have cytotoxic effects on cell growth or survival. However, FAK-specific small molecule inhibitors do not directly impact cell growth in culture, but yet show potent anti-tumor growth effects in vivo. Additionally, recent studies have shed new insight into the FAK kinase-independent regulation of cell proliferation and survival mediated by the FAK N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domain. Herein, we review the role of the FAK FERM domain in both the intrinsic regulation of FAK kinase activity and how FERM-mediated nuclear localization of FAK promotes enhanced cell survival through the inhibition of tumor suppressor p53 activation during development and under conditions of cellular stress. As we find that FAK FERM-mediated regulation of p53 occurs in human carcinoma cells, elevated FAK expression in tumors may promote both kinase-dependent and -independent survival mechanisms. We discuss how the pharmacological inhibition of FAK kinase activity may impact tumor progression through combined effects of blocking both tumor- and stromal-associated signaling regulating neo-vascularization.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2008-08-05", "authors": ["Ssang-TaekLim", "DavidMikolon", "Dwayne GStupack", "David DSchlaepfer"], "doi": "10.4161/cc.6367"}
{"title": "Loss of integrin alpha1beta1 ameliorates Kras-induced lung cancer.", "abstract": "The collagen IV binding receptor integrin alpha1beta1 has been shown to regulate lung cancer due to its proangiogenic properties; however, it is unclear whether this receptor also plays a direct role in promoting primary lung tumors. To investigate this possibility, integrin alpha1-null mice were crossed with KrasLA2 mice that carry an oncogenic mutation of the Kras gene (G12D) and develop spontaneous primary tumors with features of non-small cell lung cancer. We provide evidence that KrasLA2/alpha1-null mice have a decreased incidence of primary lung tumors and longer survival compared with KrasLA2/alpha1 wild-type controls. Tumors from KrasLA2/alpha1-null mice were also smaller, less vascularized, and exhibited reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end staining, respectively. Moreover, tumors from the KrasLA2/alpha1-null mice showed diminished extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but enhanced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Primary lung tumor epithelial cells isolated from KrasLA2/alpha1-null mice showed a significant decrease in anchorage-independent colony formation, collagen-mediated cell proliferation, ERK activation, and, most importantly, tumorigenicity when injected into nude mice compared with KrasLA2/alpha1 wild-type tumor cells. These results indicate that loss of the integrin alpha1 subunit decreases the incidence and growth of lung epithelial tumors initiated by oncogenic Kras, suggesting that both Kras and integrin alpha1beta1 cooperate to drive the growth of non-small cell lung cancer in vivo.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2008-08-05", "authors": ["InesMacias-Perez", "CorinaBorza", "XiwuChen", "XuexianYan", "RaquelIbanez", "GlendaMernaugh", "Lynn MMatrisian", "RoyZent", "AmbraPozzi"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1395"}

Four groups of scaffolds were generated with VEGF (12 microg), BMP-2 (2 mug), both VEGF (12 microg) and BMP-2 (2 microg), or no growth factor released from gelatin microparticles incorporated within the scaffold pores. These scaffolds were implanted within an 8 mm rat cranial critical size defect (n=8-9 for each group). At 4 and 12 weeks, implants were retrieved and evaluated by microcomputed tomography (microCT) and histological scoring analysis. Additionally, 4 week animals were perfused with a radiopaque material to visualize and quantify blood vessel formation. Histological analysis revealed that for all groups at 4 weeks, a majority of the porous scaffold volume was filled with vascularized fibrous tissue; however, bone formation appeared most abundant in the dual release group at this time. At 12 weeks, both dual release and BMP-2 groups showed large amounts of bone formation within the scaffold pores and along the outer surfaces of the scaffold; osteoid secretion and mineralization were apparent, and new bone was often in close or direct contact with the scaffold interface. MicroCT results showed no significant difference among groups for blood vessel formation at 4 weeks (<4% blood vessel volume); however, the dual release group showed significantly higher bone formation (16.1+/-9.2% bone volume) than other groups at this time. At 12 weeks, dual release and BMP-2 groups exhibited significantly higher bone formation (39.7+/-14.1% and 37.4+/-18.8% bone volume, respectively) than either the VEGF group or blank scaffolds (6.3+/-4.8% and 7.8+/-7.1% bone volume, respectively). This work indicates a synergistic effect of the dual delivery of VEGF and BMP-2 on bone formation at 4 weeks and suggests an interplay between these growth factors for early bone regeneration. For the doses investigated, the results show that the addition of VEGF does not affect the amount of bone formation achieved by BMP-2 at 12 weeks; however, they also indicate that delivery of both growth factors may enhance bone bridging and union of the critical size defect compared to delivery of BMP-2 alone.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2008-08-05", "authors": ["Zarana SPatel", "SimonYoung", "YasuhikoTabata", "John AJansen", "Mark E KWong", "Antonios GMikos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2008.06.019"}

Recently, a novel approach to limb salvage has been described by Capanna and colleagues whereby a massive bone allograft and intramedullary vascularized fibula are combined to reconstruct large, segmental bone defects. This produces a structurally competent reconstruction with enhanced vascular and osteogenic capabilities and the potential to achieve lower rates of infection, fracture, and nonunion.

{"title": "Vascularized bone grafts and their applications in the treatment of carpal pathology.", "abstract": "Vascularized bone grafts (VBGs) are techniques in the management of certain types of carpal pathology. VBGs have traditionally been advocated for conditions including delayed and nonunion of fractures and avascular necrosis. The most common indications for VBG have been for scaphoid nonunion, lunatomalacia (Kienb\u00f6ck's disease), and osteonecrosis of the scaphoid (Preiser's disease). Advantages over NVBG have been established. VBGs provide improved blood flow, osteocyte preservation, and accelerated healing rates. Local pedicled VBGs are the most commonly used methods. They are technically less demanding than are free VBGs and are associated with less morbidity. Commonly used donor grafts arise from the dorsal vasculature of the wrist and include the 1,2 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery (1,2 ICSRA), the 2,3 ICSRA, the fourth extensor compartment artery (fourth ECA), and the fifth ECA. A 4 + 5 ECA combination graft has been described to provide a longer pedicle. In managing osteonecrosis, most surgeons would agree that VBG should be reserved for carpal bones with an intact cartilaginous shell and no collapse.

{"title": "Vascularized metatarsophalangeal joint transfer for radial hypoplasia.", "abstract": "The relatively new concept and technique of microvascular joint transplantation for the correction of the congenitally deformed wrist is presented with a series of 24 operated radial club hands. The results from the 19 upper extremities with a mean follow-up of 11 years show that the new technique will not diminish the longitudinal growth of the ulna. The ulna length in the series is now 15.4 cm in mean and will develop further and presumably better than that reported in the previous long-term studies after centralization. The superiority in wrist active mobility compared with those of some previous long-term studies is reported with total active motion of 83 degrees in mean. The radial deviation deformity has become increased by 12 degrees in mean in the long-term follow-up compared with the results reported previously by the same author in the series of the first nine patients in 1998. The balance in the growth between the supporting metatarsal joint and the distal ulna has remained satisfactory, and the resting radial deviation angle is 28 degrees in mean (range, 0 to 45 degrees) in the cases with successful joint transfer. A subluxation tendency in six of the transplanted joints is a new finding, and its prevention needs careful attention during the reconstruction. With respect to timing, the joint alignment and transplantation procedure is best performed between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years according to the current experience of the author. A pollicization is usually added after the wrist alignment procedure. This technique will give the child a period of ~10 years without any new need for surgical treatment, and usually no splinting is needed during that period. However, an additional corrective osteotomy may be needed at early puberty depending on the growth properties of the joint graft and original ulna and because of ulnar bowing. The reported technique with preoperative and postoperative measures takes a period of about one-half year, and the whole procedure is considered quite demanding as far as an adequate preoperative soft tissue distraction and the microvascular joint transplantation are concerned. It is recommended that the treatment be performed in dedicated microsurgical centers with adequate pediatric tissue transfer experience.", "journal": "Seminars in plastic surgery", "date": "2008-08-01", "authors": ["Simo KVilkki"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2008-1081403"}
{"title": "Vascularized growth plate transfer for distal radius reconstruction.", "abstract": "Distal radius reconstruction in children should meet two requests: restoration of some joint function and preservation of the physiologic growth of the segment. None of the conventional options is likely to successfully achieve both goals. Conversely, a vascularized transfer of the proximal fibula including the growth plate provides enough bone stock for diaphyseal reconstruction, an articular surface for joint function, and the potential for longitudinal growth. From 1992 to 2006, eight children ranging in age between 2 and 10 years underwent a vascularized transfer of the proximal fibula for distal radius reconstruction after bone sarcoma resection. The follow-up ranges were between 1 year and 15 years. All the grafts were harvested based on the anterior tibial artery. Seven cases with a follow-up longer than 2 years have been evaluated both clinically and radiographically. All the grafts survived and had a satisfactory growth after the transplant. The functional outcome has been satisfactory, and the range of motion of the reconstructed wrist has been nearly normal in all cases but one. Proximal fibular epiphyseal transfer was an effective procedure for distal radius reconstruction in children who underwent tumor resection.

However, the use of prosthetic material may lead to granulation, allergic reaction, infection, recurrence of hernia, and thoracic deformity. Tissue engineering may become an alternative treatment strategy for diaphragmatic hernia repair, since the regenerated autologous tissue is expected to grow potentially without rejection or infection. We evaluated the efficacy of diaphragmatic hernia repair in a rat model using a poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) mesh-collagen sponge hybrid scaffold, designed for in situ tissue engineering. Twenty-four F344 female rats were used. Oval-shaped defects were surgically created in the left diaphragm and repaired with three different grafts, including PLGA mesh in group 1 (n = 7), PLGA mesh-collagen sponge hybrid scaffold in group 2 (n = 7), and PLGA mesh-collagen sponge hybrid scaffold seeded with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in group 3 (n = 10).

Allograft is a commonly used technique to reconstruct a large osseous defect following tumor excision in the United States and some European countries, and relatively good results have been reported because of its biologic nature. However, with the use of an allograft, there are concerns of transmission of infectious diseases, immunological reactions, and social or religious refusal in some regions in the world. Under these circumstances, vascularized autogenous fibular or iliac bone grafts are commonly used techniques and bone lengthening techniques using external fixation have been reported recently. These procedures utilize viable bone. In addition to these procedures, some biological reconstructive techniques utilizing nonviable bone have been performed as surgical alternatives for allografts using treated recycling bone including irradiated or pasteurized resected bone graft and reconstruction using an autograft containing tumor treated by liquid nitrogen.

In each animal, the opposite bulla was filled with Bio-Oss, a bone substitute consisting of a portion of mineral bovine bone. Histologic evaluations were performed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 12 weeks after the implantation.\nAfter an initial phase in which the ceramic granules were surrounded by inflammatory cells (1-2 wk), there were increasing signs of vascularization. Osteoneogenesis and-at the same time-resorption of the HA ceramic were observed after the third week. No major difference in comparison to the bovine bone material could be found.\nOur results confirm the favorable qualities of the new ceramic reported in association with current maxillofacial literature. Conventional HA granules used for mastoid obliteration to date often showed problems with prolonged inflammatory reactions and, finally, extrusions. In contrast to those ceramics, the new material seems to induce more osteoneogenesis and undergoes early resorption probably due to its high porosity.

We investigated effects of progesterone (P(4)) and the conceptus on expression and localization of SPP1 in the ovine uterus. Steady-state levels of SPP1 mRNA in the endometrium of unilaterally pregnant ewes did not differ significantly between nongravid and gravid horns within their respective days of pregnancy; however, levels did increase as pregnancy progressed. SPP1 mRNA was detectable in the glandular epithelium (GE) of both nongravid and gravid horns via in situ hybridization. SPP1 protein was localized to the apical surface of the luminal epithelium of both nongravid and gravid uterine horns. Gravid horns exhibited extensive stromal SPP1 on Days 40 through 120, whereas SPP1 was markedly lower in the stroma of nongravid uterine horns through Day 80 of pregnancy. By Day 120, stromal expression of SPP1 between nongravid and gravid horns was similar. Long-term P(4) treatment of ovariectomized ewes induced SPP1 in the uterine stroma and GE. A bioactive 45-kDa SPP1 fragment was purified from uterine secretions and promoted ovine trophectoderm cell attachment in vitro. Interestingly, increased stromal cell expression of SPP1 was positively associated with vascularization as assessed by von Willebrand factor staining. Finally, ovine uterine artery endothelial cells produced SPP1 during outgrowth into three-dimensional collagen matrices in an in vitro model system that recapitulates angiogenesis.

{"title": "Characterization of the structure and permeability of titanium foams for spinal fusion devices.", "abstract": "Titanium foams produced via the space-holder method are used for spinal fusion devices since their combination of an open-cell structure and bone-like mechanical properties promises potentially excellent bone ingrowth. Earlier studies have indicated that the size of the pores and interconnects must be greater than 100microm for effective bone ingrowth and vascularization. Hence, the quantification of the pore and interconnect size is required for efficient scaffold design. In this study, microcomputed tomography (microCT) was used to obtain the three-dimensional (3D) structure of Ti foams with three levels of porosity (51%, 65% and 78%). Novel algorithms were then applied to quantify both the pore and interconnect size of Ti foams as a function of porosity. All foams possessed a modal pore and interconnect size in excess of 300microm, satisfying the requirement of being greater than 100microm. The pore and interconnect size also dominates the flow properties or permeability of open-cell structures. Therefore, the microCT data was also used to generate a mesh for computational fluid dynamics analysis to predict the permeability. The calculated permeability (117-163x10(-12)m(2) depending on direction) for the Ti foams with 65% porosity was first validated against experimental measurements (98-163x10(-12)m(2)) and then compared to prior authors' measurements in healthy cancellous bovine bone (233-465x10(-12)m(2)).

Conventional methods of assessing the in vivo angiogenic response to tissue-engineered constructs tend to rely on a two-dimensional assessment of microvessel density within representative histological sections without elaboration of the true vascular tree. The introduction of microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) has recently allowed investigators to obtain a diverse range of high-resolution, three-dimensional characterization of structures, including renal, coronary, and hepatic vascular networks, as well as bone formation within healing defects.

In vivo functional outcomes were correlated with in vitro profile for each material. Small intestinal submucosa-based implants demonstrated scar tissue formation and contraction, coincident with mesh pleating, and were characterized by immediate and significant cellular and humoral inflammatory responses. Porcine dermal-based grafts demonstrated significant graft pleating, minimal integration, and an absence of cellular repopulation and vascularization. However, a significant cellular immune response surrounded the grafts, coincident with poor initial wound healing strengths. In vivo observations for the three porcine-derived mesh products correlated with individual in vitro profiles, indicating an absence of characteristic biochemical markers and structural integrity.

{"title": "Treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions.", "abstract": "Scaphoid fractures are common but present unique challenges because of the particular geometry of the fractures and the tenuous vascular pattern of the scaphoid. Delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment for acute scaphoid fractures can lead to nonunions and subsequent degenerative wrist arthritis. Improvements in diagnosis, surgical treatment, and implant materials have encouraged a trend toward early internal fixation, even for nondisplaced scaphoid fractures that could potentially be treated nonoperatively. Despite the advent of newly developed fixation techniques, including open and percutaneous fixation, the nonunion rate for scaphoid fractures remains as high as 10% after surgical treatment. Scaphoid nonunions can present with or without avascular necrosis of the proximal pole and may show a humpback deformity on the radiograph. If left untreated, scaphoid nonunions can progress to carpal collapse and degenerative arthritis. Surgical treatment is directed at correcting the deformity with open reduction and internal fixation with bone grafting. Recently, vascularized bone grafts have gained popularity in the treatment of scaphoid nonunions, particularly in cases with avascular necrosis.

Because of very short time of the inspiratory phase duration, as well as expiratory phase, only the rich vascularization of the nasal mucosa and specific organization of the submucosal vessels are not able to assure such effective physiological activity. Therefore the type of airflow during the respiration is essential to understanding the functional possibilities of the nasal mucosa. Most studies have investigated the airflow only in steady-flow conditions, where the laminar flow was observed. Anatomically accurate physical models of real nasal cavities and particle image velocimetry allow evaluation of the entire flow field in the nasal cavity. In these investigations a partially turbulent flow was observed even at low air velocities in most part of the nasal cavity. From a physiological perspective, a turbulent flow would seem sensible, since it enhances contact between air and the mucosal layer.

{"title": "ENMD-1198, a novel tubulin-binding agent reduces HIF-1alpha and STAT3 activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) cells, and inhibits growth and vascularization in vivo.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a highly vascularized tumor entity and the process of angiogenesis is essential for the growth of HCC. Importantly, the pro-angiogenic transcription factors HIF-1alpha and STAT3 have been implicated in HCC progression, thus representing interesting targets for molecular targeted therapy. We hypothesized that therapeutic inhibition of HIF-1alpha could be achieved by using a novel tubulin-binding agent (ENMD-1198). ENMD-1198 is an analog of 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity.\nThe human HCC cell lines HUH-7 and HepG2 were used for experiments. Effects of ENMD-1198 on constitutive and inducible (hypoxia, growth factors) activation of signaling cascades, including HIF-1alpha and STAT3, were investigated by Western blotting. Changes in VEGF expression were determined by real-time PCR. Effects of ENMD-1198 on cancer cell migration and invasion were evaluated in in vitro-assays. The growth-inhibitory effects of ENMD-1198 (200 mg/kg/day) were determined in a subcutaneous tumor model (HUH-7).\nENMD-1198 inhibited the phosphorylation of MAPK/Erk, PI-3K/Akt and FAK. Moreover, activation of HIF-1alpha and STAT3 was dramatically reduced by ENMD-1198, which resulted in lower VEGF mRNA expression (P < 0.05). In addition, tumor cell migratory and invasive properties were significantly inhibited (P < 0.05, for both). In vivo, treatment with ENMD-1198 led to a significant reduction in tumor growth, tumor vascularization, and numbers of proliferating tumor cells (P < 0.05 for all).\nThe novel microtubule destabilizing agent ENMD-1198 is suitable for inhibiting HIF-1alpha and STAT3 in human HCC cells and leads to reduced tumor growth and vascularization in vivo. Hence, inhibition of HIF-1alpha and STAT3 could prove valuable for therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2008-07-25", "authors": ["ChristianMoser", "Sven ALang", "AkiraMori", "ClausHellerbrand", "Hans JSchlitt", "Edward KGeissler", "William EFogler", "OliverStoeltzing"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-8-206\n10.1007/s00535-005-1566-3\n10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.008\n10.1016/j.humpath.2007.03.002\n10.1016/S0046-8177(98)90205-2\n10.1111/j.1440-1746.2007.04997.x\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0484\n10.1136/jcp.2006.036970\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.09.049\n10.1038/sj.onc.1205260\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00077-1\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1393\n10.1182/blood-2002-02-0376\n10.1038/368237a0\n10.1016/S0360-3016(00)00767-7\n10.1007/s004320000233\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1320\n10.1007/s10637-006-9008-5\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0440\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0107\n10.1002/cncr.11528\n10.1111/j.1572-0241.2000.01688.x\n10.1053/jhep.2002.36824\n10.2174/1381612024607063\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0628\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1104\n10.1111/j.1872-034X.2007.00143.x\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1699\n10.1016/S0959-8049(00)00159-3\n10.1080/028418698430278\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00025.x\n10.1016/S0168-8278(03)00503-8\n10.1074/jbc.272.36.22642\n10.1074/jbc.273.29.18019\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208719\n10.1038/nrc1187"}
{"title": "The use of acellular dermal matrix for coverage of exposed joint and extensor mechanism in thermally injured patients with few options.", "abstract": "One of the most devastating complications of deep burn injuries to the hand and finger is the exposure of joint, tendon, and neurovascular structures. The inevitable consequence of such injuries is severe deformity, often requiring joint fusions and digital amputations. Complicating this scenario is the anatomic limitation of few local and reliable soft tissue flaps available for this intricate distal distribution. This is particularly true for the patient who has suffered very large and deep thermal injuries.\nThis series of cases describes the use of thin and meshed acellular dermal matrix to cover the exposed joint, tendon, and neurovascular structures, which resulted from severe thermal injuries. Securing the position of the lateral tendinous bands is a key component of the reconstruction. Composite staged reconstructions with either autologus split thickness skin graft or Integra provided definitive soft tissue coverage. Digits and joints were gently ranged when the overlying skin graft or Integra was adherent.\nOf 26 digits treated in 4 patients, 19 digits demonstrated supple and durable skin coverage with acceptable joint mobility. One digit had to be amputated because of infection. Four digits developed Boutonniere deformity. Three digits underwent joint fusion at proximal interphalangeal joint.\nEarly flap coverage, whenever possible, remains our preferred method of treatment of exposed joint, tendon, and neurovascular structures. When flaps are not feasible and faced with potentially salvageable yet terribly injured hands and fingers with complicated exposure, thin and meshed acellular dermal matrix may provide durable and vascularized soft tissue coverage while minimizing eventual deformities.", "journal": "Eplasty", "date": "2008-07-25", "authors": ["DhavalBhavsar", "MayerTenenhaus"], "doi": null}

It is claimed that the particle aggregation methodology may present several advantages, such as combine simultaneously a high interconnectivity with high mechanical properties that are both critical for an in vivo successful application. In order to evaluate these properties, micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) and Dynamical Mechanical Analysis (DMA) were applied. The herein proposed scaffolds present an interesting morphology as assessed by micro-CT that generally seems to be adequate for the proposed applications. At a mechanical level, DMA has shown that chitosan scaffolds have an elastic behaviour under dynamic compression solicitation, being simultaneously mechanically stable in the wet state and exhibiting a storage modulus of 4.21+/-1.04MPa at 1Hz frequency. Furthermore, chitosan scaffolds were evaluated in vivo using a rat muscle-pockets model for different implantation periods (1, 2 and 12 weeks). The histological and immunohistochemistry results have demonstrated that chitosan scaffolds can provide the required in vivo functionality. In addition, the scaffolds interconnectivity has been shown to be favourable to the connective tissues ingrowth into the scaffolds and to promote the neo-vascularization even in early stages of implantation. It is concluded that the proposed chitosan scaffolds produced by particle aggregation method are suitable alternatives, being simultaneously mechanical stable and in vivo biofunctional that might be used in load-bearing tissue engineering applications, including bone and cartilage regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2008-07-25", "authors": ["Patr\u00edcia BMalafaya", "T\u00edrcia CSantos", "Martijnvan Griensven", "Rui LReis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.023"}

{"title": "Corpus luteum-endometrium-embryo interactions in the dairy cow: underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance.", "abstract": "Conception rates of dairy cows are currently declining at an estimated 1% every year. Approximately, 35% of embryos fail to prevent luteolysis during the first three weeks of gestation. Interactions between the corpus luteum, endometrium and embryo are critical to the successful establishment of pregnancy and inadequacies will result in the mortality of the embryo. For example, as little as a one day delay in the post-ovulatory rise of progesterone has serious consequences for embryo development and survival. Recently, we found that LH support, degree of vascularization and luteal cell steroidogenic capacity were not the major factors responsible for this luteal inadequacy, but are nevertheless essential for luteal development and function. Progesterone acting on its receptor in the endometrium stimulates the production of endometrial secretions on which the free-living embryo is dependent. However, their exact composition and effects of inadequate progesterone remains to be determined. The embryo is recognized through its secretion of interferon tau (IFNT), which suppresses luteolytic pulses of prostaglandin F(2 alpha). In the cow, it is most likely that IFNT inhibits oxytocin receptor up-regulation directly and does not require the prior inhibition of oestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1).

It has been hypothesized that the absence of vasculature in the lesion of the TD growth plates at the ends of the long bones is involved in the etiology of the disease. We evaluated the hypoxia status of normal and thiram-induced TD growth plates by immunostaining the protein adducts after pimonidazole hydrochloride administration. In addition, we evaluated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), the major regulator of the hypoxic response that is essential for chondrogenesis, and that of heat-shock proteins (Hsp) downstream from HIF-1alpha. We demonstrated that, in contrast to the normal growth plates, those afflicted by TD were hypoxic. A major increase in hypoxia was observed in the proliferative, hypertrophic, and calcified zones. In the normal growth plate, HIF-1alpha was expressed in chondrocytes of the articular cartilage and of the maturation zone, whereas in cases of TD, HIF-1alpha was also expressed in chondrocytes below the lesion. The expression level of HIF-1alpha was related to the severity of the disease, but was independent of its cause; the same pattern of expression was observed in growth plates of chicks selected for a high incidence of TD. No differentiation-dependent expression of HIF-1alpha was observed in response to hypoxia, as demonstrated by the use of primary cultures of growth plate chondrocytes. In the normal growth plates, Hsp90 and Hsp70 were localized to the maturation zone. More cells expressed both Hsp in the TD lesion. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the TD growth plate, in contrast to the normal one, is hypoxic, probably because of the lack of vascularization.

{"title": "Connexin-43 upregulation in micrometastases and tumor vasculature and its role in tumor cell attachment to pulmonary endothelium.", "abstract": "The modulation of gap junctional communication between tumor cells and between tumor and vascular endothelial cells during tumorigenesis and metastasis is complex. The notion of a role for loss of gap junctional intercellular communication in tumorigenesis and metastasis has been controversial. While some of the stages of tumorigenesis and metastasis, such as uncontrolled cell division and cellular detachment, would necessitate the loss of intercellular junctions, other stages, such as intravasation, endothelial attachment, and vascularization, likely require increased cell-cell contact. We hypothesized that, in this multi-stage scheme, connexin-43 is centrally involved as a cell adhesion molecule mediating metastatic tumor attachment to the pulmonary endothelium.\nTumor cell attachment to pulmonary vasculature, tumor growth, and connexin-43 expression was studied in metastatic lung tumor sections obtained after tail-vein injection into nude mice of syngeneic breast cancer cell lines, overexpressing wild type connexin-43 or dominant-negatively mutated connexin-43 proteins. High-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis was performed using a connexin-43 monoclonal antibody. Calcein Orange Red AM dye transfer by fluorescence imaging was used to evaluate the gap junction function.\nAdhesion of breast cancer cells to the pulmonary endothelium increased with cancer cells overexpressing connexin-43 and markedly decreased with cells expressing dominant-negative connexin-43. Upregulation of connexin-43 was observed in tumor cell-endothelial cell contact areas in vitro and in vivo, and in areas of intratumor blood vessels and in micrometastatic foci.\nConnexin-43 facilitates metastatic 'homing' by increasing adhesion of cancer cells to the lung endothelial cells. The marked upregulation of connexin-43 in tumor cell-endothelial cell contact areas, whether in preexisting 'homing' vessels or in newly formed tumor vessels, suggests that connexin-43 can serve as a potential marker of micrometastases and tumor vasculature and that it may play a role in the early incorporation of endothelial cells into small tumors as seeds for vasculogenesis.", "journal": "BMC medicine", "date": "2008-07-24", "authors": ["M KhairElzarrad", "AbuHaroon", "KlausWillecke", "RadoslawDobrowolski", "Mark NGillespie", "Abu-BakrAl-Mehdi"], "doi": "10.1186/1741-7015-6-20\n10.1073/pnas.88.23.10701\n10.1023/A:1014787014851\n10.1007/s00232-007-9052-x\n10.1016/j.canlet.2005.03.049\n10.1002/cncr.22894\n10.1172/JCI8257\n10.1007/s00232-007-9048-6\n10.1136/jcp.2005.029272\n10.1186/bcr1042\n10.1155/IJBI/2006/37470\n10.1038/71429\n10.1074/jbc.M609653200\n10.1007/s00232-007-9055-7\n10.1080/15419060500514143\n10.1002/ijc.21025\n10.1016/j.canlet.2006.02.020\n10.1002/pros.20317\n10.1002/jcp.20647\n10.1172/JCI26605\n10.1161/01.RES.0000091259.84556.D5\n10.1038/nm0603-653\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.07.033\n10.1016/j.ceb.2004.07.014\n10.1042/BJ20060175\n10.1093/hmg/ddm329\n10.1055/s-2007-964899\n10.1038/2091248a0\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2005.11.004\n10.1083/jcb.200309112"}

With the exception of a decreased serum progesterone level; the endocrine status showed no sign of ovarian insufficiency (LH 5.6 mIU/ml, FSH 9.0 mIU/ml, estradiol 103.7 pg/ml, progesterone 1.51 ng/ml, testosterone 0.11 ng/ml, DHEA-S 62.3 microg/dl, SHBG 64.39 nmol/l, free androgen index 0.6). During laparoscopy 2 uterine subserous leiomyomata, a right-sighted sactosalpinx, bilateral ovarian cysts, and an extended polypoid, vascularized endometriosis of the bladder peritoneum, the pelvic wall and Douglas pouch were found. Complete pelvic deperitonealization, bilateral adnexectomy, and also enucleation of the 2 leiomyomata were performed.\nPathological examination confirmed the sactosalpinx. In the cystic ovary (right side), a serous cystadenoma close to a hemorrhagic corpus luteum (HCL) was diagnosed. The left ovary showed another HCL. The removed leiomyomata did not show atypia or significant mitotic activity. The endometriotic lesions presented strong expression of the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor, and the proliferation marker MIB-1. In addition, there was no HER-2-neu expression. A switch to the aromatase inhibitor letrozol was recommended.\nThe possibility of tamoxifen-induced or tamoxifen-driven endometriosis in peri- or postmenopausal patients with breast cancer should be considered.", "journal": "Gynecologic and obstetric investigation", "date": "2008-07-23", "authors": ["Andreas DEbert", "GabrieleRosenow", "MatthiasDavid", "SylviaMechsner", "Islam SMagalov", "ThomasPapadopoulos"], "doi": "10.1159/000146085"}
{"title": "Heparin-regulated delivery of osteoprotegerin promotes vascularization of implanted hydrogels.", "abstract": "Localized, controlled delivery of pro-angiogenic agents is an important component of therapies for chronic wound treatment and regenerative medicine. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily member has recently been shown to be pro-angiogenic in vitro, and we hypothesized that controlled delivery of OPG could induce angiogenesis in vivo. OPG contains a highly basic heparin-binding domain, suggesting that affinity interactions could be used to control the rate of its ion-exchange-driven release from drug-delivery devices. Here, we describe the use of a hydrogel consisting of thiol-modified heparin which can be readily and controllably cross-linked using a bi-functional PEG-diacrylate. These hydrogels were found to retain between 750 and 900 ng of immunoreactive OPG for up to 500 h in in vitro release studies. OPG containing hydrogels were evaluated in a subcutaneous mouse implant model, and exhibited little degradation and retained OPG as indicated by immunohistochemistry at 2 weeks post-implantation. Immunohistochemical analysis of implanted gels indicated that OPG induced nearly a 2-fold increase in vascular density in the surrounding foreign body capsule. These results suggest that the controlled delivery of OPG can stimulate angiogenesis in vivo and may be of use for wound healing therapies as well as other inflammatory and bone disorders in which OPG plays a role.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials science.

{"title": "Localization of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinases (MT1-MMP) and macrophages during early endochondral bone formation.", "abstract": "Endochondral bone formation, the process by which most parts of our skeleton evolve, leads to the establishment of the diaphyseal primary (POC) and epiphyseal secondary ossification centre (SOC) in long bones. An essential event for the development of the SOC is the early generation of vascularized cartilage canals that requires the proteolytic cleavage of the cartilaginous matrix. This in turn will allow the canals to grow into the epiphysis. In the present study we therefore initially investigated which enzymes and types of cells are involved in this process. We have chosen the mouse as an animal model and focused our studies on the distal part of the femur during early stages after birth. The formation of the cartilage canals was promoted by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinases (MT1-MMP). In addition, macrophages and cells containing numerous lysosomes contributed to the establishment of the canals and enabled their further advancement into the epiphysis. As development continued, the SOC was formed, and in mice aged 10 days a distinct layer of type I collagen (= osteoid) was laid down onto the cartilage scaffold. The events leading to the establishment of the SOC were compared with those of the POC. Basically these processes were quite similar, and in both ossification centers, TRAP-positive chondroclasts resorbed the cartilage matrix. However, occasionally co-expression of TRAP and MT1-MMP was noted in a small subpopulation of this cell type. Furthermore, numerous osteoblasts expressed MT1-MMP from the start of endochondral ossification, whereas others did not. In osteocytogenesis, MT1-MMP has been shown to be critical for the establishment of the cytoplasmic processes mediating the communication between osteocytes and bone-lining cells. Considering the well-known fact that not all osteoblasts transform into osteocytes, and in accordance with the present data, we suggest that MT1-MMP is needed at the very beginning of osteocytogenesis and may additionally determine whether an osteoblast further differentiates into an osteocyte.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2008-07-23", "authors": ["Michael J FBlumer", "StefanoLongato", "HelgaFritsch"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00958.x"}
{"title": "During vertebrate development, arteries exert a morphological control over the venous pattern through physical factors.", "abstract": "The adult vasculature is comprised of three distinct compartments: the arteries, which carry blood away from the heart and display a divergent flow pattern; the capillaries, where oxygen and nutrient delivery from blood to tissues, as well as metabolic waste removal, occurs; and the veins, which carry blood back to the heart and are characterized by a convergent flow pattern. These compartments are organized in series as regard to flow, which proceeds from the upstream arteries to the downstream veins through the capillaries. However, the spatial organization is more complex, as veins may often be found paralleling the arteries. The factors that control the morphogenesis of this hierarchically branched vascular network are not well characterized. Here, we explain how arteries exert a morphological control on the venous pattern. Indeed, during vertebrate development, the following transition may be observed in the spatial organization of the vascular system: veins first develop in series with the arteries, the arterial and venous territories being clearly distinct in space (cis-cis configuration). But after some time, new veins grow parallel to the existing arteries, and the arterial and venous territories become overlapped, with extensive and complex intercalation and interdigitation. Using physical arguments, backed up by experimental evidence (biological data from the literature and in situ optical and mechanical measurements of the chick embryo yolk-sac and midbrain developing vasculatures), we explain how such a transition is possible and why it may be expected with generality, as organisms grow. The origin of this transition lies in the remodeling of the capillary tissue in the vicinity of the growing arteries. This remodeling lays down a prepattern for further venous growth, parallel to the existing arterial pattern. Accounting for the influence of tissue growth, we show that this prepatterned path becomes favored as the body extends. As a consequence, a second flow route with veins paralleling the arteries (cis-trans configuration) emerges when the tissue extends. Between the cis-cis and cis-trans configurations, all configurations are in principle possible, and self-organization of the vessels contributes to determining their exact pattern. However, the global aspect depends on the size at which the growth stops and on the growth rate.", "journal": "Physical review.

Obviously, the investigation at multicellular and tissutal levels is much more complex.

ATM inhibits non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) growth by binding PKC iota and blocking activation of a PKC iota-Par6-Rac1-Pak-Mek 1,2-Erk 1,2 signaling pathway. Here, we assessed the growth inhibitory activity of ATM in a panel of human cell lines representing major lung cancer subtypes. ATM inhibited anchorage-independent growth in all lines tested with IC(50)s ranging from approximately 300 nmol/L to >100 micromol/L. ATM sensitivity correlates positively with expression of PKC iota and Par6, but not with the PKC iota binding protein p62, or the proposed targets of ATM in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), thioredoxin reductase 1 or 2. PKC iota expression profiling revealed that a significant subset of primary NSCLC tumors express PKC iota at or above the level associated with ATM sensitivity. ATM sensitivity is not associated with general sensitivity to the cytotoxic agents cis-platin, placitaxel, and gemcitabine. ATM inhibits tumorigenicity of both sensitive and insensitive lung cell tumors in vivo at plasma drug concentrations achieved in RA patients undergoing ATM therapy. ATM inhibits Mek/Erk signaling and decreases proliferative index without effecting tumor apoptosis or vascularization in vivo. We conclude that ATM exhibits potent antitumor activity against major lung cancer subtypes, particularly tumor cells that express high levels of the ATM target PKC iota and Par6.

The surgical treatment of clavicular pseudoarthrosis has been extensively reported in the literature. This article reports our experience of a definitive treatment strategy using free vascularized fibula flaps in cases of persistent compression of the brachial plexus by relapsing bony nonunion mass lesions.\nSix men (age range, 46-59 yr) and two women (ages 48 and 52 yr) with nonunions of clavicular midshaft fractures were referred between August 2001 and March 2005 because of progressive compression of the subclavicular neurovascular bundle. All of them had displaced traumatic clavicle fractures that had been treated previously at other institutions. At least two surgical reconstructive procedures had been performed beforehand. Four patients had motor deficits owing to compressive brachial plexus lesions; all showed symptoms of combined thoracic outlet syndrome. Our surgery consisted of resection of the space-occupying clavicular pseudoarthrosis (all eight patients), external neurolysis of the brachial plexus (four patients) and reconstruction of the resulting bone defect with free vascularized fibula flap secured with plates (all eight patients). Vascularity of the bone flap was studied using three-phase bone scintigraphy.\nAll patients became free of pain symptoms after surgery. Muscle strength in two of the four patients with preoperative motor deficits improved to normal within 3 months; the other two patients required 6 and 8 months, respectively. Three-phase bone scintigraphy showed adequate perfusion of the bone flaps in all patients. Postoperative bleeding at the recipient site occurred in three patients; these required revision. One patient showed an osseosubcutaneous fistula 6 months after surgery, which was treated conservatively. There was no recurrence of pseudoarthrosis or neurovascular compression at a mean follow-up period of 38.5 months.\nRecurrent space-occupying pseudoarthrosis of the clavicle complicated with neurovascular compression might warrant definitive reconstruction using a free vascularized bone flap.", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "date": "2008-07-18", "authors": ["Kartik GKrishnan", "DirkMucha", "RanjanGupta", "GabrieleSchackert"], "doi": "10.1227/01.neu.0000326036.54714.17"}

The use of colon patch esophagoplasty (CPE) was originally described for the correction of long segment esophageal stenosis, however it was thought that the length of the stricture would limit the use of the patch technique. We performed CPE on 3- to 4-inch strictures with a good outcome.\nWe report here on our results of the use of CPE for long and short ES.\nA retrospective study was carried out on patients operated for resistant ES using a vascularized colonic patch. The technique used was the same as described by Hecker and Hollmann with a few modifications. We used the right colon. Instead of passing the patch through the hiatus we placed it in the right pleural cavity through a small incision in the diaphragm. An appropriately sized patch was sewn to a generous longitudinal esophagotomy extending well beyond the stricture using running 4/0 polydiaxone sutures.\nFour patients underwent CPE, three because of an extensive caustic stricture and one with a stricture after failed atresia repair. All four patients were males. They were almost the same age except for the one with post-tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) repair stricture. The site of the stricture was the mid esophagus in three and the lower esophagus in one. Three patients had an anastomatic leak which was treated conservatively and one patient required a postoperative fundoplication 10 days post-CPE to stop the leak. The first patient developed a patch diverticulum, which was resected 12 years after CPE. All had fundoplication pre-, intra- or post-CPE. The follow-up period ranged from 4 - 20 years. All patients are eating and growing normally after surgery. No malignant changes were seen in the older patient.\nThe length of the stricture is not a problem in CPE. Our results are encouraging on the use of CPE as an alternative to esophageal replacement. We suggest using CPE even for an entire scarred esophagus. A postoperative leak due to a long suture line can be overcome by fundoplication and supportive therapy.", "journal": "European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

The rats were randomly divided into three groups, a sham group consisting of five rats and the other two groups consisting of ten rats. In group 1 (sham group), right orchiectomy with no additional intervention was performed. In group 2 (T/D group), torsion was created by rotating the testis 720 degrees in a clockwise direction for 4 h. After a 4-h torsion period, the right testis was detorted and replaced into the scrotum for 4 h. After the torsion, 0.5 cc 0.9% NaCl solution was injected once and three times in a week (total 12 doses). In group 3 (T/D + erythropoietin; EPO group), the same surgical procedure was done as in group 1, but EPO 1,000 IU/kg was injected just before the detorsion and three times in a week. At the end of each procedure, bilateral orchiectomies were performed for the histopathological examinations in all groups.\nWe examined the testes weight, vascularization of the region between the seminiferous tubules, percentage of necrotic seminipherous tubules, and maturation of spermatogenesis in terms of necrosis, sertoli cells, maturation arrest of spermatogenesis, hypospermatogenesis, and normal spermatogenesis of torsioned testis tissues with and without EPO treatment. Extremely significant differences in testicular weight were observed in group 1 compared to groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.001).\nAdministration of EPO significantly influenced the rescue of testicular function by preserving the intact seminiferous tubular morphology, lowering the percentage of necrotic seminipherous tubules, and significantly reducing histological damage (P < 0.05).", "journal": "International urology and nephrology", "date": "2008-07-16", "authors": ["BurhanK\u00f6seo\u011flu", "EnginYilmaz", "KadirCeylan", "ErsanUzun", "IrfanBayram", "FatihHizli"], "doi": "10.1007/s11255-008-9418-8"}

In the remaining five eyes, we could not determine definitively whether the branching vessels were occluded completely. Recurrent serous changes occurred in nine eyes (33%) 14-48 months after the last PDT. ICGA revealed that these changes were caused by new polypoidal lesions that originated from further-grown branches of the persistent branching vascular network.

To our knowledge, this is the first study applying the extended-dissection technique as described by Hasen et al. to pedicled gracilis flaps.\nA chart review conducted from 2003 to 2006 identified 19 consecutive patients as having undergone an extended gracilis dissection. Once the pedicle is identified on the medial border of the gracilis, dissection continues proximally, dividing the rich vascular network of perforators to the adductor muscles. The gracilis is then passed beneath the adductor longus and delivered adjacent to the sartorius, where dissection proceeds directly down to the profunda femoris.\nAll reconstructions were successful. There was one complication presenting as a late infection at the donor site. Mean patient age was 66 years and nearly all patients had multiple significant comorbidities, including diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and/or radiation therapy.\nThe extended-dissection technique for gracilis harvest has significant benefits for use in pedicled flaps, including a greater arc of rotation and no restriction on postoperative ambulation or thigh abduction. These factors are particularly important in the challenging patient population represented in this study and add to the reliability and versatility of the gracilis flap.

Recent trends in the reconstruction of the skull defect following this type of surgery have focused on addressing two postoperative morbidities: cerebrospinal fluid leak and postauricular deformity. Various reconstructive paradigms have shown an improvement in both areas over traditional techniques. Options for addressing these problems continue to evolve as surgeons strive to improve patient satisfaction. This review highlights such reconstructive options and their respective challenges.\nCurrent techniques include the use of various materials such as hydroxyapatite, titanium and vascularized cortical bone flap. Hydroxyapatite and titanium mesh alloplastic reconstruction are associated with improved outcome but increased surgical cost. Vascularized cranioplasty bone flap appears to achieve the same endpoint with no added cost.\nCranioplasty following translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma excision has evolved in an effort to reduce postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks and cosmetic deformities.

In this study, we show that in addition to its matrix-degrading activity, phosphorylation of MT1-MMP on its unique tyrosine residue located within its cytoplasmic sequence (Tyr573) may also participate to these processes. Fibrosarcoma cells expressing a proteolytically active but non-phosphorylable mutant of MT1-MMP showed a markedly reduced proliferation rate when embedded within 3D type I collagen matrices, this antiproliferative effect being correlated with arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of MT1-MMP also inhibits anchorage-independent growth of HT-1080 cells in soft agar as well as their invasion of collagen barriers, two prominent attributes of tumor cells, suggesting a broad inhibitory effect of the MT1-MMP mutant on tumorigenesis. Accordingly, whereas HT-1080 cells formed well-vascularized tumors containing tyrosine-phosphorylated MT1-MMP, tumor growth was completely abolished by expression of the non-phosphorylable MT1-MMP mutant. These findings thus indicate a close co-operation between the matrix-degrading activity of MT1-MMP and tyrosine phosphorylation of its intracellular domain for tumor cell invasion and proliferation and suggest that the targeting of the intracellular signaling pathways leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of MT1-MMP may represent an unexpected alternative strategy for the inhibition of this enzyme.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2008-07-16", "authors": ["CarineNyalendo", "EdithBeaulieu", "Herv\u00e9Sartelet", "MarisolMichaud", "NicolasFontaine", "DenisGingras", "RichardB\u00e9liveau"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgn159"}

{"title": "The immune system and cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of cardiac injury and results in acute loss of a large number of myocardial cells. Because the heart has negligible regenerative capacity, cardiomyocyte death triggers a reparative response that ultimately results in formation of a scar and is associated with dilative remodeling of the ventricle. Cardiac injury activates innate immune mechanisms initiating an inflammatory reaction. Toll-like receptor-mediated pathways, the complement cascade and reactive oxygen generation induce nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and upregulate chemokine and cytokine synthesis in the infarcted heart. Chemokines stimulate the chemotactic recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes into the infarct, while cytokines promote adhesive interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, resulting in transmigration of inflammatory cells into the site of injury. Monocyte subsets play distinct roles in phagocytosis of dead cardiomyocytes and in granulation tissue formation through the release of growth factors. Clearance of dead cells and matrix debris may be essential for resolution of inflammation and transition into the reparative phase. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta plays a crucial role in cardiac repair by suppressing inflammation while promoting myofibroblast phenotypic modulation and extracellular matrix deposition. Myofibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis result in formation of highly vascularized granulation tissue. As the healing infarct matures, fibroblasts become apoptotic and a collagen-based matrix is formed, while many infarct neovessels acquire a muscular coat and uncoated vessels regress. Timely resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and spatial containment of the inflammatory and reparative response into the infarcted area are essential for optimal infarct healing. Targeting inflammatory pathways following infarction may reduce cardiomyocyte injury and attenuate adverse remodeling. In addition, understanding the role of the immune system in cardiac repair is necessary in order to design optimal strategies for cardiac regeneration.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2008-07-16", "authors": ["Nikolaos GFrangogiannis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2008.06.007"}

Expression was further analyzed in the novel setting of recovery from heart failure in myocardium obtained from patients who received combined mechanical (left ventricular assist device) and pharmacological therapy. Real-time PCR revealed that FSTL1 and FSTL3 expression was elevated in heart failure but returned to normal after recovery. FSTL3 expression levels correlated with molecular markers of disease severity and FSTL1 with the endothelial cell marker CD31, suggesting a potential link with vascularization. FSTL1 levels before treatment correlated with cardiac function after recovery, suggesting initial levels may influence long-term outcome. Immunohistochemistry revealed that FST was primarily localized to fibroblasts and vascular endothelium within the heart, whereas FSTL1 was localized to myocytes, endothelium, and smooth muscle cells and FSLT3 to myocytes and endothelium. Microarray analysis revealed that FST and FSTL1 were associated with extracellular matrix-related and calcium-binding proteins, whereas FSTL3 was associated mainly with cell signaling and transcription.

This study investigated the involvement of KLF5 (Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5), an Sp/KLF family member, in the skeletal development. KLF5 was expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts but not in osteoclasts. The heterozygous deficient (KLF5+/-) mice exhibited skeletal growth retardation in the perinatal period. Although chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation were normal, cartilage matrix degradation was impaired in KLF5+/- mice, causing delay in replacement of cartilage with bone at the primary ossification center in the embryonic limbs and elongation of hypertrophic chondrocyte layer in the neonatal growth plates. Microarray analyses identified MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) as a transcriptional target, since it was strongly up-regulated by adenoviral transfection of KLF5 in chondrogenic cell line OUMS27. The KLF5 overexpression caused gelatin degradation by stimulating promoter activity of MMP9 without affecting chondrocyte differentiation or vascular endothelial growth factor expression in the culture of chondrogenic cells; however, in osteoclast precursors, it affected neither MMP9 expression nor osteoclastic differentiation. KLF5 dysfunction by genetic heterodeficiency or RNA interference was confirmed to cause reduction of MMP9 expression in cultured chondrogenic cells. MMP9 expression was decreased in the limbs of KLF5+/- embryos, which was correlated with suppression of matrix degradation, calcification, and vascularization.

{"title": "Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD)", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor, is a homodimeric glycoprotein weighing ~45 kDa (1). The VEGF family consists of six groups: VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and the placental growth factor (PIGF) (2). Structurally, VEGFs are related to the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), and they all contain the characteristic eight-cysteine residues known as the cysteine knot motif (3). Intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds are formed between these cysteine residues in conserved positions (2). VEGFs bind specifically to three cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases, including fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) or VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) or VEGRF-2, and Flt-4 or VEGFR-3. Each VEGFR contains a 750-amino acid-residue extracellular domain that is organized into seven immunoglobulin-like folds. VEGF and VEGFRs have been implicated in angiogenesis in many solid tumors, including breast cancer, colon cancer, hepatoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer (3). VEGFR-2 (~220 kDa) is expressed exclusively in endothelial cells in cell differentiation, tumor vascularization, and metastasis. VEGF-A (the original VEGF) binds to the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin G loop of VEGFR-2 with a dissociation constant of ~100 pM (4). Hypoxia appears to be an important stimulus for producing VEGF in malignant and normal endothelial cells (3). Upon binding to its receptor VEGFR-2, VEGF-A elicits a pronounced angiogenic response, so it is considered as a predominant stimulator of angiogenesis. Human VEGF-A has five different isoforms generated by alternative slicing of a single pre-mRNA species, VEGF-A", "journal": NaN, "date": "2004", "authors": ["HuimingZhang"], "doi": null}

Upon growth of an atherosclerotic lesion in the intima, neovascular sprouts originating from the adventitial vasa vasorum enter the lesion, the local proangiogenic micromilieu in the lesion being created by intramural hypoxia, by increased intramural oxidant stress, and by inflammatory cell infiltration (macrophages, T cells and mast cells). The angiogenic factors present in the lesions include various growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, proteinases, and several other factors possessing direct or indirect angiogenic activities, while the current list of antiangiogenic factors is smaller. An imbalance between endogenous inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis, with a predominance of the former ones, is essential for the development of neovessels during the progression of the lesion. By providing oxygen and nutrients to the cells of atherosclerotic lesions, neovascularization initially tends to prevent cellular death and so contributes to plaque growth and stabilization. However, the inflammatory cells may induce rupture of the fragile neovessels, and so cause intraplaque hemorrhage and ensuing plaque destabilization. Pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis in atherosclerotic plaques with ensuing inhibition of lesion progression has been achieved in animal models, but clinical studies aiming at regulation of angiogenesis in the atherosclerotic arterial wall can be designed only after we have reached a firm conclusion about the role of angiogenesis at various stages of lesion development--good or bad.", "journal": "Annals of medicine", "date": "2008-07-09", "authors": ["DomenicoRibatti", "FrancescaLevi-Schaffer", "Petri TKovanen"], "doi": "10.1080/07853890802186913"}

However, its physiological role during vascular development and neovascularization remains elusive. Here we investigated the role of PEDF in normal postnatal vascularization of retina and retinal neovascularization during oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR) using PEDF-deficient (PEDF-/-) mice. The beta-galactosidase staining of eye sections from PEDF-/- mice confirmed the expression pattern of endogenous PEDF previously reported in mouse retina. However, strongest staining was observed in the retinal outer plexiform layer. Retinal trypsin digests indicated that the ratio of endothelial cells (EC) to pericytes (PC) was significantly higher in PEDF-/- mice compared to wild type (PEDF+/+) mice at postnatal day 21 (P21). This was mainly attributed to increased numbers of EC in the absence of PEDF. There was no significant difference in the number of PC. We observed an increased rate of proliferation in retinal vasculature of PEDF-/- mice, which was somewhat compensated for by an increase in the rate of apoptosis. Staining of the retinal wholemounts and eye frozen sections indicated postnatal retinal vascularization expansion occurred at a faster rate in the absence of PEDF, and was more prominent at early time points (prior to P21). The retinal vascularization in PEDF+/+ mice reaches that of PEDF-/- mice such that no significant difference in vascular densities was observed by P42. Lack of PEDF had a minimal effect on the regression of hyaloid vasculature and VEGF levels. PEDF-/- mice also exhibited enhanced sensitivity to hyperoxia-mediated vessel obliteration during OIR compared to PEDF+/+ mice despite higher levels of VEGF. However, there was no significant difference in the degree of retinal neovascularization.

The growth plate, the essential structure for longitudinal bone growth, is located between these two sites of ossification. Basically, endochondral bone development depends upon neovascularization, and the early generation of vascularized cartilage canals is an initial event, clearly preceding the formation of the SOC. These canals form a discrete network within the cartilaginous epiphysis giving rise to the formation of the marrow space followed by the establishment of the SOC. These processes require excavation of the provisional cartilaginous matrix which is eventually replaced by permanent bone matrix. In this review, we discuss the formation of the cartilage canals and the importance of their cells in the ossification process. Special attention is paid to the enzymes required in disintegration of the cartilaginous matrix which, in turn, will allow for the invasion of new vessels. Furthermore, we show that the mesenchymal cells of the cartilage canals express bone-relevant proteins and transform into osteocytes. We conclude that the canals are essential for normal epiphyseal bone development, the establishment of the growth plate and ultimately longitudinal growth of the bones.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2008-07-08", "authors": ["Michael J FBlumer", "StefanoLongato", "HelgaFritsch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2008.02.004"}

In this study, we analyzed the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on human pancreatic islet microendothelial cells as well as the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and nephrin pathways, interleukin-1beta, and nitric oxide production. In addition, whether 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors can reverse the response to high-glucose conditions was investigated. Proliferation of purified islet microendothelial cells cultured under hyperglycemic conditions (28 mmol/L glucose) decreased compared to that of normoglycemic cells (from 12.7% after 2 days to 47.7% after 30 days, P < 0.05). In parallel, apoptosis progressively increased from 7% after 2 days to 79% after 30 days in high glucose (P < 0.05) concomitant with an early increase of caspase-3 activity. Intermittent hyperglycemia induced greater apoptosis than sustained hyperglycemia. Apoptosis was accompanied by a reduced p-Akt/Akt ratio and inhibition of nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Pravastatin (1 mumol/L) decreased apoptosis induced by high glucose or oxidized LDL and increased Akt phosphorylation. Hyperglycemia significantly increased the production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta and stimulated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide, possibly relevant to beta cell mass and function. Thus, chronic hyperglycemia reduces islet microendothelial cell survival by inhibiting the serine-threonine kinase Akt pathway, and the effect of pravastatin on this pathway represents a potential tool to improve islet vascularization and, indirectly, islet function.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2008-07-05", "authors": ["EnricaFavaro", "IlariaMiceli", "BenedettaBussolati", "MichelSchmitt-Ney", "PaoloCavallo Perin", "GiovanniCamussi", "Maria MZanone"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2008.080238"}

Human NCM460 colonocytes stably transfected with the human NK-1R (NCM460-NK-1R cells) and mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis were used. We found that expression of the angiogenic factor CCN1 was increased in the colons of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Mucosal extracts from inflammatory bowel disease patients induced human intestinal microvascular endothelial cell migration that was inhibited by blockade of CCN1 and its receptor integrin alphavbeta3. Both the degree of angiogenesis and CCN1 expression were elevated in the colons of mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, which was reduced by treatment with the NK-1R antagonist CJ-12255. SP also increased CCN1 expression in NCM460-NK-1R colonocytes. SP exposure to human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells co-cultured with NCM460-NK-1R cells induced angiogenic activity that was inhibited by CCN1 silencing.

{"title": "Gap junction communication between uterine stromal cells plays a critical role in pregnancy-associated neovascularization and embryo survival.", "abstract": "In the uterus, the formation of new maternal blood vessels in the stromal compartment at the time of embryonic implantation is critical for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Although uterine angiogenesis is known to be influenced by the steroid hormones estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), the underlying molecular pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), a major gap junction protein, is markedly enhanced in response to E in uterine stromal cells surrounding the implanted embryo during the early phases of pregnancy. Conditional deletion of the Cx43 gene in these stromal cells and the consequent disruption of their gap junctions led to a striking impairment in the development of new blood vessels within the stromal compartment, resulting in the arrest of embryo growth and early pregnancy loss. Further analysis of this phenotypical defect revealed that loss of Cx43 expression resulted in aberrant differentiation of uterine stromal cells and impaired production of several key angiogenic factors, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf). Ablation of CX43 expression in human endometrial stromal cells in vitro led to similar findings. Collectively, these results uncovered a unique link between steroid hormone-regulated cell-cell communication within the pregnant uterus and the development of an elaborate vascular network that supports embryonic growth.

VEGFR-3 (also known as FLT-4) is present in all endothelia during development, and in the adult it becomes restricted to the lymphatic endothelium. However, VEGFR-3 is upregulated in the microvasculature of tumours and wounds. Here we demonstrate that VEGFR-3 is highly expressed in angiogenic sprouts, and genetic targeting of VEGFR-3 or blocking of VEGFR-3 signalling with monoclonal antibodies results in decreased sprouting, vascular density, vessel branching and endothelial cell proliferation in mouse angiogenesis models. Stimulation of VEGFR-3 augmented VEGF-induced angiogenesis and sustained angiogenesis even in the presence of VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR or FLK-1) inhibitors, whereas antibodies against VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 in combination resulted in additive inhibition of angiogenesis and tumour growth. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological disruption of the Notch signalling pathway led to widespread endothelial VEGFR-3 expression and excessive sprouting, which was inhibited by blocking VEGFR-3 signals.

This study investigates the use of a new imaging technique, flat-panel detector volume computed tomography (fpVCT), to monitor in vivo tumor progression and structural changes within tumors of two murine carcinoma models. After tumor cell inoculation, single fpVCT scans of the entire mice were performed at different time points. The acquired isotropic, high-resolution volume data sets enable an accurate real-time assessment and precise measurements of tumor volumes. Spreading of contrast agent-containing blood vessels around and within the tumors was clearly visible over time. Furthermore, fpVCT permits the identification of differences in the uptake of contrast media within tumors, thus delineating necrosis, tumor tissues, and blood vessels. Classification of tumor tissues based on the decomposition of the underlying mixture distribution of tissue-related Hounsfield units allowed the quantitative acquisition of necrotic tissues at each time point. Morphologic alterations of the tumor depicted by fpVCT were confirmed by histopathologic examination. Concluding, our data show that fpVCT may be highly suitable for the noninvasive evaluation of tumor responses to anticancer therapies during the course of the disease.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2008-07-02", "authors": ["JeannineMissbach-Guentner", "ChristianDullin", "SarahKimmina", "MartaZientkowska", "MelanieDomeyer-Missbach", "CordulaMalz", "EckhardtGrabbe", "WalterSt\u00fchmer", "FraukeAlves"], "doi": "10.1593/neo.08270"}

In the present study, we hypothesized that even sub-apoptotic concentrations of oxLDL impair the angiogenic potential of EPC and investigated if this effect is mediated by affecting adhesion and incorporation.\nA co-culture system of human microvascular endothelial cells and EPC was used to study the effect of sub-apoptotic concentrations of native (nLDL) and oxLDL on cell-cell interaction. The expression and the functional role of angiogenic adhesion molecules and integrins was monitored by FACS and neutralizing assay, respectively.\nWe observed an inhibition of tube formation and impairment of EPC integration into the vascular network of mature endothelial cells by oxLDL. In contrast, nLDL did not affect angiogenic properties of EPC. Incubation of EPC with sub-apoptotic oxLDL concentrations significantly decreased E-selectin and integrin alpha(v)beta(5) expression (37.6% positive events vs. 71.5% and 24.3% vs. 49.9% compared to control culture media without oxLDL). Interestingly, expression of alpha(v)beta(3), VE-cadherin and CD31 remained unchanged. Blocking of E-selectin and integrin alpha(v)beta(5) by neutralizing antibody effectively inhibited adhesion of EPC to differentiated endothelial cells (56.5% and 41.9% of control; p<0.001).\nIn conclusion, oxidative alteration of LDL impairs angiogenic properties of EPC at sub-apoptotic levels by downregulation of E-selectin and integrin alpha(v)beta(5), both substantial mediators of EPC-endothelial cell interaction.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2008-07-02", "authors": ["StefanoDi Santo", "NicolasDiehm", "JanaOrtmann", "JanV\u00f6lzmann", "ZijiangYang", "Hong-HakKeo", "IrisBaumgartner", "ChristophKalka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.06.066"}
{"title": "Therapeutic potential of novel modulators of neovascularization.", "abstract": "Neovacularization is an important biological process whereby new blood vessels develop in both health and disease. During development, blood vessels are formed from mesodermal cells in a process called vasculogenesis. The vascular network then expands by the sprouting of new vessel networks from pre-established vessels in a process known as angiogenesis. However, in adult life, undesirable neovascularization is associated with tumor development and a growing list of 'angiogenesis-dependent' diseases, including cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, diseases characterized by ischemia-induced tissue damage cause a neovascularization response to facilitate tissue repair. Recent research has identified novel molecular and cellular mediators of neovascularization that, in adult life, recapitulate angiogenic processes observed during embryonic development. The discovery of vascular progenitor cells and new molecules that display selective functions in modulating endothelial cell fate, migration and patterning, vessel morphogenesis and the amplification of angiogenic signaling by regulating the master signal VEGF, opens the door to new clinical strategies that target angiogenesis-dependent diseases or that can promote therapeutic neovascularization.", "journal": "Future cardiology", "date": "2008-07-01", "authors": ["SalmanRahman", "Yatin MPatel", "Errol SWijelath", "Michael SSobel"], "doi": "10.2217/14796678.4.4.409"}

Because there was experimental evidence for the role of IL-17 in acute rejection of vascularized allografts, we undertook the present study to assess the function of IL-22 in the process. There was an early transient expression of IL-22 in C57BL/6 mouse cardiac allografts (2-4 days posttransplantation) transplanted to BALB/c recipients. The main source of IL-22 among infiltrating leukocytes was cells expressing the macrophage/monocyte markers Mac3 and CD11b. T cells and granulocytes present in the rejected graft did not express IL-22. Surprisingly, the absence of IL-22 accelerated the rejection of fully histoincompatible hearts. Histology of rejected organs revealed the presence of intensive intragraft thrombosis and disseminated hemorrhagic necrosis.

Lymphatics were immunohistologically detected by D2-40/LYVE-1 staining. Absorbing lymphatic vessels were localized in papillary dermis and around skin appendages with distinctive morphology. In chalazion, D2-40 reactive flattened lymphatic profiles were compressed by inflammatory infiltrate; in dermatochalasis, large fully opened lymphatics were observed, with a significantly wider total area (lymphatic lumina/200x field; p < 0.05). The lymphatic density (number/200x field) in the two groups was within the same range. Lymphatic dilation is possibly dependent on reduction and fragmentation of the dermal elastic network as well as of oxytalanic fibers in the papillary dermis of dermatochalasis, as shown by Weigert's reaction. Multifunctional peptide ET-1, involved in vasomotion, inflammation and connective proliferation, was faintly and discontinuously localized on lymphatics, as was its type A receptor. In contrast, the consistent expression of type B receptor indicates that lymphatic endothelium is a physiological target for ET-1, whose effects are modulated by multiple pathophysiological conditions.

KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the infectious cause of this highly vascularized skin tumor. The main cell type found within a KS lesion, the spindle cell, is latently infected with KSHV and has markers of both blood and lymphatic endothelial cells. During development, lymphatic endothelial cells differentiate from preexisting blood endothelial cells. Interestingly, KSHV infection of blood endothelial cells induces lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation. Here, we show that KSHV gene expression is necessary to maintain the expression of the lymphatic markers vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) and podoplanin. KSHV infection activates many cell signaling pathways in endothelial cells and persistently activates STAT3 through the gp130 receptor, the common receptor of the interleukin 6 family of cytokines. We find that KSHV infection also activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase (PI3K)/Akt cell signaling pathway in latently infected endothelial cells and that gp130 receptor signaling is necessary for Akt activation. Using both pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA knockdown, we show that the gp130 receptor-mediated activation of both the JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt cell signaling pathways is necessary for KSHV-induced lymphatic reprogramming of endothelial cells. The induction of the lymphatic endothelial cell-specific transcription factor Prox1 is also involved in KSHV-induced lymphatic reprogramming.

Tumors produced in mice by injection of human and murine tumor cells transduced with Dll4 were significantly smaller, less vascularized and more hypoxic than controls, and displayed evidence of Notch activation.

All women underwent transvaginal sonographic 3D PDA on the day of maximum pain after the onset of menstruation or during the first 24 to 48 hours of the new cycle if no pain was present. Three groups were defined according to a visual analog scale: no pain to mild dysmenorrhea, moderate dysmenorrhea, and severe dysmenorrhea. Vascularity assessment was done on the basis of 3D vascularity indices: the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization-flow index (VFI).\nThe mean VI and VFI for the inner 5 mm of the myometrium and the total myometrium were significantly higher in the women with severe dysmenorrhea than in those with no pain to mild dysmenorrhea (P < .05). The VI, FI, and VFI in the women with moderate dysmenorrhea did not differ significantly from those in the women with severe dysmenorrhea.\nThis study evaluated the use of 3D PDA for assessing uterine and specifically myometrial vascularization.

Tumor sizes varied from 1.5 cm x 1.0 cm to 7.0 cm x 5.0 cm. The plain X-ray, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and histology examination were obtained at various time points after operation. The in vivo biodegradation rate of the implanted TCP was evaluated based on a semi-quantitive radiographic analyzing method. Histopathology examination was performed in 1 revision case.\nAll the patients were followed up for 5 to 24 months after operation. They all had good wound healing and bone regeneration. There was neither significant reverse reaction to the transplanted material nor locally inflammatory reaction in all of the cases. The bone defects were repaired gradually from 1 to 6 months after operation (bone healing at average 2.6 months after surgery) with a bone healing rate up to 96.7%. There was only 1 recurrence case (eosinophilic granuloma in ischium) 3 months after operation. Given revision operation, this case gained bone healing. Radiographically, the interface between the implanted bone and host bone became fuzzy 1 month after implantation, indicating the beginning of new bone formation. Three months later, the absorption of the interporous TCP was noticed from peripheral to the center of the implanted bone evidenced by the vague or fuzzy realm. New bone formation could be seen both in peripheral and central areas. Six months later, implanted bone and host bone merged together and the bone defect was totally repaired, with 78.9% degradation rate of the implanted TCP. Twelve months later, the majority of the implanted bone was absorbed and bone remodeling was established. In the cases that were followed up for 24 months, the function of affected extremity was excellent with good bone remodeling without recurrence. In 2 cases, SPECT showed that nuclide uptake could be observed in implanted site and the metabolic activity was high both in the central as well as the peripheral areas of the graft 1 month after implantation, which was an evidence of osteogenesis. Pathologically, the interporous TCP closely contacted the host bone inside the humerus 1 month after grafting. The interface between the implanted bone and host bone became fuzzy, and vascularized tissue began growing inside the implanted graft as a \"lining\" structure.\nThe interporous TCP proves to be effective for clinical reparation of bone defects following tumor resection. The inside three-dimensional porous structure simulates the natural bionic bone structure which is suitable for recruitment related cells in-growth into the scaffold, colonizing and proliferation companied with the process of vascularize, finally with the new bone formation.

In this study, we have correlated microvascular density and leptin/leptin receptor (Ob-R) expression in endothelial and tumor cells with the histopathological type in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For this purpose, specimens of 40 primary HCC were submitted to immunohistochemical investigation using anti-CD31, anti-leptin and anti-Ob-R antibodies. Poorly-differentiated HCC had a higher degree of vascularization than other stages and leptin/Ob-R expression in both tumor and endothelial cells increased in parallel with the grade of malignancy and was highly correlated with the degree of angiogenesis. In the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane in vivo assay, HCC biopsy specimens induced a strong angiogenic response, which was counteracted by an anti-leptin antibody.

All patients underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound, pre- and post-contrast triple-phase CT, and perfusion computed tomographic study using multidetector 16-slice CT. Six parameters related to the blood microcirculation and tissue perfusion were measured for the focal liver lesion and cirrhotic parenchyma: perfusion (P), tissue blood volume (BV), hepatic perfusion index (HPI), arterial perfusion (AP), portal perfusion (PP), and time to peak (TTP). Perfusion parameters were described with quartile values of their distribution; univariate paired and unpaired Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used for statistical analysis.\nHCC was diagnosed in 21 of the 47 patients; in the remaining 26, HCC was not found at contrast-enhanced ultrasound and multidetector 16-slice computed tomographic study.

However, whether different subsets of these cells have different roles in this process is unclear. To investigate the roles of BM-derived progenitor cell subpopulations in the formation of tumor vasculature in a Ewing's sarcoma model, we used a functional assay based on endothelial cell and pericyte differentiation in vivo. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of human cord blood/BM or mouse BM from green fluorescent protein transgenic mice was used to isolate human CD34+/CD38(-), CD34+/CD45+, and CD34(-)/CD45+ cells and mouse Sca1+/Gr1+, Sca1(-)/Gr1+, VEGFR1+, and VEGFR2+ cells. Each of these progenitor subpopulations was separately injected intravenously into nude mice bearing Ewing's sarcoma tumors. Tumors were resected 1 week later and analyzed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy for the presence of migrated progenitor cells expressing endothelial, pericyte, or inflammatory cell surface markers. We showed two distinct patterns of stem cell infiltration. Human CD34+/CD45+ and CD34+/CD38(-) and murine VEGFR2+ and Sca1+/Gr1+ cells migrated to Ewing's tumors, colocalized with the tumor vascular network, and differentiated into cells expressing either endothelial markers (mouse CD31 or human vascular endothelial cadherin) or the pericyte markers desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. By contrast, human CD34(-)/CD45+ and mouse Sca1(-)/Gr1+ cells migrated predominantly to sites outside of the tumor vasculature and differentiated into monocytes/macrophages expressing F4/80 or CD14.

Patients were treated within clinical trials testing the addition of concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy.\nAn expression signature dominated by HOX genes, which comprises Prominin-1 (CD133), emerged as a predictor for poor survival in patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy (n = 42; hazard ratio = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.26; P = .004).

Taken together, these data suggest that systemic IGF-I has potent actions during early RCC tumor development with a sustained long-term effect on proliferation and neovascularization although with progression, later tumors appear to become desensitized to systemic IGF-I effects.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2008-06-19", "authors": ["Ann HRosendahl", "Jeff M PHolly", "MonaCelander", "G\u00f6ranForsberg"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.23642"}

A modified protocol for whole organ cryopreservation was described and the outcome of cryopreservative ovaries was evaluated, and apoptosis of cryopreservative cells stored for different time period and the viability of cryopreserved cells stored at different temperature was examined in rats. Lewis rat ovarian grafts were perfused for 30 min at 0.35 ml/min with M2 medium containing 0.1M fructose and increasing concentrations of 0-1.5M dimethylsulfoxide, cooled to -140 degrees C controlled by a computerized program, and stored in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) for 24 hours. After being thawed, ovaries were transplanted to syngeneic recipients after bilateral oophorectomy. Graft functions were monitored postoperatively. The major findings were that: 1) A 100% survival rate of rat ovaries was achieved in this study. Ovarian hormone secretion recovered in 80% rats which had received cryopreservative ovarian grafts. Postoperative serum estradiol levels in the cryopreservative graft group were lower than in the sham surgery control, but much higher than in the bilateral oophorectomy group. 2) Histological examination of cryopreservative ovarian grafts showed preantral and antral follicles. Two gestations were obtained. 3) Estradiol levels remained low in ovariectomized rats while in the oophorectomized rats given cryopreservative ovarian grafts levels started to rise after 14 +/- 3 days. 4) The average viability in the cells from cryopreservative ovary organ (-196 degrees C) was about 71 +/- 18% compared to 90 +/- 9% of fresh cells.

A 20-year-old nulligravid woman presented with a large solid pelvic mass and abdominal mass. On examination a solid mass was found which extended from the pelvis until over the umbilical transversal line. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a solid non-homogenous mass originating from the right ovary with largest diameter of over 30 cm, fine internal echoes, regular margins, and poor vascularization. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) image was non-contributory. Blood work including hematology and biochemistry was normal. There was no sign of systemic infection and the tumour markers are negative. Unilateral adnexectomy was performed during exploratory laparotomy. Histological examination demonstrated massive ovarian edema. The adnexa weighted 1,585 g. Massive edema of the ovary remains difficult to diagnose before surgery because it may clinically and radiologically mimic an ovarian neoplasm.

{"title": "Fetal growth restriction triggered by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is associated with altered placental vasculature and AhR-dependent changes in cell death.", "abstract": "Maternal cigarette smoking is considered an important risk factor associated with fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are well-known constituents of cigarette smoke, and the effects of acute exposure to these chemicals at different gestational stages have been well established in a variety of laboratory animals. In addition, many PAHs are known ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a cellular xenobiotic sensor responsible for activating the metabolic machinery. In this study, we have applied a chronic, low-dose regimen of PAH exposure to C57Bl/6 female mice before conception. This treatment caused IUGR in day 15.5 post coitum (d15.5) fetuses and yielded abnormalities in the placental vasculature, resulting in significantly reduced arterial surface area and volume of the fetal arterial vasculature of the placenta. However, examination of the small vasculature within the placental labyrinth of PAH-exposed dams revealed extensive branching and enlargement of these vessels, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism. These alterations in vascularization were accompanied by reduced placental cell death rates, increased expression levels of antiapoptotic Xiap, and decreased expression of proapoptotic Bax, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, and active caspase-3. AhR-deficient fetuses were rescued from PAH-induced growth restriction and exhibited no changes in the labyrinthine cell death rate. The results of this investigation suggest that chronic exposure to PAHs is a contributing factor to the development of IUGR in human smokers and that the AhR pathway is involved.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We compared the properties of VEGF-A165b with those of VEGF-A121, VEGF-A145, and VEGF-A165. Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in VEGFR-2 differed between the VEGF ligands as determined by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and by use of phosphosite-specific antibodies. VEGF-A165b was considerably poorer in inducing phosphorylation of the positive regulatory site Y1052 in VEGFR-2. Whereas this did not affect activation of VEGFR-2 in vitro, we show that VEGF-A165b failed to induce vasculogenesis and sprouting angiogenesis in differentiating embryonic stem cells and vascularization of s.c. Matrigel plugs. In addition, the ability of the different VEGF ligands to induce angiogenesis correlated with their abilities to bind the VEGF coreceptor neuropilin 1 (NRP1).

{"title": "Endothelial function of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene: control of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling.", "abstract": "von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease results from germline and somatic mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene and is characterized by highly vascularized tumors. VHL mutations lead to stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which up-regulates proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This pathway is therefore believed to underlie the hypervascular phenotypes of the VHL tumors. However, recent studies have identified novel VHL functions that are independent of the HIF-VEGF pathway. In addition, a potential role of VHL in the tumor microenvironment, which carries heterozygous VHL mutations in VHL patients, has been overlooked. Here, we report a novel HIF-independent VHL function in the endothelium. VHL knockdown in primary human microvascular endothelial cells caused defective turnover of surface fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, and ETS1 activation, leading to increased cell motility in response to FGF and three-dimensional cord formation in vitro. HIF-alpha knockdown in VHL loss-of-function endothelial cells does not impede their elevated in vitro angiogenic activity. Importantly, the elevated angiogenic response to FGF is recapitulated in Vhl-heterozygous mice. Thus, partial loss of function of VHL in endothelium may be a contributing factor in tumor angiogenesis through a HIF-VEGF-independent mechanism.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2008-06-19", "authors": ["Kristen JChampion", "MariaGuinea", "VincentDammai", "TienHsu"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6003"}
{"title": "Tumor angiogenesis and progression are enhanced by Sema4D produced by tumor-associated macrophages.", "abstract": "Increased evidence suggests that cancer-associated inflammation supports tumor growth and progression. We have previously shown that semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), a ligand produced by different cell types, is a proangiogenic molecule that acts by binding to its receptor, plexin B1, expressed on endothelial cells (Conrotto, P., D. Valdembri, S. Corso, G. Serini, L. Tamagnone, P.M. Comoglio, F. Bussolino, and S. Giordano. 2005. Blood. 105:4321-4329). The present work highlights the role of Sema4D produced by the tumor microenvironment on neoplastic angiogenesis. We show that in an environment lacking Sema4D, the ability of cancer cells to generate tumor masses and metastases is severely impaired. This condition can be explained by a defective vascularization inside the tumor. We demonstrate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main cells producing Sema4D within the tumor stroma and that their ability to produce Sema4D is critical for tumor angiogenesis and vessel maturation.

Two articular radius fractures occurred during the harvesting of the graft. Five patients underwent a second intervention after this vascularized bone graft: four proximal row carpectomies and one conventional bone graft.

The volumes were analyzed and displayed by multiplanar and tomographic ultrasound imaging (TUI) modes and static volume contrast imaging (VCI). Color Doppler was added to the volumes acquired, and various rendering modes were used to display the volume datasets.\nThe mean gestational age at evaluation was 22 (range, 14-34) weeks.

The TUI mode achieved optimal display of the thorax, thereby aiding the diagnosis of diaphragmatic hernia and lung dysplasia. In right diaphragmatic hernias, the VCI mode proved invaluable as it distinguished liver from lung tissue. High-definition color Doppler with glass-body rendering significantly contributed to the detection of abnormal vascularization in lung dysplasia. Maximal transparent mode with a transvaginal transducer provided accurate diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia in the first trimester.

We reported the first clinical use of the lateral gastrocnemius perforating artery flap including a vascularized sural nerve in 2003. This flap was elevated based on a perforator arising from the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. However, we have since encountered vascular variations in these perforators. We subsequently developed a reliable technique for harvesting this flap in the course of treating 10 patients. Safe flap elevation from the lateral aspect of the posterior calf requires preservation of one of the superficial sural arteries until reliable perforators arising from gastrocnemius muscle lateral head are encountered during dissection. When such perforators are not observed, nutrient vessels such as superficial sural arteries or muscle perforators originating from vessels other than the lateral sural artery must be selected as a flap pedicle.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2008-06-13", "authors": ["KatsuhikoKashiwa", "SeiichiroKobayashi", "HisayukiTono", "KazuhitoOgino", "HiroakiKimura"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2008-1064930"}

Although the condition has been recognized for many years, the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. In turn, this results in inadequate treatment and high recurrence rates. Various theories try to explain the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. However, none of them can explain all disease locations and appearances, and it is unclear how these fragments establish into endometriotic lesions. New vessel formation has long been recognized as a feature of endometriosis, often clearly visible at laparoscopy. Recent work has focused on identifying the role of vascularization in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, by allowing lesions to establish and grow. In this review the authors outline the basic mechanisms of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the human eutopic endometrium, and consider how this data can be applied to endometriotic implants. Furthermore, the authors discuss molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and how this may be used to therapeutic advantage in the treatment of endometriosis.", "journal": "Minerva ginecologica", "date": "2008-06-13", "authors": ["KMay", "C MBecker"], "doi": null}

Forty-two patients were reconstructed by means of the free vascularized fibular flap with or without a skin paddle. Patients underwent resection for benign (n = 15) and malignant (n = 27) entities. Fourteen patients received preoperative radiotherapy and only 1 patient received preoperative chemotherapy. The donor site was closed primarily in 7 cases, whereas an abdominal full-thickness skin graft was used in 35 cases.\nThirty-eight patients were treated by means of an osteocutaneous flap, whereas only 4 developed an osseous flap. Five patients developed complications related to the vascular anastomosis and needed a second surgical look. One patient died in the immediate postoperative period. The skin island flap was completely viable in 37 cases (88%). Considering bone survival as the main objective, an overall flap survival rate of 92.85% was achieved in the whole series.

{"title": "The tumor microenvironment and metastatic disease.", "abstract": "The microenvironment of solid tumors is a heterogeneous, complex milieu for tumor growth and survival that includes features such as acidic pH, low nutrient levels, elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and chronic and fluctuating levels of oxygenation that relate to the abnormal vascular network that exists in tumors. The metastatic potential of tumor cells is believed to be regulated by interactions between the tumor cells and their extracellular environment (extracellular matrix (ECM)). These interactions can be modified by the accumulation of genetic changes and by the transient alterations in gene expression induced by the local tumor microenvironment. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that altered gene expression in response to the hypoxic microenvironment is a contributing factor to increased metastatic efficiency. A number of genes that have been implicated in the metastatic process, involving angiogenesis, intra/extravasation, survival and growth, have been found to be hypoxia-responsive. The various metastatic determinants, genetic and epigenetic, somatic and inherited may serve as precedents for the future identification of more genes that are involved in metastasis. Much research has focused on genetic and molecular properties of the tumor cells themselves. In the present review we discuss the epigenetic and physiological regulation of metastasis and emphasize the need for further studies on the interactions between the pathophysiologic tumor microenvironment and the tumor extracellular matrix.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2008-06-11", "authors": ["Sarah JaneLunt", "NazChaudary", "Richard PHill"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-008-9182-2"}

Cyclooxygenase-2 displays a proangiogenic activity in in vitro and in vivo models, mediated principally through its metabolite prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Here, we provide evidence for a novel signaling route through which PGE(2) activates the Alk5-Smad3 pathway in endothelial cells. PGE(2) induces Alk5-dependent Smad3 nuclear translocation and DNA binding, and the activation of this pathway involves the release of active TGFbeta from its latent form through a process mediated by the metalloproteinase MT1-MMP, whose membrane clustering is promoted by PGE(2). MT1-MMP-dependent transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling through Alk5 is also required for PGE(2)-induced endothelial cord formation in vitro, and Alk5 kinase activity is required for PGE(2)-induced neovascularization in vivo.

{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinase control of capillary morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play crucial roles in a variety of normal (e.g., blood vessel formation, bone development) and pathophysiological (e.g., wound healing, cancer) processes. This is not only due to their ability to degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), but also because MMPs function to reveal cryptic matrix binding sites, release matrix-bound growth factors inherent to these processes, and activate a variety of cell surface molecules. The process of blood vessel formation, in particular, is regulated by what is widely classified as the angiogenic switch: a mixture of both pro- and antiangiogenic factors that function to counteract each other unless the stimuli from one side exceeds the other to disrupt the quiescent state. Although it was initially thought that MMPs were strictly proangiogenic, new functions for this proteolytic family, such as mediating vascular regression and generating matrix fragments with antiangiogenic capacities, have been discovered in the last decade. These findings cast MMPs as multifaceted pro- and antiangiogenic effectors. The purpose of this review is to introduce the reader to the general structure and characterization of the MMP family and to discuss the temporal and spatial regulation of their gene expression and enzymatic activity in the following crucial steps associated with angiogenesis: degradation of the vascular basement membrane, proliferation and invasion of endothelial cells within the subjacent ECM, organization into immature tubules, maturation of these nascent vessels, and the pruning and regression of the vascular network.", "journal": "Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression", "date": "2008-06-11", "authors": ["Cyrus MGhajar", "Steven CGeorge", "Andrew JPutnam"], "doi": "10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v18.i3.30"}

The present study aims to evaluate the effects of nicotine on blood perfusion, angiogenesis and bone formation using a rabbit model of mandibular lengthening. Twenty adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to the control group and nicotine group. The total nicotine or placebo exposure time for all animals was 7 weeks. After 2- or 4-week of consolidation following osteotomy, 3-day of latency and 11-day of active distraction, the animals were sacrificed and the mandibles were harvested. Blood perfusion and vascularization were evaluated by Laser Doppler monitoring and Collagen IV immunohistochemistry staining respectively. Bone formation was assessed by radiological, histological and immunohistochemical examination. Results showed that nicotine exposure increased microvessel density, whereas inhibited blood flow and bone formation. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 in osteoblasts was also decreased. Frequent appearance of cartilage islands suggested ischemia and low oxygen tension in the distraction regenerate.

It is not a surprise that, as our knowledge is deepest in case of tumor-induced neoangiogenesis, the first successful antiangiogenic drugs have been developed in this area. As neoangiogenesis involves growth factor receptors, most of them tyrosine kinases (KIT, Flt-3, VEGFRs, PDGFR, TIE2, FGFR1, EGFR and MET), several of these novel agents are tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This review summarizes our recent knowledge on various forms of cancer vascularization, the molecular mechanisms behind, depicting the \"drugable\" targets.

Here we demonstrate that a delayed HO-1 transduction mediated by a recombinant adeno-associated virus in ischemic hearts of mice with permanent coronary artery ligation significantly attenuated left ventricular fibrosis and cardiac dysfunctions examined at 4 weeks post MI. HO-1-mediated protection was correlated with enhanced vascularization in the ischemic myocardium. HO-1 gene transfer resulted in a notable increase in the number of c-kit(+)- stem cells recruited to the infarcted area at 10 days after ligation. HO-1-mediated stem cell recruitment was also demonstrated in the heart of non-ischemic mice receiving intravenous infusion of green fluorescent protein-bearing bone marrow stem cells. Additional experiments revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) were highly induced in HO-1 transduced myocardium. Mononuclear cell infiltration was evident and colocalized with angiogenic factors in the same region. Flow cytometry analysis of the mononuclear cells isolated from HO-1-transduced left ventricles revealed that over 50% of cells expressed CD34, a marker of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells. VEGF and SDF-1 blockade by neutralizing antibodies significantly attenuated HO-1-mediated neovascularization and protection in infarcted mice.

{"title": "RIP2 is required for NOD signaling but not for Th1 cell differentiation and cellular allograft rejection.", "abstract": "Two previous reports that receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-2 knockout (RIP2-/-) mice had defective nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling and T helper (Th)1 immune responses had led us to believe that this putative serine-threonine kinase might be a possible target for transplant immunosuppression. Thus, we tested whether RIP2-/- mice were able to reject vascularized allografts. Surprisingly, we found that T cells from RIP2-/- mice proliferated and produced interferon (IFN)-gamma after allostimulation in vitro. Moreover, na\u00efve RIP2-/- CD4+ T cells differentiated normally into Th1 or Th2 cells under appropriate cytokine microenvironments. Consistent with these findings, no difference in allograft survival was observed between wild-type and RIP2-/- recipient mice, and rejection had similar pathology and cytokine profiles in both types of recipients. RIP2 deficiency was associated with defective NOD signaling, but this did not affect T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent activation of the canonical NF-kappaB signaling or expression of NF-kappaB genes in rejecting allografts. Our data demonstrate that RIP2-deficient mice have intact canonical NF-kappaB signaling and can mount Th1-mediated alloresponses and reject vascularized allografts as efficiently as wild-type mice, thus arguing against RIP2 as a primary target for immunosuppression.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2008-06-05", "authors": ["TFairhead", "DLian", "M LMcCully", "BGarcia", "RZhong", "JMadrenas"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02236.x"}

The scarcity of information about these membranes in egg-laying reptiles hampers attempts to distinguish specializations for viviparity from ancestral oviparous features. We used scanning electron microscopy to examine fetal membranes of an oviparous snake (Pituophis guttatus) throughout the developmental period from oviposition to hatching. The external surface of the chorion contains broad, flattened cells that lack surface features; these cells form a continuous layer over the allantoic capillaries and offer a minimal barrier to respiratory exchange. In contrast, the surface epithelium of the omphalopleure bears elaborate surface ridges suggestive of absorptive capabilities. These ridges are prominent in the first few weeks after oviposition, but diminish thereafter. During development, the isolated yolk mass (IYM) of the omphalopleure becomes depleted, and the tissue becomes heavily vascularized by allantoic vessels. Surface features of the omphalopleure progressively take on the appearance of the chorioallantois, but the changes are not synchronous with loss of the IYM or membrane vascularization. Previous studies on viviparous snakes suggest that the chorioallantois and omphalopleure are respectively specialized for gas exchange and absorption in the intrauterine environment. Our studies of fetal membranes in P. guttatus offer evidence that cytological specializations for these functions originated under oviparous conditions, reflecting functional capacities that predate viviparity.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2008-06-04", "authors": ["Siobhan MKnight", "Daniel GBlackburn"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10615"}

{"title": "Leukemia inhibitory factor regulates microvessel density by modulating oxygen-dependent VEGF expression in mice.", "abstract": "To meet tissue requirements for oxygen, capillaries must be properly distributed without excess or shortage. In this process, tissue oxygen concentration is well known to determine capillary density via the hypoxia-induced cascade, in which HIFs and VEGF play key roles. However, some additional mechanisms modulating this cascade are suggested to be involved in precise capillary network formation. Here, we showed that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was predominantly expressed in developing endothelium, while its receptor was expressed in surrounding cells such as retinal astrocytes. The retinas of Lif(-/-) mice displayed increased microvessel density accompanied by sustained tip cell activity, due to increased VEGF expression by astrocytes in the vascularized area. Lif(-/-) mice resisted hyperoxygen insult in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model, whereas they paradoxically had increased numbers of neovascular tufts. In an in vitro study, LIF inhibited hypoxia-induced VEGF expression and proliferation in cultured astrocytes. Lif(-/-) mice also exhibited similarly increased microvessel density and upregulated VEGF in various tissues outside the retina. Together, these findings suggest that tissues and advancing vasculature communicate to ensure adequate vascularization using LIF as well as oxygen, which suggests a new strategy for antiangiogenic therapy in human diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and cancer.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2008-06-04", "authors": ["YoshiakiKubota", "MasanoriHirashima", "KazuoKishi", "Colin LStewart", "ToshioSuda"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI34882\n10.1038/nature04478\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09241.x\n10.1242/dev.01732\n10.1083/jcb.200302047\n10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80244-5\n10.1038/332834a0\n10.1101/gad.242002\n10.1172/JCI25964\n10.1071/RD9890281\n10.1038/359076a0\n10.1038/labinvest.3700216\n10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00757-0\n10.1126/science.277.5323.242\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.15.1.797\n10.1074/jbc.M700534200\n10.1074/jbc.M611782200\n10.1016/0896-6273(95)90238-4\n10.1038/nm1095-1024"}

Dissections of 14 different facial sides of cadavers were done. Through investigating the arterial supply of the upper and lower lips, measurements were performed and statistically analyzed. The main arterial supply of the upper lip was from the superior labial artery (SLA, mean external diameter, 1.8 mm [SD, 0.74 mm]); in addition, the subalar and septal branches contributed to its vascularization. The origin of the SLA was above the labial commissure in 78.6%. The subalar branch was not found but replaced by the alar artery that arose from the infraorbital artery in 1 specimen. The main arterial supply of the lower lip was derived from 3 branches of the facial artery, the inferior labial artery (mean external diameters, 1.4 mm [SD, 0.31 mm]) and the horizontal and vertical labiomental arteries. The inferior labial artery originated mostly below the labial commissure in 42.9% and formed a common trunk with the SLA in 28.6%.

{"title": "Societal interactions in ovarian cancer metastasis: a quorum-sensing hypothesis.", "abstract": "The biochemical and biological mechanisms metastatic cancer cells use to function as communities and thwart internal and external growth control mechanisms remain undefined. In this work, we present the hypothesis that cancer cells may use a Quorum-Sensing mechanism to regulate multicellular functions and control steps in metastatic colonization. Quorum sensing is a bacterial cell-cell communication process used to track increasing cell-population density and, in response to changes in cell number, coordinate gene expression and behavior on a community-wide scale. Important parallels between the behavior of societies of bacterial cells and societies of malignant cancer cells exist in the bacterial literature. Of relevance to metastasis is the finding that pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing to determine when their population numbers are high enough to collectively form biofilms in or on host organisms. Biofilms are complex, heterogeneous communities of bacterial cells encased within an extracellular matrix attached to a solid surface. Biofilms exacerbate disease and are refractory to a battery of therapies. We suggest that the quorum-sensing-controlled bacterial biofilm formation process closely parallels the steps in metastatic colonization. Cells migrate toward/on target surfaces (organ-specific homing), show cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (tumor cell-stromal cell crosstalk), remain subclinical until they can mount an effective attack (dormancy), form complex structures with channels for nutrient flow (vascularized lesions), and contain resistant cells which can cause disease recurrence (persistors).

The study included 5 cases with bone sarcoma of the distal femur, 15 cases having bone sarcoma of proximal tibia and 10 cases having soft tissue sarcoma around the knee region and popliteal fossa. Routine preoperative staging studies were done for every patient and included local plain radiography, local MRI, isotopic bone scan and CT chest. Local MRA or angiography was done in selected cases. According to the Enneking staging system, 19 patients had stage IIB and 11 had stage IIA. Patients having bone sarcoma of the proximal tibia were subjected to wide resection, endoprosthetic reconstruction and reconstruction of the extensor mechanism by the medial gastrocnemius muscle flap. Patients having bone sarcoma of the distal femur were subjected to wide resection, endo prosthetic reconstruction and coverage of the prosthesis and rebalance of the patellar tendon by the medial gastrocnemius flap. Patients having soft tissue sarcoma were subjected to wide resection and soft tissue coverage with either medial or lateral myocutaneous gastrocnemius flap or muscle flap with grafting. Limb function was evaluated according to MSTS functional scores. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy was given according to nationally-agreed protocols.\nThere were 18 males and 12 females with a mean age of 29 years at the time of surgery (range 11-44 years). The mean follow-up period was 52 months (range 25-72 months). Resection with a negative bony and soft tissue margins could be achieved in all cases. A total of 30 flaps were used and included medial gastrocnemius muscle flaps in 21 cases (15 cases had proximal tibia endoprothesis, 5 cases had distal femur endoprothesis, 2 cases had soft tissue sarcoma infiltrating the chin of tibia), myocutaneous gastrocnemius flaps in 8 cases having soft tissue sarcoma (5 had medial head flap and 3 cases lateral head flap). Flap survival was 100&. The success rate of limb salvage was 96.6% with high score functional results according to MSTS functional scores. The area of the skin island harvested in cases of myocutaneous flaps ranged from 11 to 18cm in length and from 5 to 8cm in width and all these cases required grafting of the donor site. Complications included partial wound dehiscence in one case, revision of the prosthesis in one case, amputation due to local recurrence in one case and significant extension lag in 2 cases.\nThe unique vascularization of the gastrocnemius muscle (one pedicle to each head), the size of the muscle belly, the fact that it is situated in the dissection field and that its transfer does not affect the function of the spared limb too adversely, makes it particularly suitable for limb sparing procedures for sarcoma in the region of the knee and popliteal fossa. The medial head is the workhorse muscle flap for soft tissue coverage of knee endoprothesis and reconstruction of extensor mechanism. This decreases the rate of complications and improves the functional outcome.

There were 9 males and 7 females with a mean age of 13 years at time of surgery (range 11-23 years). Mean follow up period was 52 months (range 32 -110 months). Fixation was done by cast in 14 cases and by plate and screws in 2 patients. According to the Enneking staging system (1), 9 patients had stage IIB and 7 had stage IIA. Bony union and hypertrophy were assessed radio graphically on regular basis. Hypertrophy was estimated in a percentage. Functional limb results were also reported according to MSTS functional scores [2].\nThe mean length of bony gap bridged was 14 cm (range of 11.0-16.0 cm) and the mean length of fibula harvested was 15.5 cm (range 12-17 cm). Ninety seven percent of patients (15 cases) healed primarily at a mean time of 4.8 months (range 3.5-6 months). Hypertrophy was evident in all patients and ranged from 60 to 210% (mean 91% ). Increase in size of the hypertrophied fibula beyond the recipient bone was noticed in three cases (18.7% ) and we relate this to weight-bearing forces and not to the size of the recipient bone. The mean time of the fibula to double its size (10 cases) was 21 months (range 18-31 months). Young patients developed full hypertrophy earlier than older patients. Complication rate was low.

Success of BMSC-based therapies, however, relies on a number of methodological improvements, including the establishment of a vascular network providing nutrients and oxygen to the transplanted cells and ensuring their immediate survival and long-term functionality. We described a method to enhance the autocrine expression of angiogenic factors by BMSCs. For this purpose, human BMSCs were treated with desferrioxamine (DFX). No PDGF-BB, VEGF-R1 or -R2 mRNA expression was detected under any of the conditions tested. mRNA and protein expression levels of TGFbeta1 were similar in BMSCs, whether they were exposed to DFX (50 microM) or to control conditions under normoxia for 48 h. In comparison with the results obtained with control conditions under normoxia, exposure of BMSCs to DFX for 48 h resulted in upregulation of bFGF at the protein (26-fold) but not at the mRNA levels and VEGF at both the mRNA (1.5-fold) and protein levels (4.5-fold). In comparison with the results obtained with control conditions under hypoxia, DFX induced a 50% increase in VEGF secretion but led to the same level of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha protein expression (a transduction factor involved in angiogenic factor expression and known to be activated by DFX). Exposure of BMSCs to DFX resulted in oversecretion of angiogenic factors, suggesting that DFX-treated BMSCs could be used to supply angiogenic factors.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2008-05-31", "authors": ["EstherPotier", "ElisabethFerreira", "SylvianeDennler", "AlainMauviel", "KarimOudina", "DelphineLogeart-Avramoglou", "Herv\u00e9Petite"], "doi": "10.1002/term.92"}

Such risks as excessive immune responses associated with this virus administration in vivo however have limited its applicability in clinical settings as is the case with other viral vectors including adenoviruses. In consequence of extensive assessment on the mechanisms of immune responses against SeV, we found that ex vivo infection of immature dendritic cells (DCs) with SeV demonstrates their spontaneous maturation and activation. We applied this result to create a unique, representative, and powerful agent to activate DCs, namely rSeV-modified DCs (rSeV/DCs), for use in cancer immunotherapy. Use of this system in vivo resulted in the induction of efficient antitumor immunity against vascularized rodent tumors, including melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and prostatic cancer, and it even frequently associated with elimination of those tumors. These results indicate that rSeV could be a powerful immune booster for DC-based cancer immunotherapy that is worth investigating further.

Here we review the evidences indicating a role of the plasminogen activation system in the regulation of all the phases of the inflammation process. Plasminogen activation controls the formation of complement anaphylotoxins (responsible for vasodilatation, increase of venular permeability and leukocyte chemotaxis) and of bradykinin (which accounts for vasodilatation, increase of venular permeability and pain) by regulating the plasma contact system. The urokinase plasminogen activator and its cellular receptor, expressed on the surface of human leukocytes, provide a functional unit that, by regulating interaction of leukocytes with extracellular matrix, as well as its degradation, is critical for the migration of leukocytes and for their movement in the damaged tissues. By preventing excess fibrin accumulation in inflamed tissues, the plasminogen activation system also governs the proper evolution of the inflammatory exudates and prevents the possibility of a shift from acute to chronic inflammation.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library", "date": "2008-05-30", "authors": ["MarioDel Rosso", "GabriellaFibbi", "MarcoPucci", "FrancescaMargheri", "SimonaSerrati"], "doi": "10.2741/3032"}
{"title": "Biliary strictures following liver transplantation: past, present and preventive strategies.", "abstract": "Biliary complications are still the major source of morbidity for liver transplant recipients. The reported incidence of biliary strictures is 5%-15% after deceased donor liver transplantation and 28%-32% after right-lobe live donor surgery. Presentation is usually within the first year, but the incidence is known to increase with longer follow-up. The anastomotic variant is due to technical factors, whereas the nonanastomotic form is due to immunological and ischemic events, which later may lead to graft loss. Endoscopic management of anastomotic strictures achieves a success rate of 70%-100%; it drops to 50%-75% for nonanastomotic strictures with a higher recurrence rate. Results of endoscopic maneuvers are disappointing for biliary strictures after live donor liver transplantation, and the success rate is 60%-75% for anastomotic strictures and 25%-33% for the nonanastomotic variant. Preventive strategies in the cadaveric donor include the standardization of the type of anastomosis and maintenance of a vascularized ductal stump. In right-lobe live donor livers, donor liver duct harvesting also involves a major risk. The concept of high hilar intrahepatic Glissonian dissection, dissecting the artery and the duct as one unit, use of microsurgical techniques for smaller ducts, use of ductoplasty, and flexibility in the performance of double ductal anastomosis are the critical components of the preventive strategies in the recipient. In the case of live donors, judicious use of intraoperative cholangiograms, minimal dissection of the hilar plate, and perpendicular transection of the duct constitute the underlying principals for obtaining a vascularized duct.", "journal": "Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society", "date": "2008-05-30", "authors": ["SharadSharma", "AhmetGurakar", "NicolasJabbour"], "doi": "10.1002/lt.21509"}

However, at present, the general consensus is that only tumors with extracavernous extensions should be operated on and that resection is performed only on the extracavernous portions. Since these tumors are deep-seated and in the vicinity of vital and highly functional neurovascular structures, surgery remains difficult and dangerous. To achieve the gross total removal of the extracavernous extensions with minimal sequelae, the operative strategy must take into account the location of the tumor extension, not only in the basal cisterns but also into the skull base structures, the vascularization of the tumor with its feeders, as well as the venous drainage pathways. These anatomical and surgical data are collected from preoperative imaging, which includes CT-scan with bony windows and consecutive fine sections, MRI, angio-MR, and DSA angiography performed with selective arteriography including late venous phases. The operative plan must define the type of craniotomy and complementary osteotomy, the usefulness of an anterior clinoidectomy with skeletonization of the optic nerve, and determine whether extensive exposure of the cerebral middle fossa is necessary to ensure substantial devascularization of the tumor and proximal control of the internal carotid artery at its intrapetrosal portion.

In humans, placental insufficiency can result in intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal death and spontaneous abortion. We show that in C57BL/6J mice a null mutation in the gene encoding the transcriptional corepressor, Tgif, causes placental defects. The major defects are decreased vascularization of the placenta, due to a decrease in the fetal blood vessels, and decreased expression of the gap junction protein Gjb2 (Cx26). These defects result in severe growth retardation in a proportion of Tgif null embryos in Tgif heterozygous mothers, and an overall growth delay in Tgif null animals. Placental defects are much more severe if the mother also completely lacks Tgif function, and placentas from heterozygous Tgif embryos are defective in a Tgif null mother. Embryo transfer experiments show that even the placenta from a wild type embryo is compromised in the absence of maternal Tgif. These results demonstrate that Tgif functions in the normal development of the placenta, and suggest a role for maternal factors in regulating the morphogenesis of embryonically-derived placental tissues.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2008-05-30", "authors": ["LaurentBartholin", "Tiffany AMelhuish", "Shannon EPowers", "SophieGoddard-L\u00e9on", "IsabelleTreilleux", "Ann ESutherland", "DavidWotton"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.04.027"}

Semi-quantitative evaluation of the levels of bFGF, HDAC1 and HIF-1alpha by Western blot analysis showed a decrease in expression only in the tumors of mice treated with AN-7. The level of bFGF was reduced 3-fold in the tumor and that of TIMP1 was elevated (by 3-fold) in the serum of AN-7 treated mice. In a 4T1 metastatic breast carcinoma model, AN-7 inhibited the formation of lung lesions by 76% and AN-9 by 47%, further demonstrating the greater efficacy of AN-7 compared to AN-9 (P<0.02).

{"title": "Acid sphingomyelinase involvement in tumor necrosis factor alpha-regulated vascular and steroid disruption during luteolysis in vivo.", "abstract": "TNF is well known for its role in inflammation, including direct effects on the vasculature. TNF also is implicated in the regulation of reproduction by its actions to affect ovarian steroidogenic cells and to induce apoptosis of corpus luteum (CL)-derived endothelial cells in vitro. We hypothesized that the disruption of TNF signaling would postpone the regression of the highly vascularized CL in vivo, and this effect could be replicated in mutant mouse models lacking TNF receptor (TNFRI(-/-)) and/or a critical enzyme of TNF signaling, acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase(-/-)). In the current study, the treatment of pseudopregnant mice with the luteolytic mediator prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF) significantly increased TNF in the ovaries when compared with saline-treated controls. Treatment with PGF also reduced serum progesterone (P4) concentrations and caused involution of the CL. However, pretreatment of pseudopregnant mice with Etanercept (ETA), a TNF-neutralizing antibody, inhibited the PGF-induced decrease in P4 and delayed luteal regression. A similar outcome was evident in pseudopregnant TNFRI(-/-) animals. Treatment of luteal microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) with TNF provoked a significant increase in ASMase activity when compared with the corresponding controls. Furthermore, TNF-induced MVEC death was inhibited in the ASMase(-/-) mice. The ASMase(-/-) mice displayed no obvious evidence of luteal regression 24 h after treatment with PGF and were resistant to the PGF-induced decrease in P4. Together these data provide evidence that TNF plays an active role in luteolysis.

A prerequisite for successful application of bioartificial liver tissue is sufficient initial vascularization. In this study, we evaluated the transplantation of fibrin gel-immobilized FLC in a vascularized arterio-veno-venous (AV)-loop model. FLC were isolated from embryonic/foetal (ED 16) rat livers and were enriched by using magnetic cell sorting (MACS). After cryopreservation, FLC were labelled by pkh-26. Cells were transplanted in a fibrin matrix into a subcutaneous chamber containing a microsurgically created AV-loop in the femoral region of the recipient rat. The chambers were explanted after 14 days. Subcutaneous implants without an AV-loop and cell-free implants served as controls. Fluorescence microscopy of the constructs was used to identify pkh-26(+)- donor cells. Characterization was performed by RT-PCR and immunhistology (IH) for CK-18 and CD31. Transplantation of FLC using the AV-loop permitted a neo-tissue formation in the fibrin matrix. A high-density vascularization was observed in the AV-loop constructs as shown by CD31 IH. Viable foetal donor cells were detected which expressed CK-18. FLC can be successfully used for heterotopic transplantation. Fibrin matrix permits rapid blood vessel ingrowth from the AV-loop and supports engraftment of FLC. It is therefore an appropriate environment for hepatocyte transplantation in combination with microsurgical vascularization strategies.

This technique gained a widespread acceptance in many countries of the world. The Centre of Cardiac Surgery of the University of Debrecen was the first to apply this treatment in Hungary. The authors evaluated the VAC therapy in a retrospective study at their institute. Between September 2002 and December 2005 62 consecutive patients were treated with this method because of wound infection in median sternotomy. Median age of 42 males and 20 females was 63,1 +/- 6,8 years (42-75). All patients had heart surgery (cardio pulmonary bypass) before they developed superficial or deep wound infection in their sternotomy site. Following exploration and radical debridement of the sternotomy wounds, VAC method was used for the treatment of infected wounds until suppuration stopped. When the wound had become macroscopically clear, reconstruction of the sternal defect was performed. This was carried out with well vascularized soft tissue flap(s) (major pectoral muscle and/or omental or pericardial fat pad) in 34 patients, sternal refixation was performed in 13 cases, while 11 patients underwent delayed secondary wound reconstruction with sutures. In one case Ley-prosthesis (sternal stabilisator metal prosthesis) was implanted. Three patients died before the sternal wound reconstruction. As a result of VAC therapy, all infected mediastinal wound cleaned up rapidly and formation of granulation tissue began. The mean period of time from the first sign of the infection to hospital discharge of the patients was 42.2 +/- 18.5 (5-185) days, while the same between sternal reconstruction and discharge was 19.9 +/- 9.6 (1-63) days. The mean duration of VAC therapy was 7.9 +/- 3.4 (1-21) days. The hospital mortality was 11.3% (7/62). Recurrence of the infection occurred in two patients (3.6%).

In addition, all the longitudinal sections of the 5 normal nail unit specimens, used in the 2 previous studies, were reviewed to analyze the ventral surface of the nail plate in longitudinal planes. The nail isthmus can be described synthetically by 2 features: (1) a stair-like appearance of the epithelium of the distal nail bed with a marked depression of the epithelium below the inferior surface of the nail plate (2) a specialized mode of attachment of its horny layer to nail plate via a horizontal mode of differentiation. The white band of Pinkus corresponded histologically to the nail isthmus. Its white color was caused by alteration in light diffraction in the thin compartment of pale parakeratotic corneocytes squeezed between the nail plate and the epithelium of the nail isthmus. The pink middle band corresponded to the 2 horny layers surmounting the epidermis of the hyponychium: the compact horny layer of the hyponychium and the thin pale \"tongue-like\" parakeratotic extension of the nail isthmus. The variable thinness of both the suprapapillary plates of hyponychium and the 2 horny layers surmounting this area explained the variable visibility of the well-developed vascular network of the dermal papillae of hyponychium, that is, the variegation of the middle subband. The review of all step sections of the normal distal nail unit cut longitudinally showed that the ventral surface of the nail plate was slightly serrated in longitudinal planes. The nail isthmus belongs functionally to the nail bed. The strong adherence between the nail plate and the nail bed is replaced by an effective sealing between the thin pale tongue-like parakeratotic extension of the nail isthmus and the nail plate. In contrast, the hyponychium belongs functionally to fingertip and exhibits an epidermal-type horny layer, that is, the horny layer of the distal hyponychium is a supportive structure. As the ventral surface of the nail plate is undulated in its transversal and to a lesser extend in its longitudinal axis, the nail bed and the nail plate grow forward together. The nail plate is \"pushed\" out by 2 factors: (1) the matrix which makes a new plate, (2) the nail bed which moves slowly, parallel to the direction of the nail growth, toward the tiny grooves and ridges of the inferior border of the nail plate. According to the anatomo-clinical description of the distal nail unit, the nomenclature of this region could be simplified. The term nail isthmus should be proposed as equivalent of the white band of Pinkus. The hyponychium could be compared with the follicular infundibulum as a zone bordering the surrounding epidermis, and the term nail infundibulum could be considered to be synonymous for hyponychium and ODB.", "journal": "The American Journal of dermatopathology", "date": "2008-05-23", "authors": ["ChristophePerrin"], "doi": "10.1097/DAD.0b013e31816a9d31"}

In congenital hypothyroidism (CH), thyroid imaging permits a precise characterization of the aetiology, which is important for genetic counselling and clinical management. CH may be due to thyroid dysgenesis (ectopia, hypoplasia and athyrosis) or occurs in eutopic glands. In the latter, hypothyroidism may be either transient, especially after iodine overload, or due to permanent autosomal recessive dyshormonogenesis. Thyroid scintigraphy (TS) with either 99mTcO4 or 123I will identify ectopic thyroid tissue, which is the commonest cause of CH. However, recent reports favour the use of 123I, which enhances the accuracy of the aetiological classification. In cases of eutopic thyroid, the measurement of 123I uptake before and after perchlorate administration evaluates the organification process. At all ages, colour Doppler ultrasound scanning (CDU) is helpful in assessing thyroid volume, in identifying nodules and in characterizing tissue vascularization. TS and CDU images of most paediatric thyroid dysfunctions are presented.", "journal": "Hormone research", "date": "2008-05-22", "authors": ["JClerc", "HMonpeyssen", "AChevalier", "FAmegassi", "DRodrigue", "F ALeger", "BRichard"], "doi": "10.1159/000129672"}

Mutational activation of protein kinases and loss of cell adhesion occur together in human lung adenocarcinoma but how these two pathways interconnect is only poorly understood. Mouse models of human lung adenocarcinoma with oncogene expression targeted to subtypes of lung epithelial cells led to formation of adenomas or adenocarcinomas that lacked metastatic potential. Conditional genetic abrogation of epithelial tumour cell adhesion in mice with benign lung tumours induced by oncogenic RAF kinase has been demonstrated to induce intratumourous vascularization (angiogenic switch), progression to invasive adenocarcinoma and micrometastasis. Importantly, breaking cell adhesion in benign oncogene-driven lung tumour cells activated beta-catenin signalling and induced the expression of several genes that are normally expressed in intestine rather than the lung.

{"title": "Contributions to the study of oviparity-viviparity transition: placentary structures of Liolaemus elongatus (Squamata: Liolaemidae).", "abstract": "Liolaemus elongatus (Liolaemidae) is a viviparous, mainly lecithotrophic species with placental structures specialized for uptake of oxygen and inorganic nutrient transport. An allantoplacenta and an omphaloplacenta are present during early embryonic stages (25-28) and there is a moderate distension of the uterine wall and major glandular activity in the uterine mucosa and submucosa compared with nonpregnant females. The uterine epithelium increases in height, first as a growth in the height of some dispersed cells localized in all regions of the placenta, and later as groups of cells localized in the periembryonic and central-abembryonic regions. At embryonic stage 39, the allantoplacenta reaches its maximum extension around the yolk sac. Omphaloplacenta is restricted to the abembryonic zone, the yolk cleft limiting the newly formed isolated vitelline mass. At more advanced embryonic stages (39-42), the blood supply to the allantoplacenta's periembryonic zone increases, matching the profuse allantoic vascularization. At embryonic stage 42, a secondary cleft opens in the main vitelline mass, above the first yolk cleft, and allantoic blood vessels enter into this secondary cleft. This secondary cleft subdivides the vitelline mass into a large embryonic region connected to a much smaller abembryonic region. In L. elongatus most nutritional resources seem to be provided by the yolk that remains attached to the newborn for 2 or 3 days as an external supply. The embryo's wet weight doubles the weight of the decrease observed in vitelline mass. But the dry wet diminishes, evidencing the importance of the exchange of water and inorganic nutrients.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2008-05-21", "authors": ["MelisaCrocco", "Nora RIbarguengoyt\u00eda", "V\u00edctorCussac"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10632"}

{"title": "Schwann cell precursors transplanted into the injured spinal cord multiply, integrate and are permissive for axon growth.", "abstract": "There is a strong current interest in the use of cell transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injuries. We report here the novel and potentially useful properties of an early cell in the Schwann cell lineage, the Schwann cell precursor (SCP). The experiments reveal a striking difference between these cells and Schwann cells when transplanted into the CNS. Unlike Schwann cells, SCPs thrive in the CNS where they initially proliferate rapidly but then fall out of division, thus effectively filling up the large cystic cavities formed following crush injury, while avoiding tumor formation. By 8 weeks, SCPs had started to express S100beta protein, a marker that differentiates Schwann cells from SCPs and had formed an apparently stable, vascularized cell mass, which created a continuous cellular bridge across the cystic cavities. The formation of the surrounding glial scar was reduced by local spread of the transplanted cells into the surrounding CNS tissue, where the cells integrated intimately with astrocytes and attenuated the physical barrier they normally form. SCP transplantation also altered and reduced the expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans around the injury site. Caudal to the SCP transplants there was a large increase in the number of axons, compared with that seen in nontransplanted control tissue, showing that the implants effectively support axonal growth or sprouting.

Indications for flap reconstruction included abdominal perineal resection for anal/rectal cancer, pelvic sarcoma/sacral resection/exenteration, small bowel/colonic fistula resection, and total proctocolectomy with vaginal reconstruction. Median follow-up was 17 (range, 1-57) months. Complications included epidermal necrosis at the flap tip (n = 2), delayed perineal wound breakdown (n = 1), one abdominal wound infection, one small abdominal dehiscence, and four pelvic abscesses all managed nonoperatively.

{"title": "Endogenous hedgehog expression contributes to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury.", "abstract": "The developmentally important hedgehog (Hh) pathway is activated in ischemic tissue, and exogenously administered Sonic hedgehog (Shh) supports tissue repair after cardiac ischemia. Hence, it is currently assumed that the endogenous increase in Shh during ischemia serves a beneficial role in limiting cardiac tissue damage. To prove or refute this hypothesis, we treated mice with the smoothened (Smo) inhibitor cyclopamine to block the Hh pathway during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The experimental induction of myocardial ischemia resulted in activation of the Hh pathway and hallmark features of myocardial damage, such as left ventricular dilatation and reduced cardiac output. Unexpectedly, cyclopamine treatment ameliorated left ventricular dilatation and cardiac output. As the beneficial effect of exogenous Shh was suggested to depend on reduced apoptosis, increased vascularization, and reduced fibrosis, we subsequently assessed the effect of cyclopamine on these processes. Vascularization was similar in cyclopamine-treated and control-treated animals, but increased apoptosis and reduced fibrosis were observed in the cyclopamine-treated animals. Thus, Hh seems to exert a dualistic action in cardiac ischemia in which high exogenous levels are able to foster tissue repair and endogenous Hh seems to be deleterious.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2008-05-16", "authors": ["Maarten FBijlsma", "Peter J ALeenders", "Ben J AJanssen", "Maikel PPeppelenbosch", "HugoTen Cate", "C ArnoldSpek"], "doi": "10.3181/0711-RM-307"}

However, it has been difficult to assess endothelial interactions during epithelial morphogenesis of internal organs. To address this issue we have developed the first time-lapse system to study vascularization of a mammalian organ in four dimensions. We show that vascularization of XX and XY gonads is a highly dynamic, sexually dimorphic process. The XX gonad recruits vasculature by a typical angiogenic process. In contrast, the XY gonad recruits and patterns vasculature by a novel remodeling mechanism beginning with breakdown of an existing mesonephric vessel. Subsequently, in XY organs individual endothelial cells migrate and reaggregate in the coelomic domain to form the major testicular artery. Migrating endothelial cells respect domain boundaries well before they are morphologically evident, subdividing the gonad into 10 avascular regions where testis cords form.

Protocadherin 12 (Pcdh12) is expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells, mesangial cells of kidney glomeruli, and glycogen cells of the mouse placenta. To get insight into the role of this protein in vivo, we analyzed PCDH12-deficient mice and investigated their placental phenotype. The mice were alive and fertile; however, placental and embryonic sizes were reduced compared with wild-type mice. We observed defects in placental layer segregation and a decreased vascularization of the labyrinth associated with a reduction in cell density in this layer. To understand the molecular events responsible for the phenotypic alterations observed in Pcdh12(-/-) placentas, we analyzed the expression profile of embryonic day 12.5 mutant placentas compared with wild-type placentas, using pangenomic chips: 2,289 genes exhibited statistically significant changes in expressed levels due to loss of PCDH12. Functional grouping of modified genes was obtained by GoMiner software. Gene clusters that contained most of the differentially expressed genes were those involved in tissue morphogenesis and development, angiogenesis, cell-matrix adhesion and migration, immune response, and chromatin remodeling. Our data show that loss of PCDH12 leads to morphological alterations of the placenta and to notable changes in its gene expression profile.

In the stomach, the effect of this preconditioning (the delay phenomenon) has helped to improve gastric vascularization prior to esophagogastric anastomosis after esophagectomy. Here we present a sequential study of the histological recovery of the gastric fundus and the phenomena of apoptosis, necrosis and neovascularization in an experimental model of partial gastric ischemia. Partial gastric devascularization was performed by ligature of the left gastric vessels in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were assigned to groups in accordance with their evaluation period: control, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 and 21 days. Histological analysis, caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation and vascular endothelial cell proliferation (Ki-67) were measured in tissue samples after sacrifice. After 24 h of partial gastric ischemia, rates of apoptosis and necrosis were higher in the experimental groups than in controls. Tissue injury was higher 3 and 6 days post-ischemia. From day 10 after partial gastric ischemia, apoptosis and necrosis started to decrease, and on days 15 and 21 showed no differences in relation to controls. Neovascularization began between days 1 and 3, reaching its peak at 15 days after ischemia and coinciding with complete histological recovery. Both necrosis and apoptosis play a role in tissue injury during the first days after partial gastric ischemia. After 15 days, the evolution of both the histology and the neovascularization suggested that this is the optimal time for performing gastric transposition.", "journal": "Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus", "date": "2008-05-15", "authors": ["SLamas", "DAzuara", "Jde Oca", "MSans", "LFarran", "EAlba", "EEscalante", "ARafecas"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1442-2050.2007.00772.x"}

Extracellular matrix proteins were evaluated in samples from six secretory meningiomas using a semiquantitative scale ranging from not detected (0) to marked (3).

Fibronectin expression was absent in two cases, minimal in two, moderate in one and marked with generalized distribution in the remaining case. Type IV collagen expression was minimal in three cases, moderate in two and marked with generalized distribution in the remaining case.

{"title": "Effect of age on vascularization during fracture repair.", "abstract": "Age affects fracture repair; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The goal of this study was to assess the effects that age has on vascularization during fracture healing. Tibial fractures were created in juvenile (4-week-old), middle-aged (6-month-old), and elderly (18-month-old) mice. The length density and surface density of blood vessels within fracture calluses were analyzed using stereology at 7 days after fracture. The expression of molecules that regulate vascular invasion of the fracture callus was also compared among the three age groups by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. At 7 days after fracture, juvenile mice had a higher surface density of blood vessels compared to the middle-aged and elderly. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha protein and transcripts of vascular endothelial growth factor were detected at 3 days postinjury in juvenile but not middle-aged and elderly mice. Stronger Mmp-9 and -13 expression was detected in fracture calluses at day 7 in the juvenile compared to the middle-aged and elderly mice. At 21 days postfracture, expression of both Mmps was more robust in the elderly than juvenile and middle-aged animals. These data indicate that age affects vascularization during fracture repair, and the changes we observed are directly correlated with altered expression of biochemical factors that regulate the process of angiogenesis. However, whether the increased vascularization is the cause or result of accelerated bone repair in juvenile animals remains unknown. Nonetheless, our results indicate that enhancing vascularization during fracture repair in the elderly may provide unique therapeutic opportunities.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society", "date": "2008-05-09", "authors": ["ChuanyongLu", "ErikHansen", "AnnaSapozhnikova", "DianeHu", "TheodoreMiclau", "Ralph SMarcucio"], "doi": "10.1002/jor.20667"}

The lower the birth weight of a premature infant, the higher the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) due to the disproportion between the regression of vasa hyaloidea (hyaloideoretinal adherences) and the proliferation of retinal vessels. This may be caused by an enhanced growth of retinal vessels (or a delayed regression of vasa hyaloidea). The growth of retinal vessels stops at a barrier formed by the retina-attaching hyaloidal remnants (vessels), resulting in a demarcation line and ROP. The same retinal vessels may then, as a fibrovascular tissue, overgrow the remnants of retina-attaching hyaloidal structures (as guiding formations) through the vitreous cavity up to the tunica vasculosa lentis.

{"title": "Endothelial cell-matrix interactions in neovascularization.", "abstract": "The success of many therapies in regenerative medicine requires the ability to control the formation of stable vascular networks within tissues. The formation of new blood vessels, or neovascularization, is mediated, in part, by interactions between endothelial cells (ECs) and insoluble factors in the extracellular microenvironment. These interactions are determined by the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the matrix. Understanding how extracellular matrices (ECMs) and synthetic scaffolds influence neovascularization can contribute to the fundamental knowledge of normal and diseased tissue physiology and can be used to guide the design of new therapies. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the complex role EC-matrix interactions play in neovascularization. A particular emphasis is placed on presenting differences in two subsets of ECM, basement membranes and stromal matrices, and identification of the properties of these matrices that define their biological functions. Attempts to apply information about EC-ECM interactions to enhance vascularization of synthetic materials are presented, and areas in need of further research are identified throughout this review. Our understanding of the role EC-matrix interactions play in neovascularization remains limited, but continued progress in this area could be of significant benefit to the design of clinically applicable engineered tissues.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Preservation of contour in periorbital and midfacial craniofacial microsurgery: reconstruction of the soft-tissue elements and skeletal buttresses.", "abstract": "Microsurgical reconstructive algorithms for craniofacial defects have focused on soft-tissue flaps with or without conventional bone grafts. However, volumetric loss from muscle atrophy, bone resorption, and soft-tissue contraction limits long-term preservation of facial contour. Applying craniofacial principles of skeletal buttress support, the authors used composite vascularized bone flaps to reconstruct the soft tissue and the vertical and horizontal buttresses of the face. In this manner, facial proportions and aesthetics are maintained in composite tissue defects resulting from high-energy trauma or oncologic extirpation.\nThe authors conducted a retrospective review of 31 patients with craniofacial defects treated by a single surgeon with composite bone flaps at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center and The Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2001 to 2006. Charts were reviewed and data were collected on age, sex, mechanism of injury, type of defect, type of reconstructive procedure, and outcome.\nThirty-one patients with composite tissue loss, primarily men (n = 21) with an average age of 37.4 years, underwent reconstruction with vascularized bone flaps (25 fibula flaps and six iliac crest flaps). There were three cranial defects, eight periorbital defects, 17 maxillary defects, and three maxillary and periorbital defects. The flap survival rate was 93.5 percent, with an average follow-up of 13.5 months.\nRestoration of facial height, width, and projection through skeletal buttress replacement is essential for achieving facial harmony. Since 2001, the authors' unit has pursued a paradigm shift with regard to treatment of composite oncologic or traumatic defects, advocating vascularized bone flaps to achieve excellent long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2008-05-06", "authors": ["Eduardo DRodriguez", "RachelBluebond-Langner", "Julie EPark", "Paul NManson"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e31816b13e1"}
{"title": "A systematic review of outcomes and complications of vascularized toe joint transfer, silicone arthroplasty, and PyroCarbon arthroplasty for posttraumatic joint reconstruction of the finger.", "abstract": "Posttraumatic conditions of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints require arthroplasty or fusion for pain control and functional improvement. Arthroplasty is increasingly becoming a preferred option for maintaining joint motion. However, a formal systematic review comparing the three currently available techniques-vascularized toe joint transfer, silicone, and PyroCarbon arthroplasty-has not been performed to critically evaluate outcomes and complication rates for these three options.\nThe authors used a formal systematic review of all available world literature (English and non-English). Data collection included active arc of motion as the primary outcome, and complication rates.\nFive hundred twenty articles were identified, reviewed, and screened through multiple inclusion/exclusion criteria. The mean proximal interphalangeal active arcs of motion for vascularized toe joint, silicone, and PyroCarbon were 37 +/- 9 degrees, 44 +/- 11 degrees, and 43 +/- 11 degrees, respectively. The mean metacarpophalangeal active arcs of motion for vascularized toe joint and silicone were 34 +/- 10 degrees and 47 +/- 16 degrees, respectively. Major complication rates requiring joint revision procedures for vascularized toe joint, silicone, and PyroCarbon were 29, 18, and 33 percent, respectively.\nVascularized toe joint transfer has a worse active arc of motion and a higher complication rate when compared with silicone implant arthroplasty for both proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. Early data suggest that PyroCarbon implants may be associated with higher rates of major complications. Given the lack of improvement in outcomes for posttraumatic finger joint reconstruction over the past 40 years, research efforts should focus on future development of novel arthroplasty devices.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2008-05-06", "authors": ["LeeSquitieri", "Kevin CChung"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e31816aa0b3"}
{"title": "Extended applications of vascularized preauricular and helical rim flaps in reconstruction of nasal defects.", "abstract": "Composite auricular chondrocutaneous grafting is a well-established technique for reconstructing alar defects. It can provide excellent results because it matches nasal tissue well in terms of color, texture, and contour. However, the size of composite graft that can be transferred is limited by its lack of blood supply. The authors reviewed their experience with the free vascularized preauricular and helical rim flaps for use in the reconstruction of large, full-thickness, nasal subunit defects.\nThe vascularized preauricular and helical rim flap is based on the superficial temporal vessels. Depending on the nature and size of the nasal defect, the crus helicis, helical rim, preauricular skin, superficial temporal fascia, and temporal bone can be harvested. In addition, a posterior auricular flap is designed to reconstruct the donor site. The authors performed a retrospective review of 63 clinical cases.\nAll 63 patients had full-thickness nasal defects that were reconstructed using this technique between 2001 and 2006. There were 36 unilateral alar defects, 20 alar and sidewall defects, three tip and columellar defects, and one patient with an entire lower third of the nose missing. Another three patients had large composite defects involving the nose and maxilla. The lateral femoral circumflex vessels were used as interpositional vascular grafts in most cases. Flap survival occurred in 61 of 63 cases (rate 97 percent). The functional and aesthetic outcome was satisfactory in the majority of patients.\nThe free vascularized preauricular and helical rim flap is a reliable method of reconstructing nasal defects and has wide clinical applications.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2008-05-06", "authors": ["Yi XinZhang", "JunYang", "DanruWang", "Yee SianOng", "Keith EFollmar", "YuguangZhang", "DetlevErdmann", "Michael RZenn", "YunliangQian", "L ScottLevin"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e31816a8d83"}
{"title": "Follicular fluid VEGF levels directly correlate with perifollicular blood flow in normoresponder patients undergoing IVF.", "abstract": "It has become increasingly clear that the follicular microenvironment of the maturing human oocyte is a determining factor for the implantation potential of an embryo deriving from that oocyte. Indeed the quality and maturity of an oocyte are influenced by the level of intrafollicular oxygen content which, in turn, is proportional to the degree of follicular vascularity. The aim of the study was to establish whether there is a relationship between follicular fluid VEGF concentrations, perifollicular vascularity and reproductive outcome in normal responders under the age of 35 undergoing IVF.\nSixty-one consecutive patients, all at their first IVF cycle, were included in the study. All patients had primary infertility due to male factor or tubal factor. At oocyte retrieval, the perifollicular vascularity of two follicles per ovary was estimated qualitatively through power Doppler blood flow, for a total of two hundred forty-four follicles. The follicular fluid from the identified follicles was centrifuged and stored until VEGF assay. The maturity and fertilization rate of the corresponding oocytes as well as embryo quality and pregnancy rate were recorded.\nIn our study, we found VEGF levels to be significantly correlated with grade of perifollicular vascularity. Oocytes obtained from follicles with the higher grade of vascularization also showed a higher rate of fertilization, embryos, a better quality and higher pregnancy rates were obtained in women with highly vascularized follicles. Perifollicular blood flow doppler indices seem to predict oocyte viability and quality. Moreover, VEGF may play a potential role in the development of the perifollicular capillary network.\nThe ability of a given follicle to express VEGF and develop an adequate vascular network may be inter-related in patients under the age of 35. An adequate blood supply may be fundamental important in the regulation of intrafollicular oxygen levels and the determination of oocyte quality.", "journal": "Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics", "date": "2008-05-02", "authors": ["PatriziaMonteleone", "PaoloGiovanni Artini", "GiovannaSimi", "ElenaCasarosa", "VitoCela", "Andrea RGenazzani"], "doi": "10.1007/s10815-008-9218-1\n10.1093/humrep/12.5.1047\n10.1016/1071-5576(95)00041-0\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.05.059\n10.1210/jc.81.1.353\n10.1093/humrep/13.12.3310\n10.1095/biolreprod65.4.1014\n10.1046/j.1365-2613.2002.00277.x\n10.1080/09513590600906607\n10.1016/S0015-0282(97)00278-1\n10.1093/humrep/12.1.191\n10.1093/humrep/14.4.939\n10.1196/annals.1335.016\n10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00683-9"}
{"title": "Effectiveness of radiotherapy in myxoid sarcomas is associated with a dense vascular pattern.", "abstract": "Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) have long been the standard treatment for most deep-seated sarcomas; however, since the randomized trial from the National Cancer Institute of Canada, which described similar local control for pre- vs. postoperative RT, both modalities are now widely accepted. As a group, sarcomas are classified as radiation resistant. The subgroup of myxoid liposarcoma (MLS), a sarcoma with a typical vascular crow's feet pattern, is highly radiosensitive, but a mechanism for this phenomenon is unknown. Here we describe our results with preoperative RT and propose a mechanism explaining the high sensitivity based on the distinctive vascularization pattern of MLS.\nBetween 2002 and 2006, 31 sarcoma patients, including 10 with MLS, underwent preoperative RT at our institute. Resected specimens were histologically evaluated, focusing on classification, grade, and vascularization patterns.\nTwenty sarcomas showed more than 80% pathologic response after preoperative RT. A pathologic complete response was found in all \"pure\" MLS specimens after preoperative RT (n = 8). There were no pathologic complete responses in the remaining sarcoma patients (n = 23), although 12 showed 80% to 90% pathologic response. In contrast to the remaining RT-resistant sarcomas, the highly responding specimens contained branching vasculature, partial thrombus formation and inflammation of medium sized arterioles, similar to the vascular changes in MLS.\nBoth MLS and sarcomas with MLS-like vasculature are highly radiosensitive. Radiation sensitivity may be explained by changes in medium-sized arterioles, obstructing the specific crow's feet vascularization and inducing hypoxia with secondary tumor cell death.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2008-05-02", "authors": ["Ronald S Ade Vreeze", "Daphnede Jong", "Rick LHaas", "FionaStewart", "Fritsvan Coevorden"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.03.008"}

Spondylitis was accompanied by severe instability of the lumbosacral area, a large lumbosacral ulcer, and a large bone and muscle defect, which made it difficult for the patient to maintain a sitting position. A total leg flap procedure, a modification of the total thigh flap procedure, was performed as a 1-stage salvage surgery. The vascularized tibia and fibula were grafted between the lumbar and sacral vertebrae, and a musculocutaneous flap was used to cover the extensive ulceration in the lumbosacral skin defect. The intractable lesion of the lumbosacral spine, which had not been cured for more than 2 years despite repeated debridement, intravenous antibiotic injections, sugar treatment, pyoktanin treatment, and hyperbaric O(2) treatment, subsided and stabilized within 1 year of surgery. The patient returned to activities of daily living using a wheelchair, and was very satisfied with the results.

Early engraftment of donor BMC [BN(RT1(n))] into the recipient BM compartment [LEW(RT1(l))] was achieved at 1 week posttransplant and this was associated with active hematopoiesis within allografted bone and correlated with high chimerism in the hematolymphoid organs. Two-way trafficking between donor and recipient BM compartments was confirmed by the presence of recipient MHC class I cells (RT1(l)) within the allografted bone up to 3 weeks posttransplant. At 10 weeks posttransplant, decline of BMC viability in allografted bone corresponded with bone fibrosis and lack of hematopoiesis. In contrast, active hematopoiesis was present in the recipient bone as evidenced by the presence of donor-specific immature (CD90/RT1(n)) cells, which correlated with chimerism maintenance. Clonogenic activity of donor-origin cells (RT1(n)) engrafted into the host BM compartment was confirmed by colony-forming units (CFU) assay. These results confirm that hematolymphoid chimerism is developed early post-VBMT by T-cell lineage and despite allografted bone fibrosis chimerism maintenance is supported by B-cell linage and active hematopoiesis of donor-origin cells in the host BM compartment.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2008-05-01", "authors": ["MSiemionow", "AKlimczak", "SUnal", "GAgaoglu", "KCarnevale"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02241.x"}

{"title": "Vascular tube formation on matrix metalloproteinase-1-damaged collagen.", "abstract": "Connective tissue damage and angiogenesis are both important features of tumour growth and invasion. Here, we show that endothelial cells maintained on a three-dimensional lattice of intact polymerised collagen formed a monolayer of cells with a cobblestone morphology. When the collagen was exposed to organ culture fluid from human basal cell tumours of the skin (containing a high level of active matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)), degradation of the collagen matrix occurred. The major degradation products were the $3 over 4$- and $1 over 4$-sized fragments known to result from the action of MMP-1 on type I collagen. When endothelial cells were maintained on the partially degraded collagen, the cells organised into a network of vascular tubes. Pretreatment of the organ culture fluid with either tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) or neutralising antibody to MMP-1 prevented degradation of the collagen lattice and concomitantly inhibited endothelial cell organisation into the vascular network. Purified (activated) MMP-1 duplicated the effects of skin organ culture fluid, but other enzymes including MMP-9 (gelatinase B), elastase or trypsin failed to produce measurable fragments from intact collagen and also failed to promote vascular tube formation. Together, these studies suggest that damage to the collagenous matrix is itself an important inducer of new vessel formation.", "journal": "British journal of cancer", "date": "2008-04-30", "authors": ["JVarani", "PPerone", "R LWarner", "M KDame", "SKang", "G JFisher", "J JVoorhees"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.bjc.6604357"}

Later, Kamei and Omokawa described a similar flap in finger reconstruction, which was supplied either by the radial artery or its volar branch.\nBetween 1997 and 2005 14 free thenar flaps were performed at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for thumb (3 cases) and digital reconstruction (11 cases). In 6 cases, the pulp was involved whereas in the remaining 8 cases, the lesion was either in the volar (6 cases) or in the dorsal surface (2 cases) of the fingers. In 7 patients, a perforating branch rising about 3 cm proximal to the wrist crease was the main vascular source of the flap. In 8 cases, the volar radial artery provided adequate blood supply to the flap. No sensory nerve was included in the flap dissection.\nTwo patients underwent reexploration for arterial thrombosis and venous congestion, respectively, which resulted in complete survival in this series. Donor site morbidity was inconspicuous and, in all cases, the thenar flap provided a well-padded tissue with glabrous skin. In the 7 patients who came back for a final evaluation, 2PD showed poor recover.\nThe free thenar flap offers a thick skin of similar glabrous texture to that of the digits.

{"title": "Free digital artery flap: an ideal flap for large finger defects in situations where local flaps are precluded.", "abstract": "The heterodigital arterialized flap is increasingly accepted as a flap of choice for reconstruction of large finger wounds. However, in situations where the adjacent fingers sustained concomitant injuries, the use of this flap as a local flap is precluded. This paper describes our experience with the free digital artery flap as an evolution of the heterodigital arterialized flap. Four patients with large finger wounds were reconstructed with free digital artery flap. Our indications for digital artery free flap were concomitant injuries to adjacent fingers that precluded their use as donor sites. The arterial supply of the flap was from the digital artery and the venous drainage was from the dominant dorsal vein of the finger. The flap was harvested from the ulnar side of the finger. The digital nerve was left in situ to minimize donor morbidity. The donor site was covered with a full-thickness skin graft and secured with bolster dressings. Early intensive mobilization was implemented for all patients. All flaps survived. No venous congestion was noted and primary healing was achieved in all flaps. In addition to providing well-vascularized tissue for coverage of vital structures, the digital artery was also used as a flow-through flap for finger revascularization in one patient. Donor-site morbidity was minimal, with all fingers retaining protective pulp sensation and the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints retaining full ranges of motion. In conclusion, the free digital artery flap is a versatile flap that is ideal for coverage of large-sized finger defects in situations where local flaps are unavailable. Donor-site morbidity can be minimized by preservation of the digital nerve, firmly securing the skin graft with bolster dressings, and early mobilization of the donor finger.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2008-04-30", "authors": ["Chin-HoWong", "Lam-ChuanTeoh", "Jonathan Y-LLee", "Andrew K-TYam", "David B-AKhoo", "Fok-ChuanYong"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e318061b7b0"}
{"title": "Modular extracellular matrices: solutions for the puzzle.", "abstract": "The common technique of growing cells in two-dimensions (2-D) is gradually being replaced by culturing cells on matrices with more appropriate composition and stiffness, or by encapsulation of cells in three-dimensions (3-D). The universal acceptance of the new 3-D paradigm has been constrained by the absence of a commercially available, biocompatible material that offers ease of use, experimental flexibility, and a seamless transition from in vitro to in vivo applications. The challenge-the puzzle that needs a solution-is to replicate the complexity of the native extracellular matrix (ECM) environment with the minimum number of components necessary to allow cells to rebuild and replicate a given tissue. For use in drug discovery, toxicology, cell banking, and ultimately in reparative medicine, the ideal matrix would therefore need to be highly reproducible, manufacturable, approvable, and affordable. Herein we describe the development of a set of modular components that can be assembled into biomimetic materials that meet these requirements. These semi-synthetic ECMs, or sECMs, are based on hyaluronan derivatives that form covalently crosslinked, biodegradable hydrogels suitable for 3-D culture of primary and stem cells in vitro, and for tissue formation in vivo. The sECMs can be engineered to provide appropriate biological cues needed to recapitulate the complexity of a given ECM environment.

{"title": "The peripheral xylem of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) berries. 2.

In a companion paper, evidence was presented that the vast majority of xylem tracheary elements remained intact despite the growth of the berry, and it was proposed that existing tracheary elements stretch to accommodate growth and that additional elements may also differentiate after veraison. Measurements of the intergyre distance of tracheary elements in macerated tissue were used to test for stretching, and the numbers of tracheary elements per vascular bundle and of branch points of the peripheral xylem network were analysed to test for continued differentiation from 18 to 120 d after anthesis in Chardonnay berries. The distance between the epidermis and the vasculature increased substantially from pre- to post-veraison, potentially increasing the amount of skin available for analysis of compounds important for winemaking. Tracheary elements continued to differentiate within the existing vascular bundles throughout berry development. Additional vascular bundles also appeared until after veraison, thereby increasing the complexity of the peripheral vascular network. The results also confirmed that tracheary elements stretched by approximately 20%, but this was not as much as that predicted based on the growth of the vascular diameter (40%). These results complete a comprehensive evaluation of grape berry peripheral xylem during its development and show that tracheary development continues further into berry maturation than previously thought.", "journal": "Journal of experimental botany", "date": "2008-04-29", "authors": ["David SChatelet", "Thomas LRost", "Mark AMatthews", "Kenneth AShackel"], "doi": "10.1093/jxb/ern061"}

Biochemical studies showed that the ESCC-induced activation of the fibroblasts was required to induce vascular network formation via a transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent pathway.\nConditioned media from a panel of 4 ESCC lines transdifferentiated normal esophageal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts via TGF-beta signaling. The presence of fibroblasts was essential for efficient HMVEC network formation, and the addition of ESCC cells to these cultures greatly enhanced the angiogenic process. The role of TGF-beta in this process was shown by the complete inhibition of network formation following TGF-beta inhibitor treatment. Finally, we showed that ESCC-derived TGF-beta regulates angiogenesis through the release of VEGF from the fibroblasts and that the VEGF release was blocked following TGF-beta inhibition.\nThis study shows the essential role of fibroblasts in the ESCC angiogenic-induced response and suggests that the pharmacologic targeting of the TGF-beta signaling axis could be of therapeutic benefit in this deadly disease.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "date": "2008-04-29", "authors": ["KazuhiroNoma", "Keiran S MSmalley", "MercedesLioni", "YoshioNaomoto", "NoriakiTanaka", "WafikEl-Deiry", "Alastair JKing", "HiroshiNakagawa", "MeenhardHerlyn"], "doi": "10.1053/j.gastro.2008.02.061"}

To further realize this application, we synthesized a series of structurally similar hydrogels and tested their ability to modulate angiogenesis. Hydrogels were synthesized from poly(DTE-co-x% DT carbonate) crosslinked by y% poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Hydrogel desaminotyrosyl tyrosine (DT) contents (x%) ranged from 10-100%, and crosslink densities (y% PEG-crosslinker) ranged from 5-80%. The hydrogels were fashioned into porous scaffolds with highly interconnected macro- and micro-pore (>100 and 10 mm in diameter, respectively) architecture using poly(DTE-co-10%DT carbonate% crosslinked with 8% PEG. Under physiological conditions (in vitro), the hydrogels degraded into three major products: desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine ethyl ester (DTE), desaminotyrosyl tyrosine (DT), and poly(ethylene glycol)-di-DT-hydrazide (PEG-di-DT hydrazide). Increasing either DT content or crosslink density brought quickened degradation. Because DT and DTE, two of the three major degradation products, have not demonstrated any noticeable cytotoxicity or angiogenic effect in previous studies, we measured the cytotoxicity of PEG-di-DT hydrazide, the third major degradation product. We found that PEG-di-DT hydrazide only displayed significant cytotoxicity at the high concentration of 100 mg/mL. Interestingly, PEG-di-DT hydrazide and its further degradation product PEG-dihydrazide stimulated in vitro endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis, which is comparable to results found with FGF-beta treatment. Subcutaneous implantation of the PEG-crosslinked poly(DTE-co-10%DT carbonate) scaffolds into the backs of rats elicited greater tissue growth over time and superior vascularization than poly(DTE carbonate) implantation.

To determine the function of HIF-2alpha in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), we examined vascular formation in HIF-2alpha knockdown (kd/kd) mice transplanted with tumors. We observed that both the tumor size and the number of large vessels growing within transplanted melanomas were significantly reduced in kd/kd recipients compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, we observed a similar extent of vascular formation within fibrosarcomas transplanted from either kd/kd or WT mice into WT recipients. Thus, HIF-2alpha expression in host animal ECs, but not in the tumor cells, is crucial for tumor neovascularization. HIF-2alpha may function through ephrin A1 as the expression of ephrin A1 and related genes was markedly reduced in kd/kd ECs, and HIF-2alpha specifically bound a hypoxia-response element sequence in the ephrin A1 promoter. Treatment of WT ECs with an ephrin A1 inhibitor (ephrin A1-Fc) also impaired neovascularization.

Flow cytometric analysis revealed the presence of three patterns concerning the immunophenotype of the third eyelid tissue. Dogs without ocular insult or deficient tear production might belong to one of the following immunophenotype patterns: I--the number of T-cells that expressed CD3(+) CD8(+) was higher than the number of cells that expressed CD3(+)CD4(+). II--the number of cells CD3(+)C4(+) was higher than the number of cells CD3(+)CD8(+) and in this case a higher number of cells that expressed CD19 were identified. III--Proximity of values of the cells that expressed CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+). These data might suggest that the number of lymphocyte T cells alone should not be considered a direct indicator of the presence of an immune-based inflammation. Besides, a particular population of T-cells does not indicate a particular inflammatory state. The morphological study of the third eyelid revealed a rather uncommon angioarchitecture. The artery that irrigates the eyelid crosses almost the entire length of this structure to achieve its free border, and only then, ramificates deeply towards an inner segmental level. This spatial microvascular arrangement probably results from an adaptation to the fact that the third eyelid, in the medial cantus of the eye, is inwardly compressed into a tiny space.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has been shown to have a high sensitivity and specifity for the differentiation of hepatic and neuroendocrine tumors. Twelve patients (7 women and 5 men; aged 24-74 years) with ACC were treated in our centre from 2004 to 2006. The patients received staging with a contrast-enhanced multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) as well as with a conventional and an echo-enhanced ultrasound of the liver. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound demonstrated liver metastases in 8 out of 12 patients (67%) and MSCT in 6 out of 12 patients (50%). In 2 out of 8 patients (25%) MSCT did not detect the liver metastases.

Sonographic features that were reviewed included the size and echogenicity of the tumors, the presence of cystic areas or calcifications, and detectable blood flow on color Doppler imaging. Correlation of sonographic findings with pathologic results was performed.\nThe tumors ranged from 0.4 to 7 cm in diameter, but most were less than 3 cm in diameter. Four (27%) of the 15 tumors were homogeneously hypoechoic. Two tumors (13%) were predominantly hypoechoic with isoechoic areas to thyroid parenchyma. Two (13%) neoplasms were isoechoic to thyroid parenchyma. Four (27%) tumors were predominantly isoechoic, containing hypoechoic areas, and 3 (20%) tumors were hyperechoic. Three neoplasms contained cystic components. None of the tumors contained calcifications. One tumor was avascular on Doppler examination. One neoplasm showed only peripheral blood flow. Thirteen tumors showed internal vascularity, 7 of them with peripheral blood flow. Twelve HCNs were benign, and 3 were malignant on pathologic examination.\nH\u00fcrthle cell neoplasms show a spectrum of sonographic appearances from predominantly hypoechoic to hyperechoic lesions and from peripheral blood flow with no internal flow to extensively vascularized lesions. Pathologic criteria differentiating benign and malignant HCNs (absence or presence of a capsular breach, vascular or extrathyroidal tissue invasion, nodal involvement, and distant metastasis) are beyond the resolution of sonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy and require removal of the entire lesion.

{"title": "Development of in vivo muCT evaluation of neovascularisation in tissue engineered bone constructs.", "abstract": "Due to an increasing aging population the need for innovative approaches to aid skeletal repair and reconstruction is a significant socio-economic increasing problem. The emerging discipline of tissue engineering has sort to augment the growth and repair of bone loss particularly in areas of trauma, degeneration and revision surgery. However, the initiation and development of a fully functional vascular network are critical for bioengineered bone to repair large osseous defects, whether the material is osteosynthetic (poly (d,l)-lactic acid, PLA) or natural bone allograft. Quantification and three-dimensional visualization of new vessel networks remain a problem in bone tissue engineering constructs. A novel technique utilising a radio-opaque dye and micro-computed tomography (muCT) has been developed and applied to study angiogenesis in an impaction bone graft model. Tissue-engineered constructs combining human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) with natural allograft and synthetic grafts (PLA) were impacted and implanted into the subcutis of MF-1 nu/nu mice for a period of 28 days. Microfil consisting of radio-opaque polymer was perfused through the mice and scanned using a Bench Top CT system for micro-computed tomography. Analysis of three-dimensional muCT reconstructions demonstrated an increase in vessel volume and vessel number in the impacted scaffolds/HBMC compared to scaffolds alone. Vessel volume: allograft/HBMSC=0.57 mm(3)+/-0.19; allograft=0.04 mm(3)+/-0.04; PLA/HBMSC=1.19 mm(3)+/-0.31; and PLA=0.12 mm(3)+/-0.01.

This view however does not take into account the fact that the brain is highly vascularized and that the vasculature harbors a high density of glutamate transporters. In this article, we review the accumulated data establishing the existence of an efflux of excess Glu from brain extracellular fluids into blood. We describe plausible mechanisms accounting for this efflux and present evidence that the brain-to-blood Glu efflux is modulated by blood Glu levels and can be accelerated by blood Glu scavenging. The latter procedure shown here to afford brain neuroprotection in a rat model of closed head injury could be applicable, as a first-line therapy, in the various acute brain insults characterized by excess Glu in brain fluids.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2008-04-22", "authors": ["V ITeichberg", "KCohen-Kashi-Malina", "ICooper", "AZlotnik"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.02.075"}

We have developed four congenic rat strains, each of which carries, on the genetic background of the ACI rat strain, alleles from the COP rat strain that span one of these quantitative trait loci. Relative to the female ACI rats, female ACI.COP-Ept1 rats exhibited reduced responsiveness to 17beta-estradiol (E2) in the pituitary gland, as evidenced by quantification of pituitary mass and circulating prolactin, and in the mammary gland, as evidenced by reduced susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The ACI.COP-Ept2 rat strain exhibited reduced responsiveness to E2 in the pituitary gland but did not differ from the ACI strain in regard to susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. Interestingly, female Ept2 congenic rats exhibited increased responsiveness to E2 in the thymus, as evidenced by enhanced thymic atrophy. The ACI.COP-Ept6 rat strain exhibited increased responsiveness to E2 in the pituitary gland, which was associated with a qualitative phenotype suggestive of enhanced pituitary vascularization. The ACI.COP-Ept9 rat strain exhibited reduced responsiveness to E2 in the anterior pituitary gland, relative to the ACI rat strain.

{"title": "A role for the podosome/invadopodia scaffold protein Tks5 in tumor growth in vivo.", "abstract": "Podosomes and invadopodia are electron-dense, actin-rich protrusions located on the ventral side of the cellular membrane. They are detected in various types of normal cells, but also in human cancer cells and in Src-transformed fibroblasts. Previously we have shown that the scaffold protein Tks5 (tyrosine kinase substrate 5) co-localizes to podosomes/invadopodia in different human cancer cells and in Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells. Upon reduced expression of Tks5 podosome formation is decreased, which leads to diminished gelatin degradation in vitro in various human cancer cell lines. It is unclear, however, whether cancer cells need podosomes for tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. To test this idea, we evaluated the ability of Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells, showing stable reduced expression of Tks5 and podosome formation (Tks5 KD), to form subcutaneous tumors in mice. We demonstrate that decreased expression of Tks5 correlated with reduced tumor growth at this site. In addition, we generated lung metastases from these cells following tail vein injection. The lungs of mice injected i.v. with the Tks5 KD showed smaller-sized metastases, but there was no difference in the number of lesions compared to the controls, indicating that podosomes may not be required for extravasation from the blood stream into the lung parenchyma. Independent of the microenvironment however, the reduced tumor growth correlated with decreased tumor vascularization. Our data potentially implicate a novel role of podosomes as mediators of tumor angiogenesis and support further exploration of how podosome formation and Tks5 expression contribute to tumor progression.", "journal": "European journal of cell biology", "date": "2008-04-18", "authors": ["BarbaraBlouw", "Darren FSeals", "IanPass", "Bego\u00f1aDiaz", "Sara ACourtneidge"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejcb.2008.02.008"}

The aim of the present study is to examine vascularity in primary breast carcinomas and its prognostic significance and relationship with tumor cell dissemination.\nA total of 498 invasive breast carcinomas were analyzed. Representative tumor sections were stained for CD34 and CD105, and vascularity was quantified by the Chalkley method. The relationship between Chalkley counts, vascular invasion, disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in the bone marrow, other clinicopathologic variables, and clinical outcome was evaluated.\nHigh vascular grades determined by Chalkley counts were significantly associated with shorter distant disease-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival in all patients (P < 0.001, log-rank) and in node-negative patients not receiving adjuvant systemic therapy (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, both CD34 and CD105 Chalkley counts showed prognostic significance for distant disease-free survival (P = 0.014 and P = 0.026), whereas CD34 also showed prognostic significance for breast cancer-specific survival (P = 0.007). Vascular invasion and DTCs in the bone marrow showed independent prognostic significance. DTC did not discriminate survival for CD34 low Chalkley counts, whereas a very poor prognosis was observed for DTC-positive patients with high CD34 counts. In node-negative patients not receiving systemic chemotherapy, high CD34 and high CD105 counts in combination identified patients with unfavorable outcome, as opposed to all other CD34/CD105 combinations.\nImproved identification of risk groups could be obtained by adding CD34 and CD105 vascular analysis to DTC, vascular invasion, and other primary tumor factors.

Here, we investigate the role of TSP-1 in tumor-stroma reaction, which is mainly characterized by fibroblast activation to create a permissive microenvironment for tumor progression. Immunohistochemistry examinations in the human surgical specimens have shown that a downregulation of TSP-1 during the progression of cervical carcinogenesis was accompanied by an emergence in the upregulation of stroma markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and desmin. Transfection of SiHa cervical cancer cells with a plasmid expressing the TSP-1 protein exhibited antiangiogenic activity in vitro and resulted in reduced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, which was accompanied by a decrease in tumor vascularization and lower expressions of alpha-SMA and desmin than those in the vector controls. Transfection with TSP-1 and purified TSP-1 added to NIH3T3 cells did not alter the protein levels of alpha-SMA and desmin but significantly inhibited matrix metalloprotease-2 activity. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a major factor in the activation of fibroblasts, increased alpha-SMA and desmin expression and the ability of cell migration and invasion in NIH3T3 cells. The increased migration ability and the invasive ability into tumor cluster of TGF-beta-treated NIH3T3 cells were dose dependently inhibited by TSP-1. In contrast, ectopic TSP-1 expression in SiHa cells has little effect on the invasive ability of the NIH3T3 cells. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel role of TSP-1 to inhibit tumor-stroma reaction that could be attributed to the blockage of activated fibroblasts from invading cancer cells.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2008-04-17", "authors": ["Ming-PingWu", "Ming-JerYoung", "Ching-CherngTzeng", "Chii-RueyTzeng", "Kuo-FengHuang", "Li-WhaWu", "Cheng-YangChou"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgn077"}

Immune tolerance occurs despite the local presence of an active maternal immune system including macrophages, dendritic cells and specialized CD56(bright)CD16(-) uterine natural killer (uNK) cells (65-70%). Recent observations indicate that the phenotypic and functional repertoire of uNK cells is distinct from peripheral blood NK and endometrial NK cells, challenging the understanding of their temporal occurrence and function. Origin and specialized programming of uNK cells continue to be debated. uNK cells, replete with an armamentarium to kill the foreign, tolerate the conceptus and facilitate pregnancy. Why do these uNK cells remain non-cytotoxic? Are these NK cells 'multitasking' in nature harboring beneficial and detrimental roles in pregnancy? Are there distinct subpopulations of NK cells that may populate the decidua? We propose that the endometrium/decidua functions as an 'inducible tertiary lymphoid tissue' that supports the recruitment and expansion of CD56(bright)CD16(-) NK cells and induces transcriptional up-regulation of angiogenic machinery in response to exposure to local hormonal factors, cytokine milieu and perhaps hypoxia. The angiogenic features of uNK cells could further result in a 'multitasking' phenotype that still remains to be characterized.

Many authors studied vascular organization of the hand on its dorsal side; most of them insisted on deep vascularization into the intermetacarpal spaces, which is formed by the dorsal metacarpal arteries. Those dorsal metacarpal arteries are the anatomical support of many flaps, which do not preserve the dorsal interosseous muscles fascias. Only few authors described dorsal vascular organization at the level of the proximal phalanx; however, using a rotation point of a flap distally to the metacarpal head with a donor site on the dorsal aspect of the hand could cover all distal soft tissue defect of long finger. In order to determine the technical limitations of dorsal digito-metacarpal flap procedures, we studied number and location of arterial anastomoses between the reticular subcutaneous dorsal network and the rest of the vascularization at this level, which was formed by the deeper dorsal metacarpal arteries, common palmar digital arteries and proper palmar digital arteries, and between the dorsal digital arteries. Twenty-four long fingers from embalmed cadavers were studied after a reverse flow injection of colored latex and dissected layer-by-layer preserving the digital-metacarpal arterial network. At the level of the hand, the dorsal metacarpal arteries of the third and fourth intermetacarpal spaces were inconstant. When present, two or three arteries anastomosed in star shape with the reticular network. No such arterial anastomosis was observed proximally to the level of the intertendinous connections (junctura tendinorum) that bridge the extensor digitorum communis tendons. When no dorsal metacarpal artery was present, some communicant arteries arose from the common palmar digital arteries. Moreover, all the nutrient branches were more numerous distally to the intertendinous connections (junctura tendinorum). At the level of the metacarpophalangeal joints, the hand cutaneous network was always anastomosed with the dorsal cutaneous network. At the level of fingers, the dorsal cutaneous network was always supplied by four branches arising from the proper digital artery.

{"title": "Morphology and function of cryopreserved whole ovine ovaries after heterotopic autotransplantation.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to perform complex characterization of cryopreserved and then autotransplanted ovaries including determination of the ability to respond to in vivo follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)-treatment, fertilizability of retrieved oocytes, and morphology, vascularization, cellular proliferation and apoptosis in sheep.\nMature crossbred ewes were divided into two groups; an intact (control) group (n = 4), and autotransplanted group (n = 4) in which oophorectomy was performed laparoscopically and ovaries with intact vascular pedicles frozen, thawed and transplanted back into the same animal at a different site. Approximately five months after autotransplantation, estrus was synchronized, ewes were treated with FSH, and ovaries were collected. For all ovaries, number of visible follicles was determined, and collected cumulus oocyte complexes (COC) were matured and fertilized in vitro. Remaining ovarian tissues were fixed for evaluation of morphology, expression of factor VIII (marker of endothelial cells), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; expressed by pericytes and smooth muscle cells), and smooth muscle cell actin (SMCA; marker of pericytes and smooth muscle cells), and cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Two fully functional ovaries were collected from each control ewe (total 8 ovaries).\nOut of eight autotransplanted ovaries, a total of two ovaries with developing follicles were found. Control ewes had 10.6 +/- 2.7 follicles/ovary, oocytes were in vitro fertilized and developed to the blastocyst stage. One autotransplanted ewe had 4 visible follicles from which 3 COC were collected, but none of them was fertilized. The morphology of autotransplanted and control ovaries was similar. In control and autotransplanted ovaries, primordial, primary, secondary, antral and preovulatory follicles were found along with fully functional vascularization which was manifested by expression of factor VIII, VEGF and SMCA. Proliferating cells were detected in follicles, and the rate of apoptosis was minimal in ovaries of control and autotransplanted ovaries.\nThese data demonstrate successful autotransplantation of a portion of frozen/thawed ovaries manifested by restoration of selected ovarian function including in vitro maturation of collected oocytes, presence of follicles from several stages of folliculogenesis and blood vessels expressing specific markers of vascularization, and proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cells. Thus, heterotopic autotransplantation of a whole frozen/thawed ovary allows for development of preovulatory follicles, oocyte growth, and for restoration of vascularization and cellular function. However, additional improvements are required to enhance the efficiency of autotransplantation of frozen/thawed ovaries to produce more oocytes.", "journal": "Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E", "date": "2008-04-12", "authors": ["Anna TGrazul-Bilska", "JashomanBanerjee", "IlkerYazici", "EwaBorowczyk", "Jerzy JBilski", "Rakesh KSharma", "MariaSiemionov", "TommasoFalcone"], "doi": "10.1186/1477-7827-6-16\n10.1002/cncr.10978\n10.1080/1464727022000198942\n10.1210/jc.2003-030352\n10.1093/humupd/7.6.535\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2003.06.031\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.06.036\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.11.019\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17222-X\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.06.011\n10.1093/humupd/dml032\n10.1056/NEJMc055237\n10.1093/humrep/del227\n10.1007/s10561-005-1969-7\n10.1080/01913120600820187\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.08.115\n10.1113/jphysiol.2004.082032\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2003.11.023\n10.1210/en.140.1.462\n10.1016/S0015-0282(02)03110-2\n10.1016/S0015-0282(02)04842-2\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.03.079\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.11.030\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2007.08.004\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.06.046\n10.1093/humrep/dei278\n10.1016/S0093-691X(02)01192-5\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2005.06.013\n10.1016/S0093-691X(01)00542-8\n10.1530/rep.1.00434\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2004.08.015\n10.1095/biolreprod47.5.698\n10.1210/en.133.4.1871\n10.1095/biolreprod65.3.879\n10.1530/rep.1.01062\n10.2527/jas.2007-0044\n10.1095/biolreprod53.1.8\n10.1093/humrep/dem405\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.05.019\n10.1016/S0015-0282(01)02960-0\n10.1093/humrep/dei155\n10.1093/humrep/del007\n10.1093/humrep/dei155\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.05.086\n10.1093/humrep/del440\n10.1097/GCO.0b013e328247f411\n10.1095/biolreprod51.3.531"}
{"title": "[Outcome of photodynamic therapy for subretinal neovascularization secondary to choroidal nevi].", "abstract": "Choroidal nevi are the most common benign intraocular tumors. However, the occurrence of subretinal neovascularization secondary to choroidal nevus is very rare. Our goal was to assess the efficacy and the safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treatment of subretinal neovascularization related to choroidal nevi.\nWe conducted a retrospective study including subretinal neovascularization secondary to choroidal nevi treated by PDT from 1999 to 2005. PDT was performed according to the standard protocols used for treating neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Post-PDT follow-up was also done according to the guidelines used in ARMD. Moreover, tumors were followed up every 3 months.\nSix subretinal neovascularizations secondary to choroidal nevi were included in our study. All nevi were localized in the posterior choroids. The median diameter of tumors was 3mm and their thickness was less than 2mm in all cases. Subretinal neovascularizations were classic in five cases. The last case was a small vascularized pigment epithelium detachment. Locations were subfoveal in two cases, juxtafoveal in three cases, and extrafoveal in one case. In half the cases, the size of subretinal neovascularization was 1-disk-diameter or less. A mean of 3.3 sessions of PDT were necessary to obtain the stabilization of subretinal neovascularization on both fluorescein angiography and OCT. The average follow-up period was 35 months with no patients lost to follow-up. Visual outcomes were extremely variable. Large or subfoveal neovascularization but also a history of atrophic ARMD were related to worse functional results. No growth of the nevi was observed.\nSubretinal neovascularization is reassuring from the oncologist's point of view because it is considered a relative indicator of benignity of the nevus. However, it often marks a definitive turning point in visual function. PDT appears to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment subretinal neovascularization secondary to choroidal nevus, with results similar to those observed in ARMD.", "journal": "Journal francais d'ophtalmologie", "date": "2008-04-11", "authors": ["JGambrelle", "MMauget Fa\u00ffsse", "MQuaranta El-Maftouhi", "J DGrange"], "doi": "10.1016/s0181-5512(08)70327-9"}

This species has no vascular network in the tunic, unlike the botryllid ascidians, which have a vascular network throughout the colony's common tunic. In the allorejection reaction induced by contact at the growing edges, some small, hard-packed tunic masses were formed at the contact points. Histological and electron microscopic investigation of these tunic masses revealed that they contained aggregates of tunic cells, with tunic phagocytes being the major cell type present. Some of the tunic phagocytes in these tunic masses appeared to be disintegrating. When allogeneic colonies were placed in contact at their artificial cut surfaces, the colonies partially fused, then separated. In this allorejection reaction, some loosely packed tunic masses remained in the gap between the two withdrawn colonies. These results strongly suggest that the tunic phagocytes are likely to be the major effector cells in the allorejection reaction.

{"title": "Malignant bone tumors.", "abstract": "Malignant bone tumors represent a small percentage of cancers nationwide and also are much less common than malignant soft-tissue tumors. The rarity of the condition makes it imperative that orthopaedic surgeons in nononcologic practices are able to recognize the symptoms that suggest a possible bony malignancy to avoid inappropriate or delayed treatment. The most common primary malignant bone tumors, osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma, occur in childhood. Chondrosarcoma occurs more frequently in older adults. Rare tumors such as chordoma and adamantinoma have anatomic predilections for the sacrum and tibia, respectively. The primary symptom of a patient with a malignant bone tumor is pain, which often occurs at rest or at night. There are also characteristic findings on physical examination such as swelling or decreased joint range of motion. Patients with a likely malignancy require thorough staging to determine the extent of disease and a well-planned biopsy for accurate diagnosis. The biopsy can be an image-guided needle biopsy or an open incisional biopsy. Knowledge of specific tumor characteristics and treatment options for osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, chordoma, and adamantinoma is important. Patients with osteosarcoma and resectable Ewing's sarcoma are treated with chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. Secondary sarcomas can occur in previously benign bone lesions and require aggressive treatment. Specific techniques are available for the resection of malignant bone tumors from the upper extremities, lower extremities, pelvis, and spine. Reconstruction options include the use of allografts, megaprostheses, and vascularized autografts. There has been a trend toward more prosthetic reconstructions because of early complications with allografts. The care of patients with primary malignant bone tumors requires a multidisciplinary approach to treatment.

Understand the evaluation of a patient with a lower extremity wound. 2. Determine when an attempt at wound salvage is likely to be successful. 3. Select an appropriate technique for wound management. 4. Anticipate and identify wound complications.\nSuccessful management of a patient's wound at or distal to the knee includes accurate site assessment, meticulous debridement, planning, and execution of a reasonable operative procedure. Outlining a reconstructive plan requires consideration of alternatives from basic to most complex, then selection of the simplest technique likely to achieve wound closure with minimal donor-site morbidity. Healing by secondary intention, with or without vacuum-assisted closure, demands few surgical resources. A skin graft may close a well-vascularized wound. A local skin, fasciocutaneus, or muscle flap can provide vascularized tissue to an otherwise ischemic area. A plastic surgeon may use free tissue transfer in the more difficult anatomic regions, particularly for defects of the distal one-third of the lower leg. Other issues demand consideration when treating a patient with a lower extremity wound. Anesthetic options range from none in the case of secondary intention healing, through prolonged general anesthesia in the circumstance of free tissue transfer. Early recognition of a complication makes successful treatment of that problem more rapid and more likely to be successful. Accurate CPT coding ensures appropriate reimbursement for the reconstructive surgeon and fairness to the payer. Finally, some wounds are so extensive and patients so ill from related or unrelated pathologic processes that attempts at reconstruction are ill advised.

The concentration of VEGF was assessed in the plasma of 103 women with breast cancer, using an immunoenzymatic method (Quantikine test of R&D Systems). Assessment of microvessel density was performed using histopathological immunoperoxidase methods, using an anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (DAKO A/S). A statistically significant relationship was found between rising VEGF levels and microvessel density in women with breast cancer, when compared to values from a control group. A correlation was found between VEGF concentration and microvessel density (MVD) values. Statistically significant differences were found between VEGF levels of patients in stages I, II and III of clinical disease advancement. For MVD, differences were found only between stages I and III. A statistical relationship was also found between VEGF and MVD and tumour size. Similar results were found between VEGF concentrations in women with metastases to the axillary lymph nodes and cytokine levels in women with no metastases.

The mechanisms for enhanced antitumoral effects are still a matter of controversial debate. Tumor vessel \"normalization\" upon anti-angiogenic therapy leading to improved drug delivery has been proposed as possible mechanism. Therefore, aim of the study was to investigate tumor microvascular function upon anti-VEGFR treatment in highly vascularized melanomas. A detailed intravital-microscopic analysis of tumor microcirculation including the distribution pattern of vessel diameters and blood flow velocities was performed in melanomas grown in dorsal skinfold chambers of hamsters. Animals with highly vascularized established tumors were treated by a VEGFR tyrosin kinase inhibitor (SU5416) on 3 repetitive days. Tumor tissue oxygenation was measured by phosphorescence quenching technique. Overall tumor microcirculation of subcutaneous tumors was investigated by contrast enhanced MRI (CE-MRI). Vessel density was significantly decreased in treated animals. A significant shift in the distribution patterns towards increased vessel diameters and faster red blood cell velocities in remaining tumor vessels was observed upon anti-VEGF treatment, compensating reduced vascular density. Moreover, a trend towards elevated pO(2) levels in treated tumors was observed. Compared to controls, inflow kinetics of tumors quantified by CE-MRI as well as overall uptake of contrast agent in tumor tissue were significantly increased following short-term SU5416 treatment. In conclusion the results confirm temporarily improved tumor microvascular function in highly vascularized melanomas upon short term anti-VEGFR treatment leading to enhanced tumor blood supply and oxygenation potentially improving the efficacy of simultaneous chemo- or radiotherapy.", "journal": "Cancer biology & therapy", "date": "2008-04-10", "authors": ["M EEichhorn", "SStrieth", "SLuedemann", "AKleespies", "UN\u00f6th", "APasson", "GBrix", "K WJauch", "C JBruns", "MDellian"], "doi": "10.4161/cbt.7.7.5997"}

Surgical debridement and larval therapy showed no significant benefit. Other debridement methods such as enzyme preparations or polysaccharide beads have not been evaluated in RCTs of people with diabetes. More than 300 articles have been published on negative pressure wound therapy, including several small RCTs and a larger multi-centre RCT of diabetic foot ulcers.

Moreover, proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors can directly bind integrins and regulate endothelial cell behavior.

{"title": "Extracellular matrix mediates a molecular balance between vascular morphogenesis and regression.", "abstract": "We discuss very recent studies that address the critical role of extracellular matrix in controlling the balance between vascular morphogenesis and regression. Much of this work suggests that a balance mechanism exists for controlling the extent of tissue vascularization involving downstream signaling events regulating endothelial cell behaviors in relation to their interactions with extracellular matrix molecules.\nEndothelial gene expression changes and signaling lead to events that not only stimulate vascular morphogenesis but also suppress mechanisms mediated through pro-regression factors such as Rho kinase. At the same time, vascular networks are susceptible to regression mediated by factors such as matrix metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-10, thrombospondin-1, extracellular matrix matricryptic fragments and angiopoietin-2. Pericyte recruitment to such vascular tubes can prevent regression events by delivering molecules such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 and angiopoietin-1 that promote vascular stabilization by decreasing tube susceptibility to these regression stimuli.\nExtracellular matrix-derived signals lead to critical morphologic changes mediated through cytoskeletal rearrangements that control the shape, function and signaling events in endothelial cell-lined vessels regulating tube formation, remodeling, stabilization and regression. These signals control both vascular morphogenic and regression events, and thus a molecular balance exists to control the extent and function of vascular tube networks within tissues.", "journal": "Current opinion in hematology", "date": "2008-04-09", "authors": ["George EDavis", "Donald RSenger"], "doi": "10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282fcc321"}

This epithelial-NC interaction is crucial for thymus development, but it is not known how NC supports thymus development or whether NC cells or their progeny make any significant contribution to the adult thymus. By nude mouse blastocyst complementation and by cell surface phenotype, we could previously separate thymus stroma into Foxn1-dependent epithelial cells and a Foxn1-independent mesenchymal cell population. These mesenchymal cells expressed vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and contributed to thymus vascularization. These data suggested a physical or functional association with thymic blood vessels, but the origin, location in the thymus, and function of these stromal cells remained unknown. Using a transgenic mouse expressing Cre recombinase in premigratory NC (Sox10-Cre), we have now fate-mapped the majority of these adult mesenchymal cells to a NC origin. NC-derived cells represent tightly vessel-associated pericytes that are sandwiched between endothelium and epithelium along the entire thymus vasculature. The ontogenetic, phenotypic, and positional definition of this distinct perivascular mesenchymal compartment provides a cellular basis for the role of NC in thymus development and possibly maintenance, and might be useful to address properties of the endothelial-epithelial barrier in the adult thymus.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2008-04-09", "authors": ["Susanna MM\u00fcller", "Claus CStolt", "GrzegorzTerszowski", "CarmenBlum", "TakashiAmagai", "NicolettaKessaris", "PalmaIannarelli", "William DRichardson", "MichaelWegner", "Hans-ReimerRodewald"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.180.8.5344"}

Over a period of 4 years (2002-2005), 5 men and 2 women were managed. Median age was 21 years (range 15-49). The patients were managed for complicated lower trunk, groin, and upper thigh wounds after resection of three pelvic chondrosarcomas as well as two pelvic and two proximal femur osteosarcomas. The modifications included a VRAM flap with lateral and tongue-like extension design of the skin paddle (5 cases) or a delayed extended VRAM flap (2 cases). Results. All flaps showed complete survival and healing with no ischemic events providing stable coverage.

Mixed chimerism was enhanced in recipients given two-four-times BM with MSC infusions. Interestingly, four-times BM infusions with MSC delayed GVHD onset, reduced host tissue damage and enhanced vascularized skin allograft survival compared to four-times BM alone.

Vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous (VRAM) flaps have been used in an attempt to reduce these complications by obliterating the noncollapsible dead space with vascularized tissue and closing the perineal skin defect with nonirradiated flap skin. Many surgeons are reluctant to use VRAM flaps unless primary closure is not possible.\nAll patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy and APR during a 12-year period at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics and surgical complications and outcomes were compared between patients who underwent VRAM flap reconstruction of wounds that could have been closed primarily (flap group, n = 35) and those who had primary closure of the perineal wound (control group, n = 76).\nOverall, there were no significant differences in the incidence of perineal wound complications between the groups; the flap group had a significantly lower incidence of perineal abscess (9% versus 37%, p = 0.002), major perineal wound dehiscence (9% versus 30%, p = 0.014), and drainage procedures required for perineal/pelvic fluid collections (3% versus 25%, p = 0.003) than the control group had. Despite flap harvest and the need for donor site closure in the flap group, there was no significant difference in abdominal wall complications between groups during the study's mean patient followup of 3.8 years.\nVRAM flap reconstruction of irradiated APR defects reduces major perineal wound complications without increasing early abdominal wall complications.

Isolated mature adipocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells and actively proliferated in ceiling culture. In vitro studies showed that the cells could redifferentiate into mature adipocytes in an identical way to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.

The histologic and biomechanical parameters of pedicled vascularized femoral autotransplants were studied following orthotopic reimplantation in the resulting mid-diaphyseal defect. Vascularized femur segments were isolated in 10 rabbits on their nutrient pedicle, and then replaced orthotopically with appropriate internal fixation. Postoperative weightbearing and mobility were unrestricted, and the contralateral femora served as no-treatment controls. After 16 weeks, the bone flaps were evaluated by x-ray (bone healing), mechanical testing (material properties), microangiography (quantification of intraosseous vasculature), histology (bone viability), and histomorphometry (bone remodeling). Bone healing occurred by 2 weeks, with further callus remodeling throughout the survival period. Eight transplants healed completely, while two had a distal pseudarthrosis. Microangiography demonstrated patent pedicles in all transplants. Intraosseous vessel densities were comparable to nonoperated (control) femora.

Bone tissue forms by eventual differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into either mesenchymal osteoblasts (MOBL), which synthesize woven bone in random orientation, or surface osteoblasts (SOBL), which synthesize bone on surfaces in a well oriented lamellar array. Bone repair uses the same formation patterns as bone development but the specific mechanism of repair is determined by the biomechanical environment provided. Bone synthesis and maintenance are highly dependent on the blood supply of bone and on cell-cell communication via the lacunar-canalicular system. Recent investigations highlight the molecular cascades leading to cell differentiation, the components of the structural proteins such as the various collagens, and tissue vascularization. The patterning of bone matrix from an initial woven to an eventual lamellar orientation is essential for bone to develop its maximum strength. This review demonstrates the repetitive nature of woven to lamellar bone formation as mediated by MOBLs and SOBLs in both normal vertebrate bones and bone repair.

These vaccines are all capable of inducing potent cell-mediated protective immunity against self-antigens, resulting in marked suppression of tumor growth and dissemination. Key mechanisms induced by these DNA vaccines include efficient suppression of angiogenesis in the tumor vasculature and marked activation of cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells. The vaccine targeting Legumain establishes the new paradigm whereby a reduction in the density of TAMs in the TME decreases the release of factors potentiating tumor growth and angiogenesis. This, in turn, remodels the TME and decreases its immunosuppressive milieu and thereby potentiates the DNA vaccine's ability to effectively suppress tumor cell proliferation, vascularization, and metastasis.

Twenty-seven adult New Zealand White rabbits were used as the experimental model. Autogenous bone grafts taken from the cranial bone (intramembranous in origin) and the femur (endochondral in origin) were grafted into skull defects created on either side of the parietal suture. Rabbits were killed on days 1 to 9 postgrafting, and the bone graft alone was harvested for immunolocalization of TIMP-1. In endochondral bone grafts, TIMP-1 was expressed on days 1 to 3, followed by a period of absence until days 8 and 9. Intramembranous bone grafts did not express TIMP-1 until days 6 to 9. The timing and location of TIMP-1 expression coincided with osteogenesis, which indicates a role for TIMP-1 in preserving newly formed bone during the initial stages of graft healing. The differential temporal expression of TIMP-1 in endochondral and intramembranous bone grafts suggests that bone graft type plays an important role in influencing the healing process mediated by the host tissues.

During angiogenesis and tumor growth, HIF-1alpha dimerizes with ARNT, inducing expression of many genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ARNT also dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR-null (Ahr(-/-)) transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice develop prostate tumors with greater frequency than AhR wild-type (Ahr(+/+)) TRAMP mice, even though prevalence of prostate epithelial hyperplasia is not inhibited. This suggests that Ahr inhibits prostate carcinogenesis. In TRAMP mice, prostatic epithelial hyperplasia results in stabilized HIF-1alpha, inducing expression of VEGF, a prerequisite for tumor growth and angiogenesis. Since ARNT is a common dimerization partner of AhR and HIF-1alpha, we hypothesized that the AhR inhibits prostate tumor formation by competing with HIF-1alpha for ARNT, thereby limiting VEGF production. Prostates from Ahr(+/+), Ahr(+/-) and Ahr(-/-) C57BL/6J TRAMP mice were cultured in the presence of graded concentrations of vanadate, an inducer of VEGF through the HIF-1alpha-ARNT pathway. Vanadate induced VEGF protein in a dose-dependent fashion in Ahr(+/-) and Ahr(-/-) TRAMP cultures, but not in Ahr(+/+) cultures. However, vanadate induced upstream proteins in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-signaling cascade to a similar extent in TRAMPs of each Ahr genotype, evidenced by v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (Akt) phosphorylation. These findings suggest that AhR sequesters ARNT, decreasing interaction with HIF-1alpha reducing VEGF production.

In the tumor microenvironment, an upregulation of both VEGF and its receptors occurs, leading to a high concentration of occupied receptors on tumor vascular endothelium. Also, VEGF is involved in the development of the normal vascular network of the thymus. Little is known about VEGF expression in normal and malignant thymic tissue. Our purpose was to study the pattern and localization of VEGF expression in benign conditions of the thymus and thymoma to determine a possible correlation with VEGF receptors VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and microvascular density. All cases were positive for VEGF and VEGFR1, 2 in the epithelial cells, in a cytoplasmic, granular pattern. In the normal thymus, there were positive epithelial cells with subcapsular distribution and Hassall's corpuscle epithelial cells. In acute thymic involution, the positive fields were correlated with dilation and stasis of blood vessels and lymphocyte depletion. Rare positive cells were found in other types of involution; the myasthenic thymus showed an intense and diffuse reaction in lymphoid follicles of the medulla. A strong reaction for VEGF was observed in type B3 thymomas in neoplastic epithelial cells, normal endothelial cells, plasma within the blood vessels and focally in the stroma adjacent to the tumor. Receptors for VEGF were positive in neoplastic epithelial cells and endothelium.

In this study, the heterogeneous composition of immune cells in the CFU-ECs was investigated. We confirmed that monocytes are essential for the formation of CFU-ECs. Also, however, CD4(+) T cells were found to be indispensable for the induction of CFU-EC colonies, mainly through cell-cell contact. By blocking or activating CD3 receptors on CD4(+) T cells or blocking MHC class II molecules on monocytes, it was shown that TCR-MHCII interactions are required for induction of CFU-EC colonies. Because the supernatant from preactivated T cells could also induce colony formation from purified monocytes, the T cell support turned out to be cytokine mediated. Gene expression analysis of the endothelial-like colonies formed by CD14(+) cells showed that colony formation is a proangiogenic differentiation and might reflect the ability of monocytes to facilitate vascularization.

Previous studies have shown that the endothelial cells that vascularize the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which houses the primary afferent sensory neurons, are unique in that they have large fenestrations and are permeable to a variety of low and high molecular weight agents. In the present report we used whole-mount preparations, immunohistochemistry, and confocal laser scanning microscopy to show that the cell body-rich area of the L4 mouse DRG has a 7 fold higher density of CD31+ capillaries than cell fiber rich area of the DRG or the distal or proximal aspect of the sciatic nerve. This dense vascularization, coupled with the high permeability of these capillaries, may synergistically contribute, and in part explain, why many potentially neurotoxic agents preferentially accumulate and injure cells within the DRG. Currently, cancer survivors and HIV patients constitute the largest and most rapidly expanding groups that have chemically induced peripheral sensory neuropathy. Understanding the unique aspects of the vascularization of the DRG and closing the endothelial fenestrations of the rich vascular bed of capillaries that vascularize the DRG before intravenous administration of anti-neoplastic or anti-HIV therapies, may offer a mechanism based approach to attenuate these chemically induced peripheral neuropathies in these patients.", "journal": "Molecular pain", "date": "2008-03-21", "authors": ["Juan MJimenez-Andrade", "Monica BHerrera", "Joseph RGhilardi", "MarinaVardanyan", "Ohannes KMelemedjian", "Patrick WMantyh"], "doi": "10.1186/1744-8069-4-10\n10.3109/10408447309082021\n10.1016/0022-510X(77)90025-9\n10.1016/0300-483X(73)90043-7\n10.1007/BF00687046\n10.1200/JCO.2005.04.0543\n10.1007/PL00007853\n10.1016/j.ejca.2005.06.030\n10.1186/1471-2407-6-5\n10.1046/j.1529-8027.2001.006001021.x\n10.1002/ana.20816\n10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70165-4\n10.1097/00002030-200211080-00002\n10.1016/j.jana.2007.05.003\n10.1080/09540120600971083\n10.1097/00000421-199912000-00005\n10.1002/jemt.1157\n10.1007/s00418-006-0226-x\n10.1007/s00441-005-0139-3\n10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00084-2\n10.2337/diabetes.54.11.3112\n10.1002/ar.1092000110\n10.1002/cne.900670305\n10.1097/00001756-200403010-00004\n10.2307/3428830\n10.1007/BF00215185\n10.1016/0022-510X(76)90083-6\n10.1007/BF00690507\n10.1016/0014-4886(79)90134-1\n10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00135-9\n10.1016/j.brainres.2007.06.066\n10.1159/000116020\n10.1080/13550280290101094\n10.1023/A:1006004809169\n10.1016/j.neulet.2006.06.043\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2006.07.022\n10.1016/j.mcn.2006.03.005\n10.1006/mcne.1999.0814\n10.1046/j.1365-2990.1999.00160.x\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199809)21:9<1188::AID-MUS10>3.0.CO;2-O\n10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13718-X\n10.1007/s11912-007-0036-x\n10.1007/s11912-996-0005-9\n10.1016/S0959-8049(01)00068-5\n10.1016/S0093-7754(03)00399-3\n10.1038/nrn1914\n10.1001/archneur.64.6.794\n10.1002/jnr.20204"}

Although autologous fat transplantation using a minimally invasive cannula harvest has less donor-site morbidity than tissue flaps, there is a variable degree of fat resorption over time. Preadipocytes isolated from harvested fat are better able to withstand the mechanical trauma from the suction cannula and subsequently may result in improved cell survival and generation of new fat tissue after transfer to another anatomic site. The authors hypothesized that particulate small intestinal submucosa could be useful as injectable cell delivery vehicles for preadipocytes, and that the release of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 would enhance vascularization.\nPreadipocytes were isolated from discarded human adipose tissue and cultured on small intestinal submucosa particles in a stirred bioreactor (spinner flask). Preadipocytes attached and proliferated on small intestinal submucosa microparticles and maintained high viability over several weeks of culture.

Although the early induction of selective chemokines in solid organs is required for the optimal recruitment of T cells into rejecting allografts, little is known about the role of these chemokines in high risk corneal allografts.\nOrthotopic corneal allotransplants were performed in low-risk (nonvascularized) and high-risk (vascularized) C57BL/6 (H-2b) recipients using Balb/c (H-2d) donors. Intragraft production of CXC chemokines was measured by Luminex and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on corneal transplant extracts at different times after surgery. Rabbit anti-KC serum was used to test its role in high risk corneal allograft survival.\nEarly upregulation of CXCL1/KC occurs 3 days after transplantation in high risk allograft only. Moreover, the T-cell chemoattractants, CXCL9/Mig and CXCL10/IP10, are produced late (day 10) after surgery and their production correlates with the recruitment of CD4 T cells into the graft. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of CXCL1/KC with anti-KC sera results in increased graft survival and decreased recruitment of T cells into high-risk allografts.\nWe propose that a high risk vascularized cornea behaves like a vascularized solid organ transplant. The early production of CXCL1/KC is crucial to the induction of T-cell chemoattractants necessary for the recruitment of allospecific CD4 T cells into the graft.

For efficient transfection in skeletal muscle, several protocols have been described, including delivery of low voltage electric pulses and a combination of high and low voltage electric pulses. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of different parameters of electrotransfection on short-term and long-term transfection efficiency in murine skeletal muscle, and to evaluate histological changes in the treated tissue. Different parameters of electric pulses, different time lags between plasmid DNA injection and application of electric pulses, and different doses of plasmid DNA were tested for electrotransfection of tibialis cranialis muscle of C57Bl/6 mice using DNA plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transfection efficiency was assessed on frozen tissue sections one week after electrotransfection using a fluorescence microscope and also noninvasively, followed by an in vivo imaging system using a fluorescence stereo microscope over a period of several months. Histological changes in muscle were evaluated immediately or several months after electrotransfection by determining infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells and presence of necrotic muscle fibers. The most efficient electrotransfection into skeletal muscle of C57Bl/6 mice in our experiments was achieved when one high voltage (HV) and four low voltage (LV) electric pulses were applied 5 seconds after the injection of 30 microg of plasmid DNA. This protocol resulted in the highest short-term as well as long-term transfection. The fluorescence intensity of the transfected area declined after 2-3 weeks, but GFP fluorescence was still detectable 18 months after electrotransfection. Extensive inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltration was observed immediately after the electrotransfection procedure using the described parameters, but no necrosis or late tissue damage was observed. This study showed that electric pulse parameters, time lag between the injection of DNA and application of electric pulses, and dose of plasmid DNA affected the duration of transgene expression in murine skeletal muscle.

{"title": "Influence of location, fluid flow direction, and tissue maturity on the macroscopic permeability of vertebral end plates.", "abstract": "We implemented a pilot study in a growing animal model. The macroscopic permeability of the vertebral endplates was measured. The influence of location, tissue maturity, and fluid flow direction was quantified.\nWe hypothesized that the macroscopic permeability of vertebral endplate may decrease with maturity of the vertebral segment.\nThe alternation of loading induced by the diurnal cycle generates convective flux into the vertebral segment with the dominant flow path through the vertebral endplates. The alteration of mass transport at the disc-vertebrae interface may interrupt the mechanobiologic balance, and have an effect such as degenerative changes or scoliosis.\nA previously validated method for measuring permeability, based on the relaxation pressure caused by a transient-flow rate was used. Three specimens were extracted from each L1 to L5 endplate. Seventy-one specimens were frozen, and 64 were stored fresh in a standard culture media. A microscopic analysis completed the biomechanical analysis.\nAt 2, 4, and 6 months, the mean permeability (10(-14) m/N x s, flow-in/flow-out) of the central zone was respectively: 1.23/1.66, 1.03/1.29, and 0.792/1.00. Laterally, it was 1.03/1.19, 1.094/1.001, and 0.765/0.863. For all groups, cartilage endplate and growth plate were both thinner in the center of the plate. Weak differences of the vascular network were detected, except for a small increase of vascular density in the central zone.\nThe results from this animal study showed that the central zone of the vertebral endplate was more permeable than the periphery and the flow-out permeability was up to 35% greater than the flow-in permeability. Increase of permeability with decrease of cartilage thickness was noticed within the same age group. We also found a statistically significant decrease of the macroscopic permeability correlated with the tissue maturity.", "journal": "Spine", "date": "2008-03-18", "authors": ["FranckAccadbled", "Jean-MichelLaffosse", "DominiqueAmbard", "AnneGomez-Brouchet", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salesde Gauzy", "PascalSwider"], "doi": "10.1097/BRS.0b013e318166e0d7"}

Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) and rickets are 2 disorders associated with impairments in this process, mainly in the vascularization of the avian growth plate. In this paper, we induced TD and rickets and studied the expression patterns of 4 members of the MMP family known to be important for endochondral ossification, MMP-2, 3, 9, and 13, in normal and impaired avian growth plates. The expression of MMP-3, 9, and 13 was reduced in the lesions and lined up parallel to the expulsion of blood vessels, which was extended up to the border of the lesion, but did not penetrate into it. Matrix metallopro-teinase-2 was not expressed in the TD lesion but was overexpressed in the rachitic lesion. We also studied the differentiation stage of the chondrocytes populating the lesions and found that the rachitic lesions were populated with proliferative chondrocytes, whereas the TD lesions were filled with chondrocytes that presented both proliferative and hypertrophic markers. These results suggest that MMP-3, 9, and 13 play a role in the vascularization and ossification processes, whereas MMP-2 is related to chondrocyte differentiation and may be involved in cartilage remodeling in the avian growth plate.", "journal": "Journal of animal science", "date": "2008-03-18", "authors": ["MHasky-Negev", "SSimsa", "ATong", "OGenina", "EMonsonego Ornan"], "doi": "10.2527/jas.2007-0738"}

The cells were subjected to 18 h of OGD followed by reoxygenation in the presence of glucose and different extra-cellular H(2)O(2) concentrations since H(2)O(2) affects cell proliferation. After reoxygenation, the cellular H(2)O(2) concentration was increased returning to control levels within 24 h. Within this period, increase in cell number and MTT-reduction were impaired. Regeneration was completed on the third day of reoxygenation. MTT-reduction increased faster than cell number, indicating an OGD-dependent up-regulation of protein expression.

We report our experience using a rectus abdominus myofascial (RAM) interposition flap for VVF repair.\nA retrospective analysis was performed to identify patients who had undergone VVF repair with RAM interposition. Data were collected focusing on preoperative patient characteristics, etiology of VVF, intraoperative parameters, including surgical techniques, and postoperative patient outcomes.\nWe used a RAM interposition flap for VVF repair in 5 patients. All VVFs had developed postoperatively; no patient had received radiotherapy. VVF developed after total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) or radical cystectomy in 3 and 2 cases, respectively. Both cases of VVF after radical cystectomy occurred in conjunction with orthotopic diversion (neobladder-vaginal fistula). In 3 patients with post-TAH VVF, a total of five previous failed repairs were attempted before RAM interposition. In 1 patient with a neobladder-vaginal fistula, who had received adjuvant chemotherapy, RAM interposition failed, and the patient ultimately required cutaneous urinary diversion after two subsequent failed attempts at repair (68 months of follow-up). The remaining 4 patients (80%) had no evidence of recurrent VVF or voiding abnormalities at a mean follow-up of 19 months (range 8 to 32).\nRectus abdominus muscle can be a successful interposition flap during repair of complex, recurrent VVF.

ISV formation is thought to occur in discrete steps. First, endothelial cells of the dorsal aorta migrate out and align along the dorsoventral axis. The dorsal-most cell, also called tip cell, then joins with its anterior and posterior neighbours, thus establishing a simple vascular network. The vascular lumen is then established via formation of vacuoles, which eventually fuse with those of adjacent endothelial cells to generate a seamless tube with an intracellular lumen. To investigate the cellular architecture and the development of ISVs in detail, we have analysed the arrangement of endothelial cell junctions and have performed single cell live imaging. In contrast to previous reports, we find that endothelial cells are not arranged in a linear head-to-tail configuration but overlap extensively and form a multicellular tube, which contains an extracellular lumen. Our studies demonstrate that a number of cellular behaviours, such as cell divisions, cell rearrangements and dynamic alterations in cell-cell contacts, have to be considered when studying the morphological and molecular processes involved in ISV and endothelial lumen formation in vivo.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2008-03-18", "authors": ["YannickBlum", "Heinz-GeorgBelting", "ElinEllertsdottir", "LukasHerwig", "FlorianL\u00fcders", "MarkusAffolter"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.01.038"}
{"title": "Alteration of gene expression in rat colon mucosa after exercise.", "abstract": "The development of colon cancer is highly influenced by lifestyle factors such as nutrition and physical inactivity. Detailed biological mechanisms are thus far unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of regular treadmill exercise on gene expression in rat colon mucosa. For this purpose, 6-week-old male Wistar rats completed a stress-free voluntary treadmill exercise period of 12 weeks. Sedentary rats served as a control group. In the colon mucosa, steady-state mRNA expression levels of approximately 10,000 genes were compared between both groups by micro-array analysis (MWG rat 10K array). A total of 8846 mRNAs were detected above background level. Regular exercise led to a decreased expression of 47 genes at a threshold-factor of 2.0. Three genes were found to be up-regulated in the exercise group. The identified genes encode proteins involved in signal transduction (n=11), transport (n=8), immune system (n=7), cytoskeleton (n=6), protein targeting (n=6), metabolism (n=5), transcription (n=3) and vascularization (n=2). Among the genes regulated by regular exercise, the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2) seems to be of particular interest. Physical activity may protect against aberrant methylation by repressing the BHMT2 gene and thus contribute to a decreased risk of developing colon cancer. We have also identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) and calcium-independent phospholipase a2 (iPL-A2), all of them with markedly reduced transcript levels in the mucosa of active rats. In summary, our experiment presents the first gene expression pattern in rat colon mucosa following regular treadmill activity and represents an important step in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the preventive effect of physical activity on the development of colon cancer.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2008-03-18", "authors": ["KBuehlmeyer", "FDoering", "HDaniel", "BKindermann", "TSchulz", "HMichna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2007.04.002"}

Limited bone-forming or resorbing surfaces were identified on the malleus. As compared with the malleus, the percentage area of the resorbing surface and the vascular canal openings were higher on the incus and stapes, especially on the long process (Crus longum) of the incus and the neck of the stapes for both males and females. The percentage area occupied by the resorbing surface of the long process of the incus and the neck of the stapes correlated with that of the vascular canal openings. We consider that the malleus maintained the stable condition, while the long process of the incus and the neck of the stapes demonstrated marked bone resorption. We suppose that the bone erosion may be related to the vascularization in these regions.

The understanding of BTSCs has been greatly advanced by knowledge of neural progenitor/stem cells (NPSCs), which are multipotent and self-renewing precursor cells for neurons and glia. In this article, the authors summarize evidence that genetic mutations that deregulate asymmetric cell division by affecting cell polarity, spindle orientation, or cell fate determinants may result in the conversion of NPSCs to BTSCs. In addition, they review evidence that BTSCs and normal NPSCs may reside in similar vascularized microenvironments, where similar evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways control their proliferation.

We show that there was a significant decrease in bone marrow DA content and an increase in EPC mobilization in tumor-bearing mice associated with tumor neovascularization. DA treatment of tumor-bearing mice inhibited EPC mobilization and tumor growth through its D2 receptors, as DA treatment failed to inhibit EPC mobilization in tumor-bearing mice treated with a specific DA D2 receptor antagonist and in tumor-bearing mice lacking the D2 receptor. In addition, we found that DA, through D2 receptors, exerted its inhibitory effect on EPC mobilization through suppression of VEGFA-induced ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 synthesis.

{"title": "Recovery of liver perfusion after focal outflow obstruction and liver resection.", "abstract": "Live liver donation requires extended liver resection in the donor with transection of the middle hepatic vein. This leads to focal outflow obstruction in the remnant liver or the partial graft. This study was designed to characterize the pathophysiological correlate of focal outflow obstruction in a small-for-size liver and its course of recovery in a rat model.\nLigation of the right median hepatic vein was combined with 50% hepatectomy. Microcirculation was visualized by orthogonal polarization spectroscopy after each operative step and before killing on days 1, 2, and 7. Histologic evaluation included morphological assessment, immunohistochemical determination of proliferation using BrdU, and laminin and von Willebrand factor expression, which both indicate vascularization of sinusoids.\nAfter ligation of the right median hepatic vein, congestion was visible and no sinusoidal blood flow was detected in the obstruction zone. By day 1 confluent centrilobular necrosis developed. Sinusoidal perfusion in the obstruction zone recovered partially. Many dilated vascularized sinusoidal canals connecting the obstruction zone with the normal zone were visible. Proliferative activity in the obstruction zone was markedly reduced compared with the normal zone. By day 7, liver parenchyma in the obstruction zone looked normal as did sinusoidal perfusion. In the border zone, few dilated vascular canals were apparent.\nConfluent centrilobular necrosis in the early postoperative phase, resulting from focal outflow obstruction, may be crucial for the development of a small-for-size syndrome. The exclusion of the outflow-obstructed zone from the functional liver mass during preoperative radiological risk assessment seems to be the logical consequence.

At postnatal day (p)12, rat pups received intravitreous injections of a neutralizing antibody to VEGF or control nonimmune rat IgG in one eye and were returned to oxygen cycling until p14, at which time they were placed into room air. At p18 (time of maximal IVNV) or p25 (time point in regression), animals were sacrificed. Their retinas were dissected, flat mounted, and stained with Alexa-isolectin for fluorescence microscopy. IVNV was measured as number of clock hours involved in injected VEGF antibody and control eyes. Mean clock hours of IVNV, avascular/total retinal areas and capillary densities within vascularized retinas were determined in injected eyes of control and treatment groups. Mean clock hours of IVNV in fellow noninjected eyes from control and treatment groups were analyzed by Student's t-tests to assess possible crossover effects from systemic absorption of antibody. Eyes from p13 rat pups were sectioned for immunohistochemistry or analyzed for VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) phosphorylation by western blot. Free retinal VEGF at p13, one day following injections, was measured by ELISA.\nNeutralizing antibody to VEGF at 25 ng and 50 ng caused a modest but significant inhibition of IVNV compared to IgG injected controls at p18, but only the 50 ng dose decreased IVNV compared to control at p25 (one-way ANOVA p=0.003; posthoc Bonferroni t-test p=0.003). Neither dose caused a significant difference in avascular/total retinal area at p18 compared to control. However, at p25, the 50 ng dose caused a significant reduction in avascular/total retinal area compared to the 25 ng dose (ANOVA p=0.038; posthoc Student's t-test p=0.038). There was no difference in avascular/total retinal area between IgG and the 25 ng dose. At p13, qualitative analysis of immunohistochemical sections of retina showed the 50 ng dose of VEGF antibody reduced VEGFR2 phosphorylation within the retina and around blood vessels. Also at p13, there was a significant increase in free intraretinal VEGF protein in eyes that had been treated with 50 ng dose of VEGF antibody compared to IgG injected control (Student's t-test p=0.042). There were no differences in capillary densities in the vascularized retinas between eyes injected with the 50 ng dose of VEGF antibody and IgG control. There was also no difference in weight gain between treated and control groups.\nNeutralizing antibody to VEGF at a 50 ng dose caused a significant and sustained reduction in IVNV without interfering with ongoing retinal vascularization in a rat model of ROP, whereas a lower dose of antibody did not. These data also suggest that compensatory regulatory mechanisms may lead to increased VEGF concentration after intravitreous injection of a neutralizing antibody to VEGF. Further study is necessary for safety and for determination of drug dose of VEGF antibody, since dose of treatment appears important and may vary among infants with severe ROP.

We exploit the self-organizing capacity of cells and tissues to construct functional living structures of prescribed shape. In our technology, multicellular spheroids (bio-ink particles) are placed into biocompatible environment (bio-paper) by the use of a three-dimensional delivery device (bio-printer). Our approach mimics early morphogenesis and is based on the realization that the genetic control of developmental patterning through self-assembly involves physical mechanisms. Three-dimensional tissue structures are formed through the postprinting fusion of the bio-ink particles, in analogy with early structure-forming processes in the embryo that utilize the apparent liquid-like behavior of tissues composed of motile and adhesive cells. We modeled the process of self-assembly by fusion of bio-ink particles, and employed this novel technology to print extended cellular structures of various shapes. Functionality was tested on cardiac constructs built from embryonic cardiac and endothelial cells. The postprinting self-assembly of bio-ink particles resulted in synchronously beating solid tissue blocks, showing signs of early vascularization, with the endothelial cells organized into vessel-like conduits.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "In vivo pulmonary tissue engineering: contribution of donor-derived endothelial cells to construct vascularization.", "abstract": "Intrapulmonary engraftment of engineered lung tissues could provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of pediatric and adult pulmonary diseases. In working toward this goal, we report here on in vivo generation of vascularized pulmonary tissue constructs utilizing the subcutaneous Matrigel plug model. Mixed populations of murine fetal pulmonary cells (FPCs) containing epithelial, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated from the lungs of embryonic day 17.5 fetuses. FPCs were admixed to Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the anterior abdominal wall of adult C57/BL6 mice to facilitate in vivo pulmonary tissue construct formation. Vascularization was enhanced by placing fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-loaded polyvinyl sponges into the hydrogel. After 1 week, routine histology and immunohistochemical staining for donor-derived epithelial cells and ECs as well as analysis of patent vasculature in the constructs following tail vein injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran were performed. In the Matrigel-only controls, some level of host infiltrate, but no measurable vascularization, was detected. In the presence of FPCs, the constructs contained ductal epithelial structures and patent vasculature. In the absence of FPCs, exogenous FGF2 induced the formation of numerous patent blood vessels throughout the entire constructs; in combination with FPCs, it resulted in enhanced capillary density and abundant interfacing between developing epithelial and vascular structures. The significant findings of this study are that distal pulmonary epithelial differentiation (as assessed by the expression of prosurfactant protein C) can be maintained in vivo and that donor-derived ECs contribute to the formation of patent vessels that interface tightly with ductal epithelial structures.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "In vivo development and long-term survival of engineered adipose tissue depend on in vitro precultivation strategy.", "abstract": "One strategy of adipose tissue engineering is to transplant adipocytes or adipocyte precursor cells in combination with polymeric materials. However, a satisfying formation of fat tissue and its long-term survival still remain major problems. There is increasing evidence that treatment of the cells prior to implantation plays a critical role in the success of adipose tissue growth. In a previous study, we established a model system based on 3T3-L1 cells that allows for reproducible engineering of mature, coherent adipose tissues in vitro. We utilized this model system in the current study and systematically investigated the long-term in vivo development of cellular constructs with varying stages of adipogenic development at the time point of implantation. Blank polyglycolic acid fiber meshes, scaffolds seeded with uninduced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and cell-polymer constructs precultivated under adipogenic conditions for 2, 9, or 35 days were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Histological analysis revealed that no fat formation occurred in constructs without adipogenic precultivation. Implantation of mature fat pads (35 days) resulted in adiponecrosis within the constructs. In contrast, implants with an immature phenotype at the time point of implantation (2 and 9 days) gave rise to vascularized, mature adipose tissue in vivo. Further, these engineered adipose tissues showed long-term survival in vivo over the whole investigation period of 24 weeks. The results of this study can contribute to the development of future clinical approaches as they give clear evidence which precultivation strategy promotes successful development and long-term survival of engineered adipose tissue.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a three-dimensional porous collagen scaffold may provide a useful strategy to promote vascularization of the engineered tissue in a controlled manner. To this end, we investigated whether immobilized VEGF could promote the invasion and assembly of endothelial cells (ECs) into the collagen scaffolds. We conjugated VEGF onto collagen scaffolds using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride chemistry, and measured the concentrations of immobilized VEGF in collagen scaffolds by direct VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We demonstrated that immobilized VEGF (relative to soluble VEGF) promoted the penetration and proliferation of ECs in the collagen scaffold, based on results of cell density analysis in histological sections, immunohistochemistry, XTT proliferation assay, glucose consumption and lactate production. Furthermore, we observed increased viability of ECs cultured in scaffolds with immobilized VEGF relative to soluble VEGF.

{"title": "Mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells in fracture healing and distraction osteogenesis.", "abstract": "Fracture healing and distraction osteogenesis (DO) are unique postnatal bone formation processes, and neovascularization is critically required for successful bone regeneration. We investigated endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization during bone regeneration, and the possible contribution of EPCs to increased vascularization and new bone formation, especially in DO.\nMouse tibia fracture and rat tibia DO models were used in this study. The proportion of EPCs among the peripheral and splenic mononuclear cells (MNCs) was determined by examining the endothelial lineage staining characteristics and EPC cell surface markers. Messenger RNA expression of molecules related to EPC mobilization and homing at the fracture site were analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. In the rat tibia DO model, we measured blood flow during DO, and determined the distribution of ex vivo-expanded and intravenously-infused EPCs.\nThe proportion of EPCs among the peripheral and splenic MNCs increased after fracture, peaked on post-fracture day 3, and returned to basal levels during the healing period. Messenger RNA expression of EPC mobilizing cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stem cell factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and stromal cell-derived factor-1, were upregulated at the fracture callus. The plasma VEGF levels peaked prior to the increase in the EPC proportion. Adhesion molecules involved in EPC homing were expressed at the fracture callus. In the DO model, the temporal pattern of the increase in the EPC proportion was similar to that in the fracture healing model, but the EPC proportion increased again during the distraction and consolidation phases. The distraction gap was relatively ischemic during the distraction phase and blood flow increased profusely later in the consolidation phase. The number of EPCs homing to the bone regeneration site in the DO model correlated with the number of transplanted EPCs in a dose-dependent manner.\nThese findings suggest that signals from the bone regeneration site mobilize EPCs from the bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.

We present seven 22q11.2 patients from multiple centers with sclerocornea, an eye finding previously unreported in the literature. Four boys and three girls were identified with sclerocornea, systemic DGS/VCFS findings, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-confirmed microdeletion at chromosome 22q11.2. FISH diagnosis was perinatal in six patients but at 2 years of age in one child. Sclerocornea was bilateral in five patients. Findings included descemetocele (five eyes), microophthalmos (one eye), iridocorneal adhesions (one bilateral case), and severe anterior segment dysgenesis (one eye). Two patients underwent bilateral corneal transplantation; another two were scheduled for possible unilateral transplant. Sclerocornea is a static congenital condition in which the cornea is opaque and vascularized and resembles the sclera. The novel finding of sclerocornea suggests that a genetic locus at 22q11.2 may be involved in anterior segment embryogenesis. In most of our patients, the diagnostic process was underway, but in one patient 22q11.2 deletion was not suspected until after the child had already been undergoing treatment for sclerocornea for 2 years. Sclerocornea should be added to the clinical manifestations of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

TSU-68 undergoes hepatic oxidation and glucuronidation. Incubation of TSU-68 with human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH resulted in the formation of three major metabolites: 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxyindolinone derivatives. The 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxylation followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with V(max)/K(m) values (an indicator of intrinsic clearance) of 13, 25, and 6 microl/min/mg, respectively. Of the 10 cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoforms examined, only CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 exhibited appreciable TSU-68 hydroxylation activity. Inhibition studies with alpha-naphthoflavone (a selective CYP1A2 inhibitor) and anti-CYP1A2 antibody also indicated the almost exclusive role of CYP1A2 in microsomal TSU-68 hydroxylation. Treatment of human hepatocytes with 10 microM TSU-68 resulted in a 28- to 140-fold increase in CYP1A1/2-mediated ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity. The protein levels of CYP1A2 were increased in TSU-68-treated hepatocytes, and those of CYP1A1, which were undetectable in control hepatocytes, were also increased to detectable levels in the TSU-68-treated hepatocytes. Thus, TSU-68 was shown to induce CYP1A1/2 expression, which was responsible for its hydroxylation. The observation that TSU-68 treatment resulted in a 10- to 45-fold increase in 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxylation directly demonstrated the autoinduced hydroxylation of TSU-68. In conclusion, TSU-68 has the potential to cause induction of its own CYP1A1/2-mediated oxidative metabolism in humans. This autoinductive effect provides a clear explanation for the clinically observed decrease in TSU-68 plasma concentrations during repeated administration of the drug.", "journal": "Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals", "date": "2008-03-07", "authors": ["RyuichiKitamura", "HisaeAsanoma", "SekioNagayama", "MasakiOtagiri"], "doi": "10.1124/dmd.107.019877"}
{"title": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase signaling promotes growth and vascularization of fibrosarcoma.", "abstract": "We hypothesized that signaling through multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK) pathways is essential for the growth and vascularization of soft-tissue sarcomas, which are malignant tumors derived from mesenchymal tissues. We tested this using HT-1080, NCI, and Shac fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines and anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx), a bacterial toxin that inactivates MKKs. Western blots confirmed that LeTx treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAPK in vitro. Although short treatments with LeTx only modestly affected cell proliferation, sustained treatment markedly reduced cell numbers. LeTx also substantially inhibited the extracellular release of angioproliferative factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-8, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Similar results were obtained with cell lines derived from malignant fibrous histiocytomas, leiomyosarcomas, and liposarcomas. In vivo, LeTx decreased MAPK activity and blocked fibrosarcoma growth. Growth inhibition correlated with decreased cellular proliferation and extensive necrosis, and it was accompanied by a decrease in tumor mean vessel density as well as a reduction in serum expression of angioproliferative cytokines. Vital imaging using high-resolution ultrasound enhanced with contrast microbubbles revealed that the effects of LeTx on tumor perfusion were remarkably rapid (<24 h) and resulted in a marked reduction of perfusion within the tumor but not in nontumor tissues. These results are consistent with our initial hypothesis and lead us to propose that MKK inhibition by LeTx is a broadly effective strategy for targeting neovascularization in fibrosarcomas and other similar proliferative lesions.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2008-03-06", "authors": ["YanDing", "Elissa ABoguslawski", "Bree DBerghuis", "John JYoung", "ZhongfaZhang", "KimHardy", "KyleFurge", "EricKort", "Arthur EFrankel", "Rick VHay", "James HResau", "Nicholas SDuesbery"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2229"}

Therapeutic materials were applied to 1.0 cm(2) excisional wounds on genetically diabetic (db/db) mice. Wound-healing kinetics and new tissue formation were studied at 9 and 21 days posttreatment. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to study vascularity and cellular proliferation (days 9 and 21), and collagen deposition was evaluated 21 days postwounding. In vitro, micronized allogenic dermis, when combined with PRP, absorbed nearly 50% of original platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor from platelets and stimulated fibroblast proliferation. In vivo, micronized dermis increased the formation of vascularized wound tissue by day 9. Freeze-dried PRP alone or in combination with micronized dermis increased wound tissue revascularization and proliferation compared with spontaneous healing. The increase in cell proliferation persisted until day 21 only when freeze-dried PRP was used in combination with micronized dermis.

However, its use as a dermal substitute has been hindered by slow cell penetration and vascularization. A novel paste formulation of this material was investigated for its potential role as a dermal substitute in full-thickness wounds. A porcine punch biopsy model was initially used to assess the integration of a wide range of material formulations. Selected formulations were then assessed further in a larger wound-chamber model. Paste formulations were compared with those of sheet and another commercially available dermal regeneration template. The porcine collagen paste became integrated into full-thickness wounds without rejection and without excessive inflammation. It was detected in wounds up to day 27 postimplantation. Porcine collagen paste was readily infiltrated by host cells by day 2 and supported migrating keratinocytes on its surface. Staining for endothelial cells indicated neovasculature formation as early as day 4 and functional newly formed microvessels were noted at day 7. This was comparable with neovascularization of an alternative and clinically proven dermal regeneration template and was significantly superior to the sheet material formulation at the same time points.

To test the function of T-cadherin in breast cancer, we inactivated the T-cadherin (Cdh13) gene in mice and evaluated tumor development and pathology after crossing the mutation into the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-polyoma virus middle T (PyV-mT) transgenic model.

In comparison with wild-type MMTV-PyV-mT controls, T-cadherin-deficient tumors are pathologically advanced and metastasize to the lungs. T-cadherin is a suggested binding partner for high molecular weight forms of the circulating, fat-secreted hormone adiponectin.

{"title": "Epicardial development in lamprey supports an evolutionary origin of the vertebrate epicardium from an ancestral pronephric external glomerulus.", "abstract": "The epicardium is the outer layer of the vertebrate heart. Both the embryonic epicardium and its derived mesenchyme are critical to heart development, contributing to the coronary vasculature and modulating the proliferation of the ventricular myocardium. The embryonic epicardium arises from an extracardiac, originally paired progenitor tissue called the proepicardium, a proliferation of coelomic cells found at the limit between the liver and the sinus venosus. Proepicardial cells attach to and spread over the cardiac surface giving rise to the epicardium. Invertebrate hearts always lack of epicardium, and no hypothesis has been proposed about the origin of this tissue and its proepicardial progenitor in vertebrates. We herein describe the epicardial development in a representative of the most basal living lineage of vertebrates, the agnathan Petromyzon marinus (lamprey). The epicardium in lampreys develops by migration of coelomic cells clustered in a paired structure at the roof of the coelomic cavity, between the pronephros and the gut. Later on, these outgrowths differentiate into the pronephric external glomerulus (PEG), a structure composed of capillary networks, mesangial cells, and podocytes. This observation is consistent with the conclusion that the primordia of the most anterior pair of PEG in agnathans have been retained and transformed into the proepicardium in gnathostomes. Glomerular progenitor cells are highly vasculogenic and probably allowed for the vascularization of a cardiac tube primarily devoid of coronary vessels.

Lack of oxygen stabilizes HIF-1, which in turn modulates the gene expression pattern to adapt cells to the hypoxic environment. Activation of HIF-1 is also detected in most solid tumors and supports tumor growth through the expression of target genes that are involved in processes like cell proliferation, energy metabolism, and oxygen delivery. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a chromatin-associated protein, which was shown to regulate transcription. Here we report that chronic myelogenous leukemia cells expressing small interfering RNA against PARP1, which were injected into wild-type mice expressing PARP1, showed tumor growth with increased levels of necrosis, limited vascularization, and reduced expression of GLUT-1. Of note, PARP1-deficient cells showed a reduced HIF-1 transcriptional activation that was dependent on PARP1 enzymatic activity. PARP1 neither influenced binding of HIF-1 to its hypoxic response element nor changed HIF-1alpha protein levels in hypoxic cells. However, PARP1 formed a complex with HIF-1alpha through direct protein interaction and coactivated HIF-1alpha-dependent gene expression.

{"title": "Experience-dependent changes in spatiotemporal properties of cutaneous inputs remodel somatosensory cortical maps following skin flap rotation.", "abstract": "Contiguous skin surfaces that tend to be synchronously stimulated are represented in neighbouring sectors of primary somatosensory maps. Moreover, neuronal receptive fields (RFs) are reshaped through ongoing competitive/cooperative interactions that segregate/desegregate inputs converging onto cortical neuronal targets. The present study was designed to evaluate the influence of spatio-temporal constraints on somatotopic map organization. A vascularized and innervated pedicle flap of the ventrum skin bearing nipples was rotated by 180 degrees . Electrophysiological maps of ventrum skin were elaborated in the same rats at 24 h after surgery and 2 weeks after parturition. Neurones with split RFs resulting from the surgical separation of formerly adjoining skin surfaces were more numerous in non-nursing than nursing rats. RFs that included newly adjacent skin surfaces on both sides of the scar line emerged in nursing rats, suggesting that the spatial contiguity of formerly separated skin surfaces induced a fusion of their cortical representations through nursing-induced stimulation. In addition, nursing-dependent inputs were found to reincorporate the rotated skin flap representation in an updated topographical organization of the cortical map. A skin territory including recipient and translocated skin areas was costimulated for 7 h, using a brushing device. Neural responses evoked by a piezoelectric-induced skin indentation before and after skin brushing confirmed the emergence of RFs crossing the scar line and contraction of non-brushed components of split RFs.

All patients showed areas of abnormal echostructure suspicious for neoplastic lesions. On the basis of CEUS, a time/intensity curve of the suspected area was compared to that of a normal-appearing distant area of the gland and to the results of biopsy of the hypoechoic area.\nAT CEUS TWO DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF ENHANCEMENT WERE IDENTIFIED AND CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT: pattern 1 characterized by a rapid rise in the time/intensity curve of the suspected area compared with the normal gland. Two out of six patients had this pattern and biopsy showed cancer in the biopsied area. Pattern 2 was characterized by a similar rise in the time/intensity curve of the suspected area compared with the normal gland. Four out of six patients had this pattern and biopsy showed prostatitis in the biopsied area.\nCEUS using second-generation contrast agent can on the basis of time/intensity curves show differences in vascularization in normal and pathological tissue. Evaluation of the two patterns seems to be useful for identifying areas requiring biopsy, particularly when peripheral hypoechoic areas are observed at TRUS.

MATERIALI E METODI: Sei pazienti consecutivi (et\u00e0 72\u201387 anni) con elevati valori di antigene prostatico specifico (\u22654\u00a0ng/ml) sono stati sottoposti a ecografia transrettale tradizionale seguita da ecografia con mezzo di contrasto. In ogni paziente sono state identificate le aree periferiche di alterata ecostruttura sospette per lesione neoplastica. Queste aree sono state valutate con ecografia con mezzo di contrasto mediante curve di intensit\u00e0/tempo. I dati ottenuti sono stati confrontati con la biopsia dell'area sospetta. RISULTATI: L'ecografia con mezzo di contrasto ha consentito di identificare due pattern distinti: pattern 1 caratterizzato da rapida elevazione della curva calcolata a livello della lesione rispetto all'intensit\u00e0 di impregnazione del parenchima adiacente. Due dei sei pazienti con questo pattern hanno dimostrato presenza di lesione neoplastica nell'area sottoposta a biopsia. Pattern 2 caratterizzato da scarsa elevazione della curva rispetto all'intensit\u00e0 dell'impregnazione del parenchima adiacente. I rimanenti 4 dei 6 pazienti esaminati avevano questo pattern e\u00a0l'area bioptizzata ha dimostrato assenza di lesione neoplastica. CONCLUSIONI: L'ecografia con mezzo di contrasto di seconda generazione, attraverso le curve di intensit\u00e0/tempo pu\u00f2 identificare differenze di comportamento tra tessuto normale e patologico.

{"title": "Urocortin2 inhibits tumor growth via effects on vascularization and cell proliferation.", "abstract": "The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor CRFR2 is expressed widely in peripheral tissues and in the vasculature, although its functional roles in those tissues have only recently begun to be elucidated. Previously we found that genetic deletion of CRFR2 resulted in profound postnatal hypervascularization in mice, characterized by both an increase in total vessel number and a dramatic increase in vessel diameter. These data strongly suggested that ligands for CRFR2 act to limit tissue vascularity, perhaps as a counterbalance to factors that promote neovascularization. Urocortin 2 (Ucn2) is a specific ligand for the CRFR2. We hypothesized that activation of CRFR2 by Ucn2 might thus suppress tumor vascularization and consequently limit tumor growth. Here, we show that viral-mediated expression of Ucn2 strikingly inhibits the growth and vascularization of Lewis Lung Carcinoma Cell (LLCC) tumors in vivo. Further, we found that this effect on tumor growth inhibition was independent of whether exposure to Ucn2 occurred before or after establishment of measurable tumors. In vitro, Ucn2 directly inhibited the proliferation of LLCC, suggesting that the tumor-suppressing effects of CRFR2 activation involve a dual mechanism of both a direct inhibition of tumor cell cycling and the suppression of tumor vascularization. These results establish that Ucn2 inhibits tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for CRFR2 ligands in clinical malignancies.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2008-03-01", "authors": ["ZhengrongHao", "YanHuang", "JakeCleman", "Ion SJovin", "Wylie WVale", "Tracy LBale", "Frank JGiordano"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0712366105"}

Glioma progression is strongly dependent on the development of a new vascular network that occurs primarily by angiogenesis. Hypoxia and genetic anomalies within a glioma trigger the angiogenic switch, thus upregulating angiogenic factors and downregulating antiangiogenic factors. The main factors indicative of angiogenesis are now well known, and more recently, differences based on grade and subtype have been reported. New data also indicate a potential role for postnatal vasculogenesis with bone marrow endothelial progenitors in addition to angiogenesis in tumor vascular development. All of these factors may have therapeutic implications. Antiangiogenic therapies are presently being developed; more than 80 trials are ongoing. Initial results indicate that epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, anti-metalloproteases, and thalidomide do not demonstrate strong anti-tumor activity. Thus, antiangiogenic agents combined with conventional therapies and second-generation antiangiogenic drugs for targeting multiple molecular pathways are presently being tested. Clinical experience also demonstrates the failure of conventional imaging to monitor these new approaches accurately.

Stem cells are a promising tool for tissue regeneration, thanks to their particular characteristics of proliferation, differentiation and plasticity. Several \"loci\" or \"niches\" within the adult human body are colonized by a significant number of stem cells. However, access to these potential collection sites often is a limiting point. The interaction with biomaterials is a further point that needs to be considered for the therapeutic use of stem cells. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have been demonstrated to answer all of these issues: access to the collection site of these cells is easy and produces very low morbidity; extraction of stem cells from pulp tissue is highly efficiency; they have an extensive differentiation ability; and the demonstrated interactivity with biomaterials makes them ideal for tissue reconstruction. SBP-DPSCs are a multipotent stem cell subpopulation of DPSCs which are able to differentiate into osteoblasts, synthesizing 3D woven bone tissue chips in vitro and that are capable to synergically differentiate into osteoblasts and endotheliocytes. Several studied have been performed on DPSCs and they mainly found that these cells are multipotent stromal cells that can be safety cryopreserved, used with several scaffolds, that can extensively proliferate, have a long lifespan and build in vivo an adult bone with Havers channels and an appropriate vascularization. A definitive proof of their ability to produce dentin has not been yet done.

After injection of red latex, the 1,2 ICSRA and its perforators were characterized and measured. Pedicle length and distal reach of the transposed 1,2 ICSRA pedicle was evaluated. We noted the relationship of the 1,2 ICSRA to the dorsal scaphoid branch of the radial artery.

The average pedicle length was 22.5 mm (range 15-31 mm), which permits its application for both dorsal and volar scaphoid. The relationship between the origin of the 1,2 ICSRA and the dorsal scaphoid branch was categorized into 3 types, including--separate, combined, and shared.

{"title": "A preliminary study on computerized lesion localization in MR mammography using 3D nMITR maps, multilayer cellular neural networks, and fuzzy c-partitioning.", "abstract": "Cellular neural networks (CNNs) are massively parallel cellular structures with learning abilities. They can be used to realize complex image processing applications efficiently and in almost real time. In this preliminary study, we propose a novel, robust, and fully automated system based on CNNs to facilitate lesion localization in contrast-enhanced MR mammography, a difficult task requiring the processing of a large number of images with attention paid to minute details. The data set consists of 1170 slices containing one precontrast and five postcontrast bilateral axial MR mammograms from 39 patients with 37 malignant and 39 benign mass lesions acquired using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with the following parameters: 3D FLASH sequence, TR/TE 9.80/4.76 ms, flip angle 250, slice thickness 2.5 mm, and 0.625 x 0.625 mm2 in-plane resolution. Six hundred slices with 21 benign and 25 malignant lesions of this set are used for training the CNNs; the remaining data are used for test purposes. The breast region of interest is first segmented from precontrast images using four 2D CNNs connected in cascade, specially designed to minimize false detections due to muscles, heart, lungs, and thoracic cavity. To identify deceptively enhancing regions, a 3D nMITR map of the segmented breast is computed and converted into binary form. During this process tissues that have low degrees of enhancements are discarded. To boost lesions, this binary image is processed by a 3D CNN with a control template consisting of three layers of 11 x 11 cells and a fuzzy c-partitioning output function. A set of decision rules extracted empirically from the training data set based on volume and 3D eccentricity features is used to make final decisions and localize lesions. The segmentation algorithm performs well with high average precision, high true positive volume fraction, and low false positive volume fraction with an overall performance of 0.93 +/- 0.05, 0.96 +/- 0.04, and 0.03 +/- 0.05, respectively (training: 0.93 +/- 0.04, 0.94 +/- 0.04, and 0.02 +/- 0.03; test: 0.93 +/- 0.05, 0.97 +/- 0.03, and 0.05 +/- 0.06). The lesion detection performance of the system is quite satisfactory; for the training data set the maximum detection sensitivity is 100% with false-positive detections of 0.28/lesion, 0.09/slice, and 0.65/case; for the test data set the maximum detection sensitivity is 97% with false-positive detections of 0.43/lesion, 0.11/slice, and 0.68/case. On the average, for a detection sensitivity of 99%, the overall performance of the system is 0.34/lesion, 0.10/slice, and 0.67/case. The system introduced does not require prior information concerning breast anatomy; it is robust and exceptionally effective for detecting breast lesions. The use of CNNs, fuzzy c-partitioning, volume, and 3D eccentricity criteria reduces false-positive detections due to artifacts caused by highly enhanced blood vessels, nipples, and normal parenchyma and artifacts from vascularized tissues in the chest wall due to oversegmentation. We hope that this system will facilitate breast examinations, improve the localization of lesions, and reduce unnecessary mastectomies, especially due to missed multicentric lesions and that almost real-time processing speeds achievable by direct hardware implementations will open up new clinical applications, such as making feasible quasi-automated MR-guided biopsies and acquisition of additional postcontrast lesion images to improve morphological characterizations.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2008-02-26", "authors": ["GokhanErtas", "H OzcanGulcur", "MehtapTunaci", "OnurOsman", "Osman NuriUcan"], "doi": "10.1118/1.2805477"}

We have studied the effect of adenovirus-mediated transfer of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MMP-2 in the human melanoma cell line A2058. The delivery of these double-stranded RNA molecules represents an efficient technology in silencing disease-causing genes with known sequences at the post-transcriptional level. siRNA against MMP-2 mRNA (Ad-MMP-2) was found to decrease MMP-2 protein expression and activity in melanoma cells as demonstrated by western blotting and gelatin zymography. Furthermore, infection of cells with Ad-MMP-2 inhibited cellular migration and invasion as indicated by spheroid and matrigel assays. We also observed dose-dependent suppression of vascular network formation in an angiogenesis assay. Finally, we developed a nude mouse spinal metastatic model to investigate the local effects of tumor metastasis. Intravenous tail vein injection with Ad-MMP-2 on days 5, 9 and 11 after tumor implantation resulted in complete retention of neurological function as compared to control and scrambled vector (Ad-SV)-treated groups that showed complete paraplegia by day 14+/-2 days.

Functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, optical imaging, and PET, provide indirect measures of the neural-induced vascular dynamics driving the blood parameters. Models connecting changes in vascular tone and oxygen consumption to observed changes in the blood parameters are needed to guide more quantitative physiological interpretation of these functional neuroimaging modalities. Effective lumped-parameter vascular balloon and Windkessel models have been developed for this purpose, but the lumping of the complex vascular network into a series of arterioles, capillaries, and venules allows only qualitative interpretation. We have therefore developed a parallel vascular anatomical network (VAN) model based on microscopically measurable properties to improve quantitative interpretation of the vascular response. The model, derived from measured physical properties, predicts baseline blood pressure and oxygen saturation distributions and dynamic responses consistent with literature. Furthermore, the VAN model allows investigation of spatial features of the dynamic vascular and oxygen response to neuronal activity.

At present there are no data available as to its possible influence on tumor angiogenesis, which is a major biological mechanism responsible for tumor growth and dissemination. It is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is crucial to a solid tumor's higher vascularization and development. To investigate the possible influence of melatonin on angiogenesis, we studied the effect of melatonin on endogenous VEGF expression in three human cancer cell lines (PANC-1, HeLa and A549 cells). In this study, we report that physiologic concentrations of melatonin have no obvious impact on the VEGF expression, whereas pharmacologic concentrations of melatonin suppress the VEGF mRNA and protein levels induced by hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)). Melatonin also decreases hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein levels, suggesting a role for transcription factor HIF-1 in the suppression of VEGF expression. The effect of pharmacologic concentrations of melatonin on VEGF and HIF-1alpha under normoxia is uncertain, which indicates that the regulatory mechanisms of VEGF in the absence or presence of CoCl(2) are different and other or additional transcription factors may be involved.

Upstream components of AKT signaling pathway such as PI3K, PTEN, and Ras are commonly mutated in many human cancers. Recently it is found that AKT plays an important role in regulating normal vascularization and pathological angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis when tumor reaches more than 1 mm in diameter. This review focuses on the role and potential mechanism of AKT signaling in regulating angiogenesis. Recent studies have shown that AKT activation is necessary and sufficient to regulate VEGF and HIF-1 expression in human cancer cells. VEGF and HIF-1 are potent inducers of angiogenesis. It was found that AKT activation induces VEGF and HIF-1 expression through its two downstream molecules HDM2 and p70S6K1. On the other hand, AKT transmits the upstream signals from growth factors, cytokines, heavy metals, and oncogenes for regulating VEGF and HIF-1 expression in human cancer cells. AKT activation and VEGF expression can be inhibited by different natural compounds used for cancer prevention.

However, mimicking in vitro the physiological complexity of vascularized tissue is a major obstacle, which possibly contributes to impaired healing in vivo. In higher organisms, native features including the vascular network, the lymphatic networks and interstitial flow promote both mass transport and organ development. Attempts to mimic those features in engineered tissues will lead to more clinically relevant cell-based therapies. Aside from current strategies promoting angiogenesis from the host, an alternative concept termed prevascularization is emerging. It aims at creating a biological vasculature inside an engineered tissue prior to implantation. This vasculature can rapidly anastamose with the host and enhances tissue survival and differentiation. Interestingly, growing evidence supports a role of the vasculature in regulating pattern formation and tissue differentiation. Thus, prevascularized tissues also benefit from an intrinsic contribution of their vascular system to their development. From those early attempts are emerging a body of principles and strategies to grow and maintain, in vitro, those self-assembled biological vascular networks.

In particular, vasculogenic mimicry seems to be different from mosaic blood vessels, where tumor cells form a part of the surface of the vessel while the remaining part is covered by endothelium. In this case, tumor cells in apparent contact with the lumen do not show an endothelial phenotype. More recently, vasculogenic mimicry was proposed to occur in patients with multiple myeloma due to bone marrow macrophages. Herein, all these data are, for the first time, discussed critically in comparison to cancer stem cells-which show high trans-differentiative capacity-and bone-marrow derived stem cells.

Therefore, we investigated whether pCSCs serve as progenitors for tumor vasculogenesis. Herein, we report that in the pCSC-derived tumors, most blood vessels were derived from pCSCs. Some pCSCs constitutively expressed vasculogenic receptor VEGFR-2, which can be up-regulated by hypoxia and angiogenesis-promoting cytokines, such as GM-CSF, Flt3 ligand, and IL-13. The pCSCs are much more potent in tumor vasculogenesis than the differentiated tumor monocytic cells (TMCs) from the same tumor, which had comparable or even higher capacity to produce some vascular growth factors, suggesting that the potent tumor vasculogenesis of pCSCs is associated with their intrinsic stem-like property. Consistently tumor vasculogenesis was also observed in human cancers such as cervical cancer and breast cancer and xenograft lymphoma.

During surgery, an intramedullary, poorly vascularized, dark gray lesion was detected and was totally removed. One year after surgery, no recurrence was encountered and the patient showed significant improvement.\nIt had previously been hypothesized that intramedullary melanotic schwannomas originate from the rostral components of the neural tube. This case presented a different localization with respect to the previously described cases, all localized in the cervical or high thoracic tracts, and thus uncertainties are raised about the previous hypotheses.

To avoid flap irradiation and reduce wound-healing morbidity, a treatment strategy using negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for temporary wound coverage during brachytherapy followed by delayed flap reconstruction was used in 3 previously irradiated sarcoma patients. NPWT was continued after brachytherapy catheter removal to stimulate vascularization, granulation, and wound contraction. Flap reconstructions were performed after the adequacy of the resection margins was pathologically confirmed and the wound bed appeared grossly vascularized. Prior to reconstruction, 2 patients required additional excision of positive or close permanent-section surgical margins. There were no major wound-healing complications during 9-18 months' follow-up. Staged closure using this approach may have advantages over immediate flap reconstruction in some sarcoma patients. Potential advantages include avoiding flap irradiation, reducing wound size and magnitude of the reconstructive procedure, and ensuring tumor-free surgical margins before definitive reconstruction.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2008-02-19", "authors": ["LiorHeller", "Matthew TBallo", "Janice NCormier", "Scott DOates", "Charles EButler"], "doi": "10.1097/01.sap.0000258956.66990.9a"}
{"title": "Estrogen-induced redox sensitive Id3 signaling controls the growth of vascular cells.", "abstract": "In this study, we investigated a mechanism by which estrogen-induced oxidants control endothelial cell differentiation into tubelike structures via redox sensitive signaling molecule Id3. Using a matrigel cell culture, we determined whether superoxide or hydrogen peroxide signaled estrogen-induced tube formation. Overexpression of the superoxide scavenger MnSOD and the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase inhibited tube formation in estrogen treated endothelial cells. Since tube formation on matrigel is not specific for endothelial cells, we verified our results in a co-culture model that better represents tube formation in vivo. Antioxidants ebselen and N-acetylcysteine as well as overexpression of MnSOD and catalase inhibited tube formation in estrogen exposed endothelial cells co-cultured with fibroblasts. We previously showed that estrogen-induced mitochondrial oxidants depended on the cytoskeleton so we tested tube formation dependence on the cytoskeleton. Estrogen-induced tube formation was inhibited by the actin cytoskeleton disruptor cytochalasin D and the microtubule destabilizer colchicine. Estrogen increased Id3 phosphorylation which was reduced by catalase and N-acetylcysteine treatments. We determined the functional role of Id3 in tube formation by RNA intereference and showed Id3 siRNA to inhibit tube formation in estrogen exposed cells. The major novel findings presented here are that: (i) estrogen-induced tube formation requires the presence of Id3, a member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcriptional factors and (ii) estrogen increases Id3 phosphorylation via a redox-dependent process. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate Id3 to be an important signaling molecule in estrogen stimulated vascularization and may serve as a therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of vasculoproliferative disorders.", "journal": "Atherosclerosis", "date": "2008-02-19", "authors": ["QuentinFelty", "NicolePorther"], "doi": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2007.12.048"}

{"title": "Evaluation of equine laminar vein function: harvesting, dissection and the use of functional methods to distinguish between veins and arteries.", "abstract": "Pharmacological evaluation of the unique equine laminar microvasculature is crucial to understanding its role in health and in diseases such as laminitis. However, separating the distinctive characteristics of arterial versus venous components of this complex vascular network has previously proved to be extremely difficult. Encased in a hard hoof capsule, isolation of individual blood vessels presents a considerable challenge. Exacerbating this difficulty, the laminar venous network is adapted to sustain high intravascular pressures and consequently has thickened walls, making the normally straightforward visual distinction between arteries and veins problematic. Here we describe a novel harvesting and dissection method coupled with a functional analysis procedure that facilitates distinction of arteries and veins.\nLaminar tissue was recovered from the hoof of euthanized, clinically normal horses by dissection at the coronary band and stored in cold Krebs-Henseleit physiological salt solution prior to further dissection in the laboratory to remove 2 mm segments of vessels 100-500 microm in diameter. Active length tension measurements were made to evaluate optimal conditions for experimentation, and based on the differences in contractility and appearance, an experimental protocol was set up to allow a) initial distinction between arteries and veins and b) in vitro pharmacological evaluation.\nActive length tension studies clearly revealed the presence of two populations of vessels distinguished by either a large or a lower maximal contraction that subsequent histological evaluation confirmed to be arteries and veins respectively. Functional distinction using relative contractility to 60 mM potassium salt solution then demonstrated equine laminar veins to have increased sensitivity to the agonist endothelin 1 (ET-1) compared to arteries.\nIn vitro evaluation of laminar vessels is possible despite anatomical obstacles. Furthermore, a clear distinction can be made between laminar veins and arteries using functional characteristics providing vessels of a similar size range are selected. Utilising these novel procedures, investigators can unambiguously analyse the pharmacological characteristics of equine laminar veins and arteries to decipher the physiological mechanisms responsible for the control of laminar blood flow.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2008-02-19", "authors": ["John AKeen", "ChrisHillier", "Bruce CMcGorum", "DavidBunton", "Jane ENally"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2007.10.005"}

While displaying some glial properties, the latter shall not - by definition - be either reducible to or part of any conventional glioma type. We report on clinicopathologic correlations in a case of astroblastoma involving an extensive rhabdoid phenotype of tumor cells. The male patient was operated on at the age of 53 and 59 years for a left parietal tumor measuring 5.8 cm in diameter at the first presentation. On magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, both the primary and its recurrence were discrete, highly vascularized, and contrast-enhancing. The second surgery was complemented with radiotherapy of 66 Gy, followed by chemotherapy with Temozolomide. Twelve years into clinical history, the patient has stable minimal residual disease at the age of 65. A review of pathology samples from both surgeries showed well-differentiated astroblastoma according to current standards, with an MIB-1 labeling index of 1% and 4%, respectively. Neither of the specimens involved cellular anaplasia, overt mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, or palisading necrosis. Most tumor cells harbored paranuclear filamentous rhabdoid inclusions that were immunostained for vimentin and, in part, also for GFAP. No polyantigenic reactivity was observed. This example contributes another facet to the spectrum of the so-called composite rhabdoid tumors. Involving a low-grade parent neoplasm, it also further substantiates the incipient perception that the rhabdoid phenotype neither is a peculiar but nonspecific convergence point of anaplastic evolution, nor are such lesions indiscriminately bound for a relentless course.", "journal": "Pathology, research and practice", "date": "2008-02-19", "authors": ["Ali-RezaFathi", "EvaNovoa", "MarwanEl-Koussy", "AndreasKappeler", "LuigiMariani", "IstvanVajtai"], "doi": "10.1016/j.prp.2007.12.003"}

Other cellular markers, such as Akt activation and MYCN amplification, are also associated with poor prognosis in NB; therefore, we sought to determine the role of N-myc in the regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/VEGF pathway. PI3K inhibition, using small-molecule inhibitors or phosphatase and tensin homolog adenovirus, led to decreased levels of VEGF mRNA and/or protein by reducing phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and attenuating hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha expression. Moreover, PI3K inhibition decreased levels of N-myc expression in MYCN-amplified cells. To further clarify the importance of N-myc as a target of PI3K in VEGF regulation, we inhibited N-myc expression by siRNA transfection. MYCN siRNA significantly blocked VEGF secretion, irrespective of serum conditions, in MYCN-amplified NB cells; this effect was enhanced when combined with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. Interestingly, in cells with low-N-myc expression, MYCN siRNA reduction of VEGF secretion was only effective with MYCN overexpression or insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation. Our results show that N-myc plays an important role in the PI3K-mediated VEGF regulation in NB cells.

The rat insulin promoter (RIP)-T-antigen (Tag) is a well characterized transgenic mouse model of multistage pancreatic beta-cell tumorigenesis. Also, the role of neutrophils in RIP-Tag angiogenic switching, as assessed by systemic ablation using anti-Gr1 antibodies at different stages of tumor progression, has been recently described. Here, we show that early treatment of RIP-Tag mice with anti-Bv8 antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in the number of angiogenic islets relative to control antibody-treated mice, implicating Bv8 in the angiogenic switch during neoplasia. Histological analysis showed a significant reduction in vascular surface areas in hyperplastic and angiogenic lesions in pancreatic islets from anti-Bv8-treated mice. Anti-Bv8 treatment also inhibited the mobilization and homing of CD11b+Gr1+ cells to the peripheral blood and the emerging neoplastic lesions. However, anti-Bv8 treatment had no effect on tumor vascularization or burden when initiated at later stages of tumor progression. The stage-dependent efficacy of anti-Bv8 treatment appears remarkably similar to that reported after neutrophil ablation, suggesting that Bv8 is an important mediator of neutrophil-dependent angiogenesis in this transgenic model.

To evaluate whether glycolysis does effectively predominate for ATP supply and to identify the underlying biochemical mechanisms, the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) fluxes, ATP/ADP ratio, phosphorylation potential, and expression and activity of relevant energy metabolism enzymes were determined in multi-cellular tumor spheroids, as a model of human solid tumors. In HeLa and Hek293 young-spheroids, the OxPhos flux and cytochrome c oxidase protein content and activity were similar to those observed in monolayer cultured cells, whereas the glycolytic flux increased two- to fourfold; the contribution of OxPhos to ATP supply was 60%. In contrast, in old-spheroids, OxPhos, ATP content, ATP/ADP ratio, and phosphorylation potential diminished 50-70%, as well as the activity (88%) and content (3 times) of cytochrome c oxidase. Glycolysis and hexokinase increased significantly (both, 4 times); consequently glycolysis was the predominant pathway for ATP supply (80%). These changes were associated with an increase (3.3 times) in the HIF-1alpha content. After chronic exposure, both oxidative and glycolytic inhibitors blocked spheroid growth, although the glycolytic inhibitors, 2-deoxyglucose and gossypol (IC(50) of 15-17 nM), were more potent than the mitochondrial inhibitors, casiopeina II-gly, laherradurin, and rhodamine 123 (IC(50) > 100 nM).

Placental growth factor (PlGF), acting through vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, may be among those signals. There is a steep rise in circulating PlGF during normal pregnancy, which is repressed in gravidas who develop preeclampsia. PlGF-deficiency in mice impairs adipose vascularization and development. Here we studied young-adult PlGF-deficient (PlGF(-/-)) and wild-type mice on a high-fat diet in the nongravid state and at embryonic day (E) 13.5 or E18.5 of gestation. Litter size and weight were normal, but E18.5 placentas were smaller in PlGF(-/-) pregnancies. PlGF(-/-) mice showed altered intraadipose dynamics, with the following: 1) less blood vessels and fewer brown, uncoupling protein (UCP)-1-positive, adipocytes in white sc and perigonadal fat compartments and 2) white adipocyte hypertrophy. The mRNA expression of beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha, and UCP-1 was decreased accordingly. Moreover, PlGF(-/-) mice showed hyperinsulinemia. Pregnancy-associated changes were largely comparable in PlGF(-/-) and wild-type dams. They included expanded sc fat compartments and adipocyte hypertrophy, whereas adipose expression of key angiogenesis/adipogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma(2)) and thermogenesis (beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha, and UCP-1) genes was down-regulated; circulating insulin levels gradually increased during pregnancy. In conclusion, reduced adipose vascularization in PlGF(-/-) mice impairs adaptive thermogenesis in favor of energy storage, thereby promoting insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.

Metformin is known to work in part through the activation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, especially under stress conditions where biosynthetic pathways are blocked by the phosphorylation of downstream AMPK substrates. Stimulation of AMPK by metformin resulted in a significant repression of cell proliferation and active MAPK1/2 in both estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) negative (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435) and positive (MCF-7, T47D) human breast cancer cell lines. However, when ERalpha negative MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with metformin, they demonstrated increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in an AMPK dependent manner; while the ERalpha positive MCF-7 cells did not. Systemic therapy with metformin was tested for efficacy in an orthotopic model of ERalpha negative breast cancer performed in athymic nude mice. Surprisingly, metformin therapy significantly improved tumorigenic progression as compared to untreated controls.

In recent years, several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that notch-signalling functions as a negative feedback mechanism downstream of the VEGF-signalling pathway that acts to finely shape the vascular network. Notch activation by the Jagged-1 and Delta-like 4 ligands regulates different steps of blood vessel development ranging from proliferation and survival of endothelial cells, to vessel branching and arterial-venous differentiation. In addition, heterotypic notch signalling from endothelial cells to pericytes is critical for vessel stabilization and maturation. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that blocking the notch pathway can delay tumour growth. Unexpectedly however, tumour growth inhibition by Notch was caused by an increased number of non-functional vessels, which resulted in poor tumour perfusion. This approach of modulating notch signalling, combined with the extended knowledge acquired on the basic vascular role of notch signalling, will aid the development of treatments targetting human pathologies such as tissue ischaemia and solid tumour formation.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2008-02-08", "authors": ["Richard C ASainson", "Adrian LHarris"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-008-9098-0"}

Nine of the IUGR group had normal umbilical FVWs (NED), nine had abnormal patterns but positive end-diastolic velocities (PED) and 12 had absent or reversed end-diastolic velocities (AED). Placental position was assessed as being posterior, anterior or lateral. 3D power Doppler indices related to placental perfusion (vascularization index (VI), vascularization flow index (VFI) and flow index (FI)) were obtained from five different sampling sites in each placenta.\nVI, VFI and FI were not significantly dependent on GA or placental position. VI and VFI were significantly lower in PED and AED cases compared with controls, while FI was reduced in the AED group only. VI and VFI showed high variability between different sampling sites within each placenta, while the variability of FI was much lower.\n3D power Doppler sonography can provide new insights into placental pathophysiology. FI, which identifies the most severe cases of placental impairment, appears to be the most reliable index because of its low intraplacental variability.

Following transplantation of allogeneic abdominal aortic segments in mice, aortic grafts were retransplanted into either immunodeficient or syngeneic recipients. Retransplantation of grafts from immunocompetent into immunodeficient mice as early as 2 days after the primary transplant resulted in intimal proliferation and obstruction of the graft lumen 30 days after the primary transplant. In contrast, retransplantation of the grafts into donor syngeneic B10 recipients within 7 days did not result in the development of transplant arteriosclerosis.

According to the most relevant concept of ageing, age-associated malfuction results from physiological accumulation of irreparable damage to biomolecules as an unavoidable side effect of normal metabolism. More than a decade after the free radical theory of ovarian ageing, biological and clinical research supporting the involvement of oxidative injuries in follicle ageing is discussed. Looking for the aetiology of oxidative stress, we consider the effect of ageing on ovarian and follicular vascularization. Then, we propose a potential role of advanced glycation end-products known to be involved in the physiological ageing of most tissues and organs.

Several studies have attempted to assess the nature of modifications that occur in the vascular network of such a flap after transfer. Although these investigations have interesting conclusions, the majority of them were based only on indirect evaluations. The aim of this study was to detect, by histological and statistical analysis, the morphostructural changes that occurred in fasciocutaneous free flaps transferred to the cephalic region or to the lower limb. Patients were enrolled in this study only when neither local inflammatory reactions nor systemic diseases were observed at the time of biopsy. Six patients consented to undergo biopsy at both the donor and the recipient area of a previously transferred fasciocutaneous free flap. Three flaps were used for facial reconstruction, and three others for lower limb reconstruction. Standard staining and immunohistochemical investigations were performed. The sections were also analysed by specific software. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the student's t-test and Fisher's test. In five out of six transferred flaps (83%), there was increased microvascularity compared to the donor area. It was correlated to the neoangiogenesis in the dermal layer of the flaps. In five recipient sites there were more new vessels. In particular, a higher score of angiogenesis was observed both in the cheek (one flap) and in the non weight-bearing area of the foot (two flaps) (P<0.001).

Here we studied the role of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) in experimentally-induced angiogenesis in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri (Tunicata, Ascidiacea). The circulatory system of B. schlosseri is composed of two distinct, but interconnected regions: a plot of sinuses and lacunae which line the body, and a transparent, macroscopic extracorporeal vascular network. The vessels of the extracorporeal vasculature are morphologically inverted in comparison to the vasculature in vertebrates: they consist of a single layer of ectodermally-derived cells with the basal lamina lining the lumen of the vessel. We found that when the peripheral circulatory system of a colony is surgically removed, it can completely regenerate within 24 to 48 h and this regeneration is dependent on proper function of the VEGF pathway: siRNA-mediated knockdown of the VEGFR blocked vascular regeneration, and interfered with vascular homeostasis. In addition, a small molecule, the VEGFR kinase inhibitor PTK787/ZK222584, phenocopied the siRNA knockdown in a reversible manner.

Vascularized bone grafts can be used to increase the bone fusion rates in the presence of scaphoid pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis. On a note of caution, it must be mentioned, though, that such a procedure in the presence of avascular necrosis of the proximal pole with destruction of cartilage can lead to premature radiocarpal arthritis, because a friction-free gliding in the area of the proximal scaphoid pole is no longer ensured as a result of the lacking cartilage cover.We confronted these problems in a 20-year-old male patient with avascular necrosis of the proximal scaphoid bone pole and destruction of the corresponding scaphoidal cartilage cover. We transplanted a free vascularized cartilage-bone graft from the medial femoral condyle, which was adapted in form and size to the proximal scaphoid bone pole with corresponding cartilage cover and was connected to the radial vascular bundle.

Plain radiographic evaluation with anteroposterior radiographs showed that mandibular symmetry increased and normooclusive closure of incisive teeth was achieved after surgery and retained in the postoperative period. Radiographs taken 1 year after surgery demonstrated that there was a slight relapse (1 mm) to the right side in the mandible when the results were compared with early postoperative ones. Postoperative three-dimensional computed tomographic evaluation of bony structures 3 months after operation showed that the transferred bone retained its volume. Sequential bone scintigraphies, performed to assess the vascularity of the grafts 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year after the operation, demonstrated the viability of transferred vascularized bone graft. The temporalis muscle osteofascial flap is a reliable method for mandibular reconstruction. It lessens the operative time, lessens surgical team labor, minimizes postoperative morbidity and discomfort, minimizes the hospital stay period, and minimizes financial expenses without renouncing the bone-healing capacity and increases aesthetic outcome by camouflaging the donor site scar in scalp and minimizing the facial scarring.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2008-01-25", "authors": ["Halil IbrahimCanter", "AycanKayikcioglu", "BanuSaglam-Aydinatay", "Pinar OzgenKiratli", "KemalBenli", "TulinTaner", "YucelErk"], "doi": "10.1097/scs.0b013e3181577b6e"}

Patient demographics, nonunion characteristics, complications, and long-term outcome based on radiographic and clinical parameters were analyzed. Nine free transfers and 3 pedicled flaps were used for a total of 12 nonunion sites in 11 patients. The average age of the patient population was 49 years (21-64 years). The location of the nonunion sites were femur (n = 4), tibia (n = 2), humerus (n = 3), clavicle (n = 2), and radius (n = 1). The nonunion sites were secondary to traumatic fractures complicated by osteomyelitis (n = 10) and tumor extirpation (n = 2). The time period of nonunion prior to the use of vascularized periosteal bone graft ranged from 10 months to 23 years (median = 23 months). All patients had previous attempts at debridement with or without antibiotic bead placement, and all underwent rigid fixation with or without nonvascularized bone grafts prior to vascularized grafting. Following flap placement, 9 (75%) of the nonunion sites healed primarily without complication at an average period of 3.8 months (2-7 months). Two nonunions healed secondarily following hardware modification. There was only 1 flap failure secondary to arterial thrombosis, resulting in a below-knee amputation.

We report that c-kit-positive cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) activated with insulin-like growth factor 1 and hepatocyte growth factor before their injection in proximity of the site of occlusion of the left coronary artery in rats, engrafted within the host myocardium forming temporary niches. Subsequently, CPCs divided and differentiated into endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and, to a lesser extent, into cardiomyocytes. The acquisition of vascular lineages appeared to be mediated by the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, which promoted the synthesis and secretion of stromal-derived factor 1 from hypoxic coronary vessels. Stromal-derived factor 1 was critical in the conversion of CPCs to the vascular fate. CPCs formed conductive and intermediate-sized coronary arteries together with resistance arterioles and capillaries. The new vessels were connected with the primary coronary circulation, and this increase in vascularization more than doubled myocardial blood flow in the infarcted myocardium. This beneficial effect, together with myocardial regeneration attenuated postinfarction dilated myopathy, reduced infarct size and improved function. In conclusion, locally delivered activated CPCs generate de novo coronary vasculature and may be implemented clinically for restoration of blood supply to the ischemic myocardium.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2008-01-25", "authors": ["JochenTillmanns", "MarcelloRota", "ToruHosoda", "YuMisao", "GraziaEsposito", "ArantxaGonzalez", "SerenaVitale", "CarolaParolin", "SaoriYasuzawa-Amano", "JohnMuraski", "AntonellaDe Angelis", "NicoleLecapitaine", "Robert WSiggins", "MariaLoredo", "ClaudiaBearzi", "RobertoBolli", "KonradUrbanek", "AnnarosaLeri", "JanKajstura", "PieroAnversa"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0706315105"}

At the sites of extraocular muscle insertion, the vascularization of the stroma extended to the peripheral cornea, and the limbal epithelium was thin with its basal stratum made up by clear cuboidal cells. In between the muscle insertions, the cuboidal clear cells, as well as the stroma blood vessels, were scarce. At the light microscope level, the basement membrane was distinct in the cornea but not in the limbus or the conjunctiva. Autoradiographs demonstrated that, at the limbus, the basal cells migrated very quickly to the suprabasal region and remained there up to the 28-day interval. Labeled cells were identified in all epithelial layers of the cornea, including the basal one, at 21 and 28 days but not in the limbal basal clear cells. The rate of renewal of conjunctival epithelium was similar to that observed for the transition with scarce clear cells. The high-resolution autoradiographs demonstrated that the basal cuboidal clear limbal cells exhibit a quick renewal and that they are not label-retaining cells.

Although a variety of molecules, for example, VEGF, ETS-1 or nestin have been implicated in tumour angiogenesis, the molecular mechanisms of vessel formation are not fully characterized. We showed that the Wilms' tumour suppressor WT1 activates nestin during development. Here we tested whether WT1 might also be involved in tumour angiogenesis. Endothelial WT1 expression was detected in 95% of 113 tumours of different origin. To analyse the function of WT1 in endothelial cells, we used an RNAi approach in vitro and showed that inhibition of WT1 reduces cell proliferation, migration and endothelial tube formation. On a molecular level, WT1 silencing diminished expression of the ETS-1 transcription factor. WT1 and ETS-1 shared an overlapping expression in tumour endothelia. The ETS-1 promoter was stimulated approximately 10-fold by transient co-transfection of a WT1 expression construct and WT1 bound to the ETS-1 promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Deletion of the identified WT1-binding site abolished stimulation of the ETS-1 promoter by WT1.

Since HIF regulates critical angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and lesions in VHL gene are present in a majority of the highly vascularized renal cell carcinoma (RCC), it is believed that deregulation of the VHL-HIF pathway is crucial for the proangiogenic activity of RCC. Although VEGF has been confirmed as a critical angiogenic factor upregulated in VHL-mutant cells, the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy specifically targeting VEGF signaling remains modest. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional in vitro assay to evaluate the ability of RCC cells to promote cord formation by the primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs). Compared with VHL wild-type cells, VHL-mutant RCC cells demonstrated a significantly increased proangiogenic activity, which correlated with increased secretion of cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61)/cysteine-rich 61-connective tissue growth factor-nephroblastoma overexpressed (CCN) 1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)/CCN2 and VEGF in conditioned culture medium. Both CCN proteins are required for HDMEC cord formation as shown by RNA interference knockdown experiments. Importantly, the proangiogenic activities conferred by the CCN proteins and VEGF are additive, suggesting non-overlapping functions. Expression of the CCN proteins is at least partly dependent on the HIF-2alpha function, the dominant HIF-alpha isoform expressed in RCC. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of Cyr61/CCN1 and CTGF/CCN2 in RCC tissue samples showed that increased expression of these proteins correlates with the loss of VHL protein expression. These findings strengthened the notion that the hypervascularized phenotype of RCC is afforded by multiple proangiogenic factors that function in parallel pathways.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2008-01-24", "authors": ["Mastan RChintalapudi", "MargaretMarkiewicz", "NurgunKose", "VincentDammai", "Kristen JChampion", "Rana SHoda", "MariaTrojanowska", "TienHsu"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgn019"}

We investigated the role of recipient versus donor PD-1 ligands in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection with emphasis on the role of tissue expression in regulating this alloimmune response in vivo.\nWe used established major histocompatibility complex class II- and class I-mismatched models of vascularized cardiac allograft rejection, blocking anti-PDL1 and anti-PDL2 antibodies, and PDL1- and PDL2-deficient mice (as donors or recipients) to study the role of the PD-1:PDL1/PDL2 pathway in chronic rejection. We also used PDL1-deficient and wild-type mice and bone marrow transplantation to generate chimeric animals that express PDL1 exclusively on either hematopoietic or parenchymal cells. PDL1 but not PDL2 blockade significantly accelerated cardiac allograft rejection in the bm12-into-B6 and B6-into-bm12 models. Although wild-type cardiac allografts survived long term, PDL1-/- donor hearts transplanted into wild-type bm12 mice exhibited accelerated rejection and vasculopathy associated with enhanced recipient T-cell alloreactivity. Interestingly, PDL1-/- recipients did not exhibit an accelerated tempo of cardiac allograft rejection. Using chimeric animals as donors, we show that PDL1 expression on cardiac tissue alone significantly prolonged graft survival compared with full PDL1-/- donor grafts in transplanted wild-type recipients.\nThis is the first report to demonstrate that expression of the negative costimulatory molecule PDL1 on donor cardiac tissue regulates recipient alloimmune responses, allograft rejection, and vasculopathy.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2008-01-24", "authors": ["JunYang", "JoycePopoola", "ShakilaKhandwala", "NidyanandhVadivel", "VijayVanguri", "XueliYuan", "ShirineDada", "IndiraGuleria", "ChaoruiTian", "M JaveedAnsari", "TahiroShin", "HideoYagita", "MiyukiAzuma", "Mohamed HSayegh", "AnilChandraker"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.741025"}

We assessed the expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3, together with blood and lymphatic vessel extents and proliferation index (PI) values, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 6 normal human pituitary glands and 53 pituitary adenomas of different tumour grade, on consecutive tissue sections. VEGF-C was detected in around 10% of the endocrine cells in normal pituitary tissue, while this gland was devoid of lymphatic vascularization and showed very few vessels positive for VEGFR-3. Concerning tumour tissue, most of the adenomas showing VEGF-C immunoreactivity (21/47) were positive in 60% of the tumour cells and the ones positive for VEGFR-3 showed a number of immunostained vessels higher than those observed in the normal pituitary. Most of the tumours positive for VEGFR-3 did not show any LYVE-1 positive vessels (18/53), suggesting that at least in these cases, VEGFR-3 is expressed on blood vessels. Nevertheless, we observed a significant association between low expression of VEGFR-3 and low lymphatic vessel number, suggesting that VEGFR-3 might be involved in the starting of DE NOVO lymphangiogenesis in this tumour type. Moreover, tumours bearing lymphatic vessels showed the tendency to shift towards a more aggressive behaviour (high tumour grade and high PI). In conclusion, the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 system might be involved in controlling tumour angiogenesis in the pituitary adenomas lacking lymphatic vessels, but may also play a role in starting the process of tumour lymphangiogenesis.", "journal": "Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association", "date": "2008-01-22", "authors": ["COnofri", "MLosa", "EUhl", "G KStalla", "URenner"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2007-992120"}

One-hour pad tests and urodynamic studies were performed in clinically incontinent women pre- and postoperatively.\nEvaluation of the Doppler velocimetric parameters of bladder neck and periurethral vessels before and after LH, including number of vessels, pulsatility index, systolic peak, and minimum diastole, revealed no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). In addition, the prevalence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) decreased significantly from 37.1% (n = 26) preoperatively to 17.1% (n = 12) postoperatively (p < 0.01). A total of 19 patients reported no further SUI following LH. Their urinary leakages on the pad tests had all <10 g before surgery.

The neural retina was found to be a site of GH gene expression, as GH mRNA was abundant in cells of the retinal ganglion cell layer, in which GH was also detected. It was also a site of GH action, since GH receptor (GHR) immunoreactivity mirrored that of GH. Actions of GH within the eye were indicated by a reduction in its axial length and retinal width (its neuroblastic, inner plexiform, and optic fiber layers) in GHR gene disrupted mice (GHR-/-), in comparison with wild type (GHR+/+) littermates. In the absence of GH signaling, four proteins in the retinal proteome of the GHR-/- mice (identified by 2-D gels and MS) differed in abundance with those in the wild type mice. Brain abundant membrane attached signal protein-1 (BASP-1) was down-regulated, whereas protein kinase C inhibitor 1, cyclophilin A, KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated protein 3 were up-regulated in GHR-/- mice.

However, methods currently used for local administration of knockdown reagents, such as short interfering RNA (siRNA), are not satisfactory as to simplicity and efficiency. We established an electroporation method involving a constant voltage and \"plate and fork\" type electrodes and used it for in vivo delivery of siRNA. The delivery efficiency correlated to the electric current. The electric current correlated to the microvascular density and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and exhibited a threshold that guaranteed efficient delivery. Consequently, we showed that the vascularization and VEGF expression in tumors determined the efficiency of delivery of siRNA by electroporation. VEGF was chosen as a model target. VEGF siRNA electroporation suppressed the growth of tumors exhibiting high VEGF expression to less than 10% of the control level, but it had no effect on low VEGF-expressing tumors. Notably, a long interval (20 days) of electroporation was enough to obtain a satisfactory effect. Systemically injected siRNA could also be delivered into tumors by this method.

The implanted engineered cartilage underwent a remodeling process, forming a solid tracheal framework. Constructs harvested after 10 weeks proved to have significantly better mechanical properties than after 6 weeks and were comparable with the rabbit's native trachea.\nScaffold-free engineered cartilage can successfully fabricate a well-vascularized, autologous neotrachea with excellent mechanical properties.

Inhibition of Erg expression by antisense in HUVECs also lowered expression of the adhesion molecule vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, a key regulator of endothelial intercellular junctions and survival. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that Erg binds to the VE-cadherin promoter. Furthermore, Erg was found to enhance VE-cadherin promoter activity in a transactivation assay.

Mature females were induced to spawn by using carp pituitary extract for study of ovarian regression up to 5 days post-spawning. Morphometric analyses showed that the postovulatory follicle area decreased progressively after spawning and was coupled to the gonadosomatic index (r=0.92). During ovarian regression, follicular cells detached from the neighboring cells and basement membrane and then died by apoptosis. The follicular basement membrane became thicker and diffuse and was breached during regression of the postovulatory follicles. Follicular apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, histology, and electron microscopy. The ladder pattern of apoptotic DNA was revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The apoptotic index for the follicular cells increased until 3 days post-spawning and decreased thereafter. Immunohistochemistry reactions detected caspase 3, integrin beta1, and collagen type IV in the follicular layer of the postovulatory follicles. Labeling for integrin beta1 and collagen type IV decreased significantly, whereas a peak in cell death occurred 3 days post-spawning. At 4-5 days post-spawning, the connective theca was more thickened and vascularized. Simultaneously, granulocytes migrated toward the follicular lumen.

Although all of these mechanisms of vascularization have sufficient contrasting features to warrant consideration under separate cover, one common feature shared by all is their sensitivity to the VEGF signaling pathway. Conditions such as wound healing and physical exercise result in increased production of reactive oxygen species such as H(2)O(2), and both are associated with increased tissue vascularization. Understanding these two scenarios of adult tissue vascularization in tandem offers the potential to unlock the significance of redox regulation of the VEGF signaling pathway. Does H(2)O(2) support tissue vascularization? H(2)O(2) induces the expression of the most angiogenic form of VEGF, VEGF-A, by a HIF-independent and Sp1-dependent mechanism. Ligation of VEGF-A to VEGFR2 results in signal transduction leading to tissue vascularization. Such ligation generates H(2)O(2) via an NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism. Disruption of VEGF-VEGFR2 ligation-dependent H(2)O(2) production or decomposition of such H(2)O(2) stalls VEGFR2 signaling. Numerous antioxidants exhibit antiangiogenic properties.

An electrical dermatome was used for graft harvesting. All patients had contraindications for buccal mucosal grafting (e.g. radiotherapy, leukoplakia). The assessment before repair comprised a clinical investigation, urine analysis, uroflowmetry, retrograde and voiding cystogram, urethral ultrasonography and endoscopy. The follow-up was based on an assessment of flow rate and postvoid residual volume. Success was defined by the absence of symptoms and stable maximum flow rate, while any further instrumentation was considered a failure.\nThe mean (range) stricture length was 8.35 (3-14) cm. The overall complication rate was 7%, with no complications during surgery. During the mean (range) follow-up of 32.43 (5-46) months, 25 (93%) of the patients were successfully cured in one operation. Two patients required further treatment for recurrence and fistula. No long-term complications were noted at the graft donor sites. There was no case of intraurethral hair growth during the extended follow-up.\nIf there are contraindications for buccal mucosal grafting, a split-thickness skin can be used for dorsal inlay urethroplasty in recurrent AUS. A well-vascularized recipient bed on the corpora cavernosa is required for reliable graft take. Intra-urethral hair growth is avoided by using split-skin grafts. Although the complication rates are equivalent to those of buccal mucosa, we await the longer follow-up to assess the ultimate value of this alternative single-stage technique.", "journal": "BJU international", "date": "2008-01-15", "authors": ["OriettaDalpiaz", "AndreaKerschbaumer", "AlexandrePelzer", "ChristianRadmayr", "ChristianGozzi", "WolfgangHorninger", "GeorgBartsch", "ChristianSchwentner"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07436.x"}

{"title": "Graded hypoxia modulates the invasive potential of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA MB231 carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Spatial and temporal oxygen heterogeneity exists in most solid tumour microenvironments due to an inadequate vascular network supplying a dense population of tumour cells. An imbalance between oxygen supply and demand leads to hypoxia within a significant proportion of a tumour, which has been correlated to the likelihood of metastatic dissemination in both rodent tumour models and human patients. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that near-anoxic in vitro exposure results in transiently increased metastatic potential in some tumour cell lines. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of graded low oxygen conditions on the invasive phenotype of human tumour cells using an in vitro model of basement membrane invasion, in which we measured oxygen availability directly at the invasion surface of the transwell chamber. Our results show a relationship between culture vessel geometry and time to achieve hypoxia which may affect the interpretation of low oxygen experiments. We exposed the human tumour cell lines, HT1080 and MDA MB231, to graded normobaric oxygen (5% O(2)-0.2% O(2)) either during or prior to in vitro basement membrane invasion to simulate conditions of intravasation and extravasation. A secondary aim was to investigate the potential regulation of matrix metalloproteinase activity by oxygen availability. We identified significant reductions in invasive ability under low oxygen conditions for the HT1080 cell line and an increase in invasion at intermediate oxygen conditions for the MDA MB231 cell line. There were differences in the absolute activity of the individual matrix metalloproteinases, MMP-2, -9, -14, between the two cell lines, however there were no significant changes following exposure to hypoxic conditions. This study demonstrates cell line specific effects of graded oxygen levels on invasive potential and suggests that intermediate levels of low oxygen may increase metastatic dissemination.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2008-01-12", "authors": ["PatrickSubarsky", "Richard PHill"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-007-9139-x"}
{"title": "Primary sequence of ionic self-assembling peptide gels affects endothelial cell adhesion and capillary morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Appropriate choice of biomaterial supports is critical for the study of capillary morphogenesis in vitro as well as to support vascularization of engineered tissues in vivo. Self-assembling peptides are a class of synthetic, ionic, oligopeptides that spontaneously assemble into gels with an ECM-like microarchitecture when exposed to salt. In this paper, the ability of four different self-assembling peptide gels to promote endothelial cell adhesion and capillary morphogenesis is explored. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured within ionic self-assembling peptide family members, RAD16-I ((RADA)(4)), RAD16-II ((RARADADA)(2)), KFE-8 ((FKFE)(2)), or KLD-12 ((KLDL)(3)). HUVECs suspended in RAD16-I or RAD16-II gels elongated and formed interconnected capillary-like networks resembling in vivo capillaries, while they remained round and formed clusters within KFE-8 or KLD-12 gels. As HUVECs attach to RAD16-I and RAD16-II significantly better than the other peptides, these differences appear to be explained by differences in cell adhesion. Although adhesion likely occurs via bound adhesion proteins, there appears to be no difference in protein binding to the peptides investigated. Results indicate that, although these oligopeptides have similar mechanisms of self- assembly, their primary sequence can greatly affect cell adhesion. Additionally, a subset of these biomimetic ECM-like materials support capillary morphogenesis and thus may be useful for supporting vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Among the factors potentially interfering with its effectiveness is a hypothetical neoangiogenic reaction due to ischemia. In our study, we evaluated the changes in the levels of two angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and basic fibroblast growth factor [b-FGF]) and one parameter of invasiveness (urokinase-type plasminogen activator [uPA]) in patients treated with TACE.\nThree blood samples were provided from 71 HCC patients undergoing TACE: before TACE (t0), after 3 days (t1), and after 4 wk, when they had spiral computed tomography (sCT) scanning (t2). The referring radiologists blindly evaluated tumor burden and vascularization at t0 and residual activity at t2. The choice of TACE as treatment was based on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines.\nComplete response at sCT was recorded in 27% of patients; mean survival was 35 months (confidence interval [CI] 31-40) and the 4-yr survival was 57%. VEGF levels were significantly correlated with the number of nodes and were higher in nonresponders at t2 (P = 0.01); below-median VEGF levels predicted a longer survival (P = 0.008). b-FGF correlated with VEGF, tumor size, vascularization, and residual activity, showing a borderline correlation with survival. uPA correlated with tumor size and VEGF. VEGF was singled out in the Cox multivariate analysis as an independent predictor of survival.\nWhen TACE is not totally effective, it may induce a significant neoangiogenetic reaction, as suggested by an increase in VEGF and b-FGF following treatment; this affects patient survival.

{"title": "Vascular morphogenesis by adult bone marrow progenitor cells in three-dimensional fibrin matrices.", "abstract": "The neovascularization of tissues is accomplished by two distinct processes: de novo formation of blood vessels through the assembly of progenitor cells during early prenatal development (vasculogenesis), and expansion of a pre-existing vascular network by endothelial cell sprouting (angiogenesis), the main mechanism of blood vessel growth in postnatal life. Evidence exists that adult bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells can contribute to the formation of new vessels by their incorporation into sites of active angiogenesis. Aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro self-organizing capacity of human BM mononuclear cells (BMMNC) to induce vascular morphogenesis in a three-dimensional (3D) matrix environment in the absence of pre-existing vessels. Whole BMMNC as well as the adherent and non-adherent fractions of BMMNC were embedded in fibrin gels and cultured for 3-4 weeks without additional growth factors. The expression of hematopoietic-, endothelial-, smooth muscle lineage, and stem cell markers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The culture of unselected BMMNC in 3D fibrin matrices led to the formation of cell clusters expressing the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) markers CD133, CD34, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, and c-kit, with stellar shaped spreading of peripheral elongated cells forming tube-like structures with increasing complexity over time. Cluster formation was dependent on the presence of both adherent and non-adherent BMMNC without the requirement of external growth factors. Developed vascular structures expressed the endothelial markers CD34, VEGFR-2, CD31, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), and podocalyxin, showed basement-membrane-lined lumina containing CD45+ cells and were surrounded by alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expressing mural cells.

Using an antagonistic TIM-1-specific antibody, we studied the role of TIM-1 in alloimmunity. A short course of TIM-1-specific antibody monotherapy prolonged survival of fully MHC-mismatched vascularized mouse cardiac allografts. This prolongation was associated with inhibition of alloreactive Th1 responses and preservation of Th2 responses. TIM-1-specific antibody treatment was more effective in Th1-type cytokine-deficient Stat4(-/-) recipients as compared with Th2-type cytokine-deficient Stat6(-/-) recipients. Subtherapeutic doses of rapamycin plus TIM-1-specific antibody resulted in allograft acceptance and prevented the development of chronic allograft vasculopathy. Allograft survival via this treatment was accompanied by a Th1- to Th2-type cytokine switch. Depletion of natural Tregs abrogated the graft-protecting effect of the TIM-1-specific antibody. Importantly, CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs obtained from long-term survivors had enhanced regulatory activity as compared with naive CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs.

{"title": "Limbal stem cell transplantation: an evidence-based analysis.", "abstract": "The objective of this analysis is to systematically review limbal stem cell transplantation (LSCT) for the treatment of patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). This evidence-based analysis reviews LSCT as a primary treatment for nonpterygium LSCD conditions, and LSCT as an adjuvant therapy to excision for the treatment of pterygium.\nCONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION The outer surface of the eye is covered by 2 distinct cell layers: the corneal epithelial layer that overlies the cornea, and the conjunctival epithelial layer that overlies the sclera. These cell types are separated by a transitional zone known as the limbus. The corneal epithelial cells are renewed every 3 to 10 days by a population of stem cells located in the limbus. NONPTERYGIUM LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY: When the limbal stem cells are depleted or destroyed, LSCD develops. In LSCD, the conjunctival epithelium migrates onto the cornea (a process called conjunctivalization), resulting in a thickened, irregular, unstable corneal surface that is prone to defects, ulceration, corneal scarring, vascularization, and opacity. Patients experience symptoms including severe irritation, discomfort, photophobia, tearing, blepharospasm, chronic inflammation and redness, and severely decreased vision. Depending on the degree of limbal stem cell loss, LSCD may be total (diffuse) or partial (local). In total LSCD, the limbal stem cell population is completed destroyed and conjunctival epithelium covers the entire cornea. In partial LSCD, some areas of the limbus are unharmed, and the corresponding areas on the cornea maintain phenotypically normal corneal epithelium. Confirmation of the presence of conjunctivalization is necessary for LSCD diagnosis as the other characteristics and symptoms are nonspecific and indicate a variety of diseases. The definitive test for LSCD is impression cytology, which detects the presence of conjunctival epithelium and its goblet cells on the cornea. However, in the opinion of a corneal expert, diagnosis is often based on clinical assessment, and in the expert's opinion, it is unclear whether impression cytology is more accurate and reliable than clinical assessment, especially for patients with severe LSCD. The incidence of LSCD is not well understood. A variety of underlying disorders are associated with LSCD including chemical or thermal injuries, ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, multiple surgeries or cryotherapies, contact lens wear, extensive microbial infection, advanced ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and aniridia. In addition, some LSCD cases are idiopathic. These conditions are uncommon (e.g., the prevalence of aniridia ranges from 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000 people). PTERYGIUM: Pterygium is a wing-shaped fibrovascular tissue growth from the conjunctiva onto the cornea. Pterygium is the result of partial LSCD caused by localized ultraviolet damage to limbal stem cells. As the pterygium invades the cornea, it may cause irregular astigmatism, loss of visual acuity, chronic irritation, recurrent inflammation, double vision, and impaired ocular motility. Pterygium occurs worldwide. Incidence and prevalence rates are highest in the \"pterygium belt,\" which ranges from 30 degrees north to 30 degrees south of the equator, and lower prevalence rates are found at latitudes greater than 40 degrees. The prevalence of pterygium for Caucasians residing in urban, temperate climates is estimated at 1.2%. EXISTING TREATMENTS OTHER THAN TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: NONPTERYGIUM LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY: In total LSCD, a patient's limbal stem cells are completely depleted, so any successful treatment must include new stem cells. Autologous oral mucosal epithelium transplantation has been proposed as an alternative to LSCT. However, this procedure is investigational, and there is very limited level 4c evidence() to support this technique (fewer than 20 eyes examined in 4 case series and 1 case report). For patients with partial LSCD, treatment may not be necessary if their visual axis is not affected. However, if the visual axis is conjunctivalized, several disease management options exist including repeated mechanical debridement of the abnormal epithelium; intensive, nonpreserved lubrication; bandage contact lenses; autologous serum eye drops; other investigational medical treatments; and transplantation of an amniotic membrane inlay. However, these are all disease management treatments; LSCT is the only curative option. PTERYGIUM: The primary treatment for pterygium is surgical excision. However, recurrence is a common problem after excision using the bare sclera technique: reported recurrence rates range from 24% to 89%. Thus, a variety of adjuvant therapies have been used to reduce the risk of pterygium recurrence including LSCT, amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT), conjunctival autologous (CAU) transplantation, and mitomycin C (MMC, an antimetabolite drug). NEW TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: To successfully treat LSCD, the limbal stem cell population must be repopulated. To achieve this, 4 LSCT procedures have been developed: conjunctival-limbal autologous (CLAU) transplantation; living-related conjunctival-limbal allogeneic (lr-CLAL) transplantation; keratolimbal allogeneic (KLAL) transplantation; and ex vivo expansion of limbal stem cells transplantation. Since the ex vivo expansion of limbal stem cells transplantation procedure is considered experimental, it has been excluded from the systematic review. These procedures vary by the source of donor cells and the amount of limbal tissue used. For CLAU transplants, limbal stem cells are obtained from the patient's healthy eye. For lr-CLAL and KLAL transplants, stem cells are obtained from living-related and cadaveric donor eyes, respectively. In CLAU and lr-CLAL transplants, 2 to 4 limbal grafts are removed from the superior and inferior limbus of the donor eye. In KLAL transplants, the entire limbus from the donor eye is used. The recipient eye is prepared by removing the abnormal conjunctival and scar tissue. An incision is made into the conjunctival tissue into which the graft is placed, and the graft is then secured to the neighbouring limbal and scleral tissue with sutures. Some LSCT protocols include concurrent transplantation of an amniotic membrane onto the cornea.\nHealth Canada does not require premarket licensure for stem cells. However, they are subject to Health Canada's clinical trial regulations until the procedure is considered accepted transplantation practice, at which time it will be covered by the Safety of Human Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation Regulations (CTO Regulations).\nThe Medical Advisory Secretariat systematically reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness and safety of LSCT for the treatment of patients with nonpterygium LSCD and pterygium. A comprehensive search method was used to retrieve English-language journal articles from selected databases. The GRADE approach was used to systematically and explicitly evaluate the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.\nNONPTERYGIUM LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY: The search identified 873 citations published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2008. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, and 1 additional citation was identified through a bibliography review. The review included 10 case series (3 prospective and 7 retrospective). Patients who received autologous transplants (i.e., CLAU) achieved significantly better long-term corneal surface results compared with patients who received allogeneic transplants (lr-CLAL, P< .001; KLAL, P< .001). There was no significant difference in corneal surface outcomes between the allogeneic transplant options, lr-CLAL and KLAL (P = .328). However, human leukocyte antigen matching and systemic immunosuppression may improve the outcome of lr-CLAL compared with KLAL. Regardless of graft type, patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome had poorer long-term corneal surface outcomes. Concurrent AMT was associated with poorer long-term corneal surface improvements. When the effect of the AMT was removed, the difference between autologous and allogeneic transplants was much smaller. Patients who received CLAU transplants had a significantly higher rate of visual acuity improvements compared with those who received lr-CLAL transplants (P = .002). However, to achieve adequate improvements in vision, patients with deep corneal scarring will require a corneal transplant several months after the LSCT. No donor eye complications were observed. Epithelial rejection and microbial keratitis were the most common long-term complications associated with LSCT (complications occurred in 6%-15% of transplantations). These complications can result in graft failure, so patients should be monitored regularly following LSCT. PTERYGIUM: The search yielded 152 citations published between January 1, 2000 and May 16, 2008. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated LSCT as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of pterygium met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Limbal stem cell transplantation was compared with CAU, AMT, and MMC. The results showed that CLAU significantly reduced the risk of pterygium recurrence compared with CAU (relative risk [RR], 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.69; P = .02). CLAU reduced the risk of pterygium recurrence for primary pterygium compared with MMC, but this comparison did not reach statistical significance (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.21-1.10; P = .08). Both AMT and CLAU had similar low rates of recurrence (2 recurrences in 43 patients and 4 in 46, respectively), and the RR was not significant (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.37-9.5; P = .45).

We found that sorafenib effectively inhibited cell proliferation in rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma with IC(50) values <5 \u03bcM. Sorafenib effectively induced growth arrest in rhabdomyosarcoma cells, which was concurrent with inhibition of Akt and Erk signaling. Studies of ligand-induced phosphorylation of Erk and Akt in rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed that insulin-like growth factor-1 is a potent activator, which can be blocked by treatment with sorafenib. In vivo sorafenib treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts had a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth, which was associated with inhibited vascularization and enhanced necrosis in the adjacent tumor stroma. Our results demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo growth of rhabdomyosarcoma can be suppressed by treatment with sorafenib, and suggests the possibilities of using sorafenib as a potential adjuvant therapy for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma.", "journal": "OncoTargets and therapy", "date": "2008-01-01", "authors": ["WessenMaruwge", "P\u00e1draigD'Arcy", "AnnikaFolin", "SlavicaBrnjic", "JohanWejde", "AnthonyDavis", "FredrikErlandsson", "JonasBergh", "BerthaBrodin"], "doi": "10.2147/ott.s3833"}

Tumor angiogenesis depends mainly on the release by neoplasic cells of growth factors specific for endothelial cells (ECs), able to stimulate growth of the host blood vessels. The aim of this study was to analyze the apoptotic effect of some cytostatics, Vinblastine, Rapamycin and Doxorubicin, and vegetal extracts (called VOB) isolated and purified from Vitis sp., on human EA.hy926 endothelial cell line. In a proliferation assay using Crystal Violet, we demonstrated that Vinblastine and Rapamycin cytostatics have synergistic effect on endothelial cell line EA.hy926 growth inhibition. The inhibitory effects of Vinblastine and Doxorubicin were enhanced by VOB vegetal extracts. A combined treatment of cytostatics and VOB vegetal extracts resulted in a stronger antiproliferative effect of EA.hy926 endothelial cells.

{"title": "Targets of tyrosine nitration in diabetic rat retina.", "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy, a retinal vascular disease, is inhibited in animals treated with aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of inducible nitric-oxide synthase. This treatment also reduces retinal protein nitration, which is greater in diabetic rat retina than nondiabetic retina. As an approach to understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic retinopathy, we sought the identity of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in retina from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in a rat retinal M\u00fcller cell line grown in high glucose (25 mM). Anti-nitrotyrosine immunoprecipitation products from rat retina and M\u00fcller cells were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Ten nitrated proteins in diabetic rat retina and three nitrated proteins in M\u00fcller cells grown in high glucose were identified; three additional nitrotyrosine-containing proteins were tentatively identified from diabetic retina. The identified nitrotyrosine-containing proteins participate in a variety of processes including glucose metabolism, signal transduction, and transcription/translation. Among the nitrated proteins were insulin-responsive glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4), which has been implicated previously in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus; exocyst complex component Exo70, which functions in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake of GLUT-4-containing vesicles; and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, which influences retinal vascularization via fibroblast growth factor signaling. Nitration of tyrosine phosphorylation sites were identified in five proteins, including GLUT-4, exocyst complex component Exo70, protein-tyrosine phosphatase eta, sensory neuron synuclein, and inositol trisphosphate receptor 3. Quantitation of nitration and phosphorylation at common tyrosine modification sites in GLUT-4 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase eta from diabetic and nondiabetic animals suggests that nitration reduced tyrosine phosphorylation approximately 2X in these proteins from diabetic retina.

We compared the properties of alloantigen (Ag)-pulsed, rapamycin (Rapa)-conditioned and control bone marrow-derived host myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) and their potential, together with transient immunosuppression (anti-lymphocyte serum+cyclosporine), to promote long-term, vascularized skin graft survival in Lewis rats across a full MHC barrier. Both types of DCs expressed low levels of CD86, but Rapa DC expressed lower levels of MHC II and CD40 and were less stimulatory in MLR. While both Rapa and control DCs produced low levels of IL-12p70 and moderate levels of IL-6 and IL-10 following TLR ligation, Rapa DC secreted significantly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in response to LPS. Donor Ag-pulsed Rapa DC, but not control DC, induced long-term skin graft survival (median survival time >133 days) when administered 7 and 14 days post-transplant. Circulating T cells in hosts with long-surviving grafts were hyporesponsive to donor alloAg stimulation, but proliferated in response to third-party stimulation and produced IFN-gamma and IL-10. When recipients of long-surviving grafts were challenged with skin grafts, donor but not third-party grafts were prolonged, suggesting underlying regulatory mechanisms. Both flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that donor Ag-pulsed Rapa DC infusion expanded CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg in recipients' spleens, graft-associated lymph nodes and the graft.

{"title": "Bone vascular supply in monitor lizards (Squamata: Varanidae): influence of size, growth, and phylogeny.", "abstract": "Bone vascular canals occur irregularly in tetrapods; however, the reason why a species has or lacks bone canals remains poorly understood. Basically, this feature could depend on phylogenetic history, or result from diverse causes, especially cortical accretion rate. The Varanidae, a monophyletic clade that includes species with impressive size differences but similar morphologies, is an excellent model for this question. Cortical vascularization was studied in 20 monitor species, on three bones (femur, fibula, and tibia) that differ in their shaft diameters, and in the absolute growth speed of their diaphyseal cortices. In all species smaller than 398 mm SVL (133-397 mm in sample), bone cortices lack vascular canals, whereas all larger species (460-1,170 mm in sample) display canals. The size 398-460 mm SVL is thus a threshold for the appearance of the canals. The distribution of vascular and avascular bone tissues among species does not precisely reflect phylogenetic relationships. When present, vascular canals always occur in the femur and tibia, but are less frequent, sparser, and thinner in the fibula. Vascular density increases linearly with specific size but decreases exponentially during individual growth. In most species, canal orientation varies between individuals and is diverse in a single section. No clear relationship exists between canal orientation and vascular density. These results suggest that: a) the occurrence and density of bone vascular canals are basically dependant on specific size, not phylogenetic relationships; b) vascular density reflects the absolute growth rates of bone cortices; c) the orientation of vascular canals is a variable feature independent of phylogeny or growth rate.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2007-12-25", "authors": ["Viviande Buffr\u00e9nil", "AlexandraHoussaye", "WolfgangB\u00f6hme"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10604"}

During liver ontogenesis, the development of the hepatic artery appears to be modulated by unknown signals originating from the bile duct. Given the capability of cholangiocytes to produce angiogenic growth factors and influence peribiliary vascularization, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and their cognate receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, Tie-2) in fetal human livers at different gestational ages and in mice characterized by defective biliary morphogenesis (Hnf6(-/-)). The results showed that throughout the different developmental stages, VEGF was expressed by developing bile ducts and angiopoietin-1 by hepatoblasts, whereas their cognate receptors were variably expressed by vascular cells according to the different maturational stages. Precursors of endothelial and mural cells expressed VEGFR-2 and Tie-2, respectively. In immature hepatic arteries, endothelial cells expressed VEGFR-1, whereas mural cells expressed both Tie-2 and Angiopoietin-2. In mature hepatic arteries, endothelial cells expressed Tie-2 along with VEGFR-1. In early postnatal Hnf6(-/-) mice, VEGF-expressing ductal plates failed to incorporate into the portal mesenchyma, resulting in severely altered arterial vasculogenesis.\nThe reciprocal expression of angiogenic growth factors and receptors during development supports their involvement in the cross talk between liver epithelial cells and the portal vasculature.

Remarkably, wild type FTSG survived on TSP1 null or CD47 null mice, indicating that TSP1 expression in the wound bed is the primary determinant of graft survival. FTSG survival in wild type mice could be moderately improved by increasing NO flux, but graft survival was increased significantly through antibody blocking of TSP1 binding to CD47 or antisense morpholino oligonucleotide suppression of CD47.\nTSP1 through CD47 limits skin graft survival.

To this end, we recently created a variant of VEGF(121), TG-VEGF(121) that directly binds to fibrin and gets released locally in proteolysis-triggered manner. Here we combined noninvasive biophotonic monitoring of VEGF receptor 2 gene activation in transgenic VEGFR2-luc mice and histomorphometry to compare endothelial activation and long-term neovascularization by actively released TG-VEGF(121)versus passively released, diffusible wild-type VEGF(121) in subcutaneous fibrin implants. Monitoring in real-time over 3 weeks of luciferase signal driven by the VEGFR2 promoter revealed endothelial activation in skin exposed to wild-type VEGF(121), but no detectable elevation over fibrin alone by TG-VEGF(121). Histology at 3 weeks, however, demonstrated that TG-VEGF(121) promoted vessel growth significantly more effectively and reliably than wild-type VEGF(121). The majority of vessels surviving to 3 weeks contained stabilizing smooth muscle cells. Yet, by 6 weeks, no extra vessels induced by exogenous VEGF were left.

{"title": "Angiogenesis in bone fracture healing: a bioregulatory model.", "abstract": "The process of fracture healing involves the action and interaction of many cells, regulated by biochemical and mechanical signals. Vital to a successful healing process is the restoration of a good vascular network. In this paper, a continuous mathematical model is presented that describes the different fracture healing stages and their response to biochemical stimuli only (a bioregulatory model); mechanoregulatory effects are excluded here. The model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the spatiotemporal evolution of concentrations and densities of the cell types, extracellular matrix types and growth factors indispensable to the healing process. The model starts after the inflammation phase, when the fracture callus has already been formed. Cell migration is described using not only haptokinetic, but also chemotactic and haptotactic influences. Cell differentiation is controlled by the presence of growth factors and sufficient vascularisation. Matrix synthesis and growth factor production are controlled by the local cell and matrix densities and by the local growth factor concentrations. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data obtained from literature, are presented. The simulation results are corroborated by comparison with experimental data from a standardised rodent fracture model. The results of sensitivity analyses on the parameter values as well as on the boundary and initial conditions are discussed. Numerical simulations of compromised healing situations showed that the establishment of a vascular network in response to angiogenic growth factors is a key factor in the healing process. Furthermore, a correct description of cell migration is also shown to be essential to the prediction of realistic spatiotemporal tissue distribution patterns in the fracture callus. The mathematical framework presented in this paper can be an important tool in furthering the understanding of the mechanisms causing compromised healing and can be applied in the design of future fracture healing experiments.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2007-12-25", "authors": ["LiesbetGeris", "AlfGerisch", "Jos VanderSloten", "R\u00fcdigerWeiner", "Hans VanOosterwyck"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.11.008"}

Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases.

Optimal anastomotic closure involves creating a watertight, tension-free anastomosis with well-vascularized, mucosal apposition and correct realignment of the urethra. The cause of BNC is poorly understood; however, it is likely related to multiple factors, including excessive luminal narrowing at the site of reconstruction, local tissue ischemia, failed mucosal apposition, and urinary leakage. In this large series of patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLRP), we report the incidence of BNC, evaluate the influence of age, body mass index (BMI), estimated blood loss (EBL), surgical time, and prostate weight on its development and assess follow-up urinary function.\nBetween February 2003 and July 2006, 650 consecutive men underwent RLRP at our institution. Patients with aborted or open conversion procedures were excluded from analysis. The mean overall follow-up for the remaining 634 patients was 19.5 months. Patients presenting with symptoms of outlet obstruction were evaluated with cystoscopy to confirm a BNC. Comparisons of age, BMI, EBL, operative time, and prostate weight were performed using the Student t-test and chi-square analysis.\nBNC was the diagnosis in seven patients (1.1%), with a mean time of presentation of 4.8 (3-12) months postoperatively. The BNC patients had comparable mean age, BMI, prostate weight, and EBL to the non-BNC cohort. Their operative time, however, was significantly longer (283 v 225 min, P = 0.04).\nThe incidence of BNC after radical prostatectomy is 1.1% in a large series of men undergoing RLRP. The diagnosis was made within 1 year. No significant impact on urinary continence or quality-of-life urinary function was observed after BNC management.

Images with 200-microm slice thicknesses were recorded and merged into a three-dimensional dataset, of which the relative color pixel density was determined. Animals received either VEGFR2 antibodies or 0.9% NaCl and were examined at days 0, 3 and 6 of treatment.

The dialysis process involves osmosis, as well as diffusive and convective transports through the highly vascularized peritoneal membrane. Computer simulations predicted that the membrane contains ultrasmall pores responsible for the selective transport of water across the capillary endothelium during crystalloid osmosis. The distribution of the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1), as well as its molecular structure ensuring an exquisite selectivity for water, fit with the characteristics of the ultrasmall pore. Peritoneal transport studies using AQP1 knockout mice demonstrated that the osmotic water flux across the peritoneal membrane is mediated by AQP1. This water transport accounts for 50% of the ultrafiltration during PD. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids upregulates the expression of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries, resulting in increased water transport and ultrafiltration in rats. AQP1 may also play a role during inflammation, as vascular proliferation and leukocyte recruitment are both decreased in mice lacking AQP1. These data illustrate the potential of the peritoneal membrane as an experimental model in the investigation of the role of AQP1 in the endothelium at baseline and during inflammation. They emphasize the critical role of AQP1 during PD and suggest that manipulating AQP1 expression could be clinically useful in PD patients.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2007-12-15", "authors": ["TomoyaNishino", "OlivierDevuyst"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-007-0402-4"}

We provide evidence here that the HEXIM1 C-terminal region is critical for cardiovascular development. HEXIM1 protein was detected in the heart during critical time periods in cardiac growth and chamber maturation. We created mice carrying an insertional mutation in the HEXIM1 gene that disrupted its C-terminal region and found that this resulted in prenatal lethality. Heart defects in HEXIM1(1 to 312) mice included abnormal coronary patterning and thin ventricular walls. The thin myocardium can be partly attributed to increased apoptosis. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecular precursor-1 staining of HEXIM1(1 to 312) heart sections revealed decreased vascularization of the myocardium despite the presence of coronary vasculature in the epicardium. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), known to affect angioblast invasion and myocardial proliferation and survival, was decreased in HEXIM1(1 to 312) mice compared with control littermates. We also observed decreased fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) expression, suggesting that effects of HEXIM1 in the myocardium are partly mediated through epicardial FGF9 signaling. Together our results suggest that HEXIM1 plays critical roles in coronary vessel development and myocardial growth. The basis for this role of HEXIM1 is that VEGF is a direct transcriptional target of HEXIM1, and involves attenuation a repressive effects of C/EBPalpha on VEGF gene transcription.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2007-12-15", "authors": ["Monica MMontano", "Yong QuiDoughman", "HuayunDeng", "LauraChaplin", "JianqiYang", "NancyWang", "QiangZhou", "Nicole LWard", "MichikoWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.157859"}

Angiogenesis and neovascularization as well as inflammatory leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction and microvascular leakage were analyzed over a 14-day time period using intravital fluorescence microscopy. Implantation of both hydroxyapatite and dentin scaffolds showed a slight increase in leukocyte recruitment compared with controls. This was associated with an elevation of microvascular permeability, which was comparable to that observed in response to isogeneic bone. In addition, hydroxyapatite as well as dentin scaffolds induced a marked angiogenic response, which resulted in complete vascularization of the implants until day 14. Of interest, in hydroxyapatite scaffolds, the newly formed capillaries were not as densely meshed as in dentin scaffolds, in which the functional capillary density was comparable to that measured in bone implants.

The molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin was identified as specifically induced with regard to expression level, modification by serine phosphorylation, and subcellular localization during tubular morphogenesis of endothelial cells. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of alphaB-crystallin expression did not affect endothelial proliferation but led to attenuated tubular morphogenesis, early activation of proapoptotic caspase-3, and increased apoptosis. alphaB-crystallin was expressed in a subset of human tumor vessels but not in normal capillaries. Tumors grown in alphaB-crystallin(-/-) mice were significantly less vascularized than wild-type tumors and displayed increased areas of apoptosis/necrosis. Importantly, tumor vessels in alphaB-crystallin(-/-) mice were leaky and showed signs of caspase-3 activation and extensive apoptosis. Ultrastructural analyses showed defective vessels partially devoid of endothelial lining.

Nevertheless, most biological assays of vascular spouting are conducted in a static mechanical milieu. Here we study embryonic mouse allantoides, which normally give raise to an umbilical artery and vein. However, when placed in culture, allantoides assemble a primary vascular network. Unlike other in vitro assays, allantoic primordial vascular cells are situated on the upper surface of a cellular layer that is engaged in robust spreading motion. Time-lapse imaging allows quantification of primordial vascular cell motility as well as the underlying mesothelial tissue motion. Specifically, we calculate endothelial cell-autonomous motion by subtracting the tissue-level mesothelial motion from the total endothelial cell displacements. Formation of new vascular polygons is hindered by administration of function-blocking VE-cadherin antibodies. Time-lapse recordings reveal that (1) cells at the base of sprouts normally move distally \"over\" existing sprout cells to form new tip-cells; and (2) loss of VE-cadherin activity prevents this motile behavior. Thus, endothelial cell-cell-adhesion-based motility is required for the advancement of vascular sprouts within a moving tissue environment.

The pEgr-Endostatin-EGFP plasmid was transfected into B16 cell line with liposome. The expression property of endostatin was investigated by RT-PCR and that of EGFP was detected by flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing mice were treated by the plasmid injection and 2 Gy X-irradiation of three fractions. Tumor growth was observed for 18 days after treatment. Change of tumor capillary formation was measured with histochemistry assay at the end of the experiment. The expression of GFP in B16 melanoma cells was detected after X-irradiation with 0.05-20 Gy. Time-course studies showed that the expression of GFP in B16 cells reached its peak at 8 h after irradiation with 2 Gy. The injection of pEgr-Endostatin-EGFP recombinant plasmid into the implanted B16 melanoma in C57BL/6J mice followed by local X-irradiation could significantly inhibit tumor growth with inhibition of intratumor micro-vessel density. The inhibitory effect of pEgr-Endostatin-EGFP gene-radiotherapy on the growth of B16 melanoma is correlated with the marked decrease of intratumoral vascularization.

{"title": "Pre-treatment of synthetic elastomeric scaffolds by cardiac fibroblasts improves engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Native myocardium consists of several cell types, of which approximately one-third are myocytes and most of the nonmyocytes are fibroblasts. By analogy with monolayer culture in which fibroblasts were removed to prevent overgrowth, early attempts to engineer myocardium utilized cell populations enriched for cardiac myocytes (CMs; approximately 80-90% of total cells). We hypothesized that the pre-treatment of synthetic elastomeric scaffolds with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) will enhance the functional assembly of the engineered cardiac constructs by creating an environment supportive of cardiomyocyte attachment and function. Cells isolated from neonatal rat ventricles were prepared to form three distinct populations: rapidly plating cells identified as CFs, slowly plating cells identified as CMs, and unseparated initial population of cells (US). The cell fractions (3 x 10(6) cells total) were seeded into poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds (highly porous discs, 5 mm in diameter x 2-mm thick) using Matrigeltrade mark, either separately (CM or CF), concurrently (US), or sequentially (CF pre-treatment followed by CM culture, CF + CM), and cultured in spinner flasks. The CF + CM group had the highest amplitude of contraction and the lowest excitation threshold, superior DNA content, and higher glucose consumption rate. The CF + CM group exhibited compact 100- to 200-mum thick layers of elongated myocytes aligned in parallel over layers of collagen-producing fibroblasts, while US and CM groups exhibited scattered and poorly elongated myocytes. The sequential co-culture of CF and CM on a synthetic elastomer scaffold thus created an environment supportive of cardiomyocyte attachment, differentiation, and contractile function, presumably due to scaffold conditioning by cultured fibroblasts. When implanted over the infarcted myocardium in a nude rat model, cell-free poly(glycerol sebacate) remained at the ventricular wall after 2 weeks of in vivo, and was vascularized.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Although non-unions are rare, their treatment has not been well defined yet. This report describes the arterial supply of the clavicle to clarify the pathological mechanism and the surgical procedure of non-unions. This study was based on delineation of the thoraco-acromial and suprascapular arteries with colored latex on 17 specimens (ten cadavers). Observations were made after macroscopic dissection and maceration. The main blood supply to the middle third of the clavicle was the periosteal. This supply came from the two branches of the thoraco-acromial trunk that penetrated the pectoralis major muscle and the deltoid muscle. In 13 cases, these two periosteal branches were anastomosed between these two muscle attachments. Periosteal vascularization was always seen on the superior surface and the anterior border of the bone, but never on the inferior surface or the posterior border. The suprascapular artery contributed to supply the middle third of the clavicle by several periosteal branches and also by an independent branch. This branch was born proximally near the internal, middle thirds union and passed along the posterior face of the subclavius muscle and pierced the bone through the nutria foramina located near the external, middle thirds union. Nevertheless, intraosseous arteries were noted only in four cases. In these cases, they were never more than 2cm long. Our results showed that the periosteal blood supply located between the muscles insertions and the arterial supply from the suprascapular artery could be twice compromised in case of important displacement or severe fracture. If treatments of clavicular fractures or non-unions cannot preserve the periosteal blood supply, bone grafting should be indicated.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2007-11-27", "authors": ["EricHavet", "FabriceDuparc", "Anne-ClaireTobenas-Dujardin", "Jean-MichelMuller", "Beno\u00eetDelas", "PierreFr\u00e9ger"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-007-0278-1"}

Mast cells have the capability of reacting both within minutes and over hours to specific stimuli, with local and systemic effects. Mast cells express the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) and upon aggregation of FcepsilonRI by allergen-specific IgE, mast cells release and generate biologically active preformed and newly synthesized mediators which are involved in many aspects of allergic inflammation.

However, future optimization of NET imaging may be achieved with positron emission tomography based methods utilizing more sensitive and specific tracers in combination with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Here we established an orthotopic mouse model that reflects relevant aspects of human pancreatic NETs such as SSTR expression, dense vascularization and metastatic disease. This model was then utilized to test the feasibility of combined magnetic resonance imaging and animal positron emission tomography. Orthotopic implantation of amphicrine, SSTR-positive pancreatic AR42J cells resulted in rapidly growing tumors, with concomitant metastatic spread into abdominal lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity. Primary tumors as well as their metastases expressed the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin. For imaging experiments, the SSTR ligands (68)Ga-DOTATOC or (68)Ga-DOTANOC were injected intravenously, and animals were subsequently examined in an animal positron emission tomography scanner and a clinical 3T (tesla) magnetic resonance imager. All animals showed radionuclide accumulation in the primary tumor. Definite anatomical correlation was achieved using digital image fusion of the positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data. (68)Ga-DOTANOC strongly accumulated in the tumor tissue (mean 6.6-fold vs. control tissues) when compared to (68)Ga-DOTATOC, which showed a higher renal clearance. In good agreement with the biodistribution data, the kidney-to-tumor ratio was higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC (2.43-fold vs. 1.75-fold). Consequently, (68)Ga-DOTANOC achieved better signal enhancement in the primary tumor and allowed for detection of metastatic lesions. In summary, we established a novel orthotopic pancreatic SSTR-positive tumor model and used this model to provide proof of principle for the diagnostic combination of SSTR-based molecular imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Specifically, the animal model allowed the comparative evaluation of (68)Ga-DOTANOC and (68)Ga-DOTATOC, with (68)Ga-DOTANOC providing better tumor-specific accumulation and renal activity.

{"title": "Biomimetic reliability strategies for self-healing vascular networks in engineering materials.", "abstract": "Self-healing via a vascular network is an active research topic, with several recent publications reporting the application and optimization of these systems. This work represents the first consideration of the probable failure modes of a self-healing system as a driver for network design. The critical failure modes of a proposed self-healing system based on a vascular network were identified via a failure modes, effects and criticality analysis and compared to those of the human circulatory system. A range of engineering and biomimetic design concepts to address these critical failure modes is suggested with minimum system mass the overall design driver for high-performance systems. Plant vasculature has been mimicked to propose a segregated network to address the risk of fluid leakage.

In response to decreased oxygen levels, the tumor cells initiate a program of adaptation by inducing the transcription of multiple genes via the activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Proteins encoded by a subset of genes induced by HIF promote tumorigenesis by acting directly on both the tumor cells and the microenvironment in which the tumor cells reside. The mechanism(s) by which hypoxia activates HIF is a subject of intensive research. Understanding how hypoxia activates HIF will provide targets for the development of therapies that could specifically target growing tumors by not allowing adequate adaptation to hypoxia, which is necessary for cancer progression.

To this end, we directly compared formation and functions of tissue-engineered blood vessels generated by peripheral blood- and umbilical cord blood-derived EPCs in a model of in vivo vasculogenesis. We found that adult peripheral blood EPCs form blood vessels that are unstable and regress within 3 weeks. In contrast, umbilical cord blood EPCs form normal-functioning blood vessels that last for more than 4 months. These vessels exhibit normal blood flow, perm-selectivity to macromolecules, and induction of leukocyte-endothelial interactions in response to cytokine activation similar to normal vessels.

{"title": "The effect of matrix density on the regulation of 3-D capillary morphogenesis.", "abstract": "The means by which extracellular matrix density regulates three-dimensional capillary morphogenesis is unclear. To study this phenomenon, we utilized a fibrin-based in vitro assay in which a fibroblast monolayer is plated atop a fibrin gel approximately 2.5 mm away from endothelial cell-coated beads within the matrix. Increasing fibrin density from 2.5 to 10 mg/ml resulted in a threefold reduction in capillary network formation. However, distributing fibroblasts throughout the matrix completely eliminated this inhibitory effect, resulting in robustly vascularized matrices suitable for in vivo applications, as functional anastomoses formed between the implanted tissues and host vasculature when implanted into immune-compromised mice. Dense matrices did not stimulate fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling: differentiation into myofibroblasts, matrix production, and protease secretion were not enhanced by the dense condition. Instead, quantifying diffusivity of FITC-dextran (molecular mass 10, 40, 70, and 150 kDa) through fibrin revealed a two- to threefold decrease within the 10 mg/ml matrices. Thus, distributing a proangiogenic source (fibroblasts) throughout the matrix stimulates capillary network formation by overcoming this diffusion restriction due to significantly reduced diffusion distances. Although roles for matrix stiffness and ligand binding density have previously been identified, our results emphasize the importance of diffusion restrictions in limiting capillary morphogenesis.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2007-11-13", "authors": ["Cyrus MGhajar", "XiaofangChen", "Joseph WHarris", "VinodSuresh", "Christopher C WHughes", "Noo LiJeon", "Andrew JPutnam", "Steven CGeorge"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.107.120774"}

Our aim was to assess the MDCTA signs and role in managing hemoptysis of pulmonary arterial origin.\nWe performed a retrospective clinical and radiologic analysis of all consecutive patients who were referred for severe hemoptysis to our RICU and were treated by endovascular means between January 2004 and December 2006. We reviewed all of those cases with hemoptysis of pulmonary arterial origin.\nOf 272 patients who were referred for severe hemoptysis to the RICU, 189 patients were treated by endovascular means. Thirteen patients (nine men, four women; mean age, 45 years) had hemoptysis of pulmonary arterial origin. Signs of pulmonary arterial hemoptysis seen on MDCTA were of the following three types: pseudoaneurysm (n = 5); aneurysm of the pulmonary artery (n = 3); or the presence of a pulmonary artery in the inner wall of a cavity (n = 5). Hypertrophy of the bronchial arteries seen on MDCTA associated with any of these signs predicted the necessity to treat both the bronchial and pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary artery vasoocclusion was performed as a first treatment in eight patients with such an association (n = 1) or without such an association (n = 7) along with bronchial artery embolization.

Our results show a restricted VEGF cellular expression to astroglial cells.

To elucidate the specific role of beta1 integrin in the vasculature, we conditionally deleted the beta1 gene in the endothelium. Homozygous deletion of beta1 integrins in the endothelium resulted in failure of normal vascular patterning, severe fetal growth retardation, and embryonic death at E9.5 to 10, although there were no overt effects on vasculogenesis. Heterozygous endothelial beta1 gene deletion did not diminish fetal or postnatal survival, but it reduced beta1 subunit expression in endothelial cells from adult mice by approximately 40%. These mice demonstrated abnormal vascular remodeling in response to experimentally altered in vivo blood flow and diminished vascularization in healing wounds. These data demonstrate that endothelial expression of beta1 integrin is required for developmental vascular patterning and that endothelial beta1 gene dosing has significant functional effects on vascular remodeling in the adult.

Such risks as excessive immune responses associated with this virus administration in vivo however have limited its applicability in clinical settings as is the case with other viral vectors including adenoviruses. In consequence of extensive assessment on the mechanisms of immune responses against SeV, we found that ex vivo infection of immature dendritic cells (DCs) with SeV demonstrates their spontaneous maturation and activation. We applied this result to create a unique, representative, and powerful agent to activate DCs, namely rSeV-modified DCs (rSeV/DCs), for use in cancer immunotherapy. Use of this system in vivo resulted in the induction of efficient antitumor immunity against vascularized rodent tumors, including melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and prostatic cancer, and it even frequently associated with elimination of those tumors. These results indicate that rSeV could be a powerful immune booster for DC-based cancer immunotherapy that is worth investigating further.

Forty male Fischer 344 rats underwent division of the proximal and distal tendons of the extensor digitorum longus muscle. Tendons were immediately repaired producing tendons with increased length, decreased length, or presurgical length (control).

The increased tendon length group did not differ significantly from the control tendon length group for any measurement. Histologically, muscles set with a decreased tendon length demonstrated normal appearing hypertrophied fibers, without evidence of detrimental histological effects such as fibrosis, denervation, necrosis, inflammation, fiber type changes, or fiber splitting.\nThese data support the clinical practice of setting muscles with increased passive tension when performing tendon transfer surgeries.

During the months following hatching, the cortical processes of oogenesis started in ovo continues and folliculogenesis is initiated. Additionally, the medullary region of the gonad undergoes dramatic restructuring. We describe alligator ovarian histology at hatching, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months of age in order to characterize the timing of morphological development and compare these findings to chicken ovary development. At hatching, the ovarian cortex presents a germinal epithelium containing oogonia and a few primary oocytes irregularly scattered between somatic epithelial cells. The hatchling medulla shows fragmentation indicative of the formation of lacunae. By 1 week of age, oocytes form growing nests and show increased interactions with somatic cells, indicative of the initiation of folliculogenesis. Medullary lacunae increase in diameter and contain secretory material in their lumen. At 1 month, nest sizes and lacunar diameters continue to enlarge. Pachytene oocytes surrounded by somatic cells are more frequent. Trabeculae composed of dense irregular connective tissue divide cortical nests. Three months after hatching oocytes in meiotic stages of prophase I up to diplotene are present. The ovary displays many enlarged follicles with oocytes in diplotene arrest, thecal layers, lampbrush chromosomes, and complete layers of follicular cells. The medulla is an elaborated complex of vascularized lacunae underlying the cortex and often containing discrete lymphoid aggregates. While the general morphology of the alligator ovary is similar to that of the chicken ovary, the progression of oogenesis and folliculogenesis around hatching is notably slower in alligators.

Histochemical tests were employed to identify the main metabolites on nectary tissue and secretion samples.\nThe floral nectary consists of the inner epidermis of the hypanthium and vascularized parenchyma. Some evidence indicates that the nectar release occurs via the stomata. The high populations of mitochondria, and their juxtaposition with amyloplasts, seem to be related to energy needs for starch hydrolysis. Among the alterations observed during the secretory phase, the reduction in the plastid stromatic density and starch grain size are highlighted. When the secretory stage begins, the plastid envelope disappears and a new membrane is formed, enclosing this region and giving rise to new vacuoles. After the secretory stage, cellular structures named 'extrastomatic bodies' were observed and seem to be related to the nectar resorption.\nStarch hydrolysis contributes to nectar formation, in addition to the photosynthates derived directly from the phloem. In these nectaries, the secretion is an energy-requiring process. During the secretion stage, some plastids show starch grain hydrolysis and membrane rupture, and it was observed that the region previously occupied by this organelle continued to be reasonably well defined, and gave rise to new vacuoles.

We present the case of a thirteen-year-old lady with neurofibromatosis type 1 who developed a dystrophic thoracic kyphoscoliosis. A T9 compression due to a severe scaloping of the thoracic spine caused an important deformation and a medullar compression (with dorsal pain, right sciatica and a pyramidal syndrome). The surgery consisted in medullar liberation by a T9-T10 corporectomy and an osteosynthesis with arthrodesis T3-L3. A free vascularized fibula bone graft, with an end-to-end anastomosis on a thoracic pedicle, was realized to fill the T8-T11 spinal defect. All the symptoms decreased after surgery and the patient could walk normally few months later. At one-year follow-up the radiographs showed a stable montage and a solid bony fusion. Analysing the literature, vascularized bone graft can be recommended to fill the bony spinal defect due to surgery in cases of tumor, infection, trauma or severe scoliosis. Compared to non-vascularized grafts, which are exposed to resorption, fatigue fracture and then instability, the vascularized fibula grafts provide a rapid fusion, a biomechanically stable and long-standing support with low risks of infection.", "journal": "Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique", "date": "2007-10-24", "authors": ["LBourdais", "AHamel", "OHamel", "MPannier", "FDuteille"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anplas.2007.05.005"}
{"title": "Endometriosis as a neurovascular condition: estrous variations in innervation, vascularization, and growth factor content of ectopic endometrial cysts in the rat.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is a poorly understood, estradiol-dependent condition associated with severe pelvic pains and defined by vascularized endometrial growths outside the uterus. Endometriosis is produced in cycling rats by autotransplanting pieces of uterus onto abdominal arteries where they develop into cysts. The surgery induces vaginal and abdominal muscle hyperalgesia, whose severity is greatest in proestrus and nearly absent in estrus. The cysts contain growth factors and cytokines and develop their own sympathetic and sensory C- and Adelta-fiber innervation. Here, we used quantitative immunostaining and protein array analyses to test the hypothesis that the innervation and growth factor/cytokine content of the cysts, but not uterine horn, contribute to proestrous-to-estrous changes in hyperalgesic severity. If so, these characteristics in the cysts, but not the uterine horn, should change with estrous stage. In cysts, the density of sympathetic (but not sensory) neurites and amounts of NGF and VEGF proteins (but not cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, or TNF-alpha) were greater in proestrus than estrus. These changes were accompanied by vascular changes. Both sympathetic and sensory fibers in both stages colabeled with TrkA, indicating that changes in NGF could act on both afferent and efferent fibers. In contrast with the cysts, no changes occurred in the uterine horn between proestrus and estrus. Together, these results suggest that coordinated proestrous-to-estrous changes in innervation and vascularization of the cysts contribute to similar changes in hyperalgesic severity. The findings also encourage consideration of endometriosis as a neurovascular condition.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Thirty Japanese white rabbits were used. To make a prefabricated bone graft, the saphenous artery and vein were passed through the hole of the IP-CHA. Hundred micrograms of FGF-2 was administered into the IP-CHA before implanting the vascular bundle. First and foremost, the IP-CHA was placed subcutaneously in the medial thigh of rabbits for 4 weeks. In the experimental group, a prefabricated vascularized bone graft was used while IP-CHA alone was used in the control group. Second, the prefabricated vascularized bone graft was transplanted from the subcutaneous implanted site into the medial femoral condyle defect of the same rabbit and IP-CHA alone was implanted as the control graft in a different animal. At 4 weeks posttransplantation, bone union with host bone could be observed in the experimental group. However, the area of bone formation of the control group was significantly higher than in the experimental at 2 and 4 weeks posttransplantation.

{"title": "Hybrid bone implants: self-assembly of peptide amphiphile nanofibers within porous titanium.", "abstract": "Over the past few decades there has been great interest in the use of orthopedic and dental implants that integrate into tissue by promoting bone ingrowth or bone adhesion, thereby eliminating the need for cement fixation. However, strategies to create bioactive implant surfaces to direct cellular activity and mineralization leading to osteointegration are lacking. We report here on a method to prepare a hybrid bone implant material consisting of a Ti-6Al-4V foam, whose 52% porosity is filled with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofiber matrix. These PA nanofibers can be highly bioactive by molecular design, and are used here as a strategy to transform an inert titanium foam into a potentially bioactive implant. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy, we show that PA molecules self-assemble into a nanofiber matrix within the pores of the metallic foam, fully occupying the foam's interconnected porosity. Furthermore, the method allows the encapsulation of cells within the bioactive matrix, and under appropriate conditions the nanofibers can nucleate mineralization of calcium phosphate phases with a Ca:P ratio that corresponds to that of hydroxyapatite. Cell encapsulation was quantified using a DNA measuring assay and qualitatively verified by SEM and confocal microscopy. An in vivo experiment was performed using a bone plug model in the diaphysis of the hind femurs of a Sprague Dawley rat and examined by histology to evaluate the performance of these hybrid systems after 4 weeks of implantation. Preliminary results demonstrate de novo bone formation around and inside the implant, vascularization around the implant, as well as the absence of a cytotoxic response. The PA-Ti hybrid strategy could be potentially tailored to initiate mineralization and direct a cellular response from the host tissue into porous implants to form new bone and thereby improve fixation, osteointegration, and long term stability of implants.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2007-10-16", "authors": ["Timothy DSargeant", "Mustafa OGuler", "Scott MOppenheimer", "AlvaroMata", "Robert LSatcher", "David CDunand", "Samuel IStupp"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.09.012"}
{"title": "The effect of cross-linking of collagen matrices on their angiogenic capability.", "abstract": "The poor vascularization rate of matrices following cell invasion is considered to be one of the main shortcomings of scaffolds used in tissue engineering. In the past decade much effort has been directed towards enhancing the angiogenic potential of biomaterials. A great many studies have appeared reporting about enhancement of vascularization by immobilizing angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). We have also tried to achieve this goal by modifying collagen matrices by covalent incorporation of heparin into the matrices and loading them with VEGF. We and others have observed that loading angiogenic factors to heparinized materials markedly increases angiogenic capacity. In the present paper we also investigated the angiogenic properties of collagen matrices which were only cross-linked, i.e. in the absence of heparin. The angiogenic capacity of the modified matrices was evaluated using the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Differences in angiogenic potential were deduced from macroscopic and microscopic analyses of the chorioallantoic membrane, as well as from dry weight changes. Cross-linked only matrices and matrices both cross-linked and heparinized appeared to show a significantly larger angiogenic potential than unmodified matrices. As previously observed, loading VEGF to these matrices further stepped up angiogenic potential. Quite surprisingly, cross-linking had a substantial impact on angiogenic potential. In terms of magnitude, this effect was similar to the effect of loading VEGF to heparinized matrices. Both modification procedures resulted in an increase of average pore size within the collagen matrices, and this observation may explain the more rapid invasion of mouse fibroblasts into cross-linked and heparinized matrices. Form changes of the implants were also monitored during the in vivo contacts: cross-linked and heparinized matrices showed far better resistance against contraction, as compared to unmodified matrices. Results from the chorioallantoic membrane assay experiments were compared with data obtained from rat model experiments, which confirmed the results from the chorioallantoic membrane assay. This relatively simple assay was again shown to be extremely helpful in evaluating and predicting the angiogenic capabilities of biomaterials for use in tissue engineering and wound healing.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2007-10-16", "authors": ["ChangYao", "MartaMarkowicz", "NorbertPallua", "Ernst MagnusNoah", "GuySteffens"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.08.049"}
{"title": "Female infertility and disrupted angiogenesis are actions of specific follistatin isoforms.", "abstract": "The circulating and tissue-bound forms of follistatin (FST315 and FST288, respectively) modulate the actions of activins. FST knockout (KO/null) mice, lacking both isoforms, die perinatally with defects in lung, skin, and the musculoskeletal system. Using constructs of the human FST gene engineered to enable expression of each isoform under the control of natural regulatory elements, transgenic mouse lines were created and crossed with FST null mice to attempt to rescue the neonatal lethality. FST288 expression alone did not rescue the neonatal lethality, but mice expressing FST315 on the KO background survived to adulthood with normal lung and skin morphology and partial reversal of the musculoskeletal defects noted in FST KO mice. The FST315 rescue mice displayed a short period of neonatal growth retardation, impaired tail growth, and female infertility. The latter may be due to failure of corpus luteum formation, a decline in the ovarian follicular population, and an augmented uterine inflammatory response to mating. Failure of corpus luteum formation and impaired tail growth indicate abnormal vascularization and suggest that FST288 is required for the promotion of angiogenesis. The augmented uterine inflammatory response may result from the failure of FST315 to modulate the proinflammatory actions of activin A in the uterus or may result from the altered steroid milieu associated with the ovarian abnormalities. Although we cannot definitively conclude that the remaining defects are due to the absence of a particular isoform or due to variable expression of each, these models have demonstrated novel physiological processes that are influenced by FST.", "journal": "Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)", "date": "2007-10-13", "authors": ["Shyr-YeuLin", "Rebecca GCraythorn", "Anne EO'Connor", "Martin MMatzuk", "Jane EGirling", "John RMorrison", "David Mde Kretser"], "doi": "10.1210/me.2006-0529"}

Tumor progression was associated with elevated microvascular permeability and an initial angiogenic wave followed by decreased vessel density combined with reduced tissue perfusion due to loss in small vessels and development of heterogenous tumor vascularization. Following altered geometric resistance of microcirculation, leukocyte-endothelium interactions were more frequent without increased leukocyte extravasation.

{"title": "Role of Shigella infection in endometriosis: a novel hypothesis.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial cells and stroma at ectopic sites outside the uterine cavity. The natural history of endometriosis is uncertain, its etiology unknown, the clinical presentation inconsistent, diagnosis difficult and the treatment poorly standardized. It causes significant morbidity due to pelvic pain and infertility among 15-25% of women during their reproductive age. The benign disease causes peritoneal inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions and ovarian cysts but displays features of malignancy, like neo-vascularization, local invasion and distant metastasis. Mechanical, hormonal, immunological, environmental and genetic factors have been implicated in its etiology but provide inconclusive explanations. Present study was carried out on ectopic and eutopic endometriotic tissue specimens collected during laproscopy/laprotomy from cases of endometriosis. mRNA was isolated from the tissues and converted to cDNA by RT and subsequently subjected to differential display Polymerase Chain Reaction using seven sets of arbitrary primers. A unique band was identified only in the ectopic endometriotic tissue, which was sequenced. BLAST search results revealed sequence homology to shigella bacterial DNA leading us to hypothesize that infection may be playing a role in the etiology of endometriosis. This is the first report implicating the role of bacterial infection in the etiology of endometriosis. Shigella is known to invade the mucosa of the colon through the feco-oral route causing Shigellosis. The pathogenesis of shigellosis involves inflammation, ulceration, haemorrhage, tissue destruction and fibrosis of the colonic mucosa resulting in abdominal pain and diarrhoea/dysentery, this is similar to the pathogenesis of endometriosis which also involves inflammation, haemorrhage, tissue destruction and fibrotic adhesions of the pelvic peritoneum resulting in abdominal pain and infertility. The non-motile shigella bacteria invade the deeper mucosal layers by travelling from cell to cell of colonic epithelium, reaching the lamina propria of the colonic mucosa. We propose that, by the same mechanism, the bacteria travel across the colon wall to reach the outer peritoneal surface of the colon, which is in close proximity to the posterior uterine surface in the Pouch of Douglas, the site which incidentally happens to be the commonest site of early endometriosis. Our hypothesis therefore proposes that shigella or shigella-like organisms may be the trigger for the initiation of immunological changes in the pelvic peritoneum causing endometriosis. Once the endometrial cells are implanted at ectopic sites they are sustained by hormones and angiogenic factors. Hence \"Infection hypothesis\" provides a novel explanation for the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-09-25", "authors": ["V LKodati", "SGovindan", "SMovva", "SPonnala", "QHasan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2007.06.012"}

Its fetal portion is the largest part develops from the chorionic sac. The maternal portion, which is smaller, is originated in the endometrium, more specifically in the decidua basalis. The placenta starts its function closer to the fourth week of gestation, when anatomical arrangements for the physiological exchanges are already established. The circulatory function of the placenta appears at an early stage of embryo-placental development and it is strongly related to fetal growth, to the placental size and to uterine and umbilical blood flows. Therefore, an adequate placental angiogenesis is critical for the establishment of a normal placental vascularization with consequent normal development of the fetus. In this review article, the authors discuss about placental ontogeny, focusing on the main aspects of its normal development, and about the recent advances in ultrasonography for the study of the vascular architecture of the placenta through three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography.", "journal": "Archives of gynecology and obstetrics", "date": "2007-09-19", "authors": ["H\u00e9lio AntonioGuimar\u00e3es Filho", "Lavoisier Linhares Diasda Costa", "EdwardAra\u00fajo J\u00fanior", "Luciano Marcondes MachadoNardozza", "Paulo MartinNowak", "Antonio FernandesMoron", "RosianeMattar", "Cl\u00e1udio RodriguesPires"], "doi": "10.1007/s00404-007-0453-y"}
{"title": "Mechanism of decongestant activity of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists.", "abstract": "The vascular bed in nasal mucosa of different species, including human, is highly vascularized and an extensive sinusoidal network of large capacitance vessels is present deep within the submucosa. When this network of venous sinusoids is engorged with blood, the swollen mucosa reduces the size of the airway lumen and congestion ensues. Nasal vasculature tone is strongly influenced by the sympathetic nervous system and the only drugs approved specifically to relieve vascular nasal obstruction are alpha-adrenoceptor sympathomimetic agents. Due to their vasoconstrictor action, the sympathomimetic decongestants oppose vasodilation, reducing nasal airway resistance and thus facilitating nose breathing. However, standard decongestants that are non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists are associated with the potential for side-effect liabilities including hypertension, stroke, insomnia and nervousness. We propose than a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, by acting preferentially on nasal venous capacitance vessels, will elicit decongestion with a reduced side-effect liability. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT-920 in a real-time tissue contractility assay using isolated pig nasal explants and in an in vivo cat model of congestion. The vasoconstrictor and decongestant effects of BHT-920 were compared to the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist epinephrine and the standard decongestant oxymetazoline. Our results showed that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT-920 preferentially contracts venous sinusoids confirming previous observations [Corboz MR, Varty LM, Rivelli MA, Mutter JC, Mingo G, McLeod R, et al.

Therefore, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, by causing constriction in the capacitance vessels of nasal mucosa, can produce nasal decongestion without the effects on blood pressure observed with the standard selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor and non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor sympathomimetic decongestants.", "journal": "Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics", "date": "2007-09-18", "authors": ["M RCorboz", "M ARivelli", "G GMingo", "R LMcLeod", "LVarty", "YJia", "J AHey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pupt.2007.06.007"}

Material consisting of a soluble chitosan (CH-LA) mixed with fucoidan yielded a water-insoluble and injectable hydrogel with filamentous particles. In this study, we examined the ability of the chitosan/fucoidan complex-hydrogel to immobilize FGF-2 and to protect its activity, as well as the controlled release of FGF-2 molecules. The chitosan/fucoidan complex-hydrogel has high affinity for FGF-2 (K(d) = 5.4 x 10(-) (9)M). The interaction of FGF-2 with chitosan/fucoidan complex-hydrogel substantially prolonged the biological half-life time of FGF-2. It also protected FGF-2 from inactivation, for example by heat and proteolysis, and enhance FGF-2 activity. When FGF-2-containing complex-hydrogel was subcutaneously injected into the back of mice, significant neovascularization and fibrous tissue formation were induced near the site of injection at 1 week, and the complex-hydrogel was biodegraded and disappeared by 4 weeks. These findings indicate that controlled release of biologically active FGF-2 molecules is caused by both slow diffusion and biodegradation of the complex-hydrogel, and that subsequent induction of vascularization occurs. FGF-2-containing chitosan/fucoidan micro complex-hydrogel is thus useful and convenient for treatment of ischemic disease.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Patients who underwent this procedure were asked to answer questions concerning the birth of a child, natural breastfeeding, and the reasons why natural breastfeeding was not performed or was interrupted.\nBetween 1992 and 2001, 368 reduction mammaplasties were performed in the Department of Plastic Surgery at the \"La Sapienza\" University of Rome. After reduction mammaplasty, 105 patients had a child and were enrolled in the study. Breastfeeding data were compared with data from hospital records at the time of surgery in terms of patient age, reduction mammaplasty technique, sensitivity of the nipple-areola complex after the operation, and proportion of the gland removed.\nMaternal breastfeeding was considered to have occurred if it lasted more than 3 weeks and was not accompanied by any nutritional supplements. Babies were breastfed by 60.7% of the patients who underwent a superior pedicle reduction mammaplasty, by 43.5% of those who underwent an inferior pedicle reduction mammaplasty, by 48% of those who underwent a medial pedicle reduction mammaplasty, and by 55.1% of those who underwent a lateral pedicle reduction mammaplasty.\nThe findings demonstrate that conservative reduction mammaplasty techniques supported by medical and paramedical staff permit subsequent breastfeeding.

{"title": "Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by cell-permeable dominant negative SOX18 mutants.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis play a key roles in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis, and has become an attractive target for anticancer drug development. Though a number of anti-angiogenic agents had entered clinical trials, few of them could reproduce the spectacular results in cancer patients as that had been seen in pre-clinical tumor models. Therefore, exploring novel anti-angiogenic agents is highly deserved. SOX18, a member of the Sry-related HMG box-containing family of transcription factors, is expressed transiently in endothelial cells during the development of blood vessels. And mutations resulting in expression of dominant negative SOX18 have been shown to severely impair the vascular development. Recent research demonstrated that SOX18 is expressed during the initial steps of tumor vascularization and involved in regulation of the expression of the VEGF receptor Flk-1 and the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Moreover, allograft tumor growth in mice heterozygous for Ra(Op) (RaOp mice) which express a dominant negative mutant form of SOX18 (SOX18RaOp) that does not interact effectively with the endothelial partner protein MEF2C, was dramatically slower than that of wild-type mice. In this article, we postulate that recombinant cell-permeable dominant negative SOX18 mutants, prepared by fusion with protein transduction domains, would inhibit tumor angiogenesis with high efficiency by impairing endothelial tube formation. If the hypothesis was proved to be practical, the fusion proteins would show promise as single anti-angiogenic agents in cancer therapy.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-09-05", "authors": ["MinLuo", "Xiao-TongGuo", "WeiYang", "Liang-QiLiu", "Li-WenLi", "Xiao-YanXin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2007.07.024"}
{"title": "MR guided cancer treatment system for an elevated therapeutic index - a macroscopic approach.", "abstract": "Adjuvant therapy for cancer usually refers to surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment to decrease the risk of recurrence. But still, the absolute benefit for survival obtained with adjuvant therapy compared with control is only approximately 6%. The objective of this analysis is to formulate a non-invasive multimodal cancer treatment system related to cancer stem cells and hypoxic fractions of solid tumors, emphasizing MRI monitoring and guidance, to elevate the therapeutic index. Tumor hypoxia is a therapeutic concern since it can reduce the effectiveness of drugs and radiotherapy, where well oxygenated cells requiring one third of the dose of hypoxic cells to achieve a given level of cell killing. Cancer stem cells might be the cause of tumor recurrence, sometimes many years after the appearance of the successful treatment of a primary tumor. Thus, the primary objective of such a treatment system will be to provide sufficient selective toxicity to both kill cancer stem cells and cells of hypoxic fractions of the tumor. Active tumor targeting with the use of liposomally encapsulated drugs is the starting point of the treatment procedure. The system facilitates quality assurance means by MR monitoring of drug accumulation and drug release, in real time. Cavitation involves the nucleation, growth and oscillation of gaseous cavities. Selective drug release and/or hyperthermia are achieved by ultrasound induced cavitation well defined to the tumor region. Hyperthermic effects, increased vascularization and subsequent increase in pO2 levels to hypoxic regions, can be monitored by MRI. MRI monitoring of key physiological parameters facilitates optimization related to approximate real time concomitant treatments, including correct timing and various combinations of drug therapy, hyperthermia, ionizing radiation, ablation, other treatment options, before or after surgery. The likelihood of an improved therapeutic index with the use of such a system seems compelling.

{"title": "Review of various techniques of pancreas transplantation in rat model.", "abstract": "Pancreas transplantation (PTx) is being applied with increasing frequency in the treatment of diabetes mellitus Type 1 and selected cases of Type 2. It is known that PTx can consistently establish normoglycemic insulin-independent state. Due to the increased use of different PTx models in rats for studying the metabolic function of the transplanted pancreas, reviewing the various techniques in PTx seemed to be necessary. A review of the literature of PTx in rat models showed that different techniques or modifications have been described. Each modification is the result of a change or simplification of three main points: the arterial inflow, the venous outflow, and the management of the exocrine secretory part of the gland. The techniques of PTx vascularization in rats are based on two cardinal models, which include the microsuture and non-suture cuff techniques. In arterial inflow reconstruction, an aortic segment is used. Venous drainage is accomplished by systemic or portal drainage (porto-caval or porto-portal anastomosis). Management of the exocrine part has the most variations. Enteric and urinary diversion, as well as duct ligation or obstruction, are the most important techniques for the management of exocrine part. Regarding vascular anastomosis, the microsuture technique is more popular than the cuff technique. However the cuff technique seems to be simpler. Grafts with portal venous drainage show a lesser probability of hyperinsulinemia and a high level of lipoproteins. In the management of the exocrine part, enteric exocrine drainage is more similar to the physiological setting and is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of acidosis and dehydration. However, enteric diversion is more prone to intestinal bleeding and ileus as well as to bacterial contamination.

The understanding of the molecular mechanisms of BCC formation, which is a prerequisite for the development of efficient new therapies, is still incomplete. The formation of sporadic BCCs in the skin is associated with uncontrolled hedgehog signaling, and the transcription factor Gli2 has been identified as a key mediator or effector of this signaling. There is indication in the literature that preventing Gli2 function may inhibit BCC formation and growth in vivo; however, the mechanism is unclear and difficult to study in humans. Therefore, we used a mouse tumor allograft model to investigate the role of Gli2 in tumor formation. A constitutively Gli2 expressing mouse tumor cell line was stably transfected with Gli2-specific shRNA to induce Gli2 gene silencing or with control shRNA. Injecting the Gli2 gene silenced cells into nude mice for tumor formation we detected a strongly retarded tumor growth compared with control tumor cells. Investigating the mechanisms, we found that Gli2 gene silencing has led to the disruption of the tumor structure as demonstrated by staining tumor sections with hematoxylin. Two main reasons for the tumor destruction were identified. We found that apoptosis was markedly increased while vascularization was strongly decreased in these tumors. Thus, important functions of the transcription factor Gli2 in this tumor model are the prevention of apoptosis and the promotion of microvascularization.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2007-08-28", "authors": ["JingminJi", "ErwinKump", "MarionWernli", "PeterErb"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.23023"}

Histogram indices of the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization-flow index (VFI) for the intra-tumor and for shells with a thickness of 3 mm surrounding the breast lesion were calculated and showed that for both, malignancy had a higher VI, FI and VFI than benignancy, with statistical significance. Multivariate and stepwise logistic regression revealed the model (including patient age, volume and intra-tumor FI in 3D power Doppler vascularity) to be the best choice for malignant breast tumor characterization. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) index for the performance of the model was 0.926.

Implanted cylinders were retrieved at the same time as the removal of the blade plates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Scanning electron microscopy and histological evaluations were performed to observe the biological responses of human bone tissue to porous Bonelike. The penetration depth was determined for all implantation periods, and after 6 months it was already possible to see new bone in the centre of the implanted cylinders, which gives 100% of penetration depth for all implantations periods except for 3 months when bone could only be seen in the peripherical region. Regarding the percentage of the area covered by new bone calculated from two-dimensional histological sections, values of 53+/-15, 76+/-12 and 88+/-9% were achieved for 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively.

We have further investigated the role of Stat3 in epithelial carcinogenesis using mice in which the expression of a constitutively active/dimerized form of Stat3 (Stat3C) is targeted to the proliferative compartment of epidermis (referred to as K5.Stat3C transgenic mice). Keratinocytes from K5.Stat3C mice showed increased survival following exposure to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and enhanced proliferation following exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In two-stage chemical carcinogenesis experiments using DMBA as the tumor initiator and TPA as the promoter, K5.Stat3C mice developed skin tumors with a shorter latency and in much greater number compared to non-transgenic littermates. Remarkably, 100% of the skin tumors that developed in K5.Stat3C transgenic mice bypassed the premalignant stage and were initially diagnosed as carcinoma in situ which rapidly progressed to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). These tumors were highly vascularized, poorly differentiated and invasive and loss of expression of K10, filaggrin and E-cadherin was observed by 20 weeks. Finally, overexpression of Stat3C in a papilloma cell line led to enhanced cell migration and enhanced invasion through Matrigel in both the absence and presence of growth factors.

The method is particularly useful for measuring the velocity and direction of blood flow in individual vessel segments of normal and malignant tissues and the blood supply time (BST) of individual tumor vessel segments; i.e., the time required for arterial blood to flow from a supplying tumor artery to a downstream microvessel segment.

In the present study, we investigated whether the vascularization of implanted poly-D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds may be accelerated by incorporation of Matrigel. For this purpose, we investigated in the aortic ring assay the proangiogenic properties of growth factor reduced Matrigel (GFRM) and growth factor containing Matrigel (GFCM), which were then incorporated into the pores of PLGA scaffolds. Subsequently, we analyzed vascularization, biocompatibility, and incorporation of these scaffolds during 14 days after implantation into dorsal skinfold chambers of balb/c mice by means of intravital microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Matrigel-free scaffolds served as controls. In the aortic ring assay, GFCM stimulated the development of a network of tubular vessel structures with a significantly increased sprout area and density when compared with GFRM. Accordingly, GFCM accelerated and improved in vivo the ingrowth of new blood vessels into scaffolds, resulting in the formation of a pericyte-coated vascular network with an increased functional capillary density in comparison to the GFRM and control group. Besides, analysis of leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction in host tissue venules located in close vicinity to the scaffolds showed no marked differences in numbers of rolling and adherent leukocytes between the observation groups, indicating that incorporation of Matrigel did not affect biocompatibility of PLGA scaffolds.

{"title": "Modern reconstruction techniques for oral and pharyngeal defects after tumor resection.", "abstract": "Several techniques have been developed to reconstruct oral and pharyngeal defects following surgery, in order to restore function and cosmesis. These are primary closure, skin grafts, local transposition of skin, mucosa and/or muscle, regional flaps and free vascularized flaps. Because of the 'bulky', pedicled nature and problems with the donor area of locoregional flaps, and consequently frequently unsatisfactory functional results, free vascularized flaps have gained popularity during the last decade. The authors review the current options available to give physicians, who are not experienced in the field of reconstruction in the head and neck, an impression of the range of techniques available for reconstruction of oral and pharyngeal defects following tumor resection. For reconstruction of oral cavity and pharyngeal defects, fasciocutaneous (e.g. radial forearm and anterolateral thigh flaps) and myocutaneous free flaps (e.g. rectus abdominis and latissimus dorsi) have proven to be very reliable.

{"title": "Zymosan-induced inflammation stimulates neo-adipogenesis.", "abstract": "To investigate the potential of inflammation to induce new adipose tissue formation in the in vivo environment.\nUsing an established model of in vivo adipogenesis, a silicone chamber containing a Matrigel and fibroblast growth factor 2 (1 microg/ml) matrix was implanted into each groin of an adult male C57Bl6 mouse and vascularized with the inferior epigastric vessels. Sterile inflammation was induced in one of the two chambers by suspending Zymosan-A (ZA) (200-0.02 microg/ml) in the matrix at implantation. Adipose tissue formation was assessed at 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. ZA induced significant adipogenesis in an inverse dose-dependent manner (P<0.001). At 6 weeks adipose tissue formation was greatest with the lowest concentrations of ZA and least with the highest. Adipogenesis occurred both locally in the chamber containing ZA and in the ZA-free chamber in the contralateral groin of the same animal. ZA induced a systemic inflammatory response characterized by elevated serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels at early time points. Aminoguanidine (40 microg/ml) inhibited the adipogenic response to ZA-induced inflammation. Adipose tissue formed in response to ZA remained stable for 24 weeks, even when exposed to the normal tissue environment.\nThese results demonstrate that inflammation can drive neo-adipogenesis in vivo. This suggests the existence of a positive feedback mechanism in obesity, whereby the state of chronic, low-grade inflammation, characteristic of the condition, may promote further adipogenesis. The mobilization and recruitment of a circulating population of adipose precursor cells is likely to be implicated in this mechanism.", "journal": "International journal of obesity (2005)", "date": "2007-08-09", "authors": ["G P LThomas", "KHemmrich", "K MAbberton", "DMcCombe", "A JPenington", "E WThompson", "W AMorrison"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.ijo.0803702"}

Stem cells were challenged with each engineered surface, either in plane cultures or in a rotating apparatus, for a month. Gingival fibroblasts were used as controls. Results showed that stem cells exerted a different response, depending on the different type of textured surface: in fact, microconcavities significantly affected SBP-DPSC differentiation into osteoblasts, both temporally and quantitatively, with respect to the other textured surfaces. Actually, stem cells challenged with concave surfaces differentiated quicker and showed nuclear polarity, an index of secretion, cellular activity and matrix formation. Moreover, bone-specific proteins were significantly expressed and the obtained bone tissue was of significant thickness. Thus, cells cultured on the concave textured surface had better cell-scaffold interactions and were induced to secrete factors that, due to their autocrine effects, quickly lead to osteodifferentiation, bone tissue formation, and vascularization. The worst cell performance was obtained using convex surfaces, due to the scarce cell proliferation on to the scaffold and the poor matrix secretion.

Herein we studied how liver resection-associated MIP-2 affects extrahepatic tumor cell engraftment and whether MIP-2 also stimulates the growth of already established metastases.\nGreen fluorescent protein-transfected CT26.WT colorectal cancer cells were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of syngeneic BALB/c mice. Additionally, all animals underwent a 30% hepatectomy. To study MIP-2 in extrahepatic tumor cell engraftment, animals were treated with an anti-MIP-2 antibody, starting at the day of tumor cell implantation. To study MIP-2 in established metastases, anti-MIP-2 treatment was initiated at day 5 after tumor cell implantation. Hepatectomized animals without neutralization of MIP-2 served as controls. Tumor vascularization and growth as well as tumor cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and CXCR-2 expression were studied over 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry.\nFunctional inhibition of MIP-2 significantly delayed extrahepatic tumor cell engraftment but not the growth of established metastases. The initial delay of engraftment was associated with a compensatory stimulation of vascularization and tumor cell migration when compared to controls (P < 0.05). Further, inhibition of tumor cell engraftment by initial anti-MIP-2 treatment was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of CXCR-2 expression and tumor cell apoptosis.\nOur study indicates that MIP-2 is involved in extrahepatic engraftment of CT.26 colorectal cancer cells.

After the diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy, the patient immediately received preoperative chemotherapy including high-dose Methotrexate, Cisplatin and Doxrubicin. Imagings after preoperative chemotherapy including MRI and contrasted enhanced CT confirmed no tumor penetration into the physis. Subsequently, we performed transepiphyseal resection of the proximal tibia to reserve the joint surface. The intercalary twin-barreled vascularized fibular graft was placed with hydroxyapatite composites. The patella tendon was reattached to the grafted fibular to biologically reconstruct the knee extensor mechanism.

{"title": "Clinicopathologic significance of tumor cell-lined vessel and microenvironment in oral squamous cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be vascularized through a process called \"tumor cell-lined vessels\". Currently, the tumor microenvironment, which is recognized as hypoxic and orchestrated largely by inflammatory cells and defective blood vessels, is considered an important participant in the neoplastic process. We sought to determine their clinicopathologic significance and prognostic implication in oral SCC. Vascular structure was investigated by multistaining with pan-cytokeratin, CD34, and alpha-smooth actin/type IV collagen. Immunohistochemical staining of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and CD68 was used to reflect hypoxia and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Our results showed that in a high percentage of vessels in cancer tissue. There is absence of pericyte coverage and loss of basement membrane lining. Significant association between the integrity of vascular structure and lymph node involvement and presence of tumor cell-lined vessel was found. HIF-1 alpha overexpression was frequently observed in cancer cells (78/112) and correlated with tumor progress index. In cancer tissues, the TAM ranged from 28 to 296 cells/mm2 with a mean of 144.6+/-64.3 cells/mm2. There was a significant correlation between TAM and lymph node involvement (P=0.004) and tumor size (P=0.004). Also, a close association was found between TAM count and integrity of vascular structure. In addition, survival analysis revealed that tumor cell-lined vessels (P=0.001), HIF-1 alpha expression (P=0.004), and TAM (P=0.001) correlated significantly with poor survival. We conclude that in the cancer microenvironment, HIF-1 alpha expression and the TAM are induced and contributed to malignant behavior of tumor cells.
