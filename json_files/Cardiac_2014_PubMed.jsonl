Accumulation of AGEs contribute to tissue stiffness and organ dysfunction by crosslinking extracellular matrix proteins like collagen. We aimed to assess whether AGE-modified cardiac tissue collagen and AGE related skin autofluorescence may reflect the cardiac function and have a prognostic value for the outcome of coronary artery bypass surgery patients. Therefore, AGE-modifications in collagen from 72 male patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were analyzed. Collagen fractions were isolated from the right atrial auricle and the residual bypass graft material (saphenous vein) of these patients and quantified by 4-hydroxyproline assay. AGE modifications were determined by the AGE intrinsic fluorescence (excitation 360nm/emission 440nm). The skin autofluorescence (sAF) as a non-invasive parameter was measured using the AGE reader. The non-extractable collagen contained the highest amounts of AGEs and positively correlates with the patients age (p=0.0001), blood glucose level (p=0.002), HbA1c level (p=0.01) and sAF (p=0.008). The right atrial auricle collagen showed significantly more modifications compared to vein graft material of the same patient (p=0,001).

Results shown: in the endocardial ablation, the existence of the fat layer did not affect the shape of the 50\u2009\u00b0C contour before 30\u2009s. The increase speed of depth became quite slowly in the model with fat layer after 30\u2009s. When ablation depth needed fixed, there are no significant effect on effectively ablation depth whether fat layer over or not. However, the existence of fat layer makes the temperature lower in the myocardium, and maximum temperature point closer to the myocardium surface. What is more, in the model with fat layer, effective ablation reach lower maximum temperature and the shallower depth of 50\u2009\u00b0C contour. But there are larger ablation axial length and transverse width. In this case, doctor should ensure safety of normal cardiac tissue around the target tissue. In the epicardial ablation, the existence of fat layer seriously affects result of the microwave ablation. The epicardial ablation needs more heating time to create lesion. But epicardial ablation can be better controlled in the shape of effective ablation area because of the slowly increase of target variables after the appearing of 50\u2009\u00b0C contour.

GTS significantly increased aortic flow, coronary flow, and cardiac output. Moreover, GTS significantly increased left ventricular systolic pressure and the maximal rate of contraction (+dP/dt max) and relaxation (-dP/dt max). In addition, GTS has been shown to ameliorate electrocardiographic changes such as the QRS complex, QT interval, and RR interval.\nGTS significantly suppressed the biochemical parameters (i.e., lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-MB fraction, and cardiac troponin I levels) and normalized the oxidative stress markers (i.e., malondialdehyde, glutathione, and nitrite). In addition, GTS also markedly inhibits the expression of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and nuclear factor-\u03baB, and improves the expression of IL-10 in cardiac tissue.\nThese data indicate that GTS mitigates myocardial damage by modulating the biochemical and oxidative stress related to cardiac I/R injury.", "journal": "Journal of ginseng research", "date": "2015-07-23", "authors": ["AdithanAravinthan", "Jong HanKim", "PaulrayerAntonisamy", "Chang-WonKang", "JongheeChoi", "Nam SooKim", "Jong-HoonKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jgr.2014.12.001"}

Another challenge lies in the limitations of small animal models in replicating the human heart.

Operative therapeutic modalities such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may enhance myocardial perfusion in high-grade coronary vasculature occlusions. It has been shown previously that Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) significantly reduces infarct size following induction of myocardial infarction in rats and dogs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LLLT on cardiac tissue healing markers following grafting operations for coronary vessel occlusion.\nThirty-two cases having each two or three coronary vessel occlusions (2VD/3VD) underwent low-level laser therapy post-CABG, and 28 patients who did not undergo laser therapy were studied as a control group. Diode laser (810 nm, 500 mW) was used as LLLT protocol for 3 successive days post-CABG. Repeated measurements of blood cell count (CBC) and cardiac damage markers (CPK, CPK-MB, LDH) attained before CABG and during the 5 days of LLLT post-operatively, taken at one and 12 hours after daily laser irradiation.\nIn a comparison of the mean levels of the control and laser group, the variables were statistically different on 5(th) day after intervention for WBC, Neutrophil and Lymphocyte counts and WBC and lymphocyte changes. A statistically significant difference was seen in changes of CPK, CPK-mb and LDH over time P<0.001.\nIt is concluded that low-level laser irradiation after CABG surgery could decrease cardiac cellular damage and help accelerate the repair of cardiac tissue post-operatively.

Isoproterenol (ISP), a synthetic catecholamine has been widely employed to induce myocardial injury, though the role of inflammation and apoptosis is not well established. This study was designed to investigate the underlying mechanism of oxidative damage, inflammatory signaling, cell death in ISP induced myocardial infarction in rats. Wistar albino rats were divided in two groups: group I (sham control) and group II (ischemic control). ISP (85\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) was administered at an interval of 24\u00a0h to group II for two consecutive days. On day third, after 48\u00a0h of the first injection of ISP, blood was collected from retro orbital plexus of rat eyes to estimate the biochemical parameters. Glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured for antioxidant status. Similarly, malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured as an index of lipid peroxidation. Cardiac markers (SGOT, CK-MB, TropI and LDH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CRP and TNF-\u03b1) were also estimated in ISP-induced rats. At the end of experiments animals were sacrificed for histopathological studies.

However, poor survival and contractility of these cells are a significant bottleneck to their clinical use. To better understand the role of cell-cell communication in enhancing the phenotype and contractile properties of hPSC-CMs, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel composed of hPSC-CMs, human pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hPSC-ECs), and/or human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). The objective of this study was to examine the role of multi-cellular interactions among hPSC-ECs and hAMSCs on the survival and long-term contractile phenotype of hPSC-CMs in a 3D hydrogel. Quantification of spontaneous contractility of hPSC-CMs in tri-culture demonstrated a 6-fold increase in the area of contractile motion after 6 weeks with characteristic rhythmic contraction frequency, when compared to hPSC-CMs alone (P < 0.05). This finding was supported by a statistically significant increase in cardiac troponin T protein expression in the tri-culture hydrogel construct at 6 weeks, when compared to hPSC-CMs alone (P < 0.001). The sustained hPSC-CM survival and contractility in tri-culture was associated with a significant upregulation in the gene expression of L-type Ca(2+) ion channel, Cav1.2, and the inward-rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1 (P < 0.05), suggesting a role of ion channels in mediating these processes.

However, these abnormalities were reversed to near-normal values in the rats administered EGCG. Similarly, the enzymatic antioxidant activity and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels were improved with EGCG treatment in high-fat diet-fed rats. In addition, EGCG activated sirtuin 1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1, which suggests that its protective effect is mediated through the stimulation of lipid metabolism. The histopathological examination further revealed that EGCG significantly prevented the development of tissue abnormalities and improved the morphology of myocardial tissue.

{"title": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress response in spontaneously hypertensive rats is affected by myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Cell apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress appears to be one of the main causes of myocardial necrosis following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). The C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathway is the main pathway through which apoptosis is induced during ER stress. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is an important protein involved in the CHOP pathway. The present study investigated the hypothesis that MI/R activates the CHOP pathway through signaling via a pathway involving PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). Immunohistochemical staining of the heart tissues from spontaneously hypersensitive rats indicated that MI/R injury increases CHOP and GPR78 protein expression levels. To further analyze the mechanism by which MI/R injury induces apoptosis by ER stress, the expression levels of five marker proteins involved in the hypothetical PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF2 pathway were detected, namely PERK, phosphorylated PERK (P-PERK), eIF2\u03b1, phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (P-eIF2\u03b1) and ATF2. An increase in the collective expression levels of these proteins would indicate that apoptosis was induced by this signaling pathway. In addition, the study also explored whether hypertension affects the signaling pathway of MI/R-induced myocardial apoptosis by treating spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with captopril (an effective drug used to treat hypertension). Rats treated with captopril experienced a reduction in blood pressure to normal levels, but no marked differences in the expression levels of the tested proteins or in MI/R injury severity compared with those in untreated rats. These results suggest that MI/R activates the CHOP pathway during ER stress by activating the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF2 pathway and that hypertension does not affect this signaling pathway.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2015-01-13", "authors": ["Xiao-FuGuo", "Xiang-JunYang"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2014.2094\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200002)190:3<255::AID-PATH526>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000606\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.04.052\n10.1007/s00204-014-1240-8\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0945\n10.1007/978-1-4614-3209-8_83\n10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.022\n10.1093/nar/gkm038\n10.1128/MCB.20.19.7192-7204.2000\n10.1128/MCB.00939-10\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2004.04.013\n10.1354/vp.42-4-405\n10.1097/00001756-200302100-00004\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1172/JCI112160\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00033-9\n10.1056/NEJMra071667"}

Therefore, resolution of four-electrode microimpedance spectra (4EMS) may provide an opportunity for routine identification of passive electrical properties for the interstitial and intracellular compartments using only interstitial access. The present study documents a structural framework in which the tissue resistivity (\u03c1t) and reactivity (xt) that comprise spectra are computed using interstitial and intracellular microimpedance distributions that account for differences in compartment size, anisotropic electrical properties in each compartment and electrode separations.

{"title": "Ischemia/reperfusion activates myocardial innate immune response: the key role of the toll-like receptor.", "abstract": "Recent data have indicated that the myocardium may act as an immune organ initiating cardiac innate immune response and inflammation. It has been suggested that activation of the immune system occurs upon the interaction of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated and released during ischemic damage with pattern recognition receptors (Toll like receptors; TLR) present in cardiac cells. Among TLRs, TLR4, and TLR2 are the ones mostly expressed in cardiac tissue. Whereas TLR4 has shown to play a detrimental role in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, the effect elicited by TLR2 activation remains controversial. Once activated, TLR signaling may occur via the Myd88- and Trif- dependent pathways leading to NF\u03baB and IFN-3 activation, respectively, and subsequent stimulation of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine gene expression. Cytokine release contributes to neutrophils activation, recruitment, adhesion and infiltration to the site of cardiac injury further perpetuating the inflammatory process.

We study these dynamics using global and local Lyapunov exponents and spatial trajectory correlations.

{"title": "High frequency stimulation of cardiac myocytes: a theoretical and computational study.", "abstract": "High-frequency stimulation (HFS) has recently been identified as a novel approach for terminating life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. HFS elevates myocyte membrane potential and blocks electrical conduction for the duration of the stimulus. However, low amplitude HFS can induce rapidly firing action potentials, which may reinitiate an arrhythmia. The cellular level mechanisms underlying HFS-induced electrical activity are not well understood. Using a multiscale method, we show that a minimal myocyte model qualitatively reproduces the influence of HFS on cardiac electrical activity. Theoretical analysis and simulations suggest that persistent activation and de-inactivation of ionic currents, in particular a fast inward window current, underlie HFS-induced action potentials and membrane potential elevation, providing hypotheses for future experiments. We derive analytical expressions to describe how HFS modifies ionic current amplitude and gating dynamics. We show how fast inward current parameters influence the parameter regimes for HFS-induced electrical activity, demonstrating how the efficacy of HFS as a therapy for terminating arrhythmias may depend on the presence of pathological conditions or pharmacological treatments. Finally, we demonstrate that HFS terminates cardiac arrhythmias in a one-dimensional ring of cardiac tissue. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to characterize the influence of HFS on ionic current gating dynamics, provide new insight into HFS of the myocardium, and suggest mechanisms underlying HFS-induced electrical activity.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2015-01-03", "authors": ["Seth HWeinberg"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4897618"}

{"title": "Neuronal Na+ channel blockade suppresses arrhythmogenic diastolic Ca2+ release.", "abstract": "Sudden death resulting from cardiac arrhythmias is the most common consequence of cardiac disease. Certain arrhythmias caused by abnormal impulse formation including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) are associated with delayed afterdepolarizations resulting from diastolic Ca2+ release (DCR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Despite high response of CPVT to agents directly affecting Ca2+ cycling, the incidence of refractory cases is still significant. Surprisingly, these patients often respond to treatment with Na+ channel blockers. However, the relationship between Na+ influx and disturbances in Ca2+ handling immediately preceding arrhythmias in CPVT remains poorly understood and is the object of this study.\nWe performed optical Ca2+ and membrane potential imaging in ventricular myocytes and intact cardiac muscles as well as surface ECGs on a CPVT mouse model with a mutation in cardiac calsequestrin. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of Na+ channels (neuronal Na+ channels; nNav) colocalize with ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels (RyR2). Disruption of the crosstalk between nNav and RyR2 by nNav blockade with riluzole reduced and also desynchronized DCR in isolated cardiomyocytes and in intact cardiac tissue. Such desynchronization of DCR on cellular and tissue level translated into decreased arrhythmias in CPVT mice.\nThus, our study offers the first evidence that nNav contribute to arrhythmogenic DCR, thereby providing a conceptual basis for mechanism-based antiarrhythmic therapy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2014-12-30", "authors": ["Przemys\u0142aw BRadwa\u0144ski", "LuciaBrunello", "RengasayeeVeeraraghavan", "Hsiang-TingHo", "QingLou", "Michael AMakara", "Andriy EBelevych", "MirceaAnghelescu", "Silvia GPriori", "PompeoVolpe", "Thomas JHund", "Paul M LJanssen", "Peter JMohler", "John H BBridge", "StevenPoelzing", "S\u00e1ndorGy\u00f6rke"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvu262\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.277699"}

However, LV catalase protein expression and activity were increased in OCON vs. MCON and accompanied by increased expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1. In contrast, LV IL-6 was lower in MFO vs. old rats, and LV H(2)O(2) was decreased in MFO and OFO relative to respective control groups. Protein expression and activity of LV catalase and SOD-1 expression were increased in OFO similarly to OCON, but LV SOD activity was also increased in OFO vs. mature rats.

{"title": "An endocrine hypothesis for the genesis of atrial fibrillation: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and glycogen accumulation in atrial tissues.", "abstract": "The underlying role of intracellular glycogen in atrial fibrillation is unknown. Experimental models developed in the goat have shown an increase of intracellular glycogen concentration in atrial myocytes resulting from prolonged pacing induced atrial fibrillation (AF). These observed glycogen molecules are as a result of structural remodeling and are known to replace the intracellular myofibrils causing myolysis in studies done in different animal models. The accumulation of glycogen is progressively and directly related to the duration of pacing-induced AF. Similar responses have been seen in clinically derived atrial tissues.\nWe intend to present an endocrine hypothesis supported by published evidence that stress acting through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) is a contributing metabolic factor responsible for the increase of glucose levels via the hormone cortisol. This excess glucose is then metabolized by the myocytes during each heart beat and stored as glycogen. A literature search was done, and published evidence supporting stress was shown to be the main factor for the formation of glucose leading to glycogen deposition to in the cardiac myocytes.\nStress on the HPA axis stimulates the adrenal glands to release the hormone cortisol in the blood stream; this in turn increases the cardiac tissue glycogen concentration. It is also known that during each beat, excess glucose is removed by the myocytes and stored as glycogen. As aforementioned, in the cardiac myocytes, dense glycogen content with/without loss of myofibrils has been detected in both human and animal models of AF.\nWe hypothesize that the increase of the intrinsic glycogen concentration and distribution is a result of a metabolic disruption caused by stress through the HPA Axis. For example, in atrial myocytes, the glycogen molecules impede the normal intercellular communications leading to areas of slow conduction favoring reentrant-based AF.", "journal": "North American journal of medical sciences", "date": "2014-12-24", "authors": ["Abraham AEmbi", "Benjamin JScherlag"], "doi": "10.4103/1947-2714.145478"}

Intravascular injections of tomato lectin led to labeling of vascular structures in a variety of tissues, including brain, kidney, liver, intestine, spleen, skin, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and experimental tumors. Analyses of fluorescence in serum indicated the lectin was cleared from circulating blood within 2 min. Capillary labeling was apparent in tissues collected from animals within 1 min of intravascular injections, remained robust for about 1 h, and then declined markedly until difficult to detect 12 h after injection. Light microscopic images suggest the lectin bound to the endothelial cells that form capillaries and endothelial cells that line some larger vessels. Electron microscopic studies confirmed the labeling of luminal surfaces of endothelial cells.

Consequently, future generations of sea turtles may be at risk from increasing nest temperatures due to climate change, but little is known about how embryos respond to heat stress. Heat shock genes are likely to be important in this process because they code for proteins that prevent cellular damage in response to environmental stressors. This study provides the first evidence of an expression response in the heat shock genes of embryos of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) exposed to realistic and near-lethal temperatures (34\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C) for 1 or 3 hours. We investigated changes in Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), Hsp70, and Hsp90 mRNA in heart (n=24) and brain tissue (n=29) in response to heat stress. Under the most extreme treatment (36\u00b0C, 3h), Hsp70 increased mRNA expression by a factor of 38.8 in heart tissue and 15.7 in brain tissue, while Hsp90 mRNA expression increased by a factor of 98.3 in heart tissue and 14.7 in brain tissue. Hence, both Hsp70 and Hsp90 are useful biomarkers for assessing heat stress in the late-stage embryos of sea turtles.

Exposure to heat stress at 42\u00b0C resulted in similar induction patterns of the heart damage-related enzyme aspartate aminotransferase in the supernatants of H9c2 cells and in the serum of rats. Histological analysis revealed that both H9c2 cells and heart tissues displayed cellular degeneration in response to different periods of heat stress. Hsp47 was constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm of H9c2 cells at all time points during heat stress, which was consistent with observations in heart fibers in vivo. Immunoblotting analysis revealed no significant difference between the expression of Hsp47 in H9c2 cells and heart tissue. However, the expression of hsp47 mRNA in response to heat stress was significantly increased in H9c2 cells at 60 min (P < 0.01) and 100 min (P < 0.01), which was comparable to that at 100 min (P < 0.01) in the rat heart.

Our laboratory constructs 3D tissues with an innovative and unique method for layering multiple cell sheets. Cell sheets maintain a high-efficiently regenerating function, because of the higher cell density and higher transplantation efficiency, compared to other cell-delivery methods. Cell sheets have already been applied in clinical applications for regenerative medicine in treating patients with various diseases. Therefore, in our search to develop a more efficient treatment with cell sheets, we are constructing 3D tissues by layering cell sheets. Native animal tissues and organs have an abundance of capillaries to supply oxygen and nutrients, and to remove waste molecules. In our investigation of vascularized cardiac cell sheets, we have found that endothelial cells within cell sheets spontaneously form blood vessel networks as in vivo capillaries. To construct even thicker 3D tissues by layering multiple cell sheets, it is critical to have a medium or blood flow within the vascular networks of the cell sheets. Therefore, to perfuse medium or blood in the cell sheet vascular network to maintain the viability of all cells, we developed two types of vascular beds; (1) a femoral muscle-based vascular bed, and (2) a synthetic collagen gel-based vascular bed. Both vascular beds successfully provide the critical flow of culture medium, which allows 12-layer cell sheets to survive. Such bioreactor systems, when combined with cell sheet engineering techniques, have produced functional vascularized 3D tissues.

{"title": "Vangl2-regulated polarisation of second heart field-derived cells is required for outflow tract lengthening during cardiac development.", "abstract": "Planar cell polarity (PCP) is the mechanism by which cells orient themselves in the plane of an epithelium or during directed cell migration, and is regulated by a highly conserved signalling pathway. Mutations in the PCP gene Vangl2, as well as in other key components of the pathway, cause a spectrum of cardiac outflow tract defects. However, it is unclear why cells within the mesodermal heart tissue require PCP signalling. Using a new conditionally floxed allele we show that Vangl2 is required solely within the second heart field (SHF) to direct normal outflow tract lengthening, a process that is required for septation and normal alignment of the aorta and pulmonary trunk with the ventricular chambers. Analysis of a range of markers of polarised epithelial tissues showed that in the normal heart, undifferentiated SHF cells move from the dorsal pericardial wall into the distal outflow tract where they acquire an epithelial phenotype, before moving proximally where they differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Thus there is a transition zone in the distal outflow tract where SHF cells become more polarised, turn off progenitor markers and start to differentiate to cardiomyocytes. Membrane-bound Vangl2 marks the proximal extent of this transition zone and in the absence of Vangl2, the SHF-derived cells are abnormally polarised and disorganised. The consequent thickening, rather than lengthening, of the outflow wall leads to a shortened outflow tract. Premature down regulation of the SHF-progenitor marker Isl1 in the mutants, and accompanied premature differentiation to cardiomyocytes, suggests that the organisation of the cells within the transition zone is important for maintaining the undifferentiated phenotype. Thus, Vangl2-regulated polarisation and subsequent acquisition of an epithelial phenotype is essential to lengthen the tubular outflow vessel, a process that is essential for on-going cardiac morphogenesis.", "journal": "PLoS genetics", "date": "2014-12-19", "authors": ["Simon ARamsbottom", "VipulSharma", "Hong JunRhee", "LorraineEley", "Helen MPhillips", "Hannah FRigby", "CharlotteDean", "BillChaudhry", "Deborah JHenderson"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1004871"}

Recent work documented that Adipo locally associates with responsive tissues through interactions with T-cadherin (Tcad), an atypical, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cadherin cell surface glycoprotein. Mice deficient for Tcad lack tissue-associated Adipo, accumulate Adipo in the circulation, and mimic the Adipo knockout (KO) cardiovascular phenotype. In reverse, Tcad protein is visibly reduced from cardiac tissue in Adipo-KO mice, suggesting interdependent regulation of the 2 proteins. Here, we evaluate the effect of Adipo on Tcad protein expression. Adipo and Tcad proteins were colocalized in aorta, heart, and skeletal muscle. Adipo positively regulated levels of Tcad protein in vivo and in endothelial cell (EC) cultures. In Tcad-KO mice, binding of endogenous and exogenously administered Adipo to cardiovascular tissues was dramatically reduced. Consistently, knockdown of Tcad in cultured murine vascular ECs significantly diminished Adipo binding. In search for a possible mechanism, we found that enzymatic cleavage of Tcad with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C increases plasma Adipo while decreasing tissue-bound levels. Similarly, pretreatment of cultured ECs with serum containing Adipo attenuated phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-mediated Tcad cleavage. In vivo administration of adenovirus producing Adipo suppressed plasma levels of GPI phospholipase D, the endogenous cleavage enzyme for GPI-anchored proteins. In conclusion, our data show that both circulating and tissue-bound Adipo levels are dependent on Tcad and, in reverse, regulate tissue Tcad levels through a positive feedback loop that operates by suppressing phospholipase-mediated Tcad release from the cell surface.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["KeisukeMatsuda", "YuyaFujishima", "NorikazuMaeda", "TakuyaMori", "AyumuHirata", "RyoheiSekimoto", "YuTsushima", "ShigekiMasuda", "MasayaYamaoka", "KanaInoue", "HitoshiNishizawa", "ShunbunKita", "BarbaraRanscht", "TohruFunahashi", "IichiroShimomura"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2014-1618"}

The goal of this study was to determine if enhanced skeletal muscle expression of EcSOD is sufficient to mitigate streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy.\nExercise training promotes EcSOD expression in skeletal muscle and provides protection against diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, it is not known if enhanced expression of EcSOD in skeletal muscle plays a functional role in this protection. Here, we show that skeletal muscle-specific EcSOD transgenic mice are protected from cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction under the condition of type 1 diabetes mellitus induced by streptozotocin injection. We also show that both exercise training and muscle-specific transgenic expression of EcSOD result in elevated EcSOD protein in the blood and heart without increased transcription in the heart, suggesting that enhanced expression of EcSOD from skeletal muscle redistributes to the heart. Importantly, cardiac tissue in transgenic mice displayed significantly reduced oxidative stress, aberrant cell signaling, and inflammatory cytokine expression compared with wild-type mice under the same diabetic condition.\nEnhanced expression of EcSOD in skeletal muscle is sufficient to mitigate streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy through attenuation of oxidative stress, aberrant cell signaling, and inflammation, suggesting a cross-organ mechanism by which exercise training improves cardiac function in diabetes mellitus.", "journal": "Circulation.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contributes to cardiovascular alterations and mediates part of the MR effects. Recently, we showed that EGFR is required for physiological homeostasis and function of heart and arteries in adult animals. We hypothesize that moderate high aldosterone/NaCl, at normal blood pressure, affects the cardiovascular system depending on cardiovascular EGFR. Therefore we performed an experimental series in male and female animals each, using a recently established mouse model with EGFR knockout in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes and determined the effects of a mild-high aldosterone-to-NaCl constellation on a.o. marker gene expression, heart size, systolic blood pressure, impulse conduction and heart rate. Our data show that (i) cardiac tissue of male but not of female mice is sensitive to mild aldosterone/NaCl treatment, (ii) EGFR knockout induces stronger cardiac disturbances in male as compared to female animals and (iii) mild aldosterone/NaCl treatment requires the EGFR in order to disturb cardiac tissue homeostasis whereas beneficial effects of aldosterone seem to be independent of EGFR.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["BarbaraSchreier", "SindyRabe", "SabrinaWinter", "StefanieRuhs", "SigridMildenberger", "BettinaSchneider", "MariaSibilia", "MichaelGotthardt", "SabineKempe", "KarstenM\u00e4der", "ClaudiaGrossmann", "MichaelGekle"], "doi": "10.1038/srep07430"}

At the end of this period, the parasite distribution in heart, brain and two skeletal muscles in sheep was compared with this in pigs. Whereas the parasite distribution was similar in sheep and pigs, the antibody response differed considerably. In sheep, antibodies appeared against all tested T. gondii antigens, but mainly against rGRA7, rMIC3234307 and TLA whereas in pigs only rGRA7-specific antibodies could be demonstrated. Also, the cytokine response differed. Both in sheep and pigs an IFN-gamma response occurred which seemed to be a slightly more pronounced in sheep. In sheep, also IL-10 and IL-4 mRNA expression showed an increase, but later than IFN-gamma and with more variation. However, in pigs no such increase was seen.

We have previously reported a novel mouse model of near-fatal hazelnut (HN) allergy that involves transdermal sensitization followed by oral elicitation of allergic reactions. Here we studied the cardiac mast cell and cardiac tissue responses during oral nut induced allergic reaction in this mouse model.\nGroups of mice were sensitized with HN and specific and total IgE were measured by ELISA. Oral allergic reaction was quantified by rectal thermometry and plasma mouse mast cell protease (mMCP)-1 by ELISA. Cardiovascular functions were determined by a non-invasive tail cuff method. Mucosal mast cells (MMC) and intestinal connective tissue MC (CTMC) were studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mMCP-1 and mMCP-4 protein expression respectively. Cardiac MC were studied by toluidine blue (TB) as well as by the above IHC methods. Cytokines and chemokines in the tissues were quantified by a multiplex protein array method.\nOral allergen challenge (OAC) of transdermal sensitized mice results in hypothermia, hypotension, tachycardia and rapid elevation of circulating mMCP-1. The IHC analysis of small intestine found significant expansion of mMCP-1+ MMCs and mMCP-4+ CTMCs. The TB analysis of cardiac tissues showed degranulation of majority of cardiac MCs. The IHC analysis of cardiac tissues showed very little mMCP-1 expression, but marked mMCP-4 expression. Furthermore, repeated OAC resulted in significant expansion of mMCP-4+ cardiac MCs in both the pericardium and the myocardium. Protein array analysis revealed significant elevation of cardiac IL-6 and CCR1/3 and CXCR2 signaling chemokines upon oral elicitation compared to sensitization alone.\nThese results demonstrate that: (i) besides the intestine, cardiac mast cells and the cardiac tissue respond during oral nut induced allergic reaction; and (ii) repeated oral elicitation of reaction is associated with cardiac mMCP-4+ mast cell expansion and elevation of cardiac IL-6, and CCR1/3 and CXCR2 signaling chemokines.", "journal": "Immunobiology", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["BabuGonipeta", "RadhakrishnaPara", "YingliHe", "InesSrkalovic", "TinaOrtiz", "EunjungKim", "SitaramParvataneni", "VenuGangur"], "doi": "10.1016/j.imbio.2014.11.012"}

Resveratrol also plays an important role in cancer prevention and decreases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In our research, we proposed the development of the therapeutic product from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes that would exhibit the beneficial properties of polyphenols. Standard operating procedures were developed in our laboratories to collect alcohol free concentrate of polyphenols from the Kazakhstan Cabernet Sauvignon collection of grapes. The purpose of the study was to investigate the composition, biological safety, and potential therapeutic effects of the polyphenol concentrate.\nThe total polyphenol amount was determined using the Enology Analyzer Y15 (BioSystems, Spain). HPLC analysis of the polyphenol composition was performed using Agilent 1290 chromatograph. The polyphenol concentrate was analyzed for the microbiological purity and the presence of the toxic elements. The cytoprotective effect of the polyphenol concentrate was studied in experimental models of diabetes, toxic hepatitis, doxorubicin cardiomyopathy, and acute radiation sickness.\nThe total polyphenol amount in one sample was 12,819 mg/l.

It was shown then that PLGA:CNF composites were conductive and that conductivity increased as greater amounts of CNFs were added to pure PLGA. Moreover, tensile tests showed that addition of CNFs increased the tensile strength of the PLGA composite to mimic that of natural heart tissue. Most importantly, throughout all cytocompatibility experiments, cardiomyocytes were viable and expressed important biomarkers that were greatest on 50:50 wt% CNF:PLGA composites. The increased selective adsorption of fibronectin and vitronectin (critical proteins that mediate cardiomyocyte function) onto such composites proved to be the mechanism of action. However, the natural myocardium is anisotropic in terms of mechanical and electrical properties, which was not emulated in these prior PLGA:CNF composites. Thus, the aim of this in vitro study was to create and characterize CNFs aligned in PLGA composites (at 50:50 wt%, including their mechanical and electrical properties and cardiomyocyte density), comparing such results with randomly oriented CNFs in PLGA. Specifically, CNFs were added to soluble biodegradable PLGA (50:50 PGA:PLA weight ratio) and aligned by applying a voltage and then allowing the polymer to cure. CNF surface micron patterns (20 \u03bcm wide) on PLGA were then fabricated through a mold method to further mimic myocardium anisotropy. The results demonstrated anisotropic mechanical and electrical properties and significantly improved cardiomyocyte density for up to 5 days on CNFs aligned in PLGA compared with being randomly oriented in PLGA.

{"title": "Uric acid promotes left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in mice fed a Western diet.", "abstract": "The rising obesity rates parallel increased consumption of a Western diet, high in fat and fructose, which is associated with increased uric acid. Population-based data support that elevated serum uric acids are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which excess uric acid promotes these maladaptive cardiac effects has not been explored. In assessing the role of Western diet-induced increases in uric acid, we hypothesized that reductions in uric acid would prevent Western diet-induced development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac stiffness, and impaired diastolic relaxation by reducing growth and profibrotic signaling pathways. Four-weeks-old C57BL6/J male mice were fed excess fat (46%) and fructose (17.5%) with or without allopurinol (125 mg/L), a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, for 16 weeks. The Western diet-induced increases in serum uric acid along with increases in cardiac tissue xanthine oxidase activity temporally related to increases in body weight, fat mass, and insulin resistance without changes in blood pressure. The Western diet induced cardiomyocte hypertrophy, myocardial oxidative stress, interstitial fibrosis, and impaired diastolic relaxation. Further, the Western diet enhanced activation of the S6 kinase-1 growth pathway and the profibrotic transforming growth factor-\u03b21/Smad2/3 signaling pathway and macrophage proinflammatory polarization. All results improved with allopurinol treatment, which lowered cardiac xanthine oxidase as well as serum uric acid levels.

The mechanism by which loss of GAA activity causes cardiomyopathy is poorly understood. We reprogrammed fibroblasts from patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that were differentiated to cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM). Pompe iPSC-CMs had undetectable GAA activity and pathognomonic glycogen-filled lysosomes. Nonetheless, Pompe and control iPSC-CMs exhibited comparable contractile properties in engineered cardiac tissue. Impaired autophagy has been implicated in Pompe skeletal muscle; however, control and Pompe iPSC-CMs had comparable clearance rates of LC3-II-detected autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, the lysosome-associated membrane proteins, LAMP1 and LAMP2, from Pompe iPSC-CMs demonstrated higher electrophoretic mobility compared with control iPSC-CMs. Brefeldin A induced disruption of the Golgi in control iPSC-CMs reproduced the higher mobility forms of the LAMPs, suggesting that Pompe iPSC-CMs produce LAMPs lacking appropriate glycosylation. Isoelectric focusing studies revealed that LAMP2 has a more alkaline pI in Pompe compared with control iPSC-CMs due largely to hyposialylation. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of N-linked glycans demonstrated reduced diversity of multiantennary structures and the major presence of a trimannose complex glycan precursor in Pompe iPSC-CMs. These data suggest that Pompe cardiomyopathy has a glycan processing abnormality and thus shares features with hypertrophic cardiomyopathies observed in the congenital disorders of glycosylation.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2014-12-10", "authors": ["Kunil KRaval", "RanTao", "Brent EWhite", "Willem JDe Lange", "Chad HKoonce", "JunyingYu", "Priya SKishnani", "James AThomson", "Deane FMosher", "John CRalphe", "Timothy JKamp"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M114.628628"}

Attention has recently focused on the link between environmental pollution and cardiovascular diseases. Nanoparticles <50 nm in size are known to pass the alveolar-pulmonary barrier, enter into bloodstream and induce inflammation, but the direct pathogenic mechanisms still need to be evaluated. We thus focused our attention on titanium dioxide (TiO\u2082) nanoparticles, the most diffuse nanomaterial in polluted environments and one generally considered inert for the human body.\nWe conducted functional studies on isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes exposed acutely in vitro to TiO\u2082 and on healthy rats administered a single dose of 2 mg/Kg TiO\u2082 NPs via the trachea. Transmission electron microscopy was used to verify the actual presence of TiO\u2082 nanoparticles within cardiac tissue, toxicological assays were used to assess lipid peroxidation and DNA tissue damage, and an in silico method was used to model the effect on action potential.\nVentricular myocytes exposed in vitro to TiO\u2082 had significantly reduced action potential duration, impairment of sarcomere shortening and decreased stability of resting membrane potential. In vivo, a single intra-tracheal administration of saline solution containing TiO\u2082 nanoparticles increased cardiac conduction velocity and tissue excitability, resulting in an enhanced propensity for inducible arrhythmias.

{"title": "Robust image-based estimation of cardiac tissue parameters and their uncertainty from noisy data.", "abstract": "Clinical applications of computational cardiac models require precise personalization, i.e. fitting model parameters to capture patient's physiology. However, due to parameter non-identifiability, limited data, uncertainty in the clinical measurements, and modeling assumptions, various combinations of parameter values may exist that yield the same quality of fit. Hence, there is a need for quantifying the uncertainty in estimated parameters and to ascertain the uniqueness of the found solution. This paper presents a stochastic method to estimate the parameters of an image-based electromechanical model of the heart and their uncertainty due to noise in measurements. First, Bayesian inference is applied to fully estimate the posterior probability density function (PDF) of the model. To that end, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is used, which is made computationally tractable by employing a fast surrogate model based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion, instead of the true forward model. Then, we use the mean-shift algorithm to automatically find the modes of the PDF and select the most likely one while being robust to noise. The approach is used to estimate global active stress and passive stiffness from invasive pressure and image-based volume quantification. Experiments on eight patients showed that not only our approach yielded goodness of fits equivalent to a well-established deterministic method, but we could also demonstrate the non-uniqueness of the problem and report uncertainty estimates, crucial information for subsequent clinical assessments of the personalized models.", "journal": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Our previous study demonstrated that combined electromechanical stimulation that simulated the timing of isovolumic contraction in healthy tissue improved force generation via increased contractile and calcium handling protein expression and improved hypertrophic pathway activation. In new data presented here, we further demonstrate that modification of the timing between electrical and mechanical stimulation to mimic a non-physiological process negatively impacts the functionality of the engineered constructs.

The aim of the study was to determine the expression pattern of sarcomeric contractile protein \u03b1-actin, specialized cytoskeletal protein \u03b1-actinin and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) in myocardial remodeling induced by chronic exposure to CT-1. Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with carboxy-terminal polypeptide (CP) of CT-1 (CT-1-CP, 500 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7 day(-1)) for 1, 2, 3 and 4 week (s), respectively (4 groups obtained according to the injection time, n=10 each, with 5 males and 5 females in each group). Those injected with physiological saline for 4 weeks served as controls (n=10, with 5 males and 5 females). The heart tissues of mice were harvested at 1, 2, 3 or 4 week (s). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB) were used to detect the distribution and expression of sarcomeric \u03b1-actin, \u03b1-actinin and mitochondrial UCP2 in myocardial tissues. IHC showed that \u03b1-actin was mainly distributed around the nuclei of cardiomyocytes, \u03b1-actinin concentrated around the striae and UCP2 scattered rather evenly in the plasma. The expression of \u03b1-actin was slightly greater than that of \u03b1-actinin and UCP2 in the control group (IHC: \u03c7(2)=6.125; WB: F=0.249, P>0.05) and it gradually decreased after exposure to CT-1-CP. There was no significant difference in the expression of \u03b1-actin between the control group and the CT-1-CP-treated groups (\u03c7 (2)=7.386, P>0.05). But Western blotting revealed significant difference in the expression of \u03b1-actin between the control group and the 4-week CT-1-CP-treated group (F=2.912; q=4.203, P<0.05). Moreover, it was found that the expression of \u03b1-actinin increased stepwise with the exposure time in CT-1-CP-treated groups and differed significantly between CT-1-CP-treated groups and the control group (ICH: \u03c7 (2)=21.977; WB: F=50.388; P<0.01). The expression of UCP2 was initially increased (WB: control group vs. 1- or 2-week group, q values: 5.603 and 9.995, respectively, P<0.01) and then decreased (WB: control group vs. 3-week group, q=4.742, P<0.01; control group vs. 4-week group, q=0.558, P>0.05). It was suggested that long-term exposure to CT-1-CP could lead to the alteration in the expression of sarcomeric \u03b1-actin, \u03b1-actinin and mitochondrial UCP2. The different expressions of sarcomeric structure proteins and mitochondrial UCP2 may be involved in myocardial remodeling.", "journal": "Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

{"title": "Cooperative stabilization of transthyretin by clusterin and diflunisal.", "abstract": "The circulating protein transthyretin (TTR) can unfold, oligomerize, and form highly structured amyloid fibrils that are deposited in tissues, causing organ damage and disease. This pathogenic process is caused by a heritable TTR point mutation in cases of familial TTR-related amyloidosis or wild-type TTR in cases of age-associated amyloidosis (previously called senile systemic amyloidosis). The TTR amyloid cascade is hypothesized to begin with the dissociation of the TTR native tetrameric structure into folded but unstable monomeric TTR subunits. Unfolding of monomeric TTR initiates an oligomerization process leading to aggregation and fibril formation. Numerous proteostatic mechanisms for regulating the TTR amyloid cascade exist. Extracellular chaperones provide an innate defense against misfolded proteins. Clusterin (CLU), a plasma protein, has the capacity to recognize exposed hydrophobic regions of misfolded proteins, shielding them from aggregation. We have previously demonstrated that CLU is associated with the amyloid fibrils in cardiac tissues from patients with TTR amyloidosis. In this study, we have used tetrameric and monomeric TTR structural variants to determine the ability of CLU to inhibit TTR amyloid fibril formation. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we determined that CLU preferentially stabilizes monomeric TTR and generates increasingly stable conformations under acid stress. Moreover, studies using surface plasmon resonance showed a direct interaction of CLU with high-molecular weight TTR oligomers. The interactions of CLU with monomeric and aggregated TTR proceed in a cooperative manner in the presence of diflunisal, a small molecule drug used to stabilize TTR tetramers.", "journal": "Biochemistry", "date": "2014-12-06", "authors": ["Michael JGreene", "Elena SKlimtchuk", "David CSeldin", "John LBerk", "Lawreen HConnors"], "doi": "10.1021/bi5011249"}

Autophagy, a protein degradation pathway, has recently been shown to be involved in the regulation of cardiac dysfunction and atrophy. In this study, we investigated the relationships between dysfunction and inactivity-induced atrophy and autophagy in rat cardiac tissue.\nPhysical inactivity was simulated by a tail suspension model, and cardiac function was examined by echocardiography. Cardiac atrophy was measured by wheat germ agglutinin staining and autophagic activity was detected by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining.\nWe demonstrated that cardiac function, especially contractility, declined and the area of cardiac atrophy increased in the tail-suspended cardiac tissue. Additionally, the cross-sectional area of myocardial cells decreased; however, apoptosis did not increase with tail suspension. Similarly, the expression of autophagy-related proteins and the number of autophagosomes were elevated in the tail-suspended cardiac tissue. Moreover, the administration of chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed cardiac dysfunction and atrophy via the suppression of autophagic activity during suspension. Our results indicate that autophagy facilitates the development and progression of cardiac dysfunction and atrophy induced by tail suspension.\nOur studies hint that the components of the autophagy-related signaling pathway are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiac diseases induced by physical inactivity.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2014-12-06", "authors": ["HongLiu", "QiongXie", "Bing-MuXin", "Jun-LianLiu", "YuLiu", "Yong-ZhiLi", "Jia-PingWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2014.10.023"}

Acellular samples prepared by high-hydrostatic pressure (HHP) protocols with different washing media were implanted and the calcification was monitored under micro-computed tomography for 1 and 3\u00a0months. The amount of the calcium deposition was quantitatively evaluated by atomic absorption spectroscopy. A cell culture medium showed very good cell removal ability but led to severe calcification at 1\u00a0month, and surprisingly the calcium deposition increased as the washing period increased. This calcification was suppressed by removing the DNA fraction with high DNase concentration. On the other hand, the calcification was greatly reduced when washed with saline even at low DNase concentration after 2\u00a0weeks washing. These results suggest that the ion species in the washing medium and the residual DNase cooperatively affect the tendency of in vivo calcification, which led us to the possibility of reduced calcification of acellular cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs", "date": "2014-12-05", "authors": ["AtsushiMahara", "MitsuruSago", "HarukaYamaguchi", "TomoEhashi", "KenjiMinatoya", "HiroshiTanaka", "TakeshiNakatani", "ToshiyukiMoritan", "ToshiyaFujisato", "TetsujiYamaoka"], "doi": "10.1007/s10047-014-0808-7"}

Here, we perform a global, multiorgan characterization of the gene response to heat stress using an in vivo conscious rat model.\nWe heated rats until implanted thermal probes indicated a maximal core temperature of 41.8\u00b0C (Tc,Max). We then compared transcriptomic profiles of liver, lung, kidney, and heart tissues harvested from groups of experimental animals at Tc,Max, 24 hours, and 48 hours after heat stress to time-matched controls kept at an ambient temperature. Cardiac histopathology at 48 hours supported persistent cardiac injury in three out of six animals. Microarray analysis identified 78 differentially expressed genes common to all four organs at Tc,Max. Self-organizing maps identified gene-specific signatures corresponding to protein-folding disorders in heat-stressed rats with histopathological evidence of cardiac injury at 48 hours. Quantitative proteomics analysis by iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) demonstrated that differential protein expression most closely matched the transcriptomic profile in heat-injured animals at 48 hours. Calculation of protein supersaturation scores supported an increased propensity of proteins to aggregate for proteins that were found to be changing in abundance at 24 hours and in animals with cardiac injury at 48 hours, suggesting a mechanistic association between protein misfolding and the heat-stress response.\nPathway analyses at both the transcript and protein levels supported catastrophic deficits in energetics and cellular metabolism and activation of the unfolded protein response in heat-stressed rats with histopathological evidence of persistent heat injury, providing the basis for a systems-level physiological model of heat illness and recovery.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2014-12-05", "authors": ["Jonathan DStallings", "Danielle LIppolito", "VineetRakesh", "Christine EBaer", "William EDennis", "Bryan GHelwig", "David AJackson", "Lisa RLeon", "John ALewis", "JaquesReifman"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-15-1058\n10.1056/NEJMra011089\n10.1111/j.1600-0838.2011.01333.x\n10.1096/fj.01-0944rev\n10.1038/nm.2598\n10.2741/S111\n10.1093/bja/88.5.700\n10.1146/annurev.ge.27.120193.002253\n10.1098/rstb.1993.0026\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00589.2013\n10.2741/S118\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072258\n10.1186/1471-2164-10-519\n10.1186/gb-2003-4-5-p3\n10.1134/S0026893310050110\n10.1016/S0092-8674(05)80069-8\n10.1379/1466-1268(2002)007<0065:DAOUSA>2.0.CO;2\n10.1515/bmc-2012-0001\n10.1074/jbc.M212761200\n10.1007/s11064-006-9271-z\n10.1074/mcp.M900261-MCP200\n10.1016/j.jmb.2009.03.033\n10.1016/j.biocel.2008.08.038\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.025\n10.1186/1476-4598-11-20\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.11.010\n10.1038/ng1617\n10.1093/nar/gkp854\n10.1074/jbc.274.6.3549\n10.1074/jbc.M607510200\n10.4049/jimmunol.1103506\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0040423\n10.1093/hmg/ddm002\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4402200\n10.1074/jbc.M509409200\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401984\n10.1128/MCB.01453-06\n10.1074/jbc.M607007200\n10.1002/bit.23282\n10.1101/sqb.2012.76.010637\n10.1038/nsmb0111-1\n10.1016/j.coph.2009.07.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.161273\n10.1007/s12192-008-0068-7\n10.1080/10253890400019706\n10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00191-6\n10.1093/emboj/20.3.446\n10.1023/B:MCBI.0000044312.59958.c8\n10.4161/cc.5.22.3448\n10.2174/092986707782360079\n10.1007/s12192-010-0172-3\n10.1172/JCI26471\n10.1189/jlb.0905523\n10.1016/S0002-9343(01)00974-3\n10.1152/ajpcell.00032.2008\n10.1007/s12192-012-0356-0\n10.1007/s00109-009-0520-x\n10.1074/jbc.M509278200\n10.1038/nature04768\n10.1128/MCB.24.13.5721-5732.2004\n10.1016/S0079-6123(06)62018-9\n10.1016/S0079-6123(06)62021-9\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.301882\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067923\n10.1126/science.1141448\n10.1038/nature02261\n10.1056/NEJMra0909142\n10.1101/cshperspect.a004457\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.09.043\n10.1097/01.fjc.0000166234.11336.a9\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.08.015\n10.1042/BJ20051568\n10.1023/A:1018943613122\n10.1186/1471-2105-11-211\n10.1073/pnas.0914005107\n10.1002/sim.4780090710\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btf877\n10.1016/1044-0305(94)80016-2\n10.1021/ac0341261\n10.1186/1471-2164-6-145\n10.1074/mcp.M113.028621\n10.1074/mcp.M500230-MCP200"}

Although ~500 beating ACMs are observed under microscope in the cell cultures obtained from the hearts of either male or female mice, the origin of these cells in cardiac tissue has yet to be elucidated due to the lack of exclusive markers. In the present study, we demonstrate the efficacy of cellular prion protein (PrP) as a surface marker of ACMs. Cells expressing PrP at the plasma membrane in the culture of the crude fraction cells were found to develop into beating ACMs by themselves or fuse with each other to become larger multinuclear beating ACMs. Combining PrP with a cardiac-specific contractile protein cardiac troponin T (cTnT) allowed us to identify native ACMs in the mouse cardiac ventricles as either clustered or solitary cells. PrP- and cTnT-marked cells were also found in the adult, even aged, human cardiac ventricles.

As both the stiffness and composition of the ECM are important in regulating cell behavior and can have complex synergistic effects, we sought to develop an ECM-based scaffold with tunable biochemical and mechanical properties. We used solubilized rat cardiac ECM from two developmental stages (neonatal, adult) combined with fibrin hydrogels that were cross-linked with transglutaminase. We show that ECM was retained within the gels and that the Young's modulus could be tuned to span the range of the developing and mature heart. C-kit+ cardiovascular progenitor cells from pediatric patients with congenital heart defects were seeded into the hybrid gels. Both the elastic modulus and composition of the scaffolds impacted the expression of endothelial and smooth muscle cell genes.

Radiofrequency (RF) ablation alters the biomechanical properties of cardiac tissue, ultimately allowing for perforation to occur more readily. Studies on the effects of cryoablation on perforation force as well as studies defining the perforation force of human tissue are limited.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the required force to elicit perforation of cardiac atrial tissue after or during ablation procedures.\nEffects of RF or cryothermal ablations on catheter perforation forces for both swine (n = 83 animals, 530 treatments) and human (n = 8 specimens, 136 treatments) cardiac tissue were investigated.\nOverall average forces resulting in perforation of healthy unablated tissue were 406g \u00b1 170g for swine and 591g \u00b1 240g for humans. Post-RF ablation applications considerably reduced these forces to 246g \u00b1 118g for swine and 362 \u00b1 185g for humans (P <.001). Treatments with cryoablation did not significantly alter forces required to induce perforations. Decreasing catheter sizes resulted in a reduction in forces required to perforate the atrial wall (P <.001). Catheter perforations occurred over an array of contact forces with a minimum of 38g being observed.\nThe swine model likely underestimates the required perforation forces relative to those of human tissues. We provide novel insights related to the comparative effects of RF and cryothermal ablations on the potential for inducing undesired punctures, with RF ablation reducing perforation force significantly.

However, the expression of different drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) in RL-14 cells has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, the main objectives of the current work were to investigate the capacity of RL-14 cells to express different cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and correlate this expression to primary cardiomyocytes.\nThe expression of CYP isoenzymes was determined at mRNA, protein and catalytic activity levels using real time-PCR, Western blot analysis and liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), respectively.\nOur results showed that RL-14 cells constitutively express CYP \u03c9-hydroxylases, CYP1A, 1B, 4A and 4F; CYP epoxygenases, CYP2B, 2C and 2J; in addition to soluble epoxide hydrolayse (EPHX2) at mRNA and protein levels. The basal expression of CYP \u03c9-hydroxylases, epoxygenases and EPHX2 was supported by the ability of RL-14 cells to convert arachidonic acid to its biologically active metabolites, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (20-HETEs), 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (14,15-EET), 11,12-EET, 8,9-EET, 5,6-EET, 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DHET), 11,12-DHET, 8,9-DHET and 5,6-DHET.

Mutations in KCNH2 or pharmacological agents that reduce IKr slow action potential (AP) repolarization and can trigger cardiac arrhythmias associated with long QT syndrome. Two channel-forming subunits encoded by KCNH2 (hERG 1a and 1b) are expressed in cardiac tissue. In heterologous expression systems, these subunits avidly coassemble and exhibit biophysical and pharmacological properties distinct from those of homomeric hERG 1a channels. Despite these findings, adoption of hERG 1a/1b heteromeric channels as a model for cardiac IKr has been hampered by the lack of evidence for a direct functional role for the 1b subunit in native tissue. In this study, we measured IKr and APs at physiological temperature in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs). We found that specific knockdown of the 1b subunit using shRNA caused reductions in 1b mRNA, 1b protein levels, and IKr magnitude by roughly one-half. AP duration was increased and AP variability was enhanced relative to controls. Early afterdepolarizations, considered cellular substrates for arrhythmia, were also observed in cells with reduced 1b expression. Similar behavior was elicited when channels were effectively converted from heteromers to 1a homomers by expressing a fragment corresponding to the 1a-specific N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim domain, which is omitted from hERG 1b by alternate transcription.

We studied the relative contributions of experimentally recorded intrinsic and extrinsic variability to dispersion of repolarization in tissue. We developed four cell-specific parameterizations of a phenomenological stochastic differential equation AP model exhibiting intrinsic variability using APs recorded from isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes exhibiting BVR. We performed simulations in tissue using the four different model parameterizations in the presence and the absence of both intrinsic and extrinsic variability. We altered the coupling of the tissue to determine how inter-cellular coupling affected the dispersion of the AP duration in tissue.

In a closed chest model of myocardial ischemia, coronary occlusion was induced by balloon angioplasty (n=9). (99m)Tc-duramycin (10-15mCi) was injected intravenously at 1hour after reperfusion. SPECT/CT was acquired at 1 and 3hours after injection. Cardiac tissues were analyzed for changes associated with acute cellular injuries. Autoradiography and gamma counting were used to determine radioactivity uptake. For the remaining animals, (99m)Tc-tetrafosamin scan was performed on the second day to identify the infarct site.\nIntravenously injected (99m)Tc-duramycin cleared from circulation predominantly via the renal/urinary tract with an \u03b1-phase half-life of 3.6\u00b10.3minutes and \u03b2-phase half-life of 179.9\u00b164.7minutes.

{"title": "Attenuation of ER stress prevents post-infarction-induced cardiac rupture and remodeling by modulating both cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis.", "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases, but the role of ER stress in cardiac rupture and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is still unclear. Here we investigated whether ER stress plays a major role for these processes in mice. We ligated the left coronary artery (LCA) without reperfusion in mice and administered either NaCl or 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, 20 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally for 4 weeks. Cardiac rupture rates during the first week of MI were 37.5% and 18.2% in the control and 4-PBA groups, respectively. The extent of ventricular aneurysm and fibrosis was less, and the cardiac function better, in the 4-PBA group compared with the control group. The protein levels of ER stress markers in the heart tissues of the control group remained elevated during the entire 4-week period after MI, while pro-apoptotic proteins mainly increased in the early phase, and the pro-fibrotic proteins markedly increased in the late phase post MI; 4-PBA decreased all of these protein levels. In the primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts, hypoxia (3% O2) increased the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes and promoted the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, all of which were attenuated by 4-PBA (0.5 mM). These findings indicate that MI induces ER stress and provokes cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis, culminating in cardiac rupture and remodeling, and that the attenuation of ER stress could be an effective therapeutic target to prevent post-MI complications.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["TaoLuo", "Jin KyungKim", "BaiheChen", "AhmedAbdel-Latif", "MasafumiKitakaze", "LiangYan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2014.10.032"}

Shortage of organ donors and complications arising after orthotopic transplant remain major challenges to the modern field of heart transplantation. Engineering functional myocardium de novo requires an abundant source of cardiomyocytes, a biocompatible scaffold material and a functional vasculature to sustain the high metabolism of the construct. Progress has been made on several fronts, with cardiac cell biology, stem cells and biomaterials research particularly promising for cardiac tissue engineering, however currently employed strategies for vascularisation have lagged behind and limit the volume of tissue formed. Over ten years we have developed an in vivo tissue engineering model to construct vascularised tissue from various cell and tissue sources, including cardiac tissue. In this article we review the progress made with this approach and others, together with their potential to support a volume of engineered tissue for cardiac tissue engineering where contractile mass impacts directly on functional outcomes in translation to the clinic. It is clear that a scaled-up cardiac tissue engineering solution required for clinical treatment of heart failure will include a robust vascular supply for successful translation.

As a result, the role of tissue engineering in cardiac regenerative medicine has become multifaceted as new applications become feasible. Cardiac tissue engineering has long been established to have the potential to partially or fully restore cardiac function after cardiac injury. However, EHTs may also serve as surrogate human cardiac tissue for drug-related toxicity screening. Cardiotoxicity remains a major cause of drug withdrawal in the pharmaceutical industry. Unsafe drugs reach the market because preclinical evaluation is insufficient to weed out cardiotoxic drugs in all their forms. Bioengineering methods could provide functional and mature human myocardial tissues, ie, physiologically relevant platforms, for screening the cardiotoxic effects of pharmaceutical agents and facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic agents.

{"title": "The role of short term memory and conduction velocity restitution in alternans formation.", "abstract": "Alternans is the periodic beat-to-beat short-long alternation in action potential duration (APD), which is considered to be a precursor of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In extended cardiac tissue, electrical alternans can be either spatially concordant (SCA, all cells oscillate in phase) or spatially discordant (SDA, cells in different regions oscillate out of phase). SDA gives rise to an increase in the spatial dispersion of repolarization, which is thought to be proarrhythmic. In this paper, we investigated the effect of two aspects of short term memory (STM) (\u03b1, \u03c4) and their interplay with conduction velocity (CV) restitution on alternans formation using numerical simulations of a mapping model with two beats of memory. Here, \u03b1 quantifies the dependence of APD restitution on pacing history and \u03c4 characterizes APD accommodation, which is an exponential change of APD over time once basic cycle length (BCL) changes. Our main findings are as follows: In both single cell and spatially coupled homogeneous cable, the interplay between \u03b1 and \u03c4 affects the dynamical behaviors of the system. For the case of large APD accommodation (\u03c4 \u2265 290 ms), increase in \u03b1 leads to suppression of alternans. However, if APD accommodation is small (\u03c4 \u2264 250 ms), increase in \u03b1 leads to appearance of additional alternans region. On the other hand, the slope of CV restitution does not change the regions of alternans in the cable. However, steep CV restitution leads to more complicated dynamical behaviors of the system. Specifically, SDA instead of SCA are observed. In addition, for steep CV restitution and sufficiently large \u03c4, we observed formations of type II conduction block (CB2), transition from type I conduction block (CB1) to CB2, and unstable nodes.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2014-12-02", "authors": ["NingWei", "YoichiroMori", "Elena GTolkacheva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.014"}
{"title": "Targeted deletion of Tsc1 causes fatal cardiomyocyte hyperplasia independently of afterload.", "abstract": "Despite high expression levels, the role of Tsc1 in cardiovascular tissue is ill defined. We launched this study to examine the role of Tsc1 in cardiac physiology and pathology. Mice in which Tsc1 was deleted in cardiac tissue and vascular smooth muscle (Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-)), developed progressive cardiomegaly and hypertension and died early. Hearts of Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) mice displayed a progressive increase in cardiomyocyte number, and to a lesser extent, size between the ages of 1 and 6 weeks. In addition, compared to control hearts, proliferation markers (phospho-histone 3 and PCNA) were elevated in Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) cardiomyocytes at 0-4 weeks, suggesting that cardiomyocyte proliferation was the predominant mechanism underlying cardiomegaly in Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) mice. To examine the contribution of Tsc1 deletion in peripheral vascular smooth muscle to the cardiac phenotype, Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) mice were treated with the antihypertensive, hydralazine. Prevention of hypertension had no effect on survival, cardiac size, or cardiomyocyte number in these mice. We furthermore generated mice in which Tsc1 was deleted only in vascular smooth muscle but not in cardiac tissue (Tsc1c/cSMAcre-ER(T2+/-)). The Tsc1c/cSMAcre-ER(T2+/-) mice also developed hypertension. However, their survival was normal and no cardiac abnormalities were observed. Our results suggest that loss of Tsc1 in the heart causes cardiomegaly, which is driven by increased cardiomyocyte proliferation that also appears to confer relative resistance to afterload reduction.

{"title": "Exploring susceptibility to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias resulting from remodeling of the passive electrical properties in the heart: a simulation approach.", "abstract": "Under diseased conditions, remodeling of the cardiac tissue properties (\"passive properties\") takes place; these are aspects of electrophysiological behavior that are not associated with active ion transport across cell membranes. Remodeling of the passive electrophysiological properties most often results from structural remodeling, such as gap junction down-regulation and lateralization, fibrotic growth infiltrating the myocardium, or the development of an infarct scar. Such structural remodeling renders atrial or ventricular tissue as a major substrate for arrhythmias. The current review focuses on these aspects of cardiac arrhythmogenesis. Due to the inherent complexity of cardiac arrhythmias, computer simulations have provided means to elucidate interactions pertinent to this spatial scale. Here we review the current state-of-the-art in modeling atrial and ventricular arrhythmogenesis as arising from the disease-induced changes in the passive tissue properties, as well as the contributions these modeling studies have made to our understanding of the mechanisms of arrhythmias in the heart. Because of the rapid advance of structural imaging methodologies in cardiac electrophysiology, we chose to present studies that have used such imaging methodologies to construct geometrically realistic models of cardiac tissue, or the organ itself, where the regional remodeling properties of the myocardium can be represented in a realistic way.

{"title": "A proteomic study of Shengmai injection's mechanism on preventing cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury via energy metabolism modulation.", "abstract": "Energy metabolism modulation plays an important role in protecting the heart from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Shengmai injection (SMI) is a Chinese medicine, which is widely used in China to treat ischemic heart diseases with speculated functions of modulating energy metabolism. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective activity of SMI via the modulation of energy metabolism, a proteomic analysis was performed on ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injured hearts of rats in this study. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to measure the protein expression profiles of heart tissues. Differentially expressed proteins among groups were identified using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS). Western blot analysis was used to validate differentially expressed proteins. Proteomic data revealed 14 major differentially expressed proteins that are related to the energy metabolism. It was found that the glucose oxidation, TCA cycle and ATP synthesis related proteins were consistently up-regulated in SMI treated rats, which is beneficial to aerobic respiration and ATP generation. In contrast, two proteins catalyzing fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation were down-regulated, implying the inhibition of this pathway to avoid high oxygen consumption. It is thus concluded that one of the major mechanisms of SMI protection against IR injury was modulation of the myocardial energy metabolism to improve cardiac efficiency through multiple metabolic pathways including stimulating glucose metabolism and inhibiting fatty acid metabolism. It provided potential protein targets for the therapeutic strategy through modulation of the myocardial energy metabolism.", "journal": "Molecular bioSystems", "date": "2014-11-28", "authors": ["ShuyuZhan", "XiaohuiFan", "FengZhang", "YiWang", "LiyuanKang", "ZhengLi"], "doi": "10.1039/c4mb00161c"}

The aim of the current study was to explore the potential protective effect of mangiferin, a naturally occurring glucosylxanthone, that have antioxidant activity by its iron-complexing ability in mitochondria, against DOX-induced cardiac toxicity in rats in comparison with other antioxidants namely Sylimarin (SYL) and Vitamin E (VitE).\nMangiferin was given orally to rats at a dose of 50, and 100\u2009mg/kg for 5 weeks, and DOX was injected at a total dose of 15\u2009mg/kg. Cardiac toxicity was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in the serum, malondialdehyde (MDA) level in plasma and cardiac tissue, and antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in cardiac tissue.\nMangiferin protected against DOX-induced increased mortality and electrocardiogram abnormality and decreased biochemical markers of cardiac toxicity i.\u2009e., lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme. In addition, elevation of plasma and cardiac tissue levels of MDA in response to DOX treatment were significantly attenuated. The reduction of cardiac activity of SOD was significantly reduced in contrast with the other antioxidant SYL and Vit E. Histopathologically, mangiferin treatment showed significant reduction in inflammatory cell number, fibrotic area, and necrotic foci as compared with DOX only-treated rats.\nThese results suggested that mangiferin had better protective effect against DOX-induced cardiac toxicity in comparison with SYL and VitE, thus besides the antioxidant activity, different mechanism may be involved in the action of mangiferin and need to be clarified in the future studies.", "journal": "Drug research", "date": "2014-11-27", "authors": ["WArozal", "F DSuyatna", "VJuniantito", "D SRosdiana", "SAmurugam", "RAulia", "E RMonayo", "RSiswandi"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0034-1394457"}

Here, we report the cardiac effects of a novel positive inotropic peptide isolated from the toxin of the Black Judean scorpion that activates neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels.\nAll venoms and peptides were isolated from Black Judean Scorpions (Buthotus Hottentotta) caught in the Judean Desert. The full scorpion venom increased left ventricular function in sedated mice in vivo, prolonged ventricular repolarization, and provoked ventricular arrhythmias. An inotropic peptide (BjIP) isolated from the full venom by chromatography increased cardiac contractility but did neither provoke ventricular arrhythmias nor prolong cardiac repolarization. BjIP increased intracellular calcium in ventricular cardiomyocytes and prolonged inactivation of the cardiac sodium current. Low concentrations of tetrodotoxin (200 nmol/L) abolished the effect of BjIP on calcium transients and sodium current. BjIP did not alter the function of Nav1.5, but selectively activated the brain-type sodium channels Nav1.6 or Nav1.3 in cellular electrophysiological recordings obtained from rodent thalamic slices. Nav1.3 (SCN3A) mRNA was detected in human and mouse heart tissue.\nOur pilot experiments suggest that selective activation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive neuronal sodium channels can safely increase cardiac contractility.

We previously showed that cardiac MED13 modulates systemic energy homeostasis in mice. Here, we sought to define the extra-cardiac tissue(s) that respond to cardiac MED13 signaling. We show that cardiac overexpression of MED13 in transgenic (MED13cTg) mice confers a lean phenotype that is associated with increased lipid uptake, beta-oxidation and mitochondrial content in white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver. Cardiac expression of MED13 decreases metabolic gene expression in the heart but enhances them in WAT. Although exhibiting increased energy expenditure in the fed state, MED13cTg mice metabolically adapt to fasting. Furthermore, MED13cTg hearts oxidize fuel that is readily available, rendering them more efficient in the fed state. Parabiosis experiments in which circulations of wild-type and MED13cTg mice are joined, reveal that circulating factor(s) in MED13cTg mice promote enhanced metabolism and leanness. These findings demonstrate that MED13 acts within the heart to promote systemic energy expenditure in extra-cardiac energy depots and point to an unexplored metabolic communication system between the heart and other tissues.", "journal": "EMBO molecular medicine", "date": "2014-11-26", "authors": ["Kedryn KBaskin", "Chad EGrueter", "Christine MKusminski", "William LHolland", "Angie LBookout", "SantoshSatapati", "Y MeganKong", "Shawn CBurgess", "Craig RMalloy", "Philipp EScherer", "Christopher BNewgard", "RhondaBassel-Duby", "Eric NOlson"], "doi": "10.15252/emmm.201404218"}

Significant progress has been made in fabricating carbon nanoparticle-incorporated cell culture substrates, but limited studies have been reported on the development of three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs using these nanomaterials. Here, we present a novel approach to engineer 3D multi-layered constructs using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of cells separated with self-assembled graphene oxide (GO)-based thin films. The GO-based structures are shown to serve as cell adhesive sheets that effectively facilitate the formation of multi-layer cell constructs with interlayer connectivity. By controlling the amount of GO deposited in forming the thin films, the thickness of the multi-layer tissue constructs could be tuned with high cell viability. Specifically, this approach could be useful for creating dense and tightly connected cardiac tissues through the co-culture of cardiomyocytes and other cell types. In this work, we demonstrated the fabrication of stand-alone multi-layer cardiac tissues with strong spontaneous beating behavior and programmable pumping properties.

{"title": "The interplay of protein kinase A and perilipin 5 regulates cardiac lipolysis.", "abstract": "Defective lipolysis in mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase provokes severe cardiac steatosis and heart dysfunction, markedly shortening life span. Similarly, cardiac muscle (CM)-specific Plin5 overexpression (CM-Plin5) leads to severe triglyceride (TG) accumulation in cardiomyocytes via impairing TG breakdown. Interestingly, cardiac steatosis due to overexpression of Plin5 is compatible with normal heart function and life span indicating a more moderate impact of Plin5 overexpression on cardiac lipolysis and energy metabolism. We hypothesized that cardiac Plin5 overexpression does not constantly impair cardiac lipolysis. In line with this assumption, TG levels decreased in CM of fasted compared with nonfasted CM-Plin5 mice indicating that fasting may lead to a diminished barrier function of Plin5. Recent studies demonstrated that Plin5 is phosphorylated, and activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to phosphorylation of Plin5, suggesting that Plin5 is a substrate for PKA. Furthermore, any significance of Plin5 phosphorylation by PKA in the regulation of TG mobilization from lipid droplets (LDs) is unknown. Here, we show that the lipolytic barrier of Plin5-enriched LDs, either prepared from cardiac tissue of CM-Plin5 mice or Plin5-transfected cells, is abrogated by incubation with PKA. Notably, PKA-induced lipolysis of LDs enriched with Plin5 carrying a single mutation at serine 155 (PlinS155A) of the putative PKA phosphorylation site was substantially impaired revealing a critical role for PKA in Plin5-regulated lipolysis. The strong increase in protein levels of phosphorylated PKA in CM of Plin5 transgenic mice may partially restore fatty acid release from Plin5-enriched LDs, rendering these hearts compatible with normal heart function despite massive steatosis.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2014-11-25", "authors": ["Nina MPollak", "DorisJaeger", "StephanieKolleritsch", "RobertZimmermann", "RudolfZechner", "AchimLass", "GuenterHaemmerle"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M114.604744\n10.1002/hep.27409"}

The dynamics of phagocytes in left ventricular hypertrophy have not been systematically studied. Here, we characterized the temporal accumulation of leukocytes in the cardiac immune response by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy at day 3, 6 and 21 following transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac hypertrophy due to chronic pressure overload causes cardiac immune response and inflammation represented by an increase of immune cells at all three time points among which neutrophils reached their maximum at day 3 and macrophages at day 6. The cardiac macrophage population consisted of both Ly6C(low) and Ly6C(high) macrophages. Ly6C(low) macrophages were more abundant peaking at day 6 in response to pressure overload. During the development of cardiac hypertrophy the expression pattern of adhesion molecules was investigated by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. CD11b, CX3CR1 and ICAM-1 determined by qRT-PCR in whole cardiac tissue were up-regulated in response to pressure overload at day 3 and 6.

In fluorescence microscopy Ly6C(low) macrophages could be observed attached to the intra- and extra-vascular vessel-wall.

{"title": "Animal models to investigate the pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease.", "abstract": "Rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are sequelae of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. Although an autoimmune process has long been considered to be responsible for the initiation of RF/RHD, it is only in the last few decades that the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory condition have been unraveled partly due to experimentation on animal models. RF/RHD is a uniquely human condition and modeling this disease in animals is challenging. Antibody and T cell responses to recombinant GAS M protein (rM) and the subsequent interactions with cardiac tissue have been predominantly investigated using a rat autoimmune valvulitis model. In Lewis rats immunized with rM, the development of hallmark histological features akin to RF/RHD, both in the myocardial and in valvular tissue have been reported, with the generation of heart tissue cross-reactive antibodies and T cells. Recently, a Lewis rat model of Sydenham's chorea and related neuropsychiatric disorders has also been described. Rodent models are very useful for assessing disease mechanisms due to the availability of reagents to precisely determine sequential events following infection with GAS or post-challenge with specific proteins and or carbohydrate preparations from GAS. However, studies of cardiac function are more problematic in such models. In this review, a historical overview of animal models previously used and those that are currently available will be discussed in terms of their usefulness in modeling different aspects of the disease process.

Exposure to a simple PAH mixture during embryo development consisting of an AHR agonist (benzo(a)pyrene-BaP) with fluoranthene (FL), an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 1(CYP1)--a gene induced by AHR activation--results in cardiac deformities. Exposure to BaP or FL alone at similar concentrations alters heart rates, but does not induce morphological deformities.

Here, we used a zebrafish microarray analysis to identify heart-specific transcriptomic changes during early development that might underlie cardiotoxicity of BaP\u2009+\u2009FL.

Metabolite levels found in the host during an ongoing infection could provide valuable information on the pathogenesis and/or identify deregulated metabolic pathway that can be potential candidates for treatment and being potential specific biomarkers of the disease. To gain more insight into those aspects in Chagas disease, we performed an unprecedented metabolomic analysis in heart and plasma of mice infected with T. cruzi. Many metabolic pathways were profoundly affected by T. cruzi infection, such as glucose uptake, sorbitol pathway, fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis that were increased in heart tissue but decreased in plasma. Tricarboxylic acid cycle was decreased in heart tissue and plasma whereas reactive oxygen species production and uric acid formation were also deeply increased in infected hearts suggesting a stressful condition in the heart. While specific metabolites allantoin, kynurenine and p-cresol sulfate, resulting from nucleotide, tryptophan and phenylalanine/tyrosine metabolism, respectively, were increased in heart tissue and also in plasma. These results provide new valuable information on the pathogenesis of acute Chagas disease, unravel several new metabolic pathways susceptible of clinical management and identify metabolites useful as potential specific biomarkers for monitoring treatment and clinical severity in patients.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2014-11-21", "authors": ["N\u00fariaGiron\u00e8s", "Sof\u00edaCarbajosa", "N\u00e9stor AGuerrero", "CristinaPoveda", "CarlosChill\u00f3n-Marinas", "ManuelFresno"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0003337"}
{"title": "Mechanisms of disease: Mitochondrial dysfunction in sensory neuropathy and other complications in diabetes.", "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathy is a major complication of diabetes that involves the sensory and autonomic nervous systems and leads to significant morbidity and impact on quality of life of patients. Mitochondrial stress has been proposed as a major mediator of insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes and a trigger of diabetic complications such as nephropathy and cardiomyopathy in humans and animal models. Recent studies in the peripheral nervous system in type 1 and type 2 diabetic animal models suggest a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration in diabetes. This chapter focuses on the nature of sensory nerve dysfunction in diabetes and presents these findings in the context of diabetes-induced nerve degeneration mediated by alterations in mitochondrial physiology. Diabetes-induced dysfunction in calcium homeostasis is discussed and causative associations with suboptimal mitochondrial physiology are developed. Comparisons are made with mitochondrial-dependent dysfunction in muscle and cardiac tissue in diabetes. It is clear that across a range of complications of diabetes mitochondrial physiology is impaired; in general, a reduction in respiratory chain capability is apparent. Where appropriate, we provide clinical evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of complications in patients with diabetes. This abnormal activity may predispose mitochondria to generate elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), although experimental proof remains lacking, but more importantly will deleteriously alter the bioenergetic status of neurons.", "journal": "Handbook of clinical neurology", "date": "2014-11-21", "authors": ["PaulFernyhough", "JonathanMcGavock"], "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-444-53480-4.00027-8"}
{"title": "Identification of a human mitochondrial RNA that promotes tropomyosin synthesis and myocardial differentiation.", "abstract": "Heart disease is the number one killer in the USA, making cardiogenesis and its related pathways a relevant area of study for improving health and life expectancy. The Mexican salamander (axolotl), Ambystoma mexicanum, provides an excellent vertebrate animal model for studying myofibrillogenesis due to its naturally occurring cardiac nonfunction mutation. Homozygous recessive embryos do not develop normal hearts due to a lack of myofibril formation. In previous studies, myofibril-inducing ribonucleic acid (MIR) from the normal wild-type axolotl genome was found to rescue mutant nonfunctioning hearts through restoration of tropomyosin levels followed by normal myofibril formation. Our purpose in this study is to identify and characterize functional homologs for the MIR from human fetal heart ribonucleic acid (RNA). After randomized cloning of human fetal heart RNA, 396 clones were analyzed for rescuing ability by using mutant heart rescue bioassays and confocal microscopy. By these analyses, we discovered a functional homolog of MIR from human fetal heart RNA, which is associated with the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene. This RNA came from our clone #30 and induces tropomyosin synthesis and myofibrillogenesis in mutant axolotl hearts which ordinarily do not synthesize tropomyosin or form organized myofibrils. Clone #30, a mitochondrial RNA molecule associated with human cytochrome c oxidase, serves as a functional homolog of MIR, leading to tropomyosin production, organized myofibrils, and beating cardiac tissue in mutant hearts. These findings hold great potential for the treatment and repair of damaged hearts in patients who have suffered from myocardial infarctions and other heart diseases.", "journal": "In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

{"title": "The effects of thymoquinone and Doxorubicin on leukemia and cardiomyocyte cell lines.", "abstract": "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia remains the most common cancer for children, and if left untreated is rapidly fatal. The gold standard for treatment of ALL in children is with a class of drugs known as the antracyclines. Long term outcomes following treatment of leukemia with antracylines can result in cardiac abnormalities including arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, hypertension and left ventricular failure. Thymoquinone is a natural product that has demonstrated anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and chemo-protective effects in control trials as well as a reduction in cardiotoxicity in antracyline treated rats. The aims of the study were to determine if thymoqunione could be used to reduce leukemia cell viability without injuring primary cardiomyocyte, and to determine its effects if used in conjunction with a known chemotherapeutic agent. Cellular viability and morphological changes were observed in the, RAW leukemia cells and cardiac myocytes following treatment with thymoquinone, antracyline (doxorubicin), alone and in combination for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The results suggest that thymoquinone treatment in RAW leukemia cells reduced the cell number without altering the morphology, while doxorubicin reduced cell number and induced spindle cell formation and increased cellular damage. Findings also suggest RAW cell apoptosis increased in combination therapy with thymoquinone and doxorubicin. Thymoquinone administered to cardiomyocytes showed similar morphological changes as control over time in culture; whereas doxorubicin treated cells showed evidence of loss of connectivity and disruption of cell membranes. Combination treatment with doxorubicin and thymoquinone demonstrated significant cardiac myocyte survival at concentrations when used alone were able to reduce the leukemia cells. Overall, the data is promising and may provide a treatment regime to protect the heart tissue.

{"title": "Remodeling of cardiac passive electrical properties and susceptibility to ventricular and atrial arrhythmias.", "abstract": "Coordinated electrical activation of the heart is essential for the maintenance of a regular cardiac rhythm and effective contractions. Action potentials spread from one cell to the next via gap junction channels. Because of the elongated shape of cardiomyocytes, longitudinal resistivity is lower than transverse resistivity causing electrical anisotropy. Moreover, non-uniformity is created by clustering of gap junction channels at cell poles and by non-excitable structures such as collagenous strands, vessels or fibroblasts. Structural changes in cardiac disease often affect passive electrical properties by increasing non-uniformity and altering anisotropy. This disturbs normal electrical impulse propagation and is, consequently, a substrate for arrhythmia. However, to investigate how these structural changes lead to arrhythmias remains a challenge. One important mechanism, which may both cause and prevent arrhythmia, is the mismatch between current sources and sinks. Propagation of the electrical impulse requires a sufficient source of depolarizing current. In the case of a mismatch, the activated tissue (source) is not able to deliver enough depolarizing current to trigger an action potential in the non-activated tissue (sink). This eventually leads to conduction block. It has been suggested that in this situation a balanced geometrical distribution of gap junctions and reduced gap junction conductance may allow successful propagation. In contrast, source-sink mismatch can prevent spontaneous arrhythmogenic activity in a small number of cells from spreading over the ventricle, especially if gap junction conductance is enhanced. Beside gap junctions, cell geometry and non-cellular structures strongly modulate arrhythmogenic mechanisms. The present review elucidates these and other implications of passive electrical properties for cardiac rhythm and arrhythmogenesis.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2014-11-19", "authors": ["StefanDhein", "ThomasSeidel", "AidaSalameh", "JoannaJozwiak", "AnjaHagen", "MartinKostelka", "GerdHindricks", "Friedrich-WilhelmMohr"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2014.00424\n10.1161/01.RES.41.1.9\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000058461.86339.7E\n10.3389/fphar.2013.00130\n10.1152/ajpheart.00498.2011\n10.1161/01.RES.73.2.379\n10.1007/s00395-005-0571-2\n10.1136/hrt.2003.015347\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.07.014\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.09.017\n10.1159/000092569\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.01.008\n10.1063/1.166292\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.07.005\n10.1161/01.RES.0000122382.19400.14\n10.1161/01.RES.61.4.498\n10.1016/S0006-3495(83)84306-9\n10.1161/01.RES.64.3.501\n10.1007/s00285-008-0157-3\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.915\n10.1016/0735-1097(95)00612-5\n10.1161/01.CIR.77.3.589\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2006.00367.x\n10.1161/01.RES.60.5.780\n10.1016/S0165-6147(98)01192-4\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.01.019\n10.1007/s00210-014-0988-y\n10.1007/s002100100462\n10.1007/BF00241093\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01460.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.6.842\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1987.tb05974.x\n10.1161/01.RES.73.5.914\n10.1016/S0008-6363(96)00216-7\n10.1161/01.RES.0000089258.40661.0C\n10.1007/BF02363286\n10.1016/0014-4827(69)90029-9\n10.1016/S0167-5273(97)00183-6\n10.1136/hrt.45.3.248\n10.1093/cvr/cvp028\n10.1007/s11538-009-9421-y\n10.1017/S0033583501003705\n10.1097/01.fjc.0000200990.31611.6e\n10.1093/cvr/cvr189\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000016062.80020.11\n10.1098/rspb.1946.0024\n10.1093/europace/eum203\n10.1109/10.966596\n10.1016/S0006-3495(86)83559-7\n10.1007/s00210-008-0317-4\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.05.009\n10.1161/hc5001.100833\n10.1161/01.CIR.70.6.1074\n10.1152/physrev.00025.2003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.024\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.010\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00273-0\n10.1023/A:1021154115673\n10.1161/hc0902.104711\n10.1161/01.RES.0000046237.54156.0A\n10.1159/000092564\n10.1073/pnas.1010154107\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000121421.61896.24\n10.1083/jcb.74.2.629\n10.1172/JCI112701\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1997.tb00850.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00441.2003\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.03.003\n10.1073/pnas.0801089105\n10.1073/pnas.0500881102\n10.1016/S0014-2999(97)89679-3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.262345\n10.1002/cphy.c110051\n10.1146/annurev.ph.43.030181.002243\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.09.001\n10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78693-4\n10.1161/01.RES.72.3.631\n10.1007/BF02460876\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01443-7\n10.1007/s00232-012-9465-z\n10.1016/j.tcm.2012.12.005\n10.1161/01.RES.44.5.701\n10.1161/01.RES.50.3.342\n10.1529/biophysj.108.137349\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.035\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.957647\n10.1126/science.275.5301.841\n10.1007/s10439-009-9667-4\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2005.09.007\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00344.x\n10.1080/15419060802014404\n10.1109/TMI.2013.2240693\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.09.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.203828\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1994.tb01185.x\n10.1159/000092572\n10.1161/01.RES.80.1.124\n10.1161/01.RES.81.5.727\n10.1161/01.RES.58.3.356\n10.1161/01.RES.86.3.302\n10.1161/01.RES.50.2.175\n10.1161/01.CIR.59.2.247\n10.1146/annurev.ph.41.030179.002301\n10.1016/0022-5193(77)90114-X\n10.1007/s10439-005-7257-7\n10.1007/s00109-003-0437-8\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00017-6\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2050064\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.07.005\n10.1152/ajpheart.00760.2013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00868.2011\n10.1161/CIRCEP.112.975144\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.158\n10.1161/01.RES.63.1.72\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.06.042\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2003.02329.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvq329"}

We previously observed in the aged rat heart that sinus rhythm ventricular activation is delayed and characterized by abnormal epicardial patterns although conduction velocity is normal. While these findings relate to an advanced stage of aging, it is not yet known when and how ventricular electrical impairment originates and which is the underlying substrate. To address these points, we performed continuous telemetry ECG recordings in freely moving rats over a six-month period to monitor ECG waveform changes, heart rate variability and the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. At the end of the study, we performed in-vivo multiple lead epicardial recordings and histopathology of cardiac tissue. We found that the duration of ECG waves and intervals gradually increased and heart rate variability gradually decreased with age. Moreover, the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias gradually increased, with atrial arrhythmias exceeding ventricular arrhythmias. Epicardial multiple lead recordings confirmed abnormalities in ventricular activation patterns, likely attributable to distal conducting system dysfunctions. Microscopic analysis of aged heart specimens revealed multifocal connective tissue deposition and perinuclear myocytolysis in the atria.

These changes were validated by classical techniques and by novel and precise selected reaction monitoring analysis and RNA sequencing approach increasing the total heart samples up to 25. We found significant alterations in energy metabolism, especially in molecules involved in substrate utilization (ODPA, ETFD, DLDH), energy production (ATPA), other metabolic pathways (AL4A1) and protein synthesis (EFTU), obtaining considerable and specific relationships between the alterations detected in these processes.

{"title": "MicroRNA-221 inhibits autophagy and promotes heart failure by modulating the p27/CDK2/mTOR axis.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs have emerged as crucial regulators of cardiac homeostasis and remodeling in various cardiovascular diseases. We previously demonstrated that miR-221 regulated cardiac hypertrophy in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrated that the cardiac-specific overexpression of miR-221 in mice evoked cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. The lipidated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 was significantly decreased and sequestosome 1 was accumulated in cardiac tissues of transgenic (TG) mice, indicating that autophagy was impaired. Overexpression of miR-221 in vitro reduced autophagic flux through inhibiting autophagic vesicle formation. Furthermore, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was activated by miR-221, both in vivo and in vitro. The inactivation of mTOR abolished the miR-221-induced inhibition of autophagy and cardiac remodeling. Our previous study has demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 was a direct target of miR-221 in cardiomyocytes. Consistently, the expression of p27 was markedly suppressed in the myocardia of TG mice. Knockdown of p27 by siRNAs was sufficient to mimic the effects of miR-221 overexpression on mTOR activation and autophagy inhibition, whereas overexpression of p27 rescued miR-221-induced autophagic flux impairment. Inhibition of CDK2 restored the impaired autophagic flux and rescued the cardiac remodeling induced by either p27 knockdown or miR-221 overexpression. These findings reveal that miR-221 is an important regulator of autophagy balance and cardiac remodeling by modulating the p27/CDK2/mTOR axis, and implicate miR-221 as a therapeutic target in heart failure.", "journal": "Cell death and differentiation", "date": "2014-11-15", "authors": ["MSu", "JWang", "CWang", "XWang", "WDong", "WQiu", "YWang", "XZhao", "YZou", "LSong", "LZhang", "RHui"], "doi": "10.1038/cdd.2014.187"}
{"title": "Iron overload and apoptosis of HL-1 cardiomyocytes: effects of calcium channel blockade.", "abstract": "Iron overload cardiomyopathy that prevails in some forms of hemosiderosis is caused by excessive deposition of iron into the heart tissue and ensuing damage caused by a raise in labile cell iron. The underlying mechanisms of iron uptake into cardiomyocytes in iron overload condition are still under investigation. Both L-type calcium channels (LTCC) and T-type calcium channels (TTCC) have been proposed to be the main portals of non-transferrinic iron into heart cells, but controversies remain. Here, we investigated the roles of LTCC and TTCC as mediators of cardiac iron overload and cellular damage by using specific Calcium channel blockers as potential suppressors of labile Fe(II) and Fe(III) ingress in cultured cardiomyocytes and ensuing apoptosis.\nFe(II) and Fe(III) uptake was assessed by exposing HL-1 cardiomyocytes to iron sources and quantitative real-time fluorescence imaging of cytosolic labile iron with the fluorescent iron sensor calcein while iron-induced apoptosis was quantitatively measured by flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V. The role of calcium channels as routes of iron uptake was assessed by cell pretreatment with specific blockers of LTCC and TTCC.\nIron entered HL-1 cardiomyocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner and induced cardiac apoptosis via mitochondria-mediated caspase-3 dependent pathways. Blockade of LTCC but not of TTCC demonstrably inhibited the uptake of ferric but not of ferrous iron. However, neither channel blocker conferred cardiomyocytes with protection from iron-induced apoptosis.\nOur study implicates LTCC as major mediators of Fe(III) uptake into cardiomyocytes exposed to ferric salts but not necessarily as contributors to ensuing apoptosis. Thus, to the extent that apoptosis can be considered a biological indicator of damage, the etiopathology of cardiosiderotic damage that accompanies some forms of hemosiderosis would seem to be unrelated to LTCC or TTCC, but rather to other routes of iron ingress present in heart cells.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-11-13", "authors": ["Mei-pianChen", "Z IoavCabantchik", "ShingChan", "Godfrey Chi-fungChan", "Yiu-faiCheung"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0112915"}

To date, the prevalence, species distribution, and treatment responses of ciHHV-6 are unknown for cardiac patients.\nWe determined the prevalence of HHV-6 and ciHHV-6 genotypes in 1656 endomyocardial biopsies of patients with persisting unexplained symptoms of heart failure. Infection of cardiac tissue was identified by nested PCR, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Virus load and mRNA levels were followed in ciHHV-6 patients treated with ganciclovir. HHV-6 was detected in 273 of 1656 cardiac tissues (16.5%; HHV-6B, 98.2%, HHV-6A, 1.8%) by PCR. Nineteen of the 1656 patients (1.1%) presented with persistently high HHV-6 copy numbers indicative of ciHHV-6. Sequencing confirmed ciHHV-6A in seven patients (36.8%) which was considerably higher than detected in non-ciHHV-6 patients. Inheritance was demonstrated in three selected families, confirming ciHHV-6 chromosomal integration by PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. HHV-6 reactivation and chromosomal integration were confirmed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and heart tissue. Virus particles were identified in degenerating myocytes and interstitial cells. Antiviral treatment abolished viral mRNA and ameliorated cardiac symptoms.\nVirus replication in cardiac tissue of ciHHV-6 heart failure patients suggests that ciHHV-6 reactivation causes persistence of unexplained heart failure symptoms.

In the present study, sulindac, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), was tested for protection against oxidative stress-induced damage in an established RPE cell line (ARPE-19). Besides its established antiinflammatory activity, sulindac has previously been shown to protect cardiac tissue against ischemia/reperfusion damage, although the exact mechanism was not elucidated. As shown here, sulindac can also protect RPE cells from chemical oxidative damage or UV light by initiating a protective mechanism similar to what is observed in ischemic preconditioning (IPC) response. The mechanism of protection appears to be triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and involves known IPC signaling components such as PKG and PKC epsilon in addition to the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channel. Sulindac induced iNOS and Hsp70, late-phase IPC markers in the RPE cells. A unique feature of the sulindac protective response is that it involves activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-\u03b1). We have also used low-passage human fetal RPE and polarized primary fetal RPE cells to validate the basic observation that sulindac can protect retinal cells against oxidative stress.

There is clinical and preclinical evidence that neurological injury is responsible for high mortality and morbidity of patients even after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations in the brain during ischemia will enable the development of better targeted resuscitation protocols that repair the ischemic damage and minimize the additional damage caused by reperfusion.\nA validated whole body model of rodent arrest followed by resuscitation was utilized; animals were randomized into three groups: control, 30 minute asphyxial arrest, or 30 minutes asphyxial arrest followed by 60 min cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) resuscitation. Blood gases and hemodynamics were monitored during the procedures. An untargeted metabolic survey of heart and brain tissues following cardiac arrest and after CPB resuscitation was conducted to better define the alterations associated with each condition.\nAfter 30 min cardiac arrest and 60 min CPB, the rats exhibited no observable brain function and weakened heart function in a physiological assessment. Heart and brain tissues harvested following 30 min ischemia had significant changes in the concentration of metabolites in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, the brain had increased lysophospholipid content. CPB resuscitation significantly normalized metabolite concentrations in the heart tissue, but not in the brain tissue.\nThe observation that metabolic alterations are seen primarily during cardiac arrest suggests that the events of ischemia are the major cause of neurological damage in our rat model of asphyxia-CPB resuscitation.

In this study, the mitochondrial proteome in the cardiac tissue of ICM patients was analysed by quantitative differential electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry (MS) for the first time to provide new insights into cardiac dysfunction in this cardiomyopathy. We isolated mitochondria from LV samples of explanted hearts of ICM patients (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and control donors (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and used a proteomic approach to investigate the variations in mitochondrial protein expression. We found that most of the altered proteins were involved in cardiac energy metabolism (82%). We focused on ATPA, which is involved in energy production, and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, implicated in substrate utilization, and observed that these molecules were overexpressed and that the changes detected in the processes mediated by these proteins were closely related. Notably, we found that ATPA overexpression was associated with reduction in LV mass (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.74, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). We also found a substantial increase in the expression of elongation factor Tu, a molecule implicated in protein synthesis, and PRDX3, involved in the stress response. All of these changes were validated using classical techniques and by using novel and precise selected reaction monitoring analysis and an RNA sequencing approach, with the total heart samples being increased to 24.

{"title": "Effect of global cardiac ischemia on human ventricular fibrillation: insights from a multi-scale mechanistic model of the human heart.", "abstract": "Acute regional ischemia in the heart can lead to cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation (VF), which in turn compromise cardiac output and result in secondary global cardiac ischemia. The secondary ischemia may influence the underlying arrhythmia mechanism. A recent clinical study documents the effect of global cardiac ischaemia on the mechanisms of VF. During 150 seconds of global ischemia the dominant frequency of activation decreased, while after reperfusion it increased rapidly. At the same time the complexity of epicardial excitation, measured as the number of epicardical phase singularity points, remained approximately constant during ischemia. Here we perform numerical studies based on these clinical data and propose explanations for the observed dynamics of the period and complexity of activation patterns. In particular, we study the effects on ischemia in pseudo-1D and 2D cardiac tissue models as well as in an anatomically accurate model of human heart ventricles. We demonstrate that the fall of dominant frequency in VF during secondary ischemia can be explained by an increase in extracellular potassium, while the increase during reperfusion is consistent with washout of potassium and continued activation of the ATP-dependent potassium channels. We also suggest that memory effects are responsible for the observed complexity dynamics. In addition, we present unpublished clinical results of individual patient recordings and propose a way of estimating extracellular potassium and activation of ATP-dependent potassium channels from these measurements.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2014-11-07", "authors": ["Ivan VKazbanov", "Richard HClayton", "Martyn PNash", "Chris PBradley", "David JPaterson", "Martin PHayward", "PeterTaggart", "Alexander VPanfilov"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003891\n10.1109/CIC.2008.4749108"}

We infected C57BL/6j mice with Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and detected increased gene expression of anti-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines in the heart. Subsequently, we infected cardiac fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and macrophages with CVB3.

We found that in addition to cardiomyocytes cardiac fibroblasts were infected by CVB3 and displayed a higher virus replication (132-fold increase) compared to cardiomyocytes (14-fold increase) between 6 and 24 hours after infection. At higher virus concentrations, macrophages are able to reduce the viral copy number. At low virus concentration a persistent virus infection was determined.

At 8 \u00b0C, using a false discovery rate of 5%, neither anoxia nor re-oxygenation elicited appreciable changes in gene expression. By contrast, at 13 \u00b0C, 777 unique genes responded strongly. Up-regulated genes included those involved in protein turnover, the pentose phosphate pathway and cell morphogenesis while down-regulated gene categories included RNA splicing and transcription. Most genes were affected between one and seven days of anoxia, indicating gene regulation over the medium term but with few early response genes. Re-oxygenation for 7 days was sufficient to completely reverse these responses. Glycolysis displayed more complex responses with anoxia up-regulated transcripts for the key regulatory enzymes, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, but with down-regulation of most of the non-regulatory genes.

Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used for quantification of gene and protein expression in the heart. Fructose diet increased the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor and decreased the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor. On the other hand, estradiol replacement seems to undo fructose diet effects on cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor, and reversion of expression of both potentially protective molecules, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor, to the control level in cardiac tissue took place.

ROS are highly toxic since they can cause serious changes in proteins including ubiquitylation. Crocin (a carotenoid isolated from saffron), has protective effects against DZN cardiotoxicity. In this study level of total protein ubiquitylation as markers of oxidative stress and level of ubiquitin-HIF-1\u03b1 and P53, known substrates of ubiquitylation, in rat hearts exposed to DZN and crocin were evaluated.\nRats were divided into 7 groups: corn oil (control), DZN (15\u2009mg/kg/day, gavage), crocin (12.5, 25, 50\u2009mg/kg/day, i.\u2009p.) plus DZN, vitamin E (200\u2009IU/kg, i.\u2009p., 3 days a week) plus DZN and crocin (50\u2009mg/kg/day, i.\u2009p.). Treatments were continued for 4 weeks. Total protein ubiquitylation, total HIF-1\u03b1 and P53 were analyzed by western blotting. Total HIF-1\u03b1 and P53 were purified by immunoprecipitation (IP) and ubiquitin- HIF-1\u03b1 and P53 were analyzed by western blotting.\nHigher protein ubiquitylation levels were observed in DZN treated rats. Decrease in ubiquitin-HIF-1\u03b1 was also shown, and leads to higher HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels in DZN group. Crocin (50\u2009mg/kg) and vit. E protected cells against DZN protein ubiquitylation. Significant differences were not observed between the ubiquitin - P53 and total P53 protein levels.\nOur results showed that ubiquitylation could be considered as a marker of oxidative stress in rats exposed to DZN.

{"title": "Human cardiac systems electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis: iteration of experiment and computation.", "abstract": "Human cardiac electrophysiology (EP) is a unique system for computational modelling at multiple scales. Due to the complexity of the cardiac excitation sequence, coordinated activity must occur from the single channel to the entire myocardial syncytium. Thus, sophisticated computational algorithms have been developed to investigate cardiac EP at the level of ion channels, cardiomyocytes, multicellular tissues, and the whole heart. Although understanding of each functional level will ultimately be important to thoroughly understand mechanisms of physiology and disease, cardiac arrhythmias are expressly the product of cardiac tissue-containing enough cardiomyocytes to sustain a reentrant loop of activation. In addition, several properties of cardiac cellular EP, that are critical for arrhythmogenesis, are significantly altered by cell-to-cell coupling. However, relevant human cardiac EP data, upon which to develop or validate models at all scales, has been lacking. Thus, over several years, we have developed a paradigm for multiscale human heart physiology investigation and have recovered and studied over 300 human hearts. We have generated a rich experimental dataset, from which we better understand mechanisms of arrhythmia in human and can improve models of human cardiac EP. In addition, in collaboration with computational physiologists, we are developing a database for the deposition of human heart experimental data, including thorough experimental documentation.

Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 4 d with L-NAME in the absence or presence of (-)-epicatechin in the diet. The redox status in cardiac tissue was improved by (-)-epicatechin administration. L-NAME treatment induced a decrease in NO synthase activity (-62%, p<0.05) and an increase in NADPH-dependent superoxide anion production (+300%, p<0.05) that were totally prevented by (-)-epicatechin administration. These effects of (-)-epicatechin were associated with a higher endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation at an activation site and a reduced expression of the regulatory subunit, p47(phox), suggesting the involvement of posttranslational mechanisms in (-)-epicatechin action. Thus, the (-)-epicatechin treatment would restore NO steady state levels in vivo through effects on both, its synthesis and degradation via the reaction with superoxide anion.

{"title": "FHL2 expression and variants in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Based on evidence that FHL2 (four and a half LIM domains protein 2) negatively regulates cardiac hypertrophy we tested whether FHL2 altered expression or variants could be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a myocardial disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and increased interstitial fibrosis and is mainly caused by mutations in genes coding for sarcomeric proteins. FHL2 mRNA level, FHL2 protein level and I-band-binding density were lower in HCM patients than control individuals. Screening of 121 HCM patients without mutations in established disease genes identified 2 novel (T171M, V187L) and 4 known (R177Q, N226N, D268D, P273P) FHL2 variants in unrelated HCM families. We assessed the structural and functional consequences of the nonsynonymous substitutions after adeno-associated viral-mediated gene transfer in cardiac myocytes and in 3D-engineered heart tissue (EHT). Overexpression of FHL2 wild type or nonsynonymous substitutions in cardiac myocytes markedly down-regulated \u03b1-skeletal actin and partially blunted hypertrophy induced by phenylephrine or endothelin-1. After gene transfer in EHTs, force and velocity of both contraction and relaxation were higher with T171M and V187L FHL2 variants than wild type under basal conditions. Finally, chronic phenylephrine stimulation depressed EHT function in all groups, but to a lower extent in T171M-transduced EHTs. These data suggest that (1) FHL2 is down-regulated in HCM, (2) both FHL2 wild type and variants partially protected phenylephrine- or endothelin-1-induced hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes, and (3) FHL2 T171M and V187L nonsynonymous variants induced altered EHT contractility.

In an experimental in vivo mouse model of myocardial I/R as well as in the isolated I/R Langendorff-perfused rat heart, cardiomyocyte death was induced by eRNA and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 promoted further eRNA release especially under hypoxia, feeding a vicious cell damaging cycle during I/R with the massive production of oxygen radicals, mitochondrial obstruction, decrease in antioxidant enzymes and decline of cardiomyocyte functions. The administration of RNase1 significantly decreased myocardial infarction in both experimental models. This regimen allowed the reduction in cytokine release, normalisation of antioxidant enzymes as well as preservation of cardiac tissue. Thus, RNase1 administration provides a novel therapeutic regimen to interfere with the adverse eRNA-TNF-\u03b1 interplay and significantly reduces or prevents the pathological outcome of ischaemic heart disease.", "journal": "Thrombosis and haemostasis", "date": "2014-10-31", "authors": ["H ACabrera-Fuentes", "MRuiz-Meana", "SSimsekyilmaz", "SKostin", "JInserte", "MSaffarzadeh", "S PGaluska", "VVijayan", "IBarba", "GBarreto", "SFischer", "GLochnit", "O NIlinskaya", "EBaumgart-Vogt", "AB\u00f6ning", "SLecour", "D JHausenloy", "E ALiehn", "DGarcia-Dorado", "K-DSchl\u00fcter", "K TPreissner"], "doi": "10.1160/TH14-08-0703"}

Five to 6 weeks after injury, morphological and physiological properties of tdTomato(-) and tdTomato(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells were analyzed ex vivo. tdTomato(+) cells expressed cardiac myocyte markers, sarcomeric organization, excitation-contraction coupling, and action potentials characteristic of mature ventricular cardiac myocytes (tdTomato(-) cells). Reprogramming was associated with improvement of cardiac function, as analyzed by serial echocardiography. There was a time delayed and progressive improvement in fractional shortening and other measures of ventricular function, indicating that miR combo promotes functional recovery of damaged myocardium.\nThe findings from this study further validate the potential use of miRNA-mediated reprogramming as a therapeutic approach to promote cardiac regeneration after myocardial injury.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2014-10-30", "authors": ["Tilanthi MJayawardena", "Elizabeth AFinch", "LunanZhang", "HengtaoZhang", "Conrad PHodgkinson", "Richard EPratt", "Paul BRosenberg", "MariaMirotsou", "Victor JDzau"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304510"}

Pixel misalignment due to contraction is a main cause of the presence of gross motion artifacts in action potential recordings. This study is focused on methods for identifying landmarks and tracking the motion of cardiac tissue for preparations in optical mapping recordings. This is a first step toward our long-term goal to implement a landmark-based image registration technique to correct for pixel misalignment in cardiac optical mapping fluorescence videos and, hence, for gross motion artifacts. Preliminary results for the registration step are presented as an initial proof of concept. The characteristics of the optical mapping images are challenging, since their lack of contrast and well-defined features impose a limitation on the techniques than can be used for landmark selection and motion tracking. This paper compares results of motion estimation of the cardiac surface with two approaches that do not rely on high-contrast features: 1) Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) detected \"keypoints,\" to be used as landmarks for motion tracking, as well as 2) a classical global optical flow (OF) algorithm. Both are applied to low-contrast and low-resolution cardiac fluorescence images. We demonstrate that the performance of SIFT is superior to that of OF for pixel motion tracking in cardiac optical mapping images with simulated motion.

For example, TE approaches may be able to attenuate heart remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) and possibly increase total heart function to a near normal pre-MI level.(4) As with any functional tissue, successful regeneration of cardiac tissue involves the proper delivery of multiple cell types with environmental cues favoring integration and survival of the implanted cell/tissue graft. Engineered tissues should address multiple parameters including: soluble signals, cell-to-cell interactions, and matrix materials evaluated as delivery vehicles, their effects on cell survival, material strength, and facilitation of cell-to-tissue organization. Studies employing the direct injection of graft cells only ignore these essential elements.(2,5,6) A tissue design combining these ingredients has yet to be developed. Here, we present an example of integrated designs using layering of patterned cell sheets with two distinct types of biological-derived materials containing the target organ cell type and endothelial cells for enhancing new vessels formation in the \"tissue\". Although these studies focus on the generation of heart-like tissue, this tissue design can be applied to many organs other than heart with minimal design and material changes, and is meant to be an off-the-shelf product for regenerative therapies.

Then, tissue specific cells are cultured on the surface of the coated plates/micropattern surfaces to form cell sheets with strong lateral adhesions. Thirdly, a base matrix is created for the tissue by combining porous matrix with neovascular permissive hydrogels and endothelial cells.

{"title": "Distinct macrophage lineages contribute to disparate patterns of cardiac recovery and remodeling in the neonatal and adult heart.", "abstract": "The mechanistic basis for why inflammation is simultaneously both deleterious and essential for tissue repair is not fully understood. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged: Organs are replete with resident macrophages of embryonic origin distinct from monocyte-derived macrophages. This added complexity raises the question of whether distinct immune cells drive inflammatory and reparative activities after injury. Previous work has demonstrated that the neonatal heart has a remarkable capacity for tissue repair compared with the adult heart, offering an ideal context to examine these concepts. We hypothesized that unrecognized differences in macrophage composition is a key determinant of cardiac tissue repair. Using a genetic model of cardiomyocyte ablation, we demonstrated that neonatal mice expand a population of embryonic-derived resident cardiac macrophages, which generate minimal inflammation and promote cardiac recovery through cardiomyocyte proliferation and angiogenesis. During homeostasis, the adult heart contains embryonic-derived macrophages with similar properties. However, after injury, these cells were replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages that are proinflammatory and lacked reparative activities. Inhibition of monocyte recruitment to the adult heart preserved embryonic-derived macrophage subsets, reduced inflammation, and enhanced tissue repair.

Furthermore, proteomic analysis of heart tissue proteins following ISO treatment demonstrated detrimental effects on calcium signaling and energy generation in cardiac myocytes. It is worth noting that cardiac troponins were not identified in serum but were identified as altered in heart tissue lysate along with other cardiac-specific proteins. This strategy for cardiac biomarker discovery by proteomic screening of heart tissue proteins, followed by verification in serum samples using immunoassays or targeted mass spectrometry, could be applied in future biomarker studies.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2014-10-28", "authors": ["BenbenSong", "YashuLiu", "ToufanParman", "ShufengLiu", "Jennifer KMiller", "XiaohuaLiu", "Mary JTanga", "JonMirsalis"], "doi": "10.1021/pr500835w"}

A heterozygous missense mutation in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, p.S358L, has been genetically identified to cause autosomal dominant ARVC type 5 in a founder population from the island of Newfoundland, Canada. Little is known about the function of the TMEM43 protein or how it leads to the pathogenesis of ARVC. We sought to determine the distribution of TMEM43 and the effect of the p.S358L mutation on the expression and distribution of various intercalated (IC) disc proteins as well as functional effects on IC disc gap junction dye transfer and conduction velocity in cell culture. Through Western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence (IF), and electrophysiological analysis, our results showed that the stable expression of p.S358L mutation in the HL-1 cardiac cell line resulted in decreased Zonula Occludens (ZO-1) expression and the loss of ZO-1 localization to cell-cell junctions. Junctional Plakoglobin (JUP) and \u03b1-catenin proteins were redistributed to the cytoplasm with decreased localization to cell-cell junctions. Connexin-43 (Cx43) phosphorylation was altered, and there was reduced gap junction dye transfer and conduction velocity in mutant TMEM43-transfected cells. These observations suggest that expression of the p.S358L mutant of TMEM43 found in ARVC type 5 may affect localization of proteins involved in conduction, alter gap junction function and reduce conduction velocity in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-10-25", "authors": ["VinayakumarSiragam", "XuezhiCui", "StephaneMasse", "CameronAckerley", "ShabanaAafaqi", "LinnStrandberg", "MichaelTropak", "Michael DFridman", "KumaraswamyNanthakumar", "JunLiu", "YuSun", "BinSu", "CarolineWang", "XiaoruLiu", "YuqingYan", "ArielMendlowitz", "Robert MHamilton"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0109128"}

{"title": "Quantifying distortions in two-photon remote focussing microscope images using a volumetric calibration specimen.", "abstract": "Remote focussing microscopy allows sharp, in-focus images to be acquired at high speed from outside of the focal plane of an objective lens without any agitation of the specimen. However, without careful optical alignment, the advantages of remote focussing microscopy could be compromised by the introduction of depth-dependent scaling artifacts. To achieve an ideal alignment in a point-scanning remote focussing microscope, the lateral (XY) scan mirror pair must be imaged onto the back focal plane of both the reference and imaging objectives, in a telecentric arrangement. However, for many commercial objective lenses, it can be difficult to accurately locate the position of the back focal plane. This paper investigates the impact of this limitation on the fidelity of three-dimensional data sets of living cardiac tissue, specifically the introduction of distortions. These distortions limit the accuracy of sarcomere measurements taken directly from raw volumetric data. The origin of the distortion is first identified through simulation of a remote focussing microscope. Using a novel three-dimensional calibration specimen it was then possible to quantify experimentally the size of the distortion as a function of objective misalignment. Finally, by first approximating and then compensating the distortion in imaging data from whole heart rodent studies, the variance of sarcomere length (SL) measurements was reduced by almost 50%.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2014-10-24", "authors": ["Alexander DCorbett", "Rebecca A BBurton", "GilBub", "Patrick SSalter", "SimonTuohy", "Martin JBooth", "TonyWilson"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2014.00384\n10.1038/nmeth.2277\n10.1073/pnas.1109111108\n10.1364/OE.16.021843\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301704\n10.1364/OL.32.002007\n10.1016/j.optcom.2007.10.007\n10.1073/pnas.1111662109\n10.1152/ajpheart.00481.2009\n10.1038/nn.2116\n10.1364/BOE.2.002035\n10.1364/BOE.2.000113\n10.1364/BOE.5.000645\n10.1364/OE.18.021090\n10.1364/OE.21.011150\n10.1364/OE.18.013720\n10.1364/OE.19.013839\n10.1364/OE.22.017644\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.257803\n10.1007/978-0-387-45524-2_9"}

Recent studies show that inserting microRNA target sequences into the genomes of certain viruses can eradicate these viruses within local host tissues that specifically express the cognate microRNA. Here, we demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that incorporating target sequences for miRNA-133 and -206 into the 5' untranslated region of the CVB3 genome ameliorated CVB3 virulence in skeletal muscle and myocardial cells that specifically expressed the cognate cellular microRNAs. Compared to wild-type CVB3, viral replication of the engineered CVB3 was attenuated in human TE671 (rhabdomyosarcoma) and L6 (skeletal muscle) cell lines in vitro that expressed high levels of miRNA-206. In the in vivo murine CVB3-infection model, viral replication of the engineered CVB3 was attenuated specifically in the heart that expressed high levels of both miRNAs, but not in certain tissues, which allowed the host to retain the ability to induce a strong and protective humoral immune response against CVB3.

Limiting CVB3 replication within the heart may be a promising strategy to decrease CVB3 pathogenicity. miRNAs are \u223c21-nucleotide-long, tissue-specific endogenous small RNA molecules that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression by imperfectly binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR), the 5' UTR, or the coding region within a gene. In our study, muscle-specific miRNA targets (miRT) were incorporated into the CVB3 genome. Replication of the engineered viruses was restricted in the important heart tissue of infected mice, which reduced cardiac pathology and increased mouse survival. Meanwhile, replication ability was retained in other tissues, thus inducing a strong humoral immune response and providing long-term protection against CVB3 rechallenge.

In AMI-induced mice, prior proton irradiation improved cardiac function restoration and enhanced cardiac remodeling. This was associated with increased pro-survival gene expression in cardiac tissues. In contrast, cardiac function was significantly declined in (56)Fe ion-irradiated mice at 1 and 3 months but recovered at 10 months. In addition, (56)Fe ion-irradiation led to poorer cardiac function and more adverse remodeling in AMI-induced mice, and was associated with decreased angiogenesis and pro-survival factors in cardiac tissues at any time point examined up to 10 months.

{"title": "Stochastic precision analysis of 2D cardiac strain estimation in vivo.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic strain imaging has been applied to echocardiography and carries great potential to be used as a tool in the clinical setting. Two-dimensional (2D) strain estimation may be useful when studying the heart due to the complex, 3D deformation of the cardiac tissue. Increasing the framerate used for motion estimation, i.e. motion estimation rate (MER), has been shown to improve the precision of the strain estimation, although maintaining the spatial resolution necessary to view the entire heart structure in a single heartbeat remains challenging at high MERs. Two previously developed methods, the temporally unequispaced acquisition sequence (TUAS) and the diverging beam sequence (DBS), have been used in the past to successfully estimate in vivo axial strain at high MERs without compromising spatial resolution. In this study, a stochastic assessment of 2D strain estimation precision is performed in vivo for both sequences at varying MERs (65, 272, 544, 815\u2009Hz for TUAS; 250, 500, 1000, 2000\u2009Hz for DBS). 2D incremental strains were estimated during left ventricular contraction in five healthy volunteers using a normalized cross-correlation function and a least-squares strain estimator. Both sequences were shown capable of estimating 2D incremental strains in vivo. The conditional expected value of the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (E(SNRe|\u03b5)) was used to compare strain estimation precision of both sequences at multiple MERs over a wide range of clinical strain values. The results here indicate that axial strain estimation precision is much more dependent on MER than lateral strain estimation, while lateral estimation is more affected by strain magnitude. MER should be increased at least above 544\u2009Hz to avoid suboptimal axial strain estimation. Radial and circumferential strain estimations were influenced by the axial and lateral strain in different ways.

More importantly, electrophysiological studies demonstrated that a more mature ventricular-like cardiac phenotype was achieved when cells were treated with NRG-1\u03b2 and DMSO compared with DMSO alone. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that iPS-derived CMs were able to engraft and electromechanically couple to heart tissue, ultimately preserving cardiac function and inducing adequate heart tissue remodeling.

The kidneys, liver and heart tissue were collected for histopathological study. No lethality was observed during the experiment. All of the rats consumed the doses completely and no constipation was observed, suggesting the absence of any inhibitory effect on intestinal motion. Also, no abnormal neurological activity was detected, nor any significant elevation of AST, ALT or ALP levels, except for AST and ALT at the highest dose of 8 mg/g/day.

Overexpressing miR-34a levels increased the profibrogenic activity of TGF-\u03b21 in cardiac fibroblast, whereas inhibition miR-34a levels weakened the activity. Finally, we showed that miR-34a's underlying mechanism during cardiac fibrosis occurs through the targeting of Smad4 expression.\nOur findings provide evidence that miR-34a plays a critical role in the progression of cardiac tissue fibrosis by directly targeting Smad4, which suggests that miR-34a may be new marker for cardiac fibrosis progression and that inhibition of miR-34a may be a promising strategy in the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "Expert opinion on therapeutic targets", "date": "2014-10-18", "authors": ["YingHuang", "YuanQi", "Jian-QingDu", "Dai-fuZhang"], "doi": "10.1517/14728222.2014.961424"}
{"title": "Propionate stimulates pyruvate oxidation in the presence of acetate.", "abstract": "Flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in the heart may be reduced by various forms of injury to the myocardium, or by oxidation of alternative substrates in normal heart tissue. It is important to distinguish these two mechanisms because imaging of flux through PDH based on the appearance of hyperpolarized (HP) [(13)C]bicarbonate derived from HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate has been proposed as a method for identifying viable myocardium. The efficacy of propionate for increasing PDH flux in the setting of PDH inhibition by an alternative substrate was studied using isotopomer analysis paired with exams using HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate. Hearts from C57/bl6 mice were supplied with acetate (2 mM) and glucose (8.25 mM). (13)C NMR spectra were acquired in a cryogenically cooled probe at 14.1 Tesla. After addition of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate, (13)C NMR signals from lactate, alanine, malate, and aspartate were easily detected, in addition to small signals from bicarbonate and CO2. The addition of propionate (2 mM) increased appearance of HP [(13)C]bicarbonate >30-fold without change in O2 consumption. Isotopomer analysis of extracts from the freeze-clamped hearts indicated that acetate was the preferred substrate for energy production, glucose contribution to energy production was minimal, and anaplerosis was stimulated in the presence of propionate. Under conditions where production of acetyl-CoA is dominated by the availability of an alternative substrate, acetate, propionate markedly stimulated PDH flux as detected by the appearance of hyperpolarized [(13)C]bicarbonate from metabolism of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In contrast to cell injection, bioengineered tissue transplantation minimizes cell loss and has the potential to repair tissue defects. A popular approach is scaffold-based tissue engineering, which utilizes a biodegradable polymer scaffold for seeding cells; however, new techniques of cell sheet-based tissue engineering have been developed. Cell sheets are harvested from temperature-responsive culture dishes by simply lowering the temperature. Monolayer or stacked cell sheets are transplantable directly onto damaged tissues and cell sheet transplantation has already been clinically applied. Cardiac cell sheet stacking produces pulsatile heart tissue; however, lack of vasculature limits the viable tissue thickness to 3 layers. Multistep transplantation of triple-layer cardiac cell sheets cocultured with endothelial cells has been used to form thick vascularized cardiac tissue in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro functional blood vessel formation within 3-dimensional (3D) tissues has been realized by successfully imitating in vivo conditions. Triple-layer cardiac cell sheets containing endothelial cells were layered on vascular beds and the constructs were media-perfused using novel bioreactor systems. Interestingly, cocultured endothelial cells migrate into the vascular beds and form perfusable blood vessels. An in vitro multistep procedure has also enabled the fabrication of thick, vascularized heart tissues. Cell sheet-based tissue engineering has revealed great potential to fabricate 3D cardiac tissues and should contribute to future treatment of severe heart diseases and human tissue model production.", "journal": "Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "date": "2014-10-17", "authors": ["TatsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1253/circj.cj-14-0973"}

{"title": "Vascularisation for cardiac tissue engineering: the extracellular matrix.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases present a major socio-economic burden. One major problem underlying most cardiovascular and congenital heart diseases is the irreversible loss of contractile heart muscle cells, the cardiomyocytes. To reverse damage incurred by myocardial infarction or by surgical correction of cardiac malformations, the loss of cardiac tissue with a thickness of a few millimetres needs to be compensated. A promising approach to this issue is cardiac tissue engineering. In this review we focus on the problem of in vitro vascularisation as implantation of cardiac patches consisting of more than three layers of cardiomyocytes (>\u2009100 \u00b5m thick) already results in necrosis. We explain the need for vascularisation and elaborate on the importance to include non-myocytes in order to generate functional vascularised cardiac tissue. We discuss the potential of extracellular matrix molecules in promoting vascularisation and introduce nephronectin as an example of a new promising candidate. Finally, we discuss current biomaterial-based approaches including micropatterning, electrospinning, 3D micro-manufacturing technology and porogens.

{"title": "Local delivery of fluorescent dye for fiber-optics confocal microscopy of the living heart.", "abstract": "Fiber-optics confocal microscopy (FCM) is an emerging imaging technology with various applications in basic research and clinical diagnosis. FCM allows for real-time in situ microscopy of tissue at sub-cellular scale. Recently FCM has been investigated for cardiac imaging, in particular, for discrimination of cardiac tissue during pediatric open-heart surgery. FCM relies on fluorescent dyes. The current clinical approach of dye delivery is based on systemic injection, which is associated with high dye consumption, and adverse clinical events. In this study, we investigated approaches for local dye delivery during FCM imaging based on dye carriers attached to the imaging probe. Using three-dimensional confocal microscopy, automated bench tests, and FCM imaging we quantitatively characterized dye release of carriers composed of open-pore foam only and foam loaded with agarose hydrogel. In addition, we compared local dye delivery with a model of systemic dye delivery in the isolated perfused rodent heart. We measured the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of images acquired in various regions of the heart. Our evaluations showed that foam-agarose dye carriers exhibited a prolonged dye release vs. foam-only carriers. Foam-agarose dye carriers allowed reliable imaging of 5-9 lines, which is comparable to 4-8 min of continuous dye release. Our study in the living heart revealed that the SNR of FCM images using local and systemic dye delivery is not different. However, we observed differences in the imaged tissue microstructure with the two approaches. Structural features characteristic of microvasculature were solely observed for systemic dye delivery. Our findings suggest that local dye delivery approach for FCM imaging constitutes an important alternative to systemic dye delivery.

The chemical composition of airborne pollutants in Milano is similar to those of other European cities though with a higher PM2.5 fraction. Milano winter fine particles (PM2.5win) are characterized by the presence of nitrate, organic carbon fraction, with high amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and elements such as Pb, Al, Zn, V, Fe, Cr and others, with a negligible endotoxin presence. In BALB/c mice, we examined, at biochemical and transcriptomic levels, the adverse effects of repeated Milano PM2.5win exposure in lung and heart. We found that ET-1, Hsp70, Cyp1A1, Cyp1B1 and Hsp-70, HO-1, MPO respectively increased within lung and heart of PM2.5win-treated mice. The PM2.5win exposure had a strong impact on global gene expression of heart tissue (181 up-regulated and 178 down-regulated genes) but a lesser impact on lung tissue (14 up-regulated genes and 43 down-regulated genes). Focusing on modulated genes, in lung we found two- to three-fold changes of those genes related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposure and calcium signalling. Within heart the most striking aspect is the twofold to threefold increase in collagen and laminin related genes as well as in genes involved in calcium signaling.

Although several mechanisms have been suspected to be responsible for sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction, the precise cause(s) remains unclear to date.\nWe tested the hypothesis that cardiac fibroblasts may play a critical role as a disease modifier involved in sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction. Human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) cultured in\u00a0vitro were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Changes in cardiac morphology and function were assessed in mice with cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis.\nIn LPS-stimulated HCFs, messenger RNA and protein levels of proinflammatory molecules, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, were strikingly upregulated. LPS also increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, but not MMP-2. LPS-induced expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a classical marker for myoblast differentiation, which was abrogated when MMP-9 small interfering RNA was transfected into HCFs. High gene expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and MMP-9 were observed in the heart tissues of cecal ligation and puncture-induced septic mice. Histology sections of the hearts from septic mice showed perivascular and interstitial cardiac fibrosis, and echocardiography demonstrated that septic mice had profound cardiac dysfunction. The broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor ONO-4817 significantly alleviated these histologic and functional changes during the acute phase.\nWe suggest that cardiac fibroblasts are of pathogenetic importance in inflammation and fibrosis in the heart during sepsis, leading to cardiac dysfunction that would affect the outcome of sepsis syndrome.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2014-10-09", "authors": ["KengoTomita", "MitchinoriTakashina", "NatsumiMizuno", "KimimasaSakata", "KohshiHattori", "JojiImura", "WakanaOhashi", "YuichiHattori"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2014.09.012"}
{"title": "Ultrasound shear wave elasticity imaging quantifies coronary perfusion pressure effect on cardiac compliance.", "abstract": "Diastolic heart failure (DHF) is a major source of cardiac related morbidity and mortality in the world today. A major contributor to, or indicator of DHF is a change in cardiac compliance. Currently, there is no accepted clinical method to evaluate the compliance of cardiac tissue in diastolic dysfunction. Shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) is a novel ultrasound-based elastography technique that provides a measure of tissue stiffness. Coronary perfusion pressure affects cardiac stiffness during diastole; we sought to characterize the relationship between these two parameters using the SWEI technique. In this work, we demonstrate how changes in coronary perfusion pressure are reflected in a local SWEI measurement of stiffness during diastole. Eight Langendorff perfused isolated rabbit hearts were used in this study. Coronary perfusion pressure was changed in a randomized order (0-90 mmHg range) and SWEI measurements were recorded during diastole with each change. Coronary perfusion pressure and the SWEI measurement of stiffness had a positive linear correlation with the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the slope of 0.009-0.011 m/s/mmHg ( R(2) = 0.88 ). Furthermore, shear modulus was linearly correlated to the coronary perfusion pressure with the 95% CI of this slope of 0.035-0.042 kPa/mmHg ( R(2) = 0.83). In conclusion, diastolic SWEI measurements of stiffness can be used to characterize factors affecting cardiac compliance specifically the mechanical interaction (cross-talk) between perfusion pressure in the coronary vasculature and cardiac muscle.

The material consisted of hearts obtained from 90 pigs following slaughter and from pigs which had died. Oxidative stress was determined in heart lysates based on the concentration of TBARS and nitrite ions. Expression and concentration of Hsp70 were determined using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and ELISA. Expression of Hsp70 was observed in hearts lysates obtained from slaughtered pigs and from those which had died with symptoms of sudden death. The strongest reaction in the Western Blotting was noted in hearts lysates from pigs with no pathological changes. The highest TBARS concentration was observed in lysates from hearts in pigs which had died during or immediately after transport. The highest concentration of NO ions, determined as nitrite ions, was noted in hearts from pigs with myocardial infarction lesions. The significant decrease observed in Hsp70 concentration in heart tissue obtained from the pigs which had died in comparison to the hearts from healthy pigs indicates the important role of this protein in protecting the heart muscle against the destructive effects of stress, which limits the occurrence of post-stress cardiomyopathy in pigs following transport.", "journal": "Polish journal of veterinary sciences", "date": "2014-10-08", "authors": ["RUrban-Chmiel", "RPyz-\u0141ukasik", "ADudzic", "AWernicki"], "doi": "10.2478/pjvs-2014-0062"}

Furthermore, ALA reversed the downregulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) induced by Ang II. However, when cardiomyocytes were co-transfected with PARP-2 plasmid or siRNA for SIRT1, ALA failed to inhibit hypertrophic responses.

{"title": "Cytoprotective effect of melatonin against hypoxia/serum deprivation-induced cell death of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in vitro.", "abstract": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown great potential for cardiac regeneration. However the therapeutic efficiency has become a major obstacle due to the poor survival of transplanted MSCs in ischemic cardiac tissue. Previous studies reported that melatonin could protect many different types of cells from apoptosis under various pathological conditions. In the present study, we demonstrated that melatonin, an endogenously secreted indoleamine had cytoprotection from hypoxia/serum deprivation (Hy/SD)-induced cell death in MSCs. We further investigated the possible mechanism and found out that melatonin attenuated (Hy/SD)-induced cell death could be via effectively reducing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and then activation of caspase-3 in MSCs in response to Hy/SD exposure. Furthermore, melatonin pretreatment significantly modulated the expression of phospho-P38MAPK and phospho-ERK1/2 in Hy/SD-induced MSCs and the protective effects of melatonin were partially reversed by ERK1/2 inhibitor but not p38 inhibitor, suggesting that melatonin inhibited Hy/SD-induced MSCs cell death through the MAPK signaling pathway in part. Taken together, the findings imply that melatonin could improve the survival of engrafted MSCs under hypoxia and serum deprivation condition.

{"title": "Synthesis, characterization and antioxidant activity of a novel electroactive and biodegradable polyurethane for cardiac tissue engineering application.", "abstract": "There has been a growing trend towards applying conducting polymers for electrically excitable cells to increase electrical signal propagation within the cell-loaded substrates. A novel biodegradable electroactive polyurethane containing aniline pentamer (AP-PU) was synthesized and fully characterized by spectroscopic methods. To tune the physico-chemical properties and biocompatibility, the AP-PU was blended with polycaprolactone (PCL). The presence of electroactive moieties and the electroactivity behavior of the prepared films were confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. A conventional four probe analysis demonstrated the electrical conductivity of the films in the semiconductor range (~10(-5)S/cm). MTT assays using L929 mouse fibroblast and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) showed that the prepared blend (PB) displayed more cytocompatibility compared with AP-PU due to the introduction of a biocompatible PCL moiety. The in vitro cell culture also confirmed that PB was as supportive as tissue culture plate. The antioxidant activity of the AP-PU was proved using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay by employing UV-vis spectroscopy. In vitro degradation tests conducted in phosphate-buffered saline, pH7.4 and pH5.5, proved that the films were also biodegradable.

Unlike mammals, it has a remarkable heart repair capacity after injury, and promises novel translational applications. Amputation and cryoinjury models are key research tools for understanding injury response and regeneration in vivo. An understanding of the transcriptional responses following injury is needed to identify key players of heart tissue repair, as well as potential targets for boosting this property in humans.\nWe investigated amputation and cryoinjury in vivo models of heart damage in the zebrafish through unbiased, integrative analyses of independent molecular datasets. To detect genes with potential biological roles, we derived computational prediction models with microarray data from heart amputation experiments. We focused on a top-ranked set of genes highly activated in the early post-injury stage, whose activity was further verified in independent microarray datasets. Next, we performed independent validations of expression responses with qPCR in a cryoinjury model. Across in vivo models, the top candidates showed highly concordant responses at 1 and 3 days post-injury, which highlights the predictive power of our analysis strategies and the possible biological relevance of these genes. Top candidates are significantly involved in cell fate specification and differentiation, and include heart failure markers such as periostin, as well as potential new targets for heart regeneration. For example, ptgis and ca2 were overexpressed, while usp2a, a regulator of the p53 pathway, was down-regulated in our in vivo models. Interestingly, a high activity of ptgis and ca2 has been previously observed in failing hearts from rats and humans.\nWe identified genes with potential critical roles in the response to cardiac damage in the zebrafish.

CYP2J2 is the primary cytochrome P450 in the human heart and is most well known for the metabolism of AA to the biologically active epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. In this study, we demonstrate that both 2-AG and AEA are substrates for metabolism by CYP2J2 epoxygenase in the model membrane bilayers of nanodiscs. Reactions of CYP2J2 with AEA formed four AEA-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, whereas incubations with 2-AG yielded detectable levels of only two 2-AG epoxides. Notably, 2-AG was shown to undergo enzymatic oxidative cleavage to form AA through a NADPH-dependent reaction with CYP2J2 and cytochrome P450 reductase. The formation of the predominant AEA and 2-AG epoxides was confirmed using microsomes prepared from the left myocardium of porcine and bovine heart tissues. The nuances of the ligand-protein interactions were further characterized using spectral titrations, stopped-flow small-molecule ligand egress, and molecular modeling. The experimental and theoretical data were in agreement, which showed that substitution of the AA carboxylic acid with the 2-AG ester-glycerol changes the binding interaction of these lipids within the CYP2J2 active site, leading to different product distributions. In summary, we present data for the functional metabolomics of AEA and 2-AG by a membrane-bound cardiovascular epoxygenase.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2014-10-04", "authors": ["Daniel RMcDougle", "AmoghKambalyal", "Daryl DMeling", "AditiDas"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.114.216598"}
{"title": "miRNome in myocardial infarction: Future directions and perspective.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small and non-coding RNAs, are genome encoded from viruses to humans. They contribute to various developmental, physiological and pathological processes in living organisms. A huge amount of research results revealed that miRNAs regulate these processes also in the heart. miRNAs may have cell-type-specific or tissue-specific expression patterns or may be expressed ubiquitously. Primary studies of miRNA involvement in hypertrophy, heart failure and myocardial infarction analyzed miRNAs that are enriched in or specific for cardiomyocytes; however, growing evidence suggest that other miRNAs, not cardiac or muscle-specific, play a significant role in cardiovascular disease. Abnormal miRNA regulation has been shown to be involved in cardiac diseases, suggesting that miRNAs might affect cardiac structure and function. In this review, we focus on miRNAs that have been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI) and the response post-MI and characterized as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets. The majority of these studies were performed using mouse and rat models of MI, with a focus on the identification of basic cellular and molecular pathways involved in MI and in the response post-MI. Much research has also been performed on animal and human plasma samples from MI individuals to identify miRNAs that are possible prognostic and/or diagnostic targets of MI and other MI-related diseases.

{"title": "Mapping iron in human heart tissue with synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microscopy and cardiovascular magnetic resonance.", "abstract": "MRI assessment of cardiac iron is particularly important for assessing transfusion-dependent anaemia patients. However, comparing the iron distribution from histology or bulk samples to MRI is not ideal. Non-destructive, high-resolution imaging of post-mortem samples offers the ability to examine iron distributions across large samples at resolutions closer to those used in MRI. The aim of this ex vivo case study was to compare synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) elemental iron maps with magnetic resonance transverse relaxation rate maps of cardiac tissue samples from an iron-loaded patient.\nTwo 5\u00a0mm thick slices of formalin fixed cardiac tissue from a Diamond Blackfan anaemia patient were imaged in a 1.5\u00a0T MR scanner. R2 and R2* transverse relaxation rate maps were generated for both slices using RF pulse recalled spin echo and gradient echo acquisition sequences. The tissue samples were then imaged at the Australian Synchrotron on the X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy beamline using a focussed incident X-ray beam of 18.74\u00a0keV and the Maia 384 detector. The event data were analyzed to produce elemental iron maps (uncalibrated) at 25 to 60 microns image resolution.\nThe R2 and R2* maps and profiles for both samples showed very similar macro-scale spatial patterns compared to the XFM iron distribution. Iron appeared to preferentially load into the lateral epicardium wall and there was a strong gradient of decreasing iron, R2 and R2* from the epicardium to the endocardium in the lateral wall of the left ventricle and to a lesser extent in the septum. On co-registered images XFM iron was more strongly correlated to R2* (r\u2009=\u20090.86) than R2 (r\u2009=\u20090.79). There was a strong linear relationship between R2* and R2 (r\u2009=\u20090.87).\nThe close qualitative and quantitative agreement between the synchrotron XFM iron maps and MR relaxometry maps indicates that iron is a significant determinant of R2 and R2* in these ex vivo samples.

{"title": "Erbb2 is required for cardiac atrial electrical activity during development.", "abstract": "The heart is the first organ required to function during embryonic development and is absolutely necessary for embryo survival. Cardiac activity is dependent on both the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is the pacemaker of heart's electrical activity, and the cardiac conduction system which transduces the electrical signal though the heart tissue, leading to heart muscle contractions. Defects in the development of cardiac electrical function may lead to severe heart disorders. The Erbb2 (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) gene encodes a member of the EGF receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The Erbb2 receptor lacks ligand-binding activity but forms heterodimers with other EGF receptors, stabilising their ligand binding and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways. Erbb2 is absolutely necessary in normal embryonic development and homozygous mouse knock-out Erbb2 embryos die at embryonic day (E)10.5 due to severe cardiac defects. We have isolated a mouse line, l11Jus8, from a random chemical mutagenesis screen, which carries a hypomorphic missense mutation in the Erbb2 gene. Homozygous mutant embryos exhibit embryonic lethality by E12.5-13. The l11Jus8 mutants display cardiac haemorrhage and a failure of atrial function due to defects in atrial electrical signal propagation, leading to an atrial-specific conduction block, which does not affect ventricular conduction. The l11Jus8 mutant phenotype is distinct from those reported for Erbb2 knockout mouse mutants. Thus, the l11Jus8 mouse reveals a novel function of Erbb2 during atrial conduction system development, which when disrupted causes death at mid-gestation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-10-01", "authors": ["GennadiyTenin", "ChristopherClowes", "KathrynWolton", "EliskaKrejci", "Jayne AWright", "Simon CLovell", "DavidSedmera", "Kathryn EHentges"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0107041"}

Lack of FMR1 causes the most common neurological disorder, fragile X syndrome, while its overexpression is associated with metastasis of breast cancer. Its activity has been well-studied in nervous tissue, but recent evidence as well as its role in cancer indicates that it also acts in other tissues. We have investigated the expression of FMR1 in brain and other tissues of mouse and examined its regulation. We detected expression of FMR1 in liver and heart tissues of mice as well as in brain tissue, supporting other contentions that it acts in non-nervous tissue. Expression of FMR1 inversely correlated with expression of the C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) and, based on the known activity of CHIP in protein homeostasis, we suggest that CHIP regulates expression of FMR1. CHIP ubiquitinated FMR1 for proteasomal degradation in a molecular chaperone-independent manner. FMR1 expression was reduced following treatment with okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, but not in CHIP-depleted cells. Also, a non-phospho FMR1 mutant was much less efficiently ubiquitinated by CHIP and had a longer half-life compared to either wild-type FMR or a phospho-mimic mutant. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CHIP regulates the levels of FMR1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that CHIP regulates FMR1-mediated translational repression by regulating the levels of FMR1.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2014-10-01", "authors": ["Ye NaChoi", "Dar HeumJeong", "Ji SunLee", "Soon JiYoo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.09.099"}

The repair of cardiac tissue with cells delivered by an appropriate bioscaffold is expected to offer a superior, long-lasting treatment strategy. The present material, CardioCel\u00ae, is based on acellular pericardium that has been stabilized by treatments, including a low concentration of glutaraldehyde, that eliminate calcification after implantation. In the present study, we have assessed this material using human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells at various cell densities under standard, static cell culture conditions. The initial seeding densities were monitored to evaluate the extent of cell attachment and cell viability, with subsequent cell proliferation assessed up to 4 weeks using an MTS assay. Cell morphology, infiltration, and spreading were tracked using scanning electron microscopy and phalloidin staining. The efficacy of long-term cell survival was further assessed by examining the extent and type of new tissue formation on seeded scaffolds at 70 days; both type I and type III collagens were present in fibrillar structures on these scaffolds indicating that the seeded stem cells had the capacity to differentiate into collagen-producing cells necessary to repair damaged ECM. These data show that the CardioCel\u00ae scaffold is an appropriate substrate for the stem cells and has the potential to both retain seeded stem cells and to act as a template for cell propagation and new tissue formation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Maternal UN may also lead to disturbances in GH regulation in offspring. Because GH plays a key role in cardiac development, we used a model of maternal UN to examine the effects of neonatal GH treatment on cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac micro RNA (miRNA) profiles, and associated gene regulation in adult offspring. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a standard control diet (CON) or 50% of CON intake throughout pregnancy (UN). From neonatal day 3 until weaning (d 21), CON and UN pups received either saline (S) (CON-S, UN-S) or GH (2.5 \u03bcg/g\u00b7d) (CON-GH, UN-GH). Heart structure was determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and miRNA was isolated from cardiac tissue and miRNA expression analyzed using Cardiovascular miRNA gene Arrays (SABiosciences Ltd). Maternal UN caused marked increases in cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular cardiomyocyte area, which were reversed by preweaning GH treatment. Systolic blood pressure was increased in UN-S groups and normalized in UN-GH groups (CON-S 121 \u00b1 2 mmHg, CON-GH 115 \u00b1 3 mm Hg, UN-S 146 \u00b1 3 mmHg, and UN-GH 127 \u00b1 2 mmHg). GH treatment during early development facilitated a reversal of pathological changes in offspring hearts caused by UN during pregnancy. Specific cardiac miRNA profiles were exhibited in response to maternal UN, accompanied by up-regulation of the lethal-7 (LET-7) miRNA family in GH-treated offspring. miRNA target analysis revealed a number of genes associated with inflammation and cardiovascular development, which may be involved in the altered cardiac function of these offspring.

{"title": "Actin dynamics is rapidly regulated by the PTEN and PIP2 signaling pathways leading to myocyte hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Mature cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated, and the heart has limited capacity to replace lost myocytes. Thus adaptation of myocyte size plays an important role in the determination of cardiac function. The hypothesis tested is that regulation of the dynamic exchange of actin leads to cardiac hypertrophy. ANG II was used as a hypertrophic stimulant in mouse heart and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) in culture for assessment of a mechanism for regulation of actin dynamics by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Actin dynamics in NRVMs rapidly increased in a PIP2-dependent manner, measured by imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). A significant increase in PIP2 levels was found by immunoblotting in both adult mouse heart tissue and cultured NRVMs. Inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in NRVMs markedly blunted ANG II-induced increases in actin dynamics, the PIP2 level, and cell size. Furthermore, PTEN activity was dramatically upregulated in ANG II-treated NRVMs but downregulated when PTEN inhibitors were used. The time course of the rise in the PIP2 level was inversely related to the fall in the PIP3 level, which was significant by 30 min in ANG II-treated NRVMs. However, significant translocation of PTEN to the plasma membrane occurred by 10 min, suggesting a crucial initial step for PTEN for the cellular responses to ANG II. In conclusion, PTEN and PIP2 signaling may play an important role in myocyte hypertrophy by the regulation of actin filament dynamics, which is induced by ANG II stimulation.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Within this context, our purpose was to analyze the existence of a stock structure on sea lamprey populations sampled in the major Portuguese river basins using both morphological characters and heart tissue fatty acid signature. In both cases, the multiple discriminant analysis revealed statistically significant differences among groups, and the overall corrected classification rate estimated from cross-validation procedure was particularly high for the cardiac muscle fatty acid profiles (i.e. 83.8%). Morphometric characters were much more useful than meristic ones to discriminate stocks, and the most important variables for group differentiation were eye length, second dorsal fin length and branchial length. Fatty acid analysis showed that all lampreys from the southern Guadiana group were correctly classified and not mixing with individuals from any other group, reflecting a typical heart fatty acid signature. Our results revealed that 89.5% and 72.2% of the individuals from the Tagus and North/Central groups, respectively, were also correctly classified, despite some degree of overlap between individuals from these groups. The fatty acids that contributed to the observed segregation were C16:0; C17:0; C18:1\u03c99; C20:3\u03c96 and C22:2\u03c96. Detected differences are probably related with environmental variables to which lampreys may have been exposed, which leaded to different patterns of gene expression.

{"title": "Alcohol consumption during gestation causes histone3 lysine9 hyperacetylation and an alternation of expression of heart development-related genes in mice.", "abstract": "Alcohol abuse during gestation may cause congenital heart diseases (CHDs). The underlying mechanisms of alcohol-induced cardiac deformities are still not clear. Recent studies suggest that histone modification may play a crucial role in this pathological process. Moreover, our previous studies reported that ethanol could induce histone3 lysine9 (H3K9) hyperacetylation and overexpression of heart development-related genes in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of alcohol consumption during gestation on the imbalance of H3K9 acetylation and the alternation of the expression of heart development-related genes during cardiogenesis.\nPregnant mice were exposed to a single dose of alcohol (10 \u03bcl/g/d, 56% alcohol) by gavage every day in the morning from embryo day 7.5 (E7.5) to E15.5. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied for observing the structure of the embryonic hearts. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used for detecting the level of H3K9 acetylation and gene expression. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities were detected by colorimetric assay and fluorometric assay.\nH&E staining of cardiac tissue showed abnormalities of embryonic hearts at E17.5. The level of H3K9 acetylation reached peak at E17.5 and decreased sharply to a low level at birth and maintained at low level afterward. Alcohol exposure increased H3K9 acetylation at E11.5, E14.5, E17.5, and E18.5, respectively (p < 0.05), and enhanced the expression of Gata4 in the embryonic hearts at E14.5 and E17.5, Mef2c at E14.5, and Nkx2.5 at E14.5 and E17.5, (p < 0.05) but not for Tbx5 (p > 0.05). On embryonic day 17.5, HAT activities of embryonic hearts increased significantly, however alcohol exposure did not alter HDAC activities.\nThese data indicate a time course of H3K9 acetylation change during heart development and demonstrate that alcohol exposure in utero may induce an increase of HAT activities, which results in H3K9 hyperacetylation and an increase of the expression of heart development-related genes.

Cardiomyocytes are mostly devoid of nuclear glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and it is generally assumed that effects of adrenal steroids in heart are mediated through the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Here we used immunocytochemistry to study localization of corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) in semithin sections of human cardiac tissue samples. With staining of consecutive sections we examined colocalization with GR and MR immunoreactivities. While GR staining was almost undetectable, a portion of myocytes with MR immunostained nuclei was found. Almost all cardiomyocytes exhibited CBG immunostaining in cytoplasm and on the cell membrane. Most pronounced CBG immunoreactivities were found in Purkinje fibers and in smooth muscle cells of arterial walls. With RT-PCR, we found in homogenates of cardiac tissue detectable levels of CBG encoding mRNA. Our findings indicate that CBG is expressed in human heart. Known cardiac effects of adrenal steroids may in part be mediated through the binding globulin and its putative membrane receptor in addition to nuclear steroid receptors and direct genomic action. Highlights of our study: Human cardiomyocytes express mineralocorticoid receptors, but are mostly free of nuclear glucocorticoid receptors. CBG is expressed in myocardium and in Purkinje fibers.

Although we have developed human cardiac cell sheets by integration of cell sheet-based tissue engineering and scalable bioreactor culture, the risk of contamination by induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in cardiac cell sheets remains unresolved. In the present study, we established a novel culture method to fabricate human cardiac cell sheets with a decreased risk of iPS cell contamination while maintaining viabilities of iPS cell-derived cells, including cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, using a methionine-free culture condition. When cultured in the methionine-free condition, human iPS cells did not survive without feeder cells and could not proliferate or form colonies on feeder cells or in coculture with cells for cardiac cell sheet fabrication. When iPS cell-derived cells after the cardiac differentiation were transiently cultured in the methionine-free condition, gene expression of OCT3/4 and NANOG was downregulated significantly compared with that in the standard culture condition. Furthermore, in fabricated cardiac cell sheets, spontaneous and synchronous beating was observed in the whole area while maintaining or upregulating the expression of various cardiac and extracellular matrix genes.

Present study evaluates relative efficacy of SOMAH 'cardioplegia' at 4 and 21 \u00b0 C in preservation of optimum heart function after in vitro storage at subnormothermia.\nPorcine hearts arrested with SOMAH cardioplegia at 4 or 21 \u00b0 C were stored in SOMAH for 5-hour at 21 \u00b0 C (n\u2009=\u20095). At the end of storage, the weight of hearts was recorded and biopsies taken for cardiac tissue high energy phosphate level measurements. The hearts were then attached to a reperfusion apparatus and biochemical parameters including cardiac enzyme release and myocardial oxygen consumption and lactate production were determined in perfusate samples at regular intervals during ex vivo perfusion experiment. Functional evaluation of the hearts intraoperatively and ex vivo was performed by 2D echocardiography using trans-esophageal echocardiography probe.\nPost-storage heart weights were unaltered in both groups, while available high-energy phosphates (HEP) were greater in the 21 \u00b0 C group. Upon ex vivo reperfusion, coronary flow was significantly greater (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in 21 \u00b0 C group. 2D echo revealed a greater cardiac output, fractional area change and ejection fraction in 21 \u00b0 C group that was not significantly different than the 4 \u00b0 C group. However, unlike 4 \u00b0 C hearts, 21 \u00b0 C hearts did not require inotropic intervention.

Herein, we describe previously unrecognized microscopic lesions (microlesions) formed within the myocardium of mice, rhesus macaques, and humans during bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. In mice, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) severity correlated with levels of serum troponin, a marker for cardiac damage, the development of aberrant cardiac electrophysiology, and the number and size of cardiac microlesions. Microlesions were prominent in the ventricles, vacuolar in appearance with extracellular pneumococci, and remarkable due to the absence of infiltrating immune cells. The pore-forming toxin pneumolysin was required for microlesion formation but Interleukin-1\u03b2 was not detected at the microlesion site ruling out pneumolysin-mediated pyroptosis as a cause of cell death. Antibiotic treatment resulted in maturing of the lesions over one week with robust immune cell infiltration and collagen deposition suggestive of long-term cardiac scarring. Bacterial translocation into the heart tissue required the pneumococcal adhesin CbpA and the host ligands Laminin receptor (LR) and Platelet-activating factor receptor. Immunization of mice with a fusion construct of CbpA or the LR binding domain of CbpA with the pneumolysin toxoid L460D protected against microlesion formation.

This is of utmost importance for cardiac tissue engineering, since cardiomyocytes are extremely sensitive to malnutrition and hypoxia in vitro and after implantation. To develop a perfusable myocardial patch, we have focused on seeding a decellularized biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM) with endothelial cells. BioVaM is produced by decellularization of porcine small intestinal segments with preserved arterial and venous pedicles, which can be connected to a perfusion system in vitro or the host vasculature in vivo. The BioVaM vessel bed was re-seeded with porcine primary endothelial cells (pCEC). Seeding efficiency was influenced by detergent composition used for decellularization (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and/or Triton X-100) and the medium composition used for re-seeding. After decellularization, residual SDS was detected in the matrix affecting the survival of pCEC which showed a low tolerance to SDS and Triton X-100. Sensitivity to detergents was attenuated by supplementation of the medium with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or fetal calf serum (FCS). Pre-conditioning of the BioVaM with 20% FCS was not sufficient to attain pCEC survival in the vascular bed. However, re-cellularization was achieved by prolonged FCS supplementation during cultivation, resulting in a perfusable, re-endothelialized matrix of 11 cm2 in size.

For example, understanding cardiac differentiation during development will help to guide stem cell differentiation required for cardiac tissue engineering or to enhance endogenous repair mechanisms. We introduce different methodological frameworks to infer networks from expression data such as Boolean and Bayesian networks. Then we present currently available temporal expression data in heart development and discuss the use of network-based approaches in published studies. Collectively, our literature-based analysis indicates that gene network analysis constitutes a promising opportunity to infer therapy-relevant regulatory processes in heart development. However, the use of network-based approaches has so far been limited by the small amount of samples in available datasets.

{"title": "Antithrombin up-regulates AMP-activated protein kinase signalling during myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Antithrombin (AT) is a protein of the serpin superfamily involved in regulation of the proteolytic activity of the serine proteases of the coagulation system. AT is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties when it binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on vascular cells. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an important cardioprotective role during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R). To determine whether the cardioprotective signaling function of AT is mediated through the AMPK pathway, we evaluated the cardioprotective activities of wild-type AT and its two derivatives, one having high affinity and the other no affinity for heparin, in an acute I/R injury model in C57BL/6J mice in which the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded. The serpin derivatives were given 5 minutes before reperfusion. The results showed that AT-WT can activate AMPK in both in vivo and ex vivo conditions. Blocking AMPK activity abolished the cardioprotective function of AT against I/R injury. The AT derivative having high affinity for heparin was more effective in activating AMPK and in limiting infraction, but the derivative lacking affinity for heparin was inactive in eliciting AMPK-dependent cardioprotective activity. Activation of AMPK by AT inhibited the inflammatory c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway during I/R. Further studies revealed that the AMPK activity induced by AT also modulates cardiac substrate metabolism by increasing glucose oxidation but inhibiting fatty acid oxidation during I/R. These results suggest that AT binds to HSPGs on heart tissues to invoke a cardioprotective function by triggering cardiac AMPK activation, thereby attenuating JNK inflammatory signalling pathways and modulating substrate metabolism during I/R.", "journal": "Thrombosis and haemostasis", "date": "2014-09-19", "authors": ["YinaMa", "JinliWang", "JunjieGao", "HuiYang", "YanqingWang", "ChandrashekharaManithody", "JiLi", "Alireza RRezaie"], "doi": "10.1160/TH14-04-0360"}

Melatonin, a circadian molecule with marked antioxidant properties, protects against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. In particular, the myocardial protection of melatonin is substantial. We initially focus on the cardioprotective effects of melatonin in myocardial IR. These studies showed how melatonin preserves the microstructure of the cardiomyocyte and reduces myocardial IR injury. Thereafter, downstream signaling pathways of melatonin were summarized including Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, nitric oxide-synthase, and nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2. Herein, we propose the clinical applications of melatonin in several ischemic heart diseases.

However, humans lack this common mammalian cell surface molecule, Neu5Gc, due to inactivation of the CMAH gene during evolution. CMAH is one of several human-specific genes whose function has been lost by disruption or deletion of the coding frame. It has been suggested that CMAH inactivation has resulted in biochemical or physiological characteristics that have resulted in human-specific diseases.\nTo identify differential gene expression profiles associated with the loss of Neu5Gc expression, we performed microarray analysis using Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip, using the main tissues (lung, kidney, and heart) from control mice and CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (Cmah) gene knock-out mice, respectively. Out of a total of 25,697 genes, 204, 162, and 147 genes were found to be significantly modulated in the lung, kidney, and heart tissues of the Cmah null mouse, respectively. In this study, we examined the gene expression profiles, using three commercial pathway analysis software packages: Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, and Pathway Studio. The gene ontology analysis revealed that the top 6 biological processes of these genes included protein metabolism and modification, signal transduction, lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, immunity and defense, and carbohydrate metabolism. Gene interaction network analysis showed a common network that was common to the different tissues of the Cmah null mouse.

We hypothesized that PRCP function may be altered in heart tissue under conditions that predispose to left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH) in rats. We therefore used real-time PCR and western-blotting to examine the mRNA and protein expression of PRCP in the hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at pre-hypertensive (5-week-old) and hypertensive (16-week-old) stages compared with age-matched hypertensive (2 kidney-1 clip; 2K-1C) rats and normotensive Wistar rats. PRCP mRNA expression was significantly reduced in hearts of 5- and 16-week-old SHR compared with age-matched Wistar controls, 2K-1C hypertensive rats and sham-operated normotensive rats. There were no significant differences in the PRCP mRNA and protein expression levels in hearts from hypertensive renovascular and sham-operated normotensive rats. Prolonged treatment of SHR with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (40 mg/kg, gavage for 8 weeks) reduced the left ventricular weight/body weight ratio (LVW/BW), as well as the mRNA expression of collagen type 1, collagen type 3 and MMP9 in left ventricular tissue, without affecting PRCP gene and protein expression. Our results suggest that diminished PRCP gene and protein expression might be constitutionally involved in the SHR phenotype. In addition, since neither the development of arterial hypertension in the 2K-1C model nor its successful treatment in SHR altered PRCP gene and protein expression in heart tissue, it appears unlikely that PRCP function is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system or by afterload conditions.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2014-09-15", "authors": ["Rossana AndersonMarangoni", "Rosangela AparecidaSantos", "CamilaPiccolo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2014.08.016"}
{"title": "In vitro effects of exercise on the heart.", "abstract": "Pathologic and physiologic factors acting on the heart can produce consistent pressure changes, volume overload, or increased cardiac output. These changes may then lead to cardiac remodeling, ultimately resulting in cardiac hypertrophy. Exercise can also induce hypertrophy, primarily physiologic in nature. To determine the mechanisms responsible for each type of remodeling, it is important to examine the heart at the functional unit, the cardiomyocyte. Tests of individual cardiomyocyte function in vitro provide a deeper understanding of the changes occurring within the heart during hypertrophy. Examination of cardiomyocyte function during exercise primarily follows one of two pathways: the addition of hypertrophic inducing agents in vitro to normal cardiomyocytes, or the use of trained animal models and isolating cells following the development of hypertrophy in vivo. Due to the short lifespan of adult cardiomyocytes, a proportionately scant amount of research exists involving the direct stimulation of cells in vitro to induce hypertrophy. These attempts provide the only current evidence, as it is difficult to gather extensive data demonstrating cell growth as a result of in vitro physical stimulation. Researchers have created ways to combine skeletal myocytes with cardiomyocytes to produce functional muscle cells used to repair pathologic heart tissue, but continue to struggle with the short lifespan of these cells. While there have been promising findings regarding the mechanisms that surround cardiac hypertrophy in vitro, the translation of in vitro findings to in vivo function is not consistent.

We tested the hypothesis that dichloroacetate (DCA), an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase, enhances cardiac energy metabolism and Ca(2+) handling in female preparations and provide cardioprotection for hypoxic male tissue. Ventricle strips from sexually immature fish with very low (male) and nondetectable (female) plasma sex steroids were electrically paced in oxygenated or hypoxic Ringer solution with or without 1 mM DCA. In the presence of 5 mM glucose, aerobic tissue from male trout could be paced at a higher frequency (1.79 vs. 1.36 Hz) with lower resting tension and less contractile dysfunction than female tissue. At 0.5 Hz, DCA selectively reduced resting tension below baseline values and lactate efflux by 75% in aerobic female ventricle strips. DCA improved the functional recovery of developed twitch force, reduced lactate efflux by 50%, and doubled citrate in male preparations after hypoxia-reoxygenation. Independent of female sex steroids, reduced myocardial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and impaired carbohydrate oxidation might explain the higher lactate efflux, compromised function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and reduced mechanical performance of aerobic female tissue. Elevated oxidative metabolism and reduced glycolysis might also underlie the beneficial effects of DCA on the mechanical recovery of male cardiac tissue after hypoxia-reoxygenation. These results support the use of rainbow trout as an experimental model of sex differences of cardiovascular energetics and function, with the potential for modifying metabolic phenotypes and cardioprotection independent of sex steroids.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In this study, we investigate, in silico, the dynamics of rotors in two-dimensional and in an anatomical model of human ventricles using a Ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov (TNNP) model for ventricular cells. We study the effect of small size ionic heterogeneities, similar to those measured experimentally. It is shown that such heterogeneities cannot only anchor, but can also attract, rotors rotating at a substantial distance from the heterogeneity. This attraction distance depends on the extent of the heterogeneities and can be as large as 5-6 cm in realistic conditions.

Acute myocardial infarction and ischemic post-conditioning models were established in the rats. Six hours after reperfusion, 3 rats from each group were sacrificed and myocardial tissues were taken to measure the expressions of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (P-ERK), phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (P-JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38 MAPK), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), caspases-8 in the myocardial tissue, and cytochrome c in the cytosol using Western blot. Hemodynamics was measured at 24 hours after reperfusion, the blood was drawn for the determination of cardiac enzymes, and the heart tissue was collected for the measurement of apoptosis using TUNEL. One-way analysis of variance and the Q test were employed to determine differences in individual variables between the 5 groups.\nThree post-conditioning patterns were found to provide cardioprotection (P<0.05) compared with R/I without postconditioning. GIR provided the best cardioprotection effect, followed by ER and then GDR. Apoptotic index and serum marker levels were reduced more significantly in GIR than in ER (P<0.05). The enhanced cardioprotection provided by GIR was accompanied with significantly increased levels of P-ERK 1/2 (1.82\u00b10.22 vs. 1.54\u00b10.32, P<0.05), and lower levels of p-JNK, p38 MAPK, TNF-\u03b1, caspase-8, caspase-9 and cytochrome in the cytoplasm (P<0.05), compared with ER.

As aged cells have less regenerative capacity and are more susceptible to oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of ageing on SIRT3 levels and its correlation with antioxidant enzyme activities. Here, we show that severe oxidative stress reduces SIRT3 levels in young human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hMSCs). Overexpression of SIRT3 improved hMSCs resistance to the detrimental effects of oxidative stress. By activating manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase (CAT), SIRT3 protects hMSCs from apoptosis under stress. SIRT3 expression, levels of MnSOD and CAT, as well as cell survival showed little difference in old versus young hMSCs under normal growth conditions, whereas older cells had a significantly reduced capacity to withstand oxidative stress compared to their younger counterparts. Expression of the short 28\u00a0kD SIRT3 isoform was higher, while the long 44\u00a0kD isoform expression was lower in young myocardial tissues compared with older ones. These results suggest that the active short isoform of SIRT3 protects hMSCs from oxidative injury by increasing the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes.

Next, we intramyocardially injected mouse CM cell line HL-1 CMs with or without PA-RGDS into uninjured hearts. Histologic examination and flow cytometry analysis of digested heart tissues showed approximately 3-fold higher engraftment in the mice that received CMs with PA-RGDS compared to those without PA-RGDS. We further investigated the therapeutic effects and long-term engraftment of mESC-CMs with PA-RGDS on MI in comparison with PBS control, CM-only, and PA-RGDS only. Echocardiography demonstrated that the CM-only and CM+PA-RGDS groups showed higher cardiac function at week 2 compared to other groups. However, from 3 weeks, higher cardiac function was maintained only in the CM+PA-RGDS group; this was sustained for 12 weeks. Confocal microscopic examination of the cardiac tissues harvested at 14 weeks demonstrated sustained engraftment and integration of mESC-CMs into host myocardium in the CM+PA-RGDS group only.

Accumulated evidence suggests that microRNAs are essential regulators of cardiac remodelling. We have been suggested that microRNAs could play a role in the process of HCM. To uncover which microRNAs were changed in their expression, microRNA microarrays were performed on heart tissue from HCM patients (n\u00a0=\u00a07) and from healthy donors (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Among the 13 microRNAs that were differentially expressed in HCM, miR-451 was the most down-regulated. Ectopic overexpression of miR-451 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) decreased the cell size, whereas knockdown of endogenous miR-451 increased the cell surface area. Luciferase reporter assay analyses demonstrated that tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) was a direct target of miR-451. Overexpression of miR-451 in both HeLa cells and NRCM suppressed the expression of TSC1. Furthermore, TSC1 was significantly up-regulated in HCM myocardia, which correlated with the decreased levels of miR-451. As TSC1 is a known positive regulator of autophagy, we examined the role of miR-451 in the regulation of autophagy. Overexpression of miR-451 in vitro inhibited the formation of the autophagosome. Conversely, miR-451 knockdown accelerated autophagosome formation. Consistently, an increased number of autophagosomes was observed in HCM myocardia, accompanied by up-regulated autophagy markers, and the lipidated form of LC3 and Beclin-1. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-451 regulates cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac autophagy by targeting TSC1.

The Ito-blocker inhibitor 4-aminopyridine increased action potential duration and T2 and caused aftercontractions, which were abolished by inhibitors of ryanodine receptors (RyR2; JTV-519) or sodium calcium exchanger (NCX; SEA0400). 77 Drugs were then tested at 1-10-100\u00d7 free therapeutic plasma concentrations (FTPC): Inhibitors of IKr, IKs, Ito, antiarrhythmics (8), drugs withdrawn from market for torsades des pointes arrhythmias (TdP, 5), drugs with measurable (7) or isolated TdP incidence (13), drugs considered safe (14), 28 new chemical entities (NCE). Inhibitors of IKr or IKs had no effect alone, but substantially prolonged relaxation time (T2) when combined at high concentration. 15/33 drugs associated with TdP and 6/14 drugs considered non-torsadogenic (cibenzoline, diltiazem, ebastine, ketoconazole, moxifloxacin, and phenytoin) induced concentration-dependent T2 prolongations (10-100\u00d7 FTPC).

The specific objective of this article is to investigate whether low-dose Dox treatment had pro-autophagic effects in cardiomyocytes as well as osteosarcoma cells.\nThis study characterises apoptotic (Bax) and autophagic (Beclin-1) biomarker levels in human OS and cardiomyocyte cell lines as well as in various tissues when mice are exposed to low (1 mg/kg, thrice weekly) and high (3 mg/kg thrice weekly) dose Dox for a month.\nThere was a decrease in Bax and increase in Beclin-1 in cardiac tissue in the high-dose group. Dox decreased Beclin-1 in the skin and liver, with no clear indication in the stomach, small intestine and testis. At low Dox doses of 10 and 100 nm in cardiomyocytes and OS cells, there is a pro-apoptotic effect, with a quicker response in the 100-nm condition, and a slower but steady increase of a pro-apoptotic response at the lower 10-nm dose.

Human prostate, breast and colorectal cells treated with 10-nm Dox showed \u223c 40% reduction in cell viability after 24 h.\nIn culture, cells of both cardiomyocytes and OS revealed a predominant pro-apoptotic response at the expense of autophagy, although both seemed to be occurring in vivo.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology", "date": "2014-09-12", "authors": ["OktayTacar", "SivanjahIndumathy", "Mei LinTan", "SwatiBaindur-Hudson", "Anna MFriedhuber", "Crispin RDass"], "doi": "10.1111/jphp.12324"}
{"title": "Research/review: Insights into the mutation-induced dysfunction of arachidonic acid metabolism from modeling of human CYP2J2.", "abstract": "As a kind of monooxygenase with the function of catalyzing many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids, CYP2J2 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. Located at the endoplasmic reticulum, CYP2J2 is responsible for epoxidation of endogenous arachidonic acid in cardiac tissue to produce cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have anti-inflammatory and antifibrinolytic properties, and can protect endothelial cells from ischemic or hypoxic injuries. Some polymorphisms, e.g., CYP2J2 with mutation T143A, R158C, I192N or N404Y, could significantly reduce the metabolism of the arachidonic acid, causing or deteriorating the coronary artery disease. However, so far the detailed mechanism for the mutationinduced dysfunction of arachidonic metabolism is still unknown. To reveal its mechanism, a 3D (three-dimensional) structure for human CYP2J2 was developed, followed by docking the arachidonic acid ligand into the active site of the receptor. It was observed based on the binding mode thus found that Gly486 and Leu378 in the active site of the receptor played a key role in recognizing and positioning the carboxyl group of the ligand via hydrogen bonding interactions, and that any of the aforementioned five mutations might have, either directly or indirectly, impact to their role and hence causing the mutation-induced dysfunction of CYP2J2-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism. It is anticipated that the findings as reported in this review article may stimulate new strategy for finding novel therapeutic approaches to treat coronary artery disease.", "journal": "Current drug metabolism", "date": "2014-09-11", "authors": ["Xiao-LeXia", "Bo-TaoFa", "ShanCong", "Jing-FangWang", "Kuo-ChenChou"], "doi": "10.2174/1389200215666140908095647"}

This study evaluated the effects of rutin treatment in serum, heart and liver tissues of rats subjected to a combination of hypercaloric diet (HD) and chronic ethanol consumption. Rats were divided into three groups: Control: rats fed a standard diet and drinking water ad libitum; G1: rats fed the HD and receiving a solution of 10% (v/v) ethanol; and G2: rats fed the HD and ethanol solution, followed by injections of 50 mg/kg(-1) rutin as treatment. After 53 days of HD and ethanol exposure, the rutin was administered every three days for nine days. At the end of the experimental period (95 days), biochemical analyses were carried out on sera, cardiac and hepatic tissues. Body weight gain and food consumption were reduced in both the G1 and G2 groups compared to control animals. Rutin effectively reduced the total lipids (TL), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), VLDL, LDL-cholesterol and glucose levels, while it increased the HDL-cholesterol in the serum of G2 rats, compared to G1. Although rutin had no effect on total protein, albumin, uric acid and cretinine levels, it was able to restore serum activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) in animals fed HD and receiving ethanol. Glycogen stores were replenished in both hepatic and cardiac tissues after rutin treatment. Moreover, rutin consistently reduced hepatic levels of TG and TC and cardiac AST, ALT and CK activities. Thus, rutin treatment was effective in reducing the risk factors for cardiac and hepatic disease caused by both HD and chronic ethanol consumption.", "journal": "Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics", "date": "2014-09-11", "authors": ["Luiz Gustavo AChuffa", "Beatriz AFioruci-Fontanelli", "Juliana GBordon", "Rafaelle BPires", "Camila PBraga", "F\u00e1bio R FSeiva", "Ana Ang\u00e9lica HFernandes"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Investigating the role of uncoupling of troponin I phosphorylation from changes in myofibrillar Ca(2+)-sensitivity in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Contraction in the mammalian heart is controlled by the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration as it is in all striated muscle, but the heart has an additional signaling system that comes into play to increase heart rate and cardiac output during exercise or stress. \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation of heart muscle cells leads to release of cyclic-AMP and the activation of protein kinase A which phosphorylates key proteins in the sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum and contractile apparatus. Troponin I (TnI) and Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C) are the prime targets in the myofilaments. TnI phosphorylation lowers myofibrillar Ca(2+)-sensitivity and increases the speed of Ca(2+)-dissociation and relaxation (lusitropic effect). Recent studies have shown that this relationship between Ca(2+)-sensitivity and TnI phosphorylation may be unstable. In familial cardiomyopathies, both dilated and hypertrophic (DCM and HCM), a mutation in one of the proteins of the thin filament often results in the loss of the relationship (uncoupling) and blunting of the lusitropic response. For familial dilated cardiomyopathy in thin filament proteins it has been proposed that this uncoupling is causative of the phenotype. Uncoupling has also been found in human heart tissue from patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy as a secondary effect. Recently, it has been found that Ca(2+)-sensitizing drugs can promote uncoupling, whilst one Ca(2+)-desensitizing drug Epigallocatechin 3-Gallate (EGCG) can reverse uncoupling. We will discuss recent findings about the role of uncoupling in the development of cardiomyopathies and the molecular mechanism of the process.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["Andrew EMesser", "Steven BMarston"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2014.00315\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20347.x\n10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2560535.x\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.113.000324\n10.1515/bchm.1998.379.3.341\n10.1021/bi900739f\n10.1016/j.jmb.2007.10.062\n10.1093/cvr/cvr336\n10.1093/cvr/cvs322\n10.1161/01.RES.0000267744.92677.7f\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.5.1495\n10.1161/01.CIR.77.3.625\n10.1371/journal.pone.0070556\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.196055\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.009\n10.1161/01.RES.0000164359.95588.25\n10.1007/s10741-005-5252-6\n10.1007/s10974-010-9224-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.007\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2003.08.003\n10.1021/bi0115232\n10.1016/0014-5793(95)01319-9\n10.1021/bi700574n\n10.1074/jbc.M703822200\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.106.146670\n10.1016/0002-8703(92)90278-4\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.108.818237\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.05.003\n10.1124/mol.112.079707\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.0143z.x\n10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01881-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.03.437\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.05.013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.04.014\n10.1152/ajpheart.01143.2008\n10.1007/s10974-008-9160-y\n10.1161/01.RES.0000149299.34793.3c\n10.1161/01.RES.0000060027.40275.A6\n10.1016/j.jmb.2007.08.035\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.07.001\n10.1093/cvr/cvn094\n10.1007/s10974-009-9174-0\n10.1172/JCI15967\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.02.002\n10.1017/S1047951107001291\n10.1038/344265a0\n10.1161/hh1001.091640\n10.1074/mcp.T500024-MCP200\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.206243\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.245787\n10.1074/jbc.M006745200\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.10.014\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.01.002\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.12.022\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079363\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.108\n10.1371/journal.pone.0038259\n10.1016/j.abb.2012.05.024\n10.1021/bi200506k\n10.1007/s12265-011-9266-2\n10.1016/j.vjmcc.2013.10.011\n10.1007/s10974-009-9184-y\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.07.004\n10.1093/cvr/cvt071\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.08.017\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.11.3033\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.11.4010\n10.1002/prca.200900071\n10.1074/jbc.M412281200\n10.1016/0014-5793(90)81046-Q\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.08.027\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.02.004\n10.1085/jgp.75.3.271\n10.1093/cvr/cvm084\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00371-X\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.09.001\n10.1074/jbc.M111.323048\n10.1161/01.RES.0000014080.82861.5F\n10.1074/jbc.M111.267211\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.148379\n10.1016/0014-5793(76)80716-8\n10.1074/jbc.M109.021352\n10.1007/s10974-009-9168-y\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.05001.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.300436\n10.1038/262615a0\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.114\n10.1074/jbc.M111.252320\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.05.009\n10.1002/pmic.200300434\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.07.011\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00942.x\n10.1038/nature01780\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00606-5\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.11.1730\n10.1074/jbc.M111.294306\n10.1074/jbc.M111.294306\n10.1021/bi036128l\n10.1021/bi036310m\n10.1161/01.RES.76.5.781\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.106.145557\n10.1074/mcp.M700524-MCP200\n10.1002/prca.200600891"}

Importantly, this effect was specific to CTS because transplantation of skeletal muscle tissue slices led to faster dilative remodeling and higher animal mortality.\nIn summary, this is the first study to use CTS as a benchmark to validate and model tissue-engineered graft studies. CTS transplantation improved cell survival, established reperfusion, and enhanced cardiac function after myocardial infarction. These findings also confirm that dilative remodeling can be attenuated by topical transplantation of CTS but not skeletal muscle tissue grafts.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["JohannesRiegler", "AstridGillich", "QiShen", "Joseph DGold", "Joseph CWu"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007920"}
{"title": "Hyperglycemia inhibits cardiac stem cell-mediated cardiac repair and angiogenic capacity.", "abstract": "The impact of diabetes mellitus on the cardiac regenerative potential of cardiac stem cells (CSCs) is unknown yet critical, given that individuals with diabetes mellitus may well require CSC therapy in the future. Using human and murine CSCs from diabetic cardiac tissue, we tested the hypothesis that hyperglycemic conditions impair CSC function.\nCSCs cultured from the cardiac biopsies of patients with diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c, 10\u00b12%) demonstrated reduced overall cell numbers compared with nondiabetic sourced biopsies (P=0.04). When injected into the infarct border zone of immunodeficient mice 1 week after myocardial infarction, CSCs from patients with diabetes mellitus demonstrated reduced cardiac repair compared with nondiabetic patients. Conditioned medium from CSCs of patients with diabetes mellitus displayed a reduced ability to promote in vitro blood vessel formation (P=0.02). Similarly, conditioned medium from CSCs cultured from the cardiac biopsies of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice displayed impaired angiogenic capacity (P=0.0008). Somatic gene transfer of the methylglyoxal detoxification enzyme, glyoxalase-1, restored the angiogenic capacity of diabetic CSCs (diabetic transgenic versus nondiabetic transgenic; P=0.8). Culture of nondiabetic murine cardiac biopsies under high (25 mmol/L) glucose conditions reduced CSC yield (P=0.003), impaired angiogenic (P=0.02) and chemotactic (P=0.003) response, and reduced CSC-mediated cardiac repair (P<0.05).\nDiabetes mellitus reduces the ability of CSCs to repair injured myocardium. Both diabetes mellitus and preconditioning CSCs in high glucose attenuated the proangiogenic capacity of CSCs. Increased expression of glyoxalase-1 restored the proangiogenic capacity of diabetic CSCs, suggesting a means of reversing diabetic CSC dysfunction by interfering with the accumulation of reactive dicarbonyls.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 S DMolgat", "Everad LTilokee", "GhazalehRafatian", "BrankaVulesevic", "MarcRuel", "RossMilne", "Erik JSuuronen", "Darryl RDavis"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007908"}

Consequently, alternative therapeutic strategies have been intensively investigated, especially methods of enhancing the heart's resistance to ischemic cell death - so called \"cardioprotective\" interventions. However, although a great deal has been learned regarding the methods and mechanisms of cardioprotective interventions, an efficacious therapy has yet to be successfully implemented in the clinical arena.

The GNAQ and GNA11 promoters (encoding for G\u03b1q and G\u03b111) have already been characterized and are both regulated by the transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr-1). In contrast, the PLCB1 promoter (encoding for the direct downstream effector PLC\u03b21) has neither been cloned nor characterized. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1) characterize the PLCB1 promoter, and 2) assess its potential regulation by Egr-1. By means of 5'- Rapid Amplification of 5'-cDNA ends analysis in human heart tissue we found an initiation of transcription from multiple starting points, the main transcription starting point being located at nt-235 relative to the translation start point. The PLCB1 promoter was cloned and deletion constructs were generated. Luciferase assays were performed in three different cell lines and regulatory regions were identified between nt-595/nt-313 (Hek293: P=0.013; HASMC: P=0.019; H9c2: P=0.005). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays one specific Egr-1 binding site was identified at nt-451/-419 and PLCB1 promoter activity was increased more than 5-fold (Hek293: P=0.0008) and 1,6- fold (H9c2: P=0.0499) following overexpression of Egr-1. Thus, the PLCB1 promoter was characterized for the first time and a specific interaction with the transcription factor Egr-1 was shown.

It has been shown that unphosphorylated PLB (U-PLB) inhibits SERCA and that phosphorylation of PLB at Ser-16 or Thr-17 relieves this inhibition in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, the levels of the four phosphorylation states of PLB (U-PLB, P16-PLB, P17-PLB, and doubly phosphorylated 2P-PLB) have not been measured quantitatively in cardiac tissue, and their functional effects on SERCA have not been determined directly. We have solved both problems through the chemical synthesis of all four PLB species. We first used the synthetic PLB as standards for a quantitative immunoblot assay, to determine the concentrations of all four PLB phosphorylation states in pig cardiac tissue, with and without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) induced by aortic banding. In both LVH and sham hearts, all phosphorylation states were significantly populated, but LVH hearts showed a significant decrease in U-PLB, with a corresponding increase in the ratio of total phosphorylated PLB to U-PLB. To determine directly the functional effects of each PLB species, we co-reconstituted each of the synthetic peptides in phospholipid membranes with SERCA and measured calcium-dependent ATPase activity. SERCA inhibition was maximally relieved by P16-PLB (the most highly populated PLB state in cardiac tissue homogenates), followed by 2P-PLB, then P17-PLB. These results show that each PLB phosphorylation state uniquely alters Ca(2+) homeostasis, with important implications for cardiac health, disease, and therapy.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2014-09-06", "authors": ["Naa-Adjeley DAblorh", "XiaoqiongDong", "Zachary MJames", "QiangXiong", "JianyiZhang", "David DThomas", "Christine BKarim"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M114.556621"}

In a control group, rabbits were anesthetized and the four cerebral arteries (the left and right common carotid arteries and vertebral arteries) were occluded for 7.5 min followed by reperfusion. All six rabbits in the control group died. In contrast, a second group underwent perfusion of a cerebral protective solution for 15 min between artery occlusion and reperfusion. All six rabbits in this group survived. However, when the perfusion solution was changed to 5% glucose solution or rabbit plasma in two other groups, the rabbits in both the latter two groups also died. Neuroprotection was also observed when the protective solution was administered for 30-60 min after the onset of artery occlusion and before the return of blood flow (reperfusion). To understand the high rate of thrombotic stroke in the clinic, we assessed the influence of different organ tissue infusions on blood coagulation in vitro and found that blood clotting occurred faster in the presence of brain tissue infusion compared to liver, kidney, and heart tissue infusions. These results indicate a higher rate of thrombosis in brain tissue compared to any of the other tissues tested.

{"title": "Cardiac effects of aldosterone: does gender matter?", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) continues to be the most common cause of death globally, although mortality rates are decreasing with significant advances in treatment. Higher prevalence of co-morbidities in women only partly explains the lack of decrease in mortality rates in younger women due to. Until recently there has been gender bias in pre-clinical studies and many clinical trials, resulting in a significant gap in knowledge whether there are differential responses to therapy for women, particularly younger women. There is increasing evidence that there are significant gender-specific differences in the outcome of post-infarction remodelling, prevalence of hypertension and sudden cardiac death. These differences indicate that cardiac tissue in females displays significant physiological and biochemical differences compared to males. However, the mechanisms mediating these differences, and how they change with age, are poorly understood. Circulating levels and physiological effects of aldosterone vary across the menstrual cycle suggesting female steroid sex hormones may not only regulate production of, but also responses to, aldosterone in pre-menopausal women. This modified tissue response may foster a homeostatic environment where higher levels of aldosterone are tolerated without adverse cardiac effect. Moreover, there is limited data on the direct regulation of this signalling axis by androgens in female animals/subjects. This review explores the relationship between gender and the effects of aldosterone in cardiovascular disease (CVD), an issue of significant need that may lead to changes in best practice to optimise clinical care and improve outcomes for females with CVD.", "journal": "Steroids", "date": "2014-09-01", "authors": ["Anastasia SMihailidou", "Anthony WAshton"], "doi": "10.1016/j.steroids.2014.08.013"}

However, there is currently little data on the expression of SSEAs in human adult cardiac tissue. We obtained right and left atrial biopsies from patients undergoing cardiac surgery. These were dissociated, stained for SSEAs and other cardiac stem cell markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. Directly isolated cells expressed variable levels of SSEA-1, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. The SSEA-1+ population was established as contaminating hematopoietic cells. The SSEA-4+ population, on the other hand, could be subdivided based on the endothelial progenitor marker CD34. The SSEA-4+ CD34- population in the right atrium had a high gene expression of both early (TBX5, NKX2.5) and late (TNNT2) cardiomyocyte markers. The SSEA-4+ CD34+ population, on the other hand, overlapped with previously described C-kit+ CD45- cardiac stem cells. Primary monolayer-cultured cells retained expression of SSEAs while the cardiomyogenic specification in the SSEA-4+ CD34- population was lost. In tissue sections, SSEA-4+ cells could be identified both within and outside the myocardium. Within the myocardium, some SSEA-4+ cells coexpressed cardiomyogenic markers.

P19 cells were 3-dimensionally cultured in hanging drops and P19CL6 cells in a monolayer. Both systems, capable of inducible differentiation towards the cardiomyogenic lineage shown by the appearance of beating cells, the expression of connexin 43 and cardiac troponins T and I, were used to test the cardiomyogenesis-inducing potential of human cardiac-derived adherent proliferating (CardAP) cells, which are candidates for heart repair. CardAP cells in coculture as well as CardAP cell-conditioned medium initiated beating in P19 cells, depending on the cell composition and concentration of the medium. CardAP cell-dependent beating was not observed in P19CL6 cultures, but connexin 43 and cardiac troponin formation as well as expression of GATA-binding protein 4 indicated the dose-dependent stimulatory cardiomyogenic effect of human CardAP cells.

Recently I2KI was used in XCT scans of animal hearts to study cardiac structure and to generate 3D anatomical computer models. However, to date there has been no thorough study into the optimal use of I2KI as a contrast agent in cardiac muscle with respect to the staining times required, which has been shown to impact significantly upon the quality of results. In this study we address this issue by systematically scanning samples at various stages of the staining process. To achieve this, mouse hearts were stained for up to 58 hours and scanned at regular intervals of 6-7 hours throughout this process.

The involvement of IRF9 was assessed via functional assays in a mouse myocardial I/R injury model by genetic knockout and cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of IRF9, and its effects on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation were further studied in vivo and in vitro. IRF9 was upregulated in human ischemic heart tissue and mouse hearts after I/R injury. Ablation of IRF9 protected the heart against I/R-induced cardiomyocyte death, development of inflammation, and loss of heart function. In contrast, cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of IRF9 aggravated myocardial reperfusion injury and inflammation. IRF9 negatively regulated the Sirt1-p53 axis under I/R conditions in vivo and in vitro. Downregulation of Sirt1 expression and its downstream apoptosis-related signaling cascade, which results from I/R, was ameliorated by loss of IRF9 and exacerbated by overexpression of IRF9. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Sirt1 abolished the protective effect of IRF9 knockout against I/R injury, which further indicated that IRF9 mediated myocardial reperfusion injury by modulating the Sirt1-p53 axis.

This article summarizes recent studies that investigate the effect of mechanical cues on the CM differentiation, maturation, and growth. In these studies, CMs derived from embryos, neonates, and mesenchymal stem cells were seeded on different substrates of various elastic modulus. Measuring the contractile function by force production, work output, and calcium handling, it was seen that cell behavior on substrates was optimized when the substrate stiffness mimicked that of the native tissue. The contractile function reflected changes in the sarcomeric protein confirmation and organization that promoted the contractile ability. The analysis of the literature also revealed that, in addition to matrix stiffness, mechanical stimulation, such as stretching the substrate during cell seeding, also played an important role during cell maturation and tissue development.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "L-type Ca2+ channel responses to bay k 8644 in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are unusually dependent on holding potential and charge carrier.", "abstract": "Human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a cellular model for the study of electrophysiology in the human heart and are finding a niche in the field of safety pharmacology for predicting proarrhythmia. The cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel is an important target for some of these safety studies. However, the pharmacology of this channel in these cells is altered compared to native cardiac tissue, specifically in its sensitivity to the Ca2+ channel activator S-(-)-Bay K 8644. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, we examined the effects of S-(-)-Bay K 8644 in three separate stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte cell lines under various conditions in an effort to detect more typical responses to the drug. S-(-)-Bay K 8644 failed to produce characteristically large increases in current when cells were held at -40\u2009mV and Ca2+ was used as the charge carrier, although high-affinity binding and the effects of the antagonist isomer, R-(+)-Bay K 8644, were intact. Dephosphorylation of the channel with acetylcholine failed to restore the sensitivity of the channel to the drug. Only when the holding potential was shifted to a more hyperpolarized (-60\u2009mV) level, and external Ca2+ was replaced by Ba2+, could large increases in current amplitude be observed. Even under these conditions, increases in current amplitude varied dramatically between different cell lines and channel kinetics following drug addition were generally atypical. The results indicate that the pharmacology of S-(-)-Bay K 8644 in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes varies by cell type, is unusually dependent on holding potential and charge carrier, and is different from that observed in primary human heart cells.", "journal": "Assay and drug development technologies", "date": "2014-08-26", "authors": ["JunzhiJi", "JieshengKang", "DavidRampe"], "doi": "10.1089/adt.2014.596"}
{"title": "Improvement of cardiac function by placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells does not require permanent engraftment and is independent of the insulin signaling pathway.", "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). Since MSCs can be obtained from two different regions of the human term placenta (chorionic plate or villi), cells obtained from both these regions were compared so that the best candidate for cell therapy could be selected.\nFor the in vitro studies, chorionic plate MSCs (cp-MSCs) and chorionic villi MSCs (cv-MSCs) were extensively characterized for their genetic stability, clonogenic and differentiation potential, gene expression, and immunophenotype. For the in vivo studies, C57Bl/6 mice were submitted to MI and, after 21 days, received weekly intramyocardial injections of cp-MSCs for 3 weeks. Cells were also stably transduced with a viral construct expressing luciferase, under the control of the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoter, and were used in a bioluminescence assay. The expression of genes associated with the insulin signaling pathway was analyzed in the cardiac tissue from cp-MSCs and placebo groups.\nMorphology, differentiation, immunophenotype, and proliferation were quite similar between these cells. However, cp-MSCs had a greater clonogenic potential and higher expression of genes related to cell cycle progression and genome stability. Therefore, we considered that the chorionic plate was preferable to the chorionic villi for the isolation of MSCs. Sixty days after MI, cell-treated mice had a significant increase in ejection fraction and a reduction in end-systolic volume. This improvement was not caused by a reduction in infarct size. In addition, tracking of cp-MSCs transduced with luciferase revealed that cells remained in the heart for 4 days after the first injection but that the survival period was reduced after the second and third injections. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed similar expression of genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway when comparing cell-treated and placebo groups.\nImprovement of cardiac function by cp-MSCs did not require permanent engraftment and was not mediated by the insulin signaling pathway.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2014-08-26", "authors": ["Juliana APassipieri", "Tais HKasai-Brunswick", "GrazielleSuhett", "Andreza BMartins", "Guilherme VBrasil", "Dilza BCampos", "Nazareth NRocha", "Isalira PRamos", "Debora BMello", "Deivid CRodrigues", "Beatriz BChristie", "Bernardo JSilva-Mendes", "AlexBaldu\u00edno", "Renato MS\u00e1", "Laudelino MLopes", "Regina CGoldenberg", "Antonio CCampos de Carvalho", "Adriana BCarvalho"], "doi": "10.1186/scrt490\n10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01069.x\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.01.010\n10.1007/978-1-60761-999-4_9\n10.1002/jcp.21200\n10.1016/j.placenta.2007.11.006\n10.3109/14653249.2010.547466\n10.1007/978-1-60761-999-4_29\n10.1159/000341254\n10.1097/01.TP.0000144606.84234.49\n10.1634/stemcells.22-5-649\n10.1007/s00441-009-0780-3\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0098\n10.1111/j.1432-0436.2006.00139.x\n10.1093/humrep/den356\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.10.125\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.091\n10.1007/s12015-012-9385-4\n10.3727/096368910X536518\n10.1016/j.ajog.2006.01.101\n10.1634/stemcells.22-4-433\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.04.028\n10.1007/s12010-009-8556-5\n10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07492.x\n10.1002/term.40\n10.1038/477260a\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.suppl_2.II-247\n10.1067/mtc.2000.110250\n10.1038/35070587\n10.1073/pnas.0706406104\n10.1126/science.1074807\n10.1038/nature02446\n10.1038/nature02460\n10.1038/nm0405-367\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.05.016\n10.1007/s12015-011-9282-2\n10.1007/978-0-387-34133-0_4\n10.1152/ajplung.00182.2009\n10.1074/jbc.M609350200\n10.1093/cvr/cvr018\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01455.x\n10.1073/pnas.0504388102\n10.1074/jbc.M112.375014\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.043\n10.1128/MCB.24.6.2487-2498.2004\n10.1161/RES.0b013e3182582523\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1835-10.2010\n10.3109/0886022X.2010.494803\n10.1152/ajpheart.00337.2011\n10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01844.x\n10.1111/xen.12000\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208991\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1007/s10741-010-9165-7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.210682\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.952580\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.010\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.055\n10.1016/j.diff.2012.05.007\n10.1007/s00441-011-1249-8\n10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.03.009\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0521\n10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.022\n10.1016/j.ajog.2009.10.869\n10.1016/j.stem.2007.09.003\n10.1007/s12015-011-9336-5"}
{"title": "Cell-based therapies for cardiac disease: a cellular therapist's perspective.", "abstract": "Cell-based therapy is an exciting, promising, and a developing new treatment for cardiac diseases. Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to fundamentally transform the treatment of ischemic cardiac injury and heart failure by achieving what would have been unthinkable only a few years ago-the Holy Grail of myocardial regeneration. Recent therapeutic approaches involve bone marrow (BM)-derived mononuclear cells and their subsets such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells as well as adipose tissue-derived MSCs, cardiac tissue-derived stem cells, and cell combinations. Clinical trials employing these cells have demonstrated that cellular therapy is feasible and safe. Regarding delivery methods, the safety of catheter-based, transendocardial and -epicardial stem cell injection has been established. However, the results, while variable, suggest rather modest clinical efficacy overall in both heart failure and ischemic heart disease, such as in acute myocardial infarction. Future studies will focus on determining the most efficacious cell type(s) and/or cell combinations and the most reasonable indications and optimal timing of transplantation, as well as the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects. We will review and summarize the clinical trial results to date.

{"title": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus utilizes cell-specific infectious entry mechanisms.", "abstract": "Understanding the entry and trafficking mechanism(s) of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) into host cells can lead to evolution in capsid and vector design and delivery methods, resulting in enhanced transduction and therapeutic gene expression. Variability of findings regarding the early entry pathway of rAAV supports the possibility that rAAV, like other viruses, can utilize more than one infectious entry pathway. We tested whether inhibition of macropinocytosis impacted rAAV transduction of HeLa cells compared to hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. We found that macropinocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin D blocked rAAV transduction of HeLa cells (>2-fold) but enhanced (10-fold) transduction in HepG2 and Huh7 lines. Similar results were obtained with another macropinocytosis inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA). The augmented transduction was due to neither viral binding nor promoter activity, affected multiple rAAV serotypes (rAAV2, rAAV2-R585E, and rAAV8), and influenced single-stranded and self-complementary virions to comparable extents. Follow-up studies using CDC42 inhibitor ML141 and p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) siRNA knockdown also resulted in enhanced HepG2 transduction. Microscopy revealed that macropinocytosis inhibition correlated with expedited nuclear entry of the rAAV virions into HepG2 cells. Enhancement of hepatocellular rAAV transduction extended to the mouse liver in vivo (4-fold enhancement) but inversely blocked heart tissue transduction (13-fold). This evidence of host cell-specific rAAV entry pathways confers a potent means for controlling and enhancing vector delivery and could help unify the divergent accounts of rAAV cellular entry mechanisms.\nThere is a recognized need for improved rAAV vector targeting strategies that result in delivery of fewer total particles, averting untoward toxicity and/or an immune response against the vector. A critical step in rAAV transduction is entry and early trafficking through the host cellular machinery, the mechanisms of which are under continued study. However, should the early entry and trafficking mechanisms of rAAV differ across virus serotype or be dependent on host cell environment, this could expand our ability to target particular cells and tissue for selective transduction. Thus, the observation that inhibiting macropinocytosis leads to cell-specific enhancement or inhibition of rAAV transduction that extends to the organismic level exposes a new means of modulating vector targeting.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2014-08-22", "authors": ["Marc SWeinberg", "SarahNicolson", "Aadra PBhatt", "MichaelMcLendon", "ChengwenLi", "R JudeSamulski"], "doi": "10.1128/JVI.01971-14\n10.2174/156652310793180706\n10.1038/nm1358\n10.1089/hum.2013.065\n10.1056/NEJMoa1108046\n10.1006/mthe.2000.0219\n10.1073/pnas.97.7.3428\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302987\n10.1038/mt.2011.237\n10.1038/nbt.1599\n10.1038/mt.2008.269\n10.1128/JVI.00675-12\n10.1038/mt.2008.100\n10.1038/nprot.2006.93\n10.1038/sj.mt.6300170\n10.1172/JCI8317\n10.1128/JVI.00687-10\n10.1038/sj.gt.3301514\n10.1038/sj.mt.6300355\n10.1128/JVI.74.6.2777-2785.2000\n10.1128/JVI.74.19.9184-9196.2000\n10.1128/JVI.75.4.1824-1833.2001\n10.1016/j.chom.2011.10.014\n10.1128/JVI.01861-12\n10.1128/JVI.00479-10\n10.1099/vir.0.005595-0\n10.1128/JVI.00504-07\n10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01345.x\n10.1128/JVI.02660-13\n10.1038/nprot.2006.207\n10.1038/gt.2011.49\n10.1128/JVI.00935-12\n10.1128/JVI.01340-09\n10.1128/JVI.03443-12\n10.1038/mt.2013.54\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81843-7\n10.1093/emboj/20.1.240\n10.1016/j.tiv.2007.06.017\n10.1128/JVI.77.20.11072-11081.2003\n10.1083/jcb.200908086\n10.1056/NEJM199004263221704\n10.1089/jam.1997.10.147\n10.1002/1099-0496(200007)30:1<25::AID-PPUL5>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1007/s00424-009-0649-z\n10.1159/000083640\n10.1016/0167-4781(94)90124-4\n10.1016/S0223-5234(03)00100-4\n10.1016/0378-4347(96)00158-2\n10.1038/bjc.1993.56\n10.1016/S0378-1119(96)00576-8\n10.1084/jem.186.9.1487\n10.1091/mbc.11.10.3341\n10.1038/emboj.2008.38\n10.1128/JVI.02494-09\n10.1083/jcb.131.1.69"}

{"title": "Congenital heart malformations induced by hemodynamic altering surgical interventions.", "abstract": "Embryonic heart formation results from a dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Blood flow during early embryonic stages plays a critical role in heart development, as interactions between flow and cardiac tissues generate biomechanical forces that modulate cardiac growth and remodeling. Normal hemodynamic conditions are essential for proper cardiac development, while altered blood flow induced by surgical manipulations in animal models result in heart defects similar to those seen in humans with congenital heart disease. This review compares the altered hemodynamics, changes in tissue properties, and cardiac defects reported after common surgical interventions that alter hemodynamics in the early chick embryo, and shows that interventions produce a wide spectrum of cardiac defects. Vitelline vein ligation and left atrial ligation decrease blood pressure and flow; and outflow tract banding increases blood pressure and flow velocities. These three surgical interventions result in many of the same cardiac defects, which indicate that the altered hemodynamics interfere with common looping, septation and valve formation processes that occur after intervention and that shape the four-chambered heart.

{"title": "The disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM10 mediates a canonical Notch-dependent regulation of IL-6 through Dll4 in human endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Although the involvement of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM10 in several areas of vascular biology is now clearly established, its role in vascular inflammation and in Notch signaling at the endothelial level remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that ADAM10 specifically localizes in the CD31(+) endothelial cells (ECs) in normal human cardiac tissues and in cultured primary arterial ECs. In vitro, ADAM10 drives a specific regulation of the Notch pathway in vascular ECs. Using an ADAM10 gain and loss of function approach we show an ADAM10-dependent regulation of Dll1 and Dll4 expression in association with changes in Hes1 and Hey1 expression. We also identified IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and sVCAM-1 as novel targets of ADAM10 upon inflammation. Although Notch pathway does not seem to be required for the production of IL-8, MCP-1 and sVCAM-1, the release of IL-6 by ECs occurred through ADAM10 and a canonical Notch signaling pathway, dependent of \u03b3-secretase activity. Moreover, sustained expression of Dll4 mediated by ADAM10 elicits an increased release of IL-6 suggesting a strong implication of the specific Dll4 signaling in this mechanism. Modulation of IL-6 mediated by ADAM10/Notch signaling required PI3K activity. Thus, our findings suggest that ADAM10/Dll4 signaling is a major signaling pathway in ECs driving inflammatory events involved in inflammation and immune cell recruitment.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2014-08-19", "authors": ["Ang\u00e9liquePabois", "JulieDevalli\u00e8re", "ThibautQuillard", "FloraCoulon", "NathalieG\u00e9rard", "ChristianLaboisse", "ClaireToquet", "B\u00e9atriceCharreau"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2014.08.007"}

The effect of RNAi on \u03b11, 3GT and RelA was examined in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we established a mouse-to-rat heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantatic model (donor hearts transplanted to the right side of the neck in rat) using a modified cuff technique. The survival time of donor hearts in each group was monitored. The expressions of \u03b11, 3GT and RelA mRNA, Gal\u03b11,3Gal antigen, and RelA protein were detected by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot respectively. The expressions of C3, IgM, IgG, NK, macrophages, ICAM-1 on donor hearts were examined by immunohistochemistry.\nHigh titer lentiviral vectors carrying \u03b11, 3GT and RelA shRNA plasmids had a high and stable transfection rate on EOMA in vitro. In vivo, heart tissue showed a much stronger GFP expression and significant decrease in target gene mRNA expression and protein expression in shRNA interfering groups (p < 0.01).

{"title": "Nonlinear behaviour of conduction and block in cardiac tissue with heterogeneous expression of connexin 43.", "abstract": "Altered gap junctional coupling potentiates slow conduction and arrhythmias. To better understand how heterogeneous connexin expression affects conduction at the cellular scale, we investigated conduction in tissue consisting of two cardiomyocyte populations expressing different connexin levels. Conduction was mapped using microelectrode arrays in cultured strands of foetal murine ventricular myocytes with predefined contents of connexin 43 knockout (Cx43KO) cells. Corresponding computer simulations were run in randomly generated two-dimensional tissues mimicking the cellular architecture of the strands. In the cultures, the relationship between conduction velocity (CV) and Cx43KO cell content was nonlinear. CV first decreased significantly when Cx43KO content was increased from 0 to 50%. When the Cx43KO content was \u226560%, CV became comparable to that in 100% Cx43KO strands. Co-culturing Cx43KO and wild-type cells also resulted in significantly more heterogeneous conduction patterns and in frequent conduction blocks. The simulations replicated this behaviour of conduction. For Cx43KO contents of 10-50%, conduction was slowed due to wavefront meandering between Cx43KO cells. For Cx43KO contents \u226560%, clusters of remaining wild-type cells acted as electrical loads that impaired conduction. For Cx43KO contents of 40-60%, conduction exhibited fractal characteristics, was prone to block, and was more sensitive to changes in ion currents compared to homogeneous tissue. In conclusion, conduction velocity and stability behave in a nonlinear manner when cardiomyocytes expressing different connexin amounts are combined. This behaviour results from heterogeneous current-to-load relationships at the cellular level. Such behaviour is likely to be arrhythmogenic in various clinical contexts in which gap junctional coupling is heterogeneous.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2014-08-17", "authors": ["YannPrudat", "Jan PKucera"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.07.019"}

Prophylactic treatment groups, such as high and low dose of GTE and their interactive groups with HCTZ, exhibited significant percentage recovery in terms of heart rate and developed tension. Apart from that, significant increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase, decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive species in heart tissue, as well as significant decrease in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase-MB and N-acetylcysteine levels have also been documented.

Rats in the latter two groups were subjected to 55% total body surface area (TBSA) third-degree burns by immersing the back of the trunk for 15 seconds, both lower extremities for 15 seconds, and the abdomen for 8 seconds in 80 centigrade water. Sham-scald rats were immersed in 37 centigrade water instead. Rats were then subcutaneously injected with VPA (300 mg/kg) or normal saline as control. Blood of 5 rats in each group was with drawn from the abdominal aorta at 6 hours after injury for measurement of plasma creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) activities; then the rats were sacrificed and heart tissues were harvested for the measurement of acetylated histone H3 and activated caspase-3 by Western Blot.

{"title": "Living cardiac tissue slices: an organotypic pseudo two-dimensional model for cardiac biophysics research.", "abstract": "Living cardiac tissue slices, a pseudo two-dimensional (2D) preparation, have received less attention than isolated single cells, cell cultures, or Langendorff-perfused hearts in cardiac biophysics research. This is, in part, due to difficulties associated with sectioning cardiac tissue to obtain live slices. With moderate complexity, native cell-types, and well-preserved cell-cell electrical and mechanical interconnections, cardiac tissue slices have several advantages for studying cardiac electrophysiology. The trans-membrane potential (Vm) has, thus far, mainly been explored using multi-electrode arrays. Here, we combine tissue slices with optical mapping to monitor Vm and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). This combination opens up the possibility of studying the effects of experimental interventions upon action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CaT) dynamics in 2D, and with relatively high spatio-temporal resolution. As an intervention, we conducted proof-of-principle application of stretch. Mechanical stimulation of cardiac preparations is well-established for membrane patches, single cells and whole heart preparations. For cardiac tissue slices, it is possible to apply stretch perpendicular or parallel to the dominant orientation of cells, while keeping the preparation in a constant focal plane for fluorescent imaging of in-slice functional dynamics. Slice-to-slice comparison furthermore allows one to assess transmural differences in ventricular tissue responses to mechanical challenges. We developed and tested application of axial stretch to cardiac tissue slices, using a manually-controlled stretching device, and recorded Vm and [Ca(2+)]i by optical mapping before, during, and after application of stretch. Living cardiac tissue slices, exposed to axial stretch, show an initial shortening in both AP and CaT duration upon stretch application, followed in most cases by a gradual prolongation of AP and CaT duration during stretch maintained for up to 50\u00a0min. After release of sustained stretch, AP duration (APD) and CaT duration reverted to shorter values. Living cardiac tissue slices are a promising experimental model for the study of cardiac mechano-electric interactions. The methodology described here can be refined to achieve more accurate control over stretch amplitude and timing (e.g. using a computer-controlled motorised stage, or by synchronising electrical and mechanical events) and through monitoring of regional tissue deformation (e.g. by adding motion tracking).", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2014-08-16", "authors": ["KenWang", "DerekTerrar", "David JGavaghan", "RazikMu-U-Min", "PeterKohl", "ChristianBollensdorff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2014.08.006"}

Current cardiac imaging techniques (i.e. optical mapping) employ voltage- or calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes to visualize the electrical signal propagation through cardiac syncytium in vitro or in situ with very high-spatiotemporal resolution. The extension of optogenetics into the cardiac field, where cardiac tissue is genetically altered to express light-sensitive ion channels allowing electrical activity to be elicited or suppressed in a precise cell-specific way, has opened the possibility for all-optical interrogation of cardiac electrophysiology. In vivo application of cardiac optogenetics faces multiple challenges and necessitates suitable optical systems employing fiber optics to actuate and sense electrical signals. In this technical perspective, we present a compendium of clinically relevant access routes to different parts of the cardiac electrical conduction system based on currently employed catheter imaging systems and determine the quantitative size constraints for endoscopic cardiac optogenetics.

Since 1998, Dungeness crabs exhibiting pink- to orange-colored joints and opaque white musculature have been sporadically observed in low prevalence from the Fraser River delta of British Columbia, Canada. We provide histological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence that this condition is caused by a new microsporidian parasite. Crabs displaying gross symptoms were confirmed to have heavy infections of ovoid-shaped microsporidian spores (~1.8 \u00d7 1.4 \u00b5m in size) within muscle bundles of the skeletal musculature. The parasite apparently infected the outer periphery of each muscle bundle, and then proliferated into the muscle fibres near the centre of each infected bundle. Light infections were observed in heart tissues, and occasionally spores were observed within the fixed phagocytes lining the blood vessels of the hepatopancreas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple life stages of a monokaryotic microsporidian parasite within the sarcoplasm of muscle fibres. Molecular analysis of partial small subunit rRNA sequence data from the new species revealed an affinity to Ameson, a genus of Microsporidia infecting marine crustaceans. Based on morphological and molecular data, the new species is distinct from Nadelspora canceri, a related microsporidian that also infects the muscles of this host.

The rats were exposed to moxa smoke with concentration of 0%, 10%, 40% and 70%, respectively, for 20 min per day. After continuous intervention for six months, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to measure the level of low density lipoprotein-receptor (LDL-r) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in blood serum in each group; the slices of heart tissue were stained with hematoxylin-eosin staining method to observe morphology change of heart tissue.\n(1) After the intervention of moxa smoke, the levels of LDL-r and ICAM-1 in the low-concentration group were not statistically different from those in the control group (both P > 0.05); the level of LDL-r in the median-concentration group was significantly increased, which was statistically different from that in the control group [(3.87 +/- 0.27) mg/mL vs (2.12 +/- 0.13) mg/mL, P < 0.01], however, the content of ICAM-1 was not obviously changed; although the level of LDL-r in the high-concentration group was presented with an escalating trend, it was not statistically different from that in the control group (P > 0.05) while the level of ICAM-1 was obviously increased (P < 0.01).

The long-time intervention of moderate-concentration moxa smoke could significantly increase the clearance rate of cholesterol, implying the beneficial regulation of moxa smoke on lipid metabolism.

Therefore, we investigated the conditions under which reentrant spiral waves can be generated by high-frequency stimulation at sharp-edged obstacles in the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov (TNNP) ionic model for human cardiac tissue. We show that, in a large range of parameters that account for the conductance of major inward and outward ionic currents of the model [fast inward Na(+) current (INa), L-type slow inward Ca(2+) current (ICaL), slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs), rapid delayed-rectifier current (IKr), inward rectifier K(+) current (IK1)], the critical period necessary for spiral formation is close to the period of a spiral wave rotating in the same tissue. We also show that there is a minimal size of the obstacle for which formation of spirals is possible; this size is \u223c2.5 cm and decreases with a decrease in the excitability of cardiac tissue. We show that other factors, such as the obstacle thickness and direction of wave propagation in relation to the obstacle, are of secondary importance and affect the conditions for spiral wave initiation only slightly. We also perform studies for obstacle shapes derived from experimental measurements of infarction scars and show that the formation of spiral waves there is facilitated by tissue remodeling around it.

In vertebrates, arterial or venous adenosine injection causes a rapid and large bradycardia through atrioventricular node block, a response mediated by adenosine receptors that inhibit adenylate cyclase and decrease cyclic AMP concentration. Chronic developmental hypoxia has been shown to alter cardioregulatory mechanisms in reptile embryos, but adenosine's role in mediating these responses is not known. We incubated snapping turtle embryos under chronic normoxic (N21; 21\u00a0% O2) or chronic hypoxic conditions (H10; 10\u00a0% O2) beginning at 20\u00a0% of embryonic incubation. H10 embryos at 90\u00a0% of incubation were hypotensive relative to N21 embryos in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia caused a hypotensive bradycardia in both N21 and H10 embryos during the initial 30\u00a0min of exposure; however, f H and P m both trended towards increasing during the subsequent 30\u00a0min, and H10 embryos were tachycardic relative to N21 embryos in hypoxia. Following serial \u22651\u00a0h exposure to normoxic and hypoxic conditions, a single injection of adenosine (1\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1)) was given. N21 and H10 embryos responded to adenosine injection with a rapid and large hypotensive bradycardia in both normoxia and hypoxia. Gene expression for adenosine receptors were quantified in cardiac tissue, and Adora1 mRNA was the predominant receptor subtype with transcript levels 30-82-fold higher than Adora2A or Adora2B. At 70\u00a0% of incubation, H10 embryos had lower Adora1 and Adora2B expression compared to N21 embryos. Expression of Adora1 and Adora2B decreased in N21 embryos during development and did not differ from H10 embryos at 90\u00a0% of incubation. Similar to previous results in normoxia, H10 embryos in hypoxia were chronically tachycardic compared to N21 embryos before and after complete cholinergic and adrenergic blockade. Chronic hypoxia altered the development of normal cholinergic and adrenergic tone, as well as adenosine receptor mRNA levels.

Regenerative therapies based on resident cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are a promising alternative to conventional treatments. However, CPCs resident in the heart are quite rare. It is unclear how these CPCs can be isolated and cultured efficiently and what the effects of long-term culture in vitro are on their 'stemness' and differentiation potential, but this is critical knowledge for CPCs' clinical application.\nHere, we isolated stem cell antigen-1 positive cells from postnatal mouse heart by magnetic active cell sorting using an iron-labeled anti-mouse Sca-1 antibody, and cultured them long-term in vitro. We tested stemness marker expression and the proliferation ability of long-term cultured Sca-1+ cells at early, middle and late passages. Furthermore, we determined the differentiation potential of these three passages into cardiac cell lineages (cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle and endothelial cells) after induction in vitro. The expression of myocardial, smooth muscle and endothelial cell-specific genes and surface markers were analyzed by RT-PCR and IF staining. We also investigated the oncogenicity of the three passages by subcutaneously injecting cells in nude mice. Overall, heart-derived Sca-1+ cells showed CPC characteristics: long-term propagation ability in vitro, non-tumorigenic in vivo, persistent expression of stemness and cardiac-specific markers, and multipotent differentiation into cardiac cell lineages.\nOur research may bring new insights to myocardium regeneration, for which even a small number of biopsy-derived CPCs could be enriched and propagated long term in vitro to obtain sufficient seed cells for cell injection or cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "BMC biotechnology", "date": "2014-08-12", "authors": ["HaoWang", "HaoChen", "BeiFeng", "XiangWang", "XiaominHe", "RenjieHu", "MengYin", "WeiWang", "WeiFu", "ZhiweiXu"], "doi": "10.1186/1472-6750-14-75"}

{"title": "Phosphodiesterase 4 interacts with the 5-HT4(b) receptor to regulate cAMP signaling.", "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 and PDE4, which degrade cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), are important regulators of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 4 receptor signaling in cardiac tissue. Therefore, we investigated whether they interact with the 5-HT4(b) receptor, and whether A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), scaffolding proteins that bind to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and contribute to the spacial-temporal control of cAMP signaling, are involved in the regulation of 5-HT4(b) receptor signaling. By measuring PKA activity in the absence and presence of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitiors, we found that constitutive signaling of the overexpressed HA-tagged 5-HT4(b) receptor in HEK293 cells is regulated predominantly by PDE4, with a secondary role for PDE3 that is unmasked in the presence of PDE4 inhibition. Overexpressed PDE4D3 and PDE3A1, and to a smaller extent PDE4D5 co-immunoprecipitate constitutively with the 5-HT4(b) receptor. PDE activity measurements in immunoprecipitates of the 5-HT4(b) receptor confirm the association of PDE4D3 with the receptor and provide evidence that the activity of this PDE may be increased upon receptor stimulation with 5-HT. A possible involvement of AKAPs in 5-HT4(b) receptor signaling was uncovered in experiments using the St-Ht31 inhibitor peptide, which disrupts the interaction of AKAPs with PKA. However, St-Ht31 did not influence 5-HT4(b) receptor-stimulated PKA activity, and endogenous AKAP79 and gravin were not found in immunoprecipitates of the 5-HT4(b) receptor. In conclusion, we found that both PDE3A1 and PDE4D3 are integrated into complexes that contain the 5-HT4(b) receptor and may thereby regulate 5-HT4(b) receptor-mediated signaling.", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2014-08-08", "authors": ["SWeninger", "KVan Craenenbroeck", "R TCameron", "FVandeput", "M AMovsesian", "G SBaillie", "R ALefebvre"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.07.027"}
{"title": "Effects of simulated heat waves on cardiovascular functions in senile mice.", "abstract": "The mechanism of the effects of simulated heat waves on cardiovascular disease in senile mice was investigated. Heat waves were simulated in a TEM1880 meteorological environment simulation chamber, according to a heat wave that occurred in July 2001 in Nanjing, China. Eighteen senile mice were divided into control, heat wave, and heat wave BH4 groups, respectively. Mice in the heat wave and heat wave BH4 groups were exposed to simulated heat waves in the simulation chamber. The levels of ET-1, NO, HSP60, SOD, TNF, sICAM-1, and HIF-1\u03b1 in each group of mice were measured after heat wave simulation. Results show that heat waves decreased SOD activity in the myocardial tissue of senile mice, increased NO, HSP60, TNF, sICAM-1, and HIF-1\u03b1 levels, and slightly decreased ET-1 levels, BH4 can relieve the effects of heat waves on various biological indicators. After a comprehensive analysis of the experiments above, we draw the followings conclusions regarding the influence of heat waves on senile mice: excess HSP60 activated immune cells, and induced endothelial cells and macrophages to secrete large amounts of ICAM-1, TNF-\u03b1, and other inflammatory cytokines, it also activated the inflammation response in the body and damaged the coronary endothelial cell structure, which increased the permeability of blood vessel intima and decreased SOD activity in cardiac tissues. The oxidation of lipoproteins in the blood increased, and large amounts of cholesterol were generated. Cholesterol penetrated the intima and deposited on the blood vessel wall, forming atherosclerosis and leading to the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in senile mice.

{"title": "Dysfunction of the CNS-heart axis in mouse models of Huntington's disease.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodelling and contractile dysfunction occur during both acute and chronic disease processes including the accumulation of insoluble aggregates of misfolded amyloid proteins that are typical features of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease (HD). While HD has been described mainly as a neurological disease, multiple epidemiological studies have shown that HD patients exhibit a high incidence of cardiovascular events leading to heart failure, and that this is the second highest cause of death. Given that huntingtin is ubiquitously expressed, cardiomyocytes may be at risk of an HD-related dysfunction. In mice, the forced expression of an expanded polyQ repeat under the control of a cardiac specific promoter led to severe heart failure followed by reduced lifespan. However the mechanism leading to cardiac dysfunction in the clinical and pre-clinical HD settings remains unknown. To unravel this mechanism, we employed the R6/2 transgenic and HdhQ150 knock-in mouse models of HD. We found that pre-symptomatic animals developed connexin-43 relocation and a significant deregulation of hypertrophic markers and Bdnf transcripts. In the symptomatic animals, pronounced functional changes were visualised by cardiac MRI revealing a contractile dysfunction, which might be a part of dilatated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This was accompanied by the re-expression of foetal genes, apoptotic cardiomyocyte loss and a moderate degree of interstitial fibrosis. To our surprise, we could identify neither mutant HTT aggregates in cardiac tissue nor a HD-specific transcriptional dysregulation, even at the end stage of disease. We postulate that the HD-related cardiomyopathy is caused by altered central autonomic pathways although the pathogenic effects of mutant HTT acting intrinsically in the heart may also be a contributing factor.", "journal": "PLoS genetics", "date": "2014-08-08", "authors": ["MichalMielcarek", "LindaInuabasi", "Marie KBondulich", "ThomasMuller", "Georgina FOsborne", "Sophie AFranklin", "Donna LSmith", "AndreasNeueder", "JimRosinski", "IvanRattray", "AndreaProtti", "Gillian PBates"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1004550"}

After the i.v. administration of salidroside at a dose of 50 mg/kg in rats, salidroside was quantified only in the liver, kidney and heart tissues. The highest level of p-tyrosol was detected in the heart, followed by the spleen, kidney, liver and lungs, in order. Salidroside was detected only in the liver, in contrast, p-tyrosol was detectable in most tissues except the brain, and the kidney tissues contained a significant amount of p-tyrosol compared to the other tissues after the i.g. administration of 100 mg/kg salidroside. The excretion behaviour revealed that the administrated salidroside mainly eliminated in the form of salidroside but not its aglycone metabolite p-tyrosol through urine. After i.v. and i.g. administration in rats, 64.00% and 23.80% of the total dose was excreted through urine in the form of salidroside, respectively.

Preclinical studies have shown that human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells and improve heart function in myocardial infarction. We have developed pharmacologically active microcarriers (PAMs) which are biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric microspheres conveying cells on their biomimetic surface, therefore providing an adequate three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment. Moreover, they can release a growth factor in a prolonged manner. In order to implement ADSCs and PAMs for cardiac tissue engineering we first defined the biomimetic surface by studying the influence of matrix molecules laminin (LM) and fibronectin (FN), in combination with growth factors present in the cardiogenic niche, to further enhance the in vitro cardiac differentiation of ADSCs. We demonstrated that LM increased the expression of cardiac markers (Nkx2.5, GATA4, MEF2C) by ADSCs after 2 weeks in vitro. Interestingly, our results suggest that the 3D support provided by PAMs with a LM biomimetic surface (LM-PAMs) further enhanced the expression of cardiac markers and induced the expression of a more mature contractile protein, cardiac troponin I, compared with the 2D differentiating conditions after only 1 week in culture. The enrichment of the growth-factor cocktail with TGF-\u03b21 potentiated the cardiomyogenic differentiation. These results suggest that PAMs offering a LM biomimetic surface may be efficiently used for applications combining adult stem cells in tissue-engineering strategies of the ischemic heart.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The regulatory subunits of the four PKA isoforms (RI\u03b1, RI\u03b2, RII\u03b1, and RII\u03b2) each form a homodimer, and their dimerization domain interacts with a small helical region present in each of the more than 40 AKAPs reported so far. This allows for tight anchoring of PKA and efficient communication with other signaling proteins that interact with the AKAP scaffold in a spatial and temporal manner. The hydrophobic interaction surfaces of the PKA-R dimer and several AKAP helices have been investigated in great detail. Despite this knowledge, not every suggested AKAP has had its binding motif specified. Here we created an efficient bioinformatic tool, termed THAHIT, to accurately map the PKA binding motif and/or additional motifs of all previously reported AKAPs. Moreover, THAHIT predicts its specificity toward PKA-RI\u03b1 and/or PKA-RII\u03b1 binding. To verify the validity of these newly predicted anchoring sites and their putative specificities, we used computational modeling approaches (HADDOCK), biochemical affinity studies (fluorescence anisotropy), and cellular colocalization studies. We further demonstrate the potential of THAHIT to identify novel AKAPs in cAMP-based chemical proteomics discovery data sets, and the human proteome. We retrieved numerous novel AKAP candidates, including a never reported 330 kDa AKAP observed in heart tissue, which we further characterized biochemically as a PKA-RII\u03b1 binder.

Here we propose an easy method to obtain CS membranes with highly oriented micro-channels for tissue engineering applications, relying on simple control of process parameters and cathodic substrate geometry. Cathodic deposition was performed on two different aluminum grids in galvanostatic conditions at 6.25 mA cm(-2) from CS solution [1g L(-1)] in acetic acid (pH 3.5). Self-standing thin scaffolds were cross linked either with genipin or epichlorohydrin, weighted, and observed by optical and electron microscopy. Swelling properties at pH 5 and pH 7.4 have been also investigated and tensile tests performed on swollen samples at room temperature. Finally, direct and indirect assays have been performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity at 24 and 72 h. Thin scaffolds with two different oriented porosities (1000 \u00b5m and 500 \u00b5m) have been successfully fabricated by electrochemical techniques. Both cross-linking agents did not affected the mechanical properties and cytocompatibility of the resulting structures.

{"title": "Intravital microscopy of localized stem cell delivery using microbubbles and acoustic radiation force.", "abstract": "The use of stem cells for the repair of damaged cardiac tissue after a myocardial infarction holds great promise. However, a common finding in experimental studies is the low number of cells delivered at the area at risk. To improve the delivery, we are currently investigating a novel delivery platform in which stem cells are conjugated with targeted microbubbles, creating echogenic complexes dubbed StemBells. These StemBells vibrate in response to incoming ultrasound waves making them susceptible to acoustic radiation force. The acoustic force can then be employed to propel circulating StemBells from the centerline of the vessel to the wall, facilitating localized stem cell delivery. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of manipulating StemBells acoustically in vivo after injection using a chicken embryo model. Bare stem cells or unsaturated stem cells (<5 bubbles/cell) do not respond to ultrasound application (1 MHz, peak negative acoustical pressure P_ = 200 kPa, 10% duty cycle). However, stem cells which are fully saturated with targeted microbubbles (>30 bubbles/cell) can be propelled toward and arrested at the vessel wall. The mean translational velocities measured are 61 and 177 \u03bcm/s for P- = 200 and 450 kPa, respectively.

Flip was downregulated in transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced animal hearts and cardiomyocytes that had been treated with angiotensin II or phenylephrine for 1\u00a0h. An in vivo, heart hypertrophy model, was performed by TAC in Flip knockdown and sham mice. The extent of hypertrophy of heart was quantitated by echocardiography, and further confirmed by pathological and molecular examination of heart tissue samples. Conditional knockout of Flip in the murine heart increases the hypertrophic response induced by TAC, whereas cardiac function was preserved with reduced Flip levels in response to hypertrophic stimuli.

{"title": "Cardiac fibroblasts support cardiac inflammation in heart failure.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodeling and inflammation are hallmarks of cardiac failure and correlate with outcome in patients. However, the basis for the development of both remains unclear. We have previously reported that cardiac inflammation triggers transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and therefore increase accumulation of cardiac collagen, one key pathology in cardiac remodeling. Hence, identifying key pathways for inflammation would be beneficial for patients suffering from heart failure also. Besides their well-characterized function in matrix regulation, we here investigate the role of fibroblasts in the inflammatory process. We address for the first time the role of fibroblasts as inflammatory supporter cells in heart failure. Using endomyocardial biopsies from patients with heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy, we created a primary human cardiac fibroblast cell culture system. We found that mechanical stretch mimicking cardiac dilation in heart failure induces activation of fibroblasts and not only stimulates production of extracellular matrix but more interestingly up-regulates chemokine production and triggers typical inflammatory pathways in vitro. Moreover, the cell culture supernatant of stretched fibroblasts activates inflammatory cells and induces further recruitment of monocytes by allowing transendothelial migration into the cardiac tissue. Our findings reveal that cardiac fibroblasts provide pro-inflammatory mediators and may act as sentinel cells activated by mechanical stress. Those cells are able to recruit inflammatory cells into the cardiac tissue, a process known to aggravate outcome of patients. This might be important in different forms of heart failure and therefore may be one general mechanism specific for fibroblasts.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2014-08-05", "authors": ["DianaLindner", "ChristinZietsch", "JulianeTank", "SamuelSossalla", "NinaFluschnik", "SvenjaHinrichs", "LarsMaier", "WolfgangPoller", "StefanBlankenberg", "Heinz-PeterSchultheiss", "CarstenTsch\u00f6pe", "DirkWestermann"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-014-0428-7"}

LPS injection caused decreases of heart rate and mean arterial pressure, and elevated serum epinephrine level in C57BL/6 mice.

{"title": "A novel role of exogenous carbon monoxide on protecting cardiac function and improving survival against sepsis via mitochondrial energetic metabolism pathway.", "abstract": "Septic cardiac dysfunction is the main cause of death in septic patients. Here we investigate whether exogenous carbon monoxide can protect cardiac function and improve survival against sepsis by interfering with mitochondrial energetic metabolism. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture to induce sepsis. Exogenous carbon monoxide delivered from Tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (carbon monoxide releasing molecule II, 8 mg/kg) was used intravenously as intervention. We found that carbon monoxide significantly improved cardiac function (LVEF 80.26 \u00b1 2.37% vs. 71.21 \u00b1 1.37%, P < 0.001; LVFS 43.52 \u00b1 1.92% vs. 34.93 \u00b1 1.28%, P < 0.001) and increased survival rate of septic mice (63% vs. 25%, P < 0.01). This phenomenon might be owing to the beneficial effect of carbon monoxide on abolishing the elevation of cardiac enzyme activity, cytokines levels and apoptosis rate, then attenuating cardiac injury in septic mice. Meanwhile, carbon monoxide significantly reversed the loss of mitochondrial number, effectively inhibited cardiac mitochondrial damage in septic mice by modulating glucose uptake, adenosine triphosphate and lactate content. Furthermore upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A genes in cardiac tissue were revealed in septic mice treated with carbon monoxide. Taken together, the results indicate that exogenous carbon monoxide effectively modulated mitochondrial energetic metabolisms by interfering with expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A genes, consequently exerted an important improvement in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "International journal of biological sciences", "date": "2014-08-01", "authors": ["XuWang", "WeitingQin", "XuefengQiu", "JieCao", "DadongLiu", "BingweiSun"], "doi": "10.7150/ijbs.9220"}
{"title": "Adrenal adrenoceptors in heart failure.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a chronic clinical syndrome characterized by the reduction in left ventricular (LV) function and it represents one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite considerable advances in pharmacological treatment, HF represents a severe clinical and social burden. Sympathetic outflow, characterized by increased circulating catecholamines (CA) biosynthesis and secretion, is peculiar in HF and sympatholytic treatments (as \u03b2-blockers) are presently being used for the treatment of this disease. Adrenal gland secretes Epinephrine (80%) and Norepinephrine (20%) in response to acetylcholine stimulation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors on the chromaffin cell membranes. This process is regulated by adrenergic receptors (ARs): \u03b12ARs inhibit CA release through coupling to inhibitory Gi-proteins, and \u03b2 ARs (mainly \u03b22ARs) stimulate CA release through coupling to stimulatory Gs-proteins. All ARs are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and GPCR kinases (GRKs) regulate their signaling and function. Adrenal GRK2-mediated \u03b12AR desensitization and downregulation are increased in HF and seem to be a fundamental regulator of CA secretion from the adrenal gland. Consequently, restoration of adrenal \u03b12AR signaling through the inhibition of GRK2 is a fascinating sympatholytic therapeutic strategy for chronic HF. This strategy could have several significant advantages over existing HF pharmacotherapies minimizing side-effects on extra-cardiac tissues and reducing the chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and endothelin systems. The role of adrenal ARs in regulation of sympathetic hyperactivity opens interesting perspectives in understanding HF pathophysiology and in the identification of new therapeutic targets.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["Claudiode Lucia", "Grazia DFemminella", "GiuseppinaGambino", "GennaroPagano", "ElenaAllocca", "CarloRengo", "CandidaSilvestri", "DarioLeosco", "NicolaFerrara", "GiuseppeRengo"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2014.00246\n10.3317/jraas.2005.006\n10.1196/annals.1296.036\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02043\n10.1016/j.ceca.2012.04.002\n10.1210/me.2003-0035\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000036600.39600.66\n10.1152/ajpheart.01063.2001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300754\n10.1016/j.neuint.2011.12.018\n10.1007/s11886-011-0181-6\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000242642.42177.49\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00378\n10.3233/JAD-121813\n10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02510.x\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.09.026\n10.1161/01.cir.0000441139.02102.80\n10.1016/j.numecd.2007.01.004\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00425.2013\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.08.001\n10.1159/000321211\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282ef9819\n10.1046/j.1365-2826.2001.00628.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000103123.66264.FE\n10.4158/EP.14.9.1137\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00240\n10.1038/nm1553\n10.1074/jbc.M109.077859\n10.1016/j.molmed.2007.10.005\n10.2174/138161212799040510\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300308\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.08.635\n10.1073/pnas.0811706106\n10.1038/sj.mt.6300371\n10.1038/hr.2010.35\n10.1186/1478-811X-9-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1358\n10.1053/ajem.2000.7341\n10.1016/0002-9149(75)90060-0\n10.1016/j.tem.2006.03.008\n10.1177/2047487313491656\n10.1152/ajpheart.00702.2009\n10.1007/s11936-009-0033-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.803999\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.01972.x\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.966895\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.01954.x\n10.1073/pnas.93.18.9954\n10.1186/1532-429X-13-4\n10.3109/00365518809085751\n10.1186/1478-811X-11-64\n10.1038/sj.mp.4000543\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000103160.35395.9E\n10.1007/s00395-011-0166-z\n10.1074/jbc.M000796200\n10.1056/NEJMoa020803\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.11.047\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000014212.04920.62\n10.1078/0171-9335-00250\n10.1007/BF02255947\n10.1210/me.2004-0429\n10.1007/s10557-012-6424-y\n10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013370\n10.1016/0024-3205(80)90513-5\n10.1016/j.abb.2004.01.012\n10.1111/j.1752-8062.2010.00190.x\n10.1038/mt.2008.76\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.16.2118\n10.1093/europace/eum027"}
{"title": "Targeting pleiotropic signaling pathways to control adult cardiac stem cell fate and function.", "abstract": "The identification of different pools of cardiac progenitor cells resident in the adult mammalian heart opened a new era in heart regeneration as a means to restore the loss of functional cardiac tissue and overcome the limited availability of donor organs. Indeed, resident stem cells are believed to participate to tissue homeostasis and renewal in healthy and damaged myocardium although their actual contribution to these processes remain unclear. The poor outcome in terms of cardiac regeneration following tissue damage point out at the need for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling CPC behavior and fate determination before new therapeutic strategies can be developed. The regulation of cardiac resident stem cell fate and function is likely to result from the interplay between pleiotropic signaling pathways as well as tissue- and cell-specific regulators. Such a modular interaction-which has already been described in the nucleus of a number of different cells where transcriptional complexes form to activate specific gene programs-would account for the unique responses of cardiac progenitors to general and tissue-specific stimuli. The study of the molecular determinants involved in cardiac stem/progenitor cell regulatory mechanisms may shed light on the processes of cardiac homeostasis in health and disease and thus provide clues on the actual feasibility of cardiac cell therapy through tissue-specific progenitors.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["StefaniaPagliari", "JakubJelinek", "GabrieleGrassi", "GiancarloForte"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2014.00219\n10.1126/science.286.5447.2153\n10.1016/j.tcb.2012.02.003\n10.1038/sj.gt.3301104\n10.12703/P5-17\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.027\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.274662\n10.1038/nature02460\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223768\n10.1038/nrm1261\n10.1038/376768a0\n10.1210/er.2006-0046\n10.1073/pnas.0808357105\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.06.025\n10.1083/jcb.119.3.629\n10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.039\n10.1083/jcb.200806104\n10.1101/gad.1726608\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0661\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.092627\n10.1242/dev.069377\n10.1242/dev.016865\n10.1172/JCI31731\n10.1083/jcb.200806091\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208629\n10.1084/jem.20081427\n10.1038/ncb1696\n10.1074/jbc.M112.436311\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.05.013\n10.1002/stem.1534\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.842302\n10.1038/nature10137\n10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80247-0\n10.1002/(sici)1097-0177(199909)216:1<45::aid-dvdy7>3.0.co;2-l\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.05.013\n10.1002/stem.1660\n10.1002/path.1717\n10.1016/j.tcm.2008.12.001\n10.1016/B978-0-12-398459-3.00007-1\n10.1089/scd.2012.0277\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0176\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0293\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.6.660\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.221531\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1161/01.RES.0000236754.21499.1c\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.164749\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.016\n10.1126/science.1199010\n10.1038/nrg2279\n10.1126/science.1110955\n10.4161/cc.5.2.2362\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2012.05.004\n10.1083/jcb.148.3.567\n10.1002/jcp.10208\n10.1161/01.cir.0000087444.53354.66\n10.1096/fj.09-151324\n10.1242/dev.071464\n10.1038/nrd4161\n10.3109/07853890.2011.573805\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2316\n10.1073/pnas.1121236109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.203034\n10.1038/ncb1906\n10.1172/JCI119730\n10.1016/j.tcm.2011.11.006\n10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00206-X\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.11.008\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.04.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0058883\n10.1073/pnas.0609100104\n10.1038/nature08602\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81372-0\n10.1038/ng.494\n10.1093/emboj/18.15.4261\n10.1016/j.crvi.2011.03.006\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.734103\n10.1016/j.biocel.2012.02.003\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.174870\n10.4161/jkst.20296\n10.1021/nn4058984\n10.1038/nm1671\n10.1038/nature02446\n10.1073/pnas.0605768103\n10.1161/01.RES.0000226497.52052.2a\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs269\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.02.273\n10.1101/gad.12.13.2048\n10.1002/emmm.201101043\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.893677\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.250282\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.06.012\n10.1038/nature00921\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00758\n10.1056/NEJMoa012081\n10.1016/j.stem.2007.05.018\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.12.009\n10.1007/s00018-011-0633-6\n10.1006/dbio.1994.1169\n10.1038/373699a0\n10.1016/j.mod.2006.05.002\n10.1161/01.RES.0000124394.01180.BE\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06708.x\n10.2741/1868\n10.1016/j.tcm.2007.08.003\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.007\n10.1073/pnas.1000293107\n10.1038/nrc779\n10.1073/pnas.0510138103\n10.1016/j.devcel.2007.06.006\n10.1038/373702a0\n10.1073/pnas.0702859104\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.218487\n10.1161/01.RES.0000183733.53101.11\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.03.007\n10.1073/pnas.1116136109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259960\n10.1083/jcb.131.1.215\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037800\n10.1038/nm1613\n10.1073/pnas.0808393105\n10.1073/pnas.1019603108\n10.1038/onc.2008.123\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-06-0388\n10.1172/JCI45529\n10.1038/nature07060"}
{"title": "Cardiac myocyte-derived follistatin-like 1 prevents renal injury in a subtotal nephrectomy model.", "abstract": "Heart disease contributes to the progression of CKD. Heart tissue produces a number of secreted proteins, also known as cardiokines, which participate in intercellular and intertissue communication. We recently reported that follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1) functions as a cardiokine with cardioprotective properties. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac Fstl1 in renal injury after subtotal nephrectomy. Cardiac-specific Fstl1-deficient (cFstl1-KO) mice and wild-type mice were subjected to subtotal (5/6) nephrectomy. cFstl1-KO mice showed exacerbation of urinary albumin excretion, glomerular hypertrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis after subtotal renal ablation compared with wild-type mice. cFstl1-KO mice also exhibited increased mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, NADPH oxidase components, and fibrotic mediators, in the remnant kidney. Conversely, systemic administration of adenoviral vectors expressing Fstl1 (Ad-Fstl1) to wild-type mice with subtotal nephrectomy led to amelioration of albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, accompanied by reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators, NADPH oxidase components, and fibrotic markers in the remnant kidney. In cultured human mesangial cells, treatment with recombinant FSTL1 attenuated TNF-\u03b1-stimulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Treatment of mesangial cells with FSTL1 augmented the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and inhibition of AMPK activation abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of FSTL1. These data suggest that Fstl1 functions in cardiorenal communication and that the lack of Fstl1 production by myocytes promotes glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage in the kidney.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["SatokoHayakawa", "KojiOhashi", "ReiShibata", "YoshiyukiKataoka", "MegumiMiyabe", "TakashiEnomoto", "YusukeJoki", "YuukiShimizu", "TakahiroKambara", "YusukeUemura", "DaisukeYuasa", "HayatoOgawa", "KazuhiroMatsuo", "MizuhoHiramatsu-Ito", "Maurice J Bvan den Hoff", "KennethWalsh", "ToyoakiMurohara", "NoriyukiOuchi"], "doi": "10.1681/ASN.2014020210"}

Our aim was to identify novel antigens and epitopes by immunoinformatics analysis of the parasite proteome (12 969 proteins) and to validate their immunotherapeutic potential in infected mice. We identified 172 predicted epitopes, using NetMHC and RANKPEP. The corresponding protein sequences were reanalyzed to generate a consensus prediction, and 26 epitopes were selected for in vivo validation. The interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) recall response of splenocytes from T. cruzi-infected mice confirmed that 10 of 26 epitopes (38%) induced IFN-\u03b3 production. The immunotherapeutic potential of a mixture of all 10 peptides was evaluated in infected mice. The therapeutic vaccine was able to control T. cruzi infection, as evidenced by reduced parasitemia, cardiac tissue inflammation, and parasite burden and increased survival.

This protocol refers to neonatal rat heart cells as the cell source; the matrix of choice is fibrin, and the tissues are generated in rectangular agarose-casting molds (12 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm) prepared in standard 24-well cell culture dishes, in which a pair of flexible silicone posts is suspended from above.

Silicone racks holding four pairs of silicone posts each are used to transfer the fresh fibrin cell blocks into new 24-well dishes with culture medium. Without further handling, the cells start to remodel the fibrin gel, form contacts with each other, elongate, and condense the gel to approximately \u00bc of the initial volume.

The magnetic stimulation per se promoted EC organization into capillary-like structures with no supplementation of angiogenic factors; in the non-stimulated constructs, the cells formed sheets or aggregates. This chapter describes in detail the preparation method of the MNP-impregnated alginate scaffold, the cultivation setup for the cell construct under magnetic field conditions, and the set of analyses performed to characterize the resultant cell constructs.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["YuliaSapir", "EmilRuvinov", "BorisPolyak", "SmadarCohen"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-1047-2_8"}

{"title": "Synthesis of aliphatic polyester hydrogel for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Despite clinical advances, ischemic heart disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prolonged cardiac ischemia and loss of cardiomyocytes frequently result in progressive pathological remodeling of the myocardium. If the heart is unable to adapt, patients may succumb to terminal heart failure. Cardiac tissue regeneration combining biodegradable biomaterials and stem cells has emerged as a new approach to restore heart function. Biomaterials, including injectable hydrogels and spongy scaffolds, can facilitate stem cell engraftment and survival and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. Promising early results with injectable, biodegradable hydrogels for cardiac repair have provided new opportunities for designing innovative therapies to treat injured hearts. Hydrogels can be made from natural or synthetic polymers and have a water content, flexibility, and other physiochemical characteristics similar to those of living tissue, which makes them excellent candidates for tissue repair. In addition, hydrogels can be used as a vehicle to deliver cytokines or cells to the heart and can be employed to encapsulate biological macromolecules or cells and release them into the surrounding tissues during degradation. Hydrogels undergo physicochemical modifications in response to changes in temperature or pH, depending upon their polymer composition, converting from a liquid to a gel. The gel form retains cytokine molecules, allows their prolonged, controlled release, and preserves their bioactivity for extended periods. Polyethylene glycol is a water-soluble, biocompatible polymer that has negligible immunogenicity and can produce efficient conjugation of hydrogels to growth factors. In this chapter, we provide insight into the composition, polymerization, and use of a temperature-sensitive, biodegradable, aliphatic polyester hydrogel that transforms to a gel at physiological temperatures and is a potential candidate for cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["SanjivDhingra", "Richard DWeisel", "Ren-KeLi"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-1047-2_5"}

On the other hand, arjunolic acid possesses antioxidant properties and plays protective roles against chemically induced organ pathophysiology. We investigated the effect of sodium nitrite on cardiac tissue in rats on the inflammatory cytokine balance and the type of induced apoptosis, and we analyzed the protective role of arjunolic acid.\nSixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 80mg/kg sodium nitrite in the presence/absence of arjunolic acid (100 and 200mg/kg). Cardiac pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), c-reactive protein (CRP) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were measured by ELISA. Cardiac mitochondrial activity (cytochrome-C-oxidase), JNK activation and apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9) were assessed.\nSodium nitrite resulted in increased TNF-\u03b1 (1.6-fold), IL-1\u03b2 (3.7-fold) and CRP (2.4-fold) levels accompanied by 52%, 59% and 40% reductions in IL-10, IL-4 and cytochrome-C-oxidase, respectively, as well as enhanced JNK, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities.

{"title": "Beta-blocker timolol alleviates hyperglycemia-induced cardiac damage via inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress.", "abstract": "Current data support that pharmacological modulators of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) have therapeutic potential for diabetic individuals. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether timolol, having free radical-scavenger action, besides being a \u03b2-blocker, exerts a cardioprotective effect via inhibition of ERS response in diabetic rats in a comparison with an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Histopathological data showed that either timolol- or NAC-treatment of diabetic rats prevented the changes in mitochondria and nucleus of the cardiac tissue while they enhanced the cellular redox-state in heart as well. The levels of ER-targeted cytoprotective chaperones GRP78 and calnexin, unfolded protein response signaling protein CHO/Gadd153 besides the levels of calpain, BCL-2, phospho-Akt, PUMA, and PML in the hearts from diabetic rats, treated with either timolol or NAC, are found to be similar among these groups, although all these parameters were markedly preserved in the untreated diabetics compared to those of the controls. Taken into consideration how important a balanced-ratio between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins for the maintenance mitochondria/ER function, our results suggest that ERS in diabetic rat heart is mediated by increased oxidative damage, which in turn triggers cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, we also demonstrated that timolol treatment of diabetic rats, similar to NAC treatment, induced a well-controlled redox-state and apoptosis in cardiac myocardium. We, thus for the first time, report that cardioprotective effect of timolol seems to be associated with normalization of ER function due to its antioxidant action in cardiomyocytes even under hyperglycemia.", "journal": "Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["Figen AmberCicek", "AysegulToy", "ErkanTuncay", "BelginCan", "BelmaTuran"], "doi": "10.1007/s10863-014-9568-6"}

In this study, the effect of XJEK on cardiovascular system was investigated. To test the hypothesis that Xin-Ji-Er-Kang (XJEK) has an anti-hypertensive effect mediated through attenuation of cardiac remodeling, and amelioration of vascular endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress.\nHypertension was induced in Wistar rats by 2 kidney 1 clip (2K1C) treatment. The hypertensive rats were then randomly assigned into four groups and treated as follows: group 1 (Sham-operated [Sh-Op] group received only drinking water), group 2 (induced hypertensive model+no treatment), and group 3 (induced hypertensive+a single daily oral dose of 24 g kg(-1) XJEK treatment) and group 4 (induced hypertensive+a single oral dose of 15 mg kg(-1) Fosinopril treatment). The rats in all the defined groups were respectively treated for a period of 4 weeks. Cardiovascular parameter such as systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured weekly by using tail-cuff apparatus; left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and the rate of the rise in left ventricular pressure (\u00b1dp/dt max) were measured by using a PowerLab 8/30 apparatus (AD Instruments, Australia) at the end of the 8th week; heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) was determined as an index of myocardial hypertrophy (MH). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Van Gieson (VG) stain were used to assess the cardio-histological changes. Colorimetric analysis was used to assay serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents in cardiac tissue. Angiotensin II (Ang II) content in serum was assessed by radioimmunoassay; tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) content in cardiac tissue, BNP and endothelial NOS (eNOS) in serum were determined by using ELISA, and the protein expressions of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), P-JNK, p38, P-p38, and NADPH oxidases-2 (Nox-2) were measured by western blot.\nXJEK therapy could impair the heart systolic and diastolic function, potently improve the heart weight index, inhibit the elevation of HW/BW ratio, and markedly ameliorate hemodynamic indices and vascular remodeling index. It has blunted the decrease of SOD, NO and the increase in MDA and Ang II serum contents, myocardial cross-section area (CSA), collagen volume fraction (CVF) and perivascular circumferential collagen area (PVCA) compared to the hypertensive model group. It also reduced the serum content of Hyp while increased BH4 levels in cardiac tissue. In addition, the expressions of Nox-2, P-JNK and P-p38MAPK were all suppressed compared to the hypertensive model group. Moreover, treatment with XJEK improved endothelial dysfunction (ED) manifested by promoting eNOS activities and enhancing the NO activity in serum.\nThe results of the present study show that XJEK attenuates 2K1C-induced hypertension in rats, which confirms our hypothesis that XJEK has an anti-hypertensive and cardiovascular remodeling effect via attenuation of cardiac remodeling and improvement of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2014-07-27", "authors": ["KunGuo", "Chao-zongLan", "Ting-tingYu", "Ling-lingHuang", "Xing-huiWang", "ChenPan", "ShanGao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2014.07.006"}

Changes in both creatine kinase activity and creatine concentration showed a similar trend to zebrafish activity. There was no obvious change in SV-BA after DKA exposure, while a reduction of heart rate was concomitant with increasing DKA concentrations.

PBDEs may interfere with thyroid hormone (TH) during development, which could produce neurobehavioral deficits. An assumption in experimental and epidemiological studies is that PBDE effects on serum TH levels will reflect PBDE effects on TH action in tissues. To test whether this assumption is correct, we performed the following experiments. First, five concentrations of diphenyl ether (0-30 mg/kg) were fed daily to pregnant rats to postnatal day 21. PBDEs were measured in dam liver and heart to estimate internal dose. The results were compared with a separate study in which four concentrations of propylthiouracil (PTU; 0, 1, 2, and 3 ppm) was provided to pregnant rats in drinking water for the same duration as for diphenyl ether. PBDE exposure reduced serum T4 similar in magnitude to PTU, but serum TSH was not elevated by PBDE. PBDE treatment did not affect the expression of TH response genes in the liver or heart as did PTU treatment. PTU treatment reduced T4 in liver and heart, but PBDE treatment reduced T4 only in the heart. Tissue PBDEs were in the micrograms per gram lipid range, only slightly higher than observed in human fetal tissues. Thus, PBDE exposure reduces serum T4 but does not produce effects on tissues typical of low TH produced by PTU, demonstrating that the effects of chemical exposure on serum T4 levels may not always be a faithful proxy measure of chemical effects on the ability of thyroid hormone to regulate development and adult physiology.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2014-07-26", "authors": ["RubyBansal", "DanielTighe", "AminDanai", "Dorothea F KRawn", "Dean WGaertner", "Doug LArnold", "Mary EGilbert", "R ThomasZoeller"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2014-1154"}

In this study, we examined whether RSVL has protective effects against DOX\u2011induced free radical production and cardiotoxicity in male rats. The tested dose of DOX (20 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in the serum activities of the cardiac enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the heart tissue. However, there was a significant decrease in the glutathione level in the heart tissue. Simultaneous treatment of rats with RSVL [10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection] reduced the activity of LDH and CPK and significantly reduced MDA production in the heart. The total antioxidant capacity was increased following RSVL administration. Electron microscopy examination of the heart tissue showed that DOX treatment results in massive fragmentation and lysis of the myofibrils, and that mitochondria show either vacuolization or complete loss of the cristae.

Left ventricular fibrosis and capillary density were quantified in post-mortem samples. Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was assessed by immunostaining of post-mortem samples and RNA expression in heart tissue obtained during cardiac surgery. Circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), endostatin (END), angiopoietin-2 (ANG), and thrombospondin-2 (TSP) were measured, and the effect of these factors and of subject serum on proliferation, apoptosis, and EndMT of HCAEC was analyzed.\nCardiac fibrosis increased 12% and 77% in stage 3-4 CKD and ESRD and microvascular density decreased 12% and 16% vs. preserved renal function. EndMT-derived fibroblast proportion was 17% higher in stage 3-4 CKD and ESRD (P trend = 0.02). ADMA, ANG, TSP, and END concentrations increased in CKD. Both individual factors and CKD serum increased HCAEC apoptosis (P=0.02), decreased proliferation (P=0.03), and induced EndMT.\nCKD is associated with an increase in circulating angiogenesis and NO inhibitors, which impact proliferation and apoptosis of cardiac endothelial cells and promote EndMT, leading to cardiac fibrosis and capillary rarefaction. These processes may play key roles in CKD-associated CV disease.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2014-07-23", "authors": ["David MCharytan", "RobertPadera", "Alexander MHelfand", "MichaelZeisberg", "XingboXu", "XiaopengLiu", "JonathanHimmelfarb", "AngelesCinelli", "RaghuKalluri", "Elisabeth MZeisberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.06.062"}

We have developed a therapeutic materials strategy that aims to mitigate myocardial fibrosis by utilizing injectable polymeric microstructures to mechanically alter the microenvironment. Polymeric microstructures were fabricated using photolithographic techniques and studied in a three-dimensional culture model of the fibrotic environment and by direct injection into the infarct zone of adult rats. Here, we show dose-dependent down-regulation of expression of genes associated with the mechanical fibrotic response in the presence of microstructures.

Expression of PRR is increased in the heart and kidney of hypertensive and diabetic animals, but its causative role in organ damage is still unclear. To determine whether increased expression of PRR is sufficient to induce cardiac or renal injury, we generated a mouse that constitutively overexpresses PRR by knocking-in the Atp6ap2/PRR gene in the hprt locus under the control of a CMV immediate early enhancer/chicken beta-actin promoter. Mice were backcrossed in the C57Bl/6 and FVB/N strain and studied at the age of 12 months. In spite of a 25- to 80-fold renal and up to 400-fold cardiac increase in Atp6ap2/PRR expression, we found no differences in systolic blood pressure or albuminuria between wild-type and PRR overexpressing littermates. Histological examination did not show any renal or cardiac fibrosis in mutant mice. This was supported by real-time PCR analysis of inflammatory markers as well as of pro-fibrotic genes in the kidney and collagen in cardiac tissue. To determine whether the concomitant increase of renin would trigger fibrosis, we treated PRR overexpressing mice with the angiotensin receptor-1 blocker losartan over a period of 6 weeks. Renin expression increased eightfold in the kidney but no renal injury could be detected. In conclusion, our results suggest no major role for PRR in organ damage per se or related to its function as a receptor of renin.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2014-07-22", "authors": ["AlvaRosendahl", "GianinaNiemann", "SaschaLange", "ErfanAhadzadeh", "ChristianKrebs", "AurelieContrepas", "Harryvan Goor", "ThorstenWiech", "MichaelBader", "MichaelSchwake", "JudithPeters", "RolfStahl", "Genevi\u00e8veNguyen", "Ulrich OWenzel"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2014.83"}

The human heart geometry used for simulations was obtained from three-dimensional, high resolution CT-angio scans. Two fluid flow domains for the right (pulmonic) and left (systemic) heart circulations, and two solid domains for the heart tissue and gelatin solution were defined for multi-domain numerical simulation. Detailed unsteady temperature fields within the heart tissue were calculated during the conjugate cooling process. A linear thermoelasticity analysis was performed to assess the stresses applied on the heart due to the coolant fluid shear and normal forces and to examine the thermal stress caused by temperature variation inside the heart. It was demonstrated that a conjugate cooling effort with coolant temperature at +4\u00b0C is capable of reducing the average heart temperature from +37\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C in 25 minutes for cases in which the coolant was steadily pumped only through major heart inlet veins and cavities.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2014-07-22", "authors": ["AbasAbdoli", "George SDulikravich", "ChandrajitBajaj", "David FStowe", "M SalikJahania"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.2662"}

However, the influence of IL-17 on IL-27 expression in murine model of VMC remains unknown.\nWild-type (WT) and IL-17A-deficient (IL-17A(-/-)) mice on the BALB/c background were intraperitoneally (i.p) injected with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) for establishing VMC models. Cardiac tissue was obtained on day 7 after CVB3 injection. Myocardial histopathologic changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained myocardial sections.Expression of IL-27 in heart and serum was measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Furthermore, splenic lymphocytes and peritoneal macrophages were purified 1 week after injection from WT mice.Isolated lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of different concentrations (0 and 25 ng/ml) of recombinant IL-17 (rIL-17) for 24 h. Macrophages were cultured with different concentrations of rIL-17 (0 and 10 ng/ml) for 48 h.IL-27 mRNA expression of cultured cells was assayed by RT-PCR, and their protein level in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA.\nCompared with WT mice, significantly less cardiac inflammation was evidenced in the heart of IL-17A-/- mice (0.9 \u00b1 0.3 vs.1.9 \u00b1 0.5) , relative cardiac IL-27 p28 mRNA expressions (1.11 \u00b1 0.24 vs.3.1 \u00b1 0.8) and serum IL-27 protein[(72 \u00b1 18) pg/ml vs.(95 \u00b1 25) pg/ml] were also significantly lower in IL-17A-/- mice (all P < 0.05).In the culture lymphocytes, the relative mRNA (1.02 \u00b1 0.13 vs.1.32 \u00b1 0.21) and protein [(49 \u00b1 9) pg/ml vs.(52 \u00b1 11) pg/ml]expressions of IL-27 p28 and were similar post treatment with 0 and 25 ng/ml rIL-17 (all P > 0.05).

We illustrate the use of dSTORM based super-resolution in optically thick (\u223c10\u00a0\u03bcm) tissue slices of rat ventricular tissue to visualize proteins at the cardiac Z-disk and compare those images with confocal (diffraction-limited) as well as electron microscopy (EM) data which still provides a benchmark in terms of resolution. \u03b1-actinin is an abundant protein target that effectively defines the Z-disk in striated muscle and provides a reference structure for other proteins at the Z-line and the transverse tubules. Using super-resolution imaging \u03b1-actinin labelling provides very detailed outlines of the contractile machinery which we have used to study the properties of Z-disks and the distribution of \u03b1-actinin itself. We determined the local diameters of the myo-fibrillar and non-myofibrillar space using \u03b1-actinin labelling. Comparison between confocal and super-resolution based myofibrillar masks suggested that super-resolution data was able to segment myofibrils accurately while confocal approaches were not always able to distinguish neighbouring myofibrillar bundles which resulted in overestimated diameters. The increased resolution of super-resolution methods provides qualitatively new information to improve our understanding of cardiac biophysics.

{"title": "Cardiac applications of optogenetics.", "abstract": "In complex multicellular systems, such as the brain or the heart, the ability to selectively perturb and observe the response of individual components at the cellular level and with millisecond resolution in time, is essential for mechanistic understanding of function. Optogenetics uses genetic encoding of light sensitivity (by the expression of microbial opsins) to provide such capabilities for manipulation, recording, and control by light with cell specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. As an optical approach, it is inherently scalable for remote and parallel interrogation of biological function at the tissue level; with implantable miniaturized devices, the technique is uniquely suitable for in\u00a0vivo tracking of function, as illustrated by numerous applications in the brain. Its expansion into the cardiac area has been slow. Here, using examples from published research and original data, we focus on optogenetics applications to cardiac electrophysiology, specifically dealing with the ability to manipulate membrane voltage by light with implications for cardiac pacing, cardioversion, cell communication, and arrhythmia research, in general. We discuss gene and cell delivery methods of inscribing light sensitivity in cardiac tissue, functionality of the light-sensitive ion channels within different types of cardiac cells, utility in probing electrical coupling between different cell types, approaches and design solutions to all-optical electrophysiology by the combination of optogenetic sensors and actuators, and specific challenges in moving towards in\u00a0vivo cardiac optogenetics.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2014-07-19", "authors": ["Christina MAmbrosi", "AleksandraKlimas", "JinzhuYu", "EmiliaEntcheva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2014.07.001"}

{"title": "HDAC class I inhibitor, Mocetinostat, reverses cardiac fibrosis in heart failure and diminishes CD90+ cardiac myofibroblast activation.", "abstract": "Interstitial fibrosis and fibrotic scar formation contribute to cardiac remodeling and loss of cardiac function in myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure. Recent studies showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors retard fibrosis formation in acute MI settings. However, it is unknown whether HDAC inhibition can reverse cardiac fibrosis in ischemic heart failure. In addition, specific HDAC isoforms involved in cardiac fibrosis and myofibroblast activation are not well defined. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of selective class I HDAC inhibition on cardiac fibroblasts activation and cardiac fibrosis in a congestive heart failure (CHF) model secondary to MI.\nMI was created by left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion. Class I HDACs were selectively inhibited via Mocetinostat in CD90+ fibroblasts isolated from atrial and ventricular heart tissue in vitro. In vivo, Class I HDACs were inhibited in 3\u00a0weeks post MI rats by injecting Mocetinostat for the duration of 3\u00a0weeks. Cardiac function and heart tissue were analyzed at 6\u00a0weeks post MI.\nIn sham hearts, HDAC1 and HDAC2 displayed differential expression patterns where HDAC1 mainly expressed in cardiac fibroblast and HDAC2 in cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, we showed that HDAC1 and 2 were upregulated in CHF hearts, and were found to co-localize with CD90+ cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo treatment of CHF animals with Mocetinostat improved left ventricle end diastolic pressure and dp/dt max and decreased the total collagen amount. In vitro treatment of CD90+ cells with Mocetinostat reversed myofibroblast phenotype as indicated by a decrease in \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), Collagen III, and Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2). Furthermore, Mocetinostat increased E-cadherin, induced \u03b2-catenin localization to the membrane, and reduced Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling in atrial cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, Mocetinostat treatment of atrial CD90+ cells upregulated cleaved-Caspase3 and activated the p53/p21 axis.\nTaken together, our results demonstrate upregulation of HDAC1 and 2 in CHF.

However, human cardiac tissues are difficult to procure in sufficient enough quantities for studying the mechanisms of cardiac-specific viral infection.\nThis study examined whether human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) could be used to model the pathogenic processes of coxsackievirus-induced viral myocarditis and to screen antiviral therapeutics for efficacy.\nhiPSC-CMs were infected with a luciferase-expressing coxsackievirus B3 strain (CVB3-Luc). Brightfield microscopy, immunofluorescence, and calcium imaging were used to characterize virally infected hiPSC-CMs for alterations in cellular morphology and calcium handling. Viral proliferation in hiPSC-CMs was quantified using bioluminescence imaging. Antiviral compounds including interferon\u03b21, ribavirin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and fluoxetine were tested for their capacity to abrogate CVB3-Luc proliferation in hiPSC-CMs in vitro. The ability of these compounds to reduce CVB3-Luc proliferation in hiPSC-CMs was consistent with reported drug effects in previous studies. Mechanistic analyses via gene expression profiling of hiPSC-CMs infected with CVB3-Luc revealed an activation of viral RNA and protein clearance pathways after interferon\u03b21 treatment.\nThis study demonstrates that hiPSC-CMs express the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, are susceptible to coxsackievirus infection, and can be used to predict antiviral drug efficacy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potential markers and targets for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, respectively. We determined myocardial and circulating miRNA abundance and its changes in patients with stable and end-stage HF before and at different time points after mechanical unloading by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) by small RNA sequencing. miRNA changes in failing heart tissues partially resembled that of fetal myocardium. Consistent with prototypical miRNA-target-mRNA interactions, target mRNA levels were negatively correlated with changes in abundance for highly expressed miRNAs in HF and fetal hearts. The circulating small RNA profile was dominated by miRNAs, and fragments of tRNAs and small cytoplasmic RNAs. Heart- and muscle-specific circulating miRNAs (myomirs) increased up to 140-fold in advanced HF, which coincided with a similar increase in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) protein, the established marker for heart injury. These extracellular changes nearly completely reversed 3 mo following initiation of LVAD support. In stable HF, circulating miRNAs showed less than fivefold differences compared with normal, and myomir and cTnI levels were only captured near the detection limit. These findings provide the underpinning for miRNA-based therapies and emphasize the usefulness of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for heart injury performing similar to established diagnostic protein biomarkers.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-07-12", "authors": ["Kemal MarcAkat", "D'VesharronneMoore-McGriff", "PavelMorozov", "MiguelBrown", "TasosGogakos", "JoelCorrea Da Rosa", "AleksandraMihailovic", "MarkusSauer", "RuipingJi", "AarthiRamarathnam", "HanaTotary-Jain", "ZevWilliams", "ThomasTuschl", "P ChristianSchulze"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1401724111"}

The aim was to investigate cardiac lesions following diabetes induction, and the potential effect of GLP-1 on this type of lesions and the molecular mechanism driving this activity. Adult male rats were classified into: normal, diabetic, 4-week high-dose exenatide-treated diabetic rats, 4-week low-dose exenatide-treated diabetic rats, and 1-week exenatide-treated diabetic rats. The following parameters were measured: in blood: glucose, insulin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), and CK-MB relative index; in cardiac tissue: lipid peroxide (LPO) and some antioxidant enzymes. The untreated diabetic group displayed significant increases in blood level of glucose, LDH, and CK-MB, and cardiac tissue LPO, and a significant decrease in cardiac tissue antioxidant enzymes. GLP-1 supplementation in diabetic rats definitely decreased the hyperglycemia and abolished the detrimental effects of diabetes on the cardiac tissue. The effect of GLP-1 on blood glucose and on the heart also appeared after a short supplementation period (1\u00a0week).

{"title": "AKAP150 mobilizes cPKC-dependent cardiac glucotoxicity.", "abstract": "Activation of conventional PKCs (cPKC) is a key signaling that directs the cardiac toxicity of hyperglycemia. AKAP150, a scaffold protein of the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) family, is less defined regarding its capability to anchor and regulate cardiac cPKC signaling. This study was designed to investigate the role of AKAP150 in cPKC-mediated cardiac glucotoxicity. In cardiac tissues from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and high-glucose-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, both mRNA and protein levels of AKAP150 increased significantly, and marked elevations were observed in cPKC activity and both expression and phosphorylation levels of p65 NF-\u03baB and p47(phox). AKAP150 knockdown was established via intramyocardial injection in vivo and transfection in vitro of adenovirus carrying AKAP150-targeted shRNA. Downregulation of AKAP150 reversed diabetes-induced diastolic dysfunction as manifested by decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and early/late mitral diastolic wave ratio. AKAP150 inhibition also abrogated high-glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (TUNEL staining and annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry) and oxidative stress (ROS production, NADPH oxidase activity, and lipid peroxidation). More importantly, reduced AKAP150 expression significantly inhibited high-glucose-induced membrane translocation and activation of cPKC and suppressed the increases in the phosphorylation of p65 NF-\u03baB and p47(phox). Immunofluorescent coexpression and immunoprecipitation indicated enhanced anchoring of AKAP150 with cPKC within the plasma membrane under hyperglycemia, and AKAP150 preferentially colocalized and functionally bound with PKC\u03b1 and -\u03b2 isoforms. These results suggest that cardiac AKAP150 positively responds to hyperglycemia and enhances the efficiency of glucotoxicity signaling through a cPKC/p47(phox)/ROS pathway that induces myocardial dysfunction, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and oxidative stress.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We here propose to integrate human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and pharmacologically active microcarriers (PAMs), a three-dimensional (3D) carrier of cells and growth factors, into an injectable hydrogel (HG), to obtain a system that stimulates the survival and/or differentiation of the grafted cells toward a cardiac phenotype. PAMs are biodegradable and non-cytotoxic poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres conveying cells on their 3D surface that deliver continuously and in a controlled manner a growth factor (GF) acting on the transported cells and on the microenvironment to improve engraftment. The choice of the appropriate GF and its protection during the formulation process and delivery are essential. In this study two GFs, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), have been encapsulated under a solid state in order to limit their interaction with the polymer and conserve their integrity. GF precipitation conditions and release profile from PAMs have been first investigated before combining them to ADSCs. The released IGF-1 and HGF induced the protein synthesis of cardiac differentiation markers GATA4, Nkx2.5, cTnI and CX43 after 1week in vitro. Moreover, the GFs accelerated cell cycle progression, as suggested by the increased expression of Cyclin D1 mRNA and the widespread distribution of Ki67 protein. Integrating PAMs within the thermosensitive P407 hydrogel increased their elastic properties but decreased the transcription of most cardiac markers. In contrast, CX43 expression increased in ADSC-PAM-GF complexes embedded within the hydrogel compared to the ADSCs cultured alone in the absence of P407. These results suggest that particulate scaffolds releasing HGF and IGF-1 may be beneficial for applications in tissue-engineering strategies for myocardial repair and the association with a P407 hydrogel can increase substrate elasticity and junction connections in ADSCs.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2014-07-08", "authors": ["Jean-PierreKaram", "ClaudioMuscari", "LaurenceSindji", "GuillaumeBastiat", "FrancescaBonaf\u00e8", "Marie-ClaireVenier-Julienne", "N ClaudiaMontero-Menei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.06.052"}

The accumulated evidence in 2014 indicates, however, that the therapeutic success of these cells is modest and the tissue regeneration involves much more complex processes than cell-related biologics. As the quest for the ideal cell or combination of cells continues, alternative cell types, such as resident cardiac cells, adipose-derived or phenotypic modified stem or progenitor cells have also been applied, with the objective of increasing both the number and the retention of the reparative cells in the myocardium. Two main delivery routes (intracoronary and percutaneous intramyocardial) of stem cells are currently used preferably for patients with recent acute myocardial infarction or ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other delivery modes, such as surgical or intravenous via peripheral veins or coronary sinus have also been utilized with less success. Due to the difficult recruitment of patients within conceivable timeframe into cardiac regenerative trials, meta-analyses of human cardiac cell-based studies have tried to gather sufficient number of subjects to present a statistical compelling statement, reporting modest success with a mean increase of 0.9-6.1% in left ventricular global ejection fraction.

All three IFN plasmids induced expression of antiviral genes (Mx, Viperin, ISG15 and IFIT5) at the muscle injection site while the control plasmid had little effect. Only IFNb and IFNc plasmids induced expression of antiviral genes in head kidney, liver and heart. This suggests that IFNb and IFNc are distributed systemically while IFNa1 is active only at the injection site. Injection of IFNc plasmid was found to induce expression of antiviral genes and receptors for virus RNA (RIG-I, TLR3 and TLR7) in head kidney from 1 to at least 8 weeks. Immunoblotting showed increased expression of ISG15 and Mx protein in liver with time during this time period. Challenge of presmolts with ISAV 8 weeks after injection of IFN plasmids, showed strong protection of the IFNc plasmid injected fish, low protection of the IFNb plasmid injected fish and no protection of the IFNa1 plasmid injected fish. Clues to the difference in protection obtained with IFNb and IFNc plasmids were found by immunohistochemical and immunoblot studies of Mx protein, which indicated that IFNc plasmid stimulated stronger Mx protein expression in heart tissues and liver endothelial cells than IFNb plasmid.

Along with the idea to develop nanocarriers that efficiently deliver therapeutic agents to target the heart, in this study, we aimed to test the in vivo biocompatibility of different sizes of thermally hydrocarbonized porous silicon (THCPSi) microparticles and thermally oxidized porous silicon (TOPSi) micro and nanoparticles in the heart tissue. Despite the absence or low cytotoxicity, both particle types showed good in vivo biocompatibility, with no influence on hematological parameters and no considerable changes in cardiac function before and after MI. The local injection of THCPSi microparticles into the myocardium led to significant higher activation of inflammatory cytokine and fibrosis promoting genes compared to TOPSi micro and nanoparticles; however, both particles showed no significant effect on myocardial fibrosis at one week post-injection. Our results suggest that THCPSi and TOPSi micro and nanoparticles could be applied for cardiac delivery of therapeutic agents in the future, and the PSi biomaterials might serve as a promising platform for the specific treatment of heart diseases.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-07-06", "authors": ["Marja AT\u00f6lli", "M\u00f3nica P AFerreira", "Sini MKinnunen", "JaanaRys\u00e4", "Ermei MM\u00e4kil\u00e4", "Zolt\u00e1nSzab\u00f3", "Raisa ESerpi", "Pauli JOhukainen", "Mika JV\u00e4lim\u00e4ki", "Alexandra M RCorreia", "Jarno JSalonen", "Jouni THirvonen", "Heikki JRuskoaho", "H\u00e9lder ASantos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.078"}

Focusing on energy production and cardiac contraction, we analyzed microarray data from heart tissue obtained in groups of mice and rats in normal conditions and with a left ventricular dysfunction. In each group and for each function, we identified genes positively or negatively correlated with numerous genes of the function, which were called coordinated or inversely coordinated with the function. The genes coordinated with energy production or cardiac contraction showed the coupling of these functions in all groups. Among coordinated or inversely coordinated genes common to the two functions, we proposed a fair number of transcriptional regulators as potential determinants of the energy production and cardiac contraction coupling. Although this coupling was constant across the groups and unveiled a stable gene core, the combinations of transcriptional regulators were very different between the groups, including one half that has never been linked to heart function. These results highlighted the stable coordination of energy production or cardiac contraction at the mRNA level, and the combinatorial and versatile nature of potential transcriptional regulation.

{"title": "Red blood cells serve as intravascular carriers of myeloperoxidase.", "abstract": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme enzyme abundantly expressed in polymorphonuclear neutrophils. MPO is enzymatically capable of catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the consumption of nitric oxide (NO). Thus MPO has both potent microbicidal and, upon binding to the vessel wall, pro-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, MPO - a highly cationic protein - has been shown to bind to both endothelial cells and leukocyte membranes. Given the anionic surface charge of red blood cells, we investigated binding of MPO to erythrocytes. Red blood cells (RBCs) derived from patients with elevated MPO plasma levels showed significantly higher amounts of MPO by flow cytometry and ELISA than healthy controls. Heparin-induced MPO-release from patient-derived RBCs was significantly increased compared to controls. Ex vivo experiments revealed dose and time dependency for MPO-RBC binding, and immunofluorescence staining as well as confocal microscopy localized MPO-RBC interaction to the erythrocyte plasma membrane. NO-consumption by RBC-membrane fragments (erythrocyte \"ghosts\") increased with incrementally greater concentrations of MPO during incubation, indicating preserved catalytic MPO activity. In vivo infusion of MPO-loaded RBCs into C57BL/6J mice increased local MPO tissue concentrations in liver, spleen, lung, and heart tissue as well as within the cardiac vasculature. Further, NO-dependent relaxation of aortic rings was altered by RBC bound-MPO and systemic vascular resistance significantly increased after infusion of MPO-loaded RBCs into mice. In summary, we find that MPO binds to RBC membranes in vitro and in vivo, is transported by RBCs to remote sites in mice, and affects endothelial function as well as systemic vascular resistance. RBCs may avidly bind circulating MPO, and act as carriers of this leukocyte-derived enzyme.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2014-07-01", "authors": ["MattiAdam", "SilvieGajdova", "HanaKolarova", "LukasKubala", "DeniseLau", "AnneGeisler", "ThorbenRavekes", "VolkerRudolph", "Philip STsao", "StefanBlankenberg", "StephanBaldus", "AnnaKlinke"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.06.009"}

As this inactivation usually results in loss of SMARCB1 expression, detectable by an antibody against the SMARCB1 protein, the accurate diagnosis of a rhabdoid tumor may be more distinctly and frequently made. Several reports on rhabdoid tumors presenting in various anatomic sites outside the kidneys and CNS are on record. We report two cases of rhabdoid tumors originating in the heart (cardiac tissue), which were entered into the European Rhabdoid Registry (EU-RHAB).

Although the underlying cardioprotective mechanism is unclear, it appears to be independent of metformin's insulin-sensitizing effect. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of metformin on the apoptosis pathway in the ischemic and nonischemic cardiac tissue in a swine model of metabolic syndrome.\nOssabaw miniswine were fed either a regular diet (Ossabaw control, n = 8), a high-cholesterol diet (Ossabaw high cholesterol, n = 8), or a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with metformin (Ossabaw high-cholesterol metformin, n = 8). After 9 wk, all animals underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor to the left circumflex coronary artery to induce chronic ischemia. Seven weeks after ameroid placement, animals underwent cardiac harvest.\nIn the chronically ischemic myocardium, metformin significantly upregulates prosurvival proteins: extracellular signal-regulated kinases, nuclear factor \u03baB, phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and P38. Metformin also significantly inhibits or downregulates proapoptosis proteins: FOXO3 and caspase 3. Metformin decreased the percent apoptotic cells in the ischemic and nonischemic myocardium. There was no difference in arteriolar density, capillary density, intramyocardial fibrosis, or collagen deposition in the ischemic or nonischemic myocardium.\nMetformin selectively alters the apoptosis pathway by inhibiting FOXO3 and decreasing the active form of caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3. Metformin also upregulates mitogen-activated kinase proteins p38 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, which are considered cardioprotective during ischemic preconditioning.

However, how variations in glucose are perceived by MSC pool is still unclear. Since, glucose metabolism is cell type and tissue dependent, this must be considered when MSCs are derived from alternative sources such as the heart. The zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 is an important early response gene, likely to play a key role in the glucose-induced response. Our aim was to investigate how short-term changes in in vitro glucose concentrations affect multipotent cardiac tissue-derived MSCs (cMSCs) in a mouse model of Egr-1 KO (Egr-1(-/-)). Results showed that loss of Egr-1 does not significantly influence cMSC proliferation. In contrast, responses to glucose variations were observed in wt but not in Egr-1(-/-) cMSCs by clonogenic assay. Phenotype analysis by RT-PCR showed that cMSCs Egr-1(-/-) lost the ability to regulate the glucose transporters GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 and, as expected, the Egr-1 target genes VEGF, TGF \u03b2 -1, and p300.

Further, mRNA expression was significantly altered in JAK/STAT signalling targets in Restricteds in a sex-specific manner. Compared with Controls, in males, JAK2 and STAT3 were significantly reduced in the Restricted, while in females SOCS3 was significantly increased and PI3K significantly decreased in the Restricted offspring. Finally, there were specific differences in the levels of gene expression within the JAK/STAT pathway when comparing males to females.

{"title": "Acute alcohol modulates cardiac function as PI3K/Akt regulates oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Clinical manifestations of alcohol abuse on the cardiac muscle include defective contractility with the development of heart failure. Interestingly, low alcohol consumption has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Although several hypotheses have been postulated for alcoholic cardiomyopathy and for the low-dose beneficial cardiovascular effects, the precise mechanisms and mediators remain largely undefined. We hypothesize that modulation of oxidative stress by PI3K/Akt plays a key role in the cardiac functional outcome to acute alcohol exposure.\nThus, acutely exposed rat cardiac tissue and cardiocytes to low (LA: 5 mM), moderate (MA: 25 mM), and high (HA: 100 mM) alcohol were assessed for markers of oxidative stress in the presence and absence of PI3K/Akt activators (IGF-1 0.1 \u03bcM or constitutively active PI3K: Ad.BD110 transfection) or inhibitor (LY294002 1 \u03bcM or Akt-negative construct Ad.Akt(K179M) transfection).\nAcute LA reduced Akt, superoxide dismutase (SOD-3) and NF\u03baB, ERK1, and p38 MAPK gene expression. Acute HA only increased that of SOD-3 and NF\u03baB. These effects were generally inhibited by Ad.Akt(K179M) and enhanced with Ad.BD110 transfection. In parallel, LA reduced but HA enhanced Akt activity, which was reversed by IGF-1 and inhibited by Ad.Akt(K179M), respectively. Also, LA reduced caspase 3/7 activity and oxidative stress, while HA increased both. The former was blocked, while the latter effect was enhanced by Ad.Akt(K179M). The reverse was true with PI3K/Akt activation. This translated into reduced viability with HA, with no effect with LA. On the functional level, acute LA improved cardiac output and ejection fraction, mainly through increased stroke volume. This was accompanied with enhanced end-systolic pressure-volume relationship and preload recruitable stroke work. Opposite effect was recorded for HA. LA and HA in vivo functional effects were alleviated by LY and enhanced by IGF-1 treatment.\nAcute LA and HA seem to oppositely affect cardiac function through modulation of oxidative stress where PI3K/Akt plays a pivotal role.", "journal": "Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research", "date": "2014-06-26", "authors": ["Nsini AUmoh", "Robin KWalker", "MustafaAl-Rubaiee", "Miara AJeffress", "Georges EHaddad"], "doi": "10.1111/acer.12459"}
{"title": "Capillary force lithography for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide(1). Cardiac tissue engineering holds much promise to deliver groundbreaking medical discoveries with the aims of developing functional tissues for cardiac regeneration as well as in vitro screening assays. However, the ability to create high-fidelity models of heart tissue has proven difficult. The heart's extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex structure consisting of both biochemical and biomechanical signals ranging from the micro- to the nanometer scale(2). Local mechanical loading conditions and cell-ECM interactions have recently been recognized as vital components in cardiac tissue engineering(3-5). A large portion of the cardiac ECM is composed of aligned collagen fibers with nano-scale diameters that significantly influences tissue architecture and electromechanical coupling(2). Unfortunately, few methods have been able to mimic the organization of ECM fibers down to the nanometer scale. Recent advancements in nanofabrication techniques, however, have enabled the design and fabrication of scalable scaffolds that mimic the in vivo structural and substrate stiffness cues of the ECM in the heart(6-9). Here we present the development of two reproducible, cost-effective, and scalable nanopatterning processes for the functional alignment of cardiac cells using the biocompatible polymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)(8) and a polyurethane (PU) based polymer. These anisotropically nanofabricated substrata (ANFS) mimic the underlying ECM of well-organized, aligned tissues and can be used to investigate the role of nanotopography on cell morphology and function(10-14). Using a nanopatterned (NP) silicon master as a template, a polyurethane acrylate (PUA) mold is fabricated. This PUA mold is then used to pattern the PU or PLGA hydrogel via UV-assisted or solvent-mediated capillary force lithography (CFL), respectively(15,16). Briefly, PU or PLGA pre-polymer is drop dispensed onto a glass coverslip and the PUA mold is placed on top. For UV-assisted CFL, the PU is then exposed to UV radiation (\u03bb = 250-400 nm) for curing. For solvent-mediated CFL, the PLGA is embossed using heat (120 \u00b0C) and pressure (100 kPa). After curing, the PUA mold is peeled off, leaving behind an ANFS for cell culture.

However, little is known about the extent and pathophysiological consequences of low thyroid conditions on the heart in DM. DM was induced in adult female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by injection of nicotinamide (N; 200 mg/kg) followed by streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg). One month after STZ/N, rats were randomized to the following groups (N = 10/group): STZ/N or STZ/N + 0.03 \u03bcg/mL T3; age-matched vehicle-treated rats served as nondiabetic controls (C). After 2 months of T3 treatment (3 months post-DM induction), left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by echocardiography and LV pressure measurements. Despite normal serum thyroid hormone (TH) levels, STZ/N treatment resulted in reductions in myocardial tissue content of THs (T3 and T4: 39% and 17% reduction versus C, respectively). Tissue hypothyroidism in the DM hearts was associated with increased DIO3 deiodinase (which converts THs to inactive metabolites) altered TH transporter expression, reexpression of the fetal gene phenotype, reduced arteriolar resistance vessel density, and diminished cardiac function. Low-dose T3 replacement largely restored cardiac tissue TH levels (T3 and T4: 43% and 10% increase versus STZ/N, respectively), improved cardiac function, reversed fetal gene expression and preserved the arteriolar resistance vessel network without causing overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism. We conclude that cardiac dysfunction in chronic DM may be associated with tissue hypothyroidism despite normal serum TH levels.

We hypothesize that targeted delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to MI can help regenerate vasculature in support of MSC therapy in a rat model of MI. VEGF-encapsulated immunoliposomes targeting overexpressed P-selectin in MI tissue were infused by tail vein immediately after MI. One week later, MSCs were injected intramyocardially. The cardiac function loss was moderated slightly by targeted delivery of VEGF or MSC treatment. Targeted VEGF+MSC combination treatment showed highest attenuation in cardiac function loss. The combination treatment also increased blood vessel density (80%) and decreased collagen content in post-MI tissue (33%). Engraftment of MSCs in the combination treatment group was significantly increased and the engrafted cells contributed to the restoration of blood vessels.\nVEGF immunoliposomes targeting myocardial infarction tissue resulted in significantly higher attenuation of cardiac function loss when used in combination with mesenchymal stem cells. MSCs were previously found to have poor ability to restore cardiac tissue, likely as a result of poor blood supply in the affected areas.

A cross-sectional analysis of myocardial tissue from 119 IDC and non-failing (NF) control samples was performed. Electrospray ionizing mass spectrometry was used to measure total CL and CL species content in LV tissue. RT-PCR was employed to measure gene expression of the enzymes in the CL biosynthesis and remodeling pathways in both the adult and pediatric heart. Significantly lower total and (18:2)4CL (the beneficial species) content was demonstrated in myocardium from pediatric patients with IDC compared to NF controls. Analysis of mitochondrial gene transcripts was used to demonstrate that there is no decrease in mitochondrial content. Expression of two biosynthesis enzymes and one remodeling enzyme was significantly lower in pediatric IDC compared to NF controls. Expression of two phospholipases involved in CL degradation were also altered, one up- and one down-regulated. Except for one remodeling enzyme, these changes are unique from those in the failing adult heart. Similar to what has been seen in adults and in a rat model of IDC, total and (18:2)4CL are lower in pediatric IDC.

Further, plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and nitric oxide (NO) are associated with the degree of heart dysfunction in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC). Thus, our aim was to establish experimental models that mimic a range of parasitological, pathological and cardiac alterations described in patients with chronic Chagas' heart disease and evaluate whether heart disease severity was associated with increased TNF and NO levels in the serum. Our results show that C3H/He mice chronically infected with the Colombian T. cruzi strain have more severe cardiac parasitism and inflammation than C57BL/6 mice. In addition, connexin 43 disorganisation and fibronectin deposition in the heart tissue, increased levels of creatine kinase cardiac MB isoenzyme activity in the serum and more severe electrical abnormalities were observed in T. cruzi-infected C3H/He mice compared to C57BL/6 mice. Therefore, T. cruzi-infected C3H/He and C57BL/6 mice represent severe and mild models of CCC, respectively. Moreover, the CCC severity paralleled the TNF and NO levels in the serum.

They control the mRNA stability of several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10. Whereas MK2 is expressed ubiquitously, the expression of MK3 is restricted to muscle, liver, and heart tissues and T and NK cells. Using Mk-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice, we demonstrated an inhibitory effect of MK3, but not of MK2, on interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 expression in T and NK lymphocytes. The results provided evidence that the inhibitory effect of MK3 is based on negative feedback phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2, which causes decreased binding of Stat4 to the IFN-\u03b3 promoter and reduced expression of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA and protein. Consequently, all Mk3(-/-) mice challenged with the Th1-inducing influenza A virus (IAV) survived the WT LD50 virus dose. The reduced disease severity in the Mk3(-/-) mice was accompanied by a >10-fold reduction in viral lung titer and an increase in the number of activated NK cells and enhanced Th1 activation of CD4 T cells.

{"title": "Distinct functions of the laminin \u03b2 LN domain and collagen IV during cardiac extracellular matrix formation and stabilization of alary muscle attachments revealed by EMS mutagenesis in Drosophila.", "abstract": "The Drosophila heart (dorsal vessel) is a relatively simple tubular organ that serves as a model for several aspects of cardiogenesis. Cardiac morphogenesis, proper heart function and stability require structural components whose identity and ways of assembly are only partially understood. Structural components are also needed to connect the myocardial tube with neighboring cells such as pericardial cells and specialized muscle fibers, the so-called alary muscles.\nUsing an EMS mutagenesis screen for cardiac and muscular abnormalities in Drosophila embryos we obtained multiple mutants for two genetically interacting complementation groups that showed similar alary muscle and pericardial cell detachment phenotypes. The molecular lesions underlying these defects were identified as domain-specific point mutations in LamininB1 and Cg25C, encoding the extracellular matrix (ECM) components laminin \u03b2 and collagen IV \u03b11, respectively. Of particular interest within the LamininB1 group are certain hypomorphic mutants that feature prominent defects in cardiac morphogenesis and cardiac ECM layer formation, but in contrast to amorphic mutants, only mild defects in other tissues. All of these alleles carry clustered missense mutations in the laminin LN domain. The identified Cg25C mutants display weaker and largely temperature-sensitive phenotypes that result from glycine substitutions in different Gly-X-Y repeats of the triple helix-forming domain. While initial basement membrane assembly is not abolished in Cg25C mutants, incorporation of perlecan is impaired and intracellular accumulation of perlecan as well as the collagen IV \u03b12 chain is detected during late embryogenesis.\nAssembly of the cardiac ECM depends primarily on laminin, whereas collagen IV is needed for stabilization. Our data underscore the importance of a correctly assembled ECM particularly for the development of cardiac tissues and their lateral connections. The mutational analysis suggests that the \u03b26/\u03b23/\u03b28 interface of the laminin \u03b2 LN domain is highly critical for formation of contiguous cardiac ECM layers. Certain mutations in the collagen IV triple helix-forming domain may exert a semi-dominant effect leading to an overall weakening of ECM structures as well as intracellular accumulation of collagen and other molecules, thus paralleling observations made in other organisms and in connection with collagen-related diseases.", "journal": "BMC developmental biology", "date": "2014-06-18", "authors": ["DominikHollfelder", "ManfredFrasch", "IngolfReim"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-213X-14-26"}
{"title": "NOD1 receptor is up-regulated in diabetic human and murine myocardium.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes has a complex pathology that involves a chronic inflammatory state. Emerging evidence suggests a link between the innate immune system receptor NOD1 (nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain 1) and the pathogenesis of diabetes, in monocytes and hepatic and adipose tissues. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of NOD1\u00a0in the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. We have measured NOD1 protein in cardiac tissue from Type\u00a02 diabetic (db) mice. Heart and isolated cardiomyocytes from db mice revealed a significant increase in NOD1, together with an up-regulation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and increased apoptosis. Heart tissue also exhibited an enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Selective NOD1 activation with C12-\u03b3-D-glutamyl-m-diaminopimelic acid (iEDAP) resulted in an increased NF-\u03baB activation and apoptosis, demonstrating the involvement of NOD1 both in wild-type and db mice. Moreover, HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to elevated concentrations of glucose plus palmitate displayed an enhanced NF-\u03baB activity and apoptotic profile, which was prevented by silencing of NOD1 expression. To address this issue in human pathology, NOD1 expression was evaluated in myocardium obtained from patients with Type\u00a02 diabetes (T2DMH) and from normoglycaemic individuals without cardiovascular histories (NH). We have found that NOD1 was expressed in both NH and T2DMH; however, NOD1 expression was significantly pronounced in T2DMH. Furthermore, both the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and the apoptosis mediator caspase-3 were up-regulated in T2DMH samples.

Two treatment plans were created for each case using tumour bed planning target volume (PTV) margins of 5\u00a0mm (achieved with image-guided radiotherapy) and 8\u00a0mm (required for bony anatomy verification). Dose data were collected for breast, lung and heart; differences with margin size were tested for statistical significance.\nA median decrease of 29\u00a0cm(3) (range 11-193\u00a0cm(3)) of breast tissue receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was observed where image-guided radiotherapy margins were used. Decreases in doses to lungs, contralateral breast and heart were modest, but statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Plan quality was compromised with the 8\u00a0mm PTV margin in one in eight sequential boost plans and one third of concomitant boost plans.

Incorporation of varying concentrations of CNTs from 0 to 1.5% within the PG nanofibrous scaffolds (CNT-PG scaffolds) notably enhanced fiber alignment and improved the electrical conductivity and toughness of the scaffolds while maintaining the viability, retention, alignment, and contractile activities of cardiomyocytes (CMs) seeded on the scaffolds. The resulting CNT-PG scaffolds resulted in stronger spontaneous and synchronous beating behavior (3.5-fold lower excitation threshold and 2.8-fold higher maximum capture rate) compared to those cultured on PG scaffold.

Thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 are homologous secreted proteins, which have previously been reported to be overexpressed during remodeling typical for wound healing and tumor progression and to possibly play a functional role in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. To our knowledge, a complete immunohistochemical characterization of thrombospondins levels in normal rodent tissues has not been reported so far. Using antibody phage technology, we have generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies specific to murine thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2, two antigens which share 62% aminoacid identity. An immunofluorescence analysis revealed that both antigens are virtually undetectable in normal mouse tissues, except for a weak staining of heart tissue by antibodies specific to thrombospondin-1. The analysis also showed that thrombospondin-1 was strongly expressed in 5/7 human tumors xenografted in nude mice, while it was only barely detectable in 3/8 murine tumors grafted in immunocompetent mice. By contrast, a high-affinity antibody to thrombospondin-2 revealed a much lower level of expression of this antigen in cancer specimens. Our analysis resolves ambiguities related to conflicting reports on thrombosponding expression in health and disease.

It is known that CVB3-induced T-cell infiltration into cardiac tissues is one of the pathological factors causing cardiomyocyte injury by inflammation. However, the underlying mechanism for this remains unclear. We investigated the mechanism of T-cell infiltration by two types of CVB3: the H3 WT strain and the YYFF attenuated strain. T-cell activation was confirmed by changes in the distribution of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). Finally, we identified which viral gene was responsible for LFA-1 activation. CVB3 could infect and activate T-cells in vivo and in vitro, and activated T-cells were detected in CVB3-infected mouse hearts. LFA-1 expressed on the surface of these T-cells had been activated through the cAMP/Rap1 pathway. Recombinant lentiviruses expressing VP2 of CVB3 could also induce LFA-1 activation via an increase in cAMP, whilst VP2 of YYFF did not. These results indicated that CVB3 infection increased cAMP levels and then activated Rap1 in T-cells. In particular, VP2, among the CVB3 proteins, might be critical for this activation.

{"title": "Mitochondrial inefficiencies and anoxic ATP hydrolysis capacities in diabetic rat heart.", "abstract": "As ~80% of diabetic patients die from heart failure, an understanding of diabetic cardiomyopathy is crucial. Mitochondria occupy 35-40% of the mammalian cardiomyocyte volume and supply 95% of the heart's ATP, and diabetic heart mitochondria show impaired structure, arrangement, and function. We predict that bioenergetic inefficiencies are present in diabetic heart mitochondria; therefore, we explored mitochondrial proton and electron handling by linking oxygen flux to steady-state ATP synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) within rat heart tissues. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg) to induce type 1 diabetes or an equivalent volume of saline (control, n = 12) and fed standard rat chow for 8 wk. By coupling high-resolution respirometers with purpose-built fluorometers, we followed Magnesium Green (ATP synthesis), Amplex UltraRed (ROS production), and safranin-O (\u0394\u03a8). Relative to control rats, the mass-specific respiration of STZ-diabetic hearts was depressed in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) states. Steady-state ATP synthesis capacity was almost one-third lower in STZ-diabetic heart, which, relative to oxygen flux, equates to an estimated 12% depression in OXPHOS efficiency. However, with anoxic transition, STZ-diabetic and control heart tissues showed similar ATP hydrolysis capacities through reversal of the F1F0-ATP synthase. STZ-diabetic cardiac mitochondria also produced more net ROS relative to oxygen flux (ROS/O) in OXPHOS. While \u0394\u03a8 did not differ between groups, the time to develop \u0394\u03a8 with the onset of OXPHOS was protracted in STZ-diabetic mitochondria. ROS/O is higher in lifelike OXPHOS states, and potential delays in the time to develop \u0394\u03a8 may delay ATP synthesis with interbeat fluctuations in ADP concentrations.

{"title": "Fractional diffusion models of cardiac electrical propagation: role of structural heterogeneity in dispersion of repolarization.", "abstract": "Impulse propagation in biological tissues is known to be modulated by structural heterogeneity. In cardiac muscle, improved understanding on how this heterogeneity influences electrical spread is key to advancing our interpretation of dispersion of repolarization. We propose fractional diffusion models as a novel mathematical description of structurally heterogeneous excitable media, as a means of representing the modulation of the total electric field by the secondary electrical sources associated with tissue inhomogeneities. Our results, analysed against in vivo human recordings and experimental data of different animal species, indicate that structural heterogeneity underlies relevant characteristics of cardiac electrical propagation at tissue level.

{"title": "Effects of functional feeds on the lipid composition, transcriptomic responses and pathology in heart of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) before and after experimental challenge with Piscine Myocarditis Virus (PMCV).", "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) is a severe cardiac disease of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) recently associated with a double-stranded RNA virus, Piscine Myocarditis Virus (PMCV). The disease has been diagnosed in 75-85 farms in Norway each year over the last decade resulting in annual economic losses estimated at up to \u20ac9 million. Recently, we demonstrated that functional feeds led to a milder inflammatory response and reduced severity of heart lesions in salmon experimentally infected with Atlantic salmon reovirus, the causal agent of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI). In the present study we employed a similar strategy to investigate the effects of functional feeds, with reduced lipid content and increased eicosapentaenoic acid levels, in controlling CMS in salmon after experimental infection with PMCV.\nHepatic steatosis associated with CMS was significantly reduced over the time course of the infection in fish fed the functional feeds. Significant differences in immune and inflammatory responses and pathology in heart tissue were found in fish fed the different dietary treatments over the course of the infection. Specifically, fish fed the functional feeds showed a milder and delayed inflammatory response and, consequently, less severity of heart lesions at earlier and later stages after infection with PMCV. Decreasing levels of phosphatidylinositol in cell membranes combined with the increased expression of genes related with T-cell signalling pathways revealed new interactions between dietary lipid composition and the immune response in fish during viral infection. Dietary histidine supplementation did not significantly affect immune responses or levels of heart lesions.\nCombined with the previous findings on HSMI, the results of the present study highlight the potential role of clinical nutrition in controlling inflammatory diseases in Atlantic salmon. In particular, dietary lipid content and fatty acid composition may have important immune-modulatory effects in Atlantic salmon that could be potentially beneficial in fish balancing the immune and tissue responses to viral infections.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2014-06-13", "authors": ["LauraMartinez-Rubio", "\u00d8ysteinEvensen", "AlekseiKrasnov", "Sven MartinJ\u00f8rgensen", "SimonWadsworth", "KariRuohonen", "Jose L GVecino", "Douglas RTocher"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-15-462\n10.1128/JVI.02154-10\n10.1136/vr.146.17.500\n10.3354/dao02123\n10.3354/dao056241\n10.3354/dao008225\n10.1186/1471-2164-12-459\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-205\n10.1079/BJN/2002529\n10.1016/j.fsi.2011.02.023\n10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.08.015\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.08.007\n10.1007/s11745-004-1344-x\n10.1016/j.plefa.2008.09.016\n10.1016/S0952-3278(96)90013-7\n10.1007/BF02524291\n10.1016/j.fsi.2010.08.024\n10.1016/0952-3278(93)90075-8\n10.1007/BF00002457\n10.1016/j.cbpb.2007.04.021\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040266\n10.1111/j.1095-8649.2002.tb02493.x\n10.1016/S0955-2863(98)00022-9\n10.1007/BF02970153\n10.1016/j.molimm.2011.08.007\n10.1016/j.fsi.2013.03.363\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2006.00710.x\n10.1159/000177997\n10.1111/j.1365-2095.2007.00458.x\n10.1080/713610925\n10.1016/S0009-3084(03)00101-4\n10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.12.010\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.09.025\n10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.04.034\n10.1186/1471-2164-12-255\n10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2011.12.015\n10.1016/j.molimm.2008.08.265\n10.1073/pnas.0508327102\n10.1016/0300-9629(95)00042-6\n10.1016/S0899-9007(02)00852-3\n10.1016/j.fsi.2007.08.002\n10.1007/s10126-005-5164-4\n10.1093/nar/30.9.e36"}

Albino rats were randomly divided into four individual groups: Group-I control (n=6), group-II alloxan-induced diabetic rats, untreated (n=6), group-III (n=6) and group-IV (n=6) alloxan-induced diabetic rats were treated with aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Cynodon dactylon for 15 days, respectively. Animals were euthanized to collect the heart tissues and blood samples. 2DE sample preparation, gel running and staining (n=6: each groups) were performed at the same time to avoid variation. The result of six gel images from each group were analyzed and evaluated as one match set with 2D software (P<0.05).\nThe above experiment revealed two up-regulated proteins in group-II i.e. NTF4 and ETFB.\nNTF4 is a neuro-protective agent for neuro-degenerative diseases. It will prevent diabetic secondary complications, such as diabetic polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. ETFB is active in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centres in cells.

Here we propose a multistep procedure to prepare pre-vascularized three-dimensional (3D) cardiac bio-substitutes using dynamic cell cultures and highly porous biocompatible gelatin scaffolds. The strategy adopted exploits the peculiar differentiation potential of two distinct subsets of adult stem cells to obtain human vascularized 3D cardiac tissues. In the first step of the procedure, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are seeded onto gelatin scaffolds to provide interconnected vessel-like structures, while human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) are stimulated in vitro to obtain their commitment toward the cardiac phenotype. The use of a modular bioreactor allows the perfusion of the whole scaffold, providing superior performance in terms of cardiac tissue maturation and cell survival. Both the cell culture on natural-derived polymers and the continuous medium perfusion of the scaffold led to the formation of a densely packaged proto-tissue composed of vascular-like and cardiac-like cells, which might complete maturation process and interconnect with native tissue upon in vivo implantation.

{"title": "Investigation into the effects of varying frequency of mechanical stimulation in a cycle-by-cycle manner on engineered cardiac construct function.", "abstract": "Mechanical stimulation has been used extensively to improve the function of cardiac engineered tissue, as it mimics the physical environment in which the tissue is situated during normal development. However, previous mechanical stimulation has been carried out under a constant frequency that more closely resembles a diseased heart. The goal of this study was to create a bioreactor system that would allow us to control the mechanical stimulation of engineered cardiac tissue on a cycle-by-cycle basis. This unique system allows us to determine the effects on cardiac construct function of introducing variability to the mechanical stretch. To test our bioreactor system, constructs created from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes entrapped in fibrin hydrogels were stimulated under various regimes for 2 weeks and then assessed for functional outcomes. No differences were observed in the final cell number in each condition, indicating that variability in frequency did not have a negative effect on viability. The forces were higher for all mechanical stimulation groups compared to static controls, although no differences were observed between the mechanically stimulated conditions, indicating that variable frequency on a cycle-by-cycle basis has limited effects on the resulting force. Although differences in the observed twitch force were not observed, differences in the protein expression indicate that variable-frequency mechanical stimulation had an effect on cell-cell coupling and growth pathway activation in the constructs. Thus, this bioreactor system provides a valuable tool for further development and optimization of engineered myocardial tissue as a repair or replacement strategy for patients undergoing heart failure.

In this study, we analyzed Raman spectra of myocardial infarction and its repair in rats using the hypothesis that the myocardium in the course of myocardial infarction and its repair could be recognized by spontaneous Raman spectroscopy on the basis of chemical changes in myocardial tissues. Raman spectra were acquired from unfixed frozen cross sections of normal and infarcted heart tissues upon excitation at 532 nm. Raman spectra of the infarcted tissues were successfully obtained at characteristic time points: days 2, 5, and 21 after coronary ligation, at which the main components of the infarcted region were coagulation necrosis, granulation tissue, and fibrotic tissue, respectively. The latent variable weights calculated by a multivariate classification method, partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), revealed fundamental information about the spectral differences among the types of tissues on the basis of molecular constituents. A prediction model for the evaluation of these tissue types was established via PLS-DA. Cross-validated sensitivities of 99.3, 95.3, 96.4, and 91.3% and specificities of 99.4, 99.5, 96.5, and 98.3% were attained for the discrimination of normal, necrotic, granulation, and fibrotic tissue, respectively.

In line with prolongation of APR R(+)-pulegone, in a concentration-dependent manner, blocked distinct potassium current components (transient outward potassium current (I(to)), rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kr)), inactivating steady state potassium current (I(ss)) and inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1))) (EC50=1441\u00b11.04; 605.0\u00b11.22, 818.7\u00b11.22; 1753\u00b11.09 \u03bcM for I(to), I(Kr), I(ss) and I(K1), respectively). The inhibition occurred in a fast and reversible way, without changing the steady-state activation curve, but instead shifting to the left the steady-state inactivation curve (V1/2 from -56.92\u00b10.35 to -67.52\u00b10.19 mV). In vivo infusion of 100 mg/kg R(+)-pulegone prolonged the QTc (\u223c40%) and PR (\u223c62%) interval along with reducing the heart rate by \u223c26%.\nTaken together, R(+)-pulegone prolongs the APR by inhibiting several cardiomyocyte K(+) current components in a concentration-dependent manner. This occurs through a direct block by R(+)-pulegone of the channel pore, followed by a left shift on the steady state inactivation curve. Finally, R(+)-pulegone induced changes in some aspects of the ECG profile, which are in agreement with its effects on potassium channels of isolated cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2014-06-11", "authors": ["ArturSantos-Miranda", "Antonio NeiGondim", "Jose Evaldo RodriguesMenezes-Filho", "Carla Marina LinsVasconcelos", "Jader SantosCruz", "DaniloRoman-Campos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2014.05.007"}

Therefore, the aims of the present work were to assess whether (1) up-regulated HMGB1 could directly lead to cardiac fibrosis in EAM; (2) cardiac fibroblast/myofibroblasts could secrete HMGB1 as another source of high-level HMGB1 in EAM; and (3) HMGB1 blockade could effectively prevent cardiac fibrosis at the last stage of EAM.

{"title": "Sustained delivery of MGF peptide from microrods attracts stem cells and reduces apoptosis of myocytes.", "abstract": "Local release of drugs may have many advantages for tissue repair but also presents major challenges. Bioengineering approaches allow microstructures to be fabricated that contain bioactive peptides for sustained local delivery. Heart tissue damage is associated with local increases in mechano growth factor (MGF), a member of the IGF-1 family. The E domain of MGF peptide is anti-apoptotic and a stem cell homing factor. The objectives of this study were to fabricate a microrod delivery device of poly (ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) hydrogel loaded with MGF peptide and to determine the elution profile and bioactivity of MGF. The injectable microrods are 30 kPa stiffness and 15\u00a0\u03bcm widths by 100\u00a0\u03bcm lengths, chosen to match heart stiffness and myocyte size. Successful encapsulation of native MGF peptide within microrods was achieved with delivery of MGF for 2\u00a0weeks, as measured by HPLC. Migration of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) increased with MGF microrod treatment (1.72\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Inhibition of the apoptotic pathway in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes was induced by 8\u00a0h of hypoxia (1\u00a0% O2).

Microrods without MGF regulated the cytoskeleton, adhesion, and proliferation of hMSCs, and MGF had no effect on these properties.

Clinically, ANP is used as a marker of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure. Although multiple ANP assays are currently available, a more sensitive assay is required for the direct measurement of plasma ANP where there is limited plasma availability, especially in mouse experiments. In the current study, we developed a plate-based sandwich chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of plasma ANP in rats and mice without the need for prior extraction. To minimize nonspecific binding, we performed a single-step PEGylation procedure targeting the immobilized antibody, which markedly improved the assay's sensitivity and linearity. The linear range was 0.1 to 250 pM, and the minimum detection limit was 0.13 pM, 5-fold lower than the lowest value of the commercially available kits. ANP was directly measured in plasma samples without detectable cross-reactivity with B- and C-type natriuretic peptides.

Our results show that restricting protein consumption in pregnant females induced decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity (51% reduction in ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption and 49.5% reduction in respiratory control ratio) in their progeny when compared with NP group.

Fenofibrate is reported as a cardioprotective agent in various models of cardiac dysfunction; however, limited literature is available regarding the role of gemfibrozil as a possible cardioprotective agent, especially in a non-obese model of cardiac remodelling. The present study investigated the role of gemfibrozil against partial abdominal aortic constriction-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by partial abdominal aortic constriction in rats and they survived for 4 weeks. The cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by measuring left ventricular weight to body weight ratio, left ventricular wall thickness, and protein and collagen content. The oxidative stress in the cardiac tissues was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, superoxide anion generation, and reduced glutathione level. The haematoxylin-eosin and picrosirius red staining was used to observe cardiomyocyte diameter and collagen deposition, respectively. Moreover, serum levels of cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, and glucose were also measured. Gemfibrozil (30 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered since the first day of partial abdominal aortic constriction and continued for 4 weeks. The partial abdominal aortic constriction-induced cardiac oxidative stress and hypertrophy are indicated by significant change in various parameters used in the present study that were ameliorated with gemfibrozil treatment in rats.

Indeed, stem-cell-based therapies have the potential to transform the treatment and prognosis of heart failure, for they have the potential to eliminate the underlying cause of the disease by reconstituting the damaged heart with functional cardiac cells. Over the last decade, several independent laboratories have demonstrated the utility of c-kit+/Lin- resident CSCs in alleviating left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling in animal models of acute and chronic myocardial infarction. Recently, the first clinical trial of autologous CSCs for treatment of heart failure resulting from ischemic heart disease (Stem Cell Infusion in Patients with Ischemic cardiOmyopathy [SCIPIO]) has been conducted, and the interim results are quite promising. In this phase I trial, no adverse effects attributable to the CSC treatment have been noted, and CSC-treated patients showed a significant improvement in ejection fraction at 1\u00a0year (+13.7 absolute units versus baseline), accompanied by a 30.2\u00a0% reduction in infarct size. Moreover, the CSC-induced enhancement in cardiac structure and function was associated with a significant improvement in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and in the quality of life, as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart failure Questionnaire.

{"title": "Humid heat exposure induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes through the angiotensin II signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Exposure to humid heat stress leads to the initiation of serious physiological dysfunction that may result in heat-related diseases, including heat stroke, heat cramp, heat exhaustion, and even death. Increasing evidences have shown that the humid heat stress-induced dysfunction of the cardiovascular system was accompanied with severe cardiomyocyte injury; however, the precise mechanism of heat stress-induced injury of cardiomyocyte remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that humid heat stress promoted oxidative stress through the activation of angiotensin II (Ang II) in cardiomyocytes. To test our hypothesis, we established mouse models of humid heat stress. Using the animal models, we found that Ang II levels in serum were significantly up-regulated and that the Ang II receptor AT1 was increased in cardiomyocytes. The antioxidant ability in plasma and heart tissues which was detected by the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay was also decreased with the increased ROS production under humid heat stress, as was the expression of antioxidant genes (SOD2, HO-1, GPx). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Ang II receptor antagonist, valsartan, effectively relieved oxidative stress, blocked Ang II signaling pathway and suppressed cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by humid heat stress. In addition, overexpression of antioxidant genes reversed cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by Ang II. Overall, these results implied that humid heat stress increased oxidative stress and caused apoptosis of cardiomyocytes through the Ang II signaling pathway. Thus, targeting the Ang II signaling pathway may provide a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases caused by humid heat stress.", "journal": "Heart and vessels", "date": "2014-06-06", "authors": ["XiaowuWang", "BinbinYuan", "WenpengDong", "BoYang", "YongchaoYang", "XiLin", "GuGong"], "doi": "10.1007/s00380-014-0523-6"}

Rats were distributed into two groups and assigned to a control diet or a diet including 3% heated GL (GL diet) for three months. Feces and urine were collected over the last week. After sacrifice, serum was obtained and some organs were removed for CML analysis. The percentage of fecal CML was 2.5-fold higher in the animals fed the GL diet (33.2 vs 76.5% for control and GL group), whereby total recovery was 91.8% compared with a level of 54.6% in the animals fed the control chow, evidencing the importance of the chemical form and the net quantity of dietary CML on its elimination.

{"title": "Guanabenz interferes with ER stress and exerts protective effects in cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. During ER stress, disruption of the complex of protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A and catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 by the small molecule guanabenz (antihypertensive, \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonist) and subsequent inhibition of stress-induced dephosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) results in prolonged eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, inhibition of protein synthesis and protection from ER stress. In this study we assessed whether guanabenz protects against ER stress in cardiac myocytes and affects the function of 3 dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT). We utilized neonatal rat cardiac myocytes for the assessment of cell viability and activation of ER stress-signalling pathways and EHT for functional analysis. (i) Tunicamycin induced ER stress as measured by increased mRNA and protein levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa, P-eIF2\u03b1, activating transcription factor 4, C/EBP homologous protein, and cell death. (ii) Guanabenz had no measurable effect alone, but antagonized the effects of tunicamycin on ER stress markers. (iii) Tunicamycin and other known inducers of ER stress (hydrogen peroxide, doxorubicin, thapsigargin) induced cardiac myocyte death, and this was antagonized by guanabenz in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. (iv) ER stressors also induced acute or delayed contractile dysfunction in spontaneously beating EHTs and this was, with the notable exception of relaxation deficits under thapsigargin, not significantly affected by guanabenz. The data confirm that guanabenz interferes with ER stress-signalling and has protective effects on cell survival. Data show for the first time that this concept extends to cardiac myocytes. The modest protection in EHTs points to more complex mechanisms of force regulation in intact functional heart muscle.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-06-04", "authors": ["ChristianeNeuber", "JuneUebeler", "ThomasSchulze", "HanniehSotoud", "AliEl-Armouche", "ThomasEschenhagen"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0098893"}

Herein, we explored the role of miRNAs in TOF. Among 75 dysregulated miRNAs identified from human heart tissues, miRNA-940 was the most down-regulated one. Interestingly, miRNA-940 was most highly expressed in normal human right ventricular out-flow tract comparing to other heart chambers. As TOF is caused by altered proliferation, migration and/or differentiation of the progenitor cells of the secondary heart field, we isolated Sca-1(+) human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPC) for miRNA-940 function analysis. miRNA-940 reduction significantly promoted hCMPCs proliferation and inhibited hCMPCs migration. We found that JARID2 is an endogenous target regulated by miRNA-940. Functional analyses showed that JARID2 also affected hCMPCs proliferation and migration. Thus, decreased miRNA-940 affects the proliferation and migration of the progenitor cells of the secondary heart field by targeting JARID2 and potentially leads to TOF development.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2014-06-04", "authors": ["DandanLiang", "XinranXu", "FangfeiDeng", "JingFeng", "HongZhang", "YingLiu", "YangyangZhang", "LeiPan", "YiLiu", "DashengZhang", "JunLi", "XingqunLiang", "YunfuSun", "JunjieXiao", "Yi-HanChen"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.12309"}

Ischemic injury to the heart during myocardial infarction (MI) results in the cleavage of cMyBP-C in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and release of an N-terminal fragment (C0C1f) into the circulation. C0C1f has been shown to be pathogenic within cardiac tissue, leading to the development of heart failure. Based on its high levels and early release into the circulation post-MI, C0C1f may serve as a novel biomarker for diagnosing MI more effectively than current clinically used biomarkers. Over time, circulating C0C1f could trigger an autoimmune response leading to myocarditis and progressive cardiac dysfunction. Given the importance of cMyBP-C phosphorylation state in the context of proteolytic cleavage and release into the circulation post-MI, understanding the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of cMyBP-C would help in further elucidating the role of this protein in health and disease. Accordingly, recent studies have implemented the latest proteomics approaches to define the PTMs of cMyBP-C. The use of such proteomics assays may provide accurate quantitation of the levels of cMyBP-C in the circulation following MI, which could, in turn, demonstrate the efficacy of using plasma cMyBP-C as a cardiac-specific early biomarker of MI. In this review, we define the pathogenic and potential immunogenic effects of C0C1f on cardiac function in the post-MI heart. We also discuss the most advanced proteomics approaches now used to determine cMyBP-C PTMs with the aim of validating C0C1f as an early biomarker of MI.", "journal": "Proteomics.

Increased availability of acylcarnitines has been associated with decreased glucose utilization; however, the effects of long-chain acylcarnitines on glucose metabolism have not been previously studied. We tested how changes in long-chain acylcarnitine content regulate the metabolism of glucose and long-chain fatty acids in cardiac mitochondria in fed and fasted states. We examined the concentrations of metabolic intermediates in plasma and cardiac tissues under fed and fasted states. The effects of substrate availability and their competition for energy production at the mitochondrial level were studied in isolated rat cardiac mitochondria. The availability of long-chain acylcarnitines in plasma reflected their content in cardiac tissue in the fed and fasted states, and acylcarnitine content in the heart was fivefold higher in fasted state compared to the fed state. In substrate competition experiments, pyruvate and fatty acid metabolites effectively competed for the energy production pathway; however, only the physiological content of acylcarnitine significantly reduced pyruvate and lactate oxidation in mitochondria. The increased availability of long-chain acylcarnitine significantly reduced glucose utilization in isolated rat heart model and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that changes in long-chain acylcarnitine contents could orchestrate the interplay between the metabolism of pyruvate-lactate and long-chain fatty acids, and thus determine the pattern of energy metabolism in cardiac mitochondria.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2014-06-01", "authors": ["MarinaMakrecka", "JanisKuka", "KristineVolska", "UnigundeAntone", "EduardsSevostjanovs", "HelenaCirule", "SolveigaGrinberga", "OsvaldsPugovics", "MaijaDambrova", "EdgarsLiepinsh"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-014-2106-3"}

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of ALDH2 on diabetes-induced myocardial injury with a focus on autophagy. Wild-type FVB and ALDH2 transgenic mice were challenged with streptozotozin (STZ, 200mg/kg, i.p.) for 3months to induce experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetes triggered cardiac remodeling and contractile dysfunction as evidenced by cardiac hypertrophy, decreased cell shortening and prolonged relengthening duration, the effects of which were mitigated by ALDH2. Lectin staining displayed that diabetes promoted cardiac hypertrophy, the effect of which was alleviated by ALDH2. Western blot analysis revealed dampened autophagy protein markers including LC3B ratio and Atg7 along with upregulated p62 following experimental diabetes, the effect of which was reconciled by ALDH2. Phosphorylation level of AMPK was decreased and its downstream signaling molecule FOXO3a was upregulated in both diabetic cardiac tissue and in H9C2 cells with high glucose exposure. All these effect were partly abolished by ALDH2 overexpression and ALDH2 agonist Alda1. High glucose challenge dampened autophagy in H9C2 cells as evidenced by enhanced p62 levels and decreased levels of Atg7 and LC3B, the effect of which was alleviated by the ALDH2 activator Alda-1. High glucose-induced cell death and apoptosis were reversed by Alda-1. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and the AMPK inhibitor compound C mitigated Alda-1-offered beneficial effect whereas the autophagy inducer rapamycin mimicked or exacerbated high glucose-induced cell injury. Moreover, compound C nullified Alda-1-induced protection against STZ-induced changes in autophagy and function.

Two human cohorts were used to analyze changes to the LTA4H-PGP pathway in never smokers, control smokers, COPD smokers, and COPD former smokers. PGP/AcPGP and LTA4H aminopeptidase activity were detected by mass spectroscopy, LTA4H amounts were detected by ELISA, and acrolein was detected by Western blot.\nMice exposed to cigarette smoke developed emphysema with increased PGP, neutrophilic inflammation, and selective inhibition of LTA4H aminopeptidase, which ordinarily degrades PGP. We recapitulated these findings in smokers with and without COPD. PGP and AcPGP are closely associated with cigarette smoke use. Once chronic inflammation is established, changes to LTA4H aminopeptidase remain, even in the absence of ongoing cigarette use.

The cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) field is migrating towards ECV, because it is largely insensitive to confounders that affect post-contrast myocardial T1 . Despite the theoretical advantages of myocardial ECV over post-contrast myocardial T1 , systematic experimental studies comparing the two measurements are largely lacking. We sought to measure the temporal changes in post-contrast myocardial T1 and ECV in an established canine model with chronic atrial fibrillation. Seventeen mongrel dogs, implanted with a pacemaker to induce chronic atrial fibrillation via rapid atrial pacing, were scanned multiple times for a total of 46 CMR scans at 3T. These dogs with different disease durations (0-22 months) were part of a separate longitudinal study aimed at studying the relationship between AF and pathophysiology. In each animal, we measured native and post-contrast T1 values and hematocrit. Temporal changes in post-contrast myocardial T1 and ECV, as well as other CMR parameters, were modeled with linear mixed effect models to account for repeated measurements over disease duration. In 17 animals, post-contrast myocardial T1 decreased significantly from 872 to 698 ms (p < 0.001), which corresponds to a 24.9% relative reduction. In contrast, ECV increased from 21.0 to 22.0% (p = 0.38), which corresponds to only a 4.5% relative increase. To partially investigate this discrepancy, we quantified collagen volume fraction (CVF) in post-mortem heart tissues of six canines sacrificed at different disease durations (0-22 months). CVF quantified by histology increased from 0.9 to 1.9% (p = 0.56), which agrees better with ECV than with post-contrast myocardial T1 .

This focus has given rise to new generation tissue and organ engineering, in the hope of one day designing 3D organs in vitro. While research in this field has been conducted for several decades, leading to the first synthetic trachea transplant in 2011, scaffold design for optimising complex tissue growth is still underexplored and underdeveloped. This is mostly the result of the complexity required in scaffolds, as they need to mimic the cells' native extracellular matrix. This is an intricate nanostructured environment that provides cells with physical and chemical stimuli for optimum cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. Carbon nanotubes are a popular addition to synthetic scaffolds and have already begun to revolutionise regenerative medicine. Discovered in 1991, these are traditionally used in various areas of engineering and technology; however, due to their excellent mechanical, chemical and electrical properties their potential is now being explored in areas of drug delivery, in vivo biosensor application and tissue engineering. The incorporation of CNTs into polymer scaffolds displays a variety of structural and chemical enhancements, some of which include: increased scaffold strength and flexibility, improved biocompatibility, reduction in cancerous cell division, induction of angiogenesis, reduced thrombosis, and manipulation of gene expression in developing cells. Moreover CNTs' tensile properties open doors for dynamic scaffold design, while their thermal and electrical properties provide opportunities for the development of neural, bone and cardiac tissue constructs. This review will provide an update on the use of CNTs in 3D organ generation.", "journal": "Biotechnology advances", "date": "2014-05-27", "authors": ["Erin LeighHopley", "ShimaSalmasi", "Deepak MKalaskar", "Alexander MSeifalian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.05.003"}

The apoptotic cell is not inevitably committed to death, and appropriate therapy like left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support could offer a rescue of cellular functions. Literature data regarding the modulation of the apoptotic process during LVAD support are still controversial.\nTo assess whether LVAD implantation modifies the apoptotic profile in the heart, cardiac tissue was collected from end-stage HF patients before LVAD implant (pre-LVAD, n=22) and at LVAD removal (post-LVAD, n=6) and from stable HF patients on medical therapy without prior circulatory support (HTx, n=7) at heart transplantation as control. Caspase (Casp)-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and Hsp72 cardiac mRNA and protein expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting (WB) in the three groups of patients. Immunohistochemical analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, and DNA laddering analysis were performed; cellular size and interstitial fibrosis content were also determined.\nAll the apoptotic indices were increased in the post-LVAD group compared to pre-LVAD, specially antiapoptotic Hsp72 and proapoptotic Bax (Hsp72: 3.27\u00b10.41 vs. 0.76\u00b10.14, P<.001; Bax: 2.15\u00b10.38 vs. 1.10 \u00b1 0.29, P=.035; post-LVAD vs. pre-LVAD, respectively). The significant increase in Hsp72 was confirmed by WB and immunohistochemical analysis.\nLVAD appears to induce an activation of apoptotic mediators, mainly at the mitochondrial level, while the following activation of Casp-3 is reduced by the significant increase of Hsp72, whose enhancement could be an important factor in cardiac remodeling associated with LVAD support.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2014-05-27", "authors": ["TommasoPrescimone", "SilviaMasotti", "AndreaD'Amico", "RaffaeleCaruso", "ManuelaCabiati", "ChiaraCaselli", "FedericaViglione", "AlessandroVerde", "SilviaDel Ry", "DanielaGiannessi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carpath.2014.04.003"}

This study showed that injectable hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels alone would effectively regenerate the damaged infarcted heart tissue. We found that there are two major factors of regeneration in MI. One is molecular weight of HA and another is the progression of MI; sub-acute and chronic. Rat MI model was prepared by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Four weeks after injection of hydrogel, functional analysis of the heart and histological analysis was assessed. When different molecular weight HA-based hydrogels with 50\u00a0kDa, 130\u00a0kDa, and 170\u00a0kDa were applied to the infarcted area in the sub-acute model, 50\u00a0kDa HA-based hydrogel showed the most significant regeneration of myocardium as well as functional recovery among samples. For the disease progression, 50\u00a0kDa HA-based hydrogels were injected to sub-acute and chronic MI models. The regeneration activity was significantly decreased in the chronic models reflecting that injection timing of the therapeutic agents is also major determinants in the regeneration process.

We devised a novel pacing system integrated in a setup for videooptical recording of EHT contractile function over time and investigated whether sustained electrical field stimulation improved EHT properties. EHTs were generated from neonatal rat heart cells (rEHT, n=96) or human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (hEHT, n=19). Pacing with biphasic pulses was initiated on day 4 of culture. REHT continuously paced for 16-18 days at 0.5Hz developed 2.2\u00d7 higher forces than nonstimulated rEHT. This was reflected by higher cardiomyocyte density in the center of EHTs, increased connexin-43 abundance as investigated by two-photon microscopy and remarkably improved sarcomere ultrastructure including regular M-bands. Further signs of tissue maturation include a rightward shift (to more physiological values) of the Ca(2+)-response curve, increased force response to isoprenaline and decreased spontaneous beating activity. Human EHTs stimulated at 2Hz in the first week and 1.5Hz thereafter developed 1.5\u00d7 higher forces than nonstimulated hEHT on day 14, an ameliorated muscular network of longitudinally oriented cardiomyocytes and a higher cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio. Taken together, continuous pacing improved structural and functional properties of rEHTs and hEHTs to an unprecedented level.

To test this hypothesis, six different groups were used (N\u200a=\u200a6 rats per group): control (12 h/12h light:dark); exposure to permanent illumination (24 h light); exposure to darkness (22 h dark); injected with adriamycin, 12h/12h light:dark; injected with adriamycin + exposure to permanent illumination and injected with adriamycin + exposure to darkness (22 h dark). The different photoperiods were begun two weeks prior to medication and were maintained up to the day of the animal's sacrifice, ten days after medication. The following parameters were analysed: i) weight evolution; ii) in plasma: urea, creatinine, uric acid, total proteins, albumen, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine-quinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and total cholesterol; iii) in urine: urea, creatinine, total proteins and microalbumen; iv) biomarkers of oxidative damage in kidneys, heart, liver and brain: lipoperoxides, total glutathione, reduced glutathione, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase; v) melatonin (pineal gland tissue and plasma) and leptin (plasma). From the results obtained it was concluded that the administration of adriamycin generated oxidative stress in renal, cerebral, hepatic and cardiac tissue. Additionally, in the healthy animal, but of a lesser relevance in the adriamycin animal, permanent light worsened the oxidative stress, whereas darkness improved it. This could be related to the circadian rhythm of the inverse release shown by melatonin and leptin, accentuating the release of melatonin in the darkness phase and that of leptin in the light phase. The correlation between melatonin and leptin in the healthy animal seemed to confirm the relationship between both variables and their influence on oxidative damage biomarkers.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-05-24", "authors": ["Bego\u00f1a MEscribano", "AntoniaD\u00edaz-Moreno", "InmaculadaTasset", "IsaacT\u00fanez"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0097713"}

With the matching dimensions of works produced by microfluidic technology, chemical engineering and biochemistry applications have used this technology extensively in cellular works. The 3D scaffolds produced in our investigation has essential properties, such has high mass transfer efficiency, and variable pore sizes, to adapt to various needs of different cell types. In addition to the malleability of these innovative scaffolds, fabrication procedure was effortless and fast. Primary neonatal mice cardiomyocytes were successfully harvested and cultured in 3D scaffolds made of gelatin and collagen. Gelatin and gelatin-collagen scaffold were produced by the formation of microbubbles through a microfluidic device, and the mechanical properties of gelatin scaffold and gelatin-collagen scaffold were measured. Cellular properties in the microbubbles were also monitored. Fluorescence staining results assured that cardiomyocytes could maintain in vivo morphology in 3D gelatin scaffold. In addition, it was found that 3D scaffold could prolong the contraction behavior of cardiomyocytes compared with a conventional 2D culture dish. Spontaneously contracted behavior was maintained for the longest (about 1 month) in the 3D gelatin scaffold, about 19 days in the 3D gelatin-collagen scaffold.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), with recombinant \u03b1-galactosidase A, is currently available for use to reduce GL-3 deposits.

Relevant models are needed to understand the pathogenesis of cardiac disease and explore new therapeutic approaches. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from Fabry patients and differentiated them into cardiomyocytes. In these cells, GL-3 accumulates in the lysosomes over time, resulting in phenotypic changes similar to those found in cardiac tissue from Fabry patients. Using this human in vitro model, we demonstrated that substrate reduction therapy via glucosylceramide synthase inhibition was able to prevent accumulation and to clear lysosomal GL-3 in cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Revision of the troponin T release mechanism from damaged human myocardium.", "abstract": "Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is released from damaged heart tissue in patients with acute myocardial infarction. It is presumed that most cTnT is tightly bound and released following the degradation of myofibrils in necrotic cardiomyocytes, resulting in sustained increases in circulating cTnT. Evidence of a large irreversibly bound fraction is based on the inability to extract most cTnT from cardiac tissue in cold low-salt extraction buffers.\nHere we examined in vitro extraction of cTnT from human cardiac tissue in serum at 37 \u00b0C.\nWe found that over 80% of the cTnT can be extracted from human cardiac tissue in 90 min using large volumes of human serum at 37 \u00b0C. The release ratio was highly dependent on the extraction volume and was only 3% if an equal volume of serum and heart tissue was used. In contrast, extraction of the cytoplasmic cardiac damage markers myoglobin and creatinine kinase was much less affected by changing these conditions. Purified cTnT was poorly soluble in a low-salt extraction buffer at 0 \u00b0C, previously used to define the free cTnT fraction.\nOur data indicate that the diffusible fraction of cTnT is likely substantially larger in vivo than previously reported and likely is not fixed but dependent on local plasma flow. It is therefore possible that the sustained increase in circulating cTnT after myocardial infarction is at least in part due to a slow washout of cTnT that interacts reversibly with tropomyosin in myofibrils.", "journal": "Clinical chemistry", "date": "2014-05-21", "authors": ["KarinStarnberg", "AndersJeppsson", "BertilLindahl", "OlaHammarsten"], "doi": "10.1373/clinchem.2013.217943"}

After modeling, the animals were anesthetized and blood samples collected. The concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. And the serum levels of such inflammatory factors as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and HMGB1 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cardiac tissues were harvested, fixed; hemotoxylin-eosin stained and observed under transmission electron microscopy. The histopathological cardiac changes were examined after hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the cardiac expressions of HMGB1 and Fas/FasL after HS/R. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to analyze the RNA levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 in cardiac tissues.

In the present study, the effect of chronic pre-treatment with metformin on cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activities following myocardial infarction and their relation with AMPK were assessed. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n=6): normal control and groups were injected isoproterenol after chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days. Isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. The left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg/kg of metformin. Metfromin markedly lowered isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the heart tissues. Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. However, the lower doses of 25 and 50mg/kg were more effective than 100mg/kg.

However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins. The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues.

LCFA lipotoxicity causes mitochondrial damage and results in an insufficient energy supply and a decrease in l-carnitine content limits LCFA flux and protects mitochondria. Here, we tested whether the inhibition of GBB dioxygenase (BBOX) or organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2) is the most effective strategy to decrease l-carnitine content. The activity of 51 compounds was tested and we identified selective inhibitors of OCTN2. In contrast to selective inhibitors of BBOX, OCTN2 inhibitors induced a 10-fold decrease in l-carnitine content in the heart tissues and a significant 35% reduction of myocardial infarct size. In addition, OCTN2 inhibition correlated with the inhibitor content in the heart tissues, and OCTN2 could potentially be an efficient target to increase drug transport into tissues and to reduce drug elimination by urine. In conclusion, the results of this study confirm that selective inhibition of OCTN2, compared to selective inhibition of BBOX, is a far more effective approach to decrease l-carnitine content and to induce cardioprotective effects.

Some evidence implicates reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a probable cause of myocardial injury in prooxidant clinical settings. Damage occurs during both ischemia and post-ischemic reperfusion in animal and human models. The mechanisms that contribute to this damage include the increase in cellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration and induction of ROS sources during reperfusion. Pharmacological preconditioning, which includes pharmacological strategies that counteract the ROS burst and Ca(2+) overload followed to IR cycle in the myocardium, could be effective in limiting injury. Currently widespread evidence supports the use of anesthetics agents as an important cardioprotective strategy that act at various levels such as metabotropic receptors, ion channels or mitochondrial level. Their administration before a prolonged ischemic episode is known as anesthetic preconditioning, whereas when given at the very onset of reperfusion, is termed anesthetic postconditioning.

This study sought to determine whether early intramyocardial injection of alginate-chitosan could prevent left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI), leading to a more favorable course of tissue restoration. In a rat model of acute MI, local injection of alginate-chitosan hydrogel into the peri-infarct zone preserved scar thickness, attenuated infarct expansion, and reduced scar fibrosis after 8 weeks, concomitantly with promoting increased angiogenesis and greater recruitment of endogenous repair at the infarct zone. Furthermore, this treatment prevented cell apoptosis, induced cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry. The cardiac function of the control-injected animals deteriorated over the 8-week course, while that of the hydrogel-injected animals did not.In addition, the hydrogel did not exacerbate inflammation in the heart. Intramyocardial injection of alginate-chitosan hydrogel represents a useful strategy to treat MI. It demonstrated marked therapeutic efficacies on various tissue levels after extensive MI, as well as potential to induce endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation and recruit cardiac stem cells.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Additionally, the gender differences in cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy were analyzed. The genetic background may affect the myocardial response to pressure overload. In human cardiac tissue, CMA1 is involved in angiotensin II production and TGF-\u03b2 activation, which are two major players in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy and fibrosis. Preoperative echocardiographic data from 648 patients with significant symptomatic AS were used. The LVM/BSA was significantly lower (p<0.0001), but relative wall thickness (RWT) was significantly higher (p = 0.0009) in the women compared with the men. The haplotypes were reconstructed using six genotyped polymorphisms: rs5248, rs4519248, rs1956932, rs17184822, rs1956923, and rs1800875. The haplotype h1.ACAGGA was associated with higher LVM/BSA (p = 9.84 \u00d7 10(-5)), and the haplotype h2.ATAGAG was associated with lower LVM/BSA (p = 0.0061) in men, and no significant differences were found in women. Two polymorphisms within the promoter region of the CMA1 gene, namely rs1800875 (p = 0.0067) and rs1956923 (p = 0.0015), influenced the value of the LVM/BSA in males.

This cell death is caused by Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) interactions under harsh conditions. To investigate improving the survival and therapeutic effects of MSCs, we focused our research on Fas-FasL-mediated cell death. In this study, we found that the poor viability of transplanted MSCs was caused by Fas-FasL interactions between host ischemic myocardial cells and implanted MSCs. In addition, we found that increased Fas expression and the corresponding decrease of cell survival were in close relation to hypoxic MSCs treated with FasL and H2O2. When MSCs were treated with a recombinant Fas/Fc chimera (Fas/Fc) inhibiting Fas-FasL interactions, the expressions of proapoptotic proteins including caspase-8, caspase-3, Bax, and cytochrome-c were attenuated, and the survival of MSCs was recovered. In ischemia-reperfusion injury models, the interaction between FasL in ischemic heart and Fas in implanted MSCs caused a loss of transplanted MSCs, whereas the inhibition of this interaction by Fas/Fc treatment improved cell survival and restored heart function. Thus, our study suggests that Fas-FasL interactions are responsible for activating cell death signaling in implanted stem cells and could be a potential target for improving therapeutic efficacy of stem cells in treating ischemic heart diseases.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2014-05-16", "authors": ["OnjuHam", "Se-YeonLee", "Byeong-WookSong", "Min-JiCha", "Chang YounLee", "Jun-HeePark", "Il-KwonKim", "JiyunLee", "Hyang-HeeSeo", "Min-JiSeung", "EunhyunChoi", "YangsooJang", "Ki-ChulHwang"], "doi": "10.3727/096368914X681748"}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous group of cells in culture, with multipotent and hypoimmunogenic characters to aid tissue repair and avoid immune responses, respectively. Numerous experimental findings have proven the feasibility, safety, and efficiency of MSC therapy for cardiac regeneration. Despite that the exact mechanism remains unclear, the therapeutic ability of MSCs to treat ischemia heart diseases has been tested in phase I/II clinical trials. Based on encouraging preliminary findings, MSCs might become a potentially efficacious tool in the therapeutic options available to treat ischemic and nonischemic cardiovascular disorders. The molecular mechanism behind the efficacy of MSCs on promoting engraftment and accelerating the speed of heart functional recovery is still waiting for clarification. It is hypothesized that cardiomyocyte regeneration, paracrine mechanisms for cardiac repair, optimization of the niche for cell survival, and cardiac remodeling by inflammatory control are involved in the interaction between MSCs and the damaged myocardial environment. This review focuses on recent experimental and clinical findings related to cellular cardiomyoplasticity.

Serum was analyzed for cardiac specific injury biomarkers, lipids and lipoprotein content.

Exploration of the underlying mechanisms of embelin action revealed that embelin pretreatment restored the myocardial mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities (NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial redox activity), strengthened antioxidant status and attenuated ISO-induced myocardial lipid peroxidation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that embelin interrupted mitochondria dependent apoptotic damage by increasing the myocardial expression of Bcl-2 and downregulating the expression of Bax, cytochrome c, cleaved-caspase-3 & 9 and PARP.

However, residual influence of the somatic origin or reprogramming technique may variegate differentiation propensity and confound comparative genotype/phenotype analyses. The objective of this study was to define quality control measures to select iPSC clones that minimize the influence of somatic origin on differentiation propensity independent of the reprogramming strategy. More than 60 murine iPSC lines were derived from different fibroblast origins (embryonic, cardiac, and tail tip) via lentiviral integration and doxycycline-induced transgene expression. Despite apparent equivalency according to established iPSC histologic and cytomorphologic criteria, clustering of clonal variability in pluripotency-related gene expression identified transcriptional outliers that highlighted cell lines with unpredictable cardiogenic propensity. Following selection according to a standardized gene expression profile calibrated by embryonic stem cells, the influence of somatic origin on iPSC methylation and transcriptional patterns was negated. Furthermore, doxycycline-induced iPSCs consistently demonstrated earlier differentiation than lentiviral-reprogrammed lines using contractile cardiac tissue as a measure of functional differentiation. Moreover, delayed cardiac differentiation was predominately associated with upregulation in pluripotency-related gene expression upon differentiation. Starting from a standardized pool of iPSCs, relative expression levels of two pluripotency genes, Oct4 and Zfp42, statistically correlated with enhanced cardiogenicity independent of somatic origin or reprogramming strategy (R(2) \u2009=\u20090.85).

However, it is difficult to distinguish cardiomyocytes in the regenerating stage from binucleated or multinucleated myocytes by conventional morphometric techniques. As cell cycle progression (CCP) scores have been successfully applied to the evaluation of the proliferation of cancer cells, we sought to establish a multi-gene score to evaluate cardiomyocyte proliferation in this study. Given the disturbances of nuclear division without cell division that occurs in cardiomyocytes, ten cytokinesis-correlated genes (Anln, Aurkb, Cenpa, Kif4, Kif23, Prc1, RhoA, Spin1, TACC2, and CDC42) were chosen to establish the cardiomyocyte cytokinesis score (CC-Score). The expression levels of these genes in H9C2 rat cardiomyoblast cells, the proliferation of which were stimulated or inhibited, were detected using qRT-PCR. To confirm the feasibility of the CC-Score system, four conventional methods for evaluating cardiomyocyte proliferation, including the MTT assay, BrdU assay, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry analysis, were used in each group. The results of the CC-Score in the assessment of the proliferation of H9C2 cells were consistent with those of four commonly used proliferative assay methods. We conclude that the CC-Score can be used to assess the proliferation status of H9C2 cells, and suggest that the CC-Score may be a potential method for the assessment of cardiomyocyte proliferation in myocardial regeneration.

{"title": "Towards computational modelling of the human foetal electrocardiogram: normal sinus rhythm and congenital heart block.", "abstract": "We aim to engineer a computational model of propagation during normal sinus rhythm in the foetal human heart, by modifying models for adult cardiac tissue to match foetal electrocardiogram (fECG) characteristics. The model will be partially validated by fECG data, and applied to explore possible mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in the foetal heart.\nFoetal electrocardiograms have been recorded during pregnancy, with P- and T-waves, and the QRS complex, identified by averaging and signal processing. Intervals of the fECG are extracted and used to modify currently available human adult cardiomyocyte models. RR intervals inform models of the pacemaking cells by constraining their rate, the QT interval and its rate dependence constrain models of ventricular cells, and the width of the P-wave, the QR and PR intervals constrain propagation times, conduction velocities, and intercellular coupling. These cell models are coupled into a one-dimensional (1D) model of propagation during normal sinus rhythm in the human foetal heart. We constructed a modular, heterogeneous 1D model for propagation in the foetal heart, and predicted the effects of reduction in L-type Ca(++) current. These include bradycardia and atrioventricular conduction blocks. These may account quantitatively for congenital heart block produced by positive IgG antibodies.\nThe fECG can be interpreted mechanistically and quantitatively by using a simple computational model for propagation. After further validation, by clinical recordings of the fECG and the electrophysiological experiments on foetal cardiac cells and tissues, the model may be used to predict the effects of maternally administered pharmaceuticals on the fECG.", "journal": "Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "date": "2014-05-07", "authors": ["EleftheriaPervolaraki", "SamHodgson", "Arun VHolden", "Alan PBenson"], "doi": "10.1093/europace/eut377"}

{"title": "Tuning composition and architecture of biomimetic scaffolds for enhanced matrix synthesis by murine cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "A major onset of heart failure is myocardial infarction, which causes the myocardium to lose cardiomyocytes and transform into a scar tissue. Since mammalian infarcted cardiac tissue has a limited ability to regenerate, alternative strategies including implantation of tissue-engineered scaffolds at the site of damaged myocardium have been explored. The goal is to enable in situ cardiac reconstruction at the injured myocardium site, replace the lost cardiomyocytes, deliver the required biomolecules, and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM synthesis and deposition by cardiomyocytes within such scaffolds remains categorically unexplored. Here, we investigated the survival, ECM synthesis and deposition, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) release by cardiomyocytes within three-dimensional (3D) substrates. Rat cardiomyocytes were cultured for three weeks within two structurally different substrates: 3D collagen hydrogels or polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous scaffolds. The concentration and composition of the hydrogels was varied, while PCL nanofibers were surface-modified with various ECM proteins. Results showed that myocyte attachment and survival was higher within collagen hydrogels, while myocyte alignment and beating was noted only within PCL scaffolds. Total protein synthesis by myocytes within PCL scaffolds was significantly higher compared to that within collagen hydrogels, although more protein was deposited as matrix within hydrogels. Significant ECM synthesis and matrix deposition, TIMP-1, and MMP release were noted within modified collagen hydrogels and PCL nanofiber scaffolds. These results were qualitatively confirmed by imaging techniques. Results attest to the prominent role of scaffold composition and architecture in influencing cardiomyocyte phenotype, matrix synthesis and cytokines release, with significant applications in cardiac tissue remodeling strategies.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Chronic rejection, represented by allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and cardiac interstitial fibrosis (CIF) is known to cause severe long-term complications. Rejection associated tissue-remodelling entails the reoccurrence of fetal variants of Fibronectin (Fn) and Tenascin-C (Tn-C), which are virtually absent in adult human organs. In a rat model, an extensive re-expression could be demonstrated for ED-A(+) Fn with spatial association to CAV and CIF. Thus, it is of great interest to investigate the cardiac tissue expression and distribution in human samples. From 48 heart transplanted patients, 64 tissue specimens derived from right ventricular biopsies were available. Histopathological analysis was performed according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the detection of acute rejection. By immunohistochemistry, protein expression of ED-A(+) Fn, B(+) Tn-C, alpha-smooth muscle actin, CD31 and CD45 was assessed and analysed semiquantitatively. Co-localisation studies were performed by means of immunofluorescence double labelling. Histopathological analysis of the 64 samples revealed different ISHLT grades (0R in 36 cases, 1R in 20 cases and 2R in 8 cases). There was a distinct and quantitatively relevant re-occurrence of ED-A(+) Fn and B(+) Tn-C in most samples. Semi-quantitative evaluation did not show any correlation to the acute rejection grade for all markers. Interestingly, significant correlations to the extent of inflammation could be shown for ED-A(+) Fn (r\u00a0=\u00a00.442, p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) and B(+) Tn-C (r\u00a0=\u00a00.408, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) as well as between both proteins (r\u00a0=\u00a00.663, p\u00a0=\u00a00.000). A spatial association of ED-A(+) Fn and B(+) Tn-C to CAV and CIF could be demonstrated. A relevant re-occurrence of ED-A(+) Fn and B(+) Tn-C following human heart transplantation could be demonstrated with spatial association to signs of rejection and a significant correlation to tissue inflammation.

The purpose of this study was to examine the role of dye affinity in Cai(2+) measurements in intact adult cardiac tissue by comparing optical recordings obtained with high- and low-affinity dyes. Experiments were carried out in porcine left ventricular (LV) wedge preparations stained locally by intramural injection via microcapillaries (diameter = 150 \u03bcm) with a low-affinity Ca(2+)-sensitive dye Fluo-4FF or Fluo-2LA (nominal Kd, ~7-10 \u03bcmol/l), high-affinity dye Rhod-2 (Kd = 0.57 \u03bcmol/l), and Fluo-4 or Fluo-2MA (Kd, ~0.4 \u03bcmol/l); in addition, tissue was stained with transmembrane potential (Vm)-sensitive dye RH-237. Optical recordings of Vm and Cai(2+) were made using optical fibers (diameter = 325 \u03bcm) glued with the microcapillaries. The durations of Cai(2+) transients measured at 50% level of recovery (CaD50) using high-affinity Fluo-4/Fluo-2MA dyes were up to ~81% longer than those measured with low-affinity Fluo-4FF/Fluo-2LA at long pacing cycle lengths (CL). In Fluo-4/Fluo-2MA measurements at long CLs, Cai(2+) transients often (~50% of cases) exhibited slow upstroke rise and extended plateau. In Rhod-2 measurements, CaD50 was moderately longer (up to ~35%) than in Fluo-4FF recordings, but Cai(2+) transient shapes were similar. In all series of measurements, mean action potential duration values were not significantly different (P > 0.05). The delays between Vm and Cai(2+) upstrokes were comparable for low- and high-affinity dyes (P > 0.05).

Since GATA4 is a critical regulator of cardiac differentiation, we examined the molecular basis underlying the early activation of GATA4 gene expression during cardiac differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Our studies demonstrate the direct involvement of histone acetylation and transcriptional coactivator p300 in the regulation of GATA4 gene expression.

During 26 days, animals received T3 (2 \u03bcg/100g/day) and T4 (8 \u03bcg/100g/day) by gavage. Echocardiographic parameters were assessed and heart tissue was collected to biochemical analysis. AMIT rats presented absence of lung congestion, less cardiac dilatation, and normalization in myocardial performance index, compared with AMI. AMI rats presented an increase in hydrogen peroxide levels and in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in GSH/GSSG. TH prevented these alterations in AMIT.

Viral diagnostics are increasingly used in forensic medicine, but the interpretation of the results can sometimes be challenging. In this study, we examined the prevalence of adenovirus, enterovirus, and parvovirus B19 (PVB) in myocardial autopsy samples from myocarditis related deaths and in non-inflamed control hearts in an effort to clarify their significance as the causes of myocarditis in a forensic material.\nWe collected all autopsy cases diagnosed with myocarditis from 1992 to 2010. Eighty-four suicidal deaths with morphologically normal hearts served as controls. Polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of the viral genomes (adenovirus, enterovirus, and PVB) in myocardial tissue specimens. The distinction between acute and persistent PVB infection was made by the serological determination of PVB-specific immunoglobulins M and G.\nPVB was detected in 33 of 112 (29\u00a0%) myocarditis cases and 37 of 84 (44\u00a0%) control cases. All of the samples were negative for the presence of adenovirus and enterovirus. Serological evidence of an acute PVB infection, determined by the presence of immunoglobulin M, was only present in one case. In the remaining cases, PVB was considered to be a bystander with no or limited association to myocardial inflammation.\nIn this study, adenovirus, enterovirus, and PVB were found to be rare causes of myocarditis. The detection of PVB in myocardial autopsy samples most likely represents a persistent infection with no or limited association with myocardial inflammation.

{"title": "Physiological and structural differences in spatially distinct subpopulations of cardiac mitochondria: influence of cardiac pathologies.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue contains discrete pools of mitochondria that are characterized by their subcellular spatial arrangement. Subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) exist below the cell membrane, interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) reside in rows between the myofibrils, and perinuclear mitochondria are situated at the nuclear poles. Microstructural imaging of heart tissue coupled with the development of differential isolation techniques designed to sequentially separate spatially distinct mitochondrial subpopulations have revealed differences in morphological features including shape, absolute size, and internal cristae arrangement. These findings have been complemented by functional studies indicating differences in biochemical parameters and, potentially, functional roles for the ATP generated, based upon subcellular location. Consequently, mitochondrial subpopulations appear to be influenced differently during cardiac pathologies including ischemia/reperfusion, heart failure, aging, exercise, and diabetes mellitus. These influences may be the result of specific structural and functional disparities between mitochondrial subpopulations such that the stress elicited by a given cardiac insult differentially impacts subcellular locales and the mitochondria contained within. The goal of this review is to highlight some of the inherent structural and functional differences that exist between spatially distinct cardiac mitochondrial subpopulations as well as provide an overview of the differential impact of various cardiac pathologies on spatially distinct mitochondrial subpopulations. As an outcome, we will instill a basis for incorporating subcellular spatial location when evaluating the impact of cardiac pathologies on the mitochondrion.

A similar protocol was used in a simplified computer model of the cardiac tachycardia circuit in a 2-dimensional tissue strip using a Fenton-Karma model of cardiac tissue. In vivo, in the case of fast tachycardias (<350 ms), PPI-TCL variability observed was doubled compared with slow tachycardias (>350 ms; 95% Limits of Agreement ranged from -21.4 to 21.6 ms for TCL<350 ms and from -10.8 to 11.5 ms for TCL>350 ms).

{"title": "Cardiac differentiation of cardiosphere-derived cells in scaffolds mimicking morphology of the cardiac extracellular matrix.", "abstract": "Stem cell therapy has the potential to regenerate heart tissue after myocardial infarction (MI). The regeneration is dependent upon cardiac differentiation of the delivered stem cells. We hypothesized that timing of the stem cell delivery determines the extent of cardiac differentiation as cell differentiation is dependent on matrix properties such as biomechanics, structure and morphology, and these properties in cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) continuously vary with time after MI. In order to elucidate the relationship between ECM properties and cardiac differentiation, we created an in vitro model based on ECM-mimicking fibers and a type of cardiac progenitor cell, cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs). A simultaneous fiber electrospinning and cell electrospraying technique was utilized to fabricate constructs. By blending a highly soft hydrogel with a relatively stiff polyurethane and modulating fabrication parameters, tissue constructs with similar cell adhesion property but different global modulus, single fiber modulus, fiber density and fiber alignment were achieved. The CDCs remained alive within the constructs during a 1week culture period. CDC cardiac differentiation was dependent on the scaffold modulus, fiber volume fraction and fiber alignment. Two constructs with relatively low scaffold modulus, \u223c50-60kPa, most significantly directed the CDC differentiation into mature cardiomyocytes as evidenced by gene expressions of cardiac troponin T (cTnT), calcium channel (CACNA1c) and cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH6), and protein expressions of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and connexin 43 (CX43). Of these two low-modulus constructs, the extent of differentiation was greater for lower fiber alignment and higher fiber volume fraction.

More recent clinical investigations of patients with diseases such as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy have further highlighted the importance of desmosomes in cardiac tissue, where they help to maintain coordination of cardiac myocytes. Here, we review clinical and mechanistic studies that provide insight into the functions of desmosomal proteins in skin and heart during homeostasis and in disease. While intercellular junctions are organized differently in cardiac and epithelial tissues, studies conducted in epithelial systems may inform our understanding of cardiac desmosomes. We explore traditional and non-traditional roles of desmosomal proteins, ranging from adhesive capacities to nuclear functions. Finally, we discuss how these studies can guide future investigations focused on determining the molecular mechanisms by which desmosomal mutations promote the development of cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Cell communication & adhesion", "date": "2014-04-24", "authors": ["Dipal MPatel", "Kathleen JGreen"], "doi": "10.3109/15419061.2014.906533"}

After PNx, both WT and \u03b11(+/-) animals displayed diastolic dimension increases, increased blood pressure, and increased cardiac hypertrophy. However, in the \u03b11(+/-) animals we detected significant increases in cardiac cell death in PNx animals. Given that reduction of \u03b11 elicited increased cardiac cell death with PNx, while at the same time these animals developed cardiac hypertrophy, an examination of cardiac cell number, and proliferative capabilities of those cells was carried out. Cardiac tissues were probed for the progenitor cell marker c-kit and the proliferation marker ki-67. The results revealed that \u03b11(+/-) mice had significantly higher numbers of c-kit-positive and ki-67-positive cells, especially in the PNx group. We also found that \u03b11(+/-) mice express higher levels of stem cell factor, a c-kit ligand, in their heart tissue and had higher circulating levels of stem cell factor than WT animals. In addition, PNx induced significant enlargement of cardiac myocytes in WT mice but has much less effect in \u03b11(+/-) mice. However, the total cell number determined by nuclear counting is higher in \u03b11(+/-) mice with PNx compared with WT mice.

Previous research has documented the molecular coupling of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels) to VDCCs in mouse cardiac muscle. Little is known regarding the role of RyRs-sensitive Ca2+ release in the SK channels in cardiac muscle. In this study, using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, we observed that a Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK,Ca) recorded from isolated adult C57B/L mouse atrial myocytes was significantly decreased by ryanodine, an inhibitor of ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2), or by the co-application of ryanodine and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively). The activation of RyR2 by caffeine increased the IK,Ca in the cardiac cells (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively). We further analyzed the effect of RyR2 knockdown on IK,Ca and Ca2+ in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes using a whole-cell patch clamp technique and confocal imaging. RyR2 knockdown in mouse atrial cells transduced with lentivirus-mediated small hairpin interference RNA (shRNA) exhibited a significant decrease in IK,Ca (p<0.05) and [Ca2+]i fluorescence intensity (p<0.01).

Based on a functional genomic evaluation of obesity-associated cardiac gene expression, we previously identified and cloned the gene encoding apolipoprotein O (APOO), which is overexpressed in hearts from diabetic patients. Here, we generated APOO-Tg mice, transgenic mouse lines that expresses physiological levels of human APOO in heart tissue. APOO-Tg mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited depressed ventricular function with reduced fractional shortening and ejection fraction, and myocardial sections from APOO-Tg mice revealed mitochondrial degenerative changes. In vivo fluorescent labeling and subcellular fractionation revealed that APOO localizes with mitochondria. Furthermore, APOO enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling and respiration, both of which were reduced by deletion of the N-terminus and by targeted knockdown of APOO. Consequently, fatty acid metabolism and ROS production were enhanced, leading to increased AMPK phosphorylation and Ppara and Pgc1a expression. Finally, we demonstrated that the APOO-induced cascade of events generates a mitochondrial metabolic sink whereby accumulation of lipotoxic byproducts leads to lipoapoptosis, loss of cardiac cells, and cardiomyopathy, mimicking the diabetic heart-associated metabolic phenotypes.

Despite some success, traditional anticancer drugs developed to reduce tumor growth face important limitations primarily due to undesirable bone marrow and cardiovascular toxicity. Many drugs fail in clinical development after showing promise in preclinical trials, suggesting that the available in vitro and animal models are poor predictors of drug efficacy and toxicity in humans. Thus, novel models that more accurately mimic the biology of human organs are necessary for high-throughput drug screening. Three-dimensional (3D) microphysiological systems can utilize induced pluripotent stem cell technology, tissue engineering, and microfabrication techniques to develop tissue models of human tumors, cardiac muscle, and bone marrow on the order of 1\u2009mm(3) in size. A functional network of human capillaries and microvessels to overcome diffusion limitations in nutrient delivery and waste removal can also nourish the 3D microphysiological tissues. Importantly, the 3D microphysiological tissues are grown on optically clear platforms that offer non-invasive and non-destructive image acquisition with subcellular resolution in real time.

Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), an antiulcer agent used in Japan for 30 years, has no significant adverse effects, and unexpectedly reduces ovarian cancer progression in mice. Because GGA reduces oxidative stress in brain and heart, we hypothesized that GGA would prevent oxidative stress of doxorubicin cardiac toxicity and improve doxorubicin's chemotherapeutic effects. Nude mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were studied after chronic treatment with doxorubicin, doxorubicin/GGA, GGA, or saline. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to monitor systolic heart function and xenografts evaluated. Mice were euthanized and cardiac tissue evaluated for reactive oxygen species generation, TUNEL assay, and RHO/ROCK pathway analysis. Tumor metastases were evaluated in lung sections. In vitro studies using Boyden chambers were performed to evaluate GGA effects on RHO pathway activator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced motility and invasion. We found that GGA reduced doxorubicin cardiac toxicity, preserved cardiac function, prevented TUNEL-positive cardiac cell death, and reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidant production in a nitric oxide synthase-dependent and independent manner. GGA also reduced heart doxorubicin-induced ROCK1 cleavage. Remarkably, in xenograft-implanted mice, combined GGA/doxorubicin treatment decreased tumor growth more effectively than doxorubicin treatment alone. As evidence of antitumor effect, GGA inhibited LPA-induced motility and invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells.

Delivery of DOX by particulate carriers can be an effective way to reduce its distribution in cardiac tissue. In the present study, we developed a self-assembled, tumor-microenvironment-responsive delivery system for DOX. The core of the carrier was built upon the DOX/DNA intercalation, which was further combined with cationic gelatin (C-gel) to form the complex GDD. GDD was then packaged into a complex, namely, HDD, based on the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged C-gel and negatively charged human serum albumin (HSA). The HSA molecules on the surface of the complex HDD effectively helped the particle evade the filtration of the body when injected into the circulation and passively accumulate into the tumor sites. After entering the tumor tissue, where albumin is rapidly consumed, GDD was release from HDD and the C-gel was then digested by the tumor-specific matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) to free the DOX/DNA intercalation. Deoxyribonucleases (DNases) in the tissue could completely destroy the DNA molecules to release DOX into the microenvironments. After a series of in vitro optimization tests, we evaluated the anticancer capacity and cardiac toxicity of HDD in two animal models with cancer.

Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes adhered to gelatin hydrogels and formed aligned tissues as defined by the microgrooves. Cardiac tissues could be cultured for over three weeks without declines in contractile stress. Myocytes on gelatin had higher spare respiratory capacity compared to those on fibronectin-coated PDMS, suggesting that improved metabolic function could be contributing to extended culture lifetime. Lastly, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes adhered to micromolded gelatin surfaces and formed aligned tissues that remained functional for four weeks, highlighting their potential for human-relevant chronic studies.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-04-16", "authors": ["Megan LMcCain", "AshutoshAgarwal", "Haley WNesmith", "Alexander PNesmith", "Kevin KitParker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.052"}

Group A had the ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery while group B underwent a sham operation. Electrocardiogram was used to assess whether the operation was successful or not. Three days after surgery, 10 animals of each group were sacrificed and the serum level of CXCL16 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Twenty-eight days after surgery, cardiac function of the remaining mice was measured by small animal ultrasound. Then the animals were sacrificed. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical staining of cardiac paraffin section were used to observe the inflammation and detect the expression of CXCL16 in cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction. To explore the function of CXCL16 in vitro, primary murine monocytes were separated from bone marrow, cultured to differentiate into macrophages and transfected with adenovirus vectors over-expressing CXCL16 or control adenovirus vectors. After stimulation by debris of cardiac cells, the phagocytic uptake by macrophages was evaluated by flow cytometry.\nThe model of myocardial infarction was successfully established. ELISA showed that the serum level of CXCL16 was elevated 3 days after myocardial infarction [(1 079 \u00b1 176) vs (611 \u00b1 37) pg/ml, P = 0.032]. HE and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the infiltration of macrophages increased during an early stage of myocardial infarction and decreased at the late stage. The CXCL16 level was up-regulated 3 days after myocardial infarction and returned to normal level at Day 28. Furthermore, macrophages transfected with adenovirus over-expressing CXCL16 showed stronger phagocytic activity compared with control (17.11% \u00b1 0.87% vs 7.91% \u00b1 0.71%, P < 0.01).\nCXCL16 is up-regulated after myocardial infarction in mice.

To overcome this limitation, implantable resonators, having a small (0.5 mm diameter) sensory loop containing the oxygen-sensing paramagnetic material connected by a pair of twisted copper wire to a coupling loop (8-10 mm diameter), have been developed, which enable repeated measurements of deep-tissue oxygen levels (pO2, partial pressure of oxygen) in the brain and tumors of rodents. In this study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring dynamic changes in pO2 in the heart and lung of rats using deep-tissue implantable oxygen sensors. The sensory loop of the resonator contained lithium octa-n-butoxynaphthalocyanine (LiNc-BuO) crystals embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer and was implanted in the myocardial tissue or lung pleura. The external coupling loop was secured subcutaneously above chest. The rats were exposed to different breathing gas mixtures while undergoing EPR measurements.

However, it remains uncertain whether Grx2 is required to control mitochondrial ATP output in heart. Here, we report that Grx2 plays a vital role modulating mitochondrial energetics and heart physiology by mediating the deglutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins. Deletion of Grx2 (Grx2(-/-)) decreased ATP production by complex I-linked substrates to half that in wild type (WT) mitochondria. Decreased respiration was associated with increased complex I glutathionylation diminishing its activity. Tissue glucose uptake was concomitantly increased. Mitochondrial ATP output and complex I activity could be recovered by restoring the redox environment to that favoring the deglutathionylated states of proteins. Grx2(-/-) hearts also developed left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, and mice became hypertensive. Mitochondrial energetics from Grx2 heterozygotes (Grx2(+/-)) were also dysfunctional, and hearts were hypertrophic. Intriguingly, Grx2(+/-) mice were far less hypertensive than Grx2(-/-) mice. Thus, Grx2 plays a vital role in modulating mitochondrial metabolism in cardiac muscle, and Grx2 deficiency leads to pathology. As mitochondrial ATP production was restored by the addition of reductants, these findings may be relevant to novel redox-related therapies in cardiac disease.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2014-04-15", "authors": ["Ryan JMailloux", "Jian YingXuan", "SkyeMcBride", "WaelMaharsy", "StephanieThorn", "Chet EHolterman", "Christopher R JKennedy", "PeterRippstein", "RobertdeKemp", "Jeanda Silva", "MonaNemer", "MarjorieLou", "Mary-EllenHarper"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M114.550574\n10.1016/j.bbapap.2014.02.006"}

In the present study, we explored the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (Mkk4), a critical component of the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase family, in age-associated AF.\nWe developed a novel mouse model with a selective inactivation of atrial cardiomyocyte Mkk4 (Mkk4(ACKO)). We characterized and compared electrophysiological, histological, and molecular features of young (3- to 4-month), adult (6-month), and old (1-year) Mkk4(ACKO) mice with age-matched control littermates (Mkk4(F/F)). Aging Mkk4(ACKO) mice were more susceptible to atrial tachyarrhythmias than the corresponding Mkk4(F/F) mice, showing characteristic slow and dispersed atrial conduction, for which modeling studies demonstrated potential arrhythmic effects. These differences paralleled increased interstitial fibrosis, upregulated transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) signaling and dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinases in Mkk4(ACKO), compared to Mkk4(F/F), atria. Mkk4 inactivation increased the sensitivity of cultured cardiomyocytes to angiotensin II-induced activation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling. This, in turn, enhanced expression of profibrotic molecules in cultured cardiac fibroblasts, suggesting cross-talk between these two cell types in profibrotic signaling. Finally, human atrial tissues in AF showed a Mkk4 downregulation associated with increased production of profibrotic molecules, compared to findings in tissue from control subjects in sinus rhythm.\nThese findings together demonstrate, for the first time, that Mkk4 is a negative regulator of the TGF-\u03b21 signaling associated with atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenesis with age, establishing Mkk4 as a new potential therapeutic target for treating AF.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2014-04-12", "authors": ["LauraDavies", "JiaweiJin", "WeijinShen", "HoyeeTsui", "YingShi", "YanwenWang", "YanminZhang", "GuoliangHao", "JingjingWu", "SiChen", "James AFraser", "NianguoDong", "VincentChristoffels", "UrsulaRavens", "Christopher L-HHuang", "HengguiZhang", "Elizabeth JCartwright", "XinWang", "MingLei"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.113.000340"}

The cytotoxicity of DOX-hyd-LNA on HUVECs was lower than that of DOX. DOX-hyd-LNA released significantly more DOX in pH 5.0 medium than it did in pH 7.4 medium.

However, up to 30% of the patients treated with doxorubicin suffer from congestive heart failure. The mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is likely multifactorial and most importantly, the genetic factors predisposing to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity are unknown. On the basis of the fact that mtDNA lesions and mitochondrial dysfunctions have been found in human hearts exposed to doxorubicin and that mitochondrial topoisomerase 1 (Top1mt) specifically controls mtDNA homeostasis, we hypothesized that Top1mt knockout (KO) mice might exhibit hypersensitivity to doxorubicin.\nWild-type (WT) and KO Top1mt mice were treated once a week with 4 mg/kg doxorubicin for 8 weeks. Heart tissues were analyzed one week after the last treatment.\nGenetic inactivation of Top1mt in mice accentuates mtDNA copy number loss and mtDNA damage in heart tissue following doxorubicin treatment. Top1mt KO mice also fail to maintain respiratory chain protein production and mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure organization. These mitochondrial defects result in decreased O2 consumption, increased reactive oxygen species production, and enhanced heart muscle damage in animals treated with doxorubicin. Accordingly, Top1mt KO mice die within 45 days after the last doxorubicin injection, whereas the WT mice survive.\nOur results provide evidence that Top1mt, which is conserved across vertebrates, is critical for cardiac tolerance to doxorubicin and adaptive response to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. They also suggest the potential of Top1mt single-nucleotide polymorphisms testing to investigate patient susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2014-04-10", "authors": ["SalimKhiati", "IlariaDalla Rosa", "CaroleSourbier", "XuefeiMa", "V AshutoshRao", "Leonard MNeckers", "HongliangZhang", "YvesPommier"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3373"}

However little is known about the impact on the myocardial proteome. We therefore investigated proteome dynamics at different experimental time points of a preconditioning protocol.\nUsing an in vivo rat model of desflurane-induced preconditioning (DES-PC) cardiac tissue proteomes were analysed by a gel-based comparative approach. Treatment-dependent protein alterations were assessed by intra-group comparisons. Proteins were identified by mass-spectrometry.\nA total of 40 protein spots were altered during the 30-minutes lasting preconditioning protocol. None of the proteins was differentially regulated consistently at all experimental time points. Interestingly, 1) the repeated administration of desflurane mostly accounted for proteome alterations during DES-PC, 2) the majority of altered protein species showed a decrease in abundance, 3) these changes primarily affected metabolic proteins involved in NADH/NAD(+) redox balance, calcium homeostasis and acidosis and 4) protein alterations were not exclusively due to expression changes but also represented modifications of specific protein isoforms.\nDES-PC evokes dynamic alterations in the cardiac proteome which substantiate a tight regulation of bioenergetic proteins.

It has been shown that emulsified GT3, after subcutaneous administration, has long-term biological effects. However, whether the effects are due to the increase of GT3 level in the early phase following administration or the persistent functions after accumulation in tissues is unknown. This study was conducted to determine the levels of GT3 in different tissues by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector after a single-dose of GT3 with polyethylene glycol (PEG-400) emulsion via subcutaneous injection. Previous studies have explored that GT3 has favorable effects on bone and can inhibit osteoclast formation. To confirm the persistent biological activity of accumulated GT3 in tissues, receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) gene expressions, which have an important role in regulating osteoclast formation, were also evaluated in bone tissue on day 1, 3, 7 and 14 after a signal subcutaneous injection of GT3.\nC57BL/6 female mice were administrated GT3 (100 mg/kg body weight) with PEG-400 emulsion by subcutaneous injection. GT3 levels in different tissues were determined by HPLC with a fluorescence detector. Gene expressions were measured by real-time PCR.\nGT3 predominantly accumulated in adipose and heart tissue, and was maintained at a relatively stable level in bone tissues after a single-dose administration. Accumulated GT3 in bone tissues significantly inhibited the increase in RANKL expression and the decrease in OPG expression induced by db-cAMP.\nWe investigated the tissue distribution of GT3 with PEG emulsion by subcutaneous administration, which has never been reported so far.

Microarray analysis of cardiac tissue exposed to systemic angiotensin II infusion revealed that extracellular heterodimeric proteins S100a8/a9 were highly upregulated. The increase in S100a8/a9 mRNA of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) neutrophils isolated from both the peripheral blood and heart was highest on day 1 of angiotensin II infusion and decreased to baseline at day 7. Immunostaining showed that S100a8/a9 was primarily present in infiltrating CD11b(+)Gr1(+) neutrophils in the heart. The receptor for advanced glycation end products, an S100a8/a9 receptor, was expressed in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Microarray analysis and Bio-Plex protein array showed that treatment of CFs with recombinant S100a8/a9 activated multiple chemokine and cytokines released. Luciferase reporter assay indicated S100a8/a9-activated nuclear factor-\u03ba B pathway in CFs. Consequently, recombinant S100a8/a9-treated CFs promoted migration of monocytes and CFs, whereas neutralizing S100a9 antibody blocked S100a9 or receptor for advanced glycation end products-suppressed cellular migration. Finally, administration of a neutralizing S100a9 antibody prevented angiotensin II infusion-induced nuclear factor-\u03ba B activation, inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine production, subsequent perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, and hypertrophy in heart.

{"title": "Erbin is a negative modulator of cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "ErbB2 interacting protein (Erbin) is a widely expressed protein and participates in inhibition of several intracellular signaling pathways. Its mRNA has been found to be present in relatively high levels in the heart. However, its physiological role in the heart has not been explored. In the present work, we elucidated the role of Erbin in cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in mice either by isoproterenol administration or by aortic constriction. The level of Erbin was significantly decreased in both models. Erbin(-/-) mice rapidly develop decompensated cardiac hypertrophy, and following severe pressure overload all Erbin(-/-) mice died from heart failure. Down-regulation of Erbin expression was also observed in biopsies derived from human failing hearts. It is known that Erbin inhibits Ras-mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by binding to Soc-2 suppressor of clear homolog (Shoc2). Our data clearly show that ERK phosphorylation is enhanced in the heart tissues of Erbin(-/-) mice. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrate here that Erbin associates with Shoc2 in both whole hearts and in cardiomyocytes, and that in the absence of Erbin, Raf is phosphorylated and binds Shoc2, resulting in ERK phosphorylation. In conclusion, Erbin is an inhibitor of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and this inhibition is mediated, at least in part, by modulating ERK signaling.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-04-09", "authors": ["InbalRachmin", "SagiTshori", "YoavSmith", "AmitOppenheim", "SylvieMarchetto", "GillianKay", "Roger S-YFoo", "NoaDagan", "EliahuGolomb", "DanGilon", "Jean-PaulBorg", "EhudRazin"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1320350111"}

To explore the putative effects of mechanical cues in regeneration of the cardiac tissue, we investigated therapeutically important cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), a heterogeneous patient- or animal-specific cell population containing c-Kit(+) multipotent stem cells. We showed that mechanical cues can instruct c-Kit(+) cell differentiation along two lineages with corresponding morphogenic changes, while also serving to amplify the initial c-Kit(+) subpopulation. In particular, mechanical cues mimicking the structure of myocardial extracellular matrix specify cardiomyogenic fate, while cues mimicking myocardium rigidity specify endothelial fates. Furthermore, we found that these cues dynamically regulate the same molecular species, p190RhoGAP, which then acts through both RhoA-dependent and independent mechanisms. Thus, differential regulation of p190RhoGAP molecule by either mechanical inputs or genetic manipulation can determine lineage type specification. Since human CDCs are already in phase II clinical trials, the potential therapeutic use of mechanical or genetic manipulation of the cell fate could enhance effectiveness of these progenitor cells in cardiac repair, and shed new light on differentiation mechanisms in cardiac and other tissues.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2014-04-09", "authors": ["NoneKshitiz", "JunaidAfzal", "Deok-HoKim", "AndreLevchenko"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.1700"}

Neonatal mice retain a regenerative capacity over a short time-frame (\u22646 days), but this capacity is lost by 7 days of age. In the present study, differential gene expression profiling of mouse cardiac tissue was performed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process. The global gene expression patterns of the neonatal C57BL/6J mouse heart were examined at three key time-points (1, 6 and 7 days old) using digital gene expression analysis. In the distribution of total clean tags, high-expression tags (>100 copies) were found to be predominant, whereas low expression tags (<5 copies) occupied the majority of distinct tag distributions. In total, 306 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in cardiac tissue, with the expression levels of 115 genes upregulated and those of 191 genes downregulated in 7-day-old mice compared with expression levels in 1- and 6-day-old mice, respectively. The expression levels of five DEGs were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gene ontology analysis revealed a large proportion of DEGs distributed throughout the cell, and these DEGs were associated with binding as well as catalytic, hydrolase, transferase and molecular transducer activities. Furthermore, these genes were involved in cellular, metabolic and developmental processes, as well as biological regulation and signaling pathways.

PGD\u2082 synthase is abundantly expressed in heart tissue and PGD\u2082 has recently been found to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis. PGD\u2082 is an unstable prostanoid metabolite; therefore the objective of the present study was to elucidate whether its final dehydration product, 15-deoxy-\u0394\u00b9\u00b2,\u00b9\u2074-PGJ\u2082 (15d-PGJ\u2082, present at high levels in ischemic myocardium) might cause cardiomyocyte damage.\nUsing specific (ant)agonists we show that 15d-PGJ\u2082 induced formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of p38 and p42/44 MAPKs via the PGD2 receptor DP2 (but not DP1 or PPAR\u03b3) in the murine atrial cardiomyocyte HL-1 cell line. Activation of the DP2-ROS-MAPK axis by 15d-PGJ\u2082 enhanced transcription and translation of TNF\u03b1 and induced apoptosis in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Silencing of TNF\u03b1 significantly attenuated the extrinsic (caspase-8) and intrinsic apoptotic pathways (bax and caspase-9), caspase-3 activation and downstream PARP cleavage and \u03b3H2AX activation. The apoptotic machinery was unaffected by intracellular calcium, transcription factor NF-\u03baB and its downstream target p53.

We recently clarified that enzymatically-generated hydrosulfide derivatives regulate the metabolism and signaling of 8-nitro-cGMP. Although hydrogen sulfide was proposed to be a gaseous signaling mediator, its exact nature and physiological functions remain obscure. We thus found that particular hydropersulfide derivatives rather than hydrogen sulfide greatly ameliorated chronic heart failure after myocardial infarction in vivo in mice. This potent cardioprotective effect resulted from strong suppression of H-Ras signaling activated by electrophilic stimulation with 8-nitro-cGMP functioning as a second messenger for the redox signaling induced by NO and ROS. A significant amount of 8-nitro-cGMP was formed in the heart tissue after myocardial infarction, and hydrogen sulfide exogenously administered completely nullified this formation. We have reportedly shown that hydropersulfide effectively thiolated electrophiles in cells, which is best represented by 8-nitro-cGMP.

Dose-volume parameters for the PTV, heart, lungs, and breasts were compared.\nBetter dose conformity was achieved with VMAT compared to 3D-CRT (conformity index 1.24\u00b10.09 vs. 1.49\u00b10.20). Non-PTV ipsilateral breast receiving \u226550% of the prescribed dose was on average reduced by 28% in VMAT plans compared to 3D-CRT plans. Mean heart dose (MHD) reduced from 2.0 (0.1-5.1) Gy in 3D-CRT(FB) to 0.6 (0.1-1.6) Gy in VMAT(vmDIBH). VMAT is beneficial for MHD reduction if MHD with 3D-CRT exceeds 0.5Gy. Cardiac dose reduction as a result of VMAT increases with increasing initial MHD, and adding vmDIBH reduces the cardiac dose further. Mean dose to the ipsilateral lung decreased from 3.7 (0.7-8.7) to 1.8 (0.5-4.0) Gy with VMAT(vmDIBH) compared to 3D-CRT(FB). VMAT resulted in a slight increase in the contralateral breast dose (DMean) always remaining <1.9 Gy).\nFor APBI patients, VMAT improves PTV dose conformity and delivers lower doses to the ipsilateral breast and lung compared to 3D-CRT. This goes at the cost of a slight but acceptable increase of the contralateral breast dose. VMAT reduces cardiac dose if MHD exceeds 0.5 Gy for 3D-CRT.

{"title": "The complex regulation of tanshinone IIA in rats with hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Tanshinone IIA has definite protective effects on various cardiovascular diseases. However, in hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (H-LVH), the signaling pathways of tanshinone IIA in inhibition of remodeling and cardiac dysfunction remain unclear. Two-kidney, one-clip induced hypertensive rats (n\u200a=\u200a32) were randomized to receive tanshinone IIA (5, 10, 15 mg/kg per day) or 5% glucose injection (GS). Sham-operated rats (n\u200a=\u200a8) received 5%GS as control. Cardiac function and dimensions were assessed by using an echocardiography system. Histological determination of the fibrosis and apoptosis was performed using hematoxylin eosin, Masson's trichrome and TUNEL staining. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases type 2 (TIMP2) protein expressions in rat myocardial tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Rat cardiomyocytes were isolated by a Langendorff perfusion method. After 48 h culture, the supernatant and cardiomyocytes were collected to determine the potential related proteins impact on cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis. Compared with the sham rats, the heart tissues of H-LVH (5%GS) group suffered severely from the oxidative damage, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In the H-LVH group, tanshinone IIA treated decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Tanshinone IIA inhibited cardiomyocytes apoptosis as confirmed by the reduction of TUNEL positive cardiomyocytes and the down-regulation of Caspase-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Meanwhile, plasma apelin level increased with down-regulation of APJ receptor. Tanshinone IIA suppressed cardiac fibrosis through regulating the paracrine factors released by cardiomyocytes and the TGF-\u03b2/Smads signaling pathway activity. In conclusion, our in vivo study showed that tanshinone IIA could improve heart function by enhancing myocardial contractility, inhibiting ECM deposition, and limiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and oxidative damage.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-03-22", "authors": ["HuiPang", "BingHan", "TaoYu", "ZhenPeng"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0092216\n10.2147/VHRM.S11235.PubMed:21468174\n10.1056/NEJMra072139.PubMed:18367740\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.141887.PubMed:19933923\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.109.883652.PubMed:20061518\n10.1172/JCI31044.PubMed:17332884\n10.1152/physrev.00012.2007.PubMed:17928585\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.041.PubMed:21774934\n10.3390/molecules161210002.PubMed:22138858\n10.1159/000324012.PubMed:21220930\n10.1142/S0192415X11008890.PubMed:21476213\n10.1517/13543776.2013.743995.PubMed:23231009\n10.1161/01.RES.0000148632.35500.d9.PubMed:15539639\n10.1053/j.semtcvs.2008.04.001.PubMed:18707639\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.033.PubMed:21059352\n10.1152/ajpheart.00846.2011.PubMed:22467306\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705668.PubMed:14757703\n10.1016/j.peptides.2009.02.010.PubMed:19463748\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn036.PubMed:19168518\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.783910.PubMed:18794390\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.11.051.PubMed:19324256\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.845792.PubMed:21263005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.573865.PubMed:16636176\n10.1038/aps.2010.176.PubMed:21102479\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.01.003.PubMed:21236334\n10.1089/ars.2006.8.1621.PubMed:16987016\n10.1016/j.jss.2009.05.002.PubMed:19815236\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.010908.163111.PubMed:20148665\n10.1242/jcs.031682.PubMed:19193868\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.863.PubMed:22261166\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2013.02.005.PubMed:23438363\n10.1096/fj.09-140715.PubMed:20040517\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.0366-6999.2009.19.031.PubMed:20079140\n10.1093/cvr/cvq308.PubMed:20880837\n10.1007/s11886-009-0061-5.PubMed:19863866\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.516963.PubMed:16103240\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142230.PubMed:21314431\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.786640.PubMed:18824748\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209189.PubMed:20056917\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.01.003.PubMed:20080133\n10.1016/j.phymed.2010.06.002.PubMed:20638255\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050436.PubMed:23227174\n10.1038/74651.PubMed:10742145\n10.2174/1570161043476500.PubMed:15320831\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2707.PubMed:17518640\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328312c889.PubMed:19008723\n10.1186/1479-5876-10-183.PubMed:22943793\n10.1007/s11596-009-0417-5.PubMed:19662366"}
{"title": "Reducing methylglyoxal as a therapeutic target for diabetic heart disease.", "abstract": "Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Diabetes affects cardiac tissue through several different, yet interconnected, pathways. Damage to endothelial cells from direct exposure to high blood glucose is a primary cause of deregulated heart function. Toxic by-products of non-enzymatic glycolysis, mainly methylglyoxal, have been shown to contribute to the endothelial cell damage. Methylglyoxal is a precursor for advanced glycation end-products, and, although it is detoxified by the glyoxalase system, this protection mechanism fails in diabetes. Recent work has identified methylglyoxal as a therapeutic target for the prevention of cardiovascular complications in diabetes. A better understanding of the glyoxalase system and the effects of methylglyoxal may lead to more advanced strategies for treating cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2014-03-22", "authors": ["BrankaVulesevic", "Ross WMilne", "Erik JSuuronen"], "doi": "10.1042/BST20130254"}
{"title": "SERCA2a gene therapy can improve symptomatic heart failure in \u03b4-sarcoglycan-deficient animals.", "abstract": "The loss of dystrophin or its associated proteins results in the development of muscle wasting frequently associated with cardiomyopathy. Contractile cardiac tissue is injured and replaced by fibrous tissue or fatty infiltrates, leading to a progressive decrease of the contractile force and finally to end-stage heart failure. At the time symptoms appear, restoration of a functional allele of the causative gene might not be sufficient to prevent disease progression. Alterations in Ca(2+) transport and intracellular calcium levels have been implicated in many types of pathological processes, especially in heart disease. On the basis of a gene transfer strategy, we analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of primary gene correction in a \u03b4-sarcoglycan (\u03b4-SG)-deficient animal model versus gene transfer of the Ca(2+) pump hSERCA2a (human sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a), at a symptomatic stage of heart disease. Our results strongly suggest that restoration of \u03b4-SG at this stage of disease will not lead to improved clinical outcome. However, restoration of proper Ca(2+) handling by means of amplifying SERCA2a expression in the myocardium can lead to functional improvement. Abnormalities in Ca(2+) handling play an important role in disease progression toward heart failure, and increased SERCA2a levels appear to significantly improve cardiac contraction and relaxation. Beneficial effects persist at least over a period of 6 months, and the evolution of cardiac functional parameters paralleled those of normal controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a plasmid formulation based on amphiphilic block copolymers can provide a safe and efficient platform for myocardial gene therapies. The use of synthetic formulations for myocardial gene transfer might thus overcome one of the major hurdles linked to viral vectors, that is, repeat administrations.", "journal": "Human gene therapy", "date": "2014-03-22", "authors": ["SophieBouyon", "V\u00e9roniqueRoussel", "YvesFromes"], "doi": "10.1089/hum.2013.132"}

The MiRNA-29 family (29a, 29b, and 29c) targets mRNAs that encode collagens and other proteins involved in fibrosis. In this study we assessed the effects of swimming training (ST) on expression of the cardiac miRNA-29 family and on genes encoding collagen after MI in rats.\nST consisted of 60 min/day/10 weeks and began four weeks after MI. MiRNA and collagen expression analysis were performed in the infarcted region (IR), border region (BR) of the infarcted region and in the remote myocardium (RM) of the left ventricle.\nMiRNA-29a expression increased 32% in BR and 52% in RM in the TR-INF compared with SED-INF. MiRNA-29c increased by 63% in BR and 55% in RM in TR-INF compared with SED-INF group. COL IAI and COL IIIAI decreased by 63% and 62% in TR-INF, respectively, compared with SED-INF. COLIIIAI expression decreased by 16% in TR-INF compared with SED-INF.\nAltogether, our results showed that ST restores cardiac miRNA-29 (a and c) levels and prevents COL IAI and COL IIIAI expression in BR and RM, which may contribute to the improvement in ventricular function induced by swimming training, after MI. \u00a9 2014 S.

{"title": "Oxidative stress in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) during spawning migration.", "abstract": "The energetic and physiological challenges of spawning migrations in semelparous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) have been well characterized. However, the accompanying costs associated with oxidative stress during this nonfeeding migration and the potential connection to senescence have not been explored. Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between free radical production and absorption, leading to irreparable cellular damage that accumulates over time and contributes to senescence. The objective of this study was to determine whether oxidative stress occurs during migration between river entrance and spawning for maturing pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), a semelparous species. Samples of plasma, liver, heart, brain, red muscle, and white muscle were collected from individual pink salmon at both the beginning and the end of the freshwater migration and then assayed for antioxidant capacity as well as for oxidative DNA damage. Antioxidant capacity and DNA damage changed between sites on a tissue-specific basis, demonstrating that oxidative stress may be experienced differentially between tissues. Consistent with our prediction, DNA damage was higher and antioxidant capacity lower in plasma (an integrative measure of body condition) and heart tissue at the spawning grounds compared with river entrance. The increased oxidative stress of these tissues is correlated with the senescence and deterioration associated with a semelparous reproductive strategy. However, similar changes were not seen in liver, red muscle, or white muscle. More surprisingly, the antioxidant capacity was higher and DNA damage was lower in the brains of spawning migrants at the spawning grounds than at river entrance. The latter results highlight the importance of tissue-specific variability in understanding the role that oxidative stress may play in spawning migration success.", "journal": "Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ", "date": "2014-03-20", "authors": ["Samantha MWilson", "Jessica JTaylor", "Trisha AMackie", "David APatterson", "Steven JCooke", "William GWillmore"], "doi": "10.1086/674798"}

Here we showed by high-resolution 4C-seq analysis of the Scn10a-Scn5a locus in murine heart tissue that a cardiac enhancer located in Scn10a, encompassing SCN10A functional variant rs6801957, interacts with the promoter of Scn5a, a sodium channel-encoding gene that is critical for cardiac conduction. We observed that SCN5A transcript levels were several orders of magnitude higher than SCN10A transcript levels in both adult human and mouse heart tissue. Analysis of BAC transgenic mouse strains harboring an engineered deletion of the enhancer within Scn10a revealed that the enhancer was essential for Scn5a expression in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, the common SCN10A variant rs6801957 modulated Scn5a expression in the heart. In humans, the SCN10A variant rs6801957, which correlated with slowed conduction, was associated with reduced SCN5A expression.

Baseline contact (27\u2009\u00b1\u20098 g/cm(2)) ECI value was 99\u2009\u00b1\u200913, whereas ECI values in a noncontact site (0 g/cm(2)) and in a light contact site (1-10 g/cm(2)) were respectively 66\u2009\u00b1\u200912 and 77\u2009\u00b1\u200910 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Baseline contact ECI values were not different depending on AF presentation (paroxysmal AF, 98\u2009\u00b1\u20099; persistent AF, 100\u2009\u00b1\u20099) or on cardiac rhythm (sinus rhythm, 97\u2009\u00b1\u20097; AF,101\u2009\u00b1\u200910). In all PVs, ECI was significantly reduced during and after ablation (ECI during RF, 56\u2009\u00b1\u200915; ECI after RF, 72\u2009\u00b1\u200916; p\u2009<\u20090.001). A mean reduction of 32.2% during RF delivery and 25.4% immediately after RF discontinuation compared with baseline ECI was observed.\nSuccessful PV isolation is associated with a significant decrease in ECI of at least 20 %.

{"title": "Redox proteomic identification of HNE-bound mitochondrial proteins in cardiac tissues reveals a systemic effect on energy metabolism after doxorubicin treatment.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most effective anticancer drugs, is known to generate progressive cardiac damage, which is due, in part, to DOX-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). The elevated ROS often induce oxidative protein modifications that result in alteration of protein functions. This study demonstrates that the level of proteins adducted by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a lipid peroxidation product, is significantly increased in mouse heart mitochondria after DOX treatment. A redox proteomics method involving two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry and investigation of protein databases identified several HNE-modified mitochondrial proteins, which were verified by HNE-specific immunoprecipitation in cardiac mitochondria from the DOX-treated mice. The majority of the identified proteins are related to mitochondrial energy metabolism. These include proteins in the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. The enzymatic activities of the HNE-adducted proteins were significantly reduced in DOX-treated mice. Consistent with the decline in the function of the HNE-adducted proteins, the respiratory function of cardiac mitochondria as determined by oxygen consumption rate was also significantly reduced after DOX treatment. Treatment with Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, an SOD mimic, averted the doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions as well as the HNE-protein adductions. Together, the results demonstrate that free radical-mediated alteration of energy metabolism is an important mechanism mediating DOX-induced cardiac injury, suggesting that metabolic intervention may represent a novel approach to preventing cardiac injury after chemotherapy.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["YZhao", "SMiriyala", "LMiao", "MMitov", "DSchnell", "S KDhar", "JCai", "J BKlein", "RSultana", "D AButterfield", "MVore", "IBatinic-Haberle", "SBondada", "D KSt Clair"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.03.001"}

Stem cell therapy appears to be one of the most promising approaches, though preclinical results are hitherto contradictory and clinical trials scanty and/or limited to phase-I. The limited knowledge about stem cell early homing in infarcted cardiac tissues can concur to this scenario.\nThe stem cell migration was assessed in in-vitro and ex-vivo models of heart ischemia, employing a rat dental pulp stem cell line (MUR-1) that shares the same ontogenic progenitors with portions of the heart, expresses markers typical of cardiac/vascular-like progenitors and is able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes in-vitro.\nHere, we demonstrated that the MUR-1 can reach the injured cells/tissue and make contacts with the damaged cardiomyocytes, likely through Connexin 43, N-cadherin and von Willebrand Factor mediated cell-cell interactions, both in in-vitro and ex-vivo models. Furthermore, we found that SDF-1, FGF-2 and HGF, but not VEGF are involved as chemotactic factors in MUR-1 migration, notifying a similarity with neural crest cell behavior during the organogenesis of both the splanchnocranium and the heart.\nHerein we found a similarity between what happens during the heart organogenesis and the early migration and homing of MUR-1 cells in ischemic models.\nThe comprehension of molecular aspects underlying the early phases of stem cell migration and interaction with damaged organ contributes to the future achievement of the coveted stem cell-mediated organ regeneration and function preservation in-vivo.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["FDi Scipio", "A ESprio", "AFolino", "M ECarere", "PSalamone", "ZYang", "MBerrone", "MPrat", "GLosano", "RRastaldo", "G NBerta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.03.005"}

We found that the expression of CNN1 decreased significantly in the heart tissue of a cTnT(R141W) transgenic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mouse model and an adriamycin (ADR)-induced DCM mouse model, suggesting that CNN1 is involved in the pathogenesis of DCM. However, the role of CNN1 on cardiac function, especially on pathogenesis of DCM, has not been clarified. In this study, we tested whether rescued expression of CNN1 could prevent the development of DCM and investigated its possible mechanisms.\nThe DCM phenotypes were significantly improved with the transgenic expression of CNN1 in the cTnT(R141W)\u00d7CNN1 double transgenic (DTG) mice, which was demonstrated by the survival, cardiac geometry and function analyses, as well as microstructural and ultrastructural observations based on echocardiography and histology examination. The expression of CNN1 could also resist the cardiac geometry breakage and dysfunction in the ADR-induced DCM mice model. Meanwhile, the epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (\u03b5PKC) activator and inhibitor could reverse the activation of \u03b5PKC/ERK/mTOR pathway and DCM phenotypes in the cTnT(R141W) and cTnT(R141W)\u00d7CNN1 double transgenic (DTG) mice.\n\u03b5PKC/ERK/mTOR pathway activation induced by the rescued expression of CNN1 contributed to the improvement of cardiac dysfunction and pathological changes observed in the DTG mice.

Titin has been identified as a target of S-glutathionylation, an end product of the nitric-oxide-signaling cascade that increases cardiac muscle elasticity. However, it is unknown how S-glutathionylation may regulate the elasticity of titin and cardiac tissue. Here, we show that mechanical unfolding of titin immunoglobulin (Ig) domains exposes buried cysteine residues, which then can be S-glutathionylated. S-glutathionylation of cryptic cysteines greatly decreases the mechanical stability of the parent Ig domain as well as its ability to fold. Both effects favor a more extensible state of titin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that S-glutathionylation of cryptic cysteines in titin mediates mechanochemical modulation of the elasticity of human cardiomyocytes.

The study focuses on the way to determine optimal procedures for incorporating the SAP solution and the cells in the patch to ensure cell colonization and a homogeneous cell distribution in the construct before implantation. The problems associated with the scale-up of the different procedures raised by the large size of the construct are discussed.\nExperiments were performed to choose between different assembling alternatives: incorporation of the SAP gel before cell seeding or simultaneous SAP and cell loading of the scaffold; surface seeding of cells or cell injection into the scaffold pores; dissemination of the cells throughout the scaffold before incubation by gentle shaking or by centrifugation. Immunocytochemistry techniques and confocal and scanning electron microscopies were employed to assess and quantify cell colonization of the material and early cell distribution. Cell concentrations and the uniformity of cellular distribution throughout the scaffold were taken as the main criteria to decide between the different alternative procedures.\nThe combination of peptide preloading, cell injection, and shaking before incubation yielded the best results in terms of greater cell density and the most uniform distribution after 24 h of culture compared with the other methods. These techniques could be scaled-up to obtain large biohybrid cardiac patches with success.\nThe results obtained after the different seeding methods allowed us to establish an effective protocol for the assembly of large biohybrid patches for their subsequent implantation in the heart of a big animal model of myocardial infarct in the context of a preclinical study.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In case 1, 25 horses broke into a shed and ingested feed that was supplemented with 800 g/ton (880 \u00b5g/g) of monensin. Within 48 hr, 1 horse had died, 2 developed cardiac arrhythmias, lethargy, and recumbency, and another was euthanized due to severe deterioration. Minimal histologic lesions were noted in the horse that died peracutely, while another showed characteristic lesions of acute cardiomyocyte degeneration and necrosis. Stomach content, heart, liver, urine, and serum revealed various detectable concentrations of monensin in clinically affected and unaffected horses with known exposure. In case 2, a pastured horse had access to a mineral mix containing 1,600 g/ton (1,760 \u00b5g/g) of monensin. Within 48 hr, the horse became symptomatic and was euthanized because of severe respiratory distress. Histologic cardiac lesions were minimal but detectable amounts of monensin were found in blood, heart, liver, and stomach contents. In both cases, monensin toxicosis was confirmed with toxicological analysis. These cases demonstrate an overall lack of correlation of monensin concentrations in various biological samples with clinical outcome. However, serum, urine, blood, liver, heart, and stomach content can be tested to confirm exposure.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of microstructure on the initiation of reentry from focal stimulation inside a poorly coupled region embedded in more well-coupled tissue. Two-dimensional discrete computer models of ventricular monolayers (1 \u00d7 1 cm) were randomly generated to represent heterogeneity in the cardiac microstructure. A small, central poorly coupled patch (0.40 \u00d7 0.40 cm) was introduced to represent the site of focal activity. Simulated unipolar electrogram recordings were computed at various points in the tissue. As the gap conductance of the patch decreased, conduction slowed and became increasingly complex, marked by fractionated electrograms with reduced amplitude. Near the limit of conduction block, isolated breakthrough sites occurred at single cells along the patch boundary and were marked by long cell-to-cell delays and negative deflections on electrogram recordings. The strongest determinant of the site of wavefront breakthrough was the connectivity of the brick wall architecture, which enabled current flow through small regions of overlapping cells to drive propagation into the well-coupled zone. In conclusion, breakthroughs at the size scale of a single cell can occur at the boundary of source-load mismatch allowing focal activations from slow conducting regions to produce reentry.

Vitamin E reduces oxidative stress in the heart tissue in spite of a decrease in CL activity (increase in antioxidant reserve).", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2014-03-07", "authors": ["KailashPrasad", "Erick DMcNair", "GudrunCaspar-Bell", "AMabood Qureshi"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-014-2004-8"}
{"title": "Blocking the receptor for advanced glycation end product activation attenuates autoimmune myocarditis.", "abstract": "The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) is a pattern recognition receptor for endogenous ligands, and is associated with various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of RAGE activation in myocarditis has yet to be examined. The potential role of RAGE in the development of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) and the effect of RAGE blocking in attenuating the inflammation in the EAM was investigated.\nEAM was evoked in Lewis rats by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) was injected to block RAGE activation. Echocardiogram, histological, and immunohistochemical examinations were conducted on days 21 and 42. In rats with EAM, RAGE expression in cardiac tissue was prominent on day 21. Rats administered sRAGE during the early antigen-priming phase showed marked attenuation in acute and chronic inflammation compared with untreated rats. RAGE expression was significantly reduced in rats treated in the early phase. However, sRAGE administration, after the initial antigen-priming phase, failed to ameliorate EAM development.\nRAGE expression was significantly increased in the heart during EAM. Blocking RAGE activation with sRAGE during the early antigen-priming phase reduced acute and chronic inflammation and improved cardiac function. In contrast, blocking RAGE after the early phase did not attenuate EAM development. These results imply that RAGE is involved in regulating innate immune responses during the early phase of myocarditis development.", "journal": "Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "date": "2014-03-07", "authors": ["Woo-InYang", "DajeongLee", "Da LyungLee", "Sung-YuHong", "Sang-HakLee", "Seok-MinKang", "Dong-HoonChoi", "YangsooJang", "Se HoonKim", "SunghaPark"], "doi": "10.1253/circj.cj-13-1235"}

{"title": "Differential hypoxic tolerance is mediated by activation of heat shock response and nitric oxide pathway.", "abstract": "The fall in ambient oxygen pressure in high-altitude milieu elicits a wide range of physiological responses in the myocardium, which may differ from individual to individual. This condition, known as hypobaric hypoxia, invokes the cardioprotective heat shock response. The present study focuses on the role played by this ubiquitous response in mediating a differential tolerance to acute hypoxic stress. Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to simulated hypoxia equivalent to 223 mmHg pressure, screened on the basis of time taken for onset of a characteristic hyperventilatory response, and categorized as susceptible (<10 min), normal (10-25 min), or tolerant (>25 min). The tolerant animals displayed a significant upregulation of heat shock protein (Hsp)70/HSPA, evident through immunohistochemical staining of the cardiac tissue. The increased expression of transcription factor heat shock factor-1 led to the downstream activation of other chaperones, including Hsp90/HSPC, Hsp60/HSPD1, and Hsp27/HSPB1. The higher induction of HSPs in tolerant animals contributed to higher nitric oxide synthesis mediated by both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase activation. Conversely, susceptible animals showed significantly higher expression of the proinflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor alpha and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells in the myocardium. Evaluation of circulatory stress markers identified increased levels of reactive oxygen species, corticosterone and endothelin-1 in the susceptible animals highlighting their vulnerability to hypoxic stress. The heat shock response, through the action of chaperones and enhanced NO generation thus contributes substantially to the ability to sustain survival under acute sub lethal hypoxia.", "journal": "Cell stress & chaperones", "date": "2014-03-05", "authors": ["KanikaJain", "GeethaSuryakumar", "LillyGanju", "Shashi BalaSingh"], "doi": "10.1007/s12192-014-0504-9\n10.1101/gad.1044503\n10.1074/jbc.M608013200\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2003.12.010\n10.1016/S0006-8993(02)02746-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.650796\n10.1002/ajhb.22355\n10.1074/jbc.M000340200\n10.1161/01.RES.83.2.117\n10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-3\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00649-1\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.06.026\n10.2174/1874467210902010056\n10.1074/jbc.273.27.17147\n10.1038/labinvest.3700027\n10.2174/187152807780832274\n10.1097/00003246-200201001-00006\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.133413\n10.1016/S0304-4165(00)00159-8\n10.1038/21218\n10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226928\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1388\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1505\n10.1161/01.RES.84.1.21\n10.1089/ham.2012.1064\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.07.180\n10.1016/j.biochi.2013.06.018\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.09.011\n10.1385/CT:3:3:229\n10.1161/01.RES.86.3.319\n10.1074/jbc.272.2.1402\n10.1007/s10741-010-9180-8\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00354-6\n10.1021/tx00026a012\n10.1016/0014-5793(95)00801-F\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.12.4343\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09226.x\n10.1101/gad.12.24.3788\n10.1097/01.fjc.0000166234.11336.a9\n10.1007/s004210050669\n10.1016/j.carpath.2010.01.002\n10.1002/jemt.21000\n10.1073/pnas.170276797\n10.1186/gb-2012-13-1-r1\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.1995.tb14901.x\n10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00364-6\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00071-7\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.942250\n10.1006/bbrc.1997.6076\n10.1093/emboj/cdf528\n10.4103/2045-8932.97613\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.07.015"}
{"title": "Effect of risperidone metabolism and P-glycoprotein gene polymorphism on QT interval in patients with schizophrenia.", "abstract": "Risperidone (RIS) is a frequently used efficacious psychotropic drug. However, it prolongs the QTc interval and may cause fatal arrhythmia. Little is known on the determinants of this RIS side effect. RIS is metabolized by CYP2D6, and is subject to drug efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) gene. P-gp removes both RIS and its metabolite 9-OH-RIS from cardiac tissue. To investigate the effect of RIS metabolism and ABCB1 gene polymorphisms on QTc, steady-state plasma RIS and 9-OH-RIS levels, and QTc were measured. CYP2D6, ABCB1 C3435T and G2677T/A genotypes were determined in 66 schizophrenia patients on RIS. QTc was significantly longer in patients with ABCB1 3435CT+3435 TT than in those with 3435CC (P=0.006). ABCB1 G2677T/A genotype did not affect QTc. Multiple regression analysis showed that C/T or T/T genotypes at the ABCB1 C3435T locus, lower weight, and older age prolonged QTc.

{"title": "Regenerative implants for cardiovascular tissue engineering.", "abstract": "A fundamental problem that affects the field of cardiovascular surgery is the paucity of autologous tissue available for surgical reconstructive procedures. Although the best results are obtained when an individual's own tissues are used for surgical repair, this is often not possible as a result of pathology of autologous tissues or lack of a compatible replacement source from the body. The use of prosthetics is a popular solution to overcome shortage of autologous tissue, but implantation of these devices comes with an array of additional problems and complications related to biocompatibility. Transplantation offers another option that is widely used but complicated by problems related to rejection and donor organ scarcity. The field of tissue engineering represents a promising new option for replacement surgical procedures. Throughout the years, intensive interdisciplinary, translational research into cardiovascular regenerative implants has been undertaken in an effort to improve surgical outcome and better quality of life for patients with cardiovascular defects. Vascular, valvular, and heart tissue repair are the focus of these efforts. Implants for these neotissues can be divided into 2 groups: biologic and synthetic. These materials are used to facilitate the delivery of cells or drugs to diseased, damaged, or absent tissue. Furthermore, they can function as a tissue-forming device used to enhance the body's own repair mechanisms. Various preclinical studies and clinical trials using these advances have shown that tissue-engineered materials are a viable option for surgical repair, but require refinement if they are going to reach their clinical potential.

{"title": "A nanopatterned cell-seeded cardiac patch prevents electro-uncoupling and improves the therapeutic efficacy of cardiac repair.", "abstract": "The heart is an extremely sophisticated organ with nanoscale anisotropic structure, contractility and electro-conductivity; however, few studies have addressed the influence of cardiac anisotropy on cell transplantation for myocardial repair. Here, we hypothesized that a graft's anisotropy of myofiber orientation determines the mechano-electrical characteristics and the therapeutic efficacy. We developed aligned- and random-orientated nanofibrous electrospun patches (aEP and rEP, respectively) with or without seeding of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and endothelial cells (ECs) to test this hypothesis. Atomic force microscopy showed a better beating frequency and amplitude of CMs when cultured on aEP than that from cells cultured on rEP. For the in vivo test, a total of 66 rats were divided into six groups: sham, myocardial infarction (MI), MI + aEP, MI + rEP, MI + CM-EC/aEP and MI + CM-EC/rEP (n \u2265 10 for each group). Implantation of aEP or rEP provided mechanical support and thus retarded functional aggravation at 56 days after MI. Importantly, CM-EC/aEP implantation further improved therapeutic outcomes, while cardiac deterioration occurred on the CM-EC/rEP group. Similar results were shown by hemodynamic and infarct size examination. Another independent in vivo study was performed and electrocardiography and optical mapping demonstrated that there were more ectopic activities and defective electro-coupling after CM-EC/rEP implantation, which worsened cardiac functions. Together these results provide comprehensive functional characterizations and demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of a nanopatterned anisotropic cardiac patch. Importantly, the study confirms the significance of cardiac anisotropy recapitulation in myocardial tissue engineering, which is valuable for the future development of translational nanomedicine.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2014-03-04", "authors": ["Yi-DongLin", "Ming-ChinKo", "Su-TingWu", "Sheng-FengLi", "Jung-FengHu", "Yu-JunLai", "Hans I-ChenHarn", "I-ChuangLaio", "Ming-LongYeh", "Hung-IYeh", "Ming-JerTang", "Kung-ChaoChang", "Fong-ChinSu", "Erika I HWei", "Sho-ToneLee", "Jyh-HongChen", "Allan SHoffman", "Wen-TengWu", "Patrick C HHsieh"], "doi": "10.1039/c3bm60289c"}
{"title": "Maternal bisphenol a exposure impacts the fetal heart transcriptome.", "abstract": "Conditions during fetal development influence health and disease in adulthood, especially during critical windows of organogenesis. Fetal exposure to the endocrine disrupting chemical, bisphenol A (BPA) affects the development of multiple organ systems in rodents and monkeys. However, effects of BPA exposure on cardiac development have not been assessed. With evidence that maternal BPA is transplacentally delivered to the developing fetus, it becomes imperative to examine the physiological consequences of gestational exposure during primate development. Herein, we evaluate the effects of daily, oral BPA exposure of pregnant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) on the fetal heart transcriptome. Pregnant monkeys were given daily oral doses (400 \u00b5g/kg body weight) of BPA during early (50-100 \u00b1 2 days post conception, dpc) or late (100 \u00b1 2 dpc--term), gestation. At the end of treatment, fetal heart tissues were collected and chamber specific transcriptome expression was assessed using genome-wide microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted on select genes and ventricular tissue glycogen content was quantified. Our results show that BPA exposure alters transcription of genes that are recognized for their role in cardiac pathophysiologies. Importantly, myosin heavy chain, cardiac isoform alpha (Myh6) was down-regulated in the left ventricle, and 'A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 12', long isoform (Adam12-l) was up-regulated in both ventricles, and the right atrium of the heart in BPA exposed fetuses.

{"title": "Automated analysis of contractile force and Ca2+ transients in engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Contraction and relaxation are fundamental aspects of cardiomyocyte functional biology. They reflect the response of the contractile machinery to the systolic increase and diastolic decrease of the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration. The analysis of contractile function and Ca(2+) transients is therefore important to discriminate between myofilament responsiveness and changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis. This article describes an automated technology to perform sequential analysis of contractile force and Ca(2+) transients in up to 11 strip-format, fibrin-based rat, mouse, and human fura-2-loaded engineered heart tissues (EHTs) under perfusion and electrical stimulation. Measurements in EHTs under increasing concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+) and responses to isoprenaline and carbachol demonstrate that EHTs recapitulate basic principles of heart tissue functional biology. Ca(2+) concentration-response curves in rat, mouse, and human EHTs indicated different maximal twitch forces (0.22, 0.05, and 0.08 mN in rat, mouse, and human, respectively; P < 0.001) and different sensitivity to external Ca(2+) (EC50: 0.15, 0.39, and 1.05 mM Ca(2+) in rat, mouse, and human, respectively; P < 0.001) in the three groups. In contrast, no difference in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity was detected between skinned rat and human EHTs, suggesting that the difference in sensitivity to external Ca(2+) concentration is due to changes in Ca(2+) handling proteins. Finally, this study confirms that fura-2 has Ca(2+) buffering effects and is thereby changing the force response to extracellular Ca(2+).", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The anodal SI curve contains a \"dip\" in which the S2 threshold increases with interval. Two explanations exist for this dip: (1) electrotonic interaction between regions of depolarization and hyperpolarization; and (2) the sodium-calcium exchange (NCX) current. The goal of this study is to use mathematical modeling to determine which explanation is correct.\nThe bidomain model represents cardiac tissue and the Luo-Rudy model describes the active membrane. The SI curve is determined by applying a threshold stimulus at different time intervals after a previous action potential. During space-clamped and equal-anisotropy-ratios simulations, anodal excitation does not occur. During unequal-anisotropy-ratios simulations, electrotonic currents, not membrane currents, are present during the few milliseconds before excitation. The dip disappears with no NCX current, but is present with 50% or 75% reduction of it. The calcium-induced-calcium-release (CICR) current has little effect on the dip.\nThese results indicate that neither the NCX nor the CICR current is responsible for the dip in the anodal SI curve.

Cardiac-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP3) is a specific biomarker of muscle and heart tissue injury. This protein is purported to be involved in early myocardial development, adult myocardial tissue repair and responsible for the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. We have investigated the role of FABP3 in human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells under ischemic conditions. MSCs from 12 donors were cultured either in standard normoxic or modified hypoxic conditions, and the differential expression of FABP3 was tested by quantitative (RT)PCR and western blot. We also established stable FABP3 expression in MSCs and searched for variation in cellular proliferation and differentiation bioprocesses affected by hypoxic conditions. We identified: (1) the FABP3 differential expression pattern in the MSCs under hypoxic conditions; (2) over-expression of FABP3 inhibited the growth and proliferation of the MSCs; however, improved their survival in low oxygen environments; (3) the cell growth factors and positive cell cycle regulation genes, such as PCNA, APC, CCNB1, CCNB2 and CDC6 were all down-regulated; while the key negative cell cycle regulation genes TP53, BRCA1, CASP3 and CDKN1A were significantly up-regulated in the cells with FABP3 overexpression. Our data suggested that FABP3 was up-regulated under hypoxia; also negatively regulated the cell metabolic process and the mitotic cell cycle.

High-resolution photolithography techniques and microcontact printing were utilized to produce features of various rectangular geometries, with areas ranging from 2500\u00a0\u03bcm(2) to 160,000\u00a0\u03bcm(2). The microcontact printing method was used to pattern non-adherent poly(ethylene glycol) regions on gold coated glass slides. Matrigel and fibronectin extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were layered onto the gold-coated glass slides, providing a controlled geometry for cell adhesion. We used small molecule-based differentiation and an antibiotic purification step to produce a pure population of immature cardiomyocytes from H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We then seeded this pure population of human cardiomyocytes onto the micropatterned features of various sizes and observed how the cardiomyocytes remodeled their myofilament structure in response to the feature geometries. Immunofluorescence was used to measure \u03b1-actinin expression, and phalloidin stains were used to detect actin presence in the patterned cells. Analysis of nuclear alignment was also used to determine how cell direction was influenced by the features. The seeded cells showed clear alignment with the features, dependent on the width rather than the overall aspect ratio of the features. It was determined that features with widths between 30\u00a0\u03bcm and 80\u00a0\u03bcm promoted highly aligned cardiomyocytes with a dramatic increase in sarcomere alignment relative to the long axis of the pattern.

{"title": "Cardiac responses to elevated seawater temperature in Atlantic salmon.", "abstract": "Atlantic salmon aquaculture operations in the Northern hemisphere experience large seasonal fluctuations in seawater temperature. With summer temperatures often peaking around 18-20\u00b0C there is growing concern about the effects on fish health and performance. Since the heart has a major role in the physiological plasticity and acclimation to different thermal conditions in fish, we wanted to investigate how three and eight weeks exposure of adult Atlantic salmon to 19\u00b0C, previously shown to significantly reduce growth performance, affected expression of relevant genes and proteins in cardiac tissues under experimental conditions.\nTranscriptional responses in cardiac tissues after three and eight weeks exposure to 19\u00b0C (compared to thermal preference, 14\u00b0C) were analyzed with cDNA microarrays and validated by expression analysis of selected genes and proteins using real-time qPCR and immunofluorescence microscopy. Up-regulation of heat shock proteins and cell signaling genes may indicate involvement of the unfolded protein response in long-term acclimation to elevated temperature. Increased immunofluorescence staining of inducible nitric oxide synthase in spongy and compact myocardium as well as increased staining of vascular endothelial growth factor in epicardium could reflect induced vascularization and vasodilation, possibly related to increased oxygen demand. Increased staining of collagen I in the compact myocardium of 19\u00b0C fish may be indicative of a remodeling of connective tissue with long-term warm acclimation. Finally, higher abundance of transcripts for genes involved in innate cellular immunity and lower abundance of transcripts for humoral immune components implied altered immune competence in response to elevated temperature.\nLong-term exposure of Atlantic salmon to 19\u00b0C resulted in cardiac gene and protein expression changes indicating that the unfolded protein response, vascularization, remodeling of connective tissue and altered innate immune responses were part of the cardiac acclimation or response to elevated temperature.", "journal": "BMC physiology", "date": "2014-03-04", "authors": ["Sven MartinJ\u00f8rgensen", "VicenteCastro", "AlekseiKrasnov", "JacobTorgersen", "GerritTimmerhaus", "Ernst MortenHevr\u00f8y", "Tom JohnnyHansen", "SisselSusort", "OlavBreck", "HaraldTakle"], "doi": "10.1186/1472-6793-14-2\n10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02380.x\n10.1139/Z09-092\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024464\n10.1242/jeb.00547\n10.1242/jeb.01057\n10.1242/jeb.019281\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.10.037\n10.1128/JVI.02154-10\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037269\n10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.10.007\n10.1016/j.cbd.2010.04.006\n10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797\n10.1186/1471-2164-12-459\n10.1093/nar/30.9.e36\n10.1242/jeb.01488\n10.1016/j.aquatox.2004.03.019\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.11.025\n10.1007/s00360-012-0704-5\n10.1086/669265\n10.1242/jeb.080556\n10.1242/jeb.00707\n10.1016/j.niox.2008.10.006\n10.1016/j.cbpb.2005.05.051\n10.1038/35025215\n10.1139/z88-351\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-205\n10.1016/0145-305X(94)90252-6\n10.1007/BF02112361\n10.1016/j.dci.2003.10.003"}

However, the mechanism of diabetes in inducing myocardial injury and apoptosis, and whether the thioredoxin (Trx) system is involved remain unclear. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: the control and the diabetes groups, and then were randomly divided into five different timepoints (the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 12th, and 24th week). The results showed that diabetes-induced cardiac injury was enhanced in the type 2 diabetes rats, as evidenced by aggravated cardiac dysfunction, biochemical indicators, and increased myocardial apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase-3 activity). The activity of myocardial Trx and Trx reductase (TR) in diabetic rats was significantly decreased from the second week and continually aggravated with the disease progression. In diabetic rats, the mRNA expression of Trx1, Trx2, TR1, and TR2 was decreased first and then increased after the fourth week. Meanwhile, the protein expression of these Trx system members was significantly increased at the 12th week. Trx nitration was cleared, the Trx/ASK1 interaction was significantly decreased, and the activity of p38 was significantly enhanced in cardiac tissues at the 12th week. These results demonstrated that diabetes may cause myocardial injury and apoptosis, and the extent of which was accompanied with the development of the disease. The mechanism is associated with the development of diabetes and the decreased activity of Trx and TR. The reasons for decreased Trx activity may include: decrease of Trx and TR protein expression; nitration modification of Trx; and up-regulation of TXNIP expression.", "journal": "Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "date": "2014-03-01", "authors": ["XiaoqinZhao", "YanZhang", "XiaoyuLi", "RuiyuanWang", "XiangyingJiao"], "doi": "10.1093/abbs/gmu006"}

Importantly, JP-49b did not induce characteristic \u03b2-adrenergic agonist-related side effects (e.g., left ventricular damage), which led to the hypothesis that JP-49b systemic exposure was minimal following ocular administration. To test this hypothesis, a sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to study the preclinical pharmacokinetics of JP-49b in rats. Animals received either a single periocular or intravenous injection of JP-49b (10mg/kg) and plasma and tissue samples were obtained. JP-49b and fenoterol hydrobromide (internal standard, IS) were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction and extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a C18 column using a gradient elution (acetic acid in water and methanol). A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the positive electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring was used to detect JP-49b and IS transitions of m/z 346.4\u2192195.1 and 304.1\u2192134.9. The method was validated for selectivity, linearity, accuracy, and precision in rat vitreous humor, tissue homogenates, and plasma. Following intravenous administration, JP-49b was found to have a rapid clearance (36\u00b15.8L/h/kg), high volume of distribution (244\u00b151.5L/kg) and a terminal half-life of 4.8\u00b11.6h. JP-49b was rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed into ocular tissue following topical administration. However, JP-49b was undetectable in heart tissue 24h after ocular administration.

The authors hypothesize that an elastic, biodegradable nanofibrous cardiac patch loaded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) could restrain LV remodeling and improve cardiac function after MI. Poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)/gelatin (PG) nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning, and the nanofibers displayed a porous and uniform nanofibrous structure with a diameter of 244\u00b151nm. An MI model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery of female Sprague-Dawley rats. The PG nanofibrous patch seeded with MSC, isolated from rat bone marrow, was implanted on the epicardium of the infarcted region of the LV wall of the heart. After transplantation, the PG-cell patch restricted the expansion of the LV wall effectively and reduced the scar size, and the density of the microvessels increased. Cells within the patch were able to migrate towards the scar tissue, and promoted new blood vessel formation at the infarct site. Angiogenesis and the cardiac functions improved significantly after 4weeks of implantation. The MSC-seeded PG nanofibrous patches are demonstrated to provide sufficient mechanical support, to induce angiogenesis and to accelerate cardiac repair in a rat model of MI.

{"title": "Is the lack of adiponectin associated with increased ER/SR stress and inflammation in the heart?", "abstract": "Objective To study whether there is an association between adiponectin and endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ERSR) stress. Research design Eleven-month-old male wild-type (WT) and adiponectin knockout (ADKO) mice were placed on chow or high fat diet for 12 weeks. The changes in ER stress and inflammatory genes were determined in the epididymal adipose, as well as heart tissue of adult WT and ADKO mice. To understand the role of ER/SR stress in the regulation of adiponectin, we studied the effect of tunicamycin or palmitate on H9C2 cardiomyoblasts in culture. To demonstrate the protective role of adiponectin, we studied the effect of purified adiponectin on the regulation of ERSR stress genes and inflammation in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts. Results (1) High fat diet increased TNF\u03b1 in adipose tissue of ADKO mice. (2) ERSR stress genes, HSPa5, ERN1, and GADD34, and inflammation response genes, TNF\u03b1 and CD68, were increased in heart of ADKO mice. High fat diet did not further increase the effect. (3) Induction of ERSR stress by tunicamycin in H9C2 resulted in the upregulation of ERSR stress response genes along with downregulation of adiponectin, adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, and Serca2A. ER stress was accompanied by down regulation of I\u043a\u03b2\u03b1 and an increase in HSPa5 proteins. (4) Adiponectin decreased ERSR stress and inflammation response genes and increased Serca2A in to H9C2 cardiomyoblasts.

In the present study, sequence analysis of the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of GATA5, a gene encoding a zinc finger\u2011containing transcriptional factor crucial for cardiogenesis, was performed on genomic DNA isolated from resected cardiac tissue and matched blood samples of 85 unrelated patients who underwent surgical repair of TOF. Genotyping was performed on the cardiac tissue and matched blood samples from 63 unrelated patients who underwent cardiac valve replacement due to rheumatic heart disease as well as the blood samples obtained from 200 unrelated healthy individuals. The functional effect of the mutations was evaluated by using a luciferase reporter assay system. As a result, the novel heterozygous GATA5 mutations, p.D203E and p.Y208X, were found in the cardiac tissues of two TOF patients, respectively. There were no mutations in the cardiac tissues obtained from 63 patients with rheumatic heart disease nor in the blood samples obtained from the 348 subjects.

Ly-6G+ cells were decreased and Ly-6C+ cells were increased in galectin-9-treated mice. In addition, CD11b+Gr-1+ cells were highly effective in suppressing CD4+ T cells. Moreover, our data demonstrate that CD11b+Gr-1+ cells are capable of expanding regulatory T cells (Tregs) from a preexisting population of natural Tregs, which depends on IL-10 but not TGF-\u03b2.

The hearts in various mammals including humans were investigated by both immuno-histochemistry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).Immuno-histochemical studies demonstrated that sheep Purkinje cells in group I had a great number of intermediate filaments of 10 nm positive for desmin antibody. Purkinje cells in group II (humans, monkeys and dogs) and group III (mice) were somewhat larger or smaller in size than myocardial cells, but also showed a strong positive reaction for desmin antibody. The saponin or NaOH treatment of cardiac tissues in sheep and humans enabled us to view intermediate filaments by SEM three-dimensionally. Intermediate filaments in sheep Purkinje cells formed a considerably delicate network, and were distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, those in human Purkinje cells were lower in density, and were present around the nucleus and between myofibrils.

{"title": "How does \u03b2-adrenergic signalling affect the transitions from ventricular tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation?", "abstract": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF) are the most lethal cardiac arrhythmias. The degeneration of VT into VF is associated with the breakup of a spiral wave of the action potential in cardiac tissue. \u03b2-Adrenergic (\u03b2AR) signalling potentiates the L-type Ca current (ICaL) faster than the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs), which transiently prolongs the action potential duration (APD) and promotes early after depolarizations. In this study, we aimed at investigating how \u03b2AR signalling affects the transition from VT to VF.\nWe used a physiologically detailed computer model of the rabbit ventricular myocyte in a two-dimensional tissue to determine how spiral waves respond to \u03b2AR activation following administration of isoproterenol. A simplified mathematical model was also used to investigate the underlying dynamics. We found that the spatiotemporal behaviour of spiral waves strongly depends on the kinetics of \u03b2AR activation. When \u03b2AR activation is rapid, a stable spiral wave turns into small fragments and its electrocardiogram reveals the transition from VT to VF. This is due to the transiently steepened APD restitution induced by the faster activation of ICaL vs. IKs upon sudden \u03b2AR activation. The spiral wave may also disappear if its transient wavelength is too large to be supported by the tissue size upon sudden strong \u03b2AR activation that prolongs APD transiently. When \u03b2AR activation is gradual, a stable spiral wave remains such, because of more limited increase in both APD and slope of APD restitution due to more contemporaneous ICaL and IKs activation.\nChanges in APD restitution during \u03b2AR activation revealed a novel transient spiral wave dynamics; this spatiotemporal characteristic strongly depends on the protocol of isoproterenol application.", "journal": "Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "date": "2014-02-27", "authors": ["YuanfangXie", "EleonoraGrandi", "Donald MBers", "DaisukeSato"], "doi": "10.1093/europace/eut412"}

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), silk, poly-lactic acid (PLA), and polyamide (PA) scaffolds were generated by electrospinning, and cell compatibility in vitro, and immune response and cardiac function in vitro and in vivo were compared with a noncrosslinked collagen membrane (Col) control material. Results showed that cell adhesion and growth of mesenchymal stem cells, cardiomyocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro was dependent on the polymer substrate, with PHB and PCL polymers permitting the greatest adhesion/growth of cells. Additionally, polymer substrates triggered unique expression profiles of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Implantation of PCL, silk, PLA, and PA patches on the epicardial surface of healthy rats induced a classical foreign body reaction pattern, with encapsulation of polymer fibers and induction of the nonspecific immune response, whereas Col and PHB patches were progressively degraded. When implanted on infarcted rat heart, Col, PCL, and PHB reduced negative remodeling, but only PHB induced significant angiogenesis. Importantly, Col and PHB modified the inflammatory response to an M2 macrophage phenotype in cardiac tissue, indicating a more beneficial reparative process and remodeling.

A cardiac patch strategy aims at regenerating an infarcted heart by providing healthy functional cells to the injured region via a carrier substrate, and providing mechanical support, thereby preventing deleterious ventricular remodeling. In the present work, polyaniline (PANI) was doped with camphorsulfonic acid and blended with poly(glycerol-sebacate) at ratios of 10, 20 and 30vol.% PANI content to produce electrically conductive composite cardiac patches via the solvent casting method. The composites were characterized in terms of their electrical, mechanical and physicochemical properties. The in vitro biodegradability of the composites was also evaluated. Electrical conductivity increased from 0Scm(-1) for pure PGS to 0.018Scm(-1) for 30vol.% PANI-PGS samples. Moreover, the conductivities were preserved for at least 100h post fabrication. Tensile tests revealed an improvement in the elastic modulus, tensile strength and elasticity with increasing PANI content. The degradation products caused a local drop in pH, which was higher in all composite samples compared with pure PGS, hinting at a buffering effect due to the presence of PANI. Finally, the cytocompatibility of the composites was confirmed when C2C12 cells attached and proliferated on samples with varying PANI content. Furthermore, leaching of acid dopants from the developed composites did not have any deleterious effect on the viability of C2C12 cells. Taken together, these results confirm the potential of PANI-PGS composites for use as substrates to modulate cellular behavior via electrical stimulation, and as biocompatible scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-02-25", "authors": ["Taimoor HQazi", "RanjanaRai", "DirkDippold", "Judith ERoether", "Dirk WSchubert", "ElisabettaRosellini", "NiccolettaBarbani", "Aldo RBoccaccini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.023"}

Resv and Resv metabolites were analyzed in the negative electrospray ionization mode and eluted with retention times of about 0.69-2.22min with a runtime of 7min. Stable deuterium-labeled Resv and its metabolites were used as the internal standards to correct for matrix effects and to allow for accurate quantification of Resv and its metabolites in a complex biological system. The method was validated with respect to linearity, within- and between-day precision, limit of quantification, recovery, and accuracy for all analytes. Upon examination at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4h post-administration, concentrations of Resv and its metabolites were the highest in the kidney, followed by plasma; specifically, the glucuronidated forms were the most abundant. In the liver and the brain, the predominant forms were the sulfated derivatives. In contrast, heart tissue contained the highest concentration of unmodified Resv at 0.5h post IV administration.

The promising results obtained in terms of improved cardiac function, neo-angiogenesis and reduction in infarct size have motivated the initiation of clinical trials in humans. Despite the potential, the results of these studies have highlighted that the effective delivery and retention of viable cells within the heart remain significant challenges that have limited the therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapies for treating the ischemic myocardium. In this review, we discuss key elements for designing clinically translatable cell-delivery approaches to promote myocardial regeneration.

The propagation velocities found in our model are compared to those in the classic bidomain model and indicate a strong ephaptic microdomain contribution to conduction depending on the parameter regime. We show that ephaptic effects can be quite significant in the junctional spaces between cells, and that the cell activation sequence is modified substantially by these effects. Further, we find that transverse propagation can be maintained by ephaptic effects, even in the absence of gap junctional coupling. The mechanism by which this occurs is found to be cablelike in that the junctional regions act like inverted cables.

This imbalance can contribute to high cardiac collagen content, which increases cross-linking and the stiffness of the myocardium. In this study, the protective effect of phaseolamin against damage under oxidative stress and collagen deposition in the cardiac tissue in association with diabetes was evaluated. Non-diabetic and diabetic animals were distributed into groups and treated for 20 days with commercial phaseolamin. The phaseolamin treatment increased total antioxidant activity but reduced the following in diabetic rats: (a) hyperglycaemic state, (b) catalase and superoxide dismutase activity and (c) tissue damage caused by lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the phaseolamin treatment attenuated the collagen levels compared to non-treated diabetic rats. Thus, the short-term anti-hyperglycaemic effect of the phaseolamin treatment may prevent the initial changes caused by oxidative stress and the deposition of collagen, as well as reduce the incidence of heart complications.", "journal": "Diabetes & vascular disease research", "date": "2014-02-21", "authors": ["Renato J SOliveira", "Vanessa Nde Oliveira", "Simone RDeconte", "Luciana KCal\u00e1bria", "Albertoda Silva Moraes", "Foued SEspindola"], "doi": "10.1177/1479164114521643"}
{"title": "Modeling CaMKII in cardiac physiology: from molecule to tissue.", "abstract": "Post-translational modification of membrane proteins (e.g., ion channels, receptors) by protein kinases is an essential mechanism for control of excitable cell function. Importantly, loss of temporal and/or spatial control of ion channel post-translational modification is common in congenital and acquired forms of cardiac disease and arrhythmia. The multifunctional Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates a number of diverse cellular functions in heart, including excitation-contraction coupling, gene transcription, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of CaMKII signaling has been implicated in human and animal models of disease. Understanding of CaMKII function has been advanced by mathematical modeling approaches well-suited to the study of complex biological systems. Early kinetic models of CaMKII function in the brain characterized this holoenzyme as a bistable molecular switch capable of storing information over a long period of time. Models of CaMKII activity have been incorporated into models of the cell and tissue (particularly in the heart) to predict the role of CaMKII in regulating organ function. Disease models that incorporate CaMKII overexpression clearly demonstrate a link between its excessive activity and arrhythmias associated with congenital and acquired heart disease. This review aims at discussing systems biology approaches that have been applied to analyze CaMKII signaling from the single molecule to intact cardiac tissue. In particular, efforts to use computational biology to provide new insight into cardiac disease mechanisms are emphasized.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2014-02-20", "authors": ["BirceOnal", "Sathya DUnudurthi", "Thomas JHund"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2014.00009\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.01.012\n10.1146/annurev.ph.57.030195.002221\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.07.005\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002551\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.07.038\n10.1529/biophysj.107.118505\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000583\n10.1016/S0097-8485(97)00002-8\n10.1152/physiol.00043.2007\n10.1387/ijdb.082845gd\n10.1016/S0143-4160(03)00152-0\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.048\n10.1038/nature12537\n10.1074/jbc.M313597200\n10.1529/biophysj.107.114868\n10.1074/jbc.M113.497941\n10.1016/0896-6273(94)90306-9\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.07.011\n10.1189/jlb.0107045\n10.1186/gb-2008-9-7-316\n10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00171-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.06.007\n10.1172/JCI43621\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147231.69595.D3\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1758\n10.1186/1472-6793-9-16\n10.1074/jbc.275.19.14354\n10.1038/nrn2807\n10.1073/pnas.0913760107\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.105320\n10.1016/S0925-2312(99)00085-5\n10.1023/A:1013727331979\n10.1073/pnas.83.12.4253\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.018\n10.1021/ar0201207\n10.1073/pnas.82.9.3055\n10.1073/pnas.85.14.5320\n10.1152/ajpheart.01347.2006\n10.1007/s00249-008-0362-4\n10.1172/JCI65268\n10.1006/jmcc.2002.2038\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.06.038\n10.1006/jtbi.1994.1231\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0030107\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.237362\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00013-9\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000426.\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.029\n10.1529/biophysj.108.128728\n10.1126/science.1321493\n10.1126/science.1378648\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.08.016\n10.1074/jbc.M804902200\n10.1016/j.sbi.2013.04.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243956\n10.1172/JCI57833\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.788067\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.11.020\n10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76469-1"}

{"title": "Iron toxicity mediated by oxidative stress enhances tissue damage in an animal model of diabetes.", "abstract": "Although iron is a first-line pro-oxidant that modulates clinical manifestations of various systemic diseases, including diabetes, the individual tissue damage generated by active oxidant insults has not been demonstrated in current animal models of diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that oxidative stress is involved in the severity of the tissues injury when iron supplementation is administered in a model of type 1 diabetes. Streptozotocin (Stz)-induced diabetic and non-diabetic Fischer rats were maintained with or without a treatment consisting of iron dextran ip at 0.1 mL day(-1) doses administered for 4 days at intervals of 5 days. After 3 weeks, an extensive increase (p < 0.001) in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils of the diabetic animals on iron overload was observed. Histological analysis revealed that this treatment also resulted in higher (p < 0.05) tissue iron deposits, a higher (p < 0.001) number of inflammatory cells in the pancreas, and apparent cardiac fibrosis, as shown by an increase (p < 0.05) in type III collagen levels, which result in dysfunctional myocardial. Carbonyl protein modification, a marker of oxidative stress, was consistently higher (p < 0.01) in the tissues of the iron-treated rats with diabetes. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between ROS production and iron pancreas stores (r = 0.42, p < 0.04), iron heart stores (r = 0.54, p < 0.04), and change of the carbonyl protein content in pancreas (r = 0.49, p < 0.009), and heart (r = 0.48, p < 0.02). A negative correlation was still found between ROS production and total glutathione content in pancreas (r = -0.50, p < 0.03) and heart (r = -0.45, p < 0.04).

Recent in-vivo and in-vitro data indicate an important role for Plin5 in the regulation of cardiac lipid storage and function. Targeted overexpression of Plin5 in heart causes steatosis, mild mitochondria dysfunction, and hypertrophy in cardiac tissue, but without affecting cardiac function. In contrast, whole body ablation of Plin5 (Plin5\u200a mice) reduces cardiac lipid droplet formation, increases cardiac fatty acid oxidation, and promotes cardiac dysfunction; cardiac defects can be prevented with antioxidative therapy. These data suggest a cytoprotective role for Plin5 to promote lipid storage but to limit fatty acid toxicity, parameters critical for tissues with high lipid oxidative metabolism.\nIn-vivo and in-vitro data suggest that Plin5 is part of a cell-adaptive response to high lipid oxidative metabolism to protect lipid droplet storage against neutral lipases and, so, limit fatty acid accumulation.

Numerous studies have identified that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is upregulated by CR. However, the expression of SIRT isoforms 2\u20117 in response to CR in cardiomyocytes has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the cellular localization and expression of SIRT1\u20117 in cardiomyocytes. Twenty SD rats were fed either ad libitum (AL) or a CR diet (60% of AL) for three weeks. In addition, H9c2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with either normal\u2011 (4.5 g/l) or low\u2011 (1 g/l) glucose concentrations for 24 h, representing control or CR cells, respectively. CR rats were observed to have significantly lower heart and body weights (BWs) than control rats. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyzes revealed that SIRT1, 3\u20115 and 7 demonstrated similar localization patterns in H9c2 cells and rat cardiac tissues, with SIRT1 and 7 predominantly located in the nucleus and SIRT3\u20115 in the cytoplasm. This was in contrast with SIRT2, which was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm in rat cardiac tissues, but was found predominantly in the nucleus in H9c2 cells. The converse was observed for SIRT6. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that the mRNA expression of SIRT1\u20114 and \u20117 was increased in the CR group. Western blot analysis further revealed that the protein expression of SIRT1\u20114 and \u20117 was significantly increased in the cardiac tissues of rats in the CR group. These results suggest that CR may attenuate age\u2011associated changes through reducing BW.

Our objective was to investigate whether microtubule densification contributes to T-tubule remodeling and excitation-contraction coupling dysfunction in heart disease.\nIn a mouse model of pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy by transaortic banding, colchicine, a microtubule depolymerizer, significantly ameliorated T-tubule remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. In cultured cardiomyocytes, microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole or colchicine profoundly attenuated T-tubule impairment, whereas microtubule polymerization/stabilization with taxol accelerated T-tubule remodeling. In situ immunofluorescence of heart tissue sections demonstrated significant disorganization of junctophilin-2 (JP2), a protein that bridges the T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, in transaortic banded hearts as well as in human failing hearts, whereas colchicine injection significantly preserved the distribution of JP2 in transaortic banded hearts. In isolated mouse cardiomyocytes, prolonged culture or treatment with taxol resulted in pronounced redistribution of JP2 from T-tubules to the peripheral plasma membrane, without changing total JP2 expression. Nocodazole treatment antagonized JP2 redistribution. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of kinesin 1, a microtubule motor protein responsible for anterograde trafficking of proteins, protected against JP2 redistribution and T-tubule remodeling in culture. Finally, nocodazole treatment improved Ca(2+) handling in cultured myocytes by increasing the amplitude of Ca(2+) transients and reducing the frequency of Ca(2+) sparks.\nOur data identify a mechanistic link between microtubule densification and T-tubule remodeling and reveal microtubule-mediated JP2 redistribution as a novel mechanism for T-tubule disruption, loss of excitation-contraction coupling, and heart failure.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2014-02-13", "authors": ["CaimeiZhang", "BiyiChen", "AngGuo", "YanqiZhu", "Jordan DMiller", "ShanGao", "CanYuan", "WilliamKutschke", "KathyZimmerman", "Robert MWeiss", "Xander H TWehrens", "JiangHong", "Frances LJohnson", "Luis FSantana", "Mark EAnderson", "Long-ShengSong"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.008452"}

We aimed to evaluate whether a similar strategy could be used to control cardiac-tissue excitability.\nA combined cell and gene therapy strategy was developed in which fibroblasts were transfected to express the light-activated depolarizing channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Patch-clamp studies confirmed the development of a robust inward current in the engineered fibroblasts following monochromatic blue-light exposure. The engineered cells were co-cultured with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (or human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) and studied using a multielectrode array mapping technique. These studies revealed the ability of the ChR2-fibroblasts to electrically couple and pace the cardiomyocyte cultures at varying frequencies in response to blue-light flashes. Activation mapping pinpointed the source of this electrical activity to the engineered cells. Similarly, diffuse seeding of the ChR2-fibroblasts allowed multisite optogenetics pacing of the co-cultures, significantly shortening their electrical activation time and synchronizing contraction. Next, optogenetics pacing in an in vitro model of conduction block allowed the resynchronization of the tissue's electrical activity. Finally, the ChR2-fibroblasts were transfected to also express the light-sensitive hyperpolarizing proton pump Archaerhodopsin-T (Arch-T). Seeding of the ChR2/ArchT-fibroblasts allowed to either optogentically pace the cultures (in response to blue-light flashes) or completely suppress the cultures' electrical activity (following continuous illumination with 624 nm monochromatic light, activating ArchT).\nThe results of this proof-of-concept study highlight the unique potential of optogenetics for future biological pacemaking and resynchronization therapy applications and for the development of novel anti-arrhythmic strategies.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2014-02-13", "authors": ["UdiNussinovitch", "RamiShinnawi", "LiorGepstein"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvu037"}

Using a PTSD mouse model, we investigated the longitudinal transcriptomic changes in heart tissues after the exposure to stress through intimidation. Our results revealed acute heart injury associated with the traumatic experience, reflecting the underlying biological injury processes of the immune response, extracellular matrix remodeling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transitions, and cell proliferation. Whether this type of injury has any long-term effects on heart function is yet to be determined. The differing responses to stress leading to acute heart injury in different inbred strains of mice also suggest that this response has a genetic as well as an environmental component.

It is unknown whether CDCs derived from advanced heart failure (HF) patients retain the same regenerative potency.\nIn a mouse model of acute MI, we compared the regenerative potential and functional benefits of CDCs derived from 3 groups: 1) non-failing (NF) donor: healthy donor hearts post-transplantation; 2) MI: patients who had an MI 9 to 35 days before biopsy; and 3) HF: advanced cardiomyopathy tissue explanted at cardiac transplantation.\nCell growth and phenotype were identical in all 3 groups. Injection of HF CDCs led to the greatest therapeutic benefit in mice, with the highest left ventricular ejection fraction, thickest infarct wall, most viable tissue, and least scar 3 weeks after treatment. In vitro assays revealed that HF CDCs secreted higher levels of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1, which may contribute to the cells' augmented resistance to oxidative stress, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved myocyte survival. Histological analysis indicated that HF CDCs engrafted better, recruited more endogenous stem cells, and induced greater angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte cell-cycle re-entry.

Matrix stiffness, one of the many mechanical factors acting on cells, is increasingly appreciated as an important mediator of myocardial cell behavior. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates were fabricated with different stiffnesses to mimic physiological and pathological heart tissues, and the way in which the elastic modulus of the substrate regulated matrix-degrading gelatinases in myocardial cells and cardiac fibroblasts was explored. Initially, an increase in cell spreading area was observed, concomitant with the increase in PDMS stiffness in both cells. Later, it was demonstrated that the MMP-2 gene expression and protein activity in myocardial cells and cardiac fibroblasts can be enhanced with an increase in PDMS substrate stiffness and, moreover, such gene- and protein-related increases had a significant linear correlation with the elastic modulus. In comparison, the MMP-9 gene and protein expressions were up-regulated in cardiac fibroblasts only, not in myocardial cells. These results implied that myocardial cells and cardiac fibroblasts in the myocardium could sense the stiffness in pathological fibrosis and showed a differential but positive response in the expression of matrix-degrading gelatinases when exposed to an increased stiffening of the matrix in the microenvironment.

Brown adipose derived stem cells (BADSCs) present a new source of cardiomyocytes to regenerate the myocardium after infarction. In this study, we explored an injectable tissue engineering strategy to repair damaged myocardium, in which chitosan hydrogels were investigated as a carrier for BADSCs. In vitro, the effect and mechanism of chitosan components on the cardiac differentiation of BADSCs were investigated. In vivo, BADSCs carrying double-fusion reporter gene (firefly luciferase and monomeric red fluorescent protein (fluc-mRFP)) were transplanted into infarcted rat hearts with or without chitosan hydrogel. Multi-techniques were used to assess the effects of treatments. We observed that chitosan components significantly enhanced cardiac differentiation of BADSCs, which was assessed by percentages of cTnT(+) cells and expression of cardiac-specific markers, including GATA-4, Nkx2.5, Myl7, Myh6, cTnI, and Cacna1a. Treatment with collagen synthesis inhibitors, cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline (CIS), significantly inhibited the chitosan-enhanced cardiac differentiation, indicating that the enhanced collagen synthesis by chitosan accounts for its promotive role in cardiac differentiation of BADSCs. Longitudinal in vivo bioluminescence imaging and histological staining revealed that chitosan enhanced the survival of engrafted BADSCs and significantly increased the differentiation rate of BADSCs into cardiomyocytes in vivo.

{"title": "Genome-wide analysis of functional and evolutionary features of tele-enhancers.", "abstract": "We investigated sequence features of enhancers separated from their target gene by at least one intermediate gene/exon (named tele-enhancers in this study) and enhancers residing inside their target gene locus. In this study, we used whole genome enhancer maps and gene expression profiles to establish a large panel of tele-enhancers. By contrasting tele-enhancers to proximal enhancers targeting heart genes, we observed that heart tele-enhancers use unique regulatory mechanisms based on the cardiac transcription factors SRF, TEAD, and NKX-2.5, whereas proximal heart enhancers rely on GATA4 instead. A functional analysis showed that tele-enhancers preferentially regulate house-keeping genes and genes with a metabolic role during heart development. In addition, tele-enhancers are significantly more conserved than their proximal counterparts. Similar trends have been observed for non-heart tissues and cell types, suggesting that our findings represent general characteristics of tele-enhancers.", "journal": "G3 (Bethesda, Md.)", "date": "2014-02-06", "authors": ["DiHuang", "IvanOvcharenko"], "doi": "10.1534/g3.114.010447"}

Here, we describe a method for purification of nuclei from defined cell or tissue types in vertebrate embryos using INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types). This method, previously developed in plants, flies and worms, utilizes in vivo tagging of the nuclear envelope with biotin and the subsequent affinity purification of the labeled nuclei. In this study we successfully purified nuclei of cardiac and skeletal muscle from Xenopus using this strategy. We went on to demonstrate the utility of this approach by coupling the INTACT approach with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic methodologies to profile proteins expressed in the nuclei of developing hearts. From these studies we have identified the Xenopus orthologs of 12 human proteins encoded by genes, which when mutated in human lead to congenital heart disease. Thus, by combining these technologies we are able to identify tissue-specific proteins that are expressed and required for normal vertebrate organ development.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2014-02-06", "authors": ["Nirav MAmin", "Todd MGreco", "Lauren MKuchenbrod", "Maggie MRigney", "Mei-IChung", "John BWallingford", "Ileana MCristea", "Frank LConlon"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.098327"}
{"title": "Differential regulation of DNA methylation versus histone acetylation in cardiomyocytes during HHcy in vitro and in vivo: an epigenetic mechanism.", "abstract": "The mechanisms of homocysteine-mediated cardiac threats are poorly understood. Homocysteine, being the precursor to S-adenosyl methionine (a methyl donor) through methionine, is indirectly involved in methylation phenomena for DNA, RNA, and protein. We reported previously that cardiac-specific deletion of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-1 (NMDAR1) ameliorates homocysteine-posed cardiac threats, and in this study, we aim to explore the role of NMDAR1 in epigenetic mechanisms of heart failure, using cardiomyocytes during hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). High homocysteine levels activate NMDAR1, which consequently leads to abnormal DNA methylation vs. histone acetylation through modulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), HDAC1, miRNAs, and MMP9 in cardiomyocytes. HL-1 cardiomyocytes cultured in Claycomb media were treated with 100 \u03bcM homocysteine in a dose-dependent manner. NMDAR1 antagonist (MK801) was added in the absence and presence of homocysteine at 10 \u03bcM in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of DNMT1, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), NMDAR1, microRNA (miR)-133a, and miR-499 was assessed by real-time PCR as well as Western blotting. Methylation and acetylation levels were determined by checking 5'-methylcytosine DNA methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Hyperhomocysteinemic mouse models (CBS+/-) were used to confirm the results in vivo. In HHcy, the expression of NMDAR1, DNMT1, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 increased with increase in H3K9 acetylation, while HDAC1, miR-133a, and miR-499 decreased in cardiomyocytes. Similar results were obtained in heart tissue of CBS+/- mouse. High homocysteine levels instigate cardiovascular remodeling through NMDAR1, miR-133a, miR-499, and DNMT1. A decrease in HDAC1 and an increase in H3K9 acetylation and DNA methylation are suggestive of chromatin remodeling in HHcy.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2014-02-06", "authors": ["PankajChaturvedi", "AnuradhaKalani", "SrikanthGivvimani", "Pradip KumarKamat", "AnastasiaFamiltseva", "Suresh CTyagi"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00168.2013"}
{"title": "[From precursor to reprogrammed cells: evolution of cardiomyoplasty].", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is underoxygenation-driven limited necrosis of heart tissues which results in elimination of ca. 0.5 to 1 billion spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes (CM). Since the ability of human heart to regenerate is limited, efforts have been undertaken to increase the number of cardiomyocytes in post-infarction myocardium. Theoretically, such proposals might involve transplantation of 1) skeletal myoblasts and cardiomyocytes, or 2) progenitor/stem cells, theoretically capable of differentiating into cardiomyocytes, or 3) pluripotent cells such as embryonal stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) differentiating into cardiomyocytes. The efforts to increase CM could also involve 4) in situ reprogramming of fibroblasts into active cardiomyocyte-like cells, or 5) stimulating in situ proliferation of cardiomyocytes using pharmacological agents. Only three proposals merit closer scrutiny (2, 4 and 5). However, preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated weak ability of progenitor cells to differentiate (proposal 2). Nevertheless, transplanted cell-induced paracrine effects accompanying such therapy do improve functioning of the damaged heart muscle. The proposals that would permit the number of CM to be increased include in situ reprogramming of fibroblasts into active cardiomyocytes (proposal 4), as well as in situ stimulation of quiescent cardiomyocytes' proliferation (proposal 5).

Fifty-nine days after the last administration of sporozoites and 32 days after the last dose of chloroquine the volunteer underwent controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by the bites of five P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. Eleven days post-CHMI a thick blood smear was positive (6 P. falciparum/\u03bcL blood) and treatment was initiated with atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone\u00ae). On the second day of treatment, day 12 post-CHMI, troponin T, a marker for cardiac tissue damage, began to rise above normal, and reached a maximum of 1,115\u00a0ng/L (upper range of normal\u2009=\u200914\u00a0ng/L) on day 16 post-CHMI. The volunteer had one ~20\u00a0minute episode of retrosternal chest pain and heavy feeling in his left arm on day 14 post-CHMI.

Furthermore, when the expression of ABCC6 was reduced to approximately 38% of wild-type levels in Abcc6+/\u2212 mice, no calcium deposits in injured cardiac tissue were observed. In addition, we used a gene therapy approach to deliver a functional human ABCC6 via hydrodynamic tail vein injection to approximately 13% of mouse hepatocytes, significantly reducing the calcification response to cardiac cryoinjury. We observed that the level and distribution of known regulators of mineralization, such as osteopontin and matrix Gla protein, but not osteocalcin, were concomitant to the level of hepatic expression of human and mouse ABCC6. We notably found that undercarboxylated matrix Gla protein precisely colocalized within areas of mineralization, whereas osteopontin was more diffusely distributed in the area of injury, suggesting a prominent association for matrix Gla protein and osteopontin in ABCC6-related dystrophic cardiac calcification.

{"title": "Electrical conditioning of adipose-derived stem cells in a multi-chamber culture platform.", "abstract": "In tissue engineering, several factors play key roles in providing adequate stimuli for cells differentiation, in particular biochemical and physical stimuli, which try to mimic the physiological microenvironments. Since electrical stimuli are important in the developing heart, we have developed an easy-to-use, cost-effective cell culture platform, able to provide controlled electrical stimulation aimed at investigating the influence of the electric field in the stem cell differentiation process. This bioreactor consists of an electrical stimulator and 12 independent, petri-like culture chambers and a 3-D computational model was used to characterize the distribution and the intensity of the electric field generated in the cell culture volume. We explored the effects of monophasic and biphasic square wave pulse stimulation on a mouse adipose-derived stem cell line (m17.ASC) comparing cell viability, proliferation, protein, and gene expression. Both monophasic (8 V, 2 ms, 1 Hz) and biphasic (+4 V, 1 ms and -4 V, 1 ms; 1 Hz) stimulation were compatible with cell survival and proliferation. Biphasic stimulation induced the expression of Connexin 43, which was found to localize also at the cell membrane, which is its recognized functional mediating intercellular electrical coupling. Electrically stimulated cells showed an induced transcriptional profile more closely related to that of neonatal cadiomyocytes, particularly for biphasic stimulation. The developed platform thus allowed to set-up precise conditions to drive adult stem cells toward a myocardial phenotype solely by physical stimuli, in the absence of exogenously added expensive bioactive molecules, and can thus represent a valuable tool for translational applications for heart tissue engineering and regeneration.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2014-01-30", "authors": ["APavesi", "MSoncini", "AZamperone", "SPietronave", "EMedico", "ARedaelli", "MPrat", "G BFiore"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.25201"}
{"title": "Electrospun PLGA fibers incorporated with functionalized biomolecules for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Structural similarity of electrospun fibers (ESFs) to the native extracellular matrix provides great potential for the application of biofunctional ESFs in tissue engineering. This study aimed to synthesize biofunctionalized poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) ESFs for investigating the potential for cardiac tissue engineering application. We developed a simple but novel strategy to incorporate adhesive peptides in PLGA ESFs. Two adhesive peptides derived from laminin, YIGSR, and RGD, were covalently conjugated to poly-L-lysine, and then mingled with PLGA solution for electrospinning. Peptides were uniformly distributed on the surface and in the interior of ESFs. PLGA ESFs incorporated with YIGSR or RGD or adsorbed with laminin significantly enhanced the adhesion of cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal rats. Furthermore, the cells were found to adhere better on ESFs compared with flat substrates after 7 days of culture. Immunofluorescent staining of F-actin, vinculin, a-actinin, and N-cadherin indicated that cardiomyocytes adhered and formed striated \u03b1-actinin better on the laminin-coated ESFs and the YIGSR-incorporated ESFs compared with the RGD-incorporated ESFs. The expression of \u03b1-myosin heavy chain and \u03b2-tubulin on the YIGSR-incorporated ESFs was significantly higher compared with the expression level on PLGA and RGD-incorporated samples. Furthermore, the contraction of cardiomyocytes was faster and lasted longer on the laminin-coated ESFs and YIGSR-incorporated ESFs. The results suggest that aligned YIGSR-incorporated PLGA ESFs is a better candidate for the formation of cardiac patches.

{"title": "In vivo vascularization of cell sheets provided better long-term tissue survival than injection of cell suspension.", "abstract": "Cell sheets have shown a remarkable ability for repairing damaged myocardium in clinical and preclinical studies. Although they demonstrate a high degree of viability as engrafted cells in vivo, the reason behind their survivability is unclear. In this study, the survival and vascularization of rat cardiac cell sheets transplanted in the subcutaneous tissue of athymic rats were investigated temporally. The cell sheets showed significantly higher survival than cell suspensions for up to 12 months, using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system to detect luciferase-positive transplanted cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay also showed a smaller number of apoptotic cells in the cell sheets than in the cell suspensions at 1 day. Rapid vascular formation and maturation were observed inside the cell sheets using an in vivo imaging system. Leaky vessels appeared at 6 h, red blood cells flowing through functional vessels appeared at 12 h, and morphologically matured vessels appeared at 7 days. In addition, immunostaining of cell sheets with nerve/glial antigen-2 (NG2) showed that vessel maturity increased over time. Interestingly, these results correlated with the dynamics of cell sheet mRNA expression. Genes related to endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting were highly expressed within 1 day, and genes related to pericyte recruitment and vessel maturation were highly expressed at 3 days or later. This suggested that the cell sheets could secrete appropriate angiogenic factors in a timely way after transplantation, and this ability might be a key reason for their high survival.

Different chemical modalities (i.e. methods or agents), ranging from small molecules and RNA approaches (including both microRNA and anti-microRNA) to modified peptides and proteins, are showing potential to meet this medical need.

Adult male Wistar albino rats were assigned to one of the six treatment groups: Rats in group 1 (control) and group 2 (L-carnitine) were injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) with normal saline and L-carnitine (200\u00a0mg/kg/day), respectively, for 10 successive days. Animals in group 3 (CP group) were injected i.p. with normal saline for 5\u00a0days before and 5\u00a0days after a single dose of CP (200\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). Rats in group 4 (IFO group) received normal saline for 5 successive days followed by IFO (50\u00a0mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 5 successive days. Rats in group 5 (CP-carnitine supplemented) were given the same doses of L-carnitine as group 2 for 5\u00a0days before and 5\u00a0days after a single dose of CP as group 3. Rats in group 6 (IFO-carnitine supplemented) were given the same doses of L-carnitine as group 2 for 5\u00a0days before and 5\u00a0days concomitant with IFO as group 4. Immediately, after the last dose of the treatment protocol, blood samples were withdrawn and animals were killed for biochemical, histopathological and gene expression studies. Treatment with CP and IFO significantly decreased expression of heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) genes in cardiac tissues. Moreover, CP but not IFO significantly increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase2 mRNA expression. Conversely, IFO but not CP significantly decreased mRNA expression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Both CP and IFO significantly increased serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB and malonyl-CoA content and histopathological lesions in cardiac tissues. Interestingly, carnitine supplementation completely reversed all the biochemical, histopathological and gene expression changes induced by CP and IFO to the control values, except CPT I mRNA, and protein expression remained inhibited by IFO. Data from the current study suggest, for the first time, that (1) CP and IFO therapy is associated with the inhibition of the expression of H-FABP and CPT I genes in cardiac tissues with the consequent inhibition of mitochondrial transport and oxidation of LCFA. (2) The progressive increase in cardiotoxicity enzymatic indices and the decrease in H-FABP and CPT I expression may point to the possible contribution of these genes to CP- and IFO-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2014-01-29", "authors": ["Mohamed MSayed-Ahmed", "Meshan LAldelemy", "Othman AAl-Shabanah", "Mohamed MHafez", "Khaled AAl-Hosaini", "Naif OAl-Harbi", "Shakir DAl-Sharary", "Mohamed MAl-Harbi"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-014-9247-1"}

Previously, we had generated a truncated analog of ghrelin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate for the purposes of determining GHS-R expression in situ. We now report the generation and characterization of a far-red ghrelin analog, [Dpr(3)(octanoyl), Lys(19)(Cy5)]ghrelin (1-19), and show that it can be used to image changes in GHS-R in developing cardiomyocytes. We also generated the des-acyl analog, des-acyl [Lys(19)(Cy5)]ghrelin (1-19) and characterized its binding to mouse heart sections. Receptor binding affinity of Cy5-ghrelin as measured in HEK293 cells overexpressing GHS-R1a was within an order of magnitude of that of fluorescein-ghrelin and native human ghrelin, while the des-acyl Cy5-ghrelin did not bind GHS-R1a. Live cell imaging in HEK293/GHS-R1a cells showed cell surface labeling that was displaced by excess ghrelin. Interestingly, Cy5-ghrelin, but not the des-acyl analog, showed concentration-dependent binding in mouse heart tissue sections. We then used Cy5-ghrelin to track GHS-R expression in P19-derived cardiomyocytes. Live cell imaging at different time points after DMSO-induced differentiation showed that GHS-R expression preceded that of the differentiation marker aMHC and tracked with the contractility marker SERCA 2a.

It is overexpressed in ischemic cardiac tissues. Down-regulation of miR-1 could relieve arrhythmogenesis by the anti-miR-1 antisense oligonucleotides (AMO-1). To increase the therapeutic efficiency and inhibit off-target effects of AMO-1, here we explored anti-cardiac troponin I (cTnI) antibody modified liposomes loading with AMO-1 (cT-A-LIP) to deliver the oligonucleotides to ischemic myocardium tissues. Liposomal cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay. The targeting abilities to foci were evaluated by in vivo imaging. The uptake and bio-distribution in vitro were observed by live cell station and flow cytometry, respectively. The anti-arrhythmic effects of cT-A-LIP in vivo were evaluated by electrocardiograms (ECG), immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and patch-clamp recording. Immunohistochemistry showed that cTnI expression had a peak at the third day after myocardial infarction (MI). After cT-LIP administration via tail vein, accumulation of fluorescent trackers in the ischemic foci was significantly increased more than that of LIP. In addition, after cT-A-LIP administration, the ischemic arrhythmias were recovered and ST segment in ECG was elevated nearly back to normal. Compared with MI group, miR-1 expression was significantly down-regulated while Kir2.1 and CX43 protein expression were increased. Patch-clamp recordings showed that cT-A-LIP as well as AMO-1 incubation increased K(+) current density in guinea pigs ventricular cardiomyocytes acting on repolarized membrane potential.

Despite its demonstrated cardioprotective activity, the bioaccumulation of RSV or its metabolites in cardiac tissue is still unknown.\nDiabetic rats were randomized to 1, 3 or 6 weeks of RSV treatment at two different doses (1 or 5\u00a0mg/kg/day). A dose and time-dependent accumulation was observed, with no detectable levels of RSV metabolites found in heart tissues after 1 week and significant concentrations of RSV-3-sulfate and RSV-3-glucuronide after 6 weeks of treatment (0.05\u00a0nmol/g of tissue and 0.01\u00a0nmol/g of tissue, respectively). Tissue accumulation of RSV metabolites was accompanied by an improvement of cardiac function in long-term diabetes, when myocardial morpho-functional damage is more evident, with an almost complete recovery of all hemodynamic parameters, at the highest RSV dose.\nEven if a higher concentration of RSV in tissues cannot be ruled out after constant oral administration, an accumulation coherent with what is usually evaluated in cell based mechanistic studies is largely unattainable and the RSV unconjugated form would not be present in this paradigm. The current investigation provides data on myocardial tissue concentrations of RSV metabolites, after short/medium term RSV treatment.

This study was designed to compare infiltration, proliferation, and cardiac differentiation potential of menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) versus bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in Bombyx mori-derived silk scaffold. Our primary data revealed that the fabricated scaffold has mechanical and physical qualities suitable for cardiac tissue engineering. The MenSCs tracking in scaffolds using immunofluorescent staining and scanning electron microscopy confirmed MenSCs attachment, penetration, and distribution within the porous scaffold matrix. Based on proliferation assay using propidium iodide DNA quantification, the significantly higher level of growth rates of both MenSCs and BMSCs was documented in scaffolds than that in two-dimensional culture (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The expression level of TNNT2, a bona fide cardiac differentiation marker, in BMSCs differentiated on silk scaffolds was markedly higher than those cultured in two-dimensional culture indicating the improvement of cardiac differentiation in the silk scaffolds. Furthermore, differentiated MenSCs exhibited higher expression of TNNT2 compared with induced BMSCs. It seems that silk scaffold-seeded MenSCs could be viewed as a novel, safe, natural, and accessible construct for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2014-01-22", "authors": ["MaryamRahimi", "HomaMohseni-Kouchesfehani", "Amir-HassanZarnani", "SahbaMobini", "ShohrehNikoo", "SomaiehKazemnejad"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328213519835"}

However, TRPM1, TRPM3, TRPM5, and TRPM8 were not expressed in heart tissue.

Assembly of individual fibrillar components in the ECM, such as collagen, elastin, and fibronectin, is understood at the molecular level. In contrast, the incorporation of non-fibrillar components and their functions in the ECM are not fully understood.\nThis review will focus on the role of the matricellular protein thrombospondin (TSP) 2 in ECM assembly. Based on findings in TSP2-null mice and in vitro studies, we describe the participation of TSP2 in ECM assembly, cell-ECM interactions, and modulation of the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).\nEvidence summarized in this review suggests that TSP2 can influence collagen fibrillogenesis without being an integral component of fibrils. Altered ECM assembly and excessive breakdown of ECM can have both positive and negative consequences including increased angiogenesis during tissue repair and compromised cardiac tissue integrity, respectively.\nProper ECM assembly is critical for maintaining cell functions and providing structural support. Lack of TSP2 is associated with increased angiogenesis, in part, due to altered endothelial cell-ECM interactions. Therefore, minor changes in ECM composition can have profound effects on cell and tissue function.

{"title": "Rapid upregulation and clearance of distinct circulating microRNAs after prolonged aerobic exercise.", "abstract": "Short nonprotein coding RNA molecules, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), are intracellular mediators of adaptive processes, including muscle hypertrophy, contractile force generation, and inflammation. During basal conditions and tissue injury, miRNAs are released into the bloodstream as \"circulating\" miRNAs (c-miRNAs). To date, the impact of extended-duration, submaximal aerobic exercise on plasma concentrations of c-miRNAs remains incompletely characterized. We hypothesized that specific c-miRNAs are differentially upregulated following prolonged aerobic exercise. To test this hypothesis, we measured concentrations of c-miRNAs enriched in muscle (miR-1, miR-133a, miR-499-5p), cardiac tissue (miR-208a), and the vascular endothelium (miR-126), as well as those important in inflammation (miR-146a) in healthy male marathon runners (N = 21) at rest, immediately after a marathon (42-km foot race), and 24 h after the race. In addition, we compared c-miRNA profiles to those of conventional protein biomarkers reflective of skeletal muscle damage, cardiac stress and necrosis, and systemic inflammation. Candidate c-miRNAs increased immediately after the marathon and declined to prerace levels or lower after 24 h of race completion. However, the magnitude of change for each c-miRNA differed, even when originating from the same tissue type. In contrast, traditional biomarkers increased after exercise but remained elevated 24 h postexercise. Thus c-miRNAs respond differentially to prolonged exercise, suggesting the existence of specific mechanisms of c-miRNA release and clearance not fully explained by generalized cellular injury. Furthermore, c-miRNA expression patterns differ in a temporal fashion from corollary conventional tissue-specific biomarkers, emphasizing the potential of c-miRNAs as unique, real-time markers of exercise-induced tissue adaptation.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2014-01-18", "authors": ["Aaron LBaggish", "JosephPark", "Pil-KiMin", "StephanieIsaacs", "Beth AParker", "Paul DThompson", "ChrisTroyanos", "PierreD'Hemecourt", "SophiaDyer", "MarissaThiel", "AndrewHale", "Stephen YChan"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.01141.2013"}

During normal angiogenesis, endothelial cells (ECs) require a support cell to form mature patent lumens and it has been demonstrated that pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all able to support the formation of mature vessels. In the heart, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) provide important electrical and mechanical functions, but to date have not been sufficiently studied for their role in angiogenesis. To study CFs role in angiogenesis, we co-cultured different concentrations of various cell types in fibrin hemispheres with appropriate combinations of their specific media, to determine the optimal conditions for EC growth and sprout formation through DNA analysis, flow cytometry and immunohistology. ECs proliferated best when co-cultured with CFs and analysis of immunohistological images demonstrated that ECs formed the longest and most numerous sprouts with CFs as compared to MSCs. However, ECs were able to produce more multicellular sprouts when in culture with the MSCs. Moreover, these effects were dependent on the ratio of support cell to EC in co-culture. Overall, CFs provide a good support system for EC proliferation and sprout formation; however, MSCs allow for more multicellular sprouts, which is more indicative of the in vivo process.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2014-01-18", "authors": ["Rachel LTwardowski", "Lauren DBlack"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-014-0971-2"}

This study sought to investigate the inhibitory effect of two varieties of ginger (Zingiber officinale) commonly consumed in Nigeria on ACE activity in rats fed a high cholesterol diet. The inhibition of ACE activity of two varieties of ginger (Z. officinale) was investigated in a high cholesterol (2%) diet fed to rats for 3 days. Feeding high cholesterol diets to rats caused a significant (P<.05) increase in the ACE activity. However, there was a significant (P<.05) inhibition of ACE activity as a result of supplementation with the ginger varieties. Rats that were fed 4% white ginger had the greatest inhibitory effect as compared with a control diet. Furthermore, there was a significant (P<.05) increase in the plasma lipid profile with a concomitant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content in rat liver and heart tissues. However, supplementing the diet with red and white ginger (either 2% or 4%) caused a significant (P<.05) decrease in the plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and in MDA content in the tissues. Conversely, supplementation caused a significant (P<.05) increase in plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level when compared with the control diet. Nevertheless, rats fed 4% red ginger had the greatest reduction as compared with control diet. In conclusion, both ginger varieties exhibited anti-hypercholesterolemic properties in a high cholesterol diet fed to rats. This activity of the gingers may be attributed to its ACE inhibitory activity. However, white ginger inhibited ACE better in a high cholesterol diet fed to rats than red ginger.

Transduction efficiency was \u223c100%, and radioligand binding revealed 70% lower \u03b2(1)-AR density in AAV6-shB1-transduced EHTs. Force measurements, performed over the culture period of 14 days, showed paradoxically higher force generation in AAV6-shB1 compared with shCTR under basal (0.19 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.13 \u00b1 0.01 mN) and after \u03b2-AR-stimulated conditions with isoprenaline (\u0394fractional shortening: 72 \u00b1 5% versus 34 \u00b1 4%). Large scale gene expression analysis revealed that AAV6-shCTR compared with nontransduced EHTs showed only few differentially regulated genes (<20), whereas AAV6-shB1 induced marked changes in gene expression (>250 genes), indicating that \u03b2(1)-AR knockdown itself determines the outcome. None of the regulated genes pointed to obvious off-target effects to explain higher force generation. Moreover, compensational regulation of \u03b2(2)-AR signaling or changes in prominent \u03b2(1)-AR downstream targets could be ruled out. In summary, we show paradoxically higher force generation and isoprenaline responses after efficient \u03b2(1)-AR knockdown in EHTs.

This study was designed to construct engineered heart tissue (EHT) as a three-dimensional model in vitro to better understand the role of telocytes in the architectural organization of the myocardium. EHTs were constructed by seeding neonatal cardiomyocytes in collagen/Matrigel scaffolds followed by culture under persistent static stretch. Telocytes in EHTs were identified by histology, toluidine blue staining, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. The results from histology and toluidine blue staining demonstrated widespread putative telocytes with compact toluidine blue-stained nuclei, which were located around cardiomyocytes. Prolongations from the cell bodies showed a characteristic dichotomous branching pattern and formed networks in EHTs. Immunofluorescence revealed positive staining of telocytes for CD34 and vimentin with typical moniliform prolongations. A series of electron microscopy images further showed that typical telocytes embraced the cardiomyocytes with their long prolongations and exhibited a marked appearance of nursing cardiomyocytes during the construction of EHTs. This finding highlights the great importance of telocytes in the architectural organization of EHTs.

However, it is unclear whether preventing macrophages from entering cardiac tissue would provide similar or additional protection in this disease setting. Therefore, we examined mineralocorticoid-induced cardiovascular disease in mice lacking the CCL2 gene (encoding monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), which have a markedly reduced capacity to recruit proinflammatory tissue macrophages. Male wild-type (WT) and CCL2-null mice were treated for 8 days or 8 weeks with either vehicle (control, CON) or deoxycorticosterone (DOC). At both time points, there was a significant reduction in DOC-induced macrophage recruitment (50% at 8 d and 75% at 8 wk) in the heart with a corresponding suppression of cardiac inflammatory markers in the CCL2-null mice. CCL2-null mice given DOC/salt also displayed 35% less cardiac fibrosis at 8 weeks vs WT DOC. Absence of recruited macrophages in CCL2-null mice promotes greater collagen breakdown by matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the heart and also leads to significantly reduced cardiac fibroblast and myofibroblast numbers. Systolic blood pressure (BP) after DOC/salt was significantly lower in CCL2-null than for WT mice. In the aorta at 8 weeks, MR-responsive gene expression remained intact. However, macrophage-mediated proinflammatory gene expression was reduced in the CCL2-null mice and may account for differential regulation of BP.

{"title": "A study of early afterdepolarizations in a model for human ventricular tissue.", "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death is often caused by cardiac arrhythmias. Recently, special attention has been given to a certain arrhythmogenic condition, the long-QT syndrome, which occurs as a result of genetic mutations or drug toxicity. The underlying mechanisms of arrhythmias, caused by the long-QT syndrome, are not fully understood. However, arrhythmias are often connected to special excitations of cardiac cells, called early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are depolarizations during the repolarizing phase of the action potential. So far, EADs have been studied mainly in isolated cardiac cells. However, the question on how EADs at the single-cell level can result in fibrillation at the tissue level, especially in human cell models, has not been widely studied yet. In this paper, we study wave patterns that result from single-cell EAD dynamics in a mathematical model for human ventricular cardiac tissue. We induce EADs by modeling experimental conditions which have been shown to evoke EADs at a single-cell level: by an increase of L-type Ca currents and a decrease of the delayed rectifier potassium currents. We show that, at the tissue level and depending on these parameters, three types of abnormal wave patterns emerge. We classify them into two types of spiral fibrillation and one type of oscillatory dynamics. Moreover, we find that the emergent wave patterns can be driven by calcium or sodium currents and we find phase waves in the oscillatory excitation regime. From our simulations we predict that arrhythmias caused by EADs can occur during normal wave propagation and do not require tissue heterogeneities. Experimental verification of our results is possible for experiments at the cell-culture level, where EADs can be induced by an increase of the L-type calcium conductance and by the application of I[Formula: see text] blockers, and the properties of the emergent patterns can be studied by optical mapping of the voltage and calcium.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-01-16", "authors": ["NeleVandersickel", "Ivan VKazbanov", "AnitaNuitermans", "Louis DWeise", "RahulPandit", "Alexander VPanfilov"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0084595"}

Histological analysis demonstrated a greater proportion of cardiac troponin T-expressing cells in stretched than non-stretched constructs, and flow sorting demonstrated a higher proportion of cardiomyocytes. Ultrastructural assessment showed that cells in stretched constructs had a more mature phenotype, characterized by greater cell elongation, increased gap junction expression, and better contractile elements. Real-time PCR revealed enhanced mRNA expression of genes associated with cardiac maturation as well as genes encoding cardiac ion channels.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with aliskiren (10 mg/kg per day) and valsartan (30 mg/kg per day), alone or in combination, together with the B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (0.5 mg/kg per day) or the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (30 mg/kg per day), for 4 weeks before myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Aliskiren increased cardiac bradykinin levels and attenuated valsartan-induced increases in plasma angiotensin II levels. In vehicle-treated rats, myocardial infarct size (% area at risk, mean\u00b1SEM, n=7-13) was 43\u00b13%.

{"title": "Albumin fiber scaffolds for engineering functional cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "In recent years attempts to engineer contracting cardiac patches were focused on recapitulation of the myocardium extracellular microenvironment. We report here on our work, where for the first time, a three-dimensional cardiac patch was fabricated from albumin fibers. We hypothesized that since albumin fibers' mechanical properties resemble those of cardiac tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) and their biochemical character enables their use as protein carriers, they can support the assembly of cardiac tissues capable of generating strong contraction forces. Here, we have fabricated aligned and randomly oriented electrospun albumin fibers and investigated their structure, mechanical properties, and chemical nature. Our measurements showed that the scaffolds have improved elasticity as compared to synthetic electrospun PCL fibers, and that they are capable of adsorbing serum proteins, such as laminin leading to strong cell-matrix interactions. Moreover, due to the functional groups on their backbone, the fibers can be chemically modified with essential biomolecules. When seeded with rat neonatal cardiac cells the engineered scaffolds induced the assembly of aligned cardiac tissues with high aspect ratio cardiomyocytes and massive actinin striation. Compared to synthetic fibrous scaffolds, cardiac cells cultured within aligned or randomly oriented scaffolds formed functional tissues, exhibiting significantly improved function already on Day 3, including higher beating rate (P\u2009=\u20090.0002 and P\u2009<\u20090.0001, respectively), and higher contraction amplitude (P\u2009=\u20090.009 and P\u2009=\u20090.003, respectively).

{"title": "Electrically conductive chitosan/carbon scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "In this work, carbon nanofibers were used as doping material to develop a highly conductive chitosan-based composite. Scaffolds based on chitosan only and chitosan/carbon composites were prepared by precipitation. Carbon nanofibers were homogeneously dispersed throughout the chitosan matrix, and the composite scaffold was highly porous with fully interconnected pores. Chitosan/carbon scaffolds had an elastic modulus of 28.1 \u00b1 3.3 KPa, similar to that measured for rat myocardium, and excellent electrical properties, with a conductivity of 0.25 \u00b1 0.09 S/m. The scaffolds were seeded with neonatal rat heart cells and cultured for up to 14 days, without electrical stimulation. After 14 days of culture, the scaffold pores throughout the construct volume were filled with cells. The metabolic activity of cells in chitosan/carbon constructs was significantly higher as compared to cells in chitosan scaffolds. The incorporation of carbon nanofibers also led to increased expression of cardiac-specific genes involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling. This study demonstrates that the incorporation of carbon nanofibers into porous chitosan scaffolds improved the properties of cardiac tissue constructs, presumably through enhanced transmission of electrical signals between the cells.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2014-01-15", "authors": ["Ana MMartins", "GeorgeEng", "Sofia GCaridade", "Jo\u00e3o FMano", "Rui LReis", "GordanaVunjak-Novakovic"], "doi": "10.1021/bm401679q"}

{"title": "A quantitative comparison of the behavior of human ventricular cardiac electrophysiology models in tissue.", "abstract": "Numerical integration of mathematical models of heart cell electrophysiology provides an important computational tool for studying cardiac arrhythmias, but the abundance of available models complicates selecting an appropriate model. We study the behavior of two recently published models of human ventricular action potentials, the Grandi-Pasqualini-Bers (GPB) and the O'Hara-Vir\u00e1g-Varr\u00f3-Rudy (OVVR) models, and compare the results with four previously published models and with available experimental and clinical data. We find the shapes and durations of action potentials and calcium transients differ between the GPB and OVVR models, as do the magnitudes and rate-dependent properties of transmembrane currents and the calcium transient. Differences also occur in the steady-state and S1-S2 action potential duration and conduction velocity restitution curves, including a maximum conduction velocity for the OVVR model roughly half that of the GPB model and well below clinical values. Between single cells and tissue, both models exhibit differences in properties, including maximum upstroke velocity, action potential amplitude, and minimum diastolic interval. Compared to experimental data, action potential durations for the GPB and OVVR models agree fairly well (although OVVR epicardial action potentials are shorter), but maximum slopes of steady-state restitution curves are smaller. Although studies show alternans in normal hearts, it occurs only in the OVVR model, and only for a narrow range of cycle lengths. We find initiated spiral waves do not progress to sustained breakup for either model. The dominant spiral wave period of the GPB model falls within clinically relevant values for ventricular tachycardia (VT), but for the OVVR model, the dominant period is longer than periods associated with VT. Our results should facilitate choosing a model to match properties of interest in human cardiac tissue and to replicate arrhythmia behavior more closely.

{"title": "Acute slowing of cardiac conduction in response to myofibroblast coupling to cardiomyocytes through N-cadherin.", "abstract": "The electrophysiological consequences of cardiomyocyte and myofibroblast interactions remain unclear, and the contribution of mechanical coupling between these two cell types is still poorly understood. In this study, we examined the time course and mechanisms by which addition of myofibroblasts activated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) influence the conduction velocity (CV) of neonatal rat ventricular cell monolayers. We observed that myofibroblasts affected CV within 30 min of contact and that these effects were temporally correlated with membrane deformation of cardiomyocytes by the myofibroblasts. Expression of dominant negative RhoA in the myofibroblasts impaired both myofibroblast contraction and myofibroblast-induced slowing of cardiac conduction, whereas overexpression of constitutive RhoA had little effect. To determine the importance of mechanical coupling between these cell types, we examined the expression of the two primary cadherins in the heart (N- and OB-cadherin) at cell-cell contacts formed between myofibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Although OB-cadherin was frequently found at myofibroblast-myofibroblast contacts, very little expression was observed at myofibroblast-cardiomyocyte contacts. The myofibroblast-induced slowing of cardiac conduction was not prevented by silencing of OB-cadherin in the myofibroblasts, and could be reversed by inhibitors of mechanosensitive channels (gadolinium or streptomycin) and cellular contraction (blebbistatin). In contrast, N-cadherin expression was commonly observed at myofibroblast-cardiomyocyte contacts, and silencing of N-cadherin in myofibroblasts prevented the myofibroblast-dependent slowing of cardiac conduction. We propose that myofibroblasts can impair the electrophysiological function of cardiac tissue through the application of contractile force to the cardiomyocyte membrane via N-cadherin junctions.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2014-01-15", "authors": ["Susan AThompson", "AdrianaBlazeski", "Craig RCopeland", "Daniel MCohen", "Christopher SChen", "Daniel MReich", "LeslieTung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.025"}

More than 80% exhibited downregulation toward the embryonic expression pattern and showed a DM1-specific response. A total of 20 of 22 miRNAs tested were also significantly downregulated in human DM1 heart tissue. We demonstrate that many of these miRNAs are direct MEF2 transcriptional targets, including miRNAs for which depletion is associated with arrhythmias or fibrosis. MEF2 protein is significantly reduced in both DM1 and mouse model heart samples, and exogenous MEF2C restores normal levels of MEF2 target miRNAs and mRNAs in a DM1 cardiac cell culture model.

A total of 860 and 2007 proteins were identified in the iTRAQ and label-free experiments respectively.

Further analysis indicated that hypoxia is associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), whereas subsequent re-oxygenation was instead associated with modified secretion of proteins involved in suppression of inflammation, ECM modification, and decreased output of anti-apoptosis proteins.

The identified changes in cardiomyocyte secretome advance our current understanding of cardiac biology in ischemia/reperfusion injury and may lead to the identification of novel prognostic biomarker.\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Myocardial infarction (MI) resulting from ischemic heart disease represents a substantial component of CVD-associated mortality, and is associated with obstruction of blood flow to the myocardium. Restoration of blood flow through the occluded coronary artery is the current most effective therapy to limit infarct size and preserve cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction. However, this treatment does not prevent subsequent development of heart failure in some patients. Reperfusion following ischemia causes additional cell death and increase in infarct size, a phenomenon called myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.

Immunohistochemical staining methods were used to localize apelin, APJR and TUNEL immunopositive cells. H-SCORE was used for semi-quantitative determinations. Apelin protein levels were determined by Western blot in the cardiac tissues and plasma corticosteroid levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Apelin immunolocalization was found especially in endothelial cells and mast cells and faintly in cardiomyocytes, APJR immunostaining was shown in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and TUNEL reaction was observed in endothelial cells and in some fibroblasts. Apelin expression was significantly increased in the WIRS and F13A+WIRS groups compared to the control group. The APJR reaction was similar in all groups. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly higher in the F13A+WIRS group than that of the control group.

{"title": "Mimicking isovolumic contraction with combined electromechanical stimulation improves the development of engineered cardiac constructs.", "abstract": "Electrical and mechanical stimulation have both been used extensively to improve the function of cardiac engineered tissue as each of these stimuli is present in the physical environment during normal development in vivo. However, to date, there has been no direct comparison between electrical and mechanical stimulation and current published data are difficult to compare due to the different systems used to create the engineered cardiac tissue and the different measures of functionality studied as outcomes. The goals of this study were twofold. First, we sought to directly compare the effects of mechanical and electrical stimulation on engineered cardiac tissue. Second, we aimed to determine the importance of the timing of the two stimuli in relation to each other in combined electromechanical stimulation. We hypothesized that delaying electrical stimulation after the beginning of mechanical stimulation to mimic the biophysical environment present during isovolumic contraction would improve construct function by improving proteins responsible for cell-cell communication and contractility. To test this hypothesis, we created a bioreactor system that would allow us to electromechanically stimulate engineered tissue created from neonatal rat cardiac cells entrapped in fibrin gel during 2 weeks in culture. Contraction force was higher for all stimulation groups as compared with the static controls, with the delayed combined stimulation constructs having the highest forces. Mechanical stimulation alone displayed increased final cell numbers but there were no other differences between electrical and mechanical stimulation alone. Delayed combined stimulation resulted in an increase in SERCA2a and troponin T expression levels, which did not happen with synchronous combined stimulation, indicating that the timing of combined stimulation is important to maximize the beneficial effect. Increases in Akt protein expression levels suggest that the improvements are at least in part induced by hypertrophic growth.

Ca(2+) influx, release and diffusion produce a cytosolic Ca(2+) transient. Here, we investigated the relationship between Ca(2+) transients and the spatial arrangement of the sarcolemma including the transverse tubular system (t-system). To accomplish this, we studied isolated ventricular myocytes of rabbit, which exhibit a heterogeneously distributed t-system. We developed protocols for fluorescent labeling and triggered two-dimensional confocal microscopic imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution. From sequences of microscopic images, we measured maximal upstroke velocities and onset times of local Ca(2+) transients together with their distance from the sarcolemma. Analyses indicate that not only sarcolemmal release sites, but also those that are within 1 \u03bcm of the sarcolemma actively release Ca(2+). Our data also suggest that release does not occur at sites further than 2.5 \u03bcm from the sarcolemma.

{"title": "Time course label-free quantitative analysis of cardiac muscles of rats after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a worldwide cause of mortality and morbidity and is the ultimate ending of a variety of complex diseases. This reflects our incomplete understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms and furthermore increases the complexity of the disease. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of heart failure, we investigated dynamic proteomic differences between the heart tissue of myocardial infarction rats and the rats in the sham group at days 4, 14, 28, 45 after operation. Using a label-free quantitative proteomic approach based on nanoscale ultra-performance liquid chromatography-ESI-MS(E), 133 proteins were identified at the four time points in 8 groups. 13 non-redundant proteins changed dynamically after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in rat left ventricular (LV) tissue, including cytoskeletal proteins, metabolic enzymes, oxidative stress related proteins and ion channel proteins. The network analysis showed that the differential protein might play an important role in lipid metabolism and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The dynamic changes in the expression of beta-actin, alpha B-crystallin (CryAB), heat shock protein 8(HSP8), desmin and l-lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) were tested by the western-blot assay, and the results were consistent with the label-free quantitative proteomic results. Correlative analysis indicates that the CryAB and desmin have a better linear relation with heart function (ejection fraction) than cardiac troponin T (cTNT). Our results provide the first experimental evidence of the proteins that are differentially expressed following myocardial infarction, using time-course label-free quantitative proteomics in vivo without ischemia-reperfusion injury or myocardial ischemia. These differential functional proteins (especially CryAB and desmin) have different patterns during the myocardial infarction, which may partially account for the underlying mechanisms involved in cardiac rehabilitation.", "journal": "Molecular bioSystems", "date": "2014-01-03", "authors": ["ChunLi", "QiQiu", "YongWang", "PingLi", "ChengXiao", "HongxiaWang", "YangLin", "WeiWang"], "doi": "10.1039/c3mb70422j"}

{"title": "Nitrite as Direct S-Nitrosylating Agent of Kir2.1 Channels.", "abstract": "Nitrite, a physiological nitric oxide (NO) storage form and an alternative way for NO generation, affects numerous biological processes through NO-dependent and independent pathways, including the S-nitrosylation of thiol-containing proteins. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to analyse in the rat heart (as prototype of mammalian heart) whether nitrite affects S-nitrosylation of cardiac proteins and the potential targets for S-nitrosylation. Rat hearts, perfused according to Langendorff, were exposed to nitrite. By Biotin Switch Method, we showed that nitrite treatment increased the degree of S-nitrosylation of a broad range of membrane proteins. Further analysis, conducted on subfractioned proteins, allowed us to identify a high level of nitrosylation in a small range of plasmalemmal proteins characterized by using an anti-Kir2.1 rabbit polyclonal antibody. We also verified that this effect of nitrite is preserved in the presence of the NO scavenger PTIO (2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide). Our results suggest, for the first time, that nitrite represents a direct S-nitrosylating agent in cardiac tissues and that inward-rectifier potassium ion channels (Kir2.1) are one of the targets.

Cell therapy has emerged as a promising new approach to the treatment of heart failure, with very encouraging experimental results. Since 2000, when human stem cell therapy was first attempted in France, clinical trials with adult stem cells (myoblasts, bone-marrow derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells) have given variable results. The inconsistent and modest therapeutic benefit observed in these studies is due more to paracrine effects than to the hoped-for cell replacement, as adult stem cells do not turn into cardiomyocytes and their survival rate after transplantation is very low. In order to be effective, cell therapy should use heart muscle cells derived from pluri- or multipotent cells (human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, resident cardiac cells), which are likely to have a higher survival rate in a hostile biological environment and deteriorated tissue scaffold. Cardiac tissue engineering assisted by nanotechnologies may eventually help to meet this challenge.", "journal": "Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine", "date": "2014-01-01", "authors": ["MichelDesnos"], "doi": null}

Mast cells have been identified in human heart between myocardial fibers, perivascularly, in the adventitia, and in the arterial intima. Mast cells isolated from human heart tissue (HHMC) of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation express high affinity immunglobulin E (IgE) receptors (Fc\u03b5RI), C3a, C5a, and kit receptors (KIT). Anti-IgE, anti-Fc\u03b5RI, and immunoglobulin superallergens induce in vitro secretion of preformed mediators (histamine, tryptase, chymase, and renin) and the de novo synthesis of cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) from HHMC. Complement is activated and anaphylatoxin forms during anaphylaxis. C5a and C3a cause the in vitro release of histamine and tryptase from HHMC. Therapeutic (general anesthetics, protamine, etc.) and diagnostic agents (radio contrast media, etc.), which can cause anaphylactoid reactions, activate HHMC in vitro.

Gap junction channels are essential in normal heart function and they assist in the mediated spread of electrical impulses that stimulate synchronized contraction (via an electrical syncytium) of cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Pharmacological and genetic identification of serotonin receptor subtypes on Drosophila larval heart and aorta.", "abstract": "Serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), plays various roles in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Previous studies have shown that 5-HT modulates the heart rate in third instar larvae. However, the receptor subtypes that mediate 5-HT action in larval cardiac tissue had yet to be determined. In this study, various 5-HT agonists and antagonists were employed to determine which 5-HT receptor subtypes are responsible for the positive chronotropic effect by 5-HT. The pharmacological results demonstrate that a 5-HT2B agonist significantly increases the heart rate; however, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT7 agonists do not have a significant effect on the heart rate. Furthermore, 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin, markedly reduces the positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT in a dose-response manner. Furthermore, we employed genetic approaches to confirm the pharmacological results. For this purpose, we used RNA interference line to knock down 5-HT2ADro and also used 5-HT2ADro and 5-HT2BDro insertional mutation lines. The results show that 5-HT2ADro or 5-HT2BDro receptor mutations reduce the response of the heart to 5-HT.

This study aimed to clarify the expression pattern of NCAM in human cardiomyopathy.\nA total of 64 cardiac tissue samples of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were dichotomized according to the immunohistochemically determined signal intensity of NCAM staining (NCAM-high and NCAM-low groups). Clinical and hemodynamic data of the patients were compared between the 2 groups. Fibrosis area, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, and left ventricular diastolic pressure were greater in the NCAM-high group (22.8% versus 11.6%, P<0.05; 130.3\u00b157.6 versus 104.8\u00b131.7 mL/m(2), P<0.05; 14.3\u00b18.0 versus 8.8\u00b14.7 mm Hg, P<0.005; respectively). Incidence of cardiac death and admission for worsening heart failure was higher in the NCAM-high group during a follow-up of 6.3 years (log-rank P<0.05). Another 18 tissue samples were analyzed to determine the relationships between expression level of NCAM and major metabolic genes as well as hemodynamic parameters. The mRNA level of NCAM correlated with the serum (r=0.58; P=0.01) and mRNA levels (r=0.61; P=0.008) of brain-derived natriuretic peptides.

Recent evidence clearly prompted that radiation-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) would play a key role in bystander responses in nontargeted cells. Accordingly, we investigated the orchestration of NF-\u03baB signaling after IR in a nontargeted distant organ. Heart tissues from C57/BL6 mice either mock irradiated or exposed (limited to lower abdomen 1 cm diameter) to single-dose IR (SDR: 2 or 10 Gy) or fractionated IR (FIR, 2 Gy per day for 5 days) were examined for onset of abscopal NF-\u03baB signal transduction, translated activity, downstream functional signaling and associated DNA damage. Radiation significantly induced NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity in nontargeted heart. Transcriptional profiling showed that 51, 46 and 26 of 88 genes were significantly upregulated after 2 Gy, 10 Gy and FIR. Of these genes, 22 showed dose- and fractionation-independent upregulation. Immunohistochemistry revealed a robust increase in p65 and cMyc expression in distant heart after SDR and FIR. Immunoblotting revealed increased phosphorylation of p38 after 2 Gy and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 after 10 Gy in nontargeted heart. In addition, IR exposure significantly enhanced DNA fragmentation in nontargeted heart. Together, these data clearly indicated an induced abscopal response in distant organ after clinically relevant IR doses.

In the present study, we reported that MSCs could release a large quantity of EVs around 100\u00a0nm in diameter upon hypoxia stimulation though the majority of the cells had not experienced apoptosis.

In this study we investigated whether NGF synthesis by CG neurons is altered in heart failure, and whether norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons promotes NGF synthesis. NGF and proNGF immunoreactivity in CG neurons in heart failure rats following chronic coronary artery ligation was investigated. NGF immunoreactivity was decreased significantly in heart failure rats compared to sham-operated animals, whereas proNGF expression was unchanged. Changes in neurochemistry of CG neurons included attenuated expression of the cholinergic marker vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and increased expression of the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.

About 200 different mutations in the cMyBP-C gene (MYBPC3) have thus far been reported as causing HCM. Among them, a 25 base pair deletion in the branch point of intron 32 of MYBPC3 is widespread, particularly affecting people of South Asian descent, with 4% of this population carrying the mutation. This polymorphic mutation results in skipping of exon 33 and a reading frame shift, which, in turn, replaces the last 65 amino acids of the C-terminal C10 domain of cMyBP-C with a novel sequence of 58 residues (cMyBP-C(C10mut)). Carriers of the 25 base pair deletion mutation are at increased risk of developing cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Because of the high prevalence of this mutation in certain populations, genetic screening of at-risk groups might be beneficial. Scientifically, the functional consequences of C-terminal mutations and the precise mechanisms leading to HCM should be defined using induced pluripotent stem cells and engineered heart tissue in vitro or mouse models in vivo. Most importantly, therapeutic strategies that include pharmacology, gene repair, and gene therapy should be developed to prevent the adverse clinical effects of cMyBP-C(C10mut). This review article aims to examine the effects of cMyBP-C(C10mut) on cardiac function, emphasizing the need for the development of genetic testing and expanded therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2013-12-12", "authors": ["Diederik W DKuster", "SakthivelSadayappan"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-013-1417-7"}
{"title": "Mesenchymal stem cell secreted platelet derived growth factor exerts a pro-migratory effect on resident Cardiac Atrial appendage Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) modulate cardiac healing after myocardial injury through the release of paracrine factors, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown. One possible mechanism is through mobilization of endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs). This study aimed to test the pro-migratory effect of MSC conditioned medium (MSC-CM) on endogenous CSCs from human cardiac tissue. By using a three-dimensional collagen assay, we found that MSC-CM improved migration of cells from human cardiac tissue. Cell counts, perimeter and area measurements were utilized to quantify migration effects. To examine whether resident stem cells were among the migrating cells, specific stem cell properties were investigated. The migrating cells displayed strong similarities with resident Cardiac Atrial appendage Stem Cells (CASCs), including a clonogenic potential of ~21.5% and expression of pluripotency associated genes like Oct-4, Nanog, c-Myc and Klf-4. Similar to CASCs, migrating cells demonstrated high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and were able to differentiate towards cardiomyocytes. Receptor tyrosine kinase analysis and collagen assays performed with recombinant platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and Imatinib Mesylate, a PDGF receptor inhibitor, suggested a role for the PDGF-AA/PDGF receptor \u03b1 axis in enhancing the migration process of CASCs. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that factors present in MSC-CM improve migration of resident stem cells from human cardiac tissue. These data open doors towards future therapies in which MSC secreted factors, like PDGF-AA, can be utilized to enhance the recruitment of CASCs towards the site of myocardial injury.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2013-12-12", "authors": ["SeverinaWindmolders", "AstridDe Boeck", "RemcoKoninckx", "AnnickDani\u00ebls", "OlivierDe Wever", "MarcBracke", "MarcHendrikx", "KarenHensen", "Jean-LucRummens"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.016"}

However, the regulation of heart rate during embryonic development is still not clear. The aim of this study was to determine how endothelin-1 (ET-1) affects the heart rate of embryonic mice, as well as the pathway through which it exerts its effects.\nThe effects of ET-1 and ET-1 receptor inhibition on cardiac contraction were studied using confocal Ca(2+) imaging of isolated mouse embryonic ventricular cardiomyocytes and ultrasonographic examination of embryonic cardiac contractions in utero. In addition, the amount of ET-1 peptide and ET receptor a (ETa) and b (ETb) mRNA levels were measured during different stages of development of the cardiac muscle.\nHigh ET-1 concentration and expression of both ETa and ETb receptors was observed in early cardiac tissue. ET-1 was found to increase the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in E10.5 embryonic cardiomyocytes in vitro. Non-specific inhibition of ET receptors with tezosentan caused arrhythmia and bradycardia in isolated embryonic cardiomyocytes and in whole embryonic hearts both in vitro (E10.5) and in utero (E12.5). ET-1-mediated stimulation of early heart rate was found to occur via ETb receptors and subsequent inositol trisphosphate receptor activation and increased SR Ca(2+) leak.\nEndothelin-1 is required to maintain a sufficient heart rate, as well as to prevent arrhythmia during early development of the mouse heart.

{"title": "Imaging of lipids in rat heart by MALDI-MS with silver nanoparticles.", "abstract": "Lipids are a major component of heart tissue and perform several important functions such as energy storage, signaling, and as building blocks of biological membranes. The heart lipidome is quite diverse consisting of glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), cardiolipins (CLs), and glycerolipids, mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs). In this study, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enabled by matrix implantation of ionized silver nanoparticles (AgNP) was used to map several classes of lipids in heart tissue. The use of AgNP matrix implantation was motivated by our previous work showing that implantation doses of only 10(14)/cm(2) of 2 nm gold nanoparticulates into the first 10 nm of the near surface of the tissue enabled detection of most brain lipids (including neutral lipid species such as cerebrosides) more efficiently than traditional organic MALDI matrices. Herein, a similar implantation of 500 eV AgNP(-) across the entire heart tissue section results in a quick, reproducible, solvent-free, uniform matrix concentration of 6 nm AgNP residing near the tissue surface. MALDI-MSI analysis of either positive or negative ions produce high-quality images of several heart lipid species. In negative ion mode, 24 lipid species [16 PEs, 4 PIs, 1 PG, 1 CL, 2 sphingomyelins (SMs)] were imaged.

Recent studies evidenced the beneficial role of phytochemicals in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Hence the present study was framed to investigate the protective role of Gallic acid (GA) on AGEs induced cardiac fibrosis. Rats were infused with in vitro prepared AGEs (50mg/kg BW-intravenous injection) for 30 days. Further, GA (25mg/kgBW) was administered to rats along with AGEs. On infusion of AGEs, induction of fibrotic markers, collagen deposition, oxidative marker NADPH oxidase (NOX-p47 phox subunit), AGE receptor (RAGE) and cytokines expression was evaluated in the heart tissues using RT-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining methods. AGEs infusion significantly (P<0.01) increased the HW/BW ratio and fibrosis (4-fold) with increased expression of matrix genes MMP-2 and -9 (P<0.01, respectively) in the heart tissues. Whereas, administration of GA along with AGEs infusion prevented the fibrosis induced by AGEs. Further, GA treatment effectively prevented the AGEs mediated up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes and ECM proteins such as TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, MMP-2 and -9 expression. In addition, the increased expression of NOX (P<0.01), RAGE (P<0.01), NF-\u03baB (P<0.01) and ERK 1/2 on AGEs infusion were normalized by GA treatment.

This peptide was used to tune biodegradability properties, since the Alanine-Alanine sequence is a target for the elastase enzyme. Enzymatic degradation tests demonstrated the feasibility of tuning biodegradability properties due to the introduction of AAK peptide in polyurethane backbone. Two formulations have been processed into porous scaffolds by Thermally-Induced Phase Separation (TIPS). Scanning Electron Microscopy micrographs revealed promising microstructures, which were characterized by stretched and unidirectional pores and mimicked the striated muscle tissue. Tensile tests showed that, although scaffolds are characterized by lower mechanical properties than films, these substrates have suitable elastomeric behaviors and elastic moduli for contractile and soft tissue regeneration. Viability tests on cardiomyocytes revealed the best cell response for dense film and porous scaffold obtained from PCL and Lysine Ethyl Ester-based polyurethane, with an increased viability for the porous substrate, which is ascribable to the morphological features of its microstructure.

{"title": "Hypoxia-induced epigenetic modifications are associated with cardiac tissue fibrosis and the development of a myofibroblast-like phenotype.", "abstract": "Ischemia caused by coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction leads to aberrant ventricular remodeling and cardiac fibrosis. This occurs partly through accumulation of gene expression changes in resident fibroblasts, resulting in an overactive fibrotic phenotype. Long-term adaptation to a hypoxic insult is likely to require significant modification of chromatin structure in order to maintain the fibrotic phenotype. Epigenetic changes may play an important role in modulating hypoxia-induced fibrosis within the heart. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the potential pro-fibrotic impact of hypoxia on cardiac fibroblasts and determine whether alterations in DNA methylation could play a role in this process. This study found that within human cardiac tissue, the degree of hypoxia was associated with increased expression of collagen 1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA). In addition, human cardiac fibroblast cells exposed to prolonged 1% hypoxia resulted in a pro-fibrotic state. These hypoxia-induced pro-fibrotic changes were associated with global DNA hypermethylation and increased expression of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Expression of these methylating enzymes was shown to be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1. Using siRNA to block DNMT3B expression significantly reduced collagen 1 and ASMA expression. In addition, application of the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine suppressed the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF\u03b2. Epigenetic modifications and changes in the epigenetic machinery identified in cardiac fibroblasts during prolonged hypoxia may contribute to the pro-fibrotic nature of the ischemic milieu.

GPx-1(-/-) mice on a C57 black 6 (C57BL/6) background at 2, 6, and 12 months of age were used. Vascular function was significantly impaired in 12-month-old GPx-1(-/-) -mice as compared with age-matched controls. Oxidant formation, detected by 3-nitrotyrosine staining and dihydroethidine-based fluorescence microtopography, was increased in the aged GPx-1(-/-) mice. Aging per se caused a substantial protein kinase C- and protein tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation as well as S-glutathionylation of endothelial NO synthase associated with uncoupling, a phenomenon that was more pronounced in aged GPx-1(-/-) mice. GPx-1 ablation increased adhesion of leukocytes to cultured endothelial cells and CD68 and F4/80 staining in cardiac tissue. Aged GPx-1(-/-) mice displayed increased oxidant formation as compared with their wild-type littermates, triggering redox-signaling pathways associated with endothelial NO synthase dysfunction and uncoupling.

This study evaluated the capacity of an aligned, fibrin-based, stretch-conditioned cardiac patch consisting of either the native population or a cardiomyocyte (CM)-depleted population (i.e., CM+ or CM- patches) of neonatal rat heart cells to ameliorate left ventricular (LV) remodeling in the acute-phase postinfarction in syngeneic, immunocompetent rats. Patches were exposed to 7 days of static culture and 7 days of cyclic stretching prior to implantation. Within 1 week of implantation, both patches became vascularized, and non-CMs began migrating from CM+ patches. By week 4, patches had been remodeled into collagenous tissue, and live, elongated, donor CMs were found within grafted CM+ patches. Significant improvement in cardiac contractile function was seen with the administration of the CM+ patch (ejection fraction increased from 35.1% \u00b1 4.0% for MI only to 58.8% \u00b1 7.3% with a CM+ patch, p<0.05) associated with a 77% reduction in infarct size (61.3% \u00b1 7.9% for MI only, 13.9% \u00b1 10.8% for CM+ patch, p<0.05), and the elimination of LV free-wall thinning. Decreased infarct size and reduced wall thinning also occurred with the administration of the CM- patch (infarct size 36.9% \u00b1 10.2%, LV wall thickness: 1058.2 \u00b1 135.4 \u03bcm for CM- patch, 661.3 \u00b1 37.4 \u03bcm for MI only, p<0.05), but without improvements in cardiac function. Approximately 36.5% of the transplanted CMs survived at 4 weeks; however, they remained separated and electrically uncoupled from the host myocardium by a layer of CM-free tissue, which suggests that the benefits of CM+ patch transplantation resulted from paracrine mechanisms originating from CMs. Collectively, these observations suggest that the transplantation of CM-containing engineered heart tissue patches can lead to dramatic improvements in cardiac function and remodeling after acute MI.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The composition, morphology and mechanical properties of the compound scaffolds, composed of varying ratios of PCL and hydrogel were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analyzer. The elastic modulus of PCL/BPAEDMA nanofibrous scaffolds was shown to be varying the BPAEDMA weight fraction and was decreased by increasing the BPAEDMA weight fraction. Compound fiber meshes containing 75 wt % BPAEDMA oligomer hydrogel exhibited lower modulus (3.55 MPa) and contact angle of 25(o) . Rabbit cardiac cells cultured for 10 days on these PCL/BPAEDMA compound nanofibrous scaffolds remained viable and expressed cardiac troponin and alpha-actinin proteins for the normal functioning of myocardium. Cell adhesion and proliferations were significantly increased on compound fiber meshes containing 75 wt % BPAEDMA, when compared with other nanofibrous scaffolds.

{"title": "Human-specific hypomethylation of CENPJ, a key brain size regulator.", "abstract": "Both the enlarged brain and concurrent highly developed cognitive skills are often seen as distinctive characteristics that set humans apart from other primates. Despite this obvious differentiation, the genetic mechanisms that underlie such human-specific traits are not clearly understood. In particular, whether epigenetic regulations may play a key role in human brain evolution remain elusive. In this study, we used bisulfite sequencing to compare the methylation patterns of four known genes that regulate brain size (ASPM, CDK5RAP2, CENPJ, and MCPH1) in the prefrontal cortex among several primate species spanning the major lineages of primates (i.e., humans, great apes, lesser apes, and Old World monkeys). The results showed a human-specific hypomethylation in the 5' UTR of CENPJ in the brain, where methylation levels among humans are only about one-third of those found among nonhuman primates. Similar methylation patterns were also detected in liver, kidney, and heart tissues, although the between-species differences were much less pronounced than those in the brain. Further in vitro methylation assays indicated that the methylation status of the CENPJ promoter could influence its expression. We also detected a large difference in CENPJ expression in the human and nonhuman primate brains of both adult individuals and throughout the major stages of fetal brain development. The hypomethylation and comparatively high expression of CENPJ in the central nervous system of humans suggest that a human-specific--and likely heritable--epigenetic modification likely occurred during human evolution, potentially leading to a much larger neural progenitor pool during human brain development, which may have eventually contributed to the dramatically enlarged brain and highly developed cognitive abilities associated with humans.", "journal": "Molecular biology and evolution", "date": "2013-11-30", "authors": ["LeiShi", "QiangLin", "BingSu"], "doi": "10.1093/molbev/mst231"}
{"title": "Diuretics prevent thiazolidinedione-induced cardiac hypertrophy without compromising insulin-sensitizing effects in mice.", "abstract": "Much concern has arisen regarding critical adverse effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), including rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, on cardiac tissue. Although TZD-induced cardiac hypertrophy (CH) has been attributed to an increase in plasma volume or a change in cardiac nutrient preference, causative roles have not been established. To test the hypothesis that volume expansion directly mediates rosiglitazone-induced CH, mice were fed a high-fat diet with rosiglitazone, and cardiac and metabolic consequences were examined. Rosiglitazone treatment induced volume expansion and CH in wild-type and PPAR\u03b3 heterozygous knockout (Pparg(+/-)) mice, but not in mice defective for ligand binding (Pparg(P465L/+)). Cotreatment with the diuretic furosemide in wild-type mice attenuated rosiglitazone-induced CH, hypertrophic gene reprogramming, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, hypertrophy-related signal activation, and left ventricular dysfunction. Similar changes were observed in mice treated with pioglitazone. The diuretics spironolactone and trichlormethiazide, but not amiloride, attenuated rosiglitazone effects on volume expansion and CH. Interestingly, expression of glucose and lipid metabolism genes in the heart was altered by rosiglitazone, but these changes were not attenuated by furosemide cotreatment. Importantly, rosiglitazone-mediated whole-body metabolic improvements were not affected by furosemide cotreatment. We conclude that releasing plasma volume reduces adverse effects of TZD-induced volume expansion and cardiac events without compromising TZD actions in metabolic switch in the heart and whole-body insulin sensitivity.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2013-11-30", "authors": ["Cherng-ShyangChang", "Pei-JaneTsai", "Junne-MingSung", "Ju-YiChen", "Li-ChunHo", "KumarPandya", "NobuyoMaeda", "Yau-ShengTsai"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.10.020"}
{"title": "Therapeutic potential of midkine in cardiovascular disease.", "abstract": "Ischaemic heart disease, stroke and their pathological consequences are life-threatening conditions that account for about half of deaths in developed countries. Pathology of these diseases includes cell death due to ischaemia/reperfusion injury, vascular stenosis and cardiac remodelling. The growth factor midkine plays a pivotal role in these events. Midkine shows an acute cytoprotective effect in ischaemia/reperfusion injury at least in part via its anti-apoptotic effect. Moreover, while midkine promotes endothelial cell proliferation, it also recruits inflammatory cells to lesions. These activities eventually enhance angiogenesis, thereby preventing cardiac tissue remodelling. However, midkine's activity in recruiting inflammatory cells into the vascular wall also triggers neointima formation, and consequently, vascular stenosis. Moreover, midkine is induced in cancer tissues where it enhances angiogenesis. Therefore, midkine may promote tumour formation through its angiogenic and anti-apoptotic activity. This review focuses on the roles of midkine in ischaemic cardiovascular disease and their pathological consequences, that is angiogenesis, vascular stenosis, and cardiac remodelling, and discusses the possible therapeutic potential of modulation of midkine in these diseases.\nThis article is part of a themed section on Midkine.

Over the past two decades many studies have been conducted to understand stem cell performance, survival, and the potential for cardiac repair.

They are associated with significant reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and mortality, which suggests a surgical modification on cardiac metabolism. Metabolic phenotyping of the cardiac tissue and plasma postsurgery may give insight into cardioprotective mechanisms. The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and heart tissue extracts from RYGB- and sham-operated Wistar rats to identify the systemic and cardiac signature of metabolic surgery. A total of 27 male Wistar rats were housed individually for a week and subsequently underwent RYGB (n = 13) or sham (n = 14) operation. At week 8 postoperation, a total of 27 plasma samples and 16 heart tissue samples (8 RYGB; 8 Sham) were collected from animals and analyzed using (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-MS) to characterize the global metabolite perturbation induced by RYGB operation. Plasma bile acids, phosphocholines, amino acids, energy-related metabolites, nucleosides and amine metabolites, and cardiac glycogen and amino acids were found to be altered in the RYGB operated group. Correlation networks were used to identify metabolite association. The metabolic phenotype of this bariatric surgical model inferred systematic change in both myocardial and systemic activity post surgery. The altered metabolic profile following bariatric surgery reflects an enhancement of cardiac energy metabolism through TCA cycle intermediates, cardiorenal protective activity, and biochemical caloric restriction. These surgically induced metabolic shifts identify some of the potential mechanisms that contribute toward bariatric cardioprotection through gut microbiota ecological fluxes and an enterocardiac axis to shield against metabolic syndrome of cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["HutanAshrafian", "Jia VLi", "KonstantinaSpagou", "LeanneHarling", "PerrineMasson", "AraDarzi", "Jeremy KNicholson", "ElaineHolmes", "ThanosAthanasiou"], "doi": "10.1021/pr400748f"}

However, it has other nonimmune functions: in the cardiovascular system, it is a regulator of heart hypertrophy and locally, in coated vascular stents, it inhibits vascular wall cell growth and hence neointimal formation/restenosis. Because the mTOR pathway plays major roles in normal cell growth, metabolism, and survival, we hypothesized that inhibiting it with rapamycin before an acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) would confer cardioprotection by virtue of slowing down cardiac function and metabolism.\nYorkshire pigs received either placebo or 4 mg/d rapamycin orally for 7 days before the IRI.

To investigate these adverse events, an in vitro system was employed to measure their effects on O2 consumption (cellular respiration) by murine myocardium. Specimens were collected from the ventricular myocardium and immediately immersed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer saturated with 95\u00a0% O2:5\u00a0% CO2. O2 concentration was determined as a function of time from the phosphorescence decay rates of Pd(II)-meso-tetra-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-tetrabenzoporphyrin. Myocardial O2 consumption was linear with time (zero-order kinetics); its rate (k, in \u03bcM\u00a0O2\u00a0min(-1)), thus, was the negative of the slope of [O2] vs. time. Cyanide inhibited O2 consumption, confirming the oxidation occurred in the respiratory chain. Lidocaine and bupivacaine produced immediate and sustained inhibition of cellular respiration at plasma concentrations of the drugs (low micromolar range). Bupivacaine was twice as potent as lidocaine. The inhibition was dose-dependent, saturating at concentrations \u226530\u00a0\u03bcM. At saturating doses, lidocaine produced ~20\u00a0% inhibition and bupivacaine ~40\u00a0% inhibition. Cellular ATP was also decreased in the presence of 30\u00a0\u03bcM lidocaine or bupivacaine.

{"title": "Computational methods to reduce uncertainty in the estimation of cardiac conduction properties from electroanatomical recordings.", "abstract": "Cardiac imaging is routinely used to evaluate cardiac tissue properties prior to therapy. By integrating the structural information with electrophysiological data from e.g. electroanatomical mapping systems, knowledge of the properties of the cardiac tissue can be further refined. However, as in other clinical modalities, electrophysiological data are often sparse and noisy, and this results in high levels of uncertainty in the estimated quantities. In this study, we develop a methodology based on Bayesian inference, coupled with a computationally efficient model of electrical propagation to achieve two main aims: (1) to quantify values and associated uncertainty for different tissue conduction properties inferred from electroanatomical data, and (2) to design strategies to optimize the location and number of measurements required to maximize information and reduce uncertainty. The methodology is validated in an in silico study performed using simulated data obtained from a human image-based ventricular model, including realistic fibre orientation and a transmural scar. We demonstrate that the method provides a simultaneous description of clinically-relevant electrophysiological conduction properties and their associated uncertainty for various levels of noise. By using the developed methodology to investigate how the uncertainty decreases in response to added measurements, we then derive an a priori index for placing electrophysiological measurements in order to optimize the information content of the collected data. Results show that the derived index has a clear benefit in minimizing the uncertainty of inferred conduction properties compared to a random distribution of measurements, reducing the number of required measurements by over 50% in several of the investigated settings.

Sesamin (Ses), an active component extracted from sesame seeds, exhibits antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study, possible protective mechanisms of Ses on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity were investigated in rats and cultured H9C2 cells. We demonstrated that Ses exhibits a significant protective effect on cardiac tissue in animal and cell models of DOX-induced cardiac injury. Moreover, Ses can ameliorate DOX-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Further studies suggested that Ses is able to up-regulate the protein expression of Mn-SOD in normal rats and to restore the decreased expression of Mn-SOD in DOX-induced cardiac injury rats. Exposure to Ses or DOX alone slightly increased the protein expression of Sirt1; however, a more remarkable increase in Sirt1 protein level was detected in the Ses+DOX group. Treatment with a pan-sirtuin inhibitor (nicotinamide) or a Sirt1-specific inhibitor (EX-527) partially antagonised the effect of Ses on DOX-induced mitochondrial damage and completely abolished the effect of Ses on Mn-SOD expression. These findings indicate that the protective mechanisms of Ses on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are involved in the alleviation of oxidative stress injury and Mn-SOD dysfunction, partially via the activation of Sirt1.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2013-11-12", "authors": ["SuwenSu", "QianLi", "YiLiu", "ChenXiong", "JunxiaLi", "RongZhang", "YujieNiu", "LijuanZhao", "YongliWang", "HuicaiGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.10.034"}

Microparticles (MPs) mediate cytokine sustained release, and can be utilized to overcome issues related to the limited therapeutic protein stability during systemic administration. We sought to examine whether the administration of microparticles (MPs) containing FGF1 and NRG1 could promote cardiac regeneration in a myocardial infarction (MI) rat model. We investigated the possible underlying mechanisms contributing to the beneficial effects of this therapy, especially those linked to endogenous regeneration. FGF1- and NRG1-loaded MPs were prepared using a multiple emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Seventy-three female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, and MPs were intramyocardially injected in the peri-infarcted zone four days later. Cardiac function, heart tissue remodeling, revascularization, apoptosis, cardiomyocyte proliferation, and stem cell homing were evaluated one week and three months after treatment. MPs were shown to efficiently encapsulate FGF1 and NRG1, releasing the bioactive proteins in a sustained manner. Three months after treatment, a statistically significant improvement in cardiac function was detected in rats treated with growth factor-loaded MPs (FGF1, NRG1, or FGF1/NRG1). The therapy led to inhibition of cardiac remodeling with smaller infarct size, a lower fibrosis degree and induction of tissue revascularization. Cardiomyocyte proliferation and progenitor cell recruitment were detected. Our data support the therapeutic benefit of NRG1 and FGF1 when combined with protein delivery systems for cardiac regeneration.

In the injured heart, however, fibroblasts are activated and differentiate into myofibroblasts that proliferate and generate fibrosis as a component of the wound-healing response. This review discusses how fibroblasts and fibrosis, while essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the heart wall after injury, have undesirable electrophysiological effects by disrupting the normal electrical connectivity of cardiac tissue to increase the vulnerability to arrhythmias. We emphasize the dual contribution of fibrosis in altering source-sink relationships to create a vulnerable substrate while simultaneously facilitating the emergence of triggers such as afterdepolarization-induced premature ventricular complexes-both factors combining synergistically to promote initiation of reentry. We also discuss the potential role of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in directly altering myocyte electrophysiology in a pro-arrhythmic fashion. Insight into these processes may open up novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating arrhythmias in the setting of heart disease as well as avoiding potential arrhythmogenic consequences of cell-based cardiac regeneration therapy.

Here, we have developed a pericardium-derived scaffold that mimics the natural myocardial extracellular environment and investigated its properties for cardiac tissue engineering. Human pericardium membranes (PMs) were decellularized to yield 3D macroporous pericardium scaffolds (PSs) with well-defined architecture and interconnected pores. PSs enabled human Sca-1(+) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) to migrate, survive, proliferate and differentiate at higher rates compared with decellularized pericardium membranes (DPMs) and collagen scaffolds (COLs). Interestingly, histological examination of subcutaneous transplanted scaffolds after one month revealed low immunological response, enhanced angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte differentiation in PSs compared to DPMs and COLs.

Energy starvation is known to exacerbate congestive heart failure, and eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1(Ser51) phosphorylation is increased in the failing heart. However, the effect of GCN2 during the evolution of congestive heart failure has not been tested. In this study, we examined the influence of GCN2 expression in response to a cardiac stress by inducing chronic pressure overload with transverse aortic constriction in wild-type and GCN2 knockout mice. Under basal conditions, GCN2 knockout mice had normal left ventricular structure and function, but after transverse aortic constriction, they demonstrated less contractile dysfunction, less increase in lung weight, less increase in lung inflammation and vascular remodeling, and less myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis compared with wild-type mice, despite an equivalent degree of left ventricular hypertrophy. As expected, GCN2 knockout attenuated transverse aortic constriction-induced cardiac eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1(Ser51) phosphorylation and preserved sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase expression compared with wild-type mice. Interestingly, the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly elevated in GCN2 knockout hearts, whereas in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes, selective knockdown of GCN2 increased Bcl-2 protein expression and enhanced myocyte resistance to an apoptotic stress. Collectively, our data support the notion that GCN2 impairs the ventricular adaptation to chronic pressure overload by reducing Bcl-2 expression and increasing cardiomyocyte susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli.

Four of the mAbs, 2T5C9, 2G9C, T1F11, and TB2H7, demonstrated diagnostic potential in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) by their low to sub-nanomolar cross-reactivity with recombinant wild-type (WT) and mutant TTR aggregates and lack of binding to native TTR or amyloid fibrils formed by other peptides or proteins. Notably, in the presence of normal human sera, three of the four mAbs, 2T5C9, 2G9C, and T1F11, retained low nM binding to TTR amyloid fibrils derived from two patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). The two most promising mAbs, 2T5C9 and 2G9C, were also shown by immunohistochemistry to have low nM binding to TTR amyloid deposits in cardiac tissue sections from two FAP patients.

In this study, we aimed to rapidly, quantitatively, and differentially identify infections by these two parasite species in cultured PBT as well as identify potential host immune responses. Using real-time qPCR, we were successful in quantitatively detecting parasite-specific DNA from within host blood, gill, and heart tissues; positively identifying parasitic infections 44 days earlier than microscopy methods previously employed. Both gill and heart became heavily infected by both parasite species in PBT within two months of sea-cage culture, which was only mitigated by the administration of anthelmintic praziquantel. Nevertheless, fish were observed to mount an organ specific transcriptive immune response during infection that mirrored the relative quantity of pathogenic load. In heart, significant (3-6 fold) increases in IgM, MHC2, TCR\u03b2, and IL-8 transcription was observed in infected fish relative to uninfected controls; whereas in the gills only IgM transcription was observed to be induced (11 fold) by infection. Interestingly, the relative quantity of IgM transcription was highly correlated to the relative abundance of C.\u00a0orientalis but not C.\u00a0opisthorchis DNA in the gill samples, even though this organ showed high prevalence of DNA from both parasite species. Taken together, these findings indicate that although ineffective at combating infection during primary exposure, a cellular immune response is mounted in PBT as a potential rejoinder to future Cardicola exposure, particularly against C.\u00a0orientalis.

HO has recently emerged as a key factor modulating the immune response in diverse models of inflammatory diseases. In mice with two different genetic backgrounds, the pharmacologic inhibition of HO activity with zinc-protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) induced enhanced myocarditis and reduced parasitaemia, which was accompanied by an amplified production of nitric oxide and increased influx of CD4(+), CD8(+) and IFN-\u03b3(+) cells to the myocardium in comparison with the control group. Conversely, treatment with haemin (an activator of HO) lead to a decreased number of intracardiac CD4(+) (but not CD8(+)) cells compared to the control group. The mechanism involved in these observations is a modulation of the induction of regulatory T cells, because the stimulation or inhibition of HO was parallelled by an enhanced or reduced frequency of regulatory T cells, respectively.

{"title": "Proangiogenic microtemplated fibrin scaffolds containing aprotinin promote improved wound healing responses.", "abstract": "Survival of tissue engineered constructs after implantation depends heavily on induction of a vascular response in host tissue, promoting a quick anastomosis of the cellular graft. Additionally, implanted constructs typically induce fibrous capsule formation, effectively preventing graft integration with host tissue. Previously we described the development of a high density microtemplated fibrin scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering applications with tunable degradation and mechanical properties which promoted seeded cell survival and organization in vitro (Thomson et al., Tissue Eng Part A, 2013). Scaffold degradation in vitro was controllable by addition of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and/or the fibrin cross-linker Factor XIII (FXIII). The goal of this study was to assess host tissue responses to these fibrin scaffold formulations by determining effects on scaffold degradation, angiogenic responses, and fibrous capsule formation in a subcutaneous implant model. Aprotinin significantly decreased scaffold degradation over 2\u00a0weeks of implantation. A significant increase in capillary infiltration of aprotinin implants was found after 1 and 2\u00a0weeks, with a significantly greater amount of capillaries reaching the interior of aprotinin scaffolds. Interestingly, after 2\u00a0weeks the aprotinin scaffolds had a significantly thinner, yet apparently more cellular fibrous capsule than unmodified scaffolds.

These included an angiogenic response resulting in increased vascularization of the scaffold material over a relatively short period of time.

{"title": "Biomimetic materials design for cardiac tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. In the absence of sufficient numbers of organs for heart transplant, alternate approaches for healing or replacing diseased heart tissue are under investigation. Designing biomimetic materials to support these approaches will be essential to their overall success. Strategies for cardiac tissue engineering include injection of cells, implantation of three-dimensional tissue constructs or patches, injection of acellular materials, and replacement of valves. To replicate physiological function and facilitate engraftment into native tissue, materials used in these approaches should have properties that mimic those of the natural cardiac environment. Multiple aspects of the cardiac microenvironment have been emulated using biomimetic materials including delivery of bioactive factors, presentation of cell-specific adhesion sites, design of surface topography to guide tissue alignment and dictate cell shape, modulation of mechanical stiffness and electrical conductivity, and fabrication of three-dimensional structures to guide tissue formation and function. Biomaterials can be engineered to assist in stem cell expansion and differentiation, to protect cells during injection and facilitate their retention and survival in vivo, and to provide mechanical support and guidance for engineered tissue formation. Numerous studies have investigated the use of biomimetic materials for cardiac regeneration. Biomimetic material design will continue to exploit advances in nanotechnology to better recreate the cellular environment and advance cardiac regeneration. Overall, biomimetic materials are moving the field of cardiac regenerative medicine forward and promise to deliver new therapies in combating heart disease.", "journal": "Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

{"title": "Cellular mechanisms in intermittent hypoxia-induced cardiac damage in vivo.", "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep, is increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. OSA is associated with changes in the levels of circulating oxidative stress/inflammatory markers and dyslipidemia, supporting their mediating roles in cardiovascular pathogenesis. Our aims were to investigate the effect of IH on heart tissue using an IH-exposed rat model and to explore the potential mechanisms involved in the occurrence of cardiac damage. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to IH and intermittent normoxia as control and sacrificed after 2 or 4 weeks. IH for 4 weeks caused elevation in serum malondialdehyde and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 and reduction in serum adiponectin levels. In contrast, cardiac oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers were suppressed while cardiac adiponectin and cholesterol levels were elevated after IH exposure for 4 weeks. In parallel, there was an increase in apoptosis in the heart of IH-exposed rats, demonstrated by elevations of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein and TUNEL staining. Cardiac damage was further evident with decreased arterial vessel and capillary densities, increased cardiac fibrosis, and the loss of troponin I. Our data demonstrated that IH exposure paradoxically caused systemic oxidative and inflammatory responses and cardioprotective responses, i.e., anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory responses. Despite such a local compensatory protective mechanism, cardiac damage was observed that might be due to IH-induced cholesterol accumulation in the heart and caspase-dependent apoptosis.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2013-10-15", "authors": ["QianHan", "Sze CYeung", "Mary S MIp", "Judith C WMak"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-013-0294-z"}

Perhexiline is a prophylactic anti-anginal drug which is increasingly also used in the treatment of heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We explored the relationship between plasma perhexiline concentrations and its uptake into the myocardium.\nBlood, right atrium \u00b1 left ventricle biopsies were obtained from patients treated with perhexiline for a median of 8.5 days before undergoing coronary surgery in the perhexiline arm of a randomized controlled trial. Perhexiline concentrations in plasma and heart tissue were determined by HPLC.\nAtrial biopsies were obtained from 94 patients and ventricular biopsies from 28 patients. The median plasma perhexiline concentration was within the therapeutic range at 0.24 mg\u2009l\u207b\u00b9 (IQR 0.12-0.44), the median atrial concentration was 6.02 \u2009mg\u2009kg\u207b\u00b9 (IQR 2.70-9.06) and median ventricular concentration was 10.0 mg\u2009kg\u207b\u00b9 (IQR 5.76-13.1). Atrial (r\u00b2 = 0.76) and ventricular (r\u00b2 = 0.73) perhexiline concentrations were closely and directly correlated with plasma concentrations (both P < 0.001). The median atrial\u2009:\u2009plasma ratio was 21.5 (IQR 18.1-27.1), ventricular\u2009:\u2009plasma ratio was 34.9 (IQR 24.5-55.2) and ventricular\u2009:\u2009atrial ratio was 1.67 (IQR 1.39-2.22).

Nevertheless, no link has been so far established between these two processes. Here, we addressed whether cell-to-cell communication processes between MSC and suffering cardiomyocytes and more particularly those involving TNT control the MSC paracrine regenerative function. In the attempt to mimic in vitro an injured heart microenvironment, we developed a species mismatch coculture system consisting of terminally differentiated CM from mouse in a distressed state and human multipotent adipose derived stem cells (hMADS). In this setting, we found that crosstalk between hMADS and CM through TNT altered the secretion by hMADS of cardioprotective soluble factors such as VEGF, HGF, SDF-1\u03b1, and MCP-3 and thereby maximized the capacity of stem cells to promote angiogenesis and chemotaxis of bone marrow multipotent cells. Additionally, engraftment experiments into mouse infarcted hearts revealed that in vitro preconditioning of hMADS with cardiomyocytes increased the cell therapy efficacy of na\u00efve stem cells. In particular, in comparison with hearts treated with stem cells alone, those treated with cocultured ones exhibited greater cardiac function recovery associated with higher angiogenesis and homing of bone marrow progenitor cells at the infarction site.

{"title": "Generation of bioartificial heart tissue by combining a three-dimensional gel-based cardiac construct with decellularized small intestinal submucosa.", "abstract": "The in vitro generation of a bioartificial cardiac construct (CC) represents a promising tool for the repair of ischemic heart tissue. Several approaches to engineer cardiac tissue in vitro have been conducted. The main drawback of these studies is the insufficient size of the resulting construct for clinical applications. The focus of this study was the generation of an artificial three-dimensional (3D), contractile, and suturable myocardial patch by combining a gel-based CC with decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), thereby engineering an artificial tissue of 11\u2009cm\u00b2 in size. The alignment and morphology of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (rCMs) in SIS-CC complexes were investigated as well as the re-organization of primary endothelial cells which were co-isolated in the rCM preparation. The ability of a rat heart endothelial cell line (RHE-A) to re-cellularize pre-existing vessel structures within the SIS or a biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM) was determined. SIS-CC contracted spontaneously, uniformly, and rhythmically with an average rate of 200 beats/min in contrast to undirected contractions observed in CC without SIS support. rCM exhibited an elongated morphology with well-defined sarcomeric structures oriented along the longitudinal axis in the SIS-CC, whereas round-shaped and random-arranged rCM were observed in CC. Electric coupling of rCM was demonstrated by microelectrode array measurements. A dense network of CD31\u207a/eNOS\u207a cells was detected as permeating the whole construct. Superficial supplementation of RHE-A cells to SIS-CC led to the migration of these cells through the CC, resulting in the re-population of pre-existing vessel structures within the decelluarized SIS. By infusion of RHE-A cells into the BioVaM venous and arterial pedicles, a re-population of the BioVaM vessel bed as well as distribution of RHE-A cells throughout the CC was achieved. Rat endothelial cells within the CC were in contact with RHE-A cells.

{"title": "Reduced vesicular storage of catecholamines causes progressive degeneration in the locus ceruleus.", "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disease. Pathologically, PD is characterized by Lewy body deposition and subsequent death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. PD also consistently features degeneration of the locus ceruleus, the main source of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. We have previously reported a mouse model of dopaminergic neurodegeneration based on reduced expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2 LO). To determine if reduced vesicular storage can also cause noradrenergic degeneration, we examined indices of damage to the catecholaminergic systems in brain and cardiac tissue of VMAT2 LO mice. At two months of age, neurochemical analyses revealed substantial reductions in striatal dopamine (94%), cortical dopamine (57%) and norepinephrine (54%), as well as cardiac norepinephrine (97%). These losses were accompanied by increased conversion of dopamine and norepinephrine to their deaminated metabolites. VMAT2 LO mice exhibited loss of noradrenergic innervation in the cortex, as determined by norepinephrine transporter immunoreactivity and (3)H-nisoxetine binding. Using unbiased stereological techniques, we observed progressive degeneration in the locus ceruleus that preceded degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, the ventral tegmental area, which is spared in human PD, remained unaffected. The coordinate loss of dopamine and norepinephrine neurons in VMAT2 LO mice parallels the pattern of neurodegeneration that occurs in human PD, and demonstrates that insufficient catecholamine storage can cause spontaneous degeneration in susceptible neurons, underscoring cytosolic catecholamine catabolism as a determinant of neuronal susceptibility in PD.

The major pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HFPEF are known to be fibrosis and reduced ventricular compliance, and hypertension (HTN) is perhaps the most significant risk factor for the development of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Inflammation is one of the earliest events in cardiac stress situations such as pressure and/or volume overload and involves elevated levels of endothelial adhesion molecules as well as increased production and release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the tissue. The latter promotes the infiltration of activated inflammatory cells, particularly monocytes, into the cardiac tissue. Increased monocyte infiltration is seen in the early and late stages of HTN and HFPEF. Once inside the tissue, monocytes differentiate into macrophages and promote cardiac inflammation, tissue injury, and myocardial fibrosis. This review focuses on inflammation as the initial and primary trigger of ventricular remodelling in HTN and LVDD, affecting progression to HFPEF.

Through the morphological assessment of the differentiated H9c2 cells, we also found that the presence of MNPs significantly increased the fusion index and the surface area of myotubes. In conclusion, the embedding of MNPs is a simple method to tailor the physicochemical properties of the polymeric nanofilms, yet it is an effective approach to enhance the cellular morphogenesis in the field of cardiac tissue engineering for regenerative medicine and biorobotics applications.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

This review emphasizes the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathophysiology of endotoxic shock and the effectiveness of flaxseed in amelioration of the deleterious effects of endotoxic shock on the cardiovascular function and health of the tissue. Endotoxic shock is associated with reduction in the cardiac function measured by cardiac index and left ventricular work index, cardiac contractility measured by dp/dt (rate of change of left ventricular pressure development), dp/dt at CPIP/PAW, where CPIP is common peak isovolumetric pressure and PAW is pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, arterial pressure, and cellular damage measured by increased plasma creatine kinase and elevated plasma lactate. It is also accompanied by increases in the generation of ROS by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and cardiac lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) (cardiac MDA) and reduction in antioxidant reserve and antioxidant enzyme activity. Dimethylthiourea an antioxidant, prevented/reduced the endotoxic shock-induced changes in the cardiac function and contractility, arterial pressure, ROS generated by polymorphonuclear leucocytes; MDA, antioxidant reserve and antioxidant enzyme activity of cardiac tissue, and cellular health. Flaxseed which has antioxidant component ameliorated the endotoxic shock-induced changes in the cardiac function and contractility, arterial pressure, oxidative stress parameters and cellular health.

In the current article we present a novel biosynthetic alginate-poly(propylene fumarate) copolymer based chemically crosslinked hydrogel scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering applications. Partially crosslinked PA hydrogel and fully cross linked PA-A hydrogel scaffolds were prepared. The influence of chemical and physical (morphology and architecture of hydrogel) characteristics on the long term cellular response was studied. Both these hydrogels were cytocompatible and showed no genotoxicity upon contact with fibroblast cells. Both PA and PA-A were able to resist deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species and sustain the viability of L929 cells. The hydrogel incubated oxidative stress induced cells were capable of maintaining the intra cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) expression to the normal level confirmed their protective effect. Relatively the PA hydrogel was found to be unstable in the cell culture medium. The PA-A hydrogel was able to withstand appreciable cyclic stretching. The cyclic stretching introduced complex macro and microarchitectural features with interconnected pores and more structured bound water which would provide long-term viability of around 250% after the 24th day of culture.

{"title": "Material-based engineering strategies for cardiac regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue is composed of muscle and non-muscle cells, surrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM) and spatially organized into a complex three-dimensional (3D) architecture to allow for coordinated contraction and electrical pulse propagation. Despite emerging evidence for cardiomyocyte turnover in mammalian hearts, the regenerative capacity of human cardiac tissue is insufficient to recover from damage, e.g. resulting from myocardial infarction (MI). Instead, the heart 'repairs' lost or injured tissue by ongoing synthesis and remodeling of scar tissue. Conventional therapies and timely (stem) cell delivery to the injured tissue markedly improve short-term function and remodeling, but do not attenuate later stage adverse remodeling, leading to functional deterioration and eventually failure of the heart. Material-based therapies have been successfully used to mechanically support and constrain the post-MI failing heart, preventing it from further remodeling and dilation. When designed to deliver the right microenvironment for endogenous or exogenous cells, as well as the mechanical and topological cues to guide neo-tissue formation, material-based therapies may even reverse remodeling and boost cardiac regeneration. This paper reviews the up-to-date status of material-based cardiac regeneration with special emphasis on 1) the use of bare biomaterials to deliver passive constraints that unload the heart, 2) the use of materials and cells to create engineered cardiac constructs for replacement, support, or regeneration of damaged myocardium, and 3) the development of bio-inspired and bioactive materials that aim to enhance the endogenous regenerative capacity of the heart. As the therapies should function in the infarcted heart, the damaged host environment and engineered in vitro test systems that mimic this environment, are reviewed as well.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2013-07-28", "authors": ["Mieke H vanMarion", "Noortje A MBax", "Ariane C C vanSpreeuwel", "Daisy W Jvan der Schaft", "Carlijn V CBouten"], "doi": "10.2174/13816128113199990582"}

However, their expression and role in cardiac tissue is poorly characterized. Particularly, AQP1 was suggested to transport other molecules (nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) with potential major bearing on cardiovascular physiology. We therefore examined the expression of all AQPs and the phenotype of AQP1 knockout mice (vs. wild-type littermates) under implanted telemetry in vivo, as well as endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated aortas and resistance vessels ex vivo. Four aquaporins were expressed in wild-type heart tissue (AQP1, AQP7, AQP4, AQP8) and two aquaporins in aortic and mesenteric vessels (AQP1-AQP7). AQP1 was expressed in endothelial as well as cardiac and vascular muscle cells and co-segregated with caveolin-1. AQP1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited a prominent microcardia and decreased myocyte transverse dimensions despite no change in capillary density. Both male and female AQP1 KO mice had lower mean BP, which was not attributable to altered water balance or autonomic dysfunction (from baroreflex and frequency analysis of BP and HR variability). NO-dependent BP variability was unperturbed. Accordingly, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDH(F)) or NO-dependent relaxation were unchanged in aorta or resistance vessels ex vivo. However, AQP1 KO mesenteric vessels exhibited an increase in endothelial prostanoids-dependent relaxation, together with increased expression of COX-2. This enhanced relaxation was abrogated by COX inhibition. We conclude that AQP1 does not regulate the endothelial EDH or NO-dependent relaxation ex vivo or in vivo, but its deletion decreases baseline BP together with increased prostanoids-dependent relaxation in resistance vessels. Strikingly, this was associated with microcardia, unrelated to perturbed angiogenesis. This may raise interest for new inhibitors of AQP1 and their use to treat hypertrophic cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["VMontiel", "ELeon Gomez", "CBouzin", "HEsfahani", "MRomero Perez", "ILobysheva", "ODevuyst", "CDessy", "J LBalligand"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-013-1325-x"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study.

In teleost fishes, details of the organization of this system are not well understood. Here we investigated innervation patterns in the heart of the goldfish, a species representative of a large group of cyprinids. We used antibodies against the neuronal markers zn-12, acetylated tubulin, and human neuronal protein C/D, as well as choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, nitric oxide synthetase, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) to detect neural elements and their transmitter contents in wholemounts and sections of cardiac tissue. All chambers of the heart were innervated by choline acetyltransferase-positive axons, implying cholinergic regulation; and by tyrosine hydroxylase-containing axons, implying adrenergic regulation. The mean total number of intracardiac neurons was 713 \u00b1 78 (SE), nearly half of which were cholinergic. Neuronal somata were mainly located in a ganglionated plexus around the sinoatrial valves. Somata were contacted by cholinergic, adrenergic, nitrergic, and VIP-positive terminals. Putative pacemaker cells, identified by immunoreactivity for hyperpolarization activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4, were located in the base of the sinoatrial valves, and this region was densely innervated by cholinergic and adrenergic terminals.

{"title": "Potentiating the naturally occurring process for repair of damaged heart.", "abstract": "This article reviews the current progresses in application of both exogenous and endogenous progenitor cells/stem cells for cardiac repair, and the current understanding of the naturally-occurring process for physiological myocyte turnover and possibly cardiac repair. In particular the development of methods for potentiating the naturally-occurring mechanism for substantial repair of pathologically damaged cardiac tissues is discussed. In the last decade, tremendous efforts to identify both exogenous and endogenous progenitor cells/stem cells possessing capacities of differentiating into cardiac lineages have been made for potential cardiac repair. Although many impressive progresses have been made in the application of differently sourced progenitor cells/stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS), bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skeletal myoblasts (SMs), umbilical cord blood cells (UCBs), residential cardiac stem cells (CSCs), cardiac resident fibroblasts (CRFs), or adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) for repair of damaged heart, however, inevitable controversies exist concerning: (i) the immune compatibility of the exogenous donor progenitors/stem cells, (ii) the tumorigenicity with ESCs and iPS, and (iii) the efficiency of these exogenous or endogenous progenitors/ stem cells to acquire cardiac lineages to reconstitute the lost cardiac tissues. The recent recognition of some active small molecules that can induce myocardial regeneration to repair damaged heart tissues through enhancing the naturally-occurring cardiac-repair mechanism has offered the hope for clinical translation of the technology. Potentiating the naturally-occurring process for cardiac repair by administration of such small molecules has provided a promising strategy for reconstruction of damaged cardiac tissues after heart infarction. Therefore, this article is in favor of the notion that such small molecules with the activity of manipulating gene expressions in such a way of inducing endogenous stem cells to commit cardiac lineage differentiation and consequently myocardial regeneration may fulfill the dream of substantial repair of damaged heart.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2013-07-13", "authors": ["MingLi", "Shi ChungNg"], "doi": "10.2174/13816128113199990447"}

Moreover, this research has resulted in the identification of the adipocyte as an endocrine organ producing potent bioactive compounds. An increasing number of these adipokines are being identified, the first of which was leptin, a product of the obesity gene whose primary function is to act as a satiety factor but which is now known to exert a myriad of effects. It is now recognized that virtually all adipokines produce effects on numerous organ systems including the heart and many of these, including leptin, are produced by cardiac tissue. Here we focus primarily on the diverse effects of leptin on the heart especially as it pertains to hypertrophy and discuss the potential cell signaling mechanisms underlying their actions. Current evidence suggests that leptin is a cardiac hypertrophic factor and from clinical studies there is evidence that hyperleptinemia is associated with cardiovascular risk especially as it pertains to heart failure.

{"title": "Na/K pump regulation of cardiac repolarization: insights from a systems biology approach.", "abstract": "The sodium-potassium pump is widely recognized as the principal mechanism for active ion transport across the cellular membrane of cardiac tissue, being responsible for the creation and maintenance of the transarcolemmal sodium and potassium gradients, crucial for cardiac cell electrophysiology. Importantly, sodium-potassium pump activity is impaired in a number of major diseased conditions, including ischemia and heart failure. However, its subtle ways of action on cardiac electrophysiology, both directly through its electrogenic nature and indirectly via the regulation of cell homeostasis, make it hard to predict the electrophysiological consequences of reduced sodium-potassium pump activity in cardiac repolarization. In this review, we discuss how recent studies adopting the systems biology approach, through the integration of experimental and modeling methodologies, have identified the sodium-potassium pump as one of the most important ionic mechanisms in regulating key properties of cardiac repolarization and its rate dependence, from subcellular to whole organ levels. These include the role of the pump in the biphasic modulation of cellular repolarization and refractoriness, the rate control of intracellular sodium and calcium dynamics and therefore of the adaptation of repolarization to changes in heart rate, as well as its importance in regulating pro-arrhythmic substrates through modulation of dispersion of repolarization and restitution. Theoretical findings are consistent across a variety of cell types and species including human, and widely in agreement with experimental findings.

We previously reported that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gaseous mediator, regulates renin synthesis and release in juxtaglomerular cells. The present study was designed to investigate whether H2S can protect against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced heart failure via inhibition of local renin activity in rat hearts.\nIn the present study, we found that an injection of ISO (150\u2009mg/kg) significantly increased plasma lactate dehydrogenase level and hypertrophy index and impaired LV end diastolic pressure. Treatment with NaHS (an H2S donor, 0.056\u2009mg/kg, daily) 3 days before and 2 weeks after the ISO injection attenuated the development of heart failure. Histological staining showed that NaHS decreased ISO-induced collagen deposition. Moreover, NaHS treatment reversed ISO-induced renin elevation in both plasma and LVs. Immunostaining analysis indicated that renin expression co-localized with mast cells in the ventricular tissues. Mast cell counts showed that NaHS treatment decreased the number of degranulated mast cells in cardiac tissue due to down-regulation of leukotriene A4 hydrolase protein expression and leukotriene B4 level. In addition, NaHS treatment also inhibited forskolin-induced renin degranulation from HMC-1.1 mast cells by lowering intracellular cAMP level.\nThis study provides evidence for a new pathway in H2S-induced cardioprotection against heart failure development.\nFor the first time, we demonstrated that H2S might protect heart during heart failure by suppression of local renin level through inhibition of both mast cell infiltration and renin degranulation.", "journal": "Antioxidants & redox signaling", "date": "2013-04-16", "authors": ["Yi-HongLiu", "MingLu", "Zhi-ZhongXie", "FeiHua", "LiXie", "Jun HongGao", "Yung-HuaKoh", "Jin-SongBian"], "doi": "10.1089/ars.2012.4888"}
