{"title": "The role of printing parameters and scaffold biopolymer properties in the efficacy of a new hybrid nano-bioprinting system.", "abstract": "We created a hybrid nano-bioprinting system, which combines the initial patterning capabilities of direct cell writing with the active patterning capabilities of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Biofabrication conditions, including printing parameters and scaffold biopolymer properties, may affect cell viability, nanoparticle manipulation and patterning capabilities. Nanoparticles were printed under varied conditions either in the biopolymer or loaded inside cells. Cell viability, alginate viscosity, nanoparticle movement and printing resolution were measured. We now show that while nanoparticles decreased cell viability, nozzle size had no significant effect. High printing pressure decreased cell viability, but viability loss was not accentuated by nanoparticles. High nanoparticle concentrations increased alginate viscosity at higher alginate concentrations. Nanoparticle velocity in response to a magnetic field was a function of nanoparticle diameter and scaffold viscosity, which agreed with a mathematical model of nanoparticle movement. Finally, the nano-bioprinting system resolution and patterning precision were not affected by nanoparticles in the prepolymer solution. These data suggest that nanoparticle incorporation in solid freeform fabrication does not change biofabrication parameters unless high nanoparticle concentrations are used.

{"title": "Marine Natural Products as Inhibitors of Hypoxic Signaling in Tumors.", "abstract": "Marine natural products have become a major source of new chemical entities in the discovery of potential anticancer agents that potently suppress various antitumor molecular targets. As a consequence of insufficient vascularization, hypoxic regions form within rapidly growing solid tumor masses. Specific alterations of gene expression in these hypoxic tumor cells help facilitate the survival and metastatic spread of solid tumors. The transcriptional response to cellular hypoxia is primarily mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) that regulates the expression of more than 100 genes involved in cellular adaptation and survival under hypoxic stress. Clinical studies in cancer patients indicate that HIF-1 activation is directly correlated with advanced disease stages and treatment resistance. HIF-1 has emerged as an important tumor-selective molecular target for anticancer drug discovery. As a result, natural product-based inhibitors of HIF-1 activation have been identified from plants and microorganisms. Recently, structurally unique natural products from marine sponges, crinoids, and algae have been identified as HIF-1 activation inhibitors. The US National Cancer Institute's Open Repository of marine invertebrate and algae extracts has proven to be a valuable source of natural product HIF-1 inhibitors. Among the active compounds identified, certain marine natural products have also been shown to suppress the hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Some of these marine HIF-1 inhibitors act by interfering with the generation of mitochondrial signaling molecules in hypoxic cells. However, the precise mechanisms of action for many newly identified marine natural product HIF-1 inhibitors remain unresolved.", "journal": "Phytochemistry reviews : proceedings of the Phytochemical Society of Europe", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["Dale GNagle", "Yu-DongZhou"], "doi": "10.1007/s11101-009-9120-1\n10.1021/np800342s"}

In vitro studies of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), an aggressive malignancy that is nearly always infected by Epstein-Barr virus, show HIF-1alpha is upregulated by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). The current study used immunohistochemistry to examine the extent to which HIF-1alpha and LMP1 are co-expressed in naturally infected NPC tissues. Analytic procedures were optimized for sensitive localization of HIF-1alpha and LMP1 in fixed tissue sections using immunohistochemistry with sensitive fluorescent and signal amplification technologies. Vessel density was quantified by CD31 immunohistochemistry. LMP1 was expressed focally in all 18 NPCs examined, including 7/8 in situ lesions. There was no consistent co-localization with HIF-1alpha which was usually only weakly expressed in a subset of neoplastic cells. Neither LMP1 nor HIF-1alpha expression correlated with vessel density, and degree of vascularization varied widely among cases. Advanced immunohistochemical technologies reveal that LMP1 is expressed more commonly than previously reported in NPC. There is no consistent relationship between LMP1 and either HIF-1alpha expression or degree of microvasculature.

At surgery, a thyroid lobectomy and a parathyroidectomy were performed. The parathyroid tissue showed a very well defined zellballen arrangement of paraganglion cells within the parenchyma of the parathyroid gland. The cells had ample basophilic, granular cytoplasm. The nuclei were generally round to oval with 'salt-and-pepper' nuclear chromatin distribution. There was a richly vascularized stroma. Mitotic figures, necrosis, invasive growth, and profound nuclear pleomorphism were absent. The neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely immunoreactive with chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, and focally with cyclin-D1.

{"title": "[Ultrasonography-guided therapeutic procedures in the neck region].", "abstract": "Minimally invasive therapeutic procedures in medicine have become very popular because of the reduced risk compared to classic surgical treatment, speed of recovery, little or no side effects, and frequently lower cost. One of these methods is ultrasonography-guided percutaneous injection of 95% ethanol (PEIT, percutaneous ethanol injection therapy), which is especially suitable for the neck region. Other methods like laser photocoagulation (ILP) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are more aggressive and expensive.\nThe procedure of sterile 95% ethanol injecting is performed on an outpatient basis, without preparation. A specific amount of alcohol is injected into the lesion using a thin spinal needle, under ultrasonography guidance. The amount of alcohol depends on the size of the lesion. Complications are rare and the procedure can be repeated several times. PEIT is used in the treatment of parathyroid glands, especially secondary hyperparathyroidism, thyroid nodules (toxic adenoma, goiters and cysts), other cysts on the neck, and cervical metastases of thyroid cancer.\nDirect ethanol injection into the tissue causes cellular dehydration and protein denaturation, followed by the development of necrosis, fibrosis, and thrombosis of the small blood vessels. In this way, reduction or disappearance of the nodes can be achieved, along with functional normalization (for parathyroid glands and toxic adenoma), with longer or shorter disease remission or complete recovery. Today, PEIT is mostly used in dialyzed patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The treatment gives best results in combination with vitamin D analogs, if 1-2 parathyroid glands are enlarged, and for residual parathyroid gland after parathyroidectomy. A success rate of 50%-70% has been reported, depending on the number of enlarged parathyroid glands. Therapeutic effect is manifested in the size reduction or complete fibrozation of the gland, reduction or disappearance of vascularization, and a decrease in the parathormone level. PEIT produced best results in cysts (thyroid cysts, parathyroid cysts or other cysts on the neck), and can replace surgery. In most cases, results are achieved after the first injection. Volume reduction is between 50% and 95%, depending on the size and content of the cyst (clear, colloidal, or hemorrhagic) and presence of solid tissue. Therapy for toxic and autonomous thyroid adenoma and toxic nodular goiter by ethanol injection is accepted as one of the methods for treating patients that refuse radiation therapy or surgery. The goals of the treatment are nodal size reduction, normalization of thyroid hormones and TSH, and an improved subjective condition of the patient. Complete cure has been achieved in more than 75% of patients. Post-therapeutic development of hypothyroidism is extremely rare. The treatment can also be used for non-toxic goiter, especially those with cystic changes. PEIT is also recommended for the treatment of thyroid cancer neck metastases as an alternative procedure in patients at a high risk of reoperation, those that refuse surgery, and those with radioiodine-negative metastasis. The results of PEIT show significant reduction in nodal size or complete disappearance of the node in more than 70% of patients, with a decrease in serum thyroglobulin, except for patients with distant metastases. The procedure can be repeated until the desired effect is achieved, and is well tolerated by patients.\nTherapeutic procedures under ultrasonography guidance are becoming ever more important in medical protocols. In the head and neck region, PEIT is the most widely used method because of a number of advantages. The simplicity of the procedure, relatively few side effects, low cost, outpatient treatment and good results make this method preferable to other, invasive therapeutic procedures.", "journal": "Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti", "date": "2010-03-18", "authors": ["Hrvojka Tomi\u0107Brzac"], "doi": null}

While aspects of the rate of generation of NO in tumors have been extensively studied, the rate of its removal from tumors has not been considered, even though it is the difference between the two rates that determines the all important steady-state NO concentration, and thus the likelihood of apoptosis-triggering. The rate of transport of NO scales with its concentration gradient at the interface between a neoplasm and the phase to which it diffuses, which can be air, fat, or blood. Diffusional loss of NO to air would explain the initial two-dimensionality of neoplasms of the skin and lung. The greater solubility of NO in lipids than in aqueous phases should cause its extraction by nearby fat, and would account for the positive correlation between obesity and the incidence of some cancers, such as cancers of the breast. And the rapid consumption of NO by red blood cells implies depletion of excess NO in tumors after they are vascularized: angiogenesis should blunt any apoptosis-triggering NO attack of the immune system. Thus, cancer research and the practice of oncology may benefit of in-tumor monitoring of the actual NO concentration.

{"title": "From the discovery of the circulation of the blood to the first steps in hemorheology: part 1.", "abstract": "In this article (the first of two on the subject) a brief historical review is presented of the prevailing ideas on the nature of the blood and its circulation from antiquity to the 16th century, when the problem was solved by William Harvey. On the basis of vivisection of various types of animals, Harvey constructed a general and logical model for the whole systemic circulation, which contradicted previous concepts, mainly those that had been put forward by Galen fourteen centuries before. The influence that Galen still exercised on virtually all areas of medicine justified Harvey's hesitations and scruples, forcing him to delay publishing his conclusions for thirteen years. It also explains the controversy with fellow physicians on the subject, which continued until his death. However, through careful observation and painstaking investigation, Harvey demonstrated clearly that the heart was the central organ of the circulatory system, on which depended the propulsion of the blood to the arteries and its subsequent return by different vessels, the veins, to its starting point. The blood coming from the heart was different from that which returned to the organ, the difference (in color and fluidity) being attributed to the presence of constituents which nourished the organism it irrigated. Harvey characterized blood pulsation as the result of the arteries filling with arterial blood during each heart contraction. He demonstrated that the arterial blood left the heart by contraction of the left ventricle, which happened simultaneously with contraction of the right ventricle and, in both, after the contraction of the atria. He confirmed that blood passed through the lung circulation from the right ventricle to the left atrium and from there to the left ventricle. By calculating the volume of blood pumped daily by the heart, Harvey reasoned that the blood could not be consumed by the body and would have to circulate continually through the heart and vascular network. Although Harvey did not confirm the continuity of the circulatory network, he went so far as to hypothesize the existence of minuscule imperceptible passages between arteries and veins, which was later confirmed by Marcello Malpighi, in the form of networks of capillaries. The one-way direction of blood flow was ensured by valves in the heart and veins. The model established by Harvey for blood circulation in animals and extrapolated to humans was confirmed in the following centuries. Malpighi and van Leeuwenhoek, in particular, helped clarify the composition and characteristics of blood and their importance for its perfusion of the different vessels of the circulatory network.", "journal": "Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology", "date": "2010-03-13", "authors": ["JMartins e Silva"], "doi": null}

The aim of the present study is to assess the benefit of endoluminal ultrasonography with Doppler evaluation for rectal cancer restaging after preoperative radiotherapy.\nTwenty six patients (10 female, 16 males, mean age--58 years) with histologically proven rectal cancer underwent preoperative radiotherapy. All patients were examined by endoluminal (endorectal or endovaginal) ultrasonography. Endosonography was repeated on 13 patients after small fractions preoperative radiotherapy.\nThe mean transversal diameter of lesions before preoperative radiotherapy established by endoluminal ultrasonography is 33mm +/- 11 mm. After preoperative radiotherapy we detect significant reduction of 33% in the transversal tumor size--mean 23mm +/- 7mm (p < 0.001). After radiation the mean distance from the tumor to the internal anal sphincter increases without statistical significance by 5%: from 59 +/- 18 mm to 62 +/- 16 mm (p = 0.165). Compared to histological data, endosonographic restaging after radiotherapy is accurate in 9/13 (69%) for T parameter and 11/13 (85%) for N. After preoperative radiotherapy tumor sonographic structure is hyperechoic (homogeneous or inhomogeneous)--in 9 patients and only in 4 cases the tumor remains hypoechoic. Power Doppler exam before radiotherapy shows poor vascularization in 5 tumors--(19%). Abundant vascularization is found in 9 cases--(35%). In the remaining 12 patients tumor vascularization is considered as moderate. In 8 out of 13 cases (61.5%) after radiotherapy, vascular signals are less expressed. Lack of vascular alterations on pulse color and power Doppler flow is detected in the remaining 5 patients. No patients have more expressed vascularization on power Doppler examination after radiotherapy.\nAccording to our results the accuracy of endosonographic restaging after radiotherapy is lower for assessment of T criterion and is better for N parameter.

The recent increase in the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the dearth of anti-TB drugs is threatening the future containment of TB. New drugs or delivery systems that will stop the spread of TB and slow down or prevent the development of drug-resistant strains are urgently required. One of the reasons for the emergence of drug-resistant strains is the exposure of mycobacteria to sub-therapeutic levels of one or more antibiotics. Lung lesions containing large numbers of bacteria are poorly vascularized and are fortified with thick fibrous tissue; conventional therapy by the oral and parenteral routes may provide sub-therapeutic levels of anti-TB drugs to these highly sequestered organisms. Administering drugs by the pulmonary route to the lungs allows higher drug concentrations in the vicinity of these lesions. Supplementing conventional therapy with inhaled anti-TB therapy may allow therapeutic concentrations of drug to penetrate effectively into lung lesions and treat the resident mycobacteria.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical research", "date": "2010-02-26", "authors": ["PavanMuttil", "ChenchenWang", "Anthony JHickey"], "doi": "10.1007/s11095-009-9957-4"}

There is now clear evidence that post-natal, pathological tissue neo-vascularization is crucial for cancer growth and therapy as well. Integrins are major ECM receptors that can exist in different functional states with respect to their affinity for ECM proteins. Regulation of integrin activation is crucial for their biological functions. In the embryo, the development of a properly patterned network of blood vessels relies upon the fine modulation of integrin activation by chemoattractant and chemorepulsive cues, such as angiogenic growth factors and semaphorins. Such a fine-tuning of endothelial integrin function is likely to be disrupted in cancer. Here, the vasculature is structurally and functionally abnormal and therefore inadequate for an efficient drug and oxygen delivery, which is a mandatory pre-requisite for successful chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It is thus important to identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate integrin function in normal ECs and which are altered in tumor ECs.", "journal": "European cytokine network", "date": "2010-02-20", "authors": ["FedericoBussolino", "FrancescaCaccavari", "DonatellaValdembri", "GuidoSerini"], "doi": "10.1684/ecn.2009.0168"}

With these issues in mind, we have undertaken the attempt to optimize the procedure of mixed chimerism induction in mice. In order to reduce toxicity, we used decreasing doses of total body irradiation (TBI) together with combination of blocking antibodies. We also tried to eliminate immunosuppression (cyclophosphamide - CP) treatment after bone marrow transplantation. B6.SJL-PtprcaPep3b mice were injected with 20-30 x 106 bone marrow cells from Balb C mice. Mice were treated with TBI (3 - 1.5 - 0 Gy) on \"-1\" day of the experiment and blocking antibodies against CD40L (\"0\", and \"4\" days) and additionally anti-CD8 (\"-2\" day) and/or anti-NK1.1 (\"-3\" day). Mice in certain groups also received CP (175 mg/kg) on \"2\" day. Presence of mixed chimerism was assessed in peripheral blood cells by flow cytometry on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th weeks of the experiment by detecting of CD45.1 (characteristic for B6.SJL-PtprcaPep3b strain) and CD45.2 (characteristic for Balb C strain) antigens expression. We also analyzed the percentage of peripheral blood CD8 T-cells (CD3e/CD8a) and NK cells (Ly-49D/NK1.1). We found that reduction of TBI dose and elimination of CP decrease the rate of mixed chimerism formation. The highest percentage of donor cells was obtained in the group of animals treated with 3 Gy of TBI, CP and combination of anti-CD40L, anti-CD8, and anti-NK1.1 antibodies. The 3 Gy TBI was necessary to induce stable mixed chimerism, but it could be obtained without the CP use. The percentage of CD3e/CD8a and Ly-49D/NK1.1 cells was significantly lower in the groups of mice treated by corresponding antibodies. Moreover, we observed the lowest number of peripheral blood Ly-49D/NK1.1 cells in the group of animals with highest mixed chimerism. Our experiments in mice model can help in better understanding of mixed chimerism phenomenon and in selecting the method of mixed chimerism induction with lowest possible toxicity.

Determining drug delivery to brain tumors is a challenging problem, and the noninvasive detection of drug directly in the tumor can be critically important for accessing, predicting, and eventually improving effectiveness of therapy. In this study, in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to detect an anticancer agent, temozolomide (TMZ), in vivo in murine xenotransplants of U87MG human brain cancer. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the low-molecular-weight contrast agent, gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (GdDTPA), was used to evaluate tumor vascular parameters. Carbon-13-labeled TMZ ([(13)C]TMZ, 99%) was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of approximately 140 mg/kg (450 mg/m(2), well within the maximal clinical dose of 1000 mg/m(2) used in humans) during the course of in vivo MRS experiments. Heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) MRS of brain tumors was performed before and after i.p. administration of [(13)C]TMZ. Dynamic MRI experiments demonstrated slower recovery of MRI signal following an intravenous bolus injection of GdDTPA, higher vascular flow and volume obtained by T*(2)-weighted MRI, as well as enhanced uptake of the contrast agent in the brain tumor compared with normal brain detected by T(1)-weighted MRI. These data demonstrate partial breakdown of the BBB/BTB and good vascularization in U87MG xenografts. A [(13)C]TMZ peak was detected at 3.9 ppm by HMQC from a selected volume of about 0.15 cm(3) within the brain tumor with HMQC pulse sequences. This study clearly demonstrates the noninvasive detection of [(13)C]TMZ in xenografted U87MG brain tumors with MRS.

He developed corneal edema with decrease in vision in his left eye following application of the plant extract. Treatment with topical steroids and antibiotics resulted in a complete clinical and visual recovery. The second patient developed a fungal corneal ulcer (dermatophyte - Trichophyton mentagrophyte) after sustaining injury with an animal tail to the right eye and used honey for pain relief prior to presentation. She responded poorly to anti-fungal treatment, underwent a penetrating keratoplasty with recurrence of infection in the graft that resulted in a vascularized corneal scar. The third patient was a five-year-old child who was treated with 'wasam' on the occiput for intraocular inflammation following bilateral uncomplicated cataract extraction.

Four patients had undergone surgery previously: two had initial pinning of the acute AC joint separation, and two had a subsequent Mumford procedure. The surgical technique, performed entirely by arthroscopy, consisted of (1) rerouting the coracoacromial ligament with a bone block harvested from the tip of the acromion in a socket created in the distal clavicle (Chuinard's modification of the Weaver-Dunn procedure) and (2) augmenting the reconstruction with 2 titanium buttons connected by a heavy suture in a 4-strand configuration (Double-Button fixation; Smith & Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA). Patients were prospectively followed up for a mean of 12.8 months (range, 6 to 20 months).\nOne patient had a superficial infection of the superior (clavicular) portal, which resolved with oral antibiotics.

All symptoms resolved (pain, shoulder weakness, paresthesia).

We selected two high-affinity and highly specific EphA2 monoclonal antibodies with different in vitro properties on the human pancreatic tumor cell line MiaPaCa2. One is a potent EphA2-agonistic antibody, IgG25, that promotes receptor endocytosis and subsequent degradation, and the second is a ligand antagonist, IgG28, that blocks the binding to ephrin A1 and is cross-reactive with the mouse EphA2 receptor. We measured the effect of antibody treatment on the growth of MiaPaCa2 cells orthotopically transplanted in nude mice. Both IgG25 and IgG28 had strong antitumor and antimetastatic efficacy. In vivo treatment with IgG25 determined the reduction of the EphA2 protein levels in the tumor and the phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr576 while administration of IgG28 caused a decrease in tumor vascularization as measured by immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 in tumor sections.

{"title": "Bioartificial matrices for therapeutic vascularization.", "abstract": "Therapeutic vascularization remains a significant challenge in regenerative medicine applications. Whether the goal is to induce vascular growth in ischemic tissue or scale up tissue-engineered constructs, the ability to induce the growth of patent, stable vasculature is a critical obstacle. We engineered polyethylene glycol-based bioartificial hydrogel matrices presenting protease-degradable sites, cell-adhesion motifs, and growth factors to induce the growth of vasculature in vivo. Compared to injection of soluble VEGF, these matrices delivered sustained in vivo levels of VEGF over 2 weeks as the matrix degraded. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, degradable constructs containing VEGF and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide induced a significant number of vessels to grow into the implant at 2 weeks with increasing vessel density at 4 weeks. The mechanism of enhanced vascularization is likely cell-demanded release of VEGF, as the hydrogels may degrade substantially within 2 weeks. In a mouse model of hind-limb ischemia, delivery of these matrices resulted in significantly increased rate of reperfusion.

{"title": "HOXB9, a gene overexpressed in breast cancer, promotes tumorigenicity and lung metastasis.", "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying tumoral secretion of signaling molecules into the microenvironment, which modulates tumor cell fate, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, are not well understood. Aberrant expression of transcription factors, which has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of several types of cancers, may provide a mechanism that induces the expression of growth and angiogenic factors in tumors, leading to their local increase in the tumor microenvironment, favoring tumor progression. In this report, we demonstrate that the transcription factor HOXB9 is overexpressed in breast carcinoma, where elevated expression correlates with high tumor grade. HOXB9 induces the expression of several angiogenic factors (VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, and ANGPTL-2), as well as ErbB (amphiregulin, epiregulin, and neuregulins) and TGF-ss, which activate their respective pathways, leading to increased cell motility and acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes. In vivo, HOXB9 promotes the formation of large, well-vascularized tumors that metastasize to the lung. Thus, deregulated expression of HOXB9 contributes to breast cancer progression and lung metastasis by inducing several growth factors that alter tumor-specific cell fates and the tumor stromal microenvironment.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2010-01-19", "authors": ["TetsuHayashida", "FumiyukiTakahashi", "NaokazuChiba", "ElenaBrachtel", "MotomiTakahashi", "NadiaGodin-Heymann", "Kenneth WGross", "Maria d MVivanco", "VasukiWijendran", "ToshihiroShioda", "DennisSgroi", "Patricia KDonahoe", "ShyamalaMaheswaran"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0912710107"}

{"title": "Transplantation of MSCs in combination with netrin-1 improves neoangiogenesis in a rat model of hind limb ischemia.", "abstract": "Similar to the neural network, the vascular network is formed from central axial structures that send sprouts along predetermined trajectories to their distal destinations. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that neuronal guidance factors and their receptors function as angiogenic regulators. As neural guidance cues, netrin-1 is the most extensively studied gene in the field of angiogenesis. Despite achieving some advances in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in angiogenesis, there are still a certain number of patients who fail to respond to cell therapy. Thus, a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the angiogenic property of transplanted cells is desirable. This study examined the impact of combined netrin-1 protein and MSC implantation on therapeutic angiogenesis in a rat model of hind limb ischemia.\nHind limb ischemic rats (n = 24) were divided randomly into four groups (six rats per group): control group (0.05 mL saline); netrin-1 group (1 \u03bcg netrin-1 dissolved in 0.05 mL saline); MSC group (1 \u00d7 10(6) MSCs); and netrin-1/MSCs group (1 \u03bcg netrin-1 combined with MSCs). Netrin-1 and/or MSCs were injected directly into the muscle of the ischemic limb. Gross appearance of ischemic limb, collateral vessel formation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level were assessed 28 d after treatment.\nThe results showed that pretreatment of MSCs with a recombinant netrin-1 protein markedly augmented the angiographic score and capillary density, improved function of the ischemic limb, and increased levels of VEGF in the plasma and damaged tissues. Further studies assaying the cell migration and network formation suggested that netrin-1 promoted MSC migration and enhanced its ability to participate in tube formation.\nThese results demonstrated that transplantation of MSCs pretreated with netrin-1 protein significantly improved the therapeutic effect of MSCs and, therefore, may provide a novel therapeutic approach for ischemic disease.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2010-01-15", "authors": ["QianLi", "DanYao", "JianhuaMa", "JianZhu", "XianghongXu", "YunliRen", "XinshengDing", "XiaomingMao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2009.08.031"}

An association between ING1 and angiogenesis has not been reported yet. Our previous studies using tumor samples from patients have shown that ING1 levels are downregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most highly vascularized malignancies. Based on this background, the goal of this study was to test the effects of the major ING1 splicing isoforms, p47ING1a and p33ING1b, on pathological angiogenesis induced by human GBM cells. We used a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay to examine whether LN229 human GBM cells can induce angiogenesis and whether alterations in ING1 expression, such as ING1 knockdown by siRNA or ectopic ING1 overexpression using ING1a and ING1b expression constructs, can affect this process. Increased ING1 protein expression significantly suppressed LN229 cell-induced angiogenesis in the CAM assay. While no effects on the proangiogenic factors VEGF or IL-8 were noted, the expression of angiopoietins (Ang) 1 and 4 were increased by the p47ING1a, but not by the p33ING1b isoform. Levels of Ang-2 were not sensitive to altered ING1 levels. Our data are the first to suggest that ING1 proteins suppress neoangiogenesis in GBM.

{"title": "The multifunctional choroid.", "abstract": "The choroid of the eye is primarily a vascular structure supplying the outer retina. It has several unusual features: It contains large membrane-lined lacunae, which, at least in birds, function as part of the lymphatic drainage of the eye and which can change their volume dramatically, thereby changing the thickness of the choroid as much as four-fold over a few days (much less in primates). It contains non-vascular smooth muscle cells, especially behind the fovea, the contraction of which may thin the choroid, thereby opposing the thickening caused by expansion of the lacunae. It has intrinsic choroidal neurons, also mostly behind the central retina, which may control these muscles and may modulate choroidal blood flow as well. These neurons receive sympathetic, parasympathetic and nitrergic innervation. The choroid has several functions: Its vasculature is the major supply for the outer retina; impairment of the flow of oxygen from choroid to retina may cause Age-Related Macular Degeneration. The choroidal blood flow, which is as great as in any other organ, may also cool and warm the retina. In addition to its vascular functions, the choroid contains secretory cells, probably involved in modulation of vascularization and in growth of the sclera. Finally, the dramatic changes in choroidal thickness move the retina forward and back, bringing the photoreceptors into the plane of focus, a function demonstrated by the thinning of the choroid that occurs when the focal plane is moved back by the wearing of negative lenses, and, conversely, by the thickening that occurs when positive lenses are worn. In addition to focusing the eye, more slowly than accommodation and more quickly than emmetropization, we argue that the choroidal thickness changes also are correlated with changes in the growth of the sclera, and hence of the eye. Because transient increases in choroidal thickness are followed by a prolonged decrease in synthesis of extracellular matrix molecules and a slowing of ocular elongation, and attempts to decouple the choroidal and scleral changes have largely failed, it seems that the thickening of the choroid may be mechanistically linked to the scleral synthesis of macromolecules, and thus may play an important role in the homeostatic control of eye growth, and, consequently, in the etiology of myopia and hyperopia.", "journal": "Progress in retinal and eye research", "date": "2010-01-02", "authors": ["Debora LNickla", "JoshWallman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.preteyeres.2009.12.002"}

A review of the literature on this subject was carried out and Dutch head and neck cancer centres were asked to share their guidelines concerning the prevention of thrombosis after free vascularized graft surgery. No consensus in the literature was found on how thrombosis could best be prevented. The Dutch Head and Neck Cancer Centers use routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent thrombosis in the anastomosis. It was also concluded that non-pharmacologic measures for preventing thrombosis, such as meticulous microvascular surgery and smoking cessation prior to the operation, are thought to play an important role in the prevention of thrombosis in microvascular free-flap reconstructions. It has not been determined which pre- and postoperative pharmacologic measure can prevent thrombosis most effectively. A pharmacologic regimen to prevent thrombosis that is customized to the patient is suggested. This should be based on an individual risk profile for the development of thrombosis.", "journal": "International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["M TBrands", "S Cvan den Bosch", "F JDieleman", "S JBerg\u00e9", "M A WMerkx"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2009.11.020"}
{"title": "The expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in ovarian follicles throughout the estrous cycle in the ewe.", "abstract": "Healthy follicles are highly vascularized whereas those undergoing atresia have poor vascularity, suggesting a relationship between follicular vascularization and follicular function. Vascularization is regulated by angiogenic factors, and among them vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-Tie (Ang-Tie) systems are of central importance. The objectives of this study were to determine if VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and components of the Ang-Tie system are expressed in ovarian follicles at both the protein and mRNA levels and to explore if their expression is related to the stage of the estrous cycle in the ewe. Ovaries from cyclic ewes were collected during the luteal phase (n=5) or before (n=5), during (n=4), and after (n=4) the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. After fixation, ovaries were wax-embedded, serially sectioned, and analyzed for both protein and mRNA expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2. mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled ovine riboprobes. A similar pattern of expression was observed for mRNA and protein for all of the factors. Both mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2 in the granulosa and theca cells of follicles >or=2mm in diameter was significantly different among the stages of the estrous cycle, with the highest expression detected at the post-LH surge stage. Theca cells expressed significantly greater levels of the six angiogenic factors compared with granulosa cells at all stages of the estrous cycle. Expression levels in granulosa and theca cells were comparable between small (2.0 to 2.5mm) and medium (2.5 to 4.0mm) follicles, but large follicles (>4.0mm) expressed higher mRNA and protein levels (all P<0.05) for all factors at all stages of the estrous cycle. These data show (i) that VEGF, VEGFR-2, and the Ang-Tie system are present in both granulosa and theca cells of the ovarian follicle, (ii) that thecal cells consistently express greater levels of all of these factors compared with granulosa cells, and (iii) that their levels of expression are related to the stage of the estrous cycle and to follicle size.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["M W HChowdhury", "R JScaramuzzi", "C P DWheeler-Jones", "MKhalid"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.10.011"}

Grafts were performed with a pool of organ-cultured donor corneas designated for emergency grafting and prepared for immediate use with all safety tests performed. Assignation criteria were: corneas with a small superficial stromal opacity but meeting all selection criteria for PKP tissue and corneas without stromal opacity, but an endothelial cell density from 1800 to 2300 cells/mm(2) or mild polymegathism or pleomorphism. Cox multivariate regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival and log rank test were applied.\nOf the 131 keratoplasties, 115 could be followed. One eye was lost during surgery because of an expulsive bleeding. In 15 cases, a conjunctival transplantation finished off the penetrating graft. Corneal graft survival was not significantly related to the presence of PKP quality of the donor endothelium, neither with a cloudy graft nor with endothelial decompensation as the cause of failure. Main risk factors for a failed graft were vascularization of the host cornea (p=0.0001), the presence of a systemic auto immune disease in the recipient (p=0.003) and the disease leading to the (imminent) perforation and emergency graft (p=0.021).\nA selected pool of donor corneas designated for emergency grafting that does not interfere with the scheduled procedures allows more efficient and safe use of donor tissue in case of a(n) (imminent) perforation.

Stable knockdown of BRCA1 alone in MCF10A cells led to centrosome amplification, impaired p53 protein stability, increased sensitivity towards DNA-damaging agents, defective chromosomal condensation at mitosis and elevated protein levels of cyclin D1 and c-myc. While over-expression of mutant H-Ras transformed MCF10A cells, depletion of BRCA1 dramatically enhanced the in vivo tumorigenesis that was associated with higher levels of VEGF, enhanced vascularization and less apoptosis in the BRCA1-deficient Ras-transformed tumors. The Ras-transformed BRCA1-deficient tumors exhibited features of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, appeared to secrete matrix metalloproteases as visualized by in vivo bio-imaging of tumors using fluorescent probe MMP680, and were locally metastatic to lymph nodes. Our results suggest that loss of BRCA1 function may contribute to the aggressiveness of Ras-MAPK driven human breast cancer with associated increase in levels of cyclin D1 and c-myc, enhanced MAPK activity, angiogenic potential & invasiveness.

{"title": "Evolution of primary hemostasis in early vertebrates.", "abstract": "Hemostasis is a defense mechanism which protects the organism in the event of injury to stop bleeding. Recently, we established that all the known major mammalian hemostatic factors are conserved in early vertebrates. However, since their highly vascularized gills experience high blood pressure and are exposed to the environment, even very small injuries could be fatal to fish. Since trypsins are forerunners for coagulation proteases and are expressed by many extrapancreatic cells such as endothelial cells and epithelial cells, we hypothesized that trypsin or trypsin-like proteases from gill epithelial cells may protect these animals from gill bleeding following injuries. In this paper we identified the release of three different trypsins from fish gills into water under stress or injury, which have tenfold greater serine protease activity compared to bovine trypsin. We found that these trypsins activate the thrombocytes and protect the fish from gill bleeding. We found 27 protease-activated receptors (PARs) by analyzing zebrafish genome and classified them into five groups, based on tethering peptides, and two families, PAR1 and PAR2, based on homologies. We also found a canonical member of PAR2 family, PAR2-21A which is activated more readily by trypsin, and PAR2-21A tethering peptide stops gill bleeding just as trypsin. This finding provides evidence that trypsin cleaves a PAR2 member on thrombocyte surface. In conclusion, we believe that the gills are evolutionarily selected to produce trypsin to activate PAR2 on thrombocyte surface and protect the gills from bleeding. We also speculate that trypsin may also protect the fish from bleeding from other body injuries due to quick contact with the thrombocytes. Thus, this finding provides evidence for the role of trypsins in primary hemostasis in early vertebrates.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2009-12-29", "authors": ["SeongcheolKim", "MairaCarrillo", "VrindaKulkarni", "PudurJagadeeswaran"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0008403"}
{"title": "Contemporary reconstruction of the mandible.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of the mandible has evolved significantly over the last 40years. Early attempts were often disfiguring and wrought with complications but with the introduction of free tissue transfer of well vascularized bone in the 1970's there was a significant improvement in outcomes. In recent years the harvest, inset, and microvascular anatomosis have been refined to the point that success rates are reported as high as 99% throughout the literature. Focus has now shifted to optimizing functional and aesthetic outcomes after mandible reconstruction. This paper will be a review defect classification, goals of reconstruction, the various donor sites, dental rehabilitation, new advances, and persistent problems. Reconstruction of segmental mandibular defects after ablative surgery is best accomplished using free tissue transfer to restore mandibular continuity and function. Reestablishing occlusion and optimizing tongue mobility are important to post-operative oral function. Persistent problems in oro-mandibular reconstruction relate to the effects of radiation treatment on the native tissue and include xerostomia, dysgeusia, osteoradionecrosis and trismus.

The FET was carried out in the natural menstrual cycle 3-4 days after the first positive LH test result. Blood samples for hormonal analysis were collected, and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonographic examination was performed on the day of the FET and repeated with analysis of the total hCG one week later.\nThe demographic, clinical, and embryological characteristics were similar between the pregnant (15/30) and nonpregnant groups (15/30). There were no differences between the groups in endometrial/subendometrial thickness, volume, or vascularization index (VI). The endometrial triple-line pattern was more often present in the pregnant group on the day of the FET (93.3% vs. 40.0%, 95% CI 25.5-81.2%). No differences in the ovaries were observed on the day of the FET. At the second visit, the triple-line pattern was still more often present in those patients who had conceived (91.7% vs. 42.9%, 95% CI 18.5-79.1%), and their corpus luteum was more active as judged by the rise in 17-hydroxyprogesterone and estradiol levels. No differences were observed in the dominant ovarian vasculature.\nAccording to our results, measurement of power Doppler indices using 3D ultrasound on the day of the FET does not provide any additional information concerning the outcome of the cycle.

By targeting the biotin component of the anti-iNOS probe with streptavidin Cy3, fluorescence imaging confirmed the specificity of the probe for iNOS in glioma tissue. iNOS levels in glioma tumors were also confirmed via Western blots and immunohistochemistry. The presence of plasma membrane-associated iNOS in glioma cells was established by transmission electron microscopy and gold-labeled anti-iNOS Ab. The more aggressive RG2 glioma was not found to have higher levels of iNOS compared to C6.

The mechanisms of inflammatory lymphangiogenesis during bacterial infection, toll-like receptor ligand administration, and wound healing are well characterized and depend on ligands for the vascular endothelial grow factor receptor (VEGFR) 3 that are produced by infiltrating macrophages. But inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in nonlymphoid tissues during chronic viral infection is unstudied. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection of the cornea is a leading cause of blindness and depends on aberrant host immune responses to antigen within the normally immunologically privileged cornea. We report that corneal HSV-1 infection drives lymphangiogenesis and that corneal lymphatics persist past the resolution of infection. The mechanism of HSV-1-induced lymphangiogenesis was distinct from the described mechanisms of inflammatory lymphangiogenesis. HSV-1-elicited lymphangiogenesis was strictly dependent on VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling but not on VEGFR-3 ligands. Macrophages played no role in the induction of lymphangiogenesis and were not a detectable source of VEGF-A.

There was an increase in the stratified epithelium layers as well as edema produced by the increase of vascularization in the propia submucosa and infiltration of leukocytes. The proliferation of the vaginal epithelium favors the settlement and persistence of the parasitic infection. All of the findings corresponded with signs of a systemic disease being observed in the animals, including significant weight loss and also intestinal invasion. The entire inflammatory process has been corroborated by studies of adhesion molecules such as E-Selectin, VCAM-1 and PECAM-1. A correlation between the time of appearance and the perseverance of the inflammatory process with E-Selectin and VCAM-1 expression was observed, but not with PECAM-1. The strain with a higher pathogenicity was able to invade deep vaginal tissues and thus, parasites could not be detected by vaginal washings. This may be an important cause of diagnosis and treatment failure.

We found enhanced tumor progression and metastasis in the absence of Ctsl. As tumor progression in K14-HPV16 mice is dependent on inflammation and angiogenesis, we examined immune cell infiltration and vascularization without finding any effect of the Ctsl genotype. In contrast, keratinocyte-specific transgenic expression of cathepsin V, the human orthologue of mouse Ctsl, in otherwise Ctsl-deficient K14-HPV16 mice restored the phenotype observed in the control HPV16 skin. To better understand this phenotype at the molecular level, we measured several oncogenic signal transduction pathways in primary keratinocytes on stimulation with keratinocyte-conditioned cell culture medium. We found increased activation of protein kinase B/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in protease-deficient cells, especially if treated with media conditioned by Ctsl-deficient keratinocytes. Similarly, the level of active GTP-Ras was increased in Ctsl-deficient epidermis.

{"title": "Neural stem cells as a novel platform for tumor-specific delivery of therapeutic antibodies.", "abstract": "Recombinant monoclonal antibodies have emerged as important tools for cancer therapy. Despite the promise shown by antibody-based therapies, the large molecular size of antibodies limits their ability to efficiently penetrate solid tumors and precludes efficient crossing of the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, poorly vascularized solid tumors and CNS metastases cannot be effectively treated by intravenously-injected antibodies. The inherent tumor-tropic properties of human neural stem cells (NSCs) can potentially be harnessed to overcome these obstacles and significantly improve cancer immunotherapy. Intravenously-delivered NSCs preferentially migrate to primary and metastatic tumor sites within and outside the CNS. Therefore, we hypothesized that NSCs could serve as an ideal cellular delivery platform for targeting antibodies to malignant tumors.\nAs proof-of-concept, we selected Herceptin (trastuzumab), a monoclonal antibody widely used to treat HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. HER2 overexpression in breast cancer is highly correlated with CNS metastases, which are inaccessible to trastuzumab therapy. Therefore, NSC-mediated delivery of trastuzumab may improve its therapeutic efficacy. Here we report, for the first time, that human NSCs can be genetically modified to secrete anti-HER2 immunoglobulin molecules. These NSC-secreted antibodies assemble properly, possess tumor cell-binding affinity and specificity, and can effectively inhibit the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in vitro. We also demonstrate that immunoglobulin-secreting NSCs exhibit preferential tropism to tumor cells in vivo, and can deliver antibodies to human breast cancer xenografts in mice.\nTaken together, these results suggest that NSCs modified to secrete HER2-targeting antibodies constitute a promising novel platform for targeted cancer immunotherapy. Specifically, this NSC-mediated antibody delivery system has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcome for patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2009-12-18", "authors": ["Richard TFrank", "MarissaEdmiston", "Stephen EKendall", "JosephNajbauer", "Chia-WeiCheung", "ThewodrosKassa", "Marianne ZMetz", "Seung UKim", "Carlotta AGlackin", "Anna MWu", "Paul JYazaki", "Karen SAboody"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0008314"}

Recent advances in Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIF) molecular network led to targeted therapies, but unfortunately with only limited clinical significance. Elucidating the molecular processes involved in kidney tumorigenesis and resistance is central to the development of improved therapies, not only for kidney cancer but for many, if not all, cancer types. The oncogenic PI3K/Akt, NF-kB and MAPK pathways are critical for tumorigenesis. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is crucial to normal development.\nBy quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot, we report that the SHH signaling pathway is constitutively reactivated in tumors independently of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene expression which is inactivated in the majority of CRCC. The inhibition of the SHH signaling pathway by the specific inhibitor cyclopamine abolished CRCC cell growth as assessed by cell counting, BrdU incorporation studies, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and beta-galactosidase staining. Importantly, inhibition of the SHH pathway induced tumor regression in nude mice through inhibition of cell proliferation and neo-vascularization, and induction of apoptosis but not senescence assessed by in vivo studies, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. Gli1, cyclin D1, Pax2, Lim1, VEGF, and TGF-beta were exclusively expressed in tumors and were shown to be regulated by SHH, as evidenced by immunoblot after SHH inhibition. Using specific inhibitors and immunoblot, the activation of the oncogenic PI3K/Akt, NF-kB and MAPK pathways was decreased by SHH inhibition.\nThese findings support targeting SHH for the treatment of CRCC and pave the way for innovative and additional investigations in a broad range of cancers.", "journal": "Molecular cancer", "date": "2009-12-18", "authors": ["Val\u00e9rianDormoy", "SabrinaDanilin", "V\u00e9roniqueLindner", "LionelThomas", "SylvieRothhut", "CatherineCoquard", "Jean-JacquesHelwig", "DidierJacqmin", "Herv\u00e9Lang", "ThierryMassfelder"], "doi": "10.1186/1476-4598-8-123\n10.1016/j.canlet.2005.08.020\n10.1097/MOU.0b013e3282c508e0\n10.1016/S0022-5347(05)67889-5\n10.1056/NEJMoa065044\n10.1056/NEJMoa060655\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991201)86:11+<2478::AID-CNCR4>3.0.CO;2-5\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1865\n10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00048-X\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1469\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0632\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5311\n10.1016/j.canlet.2008.02.016\n10.1172/JCI32086\n10.1097/PAP.0b013e3180ca8a1d\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6600922\n10.1038/modpathol.3800320\n10.1038/39918\n10.1038/nature01972\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0166\n10.1016/j.cub.2006.11.033\n10.1007/s11010-008-9708-6\n10.1073/pnas.0700776104\n10.1016/S0090-4295(99)80153-8\n10.1016/S0090-4295(98)00019-3\n10.1111/j.1442-2042.2004.00931.x\n10.1074/jbc.M108927200\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104340\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4588\n10.1097/00042307-200209000-00001\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-1968"}

In group B (n = 20), there was no vascular carrier, and the same dimensional coral was directly implanted beneath inguinal skin. After 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, the rabbits were perfused with heparinized saline (for scanning electron microscopy), India ink (for histological examination), and ethylene perchloride (for vascular casts) via the abdominal aorta. In group A, histology showed that newly formed vasculature extended over the surfaces and invaded the entire coral blocks. The vascular density was significantly superior to that in group B. Vascular casts showed that new blood vessels robustly sprouted from the AVL. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that there were minute sprouting cavities in the vascular endangium.

Further, after anastomosis, thrombosis is a major complication arising due to vasoconstriction. Therefore, we decided to apply lidocaine topically on the recipient artery to prevent postoperative vasospasm. We had applied lidocaine topically on the recipient artery in seven patients with persistent vasospasm before the completion of the surgery. After surgery, 0.2 mL lidocaine (4%) was directly applied on the vascularized region every 15 minutes for the first 3 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours, and every 1 hour for the next 18 hours. Although four patients experienced a disturbance in the blood flow immediately after the surgery, they showed improvements after lidocaine application. In three of these four patients, vasospasm was also suspected to occur at 15 minutes after the surgery; however, topical application of lidocaine was found to be effective in these patients. Thrombosis was not observed in any case. We believe that if the site of lidocaine application is appropriate, even a small dose of low-concentration lidocaine (4%) can produce an adequate effect.

In this study, we examined the process of BSP formation in the rhodopsin knockout (rho (-/-)) mouse, a murine model for human RP.\nIn rho (-/-) mice from 2 to 16 months of age, representing the range from early to late stages of degeneration, retinal sections and whole mounts were examined morphologically by light and electron microscopy. The results were compared to scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of BSP degeneration in human RP.\nAfter the loss of all photoreceptor cells in rho-/- mice, the outer retina successively degenerated, leading to approximation and finally a direct contact of inner retinal vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We could show that it was the event of proximity of retinal vessel and RPE that triggered migration of RPE cells along the contacting vessels towards the inner retina. Ultrastructurally, these mislocalized RPE cells partially sealed the vessels by tight junction linkage and deposited extracellular matrix perivascularly. Also, the vascular endothelium developed fenestrations similar to the RPE-choroid interface. In whole mounts, the pigmented cell clusters outlining retinal capillaries correlated well with BSPs in human RP. The structure of the inner retina remained well preserved, even in late stages.\nThe Rho (-/-) mouse is the first animal model that depicts all major pathological changes, even in the late stages of RP. Using the rho (-/-) mouse model we were able to analyze the complete dynamic process of BSP formation. Therefore we conclude that: (1) In rho (-/-) retinas, BSPs only form in areas devoid of photoreceptors; (2) Direct contact between inner retinal vessels and RPE appears to be a major trigger for migration of RPE cells; (3) The distribution of the RPE cells in BSPs reflects the vascular network at the time of formation.

The pathology of onchocerciasis is principally considered to be a consequence of long-standing host inflammatory responses. In onchocerciasis a subcutaneous nodule is formed around the female worms, the core of which is a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells in which microfilariae are released. It has been established that the formation of nodules is associated with angiogenesis. In this study, we show using specific markers of endothelium (CD31) and lymphatic endothelial cells (Lyve-1, Podoplanin) that not only angiogenesis but also lymphangiogenesis occurs within the nodule. 7% of the microfilariae could be found within the lymphatics, but none within blood vessels in these nodules, suggesting a possible route of migration for the larvae. The neovascularisation was associated with a particular pattern of angio/lymphangiogenic factors in nodules of onchocerciasis patients, characterized by the expression of CXCL12, CXCR4, VEGF-C, Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2. Interestingly, a proportion of macrophages were found to be positive for Lyve-1 and some were integrated into the endothelium of the lymphatic vessels, revealing their plasticity in the nodular micro-environment.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of permanent perfusion on fat flaps of the rat.\nWe elevated an epigastric adipofascial flap based on the inferior superficial epigastric vessels bilaterally in male Lewis rats and connected it to a bioreactor. The system was run by a cable pump and filled either with Hannover or Eurocollin's solution with or without permanent perfusion for 10 days. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in each solution was analyzed every 48 hours, assuming that injured cells emit this enzyme to the extracellular space and consequently to the perfusion solution. Histological samples were analyzed at the end of each trial.\nThere was a continuous significantly greater LDH level (P < .001) in bioreactors perfused with Hannover than with Eurocollin's solution. The nonperfused bioreactors showed a similar finding with lower levels compared with their perfused equivalents. Histological examination revealed significantly better preserved (P < .001) fat tissue structures in Hannover solution-perfused specimens.\nBecause LDH has a half life of 24 hours, ongoing production of this enzyme for 10 days is a marker for an injured tissue consisting of viable cells. Bioreactors run with Hannover solution showed significantly higher LDH levels. Histological analyses revealed intact cells preserved in Hannover solution. Thus, Hannover solution seemed to be superior to Eurocollin's solution to keep flaps viable under normothermic conditions. The presented model facilitated fat tissue conservation under normothermic conditions and represented a foundation for further studies on the differentiation of vascularized fat tissue.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["CHerold", "KReimers", "CAllmeling", "H ORennekampff", "P MVogt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.09.058"}

This may be achieved by hydroxyapatite loading of distinct scaffold biomaterials. Herein, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo properties of a novel nanosize hydroxyapatite particles/poly(ester-urethane) (nHA/PU) composite scaffold which was prepared by a salt leaching-phase inverse process. Microtomography, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy analyses demonstrated the capability of the material processing to create a three-dimensional porous PU scaffold with nHA on the surface. Compared to nHA-free PU scaffolds (control), this modified scaffold type induced a significant increase in in vitro adsorption of model proteins. In vivo analysis of the inflammatory and angiogenic host tissue response to implanted nHA/PU scaffolds in the dorsal skinfold chamber model indicated that the incorporation of nHA particles into the scaffold material did not affect biocompatibility and vascularization when compared to control scaffolds. Thus, nHA/PU composite scaffolds represent a promising new type of scaffold for bone tissue engineering, combining the flexible material properties of PU with the advantage of an osteoconductive surface.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["M WLaschke", "AStrohe", "M DMenger", "MAlini", "DEglin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2009.12.004"}
{"title": "A comparative study of the spatial distribution of mast cells and microvessels in the foetal, adult human thymus and thymoma.", "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) are widely distributed in human and animal tissues and have been shown to play an important role in angiogenesis in normal and pathological conditions. Few data are available about the relationship between MCs and blood vessels in the normal human thymus, and there are virtually no data about their distribution and significance in thymoma. The aim of this study was to analyse the spatial distribution of MCs and microvessels in the normal foetal and adult thymus and thymoma. Twenty biopsy specimens of human thymus, including foetal and adult normal thymus and thymoma were analysed. Double staining with CD34 and mast cell tryptase was used to count both mast cells and microvessels in the same fields. Computer-assisted image analysis was performed to characterize the spatial distribution of MCs and blood vessels in selected specimens. Results demonstrated that MCs were localized exclusively to the medulla. Their number was significantly higher in thymoma specimens as compared with adult and foetal normal specimens respectively. In contrast the microvessel area was unchanged. The analysis of the spatial distribution and relationship between MCs and microvessels revealed that only in the thymoma specimens was there a significant spatial association between MCs and microvessels. Overall, these data suggest that MCs do not contribute significantly to the development of the vascular network in foetal and adult thymus, whereas in thymoma they show a close relationship to blood vessels.

{"title": "Predictive Potential of Angiogenic Growth Factors and Circulating Endothelial Cells in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Metronomic Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab.", "abstract": "PURPOSE: The association of chemotherapy and antiangiogenic drugs has shown efficacy in clinical oncology. However, there is a need for biomarkers that allow selection of patients who are likely to benefit from such treatment and are useful for indicating best drug combination and schedule. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the predictive potential of six angiogenic molecules/transcripts and nine subpopulations of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and progenitors (CEP) in 46 patients with advanced breast cancer treated with metronomic cyclophosphamide and capecitabine plus bevacizumab. RESULTS: Median time to progression was 281 days. Baseline CECs higher than the first quartile were associated with an increased time to progression (P = 0.021). At progression, CECs were markedly reduced (P = 0.0002). In the cohort of 15 long-term responders, who progressed later than 1 year after beginning of therapy, circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A levels measured after 2 months of therapy were significantly reduced, and there were significant trends toward lower levels of PDGF-BB, CEPs, and CECs. At the time of progression, angiogenic growth factors VEGF-A and basic fibroblast growth factor were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline CECs (likely reflecting an active vascular turnover) predicted a prolonged clinical benefit. At the time of relapse, a pattern of decreased CECs and increased angiogenic growth factors suggested a switch toward a different type of cancer vascularization. VEGF-A and basic fibroblast growth factor levels after 2 months of therapy were also useful to identify patients whose disease was likely to progress. These biomarkers are likely to be useful for treatment selection and might be incorporated in design of future studies.

We investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of systemic blockade of VEGF-A by the inhibitory monoclonal antibody G6-31, employing a therapeutic trial in a mouse model of psoriasis. Simultaneous deletion of JunB and c-Jun (DKO*) in the epidermis of adult mice leads to a psoriasis-like phenotype with hyper- and parakeratosis and increased subepidermal vascularization. Moreover, an inflammatory infiltrate and elevated levels of cytokines/chemokines including TNFalpha, IL-1alpha/beta, IL-6, and the innate immune mediators IL-22, IL-23, IL-23R, and IL-12p40 are detected. Here we show that anti-VEGF antibody treatment of mice already displaying disease symptoms resulted in an overall improvement of the psoriatic lesions leading to a reduction in the number of blood vessels and a significant decrease in the size of dermal blood and lymphatic vessels. Importantly, anti-VEGF-treated mice showed a pronounced reduction of inflammatory cells within the dermis and a normalization of epidermal differentiation.

{"title": "MRI of prostate brachytherapy seeds at high field: a study in phantom.", "abstract": "Postimplant evaluation of prostate brachytherapy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T has met with some difficulties due to the uncertainty associated with seed localization despite the excellent anatomical delineation this imaging modality can achieve. Seeds in vascularized regions or outside the prostate, where signal heterogeneity or drop off can obscure their position, can be difficult to identify. The increase in SNR available at 3.0 T offers the potential to improve these issues with visualization. However, before moving directly to in vivo studies, it is important to investigate the effects of artifact size on the ability to localize multiple seeds in close proximity. These artifacts are of extra concern at higher field because of the increased induced field distortions surrounding the seeds. A single prostate brachytherapy seed (IMC6711, OncoSeed) and arrays of seed pairs were suspended in a porcine gel medium and imaged on 1.5 and 3 T MRI scanners for comparison. Two basic acquisition techniques utilized in a wide array of clinical sequences [spin-echo based and gradient-echo (GE) based] were investigated for the types of artifacts they produce, and their dependence on field. Analysis of the resulting voids was performed to determine the relative size of seeds as seen on the images, as well as the ability to distinguish seeds at close proximity. The seed voids at 3 T were only slightly larger than those obtained at 1.5 T (0.5 mm longer and wider) when using a spin-echo type sequence. For this work, the authors used a proton density fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence. These results are promising for the use of 3 T imaging for postimplant evaluation since the SNR will increase by roughly a factor of 2 with only a limited corresponding increase in artifact size. The minimum separation of the seeds to be completely distinguished using void analysis increased from between 1.5 and 3 mm to between 3 and 4.5 mm when going from 1.5 to 3 T FSE imaging. The minimum separation of the seeds for GE at the demonstration TE of 11 ms was found to be between 3 and 4.5 mm for 1.5 T and between 4.5 and 6 mm for 3 T. These GE artifact dimensions will scale down with TE and, as this happens, approach the dimensions of the FSE artifacts given above.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2009-12-10", "authors": ["S DThomas", "KWachowicz", "B GFallone"], "doi": "10.1118/1.3244036"}

In the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering, mechanical stimuli and formation of a vascular network that transport oxygen to cells within the pores of the scaffolds are essential. Angiogenesis and cell differentiation have been simulated in scaffolds of regular porosity; however, the dynamics of differentiation can be different when the porosity is not uniform. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the mechanical stimuli and the capillary network formation on cell differentiation within a scaffold of irregular morphology. A porous scaffold of calcium phosphate based glass was used. The pores and the solid phase were discretized using micro computed tomography images. Cell activity was simulated within the interconnected pore domain of the scaffold using a lattice modeling approach. Compressive strains of 0.5 and 1% of total deformation were applied and two cases of mesenchymal stem cells initialization (in vitro seeding and in vivo) were simulated. Similar capillary networks were formed independently of the cell initialization mode and the magnitude of the mechanical strain applied. Most of vessels grew in the pores at the periphery of the scaffolds and were blocked by the walls of the scaffold. When 0.5% of strain was applied, 70% of the pore volume was affected by mechano-regulatory stimuli corresponding to bone formation; however, because of the lack of oxygen, only 40% of the volume was filled with osteoblasts. 40% of volume was filled with chondrocytes and 3% with fibroblasts. When the mechanical strain was increased to 1%, 11% of the pore volume was filled with osteoblasts, 59% with chondrocytes, and 8% with fibroblasts.

The aim of this study was to evaluate an algorithm using CT-scans and Gastrografin in the management of small bowel obstruction.\nIn a prospective study, each patient admitted for small bowel obstruction underwent a physical examination, a plain film, and a CT-scan evaluation. Patients underwent emergency surgical exploration when bowel ischemia was suspected. Other patients received oral Gastrografin, and a second plain abdominal radiograph was done after 12 hours. In patients with clinical improvement, the nasogastric tube was removed and an immediate liquid diet was resumed. Other patients were referred for surgery.\nIn total, 118 patients with 123 episodes of small bowel obstruction were included. Thirty-six (29%) required immediate surgery because they presented clinical characteristics of bowel ischemia (36/36; 100%) or a defect in vascularization of the small bowel on CT-scan (5/36; 14%). The 87 remaining patients were managed nonoperatively, of which 28 deteriorated and were referred for surgery. The 59 other patients showed clinical improvement.\nThis study demonstrated the diagnostic role of Gastrografin(R) in discriminating between partial and complete small bowel obstruction.

{"title": "Functional muscle regeneration with combined delivery of angiogenesis and myogenesis factors.", "abstract": "Regenerative efforts typically focus on the delivery of single factors, but it is likely that multiple factors regulating distinct aspects of the regenerative process (e.g., vascularization and stem cell activation) can be used in parallel to affect regeneration of functional tissues. This possibility was addressed in the context of ischemic muscle injury, which typically leads to necrosis and loss of tissue and function. The role of sustained delivery, via injectable gel, of a combination of VEGF to promote angiogenesis and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) to directly promote muscle regeneration and the return of muscle function in ischemic rodent hindlimbs was investigated. Sustained VEGF delivery alone led to neoangiogenesis in ischemic limbs, with complete return of tissue perfusion to normal levels by 3 weeks, as well as protection from hypoxia and tissue necrosis, leading to an improvement in muscle contractility. Sustained IGF1 delivery alone was found to enhance muscle fiber regeneration and protected cells from apoptosis. However, the combined delivery of VEGF and IGF1 led to parallel angiogenesis, reinnervation, and myogenesis; as satellite cell activation and proliferation was stimulated, cells were protected from apoptosis, the inflammatory response was muted, and highly functional muscle tissue was formed. In contrast, bolus delivery of factors did not have any benefit in terms of neoangiogenesis and perfusion and had minimal effect on muscle regeneration. These results support the utility of simultaneously targeting distinct aspects of the regenerative process.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2009-12-08", "authors": ["CristinaBorselli", "HannahStorrie", "FrankBenesch-Lee", "DmitryShvartsman", "ChristineCezar", "Jeff WLichtman", "Herman HVandenburgh", "David JMooney"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0903875106"}
{"title": "Mechanisms of myocardium-coronary vessel interaction.", "abstract": "The mechanisms by which the contracting myocardium exerts extravascular forces (intramyocardial pressure, IMP) on coronary blood vessels and by which it affects the coronary flow remain incompletely understood. Several myocardium-vessel interaction (MVI) mechanisms have been proposed, but none can account for all the major flow features. In the present study, we hypothesized that only a specific combination of MVI mechanisms can account for all observed coronary flow features. Three basic interaction mechanisms (time-varying elasticity, myocardial shortening-induced intracellular pressure, and ventricular cavity-induced extracellular pressure) and their combinations were analyzed based on physical principles (conservation of mass and force equilibrium) in a realistic data-based vascular network. Mechanical properties of both vessel wall and myocardium were coupled through stress analysis to simulate the response of vessels to internal blood pressure and external (myocardial) mechanical loading. Predictions of transmural dynamic vascular pressure, diameter, and flow velocity were determined under each MVI mechanism and compared with reported data. The results show that none of the three basic mechanisms alone can account for the measured data. Only the combined effect of the cavity-induced extracellular pressure and the shortening-induced intramyocyte pressure provides good agreement with the majority of measurements.

Endothelial cell activation, in turn, is mediated primarily at the level of gene transcription. Here, we show that in response to several activation agonists, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and thrombin, endothelial cells demonstrate rapid and profound induction of the early growth response (Egr) genes egr-1 and egr-3. In VEGF-treated endothelial cells, induction of Egr-3 was far greater and more prolonged compared with Egr-1. VEGF-mediated stimulation of Egr-3 involved the inducible binding of NFATc, serum response factor, and CREB to their respective consensus motifs in the upstream promoter region of Egr-3. Knockdown of Egr-3 markedly impaired VEGF-mediated proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells and blocked VEGF-induced monocyte adhesion. Egr-3 knockdown abrogated VEGF-mediated vascular outgrowth from ex vivo aortic rings and attenuated Matrigel plug vascularization and melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that Egr-3 is a critical determinant of VEGF signaling in activated endothelial cells.

The behavior of the wall-filter selection curve in a multiple-vessel region of interest is studied using a custom-designed multiple-vessel flow phantom. The flow phantom is capable of mimicking a range of blood vessel sizes (200-300 microm), blood flow velocities (1-10 mm/s), and blood vessel orientations (long-axis and transverse). At high flow rates, single-vessel wall-filter selection curves superimpose to produce a multiple-vessel curve where the CPD at the left-most plateau corresponds with the actual vascular volume fraction.

Correcting penile curvature is an essential step in proximal hypospadias surgery. It is logical to lengthen the ventral radius using a graft; however, penile curvature would recur owing to a graft contracture with inadequate vascularization. Although a tunica vaginalis is considered a suitable material to be used as a flap instead of a graft, clinical application of this technique is uncommon. Information regarding the usefulness and effectiveness of this procedure is required.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, we repaired 146 patients with hypospadias and the urethral plate was transected in 39 patients because of severe curvature. Significant severe curvature persisting even after transection of the plate was corrected with ventral corporeal lengthening procedures using a tunica vaginalis flap in 15 patients and postoperative results were evaluated.\nStraight penile erection was identified in all 15 boys at home by their parents. In 7 of the 15 boys, artificial erection was performed at the time of additional surgery; 5 degrees of curvature was found in 2 patients and 0 degree in 5.\nAt the second session of surgery, we observed that penile straightening was maintained without recurrence of curvature.

{"title": "Effect of aerobic exercise on tumor physiology in an animal model of human breast cancer.", "abstract": "Recent epidemiologic studies report that regular exercise may be associated with substantial reductions in cancer-specific and all-cause mortality following a breast cancer diagnosis. The mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been identified. We investigated the effects of long-term voluntary wheel running on growth and progression using an animal model of human breast cancer. We also examined effects on the central features of tumor physiology, including markers of tumor blood perfusion/vascularization, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and metabolism. Athymic female mice fed a high-fat diet were orthotopically (direct into the mammary fat pad) implanted with human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 at 1 x 10(6)) into the right dorsal mammary fat pad and randomly assigned (1:1) to voluntary wheel running (n = 25) or a nonintervention (sedentary) control group (n = 25). Tumor volume was measured every three days using digital calipers. All experimental animals were killed when tumor volume reached > or = 1,500 mm(3). Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis indicated that tumor growth (survival) was comparable between the experimental groups (exercise 44 days vs. control 48 days; KM proportional hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval, 0.77-2.58, P = 0.14). However, tumors from exercising animals had significantly improved blood perfusion/vascularization relative to the sedentary control group (P < 0.05). Histological analyses indicated that intratumoral hypoxia levels (as assessed by hypoxia-inducible factor 1) were significantly higher in the exercise group relative to sedentary control (P < 0.05). Aerobic exercise can significantly increase intratumoral vascularization, leading to \"normalization\" of the tissue microenvironment in human breast tumors. Such findings may have important implications for inhibiting tumor metastasis and improving the efficacy of conventional cancer therapies.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2009-12-05", "authors": ["Lee WJones", "Benjamin LViglianti", "Jessica ATashjian", "Sejal MKothadia", "Stephen TKeir", "Stephen JFreedland", "Michael QPotter", "Eui JungMoon", "ThiesSchroeder", "James EHerndon", "Mark WDewhirst"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00424.2009"}

Recent studies have indicated that adipocyte function is more complex than expected, since these cells have multiple functions and are integrated in a homeostatic network to optimize energy resources. As metabolic sensors in the body, adipocytes and the surrounding stromal vascular cells produce and secrete autocrine, paracrine and endocrine factors, able to regulate aspects involved in the development of adipocytes, as well as effects in peripheral organs important for metabolism. Regulation of these endocrine factors could lead to new therapeutic approaches targeted at aspects related to adipogenesis, preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory cytokine release and secretion, adipose tissue vascularization, and regulation of lipid metabolism or, alternatively, regulation of energy dissipation in mitochondria. In the study of the mechanisms of adipogenesis and remodulation of adipose tissue with respect to adipocyte size and function, an alternative and unorthodox strategy to improve obesity-associated metabolic complications could consist of increasing the storage capacity of adipose tissue to prevent a toxic response known as lipotoxicity.", "journal": "Endocrinologia y nutricion : organo de la Sociedad Espanola de Endocrinologia y Nutricion", "date": "2009-12-05", "authors": ["GemaMedina-G\u00f3mez", "AntonioVidal-Puig"], "doi": "10.1016/S1575-0922(09)72710-X"}

TNFalpha and IL-6 mRNA levels reached an initial peak 3 h posttransplant and a second peak at 9-12 h with equivalent levels in iso- and allografts. A single dose of anti-TNFalpha mAb given at reperfusion decreased neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractant levels and early neutrophil, macrophage and memory CD8 T-cell infiltration into allografts. Anti-TNFalpha mAb also extended graft survival from 8.6+/-0.6 days to 14.1+/-0.8 days. When assessed on day 7 posttransplant, the number of donor-reactive CD8 T cells producing IFN-gamma in the spleen was reduced almost 70% in recipients treated with anti-TNFalpha mAb. Whereas anti-CD154 mAb prolonged survival to day 21, administration of anti-TNFalpha and anti-CD154 mAb delayed rejection to day 32 and resulted in long-term (>80 days) survival of 40% of the heart allografts.

Multiple factors have been identified that influence grading accuracy, such as the knowledge, training, and experience of the observer. The aim of this study was to further explore the effect of knowledge on grading accuracy, both in terms of intensity and specificity, and to do so by avoiding the need to require the subjects to interpolate between whole number grades.\nOptometry students were divided into three knowledge groups according to their academic progress and in such a way that knowledge intensity and specificity could be evaluated separately. A vertical visual analog scale was devised to allow subjects to grade three different conditions of medium severity (position 50 of the scale) from the Institute for Eye Research grading scale, mainly, bulbar hyperemia, limbal vascularization, and lid redness.\nBulbar hyperemia was graded lowest (mean = 21.5; SD = 1.4), followed by limbal vascularization (mean = 40.7; SD = 1.6) and lid redness (mean = 51.2; SD = 1.3), and these differences were found to be statistically significant (ANOVA, p = 0.000). Knowledge was found to influence the grading process, resulting in statistically significant differences in the overall grading performance of the three knowledge groups (ANOVA, p = 0.048). Furthermore, even if knowledge intensity failed to improve grading accuracy over a certain threshold, a combination of knowledge intensity and specificity resulted in an enhancement of the homogeneity of the grading data.\nKnowledge intensity and specificity both contribute to improve grading skills, albeit through different mechanisms.

{"title": "Complications of limb salvage surgery in childhood tumors and recommended solutions.", "abstract": "Bone and soft tissue malignancies are associated with serious diagnostic and therapeutic problems in every level of pubertal growth in children. Current treatment modality preferred in bone and soft tissue tumors is wide resection of tumor followed by the reconstruction of consequent defect by various methods. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are applied for systemic effects to the patient pre- and post-operatively and for local effects that facilitate the surgical procedure. Mostly, it is very difficult to control problems following wide resection and reconstruction. In this study, our aim is to discuss the problems encountered in different resection and reconstruction approaches in childhood bone and soft tissue tumors, and the recommended solutions addressed to these problems. From 1990 to 2003, a total of 68 patients (38 female, 30 male) with a mean age of 13.1 (1.5-18) were included in the study. 85.3% of patients were diagnosed as osteosarcoma and the rest was Ewing's sarcoma. Seventy-five percent of patients had stage IIB disease. The lesions of 34 patients were detected to be in distal femur, 26 in proximal tibia and fibula, 4 in foot and ankle joint, and the remaining 4 in pelvis. As reconstructive surgery, 40 patients had modular prosthesis, vascularized fibular graft was performed in 13 patients, and 10 patients underwent arthrodesis with vascularized fibular graft. 20.6% of patients had shortened limb, infection was detected in 4 patients, laxity in 5, and restricted motion in 4 as complication of prosthesis. With sacrificed physis, 13 patients had a mean value of 4.6 cm limb shortness. Limb salvage surgery has been considered as the gold standard treatment in orthopedic oncological surgery. More understanding of the biology of sarcoma, introduction of new effective chemotherapeutic agents, development of new techniques concerning the surgical resection, advances in diagnostic methods, and improvements in reconstructive surgery all make a major contribution to limb salvage surgery.

In vascularized transplantation models, the spleen contributes to graft rejection by generating alloantigen reactive T cells. The immune response in allograft rejection involves a cascade of molecular events leading to the formation of immunological synapses between T cells and the antigen-presenting cells.\nTo elucidate the molecular pathways involved in the immunosuppressive function of allochimeric molecule we performed microarray and quantitative RTPCR analyses of gene expression profile of splenic T cells from untreated, CsA treated, and allochimeric molecule + subtherapeutic dose of CsA treated animals at day 1, 3 and 7 of post transplantation. Allochimeric molecule treatment caused down regulation of genes involved in actin filament polymerization (RhoA and Rac1), cell adhesion (Catna1, Vcam and CD9), vacuolar transport (RhoB, Cln8 and ATP6v1b2), and MAPK pathway (Spred1 and Dusp6) involved in tubulin cytoskeleton reorganization and interaction between actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. All these genes are involved in T cell polarity and motility, i.e., their ability to move, scan and to form functional immunological synapse with antigen presenting cells (APCs).\nThese results indicate that the immunosuppressive function of allochimeric molecule may depend on the impairment of T cells' movement and scanning ability, and possibly also the formation of immunological synapse.

{"title": "Bioinspired engineering study of Plantae vascules for self-healing composite structures.", "abstract": "This paper presents the first conceptual study into creating a Plantae-inspired vascular network within a fibre-reinforced polymer composite laminate, which provides an ongoing self-healing functionality without incurring a mass penalty. Through the application of a 'lost-wax' technique, orthogonal hollow vascules, inspired by the 'ray cell' structures found in ring porous hardwoods, were successfully introduced within a carbon fibre-reinforced epoxy polymer composite laminate. The influence on fibre architecture and mechanical behaviour of single vascules (located on the laminate centreline) when aligned parallel and transverse to the local host ply was characterized experimentally using a compression-after-impact test methodology. Ultrasonic C-scanning and high-resolution micro-CT X-ray was undertaken to identify the influence of and interaction between the internal vasculature and impact damage. The results clearly show that damage morphology is influenced by vascule orientation and that a 10 J low-velocity impact damage event is sufficient to breach the vasculature; a prerequisite for any subsequent self-healing function. The residual compressive strength after a 10 J impact was found to be dependent upon vascule orientation. In general, residual compressive strength decreased to 70 per cent of undamaged strength when vasculature was aligned parallel to the local host ply and a value of 63 per cent when aligned transverse.

{"title": "Effect of cell seeding and mechanical loading on vascularization and tissue formation inside a scaffold: a mechano-biological model using a lattice approach to simulate cell activity.", "abstract": "Achieving successful vascularization remains one of the main problems in bone tissue engineering. After scaffold implantation, the growth of capillaries into the porous construct may be too slow to provide adequate nutrients to the cells in the scaffold interior and this inhibits tissue formation in the scaffold core. Often, prior to implantation, a controlled cell culture environment is used to stimulate cell proliferation and, once in place, the mechanical environment acting on the tissue construct is determined by the loading conditions at the implantation site. To what extent do cell seeding conditions and the construct loading environment have an effect on scaffold vascularization and tissue growth? In this study, a mechano-biological model for tissue differentiation and blood vessel growth was used to determine the influence of cell seeding on vascular network development and tissue growth inside a regular-structured bone scaffold under different loading conditions. It is predicted that increasing the number of cells seeded homogeneously reduces the rate of vascularization and the maximum penetration of the vascular network, which in turn reduces bone tissue formation. The seeding of cells in the periphery of the scaffold was predicted to be beneficial for vascularization and therefore for bone growth; however, tissue formation occurred more slowly during the first weeks after implantation compared to homogeneous seeding. Low levels of mechanical loading stimulated bone formation while high levels of loading inhibited bone formation and capillary growth.

We used this model to assess femoral head deformation and repair in vivo by sequential magnetic resonance imaging and by correlating end-stage findings with histologic assessments.\nIschemic necrosis of the femoral head was induced in ten three-week-old piglets by tying a silk ligature around the base of the femoral neck (intracapsular) and cutting the ligamentum teres. We used magnetic resonance imaging with the piglets under general anesthesia to study the hips at forty-eight hours and at one, two, four, and eight weeks. Measurements on magnetic resonance images in the midcoronal plane of the involved and control sides at each time documented the femoral head height, femoral head width, superior surface cartilage height, and femoral neck-shaft angle. Histologic assessments were done at the time of killing.\nComplete ischemia of the femoral head was identified in all involved femora by magnetic resonance imaging at forty-eight hours. Revascularization began at the periphery of the femoral head as early as one week and was underway in all by two weeks. At eight weeks, magnetic resonance imaging and histologic analysis showed deformation of the femoral head and variable tissue deposition. Tissue responses included (1) vascularized fibroblastic ingrowth with tissue resorption and cartilage, intramembranous bone, and mixed fibro-osseous or fibro-cartilaginous tissue synthesis and (2) resumption of endochondral bone growth. At eight weeks, the mean femoral head measurements (and standard error of the mean) for the control compared with the ligated femora were 10.4 +/- 0.4 and 4.8 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively, for height; 26.7 +/- 0.8 and 31.2 +/- 0.8 mm for diameter; 1.1 +/- 0.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.1 mm for cartilage thickness; and 151 degrees +/- 2 degrees and 135 degrees +/- 2 degrees for the femoral neck-shaft angle. Repeated-measures mixed-model analysis of variance revealed highly significant effects of ligation in each parameter (p < 0.0001).\nMagnetic resonance imaging allows for the assessment of individual hips at sequential time periods to follow deformation and repair. There was a variable tissue response, and histologic assessment at the time of killing was shown to correlate with the evolving and varying magnetic resonance imaging signal intensities. Femoral head height on the ischemic side from one week onward was always less than the initial control value and continually decreased with time, indicating collapse as well as slowed growth.

We hypothesized that inflammation of the intestinal wall is correlated not with the amount of wall vascularization (study of vascularization patterns, SVP) but with the degree of wall flow during a period of time (time-intensity study, TIS). Our objective was to discover whether CEUS SPV and/or CEUS-TIS reflect(s) vascular inflammation of the intestinal wall and display(s) correlation with clinical activity of the disease at the time of the examination (T0) or at the 3- and 6-month follow-up (T3, T6).\n30 patients with Crohn's disease (12 men, 18 women, mean age: 41.96 years; treatment: 5-ASA (n = 8), steroids (n = 13), anti-TNF (n = 7), azathioprine (n = 2) were studied with CEUS SPV and CEUS-TIS and followed for at least 6 months. The sonographic examinations were performed with SonoVue (BR1, Bracco) and a dedicated scanner (TECHNOS MPX, Esaote) equipped with software for calculation of time-intensity curves. Four vascular patterns (1: vascularization of the entire wall; 2: vascularization of >50% of the wall; 3: flow exclusively within the submucosal layer; 4: no signal). The semiquantitative analysis consisted in measurement of the area under the curve (AUC) (cut-off between active and inactive disease, 15), mean intesnity (IMA) (cut-off = 10). Each examination (180 s) was digitally recorded and analyzed.\nT0: cDAI <150 in 22 pts; cDAI > 150 in 8; T3: 22 pts. with cDAI<150, 8 with cDAI >150. At T0 CEUS SPV and CEUS-TIS both displayed low specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and negative predictive values (p = ns).

To perform the resection of glandular tissue, while improving the surgical access and maintaining the nipple-areola vascularization we have developed a new approach for NSM based on the double concentric periareolar incision (DCPI). The purpose of this study is to analyze the feasibility, surgical planning and its outcome following NSM. 18 patients underwent NSM reconstructions. Mean time of follow-up was 29 months. The technique was indicated in patients with small/moderate volume breasts. Flap complications were evaluated and information on aesthetic results and patient satisfaction were collected. 83.3% had tumors measuring 2cm or less (T1) and 72.1% were stage 0 and I. All patients presented peripherally tumors located (at least 5cm from the nipple). Skin complications occurred in 11.1%. One patient (5.5%) presented small skin necrosis and a wound dehiscence was observed in one patient (5.5%). The aesthetic result was good/very good in 94.4 percent and the majority of patients were very satisfied/satisfied. No local recurrences were observed. All complications except one were treated by a conservative approach. DCPI-BEIS is a simple and reliable technique for NSM reconstruction.

{"title": "Contributions to myometrium study in uterine-tubal junction.", "abstract": "Complex coordinated contractions of the tubal musculature are thought to be important for movement of the ovum from the distal end to the proximal end of the tube, while at the same time aiding in the movement of sperm from the proximal end to the distal end of the oviduct. Studies of the anatomy and the physiology of the uterine-tubal junction (UTJ), with a main concern for the muscular pattern and the secretory activity of this part of the tube, in relation with the hormonal and nervous control, can play an important role in understanding and impairment of infertility. Related to these aspects, the purpose of our research is mainly to identify the determining factors in maintaining a morphological and structural balance between contractile items and extracellular matrix items within uterine myometrium, particularly uterine-tubal junction. For this reason, the present study includes analyses of anatomical sections within uterus and uterine tubes extracted from patients during therapeutic surgeries. Thirty anatomical pieces from patients aged 23-37-year-old (uterus and tubes) were used to perform microanatomical sections, 10 pieces for each pathology identified, namely leiomyofibroma, leiomyofibroma with pregnancy, ectopic pregnancies. At the same time, the study proposes a statistic and mathematic analysis of the cases with uterine-tubal junction pathology in Oltenia region within a period of 10 years. The novelty of the study is represented by the identification of certain continuity ratios between myocyte fascicles and average tunica of arteries and arterioles, which explains the existence of \"vascular units\" determined by myometrial structures. Moreover, the stereo-distribution of \"vascular myometrial units\" explains the existence of a plexiform cavernous network, which enables many authors to describe numerous barely individualized myometrial tunicas. These units are rich in orthosympathetic vegetative innervations that might be responsible for the unfavorable evolution of circulatory myometrial system in postpartum. Considering all these observations, it is highly necessary to reconsider the structure of the uterine wall and, particularly of uterine-tubal junction.", "journal": "Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "date": "2009-11-28", "authors": ["M CNeam\u0163u", "R LNeam\u0163u", "Elena TainaAvramescu", "MariaVrabete", "Lucia MirelaC\u0103lina", "IM\u00eendril\u0103"], "doi": null}

We report here the fabrication of angiogenic cell sheets using a combination of two magnetic force-based techniques which use magnetite cationic liposomes (MCLs), magnetofection and magnetic cell accumulation. A retroviral vector encoding an expression cassette of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was labeled with MCLs, to magnetically attract the particles onto a monolayer of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, for gene delivery. MCL-mediated infection increased transduction efficiency by 6.7-fold compared with the conventional method. During the fabrication of the tissue constructs, MCL-labeled cells were accumulated in the presence of a magnetic field to promote the spontaneous formation of a multilayered cell sheet. VEGF gene-engineered C2C12 (C2C12/VEGF) cell sheets, constructed using both magnetic force-based techniques, were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice. Histological analyses revealed that on day 14 the C2C12/VEGF cell sheet grafts had produced thick tissues, with a high-cell density, and promoted vascularization.

Semaphorin (Sema)3E is one of the class 3 semaphorins, and plexinD1 is known to be its receptor. Although these molecules have a role in embryonic vascular development, it remains unclear whether the Sema3E/plexinD1 axis is involved in postnatal angiogenesis.\nThe objective of this study was to elucidate the role of Sema3E/plexinD1 in postnatal angiogenesis.\nSema3E inhibited cell growth and tube formation by suppressing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Expression of Sema3E and plexinD1 was markedly upregulated in ischemic limbs of mice (2.5- and 4.5-fold increase for Sema3E and plexinD1, respectively), and inhibition of this pathway by introduction of the plexinD1-Fc gene or disruption of Sema3E led to a significant increase of blood flow recovery (1.6- and 1.5-fold increase for the plexinD1-Fc gene treatment and Sema3E disruption, respectively). Hypoxia activated the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby upregulating Sema3E expression. Expression of p53 and Sema3E was enhanced in diabetic mice compared with normal mice (2- and 1.3-fold increase for p53 and Sema3E, respectively). Consequently, neovascularization after VEGF treatment was poor in the ischemic tissues of diabetic mice, whereas treatment with VEGF plus plexinD1-Fc markedly improved neovascularization.\nThese results indicate that inhibition of Sema3E may be a novel strategy for therapeutic angiogenesis, especially when VEGF is ineffective.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2009-11-27", "authors": ["JunjiMoriya", "TohruMinamino", "KaoruTateno", "ShoOkada", "AkiyoshiUemura", "IppeiShimizu", "MasatakaYokoyama", "AikaNojima", "MitsuhiroOkada", "HisashiKoga", "IsseiKomuro"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.210815"}
{"title": "Differential effects of hypoxia on osteochondrogenic potential of human adipose-derived stem cells.", "abstract": "Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hATSC) have been contemplated as reparative cells for cartilage engineering. Chondrogenic differentiation of hATSC can be induced by an enriched culture medium and a three-dimensional environment. Given that bone is vascularized and cartilage is not, oxygen tension has been suggested as a regulatory factor for osteochondrogenic differentiation. Our work aimed at determining whether hypoxia affects the osteochondrogenic potential of hATSC. hATSC were cultured in chondrogenic or osteogenic medium for 28 days, in pellets or monolayers, and under 5% or 20% oxygen tension. Cell differentiation was monitored by real-time PCR (COL2A1, aggrecan, Runx2, and osteocalcin). The chondrogenic differentiation was further evaluated by Alcian blue and immunohistological staining for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and type II collagen, respectively. Osteogenic differentiation was also assessed by the staining of mineralized matrix (Alizarin Red) and measurement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The expression of chondrogenic markers was upregulated when hATSC were exposed to hypoxia in chondrogenic medium. Conversely, osteocalcin expression, mineralization, and ALP activity were severely reduced under hypoxic conditions even in the presence of osteogenic medium. Our data strongly suggest that hypoxia favors the chondrogenic differentiation of hATSC as evidenced by the expression of the chondrogenic markers, whereas it could alter their osteogenic potential. Our results highlight the differential regulatory role of hypoxia on the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation processes of hATSC.

{"title": "Comparison of the vascularity of fasciocutaneous tissue and muscle for coverage of open tibial fractures.", "abstract": "Early coverage with vascularized soft-tissue flaps has dramatically improved the outcome in open tibial fractures. However, the ideal tissue for covering open fractures remains controversial. Several clinical studies suggest that muscle is superior to fasciocutaneous tissue; this is attributed to the presumed higher vascularity of muscle, although experimental evidence is inconclusive. The authors' previously described novel murine fracture model, which allows exclusive comparison of both tissues, demonstrated enhanced healing beneath muscle. The present study was undertaken to compare the vascularity of muscle and fasciocutaneous tissues over the course of fracture healing.\nTwo experimental groups comprised mice with tibial fractures in contact with either muscle or fasciocutaneous tissues exclusively. Controls included a nontrauma group and those where soft tissues and periosteum were dissected but the tibia was not fractured. Animals were harvested between 3 and 28 days after fracture (n = 170 in total). The vascular density of the soft tissues was assessed using immunohistochemical techniques.\nFasciocutaneous tissue was found to have a higher vascular density compared with muscle in contact with the fracture site at all time points (p < 0.0001, two-way analysis of variance), despite accelerated healing of fractures covered by muscle.\nThe authors' data show that the more advanced healing of fractures covered by muscle compared with fasciocutaneous tissue is not related to the vascularity of the tissues, as the latter had a higher vascular density at all time points. Therefore, provided that a flap has sufficient vascularity to effectively reconstitute the soft-tissue envelope, other factors may be important in specifically promoting fracture healing.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2009-11-26", "authors": ["Lorraine EHarry", "AnnSandison", "Michael FPearse", "Ewa MPaleolog", "JagdeepNanchahal"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181b5a308"}

Numerous models have been described for the production of adipose tissue with success in the short term, but little has been reported on the stability of this tissue-engineered fat beyond 4 months.\nA murine model of de novo adipogenesis producing a potentially transplantable adipose tissue flap within 4 to 6 weeks was developed in the authors' laboratory. In this study, the authors assess the ability of three-chamber (44-microl volume) configurations shown to be adipogenic in previous short-term studies (autograft, n = 8; open, n = 6; fat flap, n = 11) to maintain their tissue volume for up to 12 months in vivo, to determine the most adipogenic configuration in the long term.\nThose chambers having the most contact with existing vascularized adipose tissue (open and fat flap groups) showed increased mean adipose tissue percentage (77 +/- 5.6 percent and 81 +/- 6.9 percent, respectively; p < 0.0007) and volume (12 +/- 6.8 microl and 30 +/- 14 microl, respectively; p < 0.025) when compared with short-term controls and greater adipose tissue volume than the autograft (sealed) chamber group (4.9 +/- 5.8 microl; p = 0.0001) at 1 year. Inclusion of a vascularized fat flap within the chamber produced the best results, with new fat completely filling the chamber by 1 year.\nThese findings demonstrate that fat produced by tissue engineering is capable of maintaining its volume when the appropriate microenvironment is provided.

Nineteen of these patients underwent surgery for the removal of the hemangiomas, whereas 9 patients were not operated on.

Light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used for the observation of all microanatomical details. All patients were studied for a clinical diagnosis, and many were subjected to surgical therapy.\nThe morphological results revealed numerous microanatomical characteristics of the hemangiomatous vessels. The observation by light microscopy shows the afferent and the efferent vessels for every microhemangioma. All the layers of the arterial wall are uneven. The lumen of the arteriole is entirely used by a blood clot. The observation by transmission electron microscopy shows that it was impossible to see the limits of the different layers (endothelium, medial layer, and adventitia) in the whole wall of the vessels. Moreover, both the muscular and elastic components are disarranged and replaced with connective tissue. The observation by scanning electron microscopy shows that the corrosion cast of the hemangioma offers 3 periods of filling: initially with partial filling of the arteriolar and of the whole cast, intermediate with the entire filling of the whole cast (including arteriole and venule), and a last period with a partial emptying of the arteriolar and whole cast while the venule remains totally injected with resin.\nOur morphological results can be useful to clinicians for a precise diagnosis on the aftereffects of hemangiomas.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2009-11-26", "authors": ["CarloCavallotti", "ChiaraCavallotti", "FilippoGiovannetti", "GiorgioIannetti"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181bf85d7"}

This can be achieved by the procedure described by Dunn. However, all published studies report a risk of avascular necrosis.\nThe present series assembles 25 adolescent cases aged 10 to 15 years. There were 16 cases of chronic pure displacement with several months' evolution, including nine exacerbated by an acute accident. In all cases, epiphyseal slippage was severe, between 60 degrees and 90 degrees. Postoperative traction was systematic, for 15 to 21 days. As of 1979, bone scan was prescribed 2 weeks postsurgery to study femoral head vascularization.\nReduction was anatomic, except in two cases in which the epiphysis was fixed, respectively in caput valgum and in 15 degrees varus. There were 15 good results, with clinically and radiologically normal hips, but also 10 immediate or late complications: i.e., a complications rate of 40%. The eight immediate complications (32%) comprised four necroses (16%), two of which rapidly evolved into arthritis, three chondrolyses, which all evolved into arthritis, and one mechanical complication. At less than 10 years' FU, two arthrodeses and three hip replacements were required. At long-term FU, there were two further late deteriorations, despite initial favorable clinical and X-ray outcomes.\nIn theory, the procedure described by Dunn limits the vascular risk of the displacement correction. It does, however, involve certain tricky technical points: trochanterotomy may be excessive or insufficient; posterior cervical periosteal detachment may be aggressive; and the periosteum may be too tight during the reduction. In all series studying Dunn's operation, such risk of necrotic complication is reported, at rates up to 17%.

The hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are key mediators of the response to low oxygen.

The Pubmed database was consulted for identification of the most relevant published articles. Search terms used were oxygen, placenta, trophoblast, pregnancy, HIF and hypoxia. The HIFs are able to function throughout all aspects of normal and abnormal placental differentiation, growth and function; during the first trimester (physiologically low oxygen), during mid-late gestation (where there is adequate supply of blood and oxygen to the placenta) and in pathological pregnancies complicated by placental hypoxia/ischemia. During normal pregnancy HIFs may respond to complex alterations in oxygen, hormones, cytokines and growth factors to regulate placental invasion, differentiation, transport and vascularization. In the ever-changing environment created during pregnancy, the HIFs appear to act as key mediators of placental development and function and thereby are likely to be important contributors to both normal and adverse pregnancy outcomes.", "journal": "Human reproduction update", "date": "2009-11-21", "authors": ["K GPringle", "K LKind", "A NSferruzzi-Perri", "J GThompson", "C TRoberts"], "doi": "10.1093/humupd/dmp046"}

CR is a progressive disease, characterized by deteriorating graft function, interstitial fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and occlusive neointima development. TGFbeta, known for its immunosuppressive qualities, plays a beneficial role in the transplant setting by maintaining alloreactive T cells in a hyporesponsive state, but has also been implicated in promoting graft fibrosis and CR. In the mouse vascularized cardiac allograft model, transient depletion of CD4(+) cells promotes graft survival but leads to CR, which is associated with intragraft TGFbeta expression. Decorin, an extracellular matrix protein, inhibits both TGFbeta bioactivity and gene expression. In this study, gene transfer of decorin into cardiac allografts was used to assess the impact of intragraft TGFbeta neutralization on CR, systemic donor-reactive T cell responses, and allograft acceptance. Decorin gene transfer and neutralization of TGFbeta in cardiac allografts significantly attenuated interstitial fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and improved graft function, but did not result in systemic donor-reactive T cell responses. Thus, donor-reactive T and B cells remained in a hyporesponsive state.

We previously reported that the angiogenic growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) coaxes monocytes to assume the phenotype of functional endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study we show that PTN expression is colocalized with capillaries of human atherosclerotic plaques. Among the various reagents that are critical to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, interferon (IFN)-gamma was found to markedly induce PTN mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in macrophages. Mechanistic studies revealed that the Janus kinase inhibitors, WHI-P154 and ATA, efficiently blocked STAT1 phosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Notably, the level of phosphorylated STAT1 was found to correlate directly with the PTN mRNA levels. In addition, STAT1/STAT3/p44/42 signaling molecules were found to be phosphorylated by IFN-gamma in macrophages, and they were translocated into the nucleus. Further, PTN promoter analysis showed that a gamma-activated sequence (GAS) located at -2086 to -2078 bp is essential for IFN-gamma-regulated promoter activity. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift, supershift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that both STAT1 and STAT3 bind to the GAS at the chromatin level in the IFN-gamma stimulated cells. Finally, to test whether the combined effect of STAT1/STAT3/p44/42 signaling is required for the expression of PTN in macrophages, gene knockdowns of these transcription factors were performed using siRNA. Cells lacking STAT1, but not STAT3 or p42, have markedly reduced PTN mRNA levels.

Sixty endometrioses from different sites (ovarian, uterine, and peritoneal) were evaluated immunohistochemically for COX-2 expression. Cyclooxygenase-2 staining of 75% or more of the cells was defined as COX-2 overexpression and used as cutoff. Proliferative activity was determined by performing Ki-67-labeling index. Periendometriotic vascularization was evaluated by determining microvessel density surrounding the endometriotic focus using CD-34-immunostaining. Cyclooxygenase-2 overexpression was significant more frequent in ovarian endometriosis, when compared with uterine and peritoneal localization (70.8% versus 41.7%; P = .027). There was no significant correlation between COX-2 overexpression and perifocal neovascularization (P = .49).

Pigs' vasculature in the skin is anatomically and physiologically similar to human, making it an ideal model for research. Until now, most vascular imaging studies are of two-dimensions. The aim of this study is to provide a three-dimensional (3D) model that reveals detailed architecture of the vascular network of the porcine, for accurate quantitative assessment.\nFive Guangxi Bama minipigs were anaesthetized intramuscularly and underwent whole body lead oxide-gelatin injection. Spiral computed tomography scanning was performed on the subjects and three-dimensional reconstructions were made. Another minipig was used, and underwent Cardiografin injection. 3D-reconstruction was executed in vivo. All subjects were then dissected by layers to document the individual perforators.\nAngiography using perfusion with lead oxide-gelatine mixture has the advantage of illustrating distinctively the vessels and their perforating branches. However, it is incapable of displaying other tissues structures. Angiography through perfusion with Cardiografin in vivo has the advantage of demonstrating the relationship between arteries and bones. Yet it could only display coarsely the vascular trunk, and is incapable of displaying the vascular network. By combining these two methods, the 3D structure, source, course, and territories of the arteries were presented distinctively.\n3D modeling in combination with traditional sectional imaging of the pig model enables blood vessels to be displayed more dynamically with greater realism.

Whilst the disease is now being diagnosed earlier, determining patient prognosis remains a challenge. Current prognostic indicators, such as TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, and RCC subtype, are inadequate. Unlike several other malignancies, RCC lacks a biomarker that can stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk for developing metastases. Additionally, antiangiogenic therapy is currently offered to patients with metastatic disease, however, a biomarker to monitor treatment efficacy is lacking. Recent attention has focused on surrogate markers of tumor vascularization as a source of prognostic biomarkers, as tumor growth is ultimately dependent on neovascularization. Two cell populations of interest, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs), have been demonstrated across several studies to contribute to tumor vascularization. Given these findings, studies have examined their utility as biomarkers of prognosis by correlating their levels with progression-free survival and prognostic determinants such as tumor volume and weight.

However, to facilitate systemic application it would be useful to improve tumor targeting and antitumor efficacy further. Here we report the generation of vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig, a targeted and armed oncolytic vaccinia virus. Tumor targeting was achieved by deletion of genes for thymidine kinase and vaccinia virus growth factor, which are necessary for replication in normal but not in cancer cells. Given the high vascularization typical of kidney cancers, we armed the virus with the soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 protein for an antiangiogenic effect. Systemic application of high doses of vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig resulted in cytokine induction in an immunocompromised mouse model. Upon histopathological analysis, splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis was seen in all virus-injected mice and was more pronounced in the vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig group. Analysis of the innate immune response after intravenous virus injection revealed high transient and dose-dependent cytokine elevations. When medium and low doses were used for intratumoral or intravenous injection, vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig exhibited a stronger antitumor effect than the unarmed control. Furthermore, expression of VEGFR-1-Ig was confirmed, and a concurrent antiangiogenic effect was seen. In an immunocompetent model, systemic vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig exhibited superior antitumor efficacy compared to the unarmed control virus.

Although it is generally believed that all Ihh functions are mediated by the Gli family of transcription activators and repressors, formal genetic proof for this notion has not been provided. Moreover, the extent to which different Gli proteins contribute to Ihh functions is not fully understood. Previous work has shown that de-repression of the Gli3 repressor is the predominant mode through which Ihh controls chondrocyte proliferation and maturation, but that osteoblast differentiation and hypertrophic cartilage vascularization require additional mechanisms. To test the involvement of Gli2 activation in these processes, we have generated a mouse strain that expresses a constitutive Gli2 activator in a Cre-dependent manner, and have attempted to rescue the Ihh-null mouse with the Gli2 activator, either alone or in combination with Gli3 removal. Here, we report that the Gli2 activator alone is sufficient to induce vascularization of the hypertrophic cartilage in the absence of Ihh but requires simultaneous removal of Gli3 to restore osteoblast differentiation. These results therefore provide direct genetic evidence that Gli2 and Gli3 collectively mediate all major aspects of Ihh function during endochondral skeletal development.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2009-11-13", "authors": ["Kyu SangJoeng", "FanxinLong"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.041624"}

Importantly, a profile consisting of a high VEGF concentration initially, followed by a decreasing concentration over time was found to yield optimal angiogenic sprouting. A total VEGF dose 0.1 microg/g, when delivered with kinetics found to be optimal in vitro, provided a favorable therapeutic dose in murine hindlimb ischemia model, and distributing this VEGF dose in two spatial locations induces a higher level of vascularization and perfusion than a single location.

This study has investigated how HIF and VEGF protein levels relate to each other with regard to vascularization, tumor stage, and overall survival in neuroblastoma.\nTissue cores taken from tumor specimens representing 93 children with neuroblastoma were arranged on a microarray and stained for HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, VEGF, and CD31 proteins. Both fraction of positive cells and staining intensity were evaluated and protein levels were correlated with each other and with clinical variables.\nAlthough high levels of both HIF-1alpha (P < 0.001) and HIF-2alpha (P < 0.001) correlated positively to VEGF expression, they did not fully correlate with each other. Moreover, HIF-1alpha (P = 0.002) and VEGF (P < 0.001), but not HIF-2alpha, correlated negatively to vascularization as determined by CD31 staining abundance. VEGF expression or degree of vascularization did not correlate with tumor stage or overall survival. High HIF-1alpha levels correlated with low tumor stage (P < 0.001) and were associated with a favorable patient prognosis (P = 0.08).\nThe discordant results on expression of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha suggest that these two proteins are differentially regulated in vivo, thus reflecting distinctive protein expression/stabilization mechanisms.

The co-administration group had higher toughness and ultimate strength than the ovariectomized controls (P<0.01). E+R had better biomechanical properties than the single treatments; yet the differences were not significant. Uterus histology signified high degeneration in the estrogen group. The raloxifene group had less degeneration but higher vascularization. Less immune reaction and vascularization were observed in the group with combined dosage than in those with individual treatments. Hence, the uterus of the combined treatment had fewer side effects than the ones that were individually treated.

Heparan sulfate-bound polypeptides include inflammatory mediators, chemokines, angiogenic factors, morphogens, and growth-promoting factors that induce cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation in wound healing. OTR4120, a polymer engineered to mimic the properties of HS-GAGs, is used to replace the natural HS-GAGs that are degraded during wound repair, and enhance the tissue regeneration by preserving the cellular microenvironment and the endogenous signals needed for tissue regeneration. We previously demonstrated that OTR4120 treatment had a long-term effect on increasing breaking strength and vasodilation in healing rat full-thickness excisional wounds. The present study investigates the underlying mechanisms of the effects of OTR4120 treatment in improving the quality of cutaneous wound repair. We found that OTR4120 treatment stimulated inflammation resolution and increased neovascularization. OTR4120 treatment also promoted epidermal migration and proliferation during reepithelialization. Moreover, the granulation tissue formation and collagen maturation were improved in OTR4120-treated wounds. Three months after wounding, the effects of OTR4120 treatment on vascularization and inflammation resolution were normalized, except for an improved neodermis.

However, none of these techniques are accepted universally because of the technical difficulties, complications, or mixed results that often are difficult to reproduce.\nWe describe a technique using vascularized bone grafting for treating ONFH in Stages II-IV (Ficat and Arlet) disease, describe our indications, and report the survival of this technique and the functional scores.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 191 patients (195 hips) who underwent vascularized greater trochanter grafting for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (Ficat and Arlet Stages II-IV) from 1995 to 2006. The mean age of the patients was 44 years (range, 19-59 years). The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 8 years; range, 2-11 years).\nTwenty patients (23 hips) had conversion surgery to THA. The mean Harris hip scores for the patients who did not have conversion surgery to THA improved from 53 to 88 points. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no difference in the 11-year survival rate between patients with Stage II and Stage III disease (THA as an end point). However, the survival rate was lower for patients with Stage IV disease compared with patients with Stages II and III disease. The survival rate for patients in the steroid group was lower compared with the rates for patients in the idiopathic, alcoholic, trauma, and hyperlipidemia groups. At last followup, the stage of necrosis remained unchanged in 118 hips.\nWe believe vascularized greater trochanter bone grafting is appropriate for young selected patients with mild to moderate collapse of the femoral head.\nLevel IV, therapeutic study.

Variations in vascular density, total length of the vascular network and mean diameter of vascular network branches were determined by image analysis (Aphelion software).\nA decrease was observed in both vascular density and total length of the network in control and treated groups (time effect). No difference in variation in vascular density was observed between the PSS group and the Z120 group at any time point (p=NS). A trend to a higher decrease in vascular density was noted between D12 and D15 in the Z400 group.

An in vivo xenograft model was evaluated to verify its potential for fibroblast-related functional studies.\nIn situ: Fiftytwo G2/G3 colon tumours were histomorphologically categorised into low (<50%), medium (50-75%) and high (>75%) grade desmoplasia based on hematoxylin/eosin and Elastica van Gieson stained paraffin sections. Low and high grade desmoplastic tumours were identified and stained for endothelial and pericyte markers to morphometrically analyse microvessel count (MVC), vascular surface area (VSA) and vascular maturation status. In vivo: One out of three established subcutaneous xenograft model in NMRI (nu/nu) mice was adapted to monitor the impact of primary human fibroblasts on xenograft formation and morphology.\nVascular structures in human colon tumours are predominantly located in the fibroblastic stromal regions. Highly desmoplastic tumours, however, have significantly lower MVC and VSA values at the invasion front with signs for augmented vascular maturation as compared with low grade desmoplastic colon cancers. Our in vivo approach verified that only high proportions of co-injected normal fibroblasts accelerate xenograft formation of HCT-116 colon cancer cells.\nThe in situ data clearly support the hypothesis of fibroblasts to contribute to vascular maturation phenomena in colon cancers. The in vivo design of only 500 tumour cells co-injected with normal fibroblast is feasible, results in 100% engraftment and is the basis for further developments.", "journal": "International journal of radiation biology", "date": "2009-11-10", "authors": ["Stephan ASchmid", "AntjeDietrich", "StephanieSchulte", "AndreasGaumann", "Leoni AKunz-Schughart"], "doi": "10.3109/09553000903258897"}

Current imaging techniques are limited in sensitivity and specificity in detecting early stage ovarian cancer prior to its widespread metastasis. New imaging techniques that can provide functional and molecular contrasts are needed to reduce the high mortality of this disease. One such promising technique is photoacoustic imaging. We develop a 1280-element coregistered 3-D ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system based on a 1.75-D acoustic array. Volumetric images over a scan range of 80 deg in azimuth and 20 deg in elevation can be achieved in minutes. The system has been used to image normal porcine ovarian tissue. This is an important step toward better understanding of ovarian cancer optical properties obtained with photoacoustic techniques. To the best of our knowledge, such data are not available in the literature. We present characterization measurements of the system and compare coregistered ultrasound and photoacoustic images of ovarian tissue to histological images.

{"title": "Angiostatic factors normally restrict islet endothelial cell proliferation and migration: implications for islet transplantation.", "abstract": "New blood vessel formation in transplanted islets occurs within 7-14 days post-transplantation through both the expansion of donor islet endothelium and ingrowth of blood vessels from the implantation organ. However, several studies indicate that although the islets attract recipient blood vessels, the formed intra-islet vascular network is insufficient, which affects islet post-transplant function. This study aimed to develop an in vitro model to investigate the migration and proliferation properties of isolated liver and islet endothelium.Rat islet or liver endothelium was purified using Bandeiraea simplicifolia(BS-1)-coated Dynabeads. The liver endothelium displayed an increased migration and proliferation to islet-conditioned medium. These effects were fully prevented by adding a neutralizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-antibody. In contrast, islet-produced VEGF failed to induce islet endothelial cell migration and only had marginal effects on islet endothelial cell proliferation.These properties could, however, be activated through blocking the effects of either endostatin, thrombospondin-1 or alpha(1)-antitrypsin. In conclusion, VEGF may attract recipient blood vessels towards intrahepatically transplanted islets,but intra-islet vascular expansion is hampered by angiostatic factors present within the islets and the islet endothelium.

The interconnected pores, large enough to ensure an adequate vascularization and new tissue ingrowth, can be obtained by pouring a slurry containing a biodegradable thermogel (such as agarose and gellan) and a ceramic into a mold consisting of a three-dimensional network of rigid filaments. Additional pore distributions in the macropore region can be tailored as a function of the drying/preservation technology (10-100 microm) or the interaction between the inorganic particles coated by the polymeric components (0.1-1 microm). Moreover, porosity in the mesopore range can be created by shaping ceramics such as mesoporous silica or nanocrystalline carbonatehydroxyapatite. In addition to the various bioceramics that have been successfully shaped, this method is flexible enough to allow the introduction of certain substances whose controlled release may help to avoid some negative effects that usually appear with the implantation of a material, i.e. infection, inflammation, etc., or to simplify some of the many steps required for the successful integration of a graft.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2009-11-06", "authors": ["JuanPe\u00f1a", "Jes\u00fasRom\u00e1n", "MVictoria Caba\u00f1as", "Mar\u00edaVallet-Reg\u00ed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2009.10.049"}

The expression of HIF-1 increases vascularization of the ischaemic area and regulates anaerobic metabolism. The same processes were observed in neoplastic tissues.

Cancer and metastasis involve numerous biological steps, including angiogenesis in both the primary and metastatic sites. Although various molecules that are involved in both tumor neovascularization (angiogenesis) and invasion have been identified, little is known about how these molecules interact in cancerous microenvironments. We previously reported that the gene expressions of some factors associated with vascularization correlated with the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we performed multivariate analysis of the mRNA levels of 10 selected genes [VEGF-A, VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, S100A4, E-cadherin, Thrombospondin (TSP)-1, TSP-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9] in 130 NSCLC specimens using the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Spearman's rank correlation test was used to determine the co-expression patterns. The analysis demonstrated highly significant co-expressions (P<0.0001) among the VEGF isoforms (VEGF-A, VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189). We also analyzed the correlations among the prognosis, gene expressions, clinical factors (age and gender), and pathological features (histological types, TNM status, stages, lymphatic involvement, and venous involvement) using the Cox proportional hazards model. Multivariate analyses showed that only VEGF189 expression was an independent prognostic indicator (P=0.0252).

Several studies have confirmed the existence of EPCs, as well as their bone marrow origin and their ability to integrate into vascular structures at sites of neoangiogenesis. EPCs appear to be naturally involved in the prevention of ischemia by participating directly in the vascularization process. Given their tropism for sites of neoangiogenesis, EPCs have clear therapeutic potential for treating ischemic diseases. If associated with other cell therapy products, they could improve tissue regeneration by promoting graft vascularization. However, the use of EPCs as a cell therapy product is limited by their rarity in peripheral blood. Cord blood contains many more EPCs, which are functional and can be expanded in culture. Their clinical use will require expansion in strictly controlled conditions and rigorous validation in preclinical models.

In the ovary, angiogenesis is known to occur after ovulation in the developing corpus luteum (CL) in mammals. To determine whether HIF1 participates in angiogenesis in bovine CL, the present study investigated the mRNA and protein expressions of the HIF1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) and VEGF in bovine CL during the estrous cycle. The effects of hypoxia on the expressions of HIF1A protein, VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein in bovine luteal cells were also examined by using a cell culture system. HIF1A mRNA expression was less at the regressed stage than at the other stages, whereas protein expression of HIF1A was highest at the early luteal stage and decreased thereafter. VEGF mRNA expression was highest at the developing luteal stage and decreased thereafter. VEGF protein expression was highest at the early luteal stage and decreased significantly at the regressed luteal stage. Hypoxia increased the amounts of HIF1A protein, VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein in cultured bovine luteal cells. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia inhibited progesterone production in the mid luteal cells, but not in the early luteal cells. The overall findings indicate that HIF1 is one of the factors promoting VEGF-induced angiogenesis during luteal development, and suggest that the hypoxic conditions formed after follicle rupture contribute to establishing luteal vascularization in cattle.", "journal": "The Journal of reproduction and development", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["RyoNishimura", "KiyoshiOkuda"], "doi": "10.1262/jrd.09-162e"}

Examination by X-ray and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), histologic analysis, and biomechanical tests were used to evaluate repair and the vascularization of the implants. The results showed that by co-seeding MSCs and MSC-derived ECs, the resulting vascularization was able to promote osteogenesis and improve mechanical properties. The rabbits treated with vascularized tissue engineered bone exhibited far more extensive osteogenesis and good vascularization.

CS was a better implantable hemostatic material than gelatin sponge (GS) or oxidized cellulose (OC) in both the acute and chronic bleeding models. The better efficacy of CS may be due to its greater ability to enhance platelet activation, erythrocyte aggregation and morphological alteration, and thrombin generation at sites it is applied than GS or OC. Moreover, preliminary safety evaluations have demonstrated excellent blood and cell compatibility in hemorheological measurements, blood coagulation analysis, histological evaluations and hepatocytes culture experiments. None of CS, GS, or OC induced acute inflammation or other adverse effects while normal tissue growth and vascularization were observed in each case 4 weeks after each hemostatic agent had been implanted.

{"title": "CLU and colon cancer. The dual face of CLU: from normal to malignant phenotype.", "abstract": "The transition from normal to malignant phenotype implies the activation of some pathways that underlie the aberrant clone expansion. In some way, the conventional function of proteins involved in DNA repair, cell death/growth induction, vascularization, and metabolism is inhibited or shifted toward other pathways by soluble mediators that orchestrate such change depending on the microenvironment conditions. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence of the colon represents one of the most well studied and characterized models of human tumor progression. In this section, we focus our attention on defined pathways that underlie the initiation, promotion, and progression of colon cancer, conferring aggressiveness to the neoplastic cells. Clusterin (CLU) is a pleiotropic protein with a broad range of functions. It has recently drawn much attention because of its association with cancer promotion and metastasis. It is involved in prosurvival and apoptosis processes that are carried out by two different forms. sCLU is cytoprotective and its prosurvival function is the basis of the current Phase I/II clinical trials. In colorectal cancer an increase of sCLU expression occurs, whereas the nuclear proapoptotic form is downregulated. Several controversial data have been published on colon cancer discussing its role as tumor suppressor or prosurvival factor in colon cancer. Here, we report the dynamic interaction of the different forms of CLU with their partners DNA-repair protein Ku70 and proapoptotic factor Bax during colon cancer progression, which seems to be a crucial point for the neoplastic cell fate. We also highlight that the appearance and the progressive increase of the sCLU in colorectal tumors correlate to a significant increase of CLU in serum and stool of patients. On the basis of results obtained by CLU immuno-dosage in blood and stool of colon cancer patients, we report that sCLU could represent a diagnostic molecular marker for colon cancer screening.", "journal": "Advances in cancer research", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["PMazzarelli", "SabinaPucci", "L GSpagnoli"], "doi": "10.1016/S0065-230X(09)05003-9"}

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment of EBs showed the best induction, with markedly increased expression of endothelial cell proteins CD31, VE-Cadherin, and von Willebrand Factor, but not the hematopoietic cell marker CD45.

Continuous VEGF treatment resulted in a 4- to 5-fold enrichment of CD31(+) cells but did not increase endothelial proliferation rates, suggesting a primary effect on differentiation. CD31(+) cells purified from differentiating EBs upregulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in response to TNFalpha, confirming their ability to function as endothelial cells. These cells also expressed multiple endothelial genes and formed lumenized vessels when seeded onto porous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) scaffolds and implanted in vivo subcutaneously in athymic rats.

The purpose of this study was to assess the anatomical feasibility of revascularization of the ICA giving rise to the AA using the IMA. Twenty-four dissections were carried out on 12 cadavers (eight men, four women) with a mean age of 76 at the time of death. Preparation consisted of intra-arterial injection of polymethylsiloxane (Rhodorsil, Rhodia, France). For each IMA, the following parameters were determined: diameter in relation to the ICA in the paravertebral region before division, length, and level of the intercostal space in which direct anastomosis was possible. Dissection showed that the mean diameter at the end of the IMA was 1.8mm (range 1.2-2.4). The mean diameter of the ICA in the paravertebral region was compatible with that of the IMA, i.e., 1.6mm (range 0.9-2.5). The mean length of the IMA was 185 mm (range 165-230). The lowest intercostal space available in the paravertebral region for direct anastomosis between the IMA and ICA was the seventh space in one case, the eighth in 12, the ninth in eight, and the tenth in three.

The diameters of BAs responsible for bleeding and receiving BAE were apparently larger in each measured segment than those that were not (p < 0.05). Moreover, the diameters of arteries receiving BAE remained largely unchanged from the origin to the hilum and through the mediastinum. BAs with low MDCT scores were significantly less likely to required BAE than those with high scores (p = 0.004), and in multiple logistic regression analysis, ostium diameter and bleeding status were independent predictive factors for BAE.\nEvaluation of BAs on MDCT could be useful for identifying the anatomical characteristics of bleeding-related BAs and determining whether BAE is indicated or whether conservative treatment is sufficient.", "journal": "Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases", "date": "2009-10-30", "authors": ["HidenoriMori", "YasushiOhno", "YusukeTsuge", "MasanoriKawasaki", "FumitakaIto", "JunkiEndo", "NorihikoFunaguchi", "Bu Lin BaiLa", "MasayukiKanematsu", "ShinyaMinatoguchi"], "doi": "10.1159/000253882"}

{"title": "Stimulatory effects of thyroid hormone on brain angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro.", "abstract": "Thyroid hormone is critical for the proper development of the central nervous system. However, the specific role of thyroid hormone on brain angiogenesis remains poorly understood. Treatment of rats from birth to postnatal day 21 (P21) with propylthiouracil (PTU), a reversible blocker of triiodothyronine (T3) synthesis, resulted in decreased brain angiogenesis, as indicated by reduced complexity and density of microvessels. However, when PTU was withdrawn at P22, these parameters were fully recovered by P90. These changes were paralleled by an altered expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and basic fibroblast growth factor (Fgf2). Physiologic concentrations of T3 and thyroxine (T4) stimulated proliferation and tubulogenesis of rat brain-derived endothelial (RBE4) cells in vitro. Protein and mRNA levels of VEGF-A and FGF-2 increased after T3 stimulation of RBE4 cells. The thyroid hormone receptor blocker NH-3 abolished T3-induced Fgf2 and Vegfa upregulation, indicating a receptor-mediated effect. Thyroid hormone inhibited the apoptosis in RBE4 cells and altered mRNA levels of apoptosis-related genes, namely Bcl2 and Bad. The present results show that thyroid hormone has a substantial impact on vasculature development in the brain.

Because human malignant cell lines metastasize more readily from orthotopic sites than from heterotopic sites, to identify metastasis-permissive tumor microenvironments, we used noninvasive imaging to compare the in vivo vascular, metabolic, and physiologic characteristics of a human prostate cancer xenograft implanted orthotopically in the prostate or s.c. in the flank. Hypoxia was detected in these xenografts by placing an enhanced green fluorescence protein optical reporter under the control of a hypoxia response element. A multiparametric analysis of hypoxia, extracellular pH, vascularization, and metabolism provided a characterization of environments that are permissive for metastasis to occur. We found that orthotopic tumors, which metastasized more easily, were characterized by higher vascular volume, permeability, and total choline and a more acidic extracellular pH. Interestingly, metastatic deposits in the lymph nodes as well as cancer cells in ascites fluid were found to be hypoxic, explaining, in part, the refractory nature of metastatic disease.

The shape and dimensions of the lymph nodes were assessed with B-mode ultrasonography; their vascularization pattern with power Doppler sonography and with color Doppler spectral analysis. Vascular pattern was evaluated according to the vascularization of the lymph node. Vascular resistive index and pulsatility index were assessed by at least three flow samplings. We measured resistive index, pulsatility index, peak systolic velocity, and end diastolic velocity. Results of Doppler analysis were compared with clinical findings and histopathologic results. Nodes were grouped as metastasis, lymphoma, tuberculosis, and reactive benign lymphadenopathies with respect to ultrasonographic results.\nForty-four of 69 lymph nodes were found to be malignant histopathologically. In color Doppler analysis, most malign metastatic lymphadenopathies showed peripheral (76.4%), and the rest of them (23.6%) showed peripheral and hilar (mix) vascularization. Most benign lymphadenopathies (88%) and lymphomatous lymphadenopathies (85%) had hilar vascularization. In tuberculous lymphadenopathies, 50% of them showed avascular pattern and the rest of them had variable type of vascularization. A resistive index = or > 0.7 indicated a malignant metastatic lymphadenopathy and a resistive index <0.5 was consistent with benign lesions.

{"title": "Gallery of uncommon orthopedic implants: a guide for emergency radiologist.", "abstract": "The purpose of this gallery of orthopedic implants was to provide a reference for emergency radiologists to quickly identify uncommon devices in the shoulders, hips, and extremities. The cases presented in this exhibit will include unusual arthroplasties and prostheses as well as bone graft implants (including allograft and autograft). Bone grafts are frequently used for the treatment of bone defects, which may be caused by trauma, infection, or avascularity. Autogenous cancellous, corticocancellous, or cortical bone grafts are often used, either free or vascularized. Alternative bone graft substitutes are also used. An obvious complication of bone grafts is the failure of incorporation. Joint arthroplasty is the most frequently performed orthopedic procedure after fracture fixation. Major indications include degenerative joint disease, inflammatory arthropathy, avascular necrosis, and complicated fractures. Custom orthopedic implants are frequently used for less common indications or for patients with bone tumors. The common hardware complications are infections, loosening, small particle disease/osteolysis, periprosthetic fracture, hardware fracture or dislocation, and recurrent disease, especially in patients with tumors. Many of the devices used by orthopedic surgeons are infrequently seen in everyday radiology practice. With such variations, correct recognition of the prosthetic devices and their complications is very important. The goal of this exhibit was to familiarize the radiologist with both the normal and abnormal appearance of many atypical orthopedic implants. It is important to understand the purpose and proper function of a device, but not necessarily important to describe every device by its proper brand name.

{"title": "Glycome and transcriptome regulation of vasculogenesis.", "abstract": "Therapeutic vasculogenesis is an emerging concept that can potentially be harnessed for the management of ischemic pathologies. The present study elucidates the potential coregulation of vasculogenesis by the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan-rich cell-surface glycome and the transcriptome.\nDifferentiation of embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells in an in vitro embryoid body is paralleled by an amplification of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan sulfation, which correlates with the levels of the enzyme N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 (NDST1). Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of NDST1 or modification of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans in embryonic stem cells with heparinases or sodium chlorate inhibited differentiation of embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells. This was translated to an in vivo zebrafish embryo model, in which the genetic knockdown of NDST1 resulted in impaired vascularization characterized by a concentration-dependent decrease in intersegmental vessel lumen and a large tail-vessel configuration, which could be rescued by use of exogenous sulfated heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. To explore the cross talk between the glycome and the transcriptome during vasculogenesis, we identified by microarray and then validated wild-type and NDST1 knockdown-associated gene-expression patterns in zebrafish embryos. Temporal analysis at 3 developmental stages critical for vasculogenesis revealed a cascade of pathways that may mediate glycocalyx regulation of vasculogenesis. These pathways were intimately connected to cell signaling, cell survival, and cell fate determination. Specifically, we demonstrated that forkhead box O3A/5 proteins and insulin-like growth factor were key downstream signals in this process.\nThe present study for the first time implicates interplay between the glycome and the transcriptome during vasculogenesis, revealing the possibility of harnessing specific cellular glyco-microenvironments for therapeutic vascularization.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2009-10-28", "authors": ["RaniaHarfouche", "Dirk MHentschel", "StephaniePiecewicz", "SudiptaBasu", "CristinPrint", "DavidEavarone", "TanyelKiziltepe", "RamSasisekharan", "ShiladityaSengupta"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.837724"}

Thus, it is possible to do needle-point monopolar electrocauterization only at the needle tip because of the insulation of the other parts of the needle by the silicone catheter. By retracting the needle with catheter on it during electrocauterization, electrothrombosis was achieved through and around the channel of the needle, leaving vascularized tissue areas between the channels to perfuse the skin or mucosa covering the hemangioma.\nThis technique was applied as a single treatment or before surgery for the treatment of cavernous hemangiomas to more than 40 patients. However, adequate documentation was found for only 10 patients. After percutaneous electrocauterization of deep hemangiomas, discrete areas of skin necrosis appeared in some patients during the healing period, but the subsequent debridement and surgical excisions were easier because of the thrombosis effect of the technique due to the diffuse denaturation and fibrosis through and around the electrocauterization channels. The follow-up period was 1-13 years.\nThe proposed percutaneous electrocauterization technique for the treatment of deep hemangiomas achieved four effects: (1) volume reduction, (2) bleeding reduction, (3) anesthesia time reduction, and (4) cost reduction.

{"title": "Slit2-Robo4 signalling promotes vascular stability by blocking Arf6 activity.", "abstract": "Slit-Roundabout (Robo) signalling has a well-understood role in axon guidance. Unlike in the nervous system, however, Slit-dependent activation of an endothelial-specific Robo, Robo4, does not initiate a guidance program. Instead, Robo4 maintains the barrier function of the mature vascular network by inhibiting neovascular tuft formation and endothelial hyperpermeability induced by pro-angiogenic factors. In this study, we used cell biological and biochemical techniques to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the maintenance of vascular stability by Robo4. Here, we demonstrate that Robo4 mediates Slit2-dependent suppression of cellular protrusive activity through direct interaction with the intracellular adaptor protein paxillin and its paralogue, Hic-5. Formation of a Robo4-paxillin complex at the cell surface blocks activation of the small GTPase Arf6 and, consequently, Rac by recruitment of Arf-GAPs (ADP-ribosylation factor- directed GTPase-activating proteins) such as GIT1. Consistent with these in vitro studies, inhibition of Arf6 activity in vivo phenocopies Robo4 activation by reducing pathologic angiogenesis in choroidal and retinal vascular disease and VEGF-165 (vascular endothelial growth factor-165)-induced retinal hyperpermeability.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of partial, subtotal and total splenectomies on the distribution of Escherichia coli in the mononuclear phagocytic system.\nThirty-two rats divided into four groups were studied: sham operation (total spleen preservation), partial splenectomy, subtotal splenectomy and total splenectomy. Five weeks after surgeries, an aliquot of E. coli marked with tecnetium-99m was injected intravenously. The animals were killed 20min later and the spleen, lungs and liver were removed in order to determine the distribution of labeled bacteria.\nThe amount of E. coli in the splenic tissue was greater in the intact spleen group than in the partial or subtotal splenectomy groups. Phagocytosis through the spleen did not differ between the partial and subtotal splenectomy groups. The amount of bacteria in the lungs was greater in the partial than in the subtotal splenectomy group. The distribution of labeled bacteria was greater in the liver of animals submitted to subtotal splenectomy than in the other groups.\nThe upper splenic pole, supplied only by splenogastric vessels, has the ability to remove live bacteria from the blood stream, showing that effective blood clearance occurs even without vascularization through the splenic pedicle.

A549-TPalpha cells induced greater tumor growth and increased vascularization in tumors than in the control A549 cells. Increased angiogenesis was further verified by studying the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in A549-TPalpha cells. I-BOP, an agonist of TP, stimulated the expression of VEGF in this cell line as well as in another human lung cancer H157 cells in a time and dose dependent manner. The expression of VEGF was determined at both the mRNA and protein levels. The signaling pathways that are involved in I-BOP-induced VEGF expression were further examined by the use of inhibitors. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation blocked the induction almost completely indicating that ERK activation was an essential step in the induction.

The authors investigated EPC mobilization in patients undergoing limb lengthening.\nThirteen of 24 consecutive patients who underwent limb-lengthening procedures on weight-bearing long bones (femur and tibia) were included in this study. Peripheral blood samples were taken at four different time points from each patient, that is, before operation (pre-Op), 2 or 3 days after osteotomy (early-PO), before the start of distraction (pre-Dist), and at 7 to 14 days after the start of distraction (during-Dist). Numbers of leukocytes and levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined. After isolating mononuclear cells (MNCs) by centrifugation, we performed FACS analysis on freshly isolated MNCs using antibodies to the cell surface markers; CD34, CD133, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and alkaline phosphatase. MNCs were also cultured in endothelial cell growth medium and numbers of EPC colony-forming units were counted. Plasma levels of EPC-mobilizing cytokines, such as, VEGF, SDF-1, and MCP-1, were determined by ELISA.\nNumbers of leukocytes and CRP plasma levels increased significantly during the early-PO period (p<0.01) but were maintained within normal range in the during-Dist period. FACS analysis of freshly isolated MNCs showed that EPC-enriched cell fractions increased after distraction, but that alkaline phosphatase-positive cell numbers were unchanged. Numbers of EPC colony-forming units significantly increased in the during-Dist period (p<0.01). Plasma levels of VEGF and SDF-1 significantly increased in the during-Dist period (p<0.05).

{"title": "A new procedure for determining the genetic basis of a physiological process in a non-model species, illustrated by cold induced angiogenesis in the carp.", "abstract": "Physiological processes occur in many species for which there is yet no sequenced genome and for which we would like to identify the genetic basis. For example, some species increase their vascular network to minimise the effects of reduced oxygen diffusion and increased blood viscosity associated with low temperatures. Since many angiogenic and endothelial genes have been discovered in man, functional homolog relationships between carp, zebrafish and human were used to predict the genetic basis of cold-induced angiogenesis in Cyprinus Carpio (carp). In this work, carp sequences were collected and built into contigs. Human-carp functional homolog relationships were derived via zebrafish using a new Conditional Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit (CSRBH) protocol. Data sources including publications, Gene Ontology and cDNA libraries were then used to predict the identity of known or potential angiogenic genes. Finally, re-analyses of cold carp microarray data identified carp genes up-regulated in response to low temperatures in heart and muscle.\nThe CSRBH approach outperformed all other methods and attained 8,726 carp to human functional homolog relationships for 16,650 contiguous sequences. This represented 3,762 non-redundant genes and 908 of them were predicted to have a role in angiogenesis.

RPE cell death or dysfunction drives the pathophysiology of many retinal diseases, but the physiological response of the retina to RPE cell loss is poorly understood, mainly because of the absence of suitable experimental models. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse in which an inducible Cre recombinase is expressed exclusively in the RPE under the control of the monocarboxylate transporter 3 gene promoter (RPE(CreER)). This was crossed with a transgenic mouse harboring a diphtheria toxin A (DTA) chain gene rendered transcriptionally silent by a floxed stop sequence. We show that activation of DTA in the double transgenic mouse (RPE(CreER)/DTA) led to 60-80% RPE cell death, with surviving cells maintaining the integrity of the monolayer by increasing their size. Despite the apparent morphological normality of the enlarged RPE cells in the RPE(CreER)/DTA mice, functional analysis revealed significant deficits on electroretinography, and retinal histopathology showed regions of photoreceptor rosetting and degeneration although with retention of a normal vascular network. Our study reveals that whilst the RPE monolayer has a remarkable intrinsic capacity to cope with cellular attrition, specific aspects of RPE multifunctionality essential for photoreceptor survival are compromised. The RPE(CreER)/DTA mouse offers advantages over models that employ chemical or mechanical strategies to kill RPE cells, and should be useful for the development and evaluation of RPE-based therapies, such as stem cell transplantation.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2009-10-24", "authors": ["RebeccaLongbottom", "MarcusFruttiger", "Ron HDouglas", "Juan PedroMartinez-Barbera", "JohnGreenwood", "Stephen EMoss"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0902593106"}

Their regulation in the growth plate is crucial for normal matrix assembly. Endochondral ossification, which takes place at the growth plates, is influenced by mechanical loading. Using an in vivo avian model for mechanical loading, we have found increased blood penetration into the growth plates of loaded chicks. The purpose of this work was to study the involvement of MMP-2, -3, -9, -13, and -16 in the growth plate's response to loading and in the catch-up growth resulting from load release. We found that mechanical loading, as well as release from load, upregulated MMP-2, -9, and -13 expressions. In contrast, MMP-3, associated with cartilage injuries, and its associated protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), were downregulated by the load. However, after release from load, MMP-3 was upregulated and CTGF levels were elevated and caught up with the control. MMP-3 and CTGF were also downregulated after 60 min of mechanical stretching in vitro.

{"title": "Cardiovascular risk factors and collateral artery formation.", "abstract": "Arterial lumen narrowing and vascular occlusion is the actual cause of morbidity and mortality in atherosclerotic disease. Collateral artery formation (arteriogenesis) refers to an active remodelling of non-functional vascular anastomoses to functional collateral arteries, capable to bypass the site of obstruction and preserve the tissue that is jeopardized by ischaemia. Hemodynamic forces such as shear stress and wall stress play a pivotal role in collateral artery formation, accompanied by the expression of various cytokines and invasion of circulating leucocytes. Arteriogenesis hence represents an important compensatory mechanism for atherosclerotic vessel occlusion. As arteriogenesis mostly occurs when lumen narrowing by atherosclerotic plaques takes place, presence of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes) is highly likely. Risk factors for atherosclerotic disease affect collateral artery growth directly and indirectly by altering hemodynamic forces or influencing cellular function and proliferation. Adequate collateralization varies significantly among atherosclerotic patients, some profit from the presence of extensive collateral networks, whereas others do not. Cardiovascular risk factors could increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in certain patients because of the reduced protection through an alternative vascular network. Likewise, drugs primarily thought to control cardiovascular risk factors might contribute or counteract collateral artery growth.

The vascular network is established during embryogenesis to supply oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and organs. However, after cardiac or peripheral ischemia is caused by occlusion of the vessels, new vessels must be formed to rescue the ischemic tissues. Many angiogenic growth factors and chemokines are produced in the ischemic tissue to induce angiogenic sprouting of preexisting vessels. Branched vessels must be again restabilized to form mature vessels that deliver blood to the tissues. To this end, vascular EC-cell adhesion is tightly regulated by cell-cell adhesion molecules and extracellular stimuli that activate G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases exclusively expressed on vascular ECs.

Mutations in the Frizzled-4 (Fz4) receptor, Lrp5 coreceptor, or Norrin ligand cause retinal hypovascularization, but the mechanisms by which Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling controls vascular development have not been defined. Using mouse genetic and cell culture models, we show that loss of Fz4 signaling in endothelial cells causes defective vascular growth, which leads to chronic but reversible silencing of retinal neurons. Loss of Fz4 in all endothelial cells disrupts the blood brain barrier in the cerebellum, whereas excessive Fz4 signaling disrupts embryonic angiogenesis. Sox17, a transcription factor that is upregulated by Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling, plays a central role in inducing the angiogenic program controlled by Norrin/Fz4/Lrp.

Compared to other sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), human fetal MSC (hfMSC) have recently been shown to be more proliferative and osteogenic. We studied the functional performance of hfMSC-mediated TEBG in 7 mm rat femoral critical-sized bone defects (CSD). Dynamically-cultured and osteogenically-primed hfMSC seeded onto macroporous poly-epsilon-caprolactone tri-calcium phosphate scaffolds were transplanted into CSDs. After 12 weeks, hfMSC-mediated TEBG induced 2.1x more new bone formation (43.3+/-10.5 vs. 21.0+/-7.4 mm(3), p<0.05), with greater compact and woven bone, and a 9.8x increase in stiffness (3.9+/-1.7 vs. 0.4+/-0.3 mNm/degree, p<0.05) compared to acellular scaffolds, such that only animals transplanted with TEBG underwent full fracture repair of the CSD. Although hfMSC survived for <4 weeks, by 4 weeks they were associated with a 3.9x larger vasculature network in the defect area (35.2+/-11.1 vs. 6.5+/-3.6 mm(3)p<0.05), suggesting an important role for hfMSC in the promotion of neo-vasculogenesis.

{"title": "3D multi-cell simulation of tumor growth and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "We present a 3D multi-cell simulation of a generic simplification of vascular tumor growth which can be easily extended and adapted to describe more specific vascular tumor types and host tissues. Initially, tumor cells proliferate as they take up the oxygen which the pre-existing vasculature supplies. The tumor grows exponentially. When the oxygen level drops below a threshold, the tumor cells become hypoxic and start secreting pro-angiogenic factors. At this stage, the tumor reaches a maximum diameter characteristic of an avascular tumor spheroid. The endothelial cells in the pre-existing vasculature respond to the pro-angiogenic factors both by chemotaxing towards higher concentrations of pro-angiogenic factors and by forming new blood vessels via angiogenesis. The tumor-induced vasculature increases the growth rate of the resulting vascularized solid tumor compared to an avascular tumor, allowing the tumor to grow beyond the spheroid in these linear-growth phases. First, in the linear-spherical phase of growth, the tumor remains spherical while its volume increases. Second, in the linear-cylindrical phase of growth the tumor elongates into a cylinder. Finally, in the linear-sheet phase of growth, tumor growth accelerates as the tumor changes from cylindrical to paddle-shaped. Substantial periods during which the tumor grows slowly or not at all separate the exponential from the linear-spherical and the linear-spherical from the linear-cylindrical growth phases. In contrast to other simulations in which avascular tumors remain spherical, our simulated avascular tumors form cylinders following the blood vessels, leading to a different distribution of hypoxic cells within the tumor. Our simulations cover time periods which are long enough to produce a range of biologically reasonable complex morphologies, allowing us to study how tumor-induced angiogenesis affects the growth rate, size and morphology of simulated tumors.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2009-10-17", "authors": ["AbbasShirinifard", "J ScottGens", "Benjamin LZaitlen", "Nikodem JPop\u0142awski", "MaciejSwat", "James AGlazier"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0007190"}
{"title": "VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis requires inverse and reciprocal regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is critical for tumor angiogenesis. However, therapies based on inhibition of VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) have shown modest results for patients with cancer. Surprisingly little is known about mechanisms underlying the regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression, the main targets of these drugs. Here, analysis of tissue microarrays revealed an inversely reciprocal pattern of VEGFR regulation in the endothelium of human squamous-cell carcinomas (high VEGFR1, low VEGFR2), as compared with the endothelium of control tissues (low VEGFR1, high VEGFR2). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that VEGF signals through the Akt/ERK pathway to inhibit constitutive ubiquitination and induce rapid VEGFR1 accumulation in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, VEGFR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of endothelial cells. In contrast, VEGF signals through the JNK/c-Jun pathway to induce endocytosis, nuclear translocation, and downregulation of VEGFR2 via ubiquitination. VEGFR1 signaling is required for endothelial-cell survival, while VEGFR2 regulates capillary tube formation. Notably, the antiangiogenic effect of bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) requires normalization of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 levels in human squamous-cell carcinomas vascularized with human blood vessels in immunodeficient mice.

We investigated the cell biology using markers for inflammation, proliferation, collagen synthesis, apoptosis, and vascularization/myofibroblasts. Quantitative immunohistochemical image analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction with cell mapping was performed on labeled serial sections. Flexor tendon adhesions were also assessed 21 days after wounding using transmission electron microscopy to examine the cell phenotypes in the wound. When the tendon has been immobilized, the mouse can form tendon adhesions in the flexor tendon sheath. The cell biology of tendon healing follows the classic wound healing response of inflammation, proliferation, synthesis, and apoptosis, but the greater activity occurs in the surrounding tissue. Cells that have multiple \"fibripositors\" and cells with cytoplasmic protrusions that contain multiple large and small diameter fibrils can be found in the wound during collagen synthesis.

{"title": "Implanted microvessels progress through distinct neovascularization phenotypes.", "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that implanted microvessels form a new microcirculation with minimal host-derived vessel investment. Our objective was to define the vascular phenotypes present during neovascularization in these implants and identify post-angiogenesis events. Morphological, functional and transcriptional assessments identified three distinct vascular phenotypes in the implants: sprouting angiogenesis, neovascular remodeling, and network maturation. A sprouting angiogenic phenotype appeared first, characterized by high proliferation and low mural cell coverage. This was followed by a neovascular remodeling phenotype characterized by a perfused, poorly organized neovascular network, reduced proliferation, and re-associated mural cells. The last phenotype included a vascular network organized into a stereotypical tree structure containing vessels with normal perivascular cell associations. In addition, proliferation was low and was restricted to the walls of larger microvessels. The transition from angiogenesis to neovascular remodeling coincided with the appearance of blood flow in the implant neovasculature. Analysis of vascular-specific and global gene expression indicates that the intermediate, neovascular remodeling phenotype is transcriptionally distinct from the other two phenotypes. Therefore, this vascular phenotype likely is not simply a transitional phenotype but a distinct vascular phenotype involving unique cellular and vascular processes. Furthermore, this neovascular remodeling phase may be a normal aspect of the general neovascularization process. Given that this phenotype is arguably dysfunctional, many of the microvasculatures present within compromised or diseased tissues may not represent a failure to progress appropriately through a normally occurring neovascularization phenotype.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2009-10-17", "authors": ["Sara SNunes", "Kevin AGreer", "Chad MStiening", "Helen Y SChen", "Kameha RKidd", "Mark ASchwartz", "Chris JSullivan", "HarishRekapally", "James BHoying"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2009.10.001"}

It is largely resistant to conventional cancer treatment, including most schemes of hormonal and cytokine therapy as well as to modern chemotherapy. Although IFN-alpha has been the first choice in mRCC treatment strategies for more than a decade, recent recommendations of the European Association of Urology focus on so-called molecular-targeted therapies, with multikinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib and sunitinib, blocking the progression of cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, as preferential therapy. Sorafenib targets the VEGF receptor, the PDGF receptor beta and, finally, Raf kinase, and is approved for patients who have either received cytokines or are unsuitable for such a therapy. Although targeted therapies reveal superior efficacy compared with previous cytokine-based approaches, they do not cure patients with metastatic disease. Therefore, following tumor progression, most patients require a second-line or sequential therapy during the further progress of the disease. Owing to the fact that optimal sequencing of these new agents has not been fully elucidated, some recent mainly retrospective studies compared the sequence of sorafenib and sunitinib in order to assess the best clinical benefit in mRCC patients. Apparently, no cross-resistance could be observed in any trial, and most results demonstrated a superior efficacy of a sequence strategy when sorafenib was applied as first-line treatment.

{"title": "Impact of VEGF-dependent tumour micro-environment on EDB fibronectin expression by subcutaneous human tumour xenografts in nude mice.", "abstract": "Fibronectin (FN) is an extracellular matrix cell-adhesive glycoprotein. The alternative spliced isoform EDB-FN (extra domain B containing FN) is highly expressed in tumour blood vessels and stroma and represents a candidate for tumour targeting. To investigate the impact of different angiogenic micro-environments on EDB-FN expression, we used a tumour model in which human endometrial adenocarcinoma Tet-FGF2 cells overexpressing fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) driven by the tetracycline-responsive promoter were further transfected with a VEGF antisense cDNA, generating AS-VEGF/Tet-FGF2 cells. In this model, the expression of FGF2 plus VEGF results in fast-growing, highly vascularized Tet-FGF2 tumours. Down-regulation of FGF2 production by tetracycline administration and/or of VEGF production by AS-VEGF transduction inhibited tumour growth and vascularization, with profound changes in tumour micro-environment. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis using human EDB-FN primers shows that subcutaneous grafting in immunodeficient mice is per se sufficient to cause a dramatic up-regulation of EDB-FN expression by these cells, as well as by human oesophageal cancer KYSE 30 cells and renal carcinoma Caki-1 cells. However, in vivo down-regulation of VEGF expression, as occurs in AS-VEGF/Tet-FGF2 tumours, and to a lesser extent of FGF2 expression, as occurs in tetracycline-treated Tet-FGF2 tumour-bearing animals, causes significant inhibition of EDB-FN production in tumour grafts, as shown by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Accordingly, treatment of Tet-FGF2 tumour-bearing animals with the neutralizing anti-murine VEGF receptor-2 antibody DC101, or of Caki-1 tumour-bearing animals with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, inhibited EDB-FN expression in tumour grafts. EDB-FN down-regulation was paralleled by a decrease in vascularity, thus confirming EDB-FN as a marker of tumour angiogenesis. These data demonstrate that the angiogenic micro-environment, and in particular the VEGF/VEGFR-2 system, plays a key role in modulating EDB-FN expression by tumour cells in vivo.

In this study we investigated whether human dental pulp stromal (stem) cells (DP-SCs) committed to the angiogenic fate. DP-SCs showed the specific mesenchymal immunophenotypical profile positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD105, CD166 and negative for CD14, CD34, CD45, in accordance with that reported for bone marrow-derived SCs. The Oct-4 expression in DP-SCs, evaluated through RT-PCR analysis, increased in relation with the number of the passages in cell culture and decreased after angiogenic induction. In agreement with their multipotency, DP-SCs differentiated toward osteogenic and adipogenic commitments. In angiogenic experiments, differentiation of DP-SCs, through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction, was evaluated by in vitro matrigel assay and by cytometric analysis. Accordingly, endothelial-specific markers like Flt-1 and KDR were basally expressed and they increased after exposure to VEGF together with the occurrence of ICAM-1 and von Willebrand factor positive cells. In addition, VEGF-induced DP-SCs maintained endothelial cell-like features when cultured in a 3-D fibrin mesh, displaying focal organization into capillary-like structures. The DP-SC angiogenic potential may prove a remarkable tool for novel approaches to developing tissue-engineered vascular grafts which are useful when vascularization of ischemic tissues is required.", "journal": "International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology", "date": "2009-10-14", "authors": ["CMarchionni", "LBonsi", "FAlviano", "GLanzoni", "ADi Tullio", "RCosta", "MMontanari", "P LTazzari", "FRicci", "GPasquinelli", "COrrico", "AGrossi", "CPrati", "G PBagnara"], "doi": "10.1177/039463200902200315"}

A variety of vascularized bone grafts can be used. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two types of vascularized bone graft -- a distal radial pedicle graft and a free vascularized medial femoral condyle graft -- in the treatment of scaphoid waist nonunions associated with proximal pole osteonecrosis and carpal collapse.\nA retrospective review was conducted at two institutions to identify all patients with a scaphoid waist nonunion associated with an avascular proximal pole and carpal collapse. Between January 1994 and June 2006, twenty-two such nonunions were identified in twenty-two patients. Ten were treated with a distal radial pedicle vascularized graft and twelve, with a free vascularized medial femoral condyle graft. Patient demographics were similar between the groups, and the duration of follow-up averaged twelve months. Union was determined with use of plain radiographs and computed tomography or trispiral tomograms. In addition, carpal angles, time to union, union rates, and complications were recorded.\nFour of the ten nonunions treated with the distal radial pedicle graft healed, at a median of nineteen weeks, and all twelve nonunions treated with the free medial femoral condyle graft healed, at a median of thirteen weeks. The rate of union was significantly higher (p = 0.005) and the median time to healing was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) for the nonunions treated with the medial femoral condyle graft.\nA vascularized interposition graft from the medial femoral condyle is the recommended vascularized bone graft for the surgical treatment of scaphoid waist nonunion with avascularity of the proximal pole and carpal collapse.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

{"title": "Was dinosaurian physiology inherited by birds? Reconciling slow growth in archaeopteryx.", "abstract": "Archaeopteryx is the oldest and most primitive known bird (Avialae). It is believed that the growth and energetic physiology of basalmost birds such as Archaeopteryx were inherited in their entirety from non-avialan dinosaurs. This hypothesis predicts that the long bones in these birds formed using rapidly growing, well-vascularized woven tissue typical of non-avialan dinosaurs.\nWe report that Archaeopteryx long bones are composed of nearly avascular parallel-fibered bone. This is among the slowest growing osseous tissues and is common in ectothermic reptiles. These findings dispute the hypothesis that non-avialan dinosaur growth and physiology were inherited in totality by the first birds. Examining these findings in a phylogenetic context required intensive sampling of outgroup dinosaurs and basalmost birds. Our results demonstrate the presence of a scale-dependent maniraptoran histological continuum that Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds follow. Growth analysis for Archaeopteryx suggests that these animals showed exponential growth rates like non-avialan dinosaurs, three times slower than living precocial birds, but still within the lowermost range for all endothermic vertebrates.\nThe unexpected histology of Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds is actually consistent with retention of the phylogenetically earlier paravian dinosaur condition when size is considered. The first birds were simply feathered dinosaurs with respect to growth and energetic physiology.

{"title": "Techniques on modeling the vascularized free fibula flap in mandibular reconstruction.", "abstract": "In mandibular reconstruction with bone grafts, the functional and aesthetic outcomes are clearly influenced by reconstructive techniques. Vascularized free fibular flaps are considered the most suitable choice for mandible reconstruction because of their good aesthetic and functional outcomes. Several techniques have been described in literature. According to various authors, shaping of the fibular graft can be performed by means of computer-aided design/computer-aided modeling procedures for the evaluation of the presurgery anatomy and three-dimensional models of fibula graft. However, these models are expensive, require a strict realization of the programmed intervention, and are not easily adaptable to a surgical treatment different from the planned one. We report our experience on a technique for mandibular reconstruction using a free fibular flap, obtained by modeling a template on the resected mandible. Our operative technique consists of 5 steps: preplating, resection, template modeling, contouring of the fibula, and fixing the flap on the mandible.Template modeling is performed to record the length of the resected bone, the mandibular curvature on the 3 space planes, and the width of the basal bone. On the basis of the template, the fibula flap was modeled while still attached to the pedicle. The plates, positioned at the level of the fibular osteotomies, were preformed to make the fibula precisely fit in the template. Once the fibula was shaped, mandibular reconstruction was completed by positioning the fibula graft on the mandibular stumps. Bone graft modeling by means of template is a rapid, safe, and flexible method to reconstruct the mandible.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2009-10-10", "authors": ["AlessandroMoro", "RaffaelaCannas", "RobertoBoniello", "GiulioGasparini", "SandroPelo"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181b0db5c"}
{"title": "Optimization of lidocaine application in tumescent local anesthesia.", "abstract": "Tumescent local anesthesia is based upon the infusion of large volumes of neutralized anesthetic solutions, mainly lidocaine, at very low concentrations. This results in the paralysis of sensory nerve endings and minute nerve twigs, leading to a reduction in pain. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of lidocaine application in tumescent local anesthesia on different regions of patient's bodies. Measures of safety included the analysis of lidocaine concentrations and its pharmacokinetic parameters. In total, 48 patients were infused with tumescent anesthesia in the hypogastrium, buttocks and thighs, axillae, breasts, trunk, and face and neck areas. Lidocaine was infused in doses ranging from 5.2-40 mg/kg b.w., and in concentrations of 0.05% (hypogastrium, buttocks, thighs) or 0.1-0.15% (axillae, breasts, trunk, face, neck), using a total amount of 300-3200 mg. As the peak lidocaine concentration did not exceed 5 microg/ml (commonly known as the toxic threshold), the results of our study indicate that the doses used (not exceeding 40 mg/kg b.w.) are completely safe for patients undergoing tumescent anesthesia in different body areas. The observation of statistically significant correlations between both the dose and the total amount of lidocaine administered and its peak plasma concentration, together with the lack of correlations between the dose and the amount and the time taken to reach peak concentration, allows the safety of each anesthetic dose to be predicted. An analysis of the heterogeneous dynamics of lidocaine plasma concentration changes in tumescent anesthesia in different body areas indicates that both the rates and the degrees of absorption and elimination depend on the area of infiltration; this is in turn related to the vascularization of any given area. The study of lidocaine concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters also showed that there may potentially be a higher risk of a large anesthetic concentration developing within a short period of time during anesthesia of the upper parts of the body. During tumescent anesthesia, significantly higher plasma concentrations of lidocaine were observed in the face and neck than in the hypogastrium, buttocks and thighs, axillae, breast and trunk 0.5 to 4 h after its infusion.

Polyester-polyurethane sponges, used as a framework for fibrovascular tissue growth, were implanted in Swiss mice. Atorvastatin (0.6, 3 mg/kg/day) was given orally for 8 days in drinking water. The implants collected at day 9 postimplantation were processed for the assessment of hemoglobin, myeloperoxidase (MPO), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and collagen. Relevant inflammatory, angiogenic and fibrogenic cytokines were also determined. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant decrease in sponge vascularization (Hb content) and in VEGF levels at both doses. Neutrophil influx (MPO activity) was not affected by the compound whereas macrophage recruitment (NAG activity) was inhibited, suggesting a degree of selectivity by atorvastatin for this cell population. The level of CCL2 (MCP1-JE) was decreased only with 0.6 mg/kg. Atorvastatin was also able to reduce collagen deposition and the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) intraimplant, dose-dependently.

{"title": "Selective cytotoxicity of Ponciri Fructus against glucose-deprived PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells via blocking activation of GRP78.", "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer cells are sometimes exposed to stressful microenvironments such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia, and starvation of other nutrients. These stresses, which are characteristic of poorly vascularized solid tumors, activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is a stress-signaling pathway present in tumor cells that is associated with molecular chaperone GRP78. Induction of GRP78 has been found to increase cell survival and decrease apoptotic potential through genetic alterations. Thus GRP78 may represent a novel target in the development of anticancer drugs. Here we established a novel screening program to identify chaperone modulators that exhibit preferential cytotoxic activity in glucose-deprived pancreatic cancer cells. During the course of our screening, we isolated an active substance, Ponciri Fructus (PF), from an herbal medicine source and identified it as a down-regulator of GRP78. As expected, PF inhibited expression of the GRP78 protein under glucose-deprivation conditions in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it induced selective cytotoxicity against glucose-deprived cancer cells; this effect was not observed under normal growth conditions. We also detected apoptotic bodies on Hoechst staining and attempted to determine whether PF-induced apoptosis involved caspase-3 activation.

It is the interaction between these molecules that determines cellular response to apoptotic signals, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. In recent experiments designed to study tumor angiogenesis, Bcl-2 upregulation in endothelial cells was shown to be a critical mediator of vascular development. In this article, we develop a mathematical model that explicitly incorporates the response of endothelial cells to variations in proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins in the Bcl family, as well as the administration of specific antiangiogenic therapies targeted against Bcl-2. The model is validated by comparing its predictions to in vitro experimental data that reports microvessel density prior to and following the administration of 0.05 to 5.0 micromol/L of BL193, a promising small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2. Numerical simulations of in vivo treatment of tumors predict the existence of a threshold for the amount of therapy required for successful treatment and quantify how this threshold varies with the stage of tumor growth. Furthermore, the model shows how rapidly the least effective dosage of BL193 decreases if an even moderately better inhibitor of Bcl-2 is used and predicts that increasing cell wall permeability of endothelial cells to BL193 does not significantly affect this threshold.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors are expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells and cooperate with Met to induce tumor invasion and vascularization. EXEL-2880 (XL880, GSK1363089) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that targets members of the HGF and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase families, with additional inhibitory activity toward KIT, Flt-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and Tie-2. Binding of EXEL-2880 to Met and VEGF receptor 2 (KDR) is characterized by a very slow off-rate, consistent with X-ray crystallographic data showing that the inhibitor is deeply bound in the Met kinase active site cleft. EXEL-2880 inhibits cellular HGF-induced Met phosphorylation and VEGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and prevents both HGF-induced responses of tumor cells and HGF/VEGF-induced responses of endothelial cells. In addition, EXEL-2880 prevents anchorage-independent proliferation of tumor cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In vivo, these effects produce significant dose-dependent inhibition of tumor burden in an experimental model of lung metastasis.

These obstacles include the lack of a primary Ad attachment receptor on tumor cells in situ, as well as innate host defense mechanisms that recognize Ads as pathogens and act to facilitate their elimination. This review focuses on anatomical barriers inside solid tumors that limit Ad transduction, and specifically barriers associated with several factors: (i) the mechanisms of tumor vascularization and the metabolic microenvironment; (ii) the tumor stroma, which tightly surrounds nests of malignant cells; and (iii) the epithelial phenotype of cancer cells, particularly the trapping of viral receptors in tight and adherens junctions. Potential strategies to overcome these obstacles are also presented. Because published data on the physical barriers to Ad transduction of tumors in situ are limited, studies with other macromolecules used in tumor therapy are also discussed.", "journal": "Current opinion in molecular therapeutics", "date": "2009-10-07", "authors": ["RobertStrauss", "Andr\u00e9Lieber"], "doi": null}

Here, we identify HIF-2alpha as a marker of normoxic neural crest-like neuroblastoma tumor-initiating/stem cells (TICs) isolated from patient bone marrows. Knockdown of HIF-2alpha reduced VEGF expression and induced partial sympathetic neuronal differentiation when these TICs were grown in vitro under stem cell-promoting conditions. Xenograft tumors of HIF-2alpha-silenced cells were widely necrotic, poorly vascularized, and resembled the bulk of tumor cells in clinical neuroblastomas by expressing additional sympathetic neuronal markers, whereas control tumors were immature, well-vascularized, and stroma-rich. Thus, HIF-2alpha maintains an undifferentiated state of neuroblastoma TICs. Because low differentiation is associated with poor outcome and angiogenesis is crucial for tumor growth, HIF-2alpha is an attractive target for neuroblastoma therapy.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2009-10-07", "authors": ["AlexanderPietras", "Loen MHansford", "A SofieJohnsson", "EstherBridges", "JonasSj\u00f6lund", "DavidGisselsson", "MatildaRehn", "SivBeckman", "RosaNoguera", "SamuelNavarro", "J\u00f6rgCammenga", "ErikFredlund", "David RKaplan", "SvenP\u00e5hlman"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0904606106"}
{"title": "Physiological function and transplantation of scaffold-free and vascularized human cardiac muscle tissue.", "abstract": "Success of human myocardial tissue engineering for cardiac repair has been limited by adverse effects of scaffold materials, necrosis at the tissue core, and poor survival after transplantation due to ischemic injury. Here, we report the development of scaffold-free prevascularized human heart tissue that survives in vivo transplantation and integrates with the host coronary circulation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were differentiated to cardiomyocytes by using activin A and BMP-4 and then placed into suspension on a rotating orbital shaker to create human cardiac tissue patches. Optimization of patch culture medium significantly increased cardiomyocyte viability in patch centers. These patches, composed only of enriched cardiomyocytes, did not survive to form significant grafts after implantation in vivo. To test the hypothesis that ischemic injury after transplantation would be attenuated by accelerated angiogenesis, we created \"second-generation,\" prevascularized, and entirely human patches from cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells (both human umbilical vein and hESC-derived endothelial cells), and fibroblasts. Functionally, vascularized patches actively contracted, could be electrically paced, and exhibited passive mechanics more similar to myocardium than patches comprising only cardiomyocytes. Implantation of these patches resulted in 10-fold larger cell grafts compared with patches composed only of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the preformed human microvessels anastomosed with the rat host coronary circulation and delivered blood to the grafts. Thus, inclusion of vascular and stromal elements enhanced the in vitro performance of engineered human myocardium and markedly improved viability after transplantation.

However, the use of stem cells alone to promote angiogenesis remains limited because of insufficient expression of angiogenic factors and low cell viability after transplantation. Here, we have developed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) high-expressing, transiently modified stem cells for the purposes of promoting angiogenesis. Nonviral, biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles were developed to deliver hVEGF gene to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human embryonic stem cell-derived cells (hESdCs). Treated stem cells demonstrated markedly enhanced hVEGF production, cell viability, and engraftment into target tissues. S.c. implantation of scaffolds seeded with VEGF-expressing stem cells (hMSCs and hESdCs) led to 2- to 4-fold-higher vessel densities 2 weeks after implantation, compared with control cells or cells transfected with VEGF by using Lipofectamine 2000, a leading commercial reagent. Four weeks after intramuscular injection into mouse ischemic hindlimbs, genetically modified hMSCs substantially enhanced angiogenesis and limb salvage while reducing muscle degeneration and tissue fibrosis.

Ewing sarcoma affecting clavicle is uncommon. We report 5 cases of Ewing sarcoma of clavicle treated in our institution. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 11.6 years (2 to 15 y). There were 3 males and 2 females. All patients received chemotherapy before and after the surgery. Likewise, radiotherapy was administrated after tumor excision in one patient. Different methods of surgical treatment were used and included: claviculectomy, claviculectomy and vascularized fibular autograft, and claviculectomy and clavicle allograft. One patient died during the follow-up because of the recurrence of the tumor and presence of metastatic disease. The remaining 4 patients had good functional outcomes with no pain of the shoulder at final follow-up. In conclusion, Ewing sarcoma of clavicle is a very rare tumor and different methods of surgical treatment can be used.

CgA and the CgA-derived peptides vasostatin-I and catestatin are products of polymorphonuclear neutrophils accumulating at sites of injury or infections while SgII and the Sg II-derived secretoneurin may contribute to neurogenic inflammation when released from sensory nerve terminals. This review is directed towards vasostatin-I, catestatin and secretoneurin as modulators of cells and tissues associated with inflammatory conditions. The accumulated literature indicates that concerted effects of vasostatin-I and catestatin may be relevant for the first-line host-defence against invading microorganisms, contrasting the apparent lack of antibacterial potencies in secretoneurin. Oppositely directed effects of vasostatin-I and secretoneurin on endothelial permeability and transendothelial extravasation are particularly striking. While vasostatin-I protects the integrity of the endothelial barrier against the disruptive effects of proinflammatory agents, secretoneurin activates transendothelial extravasation, chemotaxis and migration of leukocytes. Oppositely directed effects of vasostatin-I and secretoneurin on formation of blood vessels are also indicated, vasostatin-I inhibiting angiogenetic parameters while secretoneurin activates not only angiogenesis but also vascularization.", "journal": "Regulatory peptides", "date": "2009-10-06", "authors": ["Karen BHelle"], "doi": "10.1016/j.regpep.2009.09.009"}

Over both 3 and 7 days in vitro, seeded endothelial cells (ECs) had increased proliferation on scaffolds with immobilized VEGF and/or Ang1 compared to unmodified scaffolds and soluble growth factor controls.

We recently studied mast cell density in pediatric age group on rather larger number of cases in a referral children hospital. Mast cell density was 12.6 +/- 0.87 in 0.25 mm2 (range: 0-81) in our study.Since we frequently encounter cases with rather normal gastric biopsies with no H. pylori, which mainly complain of chronic abdominal pain, we gathered those cases with mast cell density more than 30/0.25 mm2. from 895 gastric biopsies and wanted to study their clinical and endoscopic findings and propose a new entity.\nBetween April 2005 and May 2008, 895 children (< 14 years old), with gastrointestinal complaints who underwent endoscopy were selected and antral biopsies were obtained for histological examination. Among these children, those who had normal or erythematous (but not nodular or ulcerative) gastric mucosa on endoscopic view, plus pathologic report of normal mucosa or mild gastritis in addition to mast cell count more than 30/25 mm2, were chosen and a questionnaire was filled for each patient including clinical, endoscopic and pathologic findings.The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nOver a 3 year period of study, of 895 selected children, 86 patients fulfilled the entrance criteria.

Recruitment of the transplanted LSKCD34(-) hematopoietic cells first occurs in the femoral head and is continuous during 24 hours. Quantification of the fluorescence emitted by the transplanted hematopoietic cells shows that proliferation of LSKCD34(-) hematopoietic cells in the femoral head was potent 3 days after transplantation. Using a development of this fiber-optic imaging system, we show that the transplanted LSKCD34(-) hematopoietic cells are associated with vascularized structures as early as 5 hours after transplantation.

The purpose of this study is to assess the post-operative outcomes after radical ablative surgery and reconstruction for patients with a tongue cancer. We conducted a retrospective comparison of two different reconstruction techniques. From January 2000 to December 2006, 70 consecutive patients with tongue cancer had been treated with curative intent by extensive ablative surgery and soft-tissue reconstruction. Sixty percent of tumors were T3 or T4. We compared the post-operative outcomes of both populations: 25 patients underwent FTT and 45 underwent pedicled PMMF. Fifty-seven men and 13 women with a mean age of 55 years constitute the study population. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, and addiction.

Although we observed formation of bone in all scaffolds, the origin of bone cells and the ossification type were strictly dependent on the nature and commitment of the seeded cells. MSC implants led to formation of bone of host origin through the activation of an endochondral ossification process while an intramembranous ossification directly performed by the seeded cells was observed in OB implants.

On this basis, we stably transfected MMP12 and PTX3 in two breast cancer cell lines expressing very low amounts of the target molecules when compared with normal breast epithelial cells, relying on the hypothesis that antiangiogenic molecules released by cancer cells could confer an SSc-like antiangiogenic pattern on target endothelial cells. In Matrigel Boyden chamber invasion and capillary morphogenesis studies, transfected clones reduced endothelial cell invasion and capillary tube formation, which were abolished by tumor cell populations expressing both molecules. The Matrigel sponge assay, performed in vivo in C57/BL6 mice by injecting aliquots of lyophilized culture medium of transfected clones, indicated a similar reduction in angiogenesis. Functional studies have shown that endothelial cells treated with a culture medium of MMP12-expressing clones underwent cleavage of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor domain 1 which is indispensable to angiogenesis. We did not observe angiostatin production from plasminogen under the same experimental conditions. PTX3-overexpressing clones showed a powerful anti-fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) activity in FGF2-dependent capillary morphogenesis.

Although the effects of overexpressing angiogenic growth factors have been studied in inducing angiogenesis, the formation of functional vessels remains a challenge. The present study evaluates the reversal of diabetes-mediated impairment of angiogenesis in the infarcted diabetic rat myocardium by proangiogenic gene therapy.\nAd*VEGF and Ad*Ang1 were intramyocardially administered in combination immediately after myocardial infarction to nondiabetic and diabetic rats. Ad*LacZ was similarly administered to the respective control groups. The hearts were excised for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis at predetermined time points. The myocardial function was measured by echocardiography 30 days after the intervention.\nWe observed reduced fibrosis and increased capillary/arteriolar density along with reduced ventricular remodeling, as assessed by echocardiography in the treated diabetic animals compared with the nontreated diabetic controls. We also observed increased phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2, 2 days after the treatment and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flk-1, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Tie-2, and survivin, 4 days after treatment in the diabetic animals. Gel shift analysis revealed that the combination gene therapy stimulated the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB in the diabetic animals.\nOur preclinical data demonstrate the efficacy of coadministration of adenoviral VEGF and Ang-1 in increasing angiogenesis and reducing ventricular remodeling in the infarcted diabetic myocardium.

However, little is known about the detailed mechanisms of the antitumor activity of Cepharanthine. In the present study, we determined whether Cepharanthine could suppress angiogenesis and growth of human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells in vitro and in vivo. Cepharanthine significantly inhibited expression of two major pro-angiogenic molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), in cultured cells and in cells implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of nude mice. Also, Cepharanthine inhibited the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in human OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. The decreased expression of VEGF and IL-8 correlated with decreased tumor cell growth and decreased vascularization in vitro and in vivo.

The theory of inosculation (that skin grafts subsequently obtain nourishment via blood vessel \"anastomosis\" between new vessels invading from the wound bed and existing graft vessels) was hotly debated from the late 19th to mid-20th century. This study aimed to noninvasively observe blood flow in split skin grafts and Integra dermal regeneration matrix to provide further proof of inosculation and to contrast the structure of vascularization in both materials, reflecting mechanism.\nObservations were made both clinically and using confocal microscopy on normal skin, split skin graft, and Integra. The VivaScope allows noninvasive, real-time, in vivo images of tissue to be obtained.\nObservations of blood flow and tissue architecture in autologous skin graft and Integra suggest that 2 very different processes are occurring in the establishment of circulation in each case. Inosculation provides rapid circulatory return to skin grafts whereas slower neovascularization creates an unusual initial Integra circulation.\nThe advent of confocal laser microscopy like the VivaScope 1500, together with \"virtual\" journals such as ePlasty, enables us to provide exciting images and distribute them widely to a \"reading\" audience.

I used vibroliposuction and performed plicature of the muscular aponeurosis through tunnels (where there are no important muscular perforator vessels), without damaging the vascularization.

According to this new treatment concept, vibroliposuction is used in GI. Vibroliposuction and suprapubic fusiform skin resection with an indigenous canoe shape are used in GII. Vibroliposuction, fusiform skin resection, and plicature of the external oblique muscle aponeurosis through two lateral tunnels are used in GIII. Vibroliposuction, fusiform skin resection, plicature of the rectus muscles aponeurosis through a medial tunnel, and detachment of the umbilicus aponeurotic implantation and reattachment in a maximum proportion of 1/1.6 between the infra- and supraumbilical skin segment with a bolster stitch are used in GIV.

An orthopedic surgeon did a wide resection of the malignant bone tumor, leaving a massive bone defect about 11.3 cm in length. A double-barreled free vascularized fibular bone was designed to reconstruct the femoral bone defect. The maximal fibular bone graft harvested was 19 cm long; after the osteotomy, one barrel was 11 cm and the other was 8 cm. An iliac crest cancellous bone graft was harvested to fill the residual space. The pathology report showed a grade 1 well-differentiated conventional chondrosarcoma, and further adjuvant therapy was not suggested. At a 3-year follow-up, plain radiography showed a good bony union of the graft, and the patient could easily tolerate daily activity. A vascularized double-barreled fibular graft is an ideal option for reconstructing a massive defect in weight-bearing bone: it provides not only sufficient mechanical strength but also good union for early rehabilitation.

In vitro, NCTD inhibited viability of normal HUVECs to a lesser extent than CT26 cancer cells. At concentrations less than those inhibiting 50% of the cells, NCTD inhibited migration and capillary-like tube formation of HUVECs. The anti-angiogenic effect of NCTD was accompanied by anoikis, down-regulation of integrin beta1, and breakdown of vimentin. NCTD decreased MAPK expression of phosphorylated (p)-JNK and p-ERK.

{"title": "The significance of neuronal and glial cell changes in the rat retina during oxygen-induced retinopathy.", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity is a devastating vascular disease of premature infants. A number of studies indicate that retinal function is affected in this disease. Using the rat model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, it is possible to explore more fully the complex relationship between neuronal, glial and vascular pathology in this condition. This review examines the structural and functional changes that occur in the rat retina following oxygen-induced retinopathy. We highlight that vascular pathology in rats is characterized by aberrant growth of blood vessels into the vitreous at the expense of blood vessel growth into the body of the retina. Moreover, amino acid neurochemistry, a tool for examining neuronal changes in a spatially complete manner reveals widespread changes in amacrine and bipolar cells. In addition, neurochemical anomalies within inner retinal neurons are highly correlated with the absence of retinal vessels. The key cell types that link blood flow with neuronal function are macroglia. Macroglia cells, which in the retina include astrocytes and M\u00fcller cells, are affected by oxygen-induced retinopathy. Astrocyte loss occurs in the peripheral retina, while M\u00fcller cells show signs of reactive gliosis that is highly localized to regions that are devoid of intraretinal blood vessels. Finally, we propose that treatments, such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, that not only targets pathological angiogenesis, but that also promotes re-vascularization of the retina are likely to prove important in the treatment of those with retinopathy of prematurity.", "journal": "Documenta ophthalmologica.

In the knee joint of miniature pigs, cartilage lesions were treated by microfracturing and were then either left empty, covered with a collagen membrane, or treated by matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation. In control lesions, the subchondral bone plate was left intact (partial-thickness lesion). The repair tissues were analyzed after 12 weeks by histological methods focusing on bone formation and vascularization. The effect of chondrocytes on angiogenesis was assessed by in vitro assays. The presence of antiangiogenic proteins in cartilage repair tissue, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and chondromodulin-I (ChM-I), was detected immunohistochemically and their expression in chondrocytes and bone marrow stromal cells was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Significant outgrowths of subchondral bone and excessive endochondral ossification within the repair tissue were regularly observed in lesions with an exposed or microfractured subchondral bone plate. In contrast, such excessive bone formation was significantly inhibited by the additional transplantation of chondrocytes. Cartilaginous repair tissue that resisted ossification was strongly positive for the antiangiogenic proteins, TSP-1 and ChM-I, which were, however, not detectable in vascularized osseous outgrowths. Chondrocytes were identified to be the major source of TSP-1- and ChM-I expression and were shown to counteract the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells.

A dramatic increase in expression of mCRP occurs in angiogenic blood vessels derived from stroked brain regions, atherosclerotic arteries and active vessels from other angiogenic diseases such as Alzheimer's. Furthermore, mCRP unlike the native molecule is highly angiogenic to vascular endothelial cells in vitro and therefore might impact on the processes of vascularization and re-modelling thus affecting tissue survival and development. In this mini-review, we will discuss the differences in the biological properties between nCRP and mCRP. We will provide a brief historical background to the importance of nCRP as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease. We will explain the mechanisms of conversion of nCRP to its monomeric form and describe evidence for the role of mCRP in modulation of endothelial cell activation, promotion of inflammatory status and thrombus formation in cardio/cerebrovascular disease. Finally, we will provide evidence for the accumulation of mCRP in angiogenic microvessels from diseased tissue, and demonstrate its highly pro-angiogenic capabilities. The discovery of the existence of this tissue-associated, highly angiogenic monomeric form of CRP capable of cellular binding and intra-cellular signal transduction activation may help in our understanding of the processes responsible for modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation in disease.", "journal": "Histology and histopathology", "date": "2009-09-18", "authors": ["MSlevin", "JKrupinski"], "doi": "10.14670/HH-24.1473"}
{"title": "Induction of epithelial mesenchimal transition and vasculogenesis in the lenses of Dbl oncogene transgenic mice.", "abstract": "The Dbl family of proteins represents a large group of proto-oncogenes involved in cell growth regulation. The numerous domains that are present in many Dbl family proteins suggest that they act to integrate multiple inputs in complicated signaling networks involving the Rho GTPases. Alterations of the normal function of these proteins lead to pathological processes such as developmental disorders and neoplastic transformation. We generated transgenic mice introducing the cDNA of Dbl oncogene linked to the metallothionein promoter into the germ line of FVB mice and found that onco-Dbl expression in mouse lenses affected proliferation, migration and differentiation of lens epithelial cells.\nWe used high density oligonucleotide microarray to define the transcriptional profile induced by Dbl in the lenses of 2 days, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks old transgenic mice. We observed modulation of genes encoding proteins promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as down-regulation of epithelial cell markers and up-regulation of fibroblast markers. Genes encoding proteins involved in the positive regulation of apoptosis were markedly down regulated while anti-apoptotic genes were strongly up-regulated. Finally, several genes encoding proteins involved in the process of angiogenesis were up-regulated. These observations were validated by histological and immunohistochemical examination of the transgenic lenses where vascularization can be readily observed.\nOnco-Dbl expression in mouse lens correlated with modulation of genes involved in the regulation of EMT, apoptosis and vasculogenesis leading to disruption of the lens architecture, epithelial cell proliferation, and aberrant angiogenesis.

After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 28 patients having three years minimum follow-up (mean 4.6 years) were included. Delay between injury and operation varied from four weeks to 42 weeks (mean 16.4 weeks). Closed reduction was achieved in 17 patients; open reduction through Watson-Jones anterolateral approach was performed in the remaining 15 patients in whom closed reduction failed. The fracture was transfixed with three parallel guide wires. Appropriate sized cannulated lag screw (7 mm) was then inserted in two of the wires. Selection of the third guide wire for fibula depended on the space available in both anteroposterior and lateral view.\nSatisfactory bony union was obtained in 25 patients, of whom in four cases, the union occurred in 10-20 degrees (mean 15 degrees ) of varus.

The use of vascularized grafts have shown better clinical results. The vascular pedicle bone graft is an easy to perform operation and does not require special equipment. We analyzed and report a series of patients of osteonecrosis of femoral head treated by core decompression and vascular pedicle grafting of part of iliac crest based on deep circumflex iliac vessels.\nThe article comprises of the retrospective study of 31 patients of osteonecrosis of femoral head in stage II and III treated with core decompression and vascular pedicle grafting by using part of iliac crest with deep circumflex iliac vessels from January 1990 to December 2005. The young patients with a mean age 32 years (18-52 years) with a minimum follow-up of five years were included for analysis. Sixteen patients had osteonecrosis following alcohol abuse, 12 patients following corticosteroid consumption, 3 patients had idiopathic osteonecrosis. Nine patients were stage IIB, and 22 patients were stage IIIC according to ARCO's system. The core decompression and vascular pedicle grafting was performed by anterior approach by using part of iliac crest with deep circumflex iliac vessels.\nDigital subtraction arteriography performed in 9 patients at the end of 12 weeks showed the patency of deep circumflex artery in all cases, and bone scan performed in 6 other patients showed high uptake in the grafted area of the femoral head proving the efficacy of the operative procedure. Out of 31 patients, only one patient progressed to collapse and total joint replacement was advised. At the final follow up period of 5-8 years, Harris Hip Score improved mean +/- SD of 28.2 +/- 6.4 (p < 0.05). Forty-eight percent of patients had an improvement in Harris Hip Score of more that 28 points.\nThe core decompression and vascular pedicle grafting reduces the intraosseous tension to achieve early revascularization of ischemic femoral head.

{"title": "Adipose tissue engineering: state of the art, recent advances and innovative approaches.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue is a highly specialized connective tissue found either in white or brown forms, the white form being the most abundant in adult humans. Loss or damage of white adipose tissue due to aging or pathological conditions needs reconstructive approaches. To date, two main strategies are being investigated for generating functional adipose tissue: autologous tissue/cell transplantation and adipose tissue engineering. Free-fat transplantation rarely achieves sufficient tissue augmentation owing to delayed neovascularization, with subsequent cell necrosis and graft volume shrinkage. Tissue engineering approaches represent, instead, a more suitable alternative for adipose tissue regeneration; they can be performed either with in situ or de novo adipogenesis. In situ adipogenesis or transplantation of encapsulated cells can be useful in healing small-volume defects, whereas restoration of large defects, where vascularization and a rapid volumetric gain are strict requirements, needs de novo strategies with 3D scaffold/filling matrix combinations. For adipose tissue engineering, the use of adult mesenchymal stem cells (both adipose- and bone marrow-derived stem cells) or of preadipocytes is preferred to the use of mature adipocytes, which have low expandability and poor ability for volume retention.

In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate LeTx targets endothelial cells. However, the effects of LeTx on endothelial cells are incompletely characterized. To gain insight into this process we used a developmental model of vascularization in the murine retina. We hypothesized that application of LeTx would disrupt normal retinal vascularization, specifically during the angiogenic phase of vascular development. By immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy we observed that MAPK activation occurs in a spatially and temporally regulated manner during retinal vascular development. Intravitreal administration of LeTx caused an early delay (4 d post injection) in retinal vascular development that was marked by reduced penetration of vessels into distal regions of the retina as well as failure of sprouting vessels to form the deep and intermediate plexuses within the inner retina. In contrast, later stages (8 d post injection) were characterized by the formation of abnormal vascular tufts that co-stained with phosphorylated MAPK in the outer retinal region. We also observed a significant increase in the levels of secreted VEGF in the vitreous 4 d and 8 d after LeTx injection. In contrast, the levels of over 50 cytokines other cytokines, including bFGF, EGF, MCP-1, and MMP-9, remained unchanged. Finally, co-injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibodies significantly decreased LeTx-induced neovascular growth.

Differences between DS and NDS groups were statistically evaluated by means of ANOVA test and posterior Bonferroni comparisons.\nThe morphometric analysis revealed more irregular-shaped AgNORs in the superficial and suprabasal layers of the oral mucosa of DS patients. The suprabasal layers also exhibited a significantly larger number of AgNORs.

This skill demanding model has a steep learning curve and is accompanied by high mortality rates. Investigations were carried out to minimize these disadvantages and a whiskers flap properly named mystacial pad flap, was developed. The mystacial pad contains the whiskers follicles of the rat, and our aim was to investigate the effect of repairing the nerves on the whiskers function after mystacial pad allotransplantation in rats. A total of 56 animals were studied in 6 groups. In the main study group (VI), 16 semi-allogenic vascularized mystacial flaps were transplanted from Lewis-Brown-Norway (RT1(l+n)) to Wistar-Lewis (RT1(l)) rats. This group was divided in 2 subgroups; in subgroup VIa (nonneurotized alloflap transplant group, n = 8), alloflaps were transplanted without nerve repairs, whereas in subgroup VIb (neurotized alloflap transplant group, n = 8) the facial and trigeminal nerves were repaired.

{"title": "Antiangiogenesis therapy might have the unintended effect of promoting tumor metastasis by increasing an alternative circulatory system.", "abstract": "Antiangiogenesis therapy is one of the most promising approaches to cancer treatment. Its clinical success has come out but still too limited. Vascularization of tumor is a complex and heterogenous process. So far, it has been demonstrated that several additional mechanisms can provide the tumor with oxygen and nutrients. Moreover, it is now clear that vascularization of tumor does not necessarily depend on endothelial cells proliferation and sprouting of new capillaries. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) as an alternative circulatory system, has been described in multiple malignant tumor types, and considered to be associated with a poor prognosis for the patient. VM serves as an adjunct to the existing vasculature system, thereby aiding tumor growth as well as contributing to the metastatic process. Moreover, hypoxia has been confirmed to promote some tumor cells to form vessel-like tubes in vitro and express genes associated with VM. Yet, the current antiangiogenesis strategies, which are directed mainly against the tumor endothelium and then cause hypoxia of tumor cells, have no effect on VM. Our central hypothesis is that when the endothelium-dependent vessels are inhibited by the effective angiogenesis inhibitors, the hypoxia of tumor cells caused by antiangiogenesis may increase VM compensatively which can replace the job of endothelium-dependent vessels to maintain the tumor blood supply and provide a convenient route of tumor metastasis. As a result, antiangiogenesis therapy might have the unintended effect of promoting tumor metastasis by increasing VM. Thus, treatment strategies that target the tumor microcirculation should not only target endothelium-dependent vessels, but also take VM into account in tumors presenting VM.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2009-09-12", "authors": ["BoQu", "LongGuo", "JinluMa", "YiLv"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2009.08.020"}
{"title": "CHICAGO, PERISCOPE and PROactive: CV risk modification in diabetes with pioglitazone.", "abstract": "Recent trials of intensive glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and its impact on cardiovascular disease have led to confusion and speculation amongst physicians. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study was terminated early because of a significant excess all-cause mortality in the intensively-treated group. Furthermore the ADVANCE and VADT trials did not demonstrate cardiovascular benefit with more intensive glycaemic control. Against this background, it is pertinent to re-visit and critically appraise the results of the PROactive study which examined the effects of the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, on cardiovascular end-points in a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in type 2 diabetic patients with symptomatic disease. PROactive has been rightly criticized in the choice of its composite primary end-point which included a physician-driven as opposed to a disease-driven outcome, namely peripheral vascular re-vascularization. This was primarily responsible for the primary composite end-point not being achieved; whereas there was a significant beneficial impact on the major secondary end-point of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. The results of PROactive have been supported by two subsequent studies examining the impact of pioglitazone on important surrogates of atherosclerosis, namely carotid intima/medial thickness (IMT) and coronary atheroma volume as delineated with intravascular ultrasound. The CHICAGO study demonstrated that IMT in type 2 diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone did not progress whereas those treated with glimepiride showed progression. In PERISCOPE atheroma volume progressed with glimepiride but did not with pioglitazone. This is exciting data pointing to the cardiovascular benefits of pioglitazone. In PROactive, CHICAGO and PERISCOPE there was a sustained effect of pioglitazone on glycaemic control and, in addition, beneficial effects in reducing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol beyond that seen with concomitant statin therapy. These findings strongly suggest that pioglitazone has an important place in the management of type 2 diabetes.", "journal": "Fundamental & clinical pharmacology", "date": "2009-09-12", "authors": ["D JohnBetteridge"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1472-8206.2009.00741.x"}

Because islet inflammation may originate from endothelial cells, we assessed the expression of selected genes involved in endothelial cell activation in islets from a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. We also examined islet endotheliuml/oxidative stress (OS)/inflammation-related gene expression, islet vascularization and fibrosis after treatment with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).\nGene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR on islets isolated from 10-week-old diabetic GK and control Wistar rats. Furthermore, GK rats were treated s.c twice daily with IL-1Ra (Kineret, Amgen, 100 mg/kg/day) or saline, from 4 weeks of age onwards (onset of diabetes). Four weeks later, islet gene analysis and pancreas immunochemistry were performed. Thirty-two genes were selected encoding molecules involved in endothelial cell activation, particularly fibrinolysis, vascular tone, OS, angiogenesis and also inflammation. All genes except those encoding angiotensinogen and epoxide hydrolase (that were decreased), and 12-lipoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor (that showed no change), were significantly up-regulated in GK islets. After IL-1Ra treatment of GK rats in vivo, most selected genes implied in endothelium/OS/immune cells/fibrosis were significantly down-regulated. IL-1Ra also improved islet vascularization, reduced fibrosis and ameliorated glycemia.\nGK rat islets have increased mRNA expression of markers of early islet endothelial cell activation, possibly triggered by several metabolic factors, and also some defense mechanisms. The beneficial effect of IL-1Ra on most islet endothelial/OS/immune cells/fibrosis parameters analyzed highlights a major endothelial-related role for IL-1 in GK islet alterations. Thus, metabolically-altered islet endothelium might affect the beta-cell microenvironment and contribute to progressive type 2 diabetic beta-cell dysfunction in GK rats.

Recent genetic studies revealed that the Slit3 is dispensable for neural development but required for non-neuron-related developmental processes, such as the genesis of the diaphragm and kidney. Here we report that Slit3 potently promotes angiogenesis, a process essential for proper organogenesis during embryonic development. We observed that Slit3 is expressed and secreted by both endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in vasculature and that the Slit cognate receptors Robo1 and Robo4 are universally expressed by endothelial cells, suggesting that Slit3 may act in paracrine and autocrine manners to regulate endothelial cells. Cellular function studies revealed that Slit3 stimulates endothelial-cell proliferation, promotes endothelial-cell motility and chemotaxis via interaction with Robo4, and accelerates endothelial-cell vascular network formation in vitro with a specific activity comparable with vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, Slit3 stimulates neovessel sprouting ex vivo and new blood vessel growth in vivo.

Neuropilins (NRPs) have been implicated in tumor growth and vascularization, as novel mediators of the primary immune response and in regeneration and repair; however, their role in renal pathophysiology is largely unknown. Here, we report upregulation of tubular and interstitial NRP2 protein expression in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In an additional cohort of patients with minimal change disease (MCD), membranous nephropathy (MN), and FSGS, elevated NRP2 mRNA expression in kidney biopsies inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of biopsy.

Two features distinguish adipose tissue from other organs--the ability to greatly expand its mass, via increases in cell size and/or number, and the wide anatomical distribution. While adipose tissue function is greatly affected by adipocyte size and anatomic location, regulations of adipocyte size, number, and body fat distribution are poorly understood. Transplantation of either mature adipose tissue or adipocyte progenitor cells has been used in studying adipocyte function and biogenesis. In this review, we will attempt to summarize methodological considerations for transplantation, including selections of donor material, transplantation site and the length of transplantation study, as well as effects of these factors and vascularization and innervation on the function of transplants. Specific studies are also reviewed to illustrate the utility of adipose tissue transplants in studying adipose tissue function and biogenesis. The focus is on studies in three areas: (1) use of transplants in demonstrating adipose tissue function, such as effects of adipose tissue transplants on metabolism and energy homeostasis of the recipient animals and depot-specific differences in adipose tissue function; (2) use of transplantation to dissect direct or cell-autonomous from indirect or non-cell-autonomous effects of leptin signaling and sex on adipocyte size; (3) use of transplantation in the identification of adipocyte progenitor cells and lineage analysis.

This study evaluates the relationship between implantation time and tissue structure for generating tissues of clinically relevant volume and structure.\nTwenty skeletally mature domestic sheep were implanted with poly(methyl methacrylate) chambers designed to mimic the size and shape of the mental protuberance of the mandible. Each chamber was filled with morcellized bone graft and implanted with the open face apposed to the cambium layer of the rib periosteum. Chambers were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 weeks, and the tissue inside the chambers was analyzed for shape conformation to chamber geometry, gross tissue volume, and bone histomorphometric parameters.\nHistologically, active endochondral, direct, and appositional bone formation was observed. Calcified tissue area and new bone formation increased for each time point up to 12 weeks of implantation. The tissues formed maintained volumetric and geometrical structure consistent with the chamber up to 9 weeks after implantation. Significant decreases in total volume and agreement with chamber geometry were observed at 12 and 24 weeks.\nPeriosteum-guided tissue prefabrication was found to be an effective means of engineering three-dimensional vascularized bone of clinical size and shape. The optimal duration of incubation before significant volume loss occurs is 9 weeks in this large-animal model.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2009-09-05", "authors": ["Ming-HueiCheng", "Eric MBrey", "Alexander CAllori", "AndrewGassman", "David WChang", "Charles WPatrick", "Michael JMiller"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181b17a91"}
{"title": "Experimental assessment of autologous lymph node transplantation as treatment of postsurgical lymphedema.", "abstract": "The authors' objective was to test whether the transplantation of an autologous lymph node into a nodal excision site in sheep would restore lymphatic transport function and reduce the magnitude of postsurgical lymphedema.\nAs a measure of lymph transport, iodine-125 human serum albumin was injected into prenodal vessels at 8 and 12 weeks after surgery, and plasma levels of the protein were used to calculate the transport rate of the tracer to blood (percent injected per hour). Edema was quantified from the circumferential measurement of the hind limbs.\nThe transplantation of avascular lymph nodes at 8 (n = 6) and 12 weeks (n = 6) produced lymphatic function levels of 12.3 +/- 0.5 and 12.6 +/- 0.8, respectively. These values were significantly less (p < 0.001) than those measured at similar times in the animals receiving sham surgical procedures (16.6 +/- 0.7, n = 6; and 16.1 +/- 0.7, n = 6, respectively). When vascularized transplants were performed, lymphatic function was similar to the sham controls and significantly greater (p < 0.001) than that of the avascular group (8 weeks, 15.8 +/- 0.9, n = 8; 12 weeks, 15.7 +/- 1.0, n = 10). Lymph transport correlated significantly with the health of the transplanted nodes (scaled with histologic analysis) (p < 0.0001). The vascularized node transplants (n = 18) were associated with the greatest clinical improvement, with the magnitude of edema in these limbs exhibiting significantly lower levels of edema (p = 0.039) than nontreated limbs (n = 18).\nThe successful reimplantation of a lymph node into a nodal excision site has the potential to restore lymphatic function and facilitate edema resolution.

This prevascular colonization of the fetal thymus by T-lymphoid progenitor cells is guided by the coordination of CCR7- and CCR9-mediated chemokine signals. However, the intracellular signals that mediate the prevascular migration of T-lymphoid progenitor cells to the fetal thymus are unknown. Here we show that T-lymphoid progenitor cells in fetal mice express two closely related CDM family molecules, DOCK2 and DOCK180. We found that the prevascular fetal thymus accumulation in vivo was significantly reduced in mice doubly deficient for DOCK2 and DOCK180 but not in mice deficient for either DOCK2 or DOCK180. Immature T-lymphoid cells from mice doubly deficient for DOCK2 and DOCK180 were defective in their in vitro migration towards fetal thymus lobes. The T-lymphoid progenitor cells generated in mice lacking DOCK2 and DOCK180 were capable of T-cell development after their transfer into a fetal thymus environment, and the impaired fetal thymus colonization in mice deficient for DOCK2 and DOCK180 was not as severe as that in mice doubly deficient for CCR7 and CCR9.

The mechanisms mediating these defects remain largely unknown at present, thus limiting the development of therapeutic approaches. Using a wound healing model, we here investigate the mechanisms by which IR exposure limits skin regeneration. Our data show that induction of the stromal cell-derived growth factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) is severely impaired in the wounded skin of irradiated, compared to non-irradiated, mice. Hence, we evaluated the potential of bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), which secrete high levels of SDF-1alpha, to improve skin regeneration in irradiated mice. Injection of MSCs into the wound margin led to remarkable enhancement of skin healing in mice exposed to IR. Injection of irradiated MSCs into the wound periphery of non-irradiated mice delayed wound closure, also suggesting an important role for the stromal microenvironment in skin repair. The beneficial actions of MSCs were mainly paracrine, as the cells did not differentiate into keratinocytes. Specific knockdown of SDF-1alpha expression led to drastically reduced efficiency of MSCs in improving wound closure, indicating that SDF-1alpha secretion by MSCs is largely responsible for their beneficial action. We also found that one mechanism by which SDF-1alpha enhances wound closure likely involves increased skin vascularization. Our findings collectively indicate that SDF-1alpha is an important deregulated cytokine in irradiated wounded skin, and that the decline in tissue regeneration potential following IR can be reversed, given adequate microenvironmental support.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2009-09-04", "authors": ["YannickLandry", "OanhL\u00ea", "Kimberly AMace", "Terry ERestivo", "Christian MBeaus\u00e9jour"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00887.x"}
{"title": "Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines increase hyaluronan production by rat synovial membrane in vitro.", "abstract": "Synovial membrane consists of fibroblasts and macrophages forming the synovial lining supported by vascularized subsynovium. Each of these components may specifically react to a particular stimulus. Thus, reactions of isolated synovial cells may not correspond to that of intact tissue. We characterized the production of hyaluronan (HA) by rat synovial membrane exposed in vitro to pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and compared it with previous results obtained with isolated fibroblasts. Synovial membrane dissected from one knee joint served as a control to that from the opposite knee exposed to IL-1 beta, TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma or IL-4 for 24 h. The HA content was determined by ELISA, and hyaluronan synthase (HAS) mRNA by real-time PCR. The size distribution of the HA chain was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The HA content in the freshly dissected synovial membrane was approximately 1 microg and decreased to 0.1 microg after incubation, while in the medium it increased from 0 to 3 to 5 microg. All cytokines stimulated production of HA. The strongest effect was observed in the case of TNF-alpha. The level of HAS1 and HAS2 mRNA increased 2-fold during a 12-h incubation while that of HAS3 decreased. The distribution of the HA chain length did not differ in the medium from the control and stimulated membranes. Transfer of the synovial membrane from the HA-rich synovial fluid into the medium stimulated release of HA from the membrane and increased HAS expression and HA production. Thus, the synovial membrane acts as a sensor reacting to changes in HA concentration in its environment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate production of HA in intact synovial membranes similarly as in cultures of rheumatoid fibroblasts. In contrast, our results suggest that the response to anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-beta1 and IL-4) of the whole synovial membrane differs from that of isolated fibroblasts.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2009-09-03", "authors": ["AnnaHyc", "AnnaOsiecka-Iwan", "JustynaNiderla-Bielinska", "EwaJankowska-Steifer", "StanislawMoskalewski"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm_00000268"}
{"title": "Molecular ultrasound imaging of early vascular response in prostate tumors irradiated with carbon ions.", "abstract": "Individualized treatments with combination of radiotherapy and targeted drugs require knowledge about the behavior of molecular targets after irradiation. Angiogenic marker expression has been studied after conventional radiotherapy, but little is known about marker response to charged particles. For the very first time, we used molecular ultrasound imaging to intraindividually track changes in angiogenic marker expression after carbon ion irradiation in experimental tumors. Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and of alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin in subcutaneous AT-1 prostate cancers in rats treated with carbon ions (16 Gy) was studied using molecular ultrasound and immunohistochemistry. For this purpose, cyanoacrylate microbubbles were synthesized and linked to specific ligands. The accumulation of targeted microbubbles in tumors was quantified before and 36 hours after irradiation. In addition, tumor vascularization was analyzed using volumetric Doppler ultrasound. In tumors, the accumulation of targeted microbubbles was significantly higher than in nonspecific ones and could be inhibited competitively. Before irradiation, no difference in binding of alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin-specific or ICAM-1-specific microbubbles was observed in treated and untreated animals. After irradiation, however, treated animals showed a significantly higher binding of alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin-specific microbubbles and an enhanced binding of ICAM-1-specific microbubbles than untreated controls. In both groups, a decrease in vascularization occurred during tumor growth, but no significant difference was observed between irradiated and nonirradiated tumors. In conclusion, carbon ion irradiation upregulates ICAM-1 and alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin expression in tumor neovasculature.

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), one of the two isoenzymes that produce sphingosine-1-phosphate, is up-regulated in glioblastoma and has been linked to poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In the present study, we found that a potent isotype-specific SphK1 inhibitor, SK1-I, suppressed growth of LN229 and U373 glioblastoma cell lines and nonestablished human GBM6 cells. SK1-I also enhanced GBM cell death and inhibited their migration and invasion. SK1-I rapidly reduced phosphorylation of Akt but had no significant effect on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, another important survival pathway for GBM. Inhibition of the concomitant activation of the c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase pathway induced by SK1-I attenuated death of GBM cells. Importantly, SK1-I markedly reduced the tumor growth rate of glioblastoma xenografts, inducing apoptosis and reducing tumor vascularization, and enhanced the survival of mice harboring LN229 intracranial tumors.

To this end, we have investigated strategies to facilitate vascularization in scaffold materials, in this case poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels. These hydrogels are hydrophilic and resist protein adsorption and subsequent non-specific cell adhesion, but can be modified to contain cell-adhesive ligands and growth factors to support cell and tissue function. Additionally, the hydrogel matrix can include proteolytically degradable peptide sequences in the backbone of the structure to allow cells to control scaffold biodegradation, allowing three-dimensional migration. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic signal, and the cell-adhesive peptide RGDS were each covalently attached to PEG monoacrylate linkers. PEGylated RGDS and VEGF were then covalently immobilized in PEG-diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels in 2D and 3D. Immobilized VEGF increased endothelial cell tubulogenesis on the surface of non-degradable PEGDA hydrogels 4-fold compared to controls without the growth factor. Endothelial cell behavior in 3D collagenase-degradable hydrogels modified with RGDS and VEGF was observed using time-lapse confocal microscopy. Bulk immobilization of VEGF in 3D collagenase-degradable RGDS-modified hydrogels increased endothelial cell motility 14-fold and cell-cell connections 3-fold.

The human Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus critically contribute to the pathogenesis of selected tumor types, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, respectively, where angiogenesis is robust and often disrupted. Lymphangiogenesis, the process by which new lymphatic vessels are formed, is also induced in Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-associated malignancies and in some cases may contribute to metastasis. Recent studies have identified a number of molecules and signaling pathways that underlie angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and clarified the pivotal role of the VEGF family of proteins and their receptors. New treatment modalities that target members of this family have gained approval for clinical use in cancer. Pathogenetic steps are often difficult to dissect in many cancer types, but virus-induced malignancies provide a unique opportunity for understanding the molecular regulation of cancer progression, including angiogenesis.

The results showed that Ad-Rz/IL-24 significantly inhibited VEGF expression and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. The proliferation rate of xenograft tumors treated with Ad-Rz/IL-24 was approximately 50% lower than the rate of the xenograft tumors treated with adenovirus carrying a single gene anti-VEGF hairpin ribozyme (Ad-Rz) or IL-24 (Ad-IL-24) alone. These findings demonstrated the potential therapeutic effect of this dual gene-expressing adenovirus for cancer gene therapy.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2009-09-01", "authors": ["ShujianChang", "WeichangChen", "JichengYang", "YufengXie", "WeihuaSheng"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr_00000158"}

Reconstruction of these defects with vascularized tissue is superior to any other method. The purpose of this study is to describe a novel vascularized pedicled flap from the middle turbinate (MT) mucosa and to assess its feasibility using a cadaveric model.\nTwelve middle turbinate flaps (MTFs) were raised in six fresh cadaveric heads previously injected with colored silicone. Arteries supplying the MT were identified as the turbinate mucoperiosteum was harvested from both its medial and lateral aspects. Length and surface area of the flaps, as well as their ability to cover dural defects of the sella, planum sphenoidale, and fovea ethmoidalis reach were noted.\nAll MTFs adequately covered defects of the planum and fovea ethmoidalis; however, two of the twelve MTFs were not suitable to cover a sellar defect. The mean surface area of the MTFs was 5.6 cm(2). As an independent factor surface area did not correlate with the ability of the flap to cover the sellar defects. However, those flaps that were not suitable for sellar repair were less than 4.0 cm in length.\nHarvesting of a vascular pedicle flap from the MT is feasible, albeit technically demanding. It should be considered as an alternative for the reconstruction of small defects of the fovea ethmoidalis, planum, and sella, particularly for patients for whom a reconstruction with vascularized tissue is desirable but the nasoseptal flap is not available.", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "date": "2009-09-01", "authors": ["Daniel MPrevedello", "JuanBarges-Coll", "Juan CarlosFernandez-Miranda", "VictorMorera", "DeborahJacobson", "RickyMadhok", "Marco C Jdos Santos", "AdamZanation", "Carl HSnyderman", "PaulGardner", "Amin BKassam", "RicardoCarrau"], "doi": "10.1002/lary.20226"}

Absolute values and differences between the lesion and the normal tissue were evaluated.\nHistology analysis revealed 45 PDACs and 15 inflammatory masses in patients with CP. Time-dependent parameters (arrival time and time to peak) were significantly longer in PDACs compared to focal masses. Although markedly lower than in healthy pancreata, the maximum intensity and area under the curve parameters were not significantly different between PDACs and focal lesions in patients with CP.\nIn cases of CP, PDAC and focal masses exhibit different perfusion patterns at a capillary level that can be visualized using the small microbubbles of ultrasound contrast agents.

{"title": "Ultrasonography-guided punctures-with and without puncture guide.", "abstract": "The key requisite of any percutaneous nephrolithotomy technique is access to the collecting system. The kidney has a high degree of vascular network and is liable for vascular injury. Therefore, for an ideal puncture, a percutaneous tract would be developed that leads straight from the skin through a papilla and the target calix into the renal pelvis. Percutaneous renal access can be achieved under fluoroscopic control or using an ultrasonography (US)-guided puncture. The shortcomings and side effects of extensive radiation during therapeutic procedures are well known. The choice of method for the type of access depends on training and personal preference. The advantages of US-guided puncture are avoidance of radiation, avoiding adjacent and visceral injury and, most importantly, intrarenal vascular injury. US offers the shortest and straight access to the collecting system with minimal morbidity. US-guided access is of particular importance in the pediatric population and in special situations in which the procedure is performed with the patient in the supine position. I believe US-guided puncture has a significant reduction in complications. The available ultrasound probes come with a puncture attachment and, on US scanning, the puncture pathway is represented by an electronic dotted line on the scanner screen, which facilitates exact placement of the needle. US-guided access is optimal with a needle guide, because the electronic dotted line helps in assessing the depth and plane of the puncture needle. This helps in reaching the desired calix in the most accurate way. US access without a needle guide is useful in bedside procedures, in grossly hydronephrotic systems, and nonavailability of an electronic guide. We think the punctures with this technique are suboptimal. Both methods need a certain degree of training and orientation.

{"title": "GRP-78 secreted by tumor cells blocks the antiangiogenic activity of bortezomib.", "abstract": "Antiangiogenic effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib were analyzed on tumor xenografts in vivo. Bortezomib strongly inhibited angiogenesis and vascularization in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane. Bortezomib's inhibitory effects on chorioallantoic membrane vascularization were abrogated in the presence of distinct tumor xenografts, thanks to a soluble factor secreted by tumor cells. Through size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography as well as mass spectroscopy, we identified GRP-78, a chaperone protein of the unfolded protein response, as being responsible for bortezomib resistance. Indeed, a variety of bortezomib-resistant solid tumor cell lines (PC-3, HRT-18), but not myeloma cell lines (U266, OPM-2), were able to secrete high amounts of GRP-78. Recombinant GRP-78 conferred bortezomib resistance to endothelial cells and OPM-2 myeloma cells. Knockdown of GRP78 gene expression in tumor cells and immunodepletion of GRP-78 protein from tumor cell supernatants restored bortezomib sensitivity. GRP-78 did not bind or complex bortezomib but induced prosurvival signals by phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase and inhibited p53-mediated expression of proapoptotic Bok and Noxa proteins in endothelial cells. From our data, we conclude that distinct solid tumor cells are able to secrete GRP-78 into the tumor microenvironment, thus demonstrating a hitherto unknown mechanism of resistance to bortezomib.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2009-08-29", "authors": ["JohannKern", "GeroldUntergasser", "ChristophZenzmaier", "BettinaSarg", "GuentherGastl", "EberhardGunsilius", "MichaelSteurer"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2009-03-209668"}

{"title": "Major bone defect treatment with an osteoconductive bone substitute.", "abstract": "A bone defect can be provoked by several pathological conditions (e.g. bone tumours, infections, major trauma with bone stock loss) or by surgical procedures, required for the appropriate treatment. Surgical techniques currently used for treating bone defects may count on different alternatives, including autologous vascularized bone grafts, homologous bone graft provided by musculoskeletal tissue bank, heterologous bone graft (xenograft), or prostheses, each one of them dealing with both specific advantages and complications and drawbacks. The main concerns related to these techniques respectively are: donor site morbidity and limited available amount; possible immune response and viral transmission; possible animal-derived pathogen transmission and risk of immunogenic rejection; high invasiveness and surgery-related systemic risks, long post-operative. physical recovery and prostheses revision need. Nowadays, an ideal alternative is the use of osteoconductive synthetic bone substitutes. Many synthetic substitutes are available, used either alone or in combination with other bone graft. Synthetic bone graft materials available as alternatives to autogeneous bone include calcium sulphates, special glass ceramics (bioactive glasses) and calcium phosphates (calcium hydroxyapatite, HA; tricalcium phosphate, TCP; and biphasic calcium phosphate, BCP). These materials differ in composition and physical properties fro each other and from bone (De Groot in Bioceramics of calcium phosphate, pp 100-114, 1983; Hench in J Am Ceram Soc 74:1487-1510, 1994; Jarcho in Clin Orthop 157:259-278, 1981; Daculsi et al. in Int Rev Cytol 172:129-191, 1996). Both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric HA-based substitutes represent the current first choice in orthopedic surgery, in that they provide an osteoconductive scaffold to which chemotactic, circulating proteins and cells (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells, osteoinductive growth factors) can migrate and adhere, and within which progenitor cells can differentiate into functioning osteoblasts (Szpalski and Gunzburg in Orthopedics 25S:601-609, 2002). Indeed, HA may be extemporarily combined either with whole autologous bone marrow or PRP (platelet rich plasma) gel inside surgical theatre in order to favour and accelerate bone regeneration.

Ablation of Mig-6 results in a partial lethal phenotype in which surviving mice acquire degenerative joint diseases and tumors in multiple organs. We have determined that the early lethality in Mig-6(-/-) mice occurs in the perinatal period, with mice displaying abnormal lung development. Histological examination of Mig-6(-/-) lungs (E15.5-P3) revealed reduced septation, airway over-branching, alveolar type II cell hyperplasia, and disturbed vascular formation. In neonatal Mig-6(-/-) lungs, cell proliferation increased in the airway epithelium but apoptosis increased in the blood vessels. Adult Mig-6(-/-) mice developed features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, when Mig-6 was inducibly ablated in adult mice (Mig-6(d/d)), the lungs were normal. Knockdown of MIG-6 in H441 human bronchiolar epithelial cells increased phospho-EGFR and phospho-AKT levels as well as cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of MIG-6 in human lung microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-L) cells promoted their apoptosis.

{"title": "Neuromedin B induces angiogenesis via activation of ERK and Akt in endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Neuromedin B (NMB) is one of the bombesin-like peptides in mammals. Recently, bombesin-like peptides have been characterized as growth factors in highly vascularized tumors. In this study, we report that NMB potently stimulates in vivo neovascularization in a mouse Matrigel plug and the sprouting of endothelial cells ex vivo in rat aortic rings. In addition, NMB increases the migration and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, treatment of HUVECs with NMB activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK(1/2)), Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increases the level of NO production in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, ERK activation and angiogenic sprouting in response to NMB are significantly blocked by the MEK inhibitor. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) suppresses the NMB-stimulated tubular formation of HUVECs, along with reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. Taken together, these results indicate that NMB is a novel angiogenic peptide, and its angiogenic activity is mediated by activating the MEK/ERK- and PI3K/Akt/eNOS-dependent pathways.

Free vascularized fibular transfer offers the potential for rapid autograft incorporation in limbs compromised by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients treated with free vascularized fibular graft reconstruction of large skeletal defects after tumor resections (mean defect length, 14.8 cm). The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 4.9 years; range, 2-15 years). One patient died with liver and lung metastases at 3 years postoperatively. Loss of limb occurred in one patient. Five patients either had metastatic disease (one patient) or had metastatic disease (four patients) develop after treatment, with a mean time to metastasis of 18 months. The overall complication rate was 16 of 30 (53%), with a reoperation rate of 12 of 30 (40%). Union was attained in all 30 grafts. Primary union was attained in 23 (77%) at a mean of 6 months. Secondary union was achieved in seven (23%) after revision fixation and bone grafting; the mean subsequent time to union was 9.2 months, with an index of 1.33 additional operations per patient. Graft fracture (20%) and infection (10%) were other common complications.

In this study, we examined the acute effects of a tumor vascular disrupting agent (VDA), 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA; ASA404), in an orthotopic model of human HNC. Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to monitor the vascular response of orthotopic FaDu xenografts to VDA therapy. Untreated tumors showed a marked but heterogeneous pattern of enhancement after contrast agent injection on serial T1-weighted (T1W) MR images. After VDA treatment, T2W and T1W MRI revealed evidence of hemorrhaging and lack of functioning vessels (enhancement) within the tumor. Quantitative estimates of relative vascular volume also showed a significant (P < .01) reduction in DMXAA-treated tumors 24 hours after therapy compared with untreated controls. Histology and immunostaining of untreated orthotopic FaDu tumors revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma histology with distinctly visible CD31(+) endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, minimal CD31 staining with irregular endothelial fragments and faint outlines of blood vessels were seen in DMXAA-treated tumor sections. CD31 immunostaining and histology also highlighted the selectivity of vascular damage and tissue necrosis after VDA therapy with no evidence of toxicity observed in normal salivary gland, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle tissues. Together, our results demonstrate a potent and selective vascular disruptive activity of DMXAA in an orthotopic HNC model.

The objective of this work was to investigate release characteristics and osteogenic activity of rhBMP-2, grafted to biodegradable NPs based on succinimide-terminated poly(lactide fumarate) (PLAF-NHS) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide fumarate) (PLGF-NHS) macromers. The release of rhBMP-2 from the NPs, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was linear with time in the first two weeks, and 24.70+/-1.30% and 48.7+/-0.7% of the protein grafted to PLGF-NHS and PLAF-NHS NPs, respectively, was released in the enzymatically active conformation after complete degradation/erosion of the NPs. After 14 days of incubation with bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells, rhBMP-2 grafted to PLAF-NHS and PLGF-NHS NPs was as effective in inducing mineralization as the native rhBMP-2 that was directly added to the cell culture media. At any incubation time, rhBMP-2 grafted to PLAF had the highest expression of osteopontin (OP) and osteocalcin (OC), followed by rhBMP-2 grafted to PLGF and rhBMP-2 directly added to media.

The findings were compared with 55 normal A1 pulleys obtained from fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens.\nThe normal A1 pulley was composed of 3 layers: layer I, an inner, avascular, concave unicellular or bicellular gliding layer containing cartilage-like cells; layer II, a middle layer, also avascular, characterized by spindle-shaped fibroblasts; and layer III, an outer, richly vascularized layer, continuous with the membranous tendons sheath. We used a 3-grade classification, increasing in severity, to describe the histologic abnormalities observed in trigger digit A1 pulleys. Mild abnormalities (grade 1) were those with a fibrocartilaginous gliding surface almost intact. The margin between the fibrocartilaginous and membranous portions of the pulley was well delineated. In moderate abnormalities (grade 2), the avascular fibrocartilaginous gliding surface appeared fissured and thinner. The inner layer (I) was interrupted and replaced by fibrous tissue, with fissures that did not cross through the middle layer (II). A mild vascular network hyperplasia was observed in the outer layer (III), which began to invade the fibrocartilage. In severe abnormalities (grade 3), the fibrocartilaginous gliding surface was thin, discontinuous, or even completely destroyed. The vascular network hyperplasia became excessive and reached the synovial space of the flexor tendon sheath. The histologic features were correlated with the severity of the clinical symptoms (p < .001).\nThe histologic abnormalities observed in the A1 pulley of trigger digits are characteristic and not related to inflammation. As the trigger digit worsens, the gliding surface begins to wear and is gradually replaced by a secondary invasive hyperplasia from the outer layer. These abnormalities could be caused by a modification or an increase of the mechanical stresses along the flexor tendons.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "date": "2009-08-22", "authors": ["KDrossos", "MRemmelink", "NNagy", "Vde Maertelaer", "J LPasteels", "FSchuind"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhsa.2009.05.015"}

These non-native grafts have high complication rates and a depopulated bovine ureter xenograft has recently been developed as an alternative. The aim was to undertake the first systematic review of the histopathology of bovine ureter xenografts (n = 25) utilized for haemodialysis vascular access in humans.\nPre-insertion specimens (n = 7) showed preservation of some cellular architecture and histological antigenicity. Uncomplicated segments of post-insertion specimens (n = 18) showed myofibroblastic in-growth but no luminal endothelialization and no vascularization of the wall, other than at sites of needle puncture. Post-insertion, 50% showed a severe adventitial host inflammatory response with a dominant granulomatous and eosinophil-rich infiltrate. Inflammation was present in grafts with various complications (stenosis, thrombosis, aneurysm), but there was no clear pathogenic link.\nWe conclude that repopulation of bovine ureter xenografts by host cells is limited and that, in specimens removed for complications, an inflammatory reaction to the xenograft is common.

{"title": "Effects of rosiglitazone on ovarian function and fertility in animals with reduced fertility following fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine.", "abstract": "We have previously shown that in utero nicotine exposure causes impaired fertility, follicle immaturity, and ovarian dysfunction in adult female rat offspring. These characteristics overtly resemble the clinical profile of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and recent studies have shown that thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone improve fertility in women with PCOS but the mechanism is not well defined. Our goal was to examine whether rosiglitazone would (1) ameliorate the altered ovarian physiology that occurs following fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine and (2) to examine whether this could be due to normalization of ovarian vascularization. At weaning, offspring of nicotine-exposed dams were given either vehicle (NV) or rosiglitazone (3 mg kg(-1) day(-1); NR). Offspring of saline-exposed dams received vehicle (SV). Tissues were collected when the female offspring reached 26 weeks of age. NV animals had reduced granulosa cell proliferation and increased ovarian cell apoptosis. Treatment with rosiglitazone increased proliferation, and decreased apoptosis, compared NV animals. NV animals had decreased ovarian vascularity relative to controls, whereas NR animals had an intermediate level of ovarian vessel density. Moreover, ovaries from NV animals had decreased levels of the pro-angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endocrine gland-derived VEGF both of which were increased with rosiglitazone treatment. Rosiglitazone reversed some of the nicotine effects in the ovary and increased ovarian vascularization, follicle maturation and improved oocyte competence.

{"title": "Targeted detoxification of selected reactive oxygen species in the vascular endothelium.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress underlies diverse vascular diseases, but its management remains elusive, in part because of our inability to selectively detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pathological sites and our limited understanding which species need to be eliminated. The antioxidant enzymes (AOEs) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (which decompose and H(2)O(2), respectively), conjugated with an antibody to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), bind to endothelial cells and alleviate oxidative stress in cell culture models. Here, we studied the effects of these antioxidant conjugates in mouse models of vascular oxidative stress. Anti-PECAM/catalase and anti-PECAM/SOD conjugates, in contrast to control IgG/AOE conjugates, accumulated in the lungs and vascularized organs after intravenous injection in wild-type, but not PECAM KO mice. Anti-PECAM/catalase, but not anti-PECAM/SOD, protected mice from lung injury induced by H(2)O(2) produced by glucose oxidase deposited in the pulmonary vasculature. Anti-PECAM/catalase also reduced alveolar edema and attenuated decline in arterial oxygen in mice that underwent unilateral lung ischemia/reperfusion, whereas anti-PECAM/SOD was not effective, implying the key role of H(2)O(2) in tissue damage in this pathology. In contrast, anti-PECAM/SOD, but not anti-PECAM/catalase prevented oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin and normalized vasoreactivity in the vessels of mice rendered hypertensive by pretreatment with angiotensin-II. This outcome agrees with reports implicating superoxide and peroxynitrite in altered endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in hypertension.

Although oxygen tension is a powerful stimulus for cells both in vitro and in vivo, the oxygen environment in which such cells would undergo differentiation is commonly overlooked. We examined the effect of long-term (21-days) low oxygen tension (1, 2 and 5%) on the osteogenic differentiation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)/tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) expression of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our data suggest that MSCs undergo osteoblastic differentiation most rapidly under 21% oxygen while oxygen tensions below 5% have an inhibitory effect. Interestingly, there was not a statistically significant difference in osteogenic markers between 5 and 21% oxygen. In addition, our data suggest that oxygen tension affects the expression of individual MMP and TIMPs differently. Low oxygen tension has an inhibitory effect on MMP-13 and TIMP-1 expression, which are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and potentially vascular invasion. In contrast, MMP-2, a metalloproteinase involved in cell migration was not affected by oxygen tension. This data suggests that 21% oxygen may be beneficial for rapid osteogenic differentiation as would be required for the production of individual patient ex vivo constructs. In addition, this has important in vivo implications relating to the importance of early vascularization of sites of orthopedic injury.

{"title": "Blockade of Wnt signaling inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition to direct effects on tumor cells, Wnt signaling might be involved in the organization of tumor microenvironment. In this study, we have explored whether Wnt signaling blockade by exogenous expression of Wnt antagonists could inhibit tumor angiogenesis and control tumor growth. Human Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) were each fused with Fc fragment of human IgG1 to construct fusion proteins WIF1-Fc and sFRP1-Fc. The recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying WIF1-Fc and sFRP1-Fc driven by cytomegalovirus promoter were constructed. Ad-WIF1-Fc or Ad-sFRP1-Fc induced the expression and correct conformation of WIF1-Fc and sFRP1-Fc fusion proteins. These molecules caused down-regulation of E2F1, cyclin D1, and c-myc and promoted cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Treatment of established hepatocellular carcinoma tumors with Ad-WIF1-Fc and/or Ad-sFRP1-Fc resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged animal survival. The antineoplastic effect was associated with increased apoptosis of tumor cells, reduced microvessel density, and decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1. Tube formation and migration of human microvascular endothelial cells and mouse endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) were significantly inhibited by both WIF1-Fc and sFRP1-Fc. In addition, these molecules blocked EPC differentiation and caused EPC apoptosis.

All isografts survived indefinitely and allografts were viable at 200 days post-transplant under low dose of cyclosporine A. Microangiography of the graft revealed preservation of skin, muscle, and bone components. Histologic examination confirmed viability of all allograft components without signs of rejection. Long-term engraftment of donor-origin (RT1(n)) BMC was confirmed by donor-specific chimerism (1.2%) in peripheral blood and bone marrow (1.65%) compartments and by engraftment into lymphoid organs of recipients. The IBOMC transplant proved to be a reliable composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) model.

In this approach, constructs are fabricated into tubes, using stents, and implanted in the omentum to induce vascularization. In order to evaluate the constructs and its environment during the period of in situ tissue engineering in the rat model, micro-computed tomography imaging was performed. Imaging using micro-computed tomography was useful in localization of the position of the construct, evaluation of implant site tissue, degree of peripheral inflammation to neighbouring tissues and migration of the implanted construct. Images also enable the estimation of the dimensions of the construct and imaging of cyst formations or fluid accumulations on the luminal side of the tubular construct or ascites formation. Since micro-computed tomography is a non-invasive method, it can be repeated for evaluation of implanted constructs if in situ tissue engineering is performed over longer periods.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2009-08-18", "authors": ["PiotrSoltysiak", "Amulya KSaxena"], "doi": "10.1002/term.202"}

Hemorrhage from the central airways has also been reported as a rare manifestation of acute tracheobronchial injury, associated with severe disruption of the bronchial vasculature due to highly negative inspiratory pressure. In this clinical report, we describe a case of both acute tracheobronchial and alveolar hemorrhage in a young man, occurring immediately after extubation due to laryngospasm, diagnosed by bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), measurement of the pulmonary edema fluid/plasma protein ratio, and by thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan. We propose that the patient experienced severe postobstructive negative-pressure pulmonary edema, related to increased permeability of the alveolar capillary membrane and a parallel loss of integrity of the bronchial vascular network.

We paired this model with a conventional subcutaneous implantation model for static histological assessment of the interactions between the gel and host tissue. In the static analysis, the heparan sulfate-containing nanofiber gels were found to persist in the tissue for up to 30 days and revealed excellent biocompatibility. Strikingly, as the nanofiber gel biodegraded, we observed the formation of a de novo vascularized connective tissue. In the dynamic experiments using the dorsal skinfold chamber, the material again demonstrated good biocompatibility, with minimal dilation of the microcirculation and only a few adherent leukocytes, monitored through intravital fluorescence microscopy. The new application of the dorsal skinfold model corroborated our findings from the traditional static histology, demonstrating the potential use of this technique to dynamically evaluate the biocompatibility of materials.

The growing interest in the topic is illustrated by several excellent recent reviews discussing the molecular mechanisms that might play a role in the formation of plaque vasculature and that could explain some of the observed associations with pathologic features of experimental and human atherosclerotic lesions. At the same time, these reviews also emphasize that the field is still largely in uncharted territory. Hoping to spark some new investigations, we are taking this opportunity to question some of the common assumptions and to highlight less explored mechanisms. Finally, we are proposing to adopt the term vasa plaquorum to refer to the neovasculature located within the atherosclerotic plaque to distinguish it clearly from vasa vasorum, the native, supporting vasculature of the artery. We suggest that this new nomenclature offers a potential solution to eliminate ambiguity regarding implicit, but frequently neglected, differences between these structures.

The major placental artery providing maternal blood to the vessels of the placental disk has a highly glycosylated matrix surrounded by two-layered folds of trophoblast, forming an apparently rigid structure of unique morphology. The yolk sac is collapsed, with hypertrophied endodermal and mesothelial cells similar to many other bat species.

Mast cells producing chymase, FGF2, TGF-beta1 and VEGF were highly accumulated at the edge of scald wound in +/+ mice during the proliferative and remodeling phases at days 14 and 21. Chymase activity in the injured tissues of +/+ mice decreased in the acute phase, but recovered to no-injury level at days 14 and 21. The number of mast cells and chymase activity were very low in the injured tissues of W/W(V) mice throughout the experiment.\nWound healing after skin scald injury was partially impaired in mast cell-deficient mice.

We report a minimalistic, laparoscopic technique which is safe and avoids management delay.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the operative log of our obesity surgery unit to find all operations performed on LAGB patients for erosion from Jan 2003 to Dec 2007. The cases that underwent this particular technique were identified. Case notes and electronic records were then reviewed for postoperative morbidity and outcomes. The operative technique and indications of this particular method is described which to our knowledge has not been reported before.\nFrom 2003 to 2007, there were 865 LAGB performed. We identified 17 operations performed for erosions in this period; some referred from elsewhere. Among these, an omental plugging technique was used in five patients (median preoperative body mass index 46.5; median age 47; all female). Median timing of presentation was 8 months, with pain/pyrexia in all five (with coexisting obstructive symptoms in four) patients. At endoscopy, three were posterior, partial erosions. Intraoperatively, all were partial erosions (three posterior and two anterior). In theater, we removed the band in all cases and closed the defect with a vascularized omental plug, fashioned using a harmonic scalpel. There were no immediate postoperative complications. On follow-up, two patients stayed the same weight, but in three, the weight increased leading to two needing rebands (at 6 and 8 months).\nOmental plugging is a way of managing LAGB erosion, which in our hands has led to an uneventful postoperative course and future rebanding without undue delay. It is suited patients with incomplete erosion when the endoscopic option is difficult, thereby removing the need for a surveillance period awaiting complete band erosion.", "journal": "Obesity surgery", "date": "2009-08-12", "authors": ["P ThomasCherian", "GGoussous", "ASigurdsson"], "doi": "10.1007/s11695-009-9925-4"}

Between 2004 and 2007, four wide maxillary defects were repaired using the angular vascularized branch of the scapular bone.

No donor site complications or restricted shoulder movements were detected. The only complication was a minor infection of one flap. This procedure is useful, functionally and aesthetically, for reconstruction of wide extensive maxillary defects as bone supplied by the angular branch has a wider arc of rotation in relation to skin flaps and has a longer pedicle length from the axillary artery, long enough to reach the maxilla.

At the molecular level, angiogenesis and barriergenesis occur via the coordinated action of oxygen-responsive molecules (e.g. hypoxia-inducible factor and Src-suppressed C kinase substrate/AKAP12) and soluble factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1), as well as axon guidance molecules and neurotrophic factors.

In addition to regular endothelial-pericyte interaction, the CNS vasculature has a unique system of cell to cell communication between endothelial cells and astrocytes which is known as the blood-brain barrier. Among the pathological conditions of the CNS vascular network, stroke is a major disease in which the supply of blood is decreased. Pro-angiogenic therapy using natural VEGF-A has so far been unsuccessful, indicating the possible need for a new approach related to upstream or downstream regulators involved in the VEGF-signaling pathway, or alternate VEGF family members. By contrast, a pathological increase in the blood supply in the CNS is seen in brain tumors, in particular malignant gliomas. In phase II clinical trials, anti-VEGF therapies have been shown to suppress tumor growth and improve survival rates to some extent. However, tumor invasion and the distant metastasis of gliomas can occur following anti-angiogenic therapy.

Our approach was validated on human tumor xenografts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice treated with the antiangiogenic drug sorafenib. For each experimental model, area normalization allowed the unbiased comparison of several hundreds of images showing different amounts of vascular tissue. In two different tumor types, comparison of Halo values showed statistically significant differences between control and sorafenib-treated samples. Conversely, this effect was not observed in samples from an additional xenograft known to resist the antiangiogenic treatment.

Several efforts have been made in this field including cellular and acellular technologies. In this work we combined the use of stem cells derived from pancreas or submandibular glands expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP(+)) with a commercially available scaffold for dermal regeneration. Cells were isolated, characterized and seeded in a scaffold for dermal regeneration. Scaffolds containing cells were used to induce dermal regeneration in a full skin defect model. After 3 weeks of in vivo regeneration, tissues were harvested and vascularization was analyzed. Results showed that gland-derived stem cells displayed stem cell features and presented multipotential differentiation capacity because they were able to differentiate in cell types representing the 3 different germ layers. After seeding, cells were homogeneously distributed and formed focal adhesions with the scaffold. Metabolic assays showed that cells can be cultured for at least 3 weeks in the scaffold. In vivo, the presence of pancreatic or submandibular stem cells significantly enhanced the vascularization compared to empty scaffolds. Presence of gland-derived stem cells in the regenerating tissue was confirmed by the detection of GFP expression in the wound area. In order to explore the possible mechanisms behind the improvement in vascular regeneration, in vitro experiments were performed, showing that gland-derived stem cells could contribute by angiogenic and vasculogenic mechanisms to this process.

Each ultrasonography in this study was classified as benign or malignant based on the features using the SVM model. All the tumors were sampled using k-fold cross-validation (k=10) to evaluate the diagnostic performance with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of SVM for classifying malignancies were 94%, 69%, 73%, 92% and 81%, respectively. The classification performance in terms of Az value for the ROC curve of the features derived from 3-D power Doppler is 0.91. This study indicates that combining 3-D power Doppler vascularity with patient's age and tumor size offers a good method for differentiating benign and malignant breast tumors.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2009-08-04", "authors": ["Yu-LenHuang", "Shou-JenKuo", "Chia-ChiaHsu", "Hsin-ShunTseng", "Yi-HsuanHsiao", "Dar-RenChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2009.05.014"}
{"title": "Acute elbow dislocation with arterial rupture. Analysis of nine cases.", "abstract": "Elbow dislocations are the most frequently encountered dislocations after shoulder dislocations. In their vast majority these injuries involve only the joint and carry a good prognosis. Close anatomic proximity to the joint of neurovascular structures put them at risk of concomitant injury but this occurrence remains, actually very rare. The objective of this study is to retrospectively analyze the results of nine cases of elbow dislocations with brachial artery complications and to propose coherent therapeutic guidelines derived from this experience.\nFrom 1999 to 2004, 357 elbow dislocations were treated by the traumatology team at the Purpan University Hospital and 340 at the Rangueil University Hospital in Toulouse, France. These two teaching institutions combined their series, contributing to seven dislocations associated with a brachial artery partial rupture, resulting in ischemia. Between 2001 and 2006 at the Le Mans Regional Hospital Center, 138 dislocations of the elbow were treated, and included two cases involving rupture of the brachial artery. In all these institutions' emergency departments, elbow dislocations were mainly treated on an outpatient basis: closed reduction under ultra short-acting products general anesthesia, with stability evaluation followed by cast immobilization. In the rare instances of ischemia, the artery was repaired in concert with the vascular surgery team. All the nine cases had a similar treatment protocol and were submitted to an identical outcome evaluation method. The patients were all males with a mean age of 37.3 years (range, 18-58 years). The combined injury occurred at sports in two cases, because of a fall in three cases and as a result of a traffic accident in four cases. Ischemia was complete in three cases (no radial or ulnar pulse and devascularized hand). In the six other cases, the clinical presentation was subacute. An arteriogram was obtained in five cases after reduction of the dislocation, confirming the brachial axis disruption. Median and/or ulnar nerve injury was suspected in six patients. Only five elbows remained stable after reduction allowing plaster cast immobilization. In the other cases, dislocation recurrence or consequential residual varus/valgus laxity required external fixation or a cross-pinning fixation. An autologous vein, brachial artery bypass was performed in eight cases and an end-to-end anastomosis was carried out in one case. Revascularization was reestablished between 4 and 19 h after injury (mean 10.5 h).\nAll the patients were seen at a minimum of 2 years' follow-up (mean of 4.3 years). On the basis of Mayo Clinic score, the results were considered excellent in three cases, good in four cases, and poor in two cases. No patients complained of elbow instability. The X-rays showed a reduced elbow in all cases and heterotopic ossifications in three cases. No degenerative lesion was observed at the longest follow-up.\nThe incidence of a combined vascular injury with dislocation remains difficult to establish because the literature reports sporadic short series of clinical cases. The prevalence of this association is estimated to be between 0.3 and 1.7% in hospitals. The vascular lesion risk is probably related to the displacement extent and this later as a consequence of the injury intensity. This context calls for a diagnostic warning signal of possibly associated vascular involvement. Assessment of arterial vascularization should be systematic and mandatory with any osteoarticular injury. The slightest vascular status clinical doubt after reducing any dislocation presses for vascular patency work-up: echo-Doppler, angio-scan, arteriography. The multi-parametric nature of these combined injuries explain why their sometimes disappointing outcome remains dependent on the ability to deal with contradictory healing concerns: skin condition, capsular, and ligaments damages, type of revascularization procedure used, joint stability after closed reduction. This last parameter, being a substantial determinant for the period of immobilization, appears crucial to the final functional outcome, particularly in terms of range of motion loss or residual flexion contracture.\nLevel IV.

Preservation of this segment during right hemicolectomy is likely to prevent loss of its function. This study aimed at evaluating the arterial supply of the ICV to help preserve the valve during right hemicolectomy. Fifty-four fresh human cadavers (37 male, 17 female; median age: 54 years, range: 18-90 years) were studied after relatives gave written, informed consent. At postmortem, 20 cm of terminal ileum with the ileocecal segment and up to 20 cm of ascending colon were removed en bloc with its mesentery and blood supply. The ileocolic artery was cannulated and injected with 10 ml of water-soluble red dye under pressure. The arterial supply was dissected to demonstrate a pattern. In all, the ICV was supplied by the ileocolic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric, which divided into an anterior and a posterior cecal artery. A marginal branch of the right colic was noted to contribute to ICV blood supply in only two (4%). Furthermore, study of the anastomosis at the ICV showed that the anterior cecal artery was present in all (100%), posterior cecal in 48 (89%), and recurrent ileal artery in 53 (98%). A rich anastomosis between vessels at the ICV; small \"windows,\" short tributaries, were seen in 38 (70%), whereas a poor anastomotic network at the ICV; large \"windows,\" long tributaries, between these vessels were seen in 12 (22%). In four (8%), we were unable to clearly determine between rich and poor anastomotic networks. Other variants included, absent posterior cecal artery in six (11%) and absent recurrent ileal artery in one (2%). The ICV has a predictable blood supply in the majority of patients.

{"title": "Three-dimensional power Doppler angiography of cyclic ovarian blood flow.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the vascular indices generated by 3-dimensional (3D) power Doppler angiography by evaluating the cyclic changes in the vascularity of normal ovaries, including those that were ovulating, nonovulating, and hormonally suppressed.\nIn this prospective longitudinal observational study, a cohort of premenopausal regularly menstruating women with no known ovarian disease underwent 3D power Doppler imaging every 2 to 3 days for the duration of 1 menstrual cycle. Four indices were generated: vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), vascularization-flow index (VFI), and mean grayness. Comparisons of vascularity were made between ovulating, nonovulating, and hormonally suppressed ovaries. Normal ranges were established and graphed longitudinally.\nEighteen participants (36 ovaries) ages 28 to 45 years underwent an average of 10 examinations, yielding 368 acquired ovarian volumes for analysis. Seven participants used hormonal contraception. The VI, FI, and VFI were closely correlated (Pearson product moment correlation coefficients, 0.52-0.95). The vascular indices of ovulating ovaries were significantly higher than those of nonovulating ovaries (VI, FI, and VFI, all P < .001), with the largest discrepancies during the luteal phase. Hormonally suppressed ovaries had significantly lower vascularity throughout the cycle (VI, P < .002; FI, P < .001; VFI, P < .007). The vascular indices of all groups appeared to drop during the late follicular period and then rise again.\nThe VI would suffice as the principal vascular parameter for 3D power Doppler analysis. Preovulatory scans may be more useful for distinguishing pathologic vascularization. Hormonally suppressed ovaries have significantly lower vascularity throughout the cycle. Normal-appearing ovaries with vascular indices above the normal ranges established by these data may warrant further investigation.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine", "date": "2009-08-01", "authors": ["Joanie MayerHope", "KaraLong", "MarekKudla", "AlanArslan", "TatianaTsymbal", "IrinaStrok", "Ilan ETimor-Tritsch"], "doi": "10.7863/jum.2009.28.8.1043"}

We are reporting the case of a 43-year-old woman who developed progressive bitemporal hemianopsia and visual loss, accompanied by amenorrhea and hyponatremia. Laboratory findings revealed a slightly elevated prolactin level. Cranial MR-imaging displayed an intrasellar and suprasellar lesion with a maximum diameter of 2.5 cm that was suspicious for a pituitary adenoma or tuberculum sellae meningioma. The tumour was approached via a pterional trepanation. Intraoperatively, the tumour was highly vascularized and adhesive to the optic chiasm, the floor of the third ventricle, the hypothalamus and the hypophyseal stalk. Postoperatively, vision improved and prolactin dropped to normal values, but hyponatremia persisted. Histopathological examination revealed a neuroblastoma with strong positivity for synaptophysin and chromogranin, MAP-2 protein and NeuN-antigen in the immunohistochemistry.

{"title": "A generic bioheat transfer thermal model for a perfused tissue.", "abstract": "A thermal model was needed to predict temperatures in a perfused tissue, which satisfied the following three criteria. One, the model satisfied conservation of energy. Two, the heat transfer rate from blood vessels to tissue was modeled without following a vessel path. Three, the model applied to any unheated and heated tissue. To meet these criteria, a generic bioheat transfer model (BHTM) was derived here by conserving thermal energy in a heated vascularized finite tissue and by making a few simplifying assumptions. Two linear coupled differential equations were obtained with the following two variables: tissue volume averaged temperature and blood volume averaged temperature. The generic model was compared with the widely employed empirical Pennes' BHTM. The comparison showed that the Pennes' perfusion term wC(p)(1-epsilon) should be interpreted as a local vasculature dependent heat transfer coefficient term.

Studies using 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and 50/10 OIR+SO models were reviewed. Repeated fluctuations in oxygen increased retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) even while peripheral avascular retina persisted and prior to the development of intravitreous neovascularization. Repeated fluctuations in oxygen increased VEGF(164) expression but not VEGF(120). Neutralizing VEGF bioactivity significantly reduced intravitreous neovascularization and arteriolar tortuosity without interfering with ongoing retinal vascularization. Repeated oxygen fluctuations led to retinal hypoxia and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibiting ROS with NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, reduced avascular retina by interfering with apoptosis. Supplemental oxygen reduced retinal VEGF concentration and exacerbated NADPH oxidase activation to contribute to intravitreous neovascularization through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Oxygen stresses relevant to those experienced by preterm infants today trigger signaling of different pathways to cause avascular retina and intravitreous neovascularization.

{"title": "Hemorheology and circulation.", "abstract": "The main functions of the blood are the transport, and delivery of oxygen and nutrients, removal of carbon dioxide and waste products of metabolism, distribution of heat and signals of immune system. They are provided by circulation due to the driving force of the heart. Circulation of the blood depends on its rheological properties of the blood as well as on characteristics of the vessels through which the blood passes. The blood flow resistance is influenced by the complicated architecture of the vascular network and flow behaviour of blood components - blood cells and plasma. The obtained data based on analysis of influences on blood flow are differentiated in the dependence on place and level of investigation.

{"title": "NOX and inflammation in the vascular adventitia.", "abstract": "Vascular inflammation has traditionally been thought to be initiated at the luminal surface and progress through the media toward the adventitial layer. In recent years, however, evidence has emerged suggesting that the vascular adventitia is activated early in a variety of cardiovascular diseases and that it plays an important role in the initiation and progression of vascular inflammation. Adventitial fibroblasts have been shown to produce substantial amounts of NAD(P)H oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to vascular injury. Additionally, inflammatory cytokines, lipids, and various hormones, implicated in fibroblast proliferation and migration, lead to recruitment of inflammatory cells to the adventitial layer and impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. Early in the development of vascular disease, there is clear evidence for progression toward a denser vasa vasorum which delivers oxygen and nutrients to an increasingly hypoxic and nutrient-deficient media. This expanded vascularization appears to provide enhanced delivery of inflammatory cells to the adventitia and outer media. Combined adventitial fibroblast and inflammatory cell-derived ROS therefore are expected to synergize their local effect on adventitial parenchymal cells, leading to further cytokine release and a feed-forward propagation of adventitial ROS production. In fact, data from our laboratory and others suggest a broader paracrine positive feedback role for adventitia-derived ROS in medial smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and neointimal hyperplasia. A likely candidate responsible for the adventitia-derived paracrine signaling across the vessel wall is the superoxide anion metabolite hydrogen peroxide, which is highly stable, cell permeant, and capable of activating downstream signaling mechanisms in smooth muscle cells, leading to phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. This review addresses the role of adventitial NAD(P)H oxidase-derived ROS from a nontraditional, perivascular vantage of promoting vascular inflammation and will discuss how ROS derived from adventitial NAD(P)H oxidases may be a catalyst for vascular remodeling and dysfunction.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2009-07-25", "authors": ["G\u00e1borCs\u00e1nyi", "W RobertTaylor", "Patrick JPagano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.07.022"}

Increased procoagulant tonus in high grade tumors (glioblastomas) also indicates a potential role for TF in progression of this disease, and suggests that anticoagulants could be used as adjuvants for its treatment.\nWe hypothesized that blocking of TF activity with the tick anticoagulant Ixolaris might interfere with glioblastoma progression.\nTF was identified in U87-MG cells by flow-cytometric and functional assays (extrinsic tenase). In addition, flow-cytometric analysis demonstrated the exposure of phosphatidylserine in the surface of U87-MG cells, which supported the assembly of intrinsic tenase (FIXa/FVIIIa/FX) and prothrombinase (FVa/FXa/prothrombin) complexes, accounting for the production of FXa and thrombin, respectively. Ixolaris effectively blocked the in vitro TF-dependent procoagulant activity of the U87-MG human glioblastoma cell line and attenuated multimolecular coagulation complexes assembly. Notably, Ixolaris inhibited the in vivo tumorigenic potential of U87-MG cells in nude mice, without observable bleeding. This inhibitory effect of Ixolaris on tumor growth was associated with downregulation of VEGF and reduced tumor vascularization.\nOur results suggest that Ixolaris might be a promising agent for anti-tumor therapy in humans.", "journal": "Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH", "date": "2009-07-25", "authors": ["T CCarneiro-Lobo", "SKonig", "D EMachado", "L ENasciutti", "M FForni", "I M BFrancischetti", "M CSogayar", "R QMonteiro"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1538-7836.2009.03553.x"}

One hundred thirty-four patients with pure ODG were included in this study. Multivariate analysis identified four independent poor prognostic factors: necrosis, absence of seizure, increased vascularization, and age >55 years. A subgroup of patients with tumor necrosis, increased vascularization, and absence of seizures had a significantly worse outcome than predicted, with a median overall survival of 14.2 months. VEGF expression was significantly higher in this subgroup and correlated with disease progression regardless of histologic grade.

The aim of the first procedure was to reduce the vascularization of the protruded mucosa by a circular series of interrupted mass stitches. This approach was successful and an important reduction of vascularization was obtained. The operation was then completed two weeks later, requiring a radical circular removal of the giant anal cushions and anal canal epithelium with subsequent mucocutaneous anastomosis. A careful submucosal dissection was performed to identify and preserve the anal sphincters. No normal perianal skin was available to preserve bridges between the resected cushions. At the end of the operation, an ectopic mucosa was apparent but gradual reduction was observed in subsequent postoperative days along with recovery of anal sphincter function, and the patient was uneventfully discharged on the seventh postoperative day. On the 30th postoperative day a normal anal canal closure was observed with no ectopic mucosa.

{"title": "Increased angiogenesis induced by chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells is mediated by leukemia-derived Ang2 and VEGF.", "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that angiogenic signalling pathways play important role in the patho-biology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our goal was to investigate: (i) the spontaneous and hypoxia-induced production of pro-angiogenic factors, VEGF and Ang2, by Real-time PCR and ELISA, (ii) the degree of vascularization in CLL-infiltrated bone marrow (BM) compartment by CD34 immunohistochemical staining of microvessels and (iii) the direct angiogenic effect of CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2 by function-blocking experiments in Matrigel assays. The results demonstrated that CLL cells spontaneously express both VEGF and Ang2 and are able to secrete these factors in surrounding microenvironment. Full-length Ang2 mRNA and truncated form Ang2(443) were detectable. Moreover, CLL cells were shown to enhance secretion of both VEGF and Ang2 proteins when subjected to hypoxic condition. Furthermore, increased in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis was induced by CLL cells. Enhanced BM vascularity correlated with Ig-unmutated CLL subset and increased expression of Ang2. Then, we demonstrated that supernatants obtained from CLL cells significantly increase the HUVEC tube formation in Matrigel assays and that this enhanced angiogenic capacity is mediated by both CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2. Taken together, these results suggest that several simultaneous mechanisms may be involved in the CLL capacity to induce the disruption of pre-existing vessel structures to give rise to tumor neoangiogenesis. The preliminary studies in solid tumors, showing that the disruption of Ang2 function can inhibit tumor vessel density and growth, are encouraging and suggest the possibility of new future therapeutic options targeting CLL microenvironment.", "journal": "Leukemia research", "date": "2009-07-21", "authors": ["RossanaMaffei", "SilviaMartinelli", "IlariaCastelli", "RitaSantachiara", "PatriziaZucchini", "MarcellaFontana", "StefaniaFiorcari", "GorettaBonacorsi", "FiorellaIlariucci", "GiuseppeTorelli", "RobertoMarasca"], "doi": "10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.023"}

We first investigated the number of microvessel and microcirculatory perfusion in untreated scars on days 10, 30, 60, and 90 after epithelialization. Then, we examined the effect of anti-angiogenesis by adenovirus-mediated METH1 expression on hypertrophic scar formation by calculating the scar elevation index, counting the microvessel and argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region particle, and detecting the amount of collagen on days 30 and 60 after treatment. We found that untreated scar tissues at the proliferative phase (days 10-60 after epithelialization) had a significantly higher density of microvessel and microcirculatory perfusion than those at the mature phase (day 90 after epithelization) (both p<0.05). On days 30 and 60 after treatment, the hypertrophic scar formation was significantly inhibited in the treatment group. There was significantly reduced scar elevation index, microvessel count, number of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region, and total collagen content for treated scars.

The tumors were implanted into the hind leg of Wistar rats. When the tumors reached 10-15mm, rhenium radiolabeled particles of 25microm and 0.3microm were percutaneously injected into the tumors: large particles (Re-188 microspheres) in 10 hypo- and 10 hypervascularized tumors and small particles (Re-186 sulfid colloid) in 4 hypo- and 16 hypervascularized tumors with the co-injection of the vasoconstrictor, adrenalin (0.01 mg), into 8 hypervascularized tumors. Tumor activity was measured with a gamma camera at 10 min, 1h, 3h, 6h, 14h and 48h p.i. In addition, activity in the lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lymph nodes was measured at 48 h p.i. Measurements were adjusted for decay times and then compared.\nDrainage of the injected particles is bi-phasic, characterized by a fast wash-out. At 10 min p.i., intratumoral activity decreases to 70% of the initially injected activity. This is followed by a slow decline at 48 h p.i in which intratumoral activity decreases to at least 60% of the initially injected activity. Slow decline is independent of particle size and vascularization, whereas fast leakage depends on both. Co-injecting adrenalin significantly reduced the wash-out of the small particles. Radiolabeled microspheres accumulated mainly in the lungs, smaller colloids in the liver.\nParticle stay time, biodistribution, and stability can be easily monitored as shown in this animal model.

In contrast, we observe a significant decrease in vascularization and an increase in fibrosis in the muscles transplanted with MDSCs expressing soluble forms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) (VEGF-specific antagonist) when compared to control MDSCs. Our results indicate that VEGF-expressing cells do not increase the number of dystrophin-positive fibers in the injected mdx muscle, when compared to the control MDSCs. Together the results suggest that the transplantation of VEGF-expressing MDSCs improved skeletal muscle repair through modulation of angiogenesis, regeneration and fibrosis in the injected mdx skeletal muscle.", "journal": "Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy", "date": "2009-07-16", "authors": ["Bridget MDeasy", "Joseph MFeduska", "Thomas RPayne", "YongLi", "FabrisiaAmbrosio", "JohnnyHuard"], "doi": "10.1038/mt.2009.136"}

In the case of recurrence, the overlying skin is usually involved and the reconstructive surgeon is confronted with exposed femoral vessels and complex groin defects. We report a series of 40 patients that underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy and immediate sartorius transposition for skin malignancies, and 4 patients with recurrence that was treated with radical surgical excision and pedicled anterolateral thigh flap (ATL). We examined complications such as infection, skin necrosis, lymphorea, lymphoedema, and wound healing time. The immediate sartorius transposition was associated with 7.5% infection rate, 5% superficial skin edge necrosis, 0% of persistent lymph, and 27.5% of mild lymphoedema. All ALT flaps survived completely and wounds healed uneventfully within 2 weeks without any signs of infection, seroma, or wound dehiscence.Sartorius and ALT flap are reliable methods to reconstruct the groin following inguinal lymphadenectomy.

A study employing more sensitive 13 MHz scanners has not been conducted so far.\nSix hundred and thirty-five consecutive patients (33% female, 67% male, mean 56.7 years) presenting for a preventive health check up underwent ultrasound screening of the thyroid gland (Siemens Acuson Antares, 13 MHz-linear scanner, B-mode and Power mode) and measurement of the basal TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) value. Size and degree of vascularization of the thyroid gland and of nodules were determined and analysed retrospectively.\nIn 432 of 635 patients, thyroid nodules could be detected with an increasing incidence with age, in 338 without goiter. Mean thyroid size was 12.3 mL for women and 20.5 mL for men correlating strongly with body weight. Fifty-three percentage of the nodules were smaller than 5 mm. Incidence of thyroid dysfunction was only 4%. No cancerous lesions could be found.\nUsing the 13 MHz technology, we found a substantially higher prevalence of thyroid nodules (68%) than the Papillon study (33%). Even if our population is older than in Papillon, the difference remains in comparable age groups. This is due to the higher sensitivity of 13 MHz scanning.

Early recognition of this paradigm suggested a potential and novel cancer treatment target that led to the discovery and implementation of antiangiogenic therapies. Two basic strategies of cancer antiangiogenic therapy have emerged, one targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF (growth factor ligand-based antagonists) and the second targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, VEGFR (receptor-based antagonists, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Emerging literature suggests efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy for recurrent HGG.\nNotwithstanding the limited literature regarding the treatment of recurrent HGG with antiangiogenic therapy (predominantly ligand-based and administered in conjunction with cytotoxic chemotherapy), this therapy has become the de facto standard of care for many. Response rates vary from 30-60% and 6-month progression free survival varies from 25-50%. Problematic however are new antiangiogenic class side effects (hypertension, fatigue, proteinuria, intratumoral hemorrhage, arterial thrombosis and wound dehiscence), timing in relationship to surgery, measurements of response, lack of established dose response relationships and pharmacoeconomics and a possible change in tumor biology.\nLigand-based antiangiogenic therapy (in particular bevacizumab) is a compelling new targeted therapy for HGG and will continue to emerge as an important novel anti-glioma therapy.

{"title": "Syndecan-1 is required for robust growth, vascularization, and metastasis of myeloma tumors in vivo.", "abstract": "Myeloma tumors are characterized by high expression of syndecan-1 (CD138), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan present on the myeloma cell surface and shed into the tumor microenvironment. High levels of shed syndecan-1 in the serum of patients are an indicator of poor prognosis, and numerous studies have implicated syndecan-1 in promoting the growth and progression of this cancer. In the present study we directly addressed the role of syndecan-1 in myeloma by stable knockdown of its expression using RNA interference. Knockdown cells that were negative for syndecan-1 expression became apoptotic and failed to grow in vitro. Knockdown cells expressing syndecan-1 at approximately 28% or approximately 14% of normal levels survived and grew well in vitro but formed fewer and much smaller subcutaneous tumors in mice compared with tumors formed by cells expressing normal levels of syndecan-1. When injected intravenously into mice (experimental metastasis model), knockdown cells formed very few metastases as compared with controls. This indicates that syndecan-1 may be required for the establishment of multi-focal metastasis, a hallmark of this cancer. One mechanism of syndecan-1 action occurs via stimulation of tumor angiogenesis because tumors formed by knockdown cells exhibited diminished levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and impaired development of blood vessels. Together, these data indicate that the effects of syndecan-1 on myeloma survival, growth, and dissemination are due, at least in part, to its positive regulation of tumor-host interactions that generate an environment capable of sustaining robust tumor growth.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2009-07-15", "authors": ["Yekaterina BKhotskaya", "YuemengDai", "Joseph PRitchie", "VeronicaMacLeod", "YangYang", "KurtZinn", "Ralph DSanderson"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M109.018473"}
{"title": "Liver cyst cytokines promote endothelial cell proliferation and development.", "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney (ADPKD) is highly prevalent genetic disease. Liver cyst disease is the most common extrarenal manifestation in ADPKD and accounts for up to 10% of ADPKD morbidity and mortality. The clinical features of ADPKD liver disease arise from dramatic increases in liver cyst volumes. To identify mechanisms that promote liver cyst growth, the present study characterized the degree of vascularization of liver cyst walls and determined that cyst-specific cytokines and growth factors can drive endothelial cell proliferation and development. Microscopic techniques demonstrated liver cyst walls are well vascularized. A comparative analysis found the vascular density in free liver cyst walls was greater in mice than in humans. Treatment of human micro-vascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) with human liver cyst fluid (huLCF) induced a rapid increase in vascular endothelium growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) phosphorylation that persisted for 45-60 min and was blocked by 20 microM SU5416, a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Similarly, huLCF treatment of HMEC-1 cells induced an increase in the cell proliferation rate (131 +/- 6% of control levels; P > 0.05) and the degree of vascular development ('tube' diameter assay: 92 +/- 14 microm for huLCF vs. 12 +/- 7 microm for vehicle); P > 0.05). Both cell proliferation and vascular development were sensitive to SU5416. These studies indicate that factors secreted by liver cyst epithelia can activate VEGF signaling pathways and induce endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation.

{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cells do not contribute to tumor endothelium in primary and metastatic tumors.", "abstract": "Despite extensive research, the contribution of bone-marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPC) to tumor angiogenesis remains controversial. In previous publications, the extent of incorporation of BM-EPCs into the endothelial cell (EC) layer in different tumor models has been reported as significant in some studies but undetectable in others. Here, we studied the differentiation of BM-EPCs and its contribution to tumor vessels in experimental and spontaneous lung metastasis (B16 melanoma and prostate carcinoma), in an autochthonous transgenic model of prostate tumorigenesis, in orthotopically implanted lung tumors [Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)], in heterotopic subcutaneous models (LLC and C1 prostate carcinoma) growing in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bone marrow (BM) chimeras. Immunofluorescence was performed with a set of endothelial and hematopoietic markers and confocal microscopy was used to generate 3D reconstruction images. By performing rigorously conducted morphological studies, we found no evidence of BM-EPCs differentiation into tumor endothelium independently of tumor type, grade and organ site in primary and metastatic tumors. The vast majority of GFP(+) cells were trafficking leucocytes or periendothelial myeloid cells. To explore the possibility that local overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) might increase the numbers of incorporated BM-EPCs, we analyzed tumors genetically manipulated to overexpress VEGF(164). Local VEGF production induces a massive infiltration of bone-marrow-derived cells, but did not lead to vessel wall integration of these cells.

In the present study, we analyzed the host tissue reaction to Prolene, Ultrapro, and Vicryl meshes over a 14-day period after implantation into the hamster dorsal skinfold chamber using intravital fluorescence microscopy and histology. Our results demonstrate that compared with the Prolene and Ultrapro mesh, the Vicryl mesh induced a more pronounced angiogenic and inflammatory host tissue response with formation of a densely vascularized granulation tissue, which was infiltrated by many inflammatory cells. However, the strong foreign body reaction was not associated with a better mesh incorporation, but resulted in a significantly reduced explantation strength when compared with that of Prolene and Ultrapro meshes. Histological examinations revealed that the granulation tissue surrounding the Vicryl mesh was instable, because of low collagen content and massive infiltration of inflammatory cells.

{"title": "Changes in cerebrospinal fluid nerve growth factor levels during chick embryonic development.", "abstract": "In the early stages of brain development, cells within the ependymal lining of the neural tube are thought to secrete cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the so-called neural tube fluid (NTF), whereas before fusion of the neural folds, the neuroepithelium that lines the inside of the neural tube is in contact with amniotic fluid. As the neural tube closes, a membrane formed from these cells invaginates to form the specialized choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a highly vascularized epithelial cell structure that secretes proteins, including growth factors, into the CSF. Embryonic CSF (e-CSF) contains high concentrations of proteins compared to adult CSF. CSF has been reported to contain nerve growth factor (NGF) and other neurotrophic factors. In this study, total protein concentration and NGF level in e-CSF samples from chick embryos were measured using a dye-based protein assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. The total protein concentration and NGF levels in the CSF decreased from days E10 to E16. There was a rapid increase in total protein content on days E17 and E18, and thereafter the levels decreased from day E19 to day E21. Days E17 and E18 coincide with the onset of neuron migration, proliferation and organization of the cytoarchitecture of the developing cerebral cortex. After that time the total protein concentration and NGF levels decrease until hatching. Since CSF is in contact with the cerebral cortical germinal epithelium, changes in the protein concentration in the CSF could affect neuroepithelial cell proliferation, survival and migration. It is concluded that NGF is not only a constant component of CSF during chick embryogenesis but it might also be involved in cerebral cortical development.", "journal": "Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "date": "2009-07-08", "authors": ["FarhadMashayekhi", "MajidAzari", "Lotfali MasomiMoghadam", "MeysamYazdankhah", "MohammadNaji", "ZivarSalehi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jocn.2009.03.023"}

A sufficient number of Langerhans islets capable of secretory activity need to be transplanted to maintain normoglycemia after the surgical procedure. In order to optimize all stages, including collection, storage, isolation and transplantation of pancreatic islets, a reproducible animal-based experimental model should be developed before a new method is introduced into clinical practice.\nThe aim of the present study was to develop a reproducible autogenic model-based method for collection, conservation and isolation of porcine pancreas so that transplantation of isolated pancreatic islets could be performed and postoperative normoglycemia achieved.\nPigs were subjected to total pancreatectomy with simultaneous splenectomy and without removal of the duodenum.

Reconstruction of the partial cystectomy site was performed using ECM scaffolds prepared from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) or porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM). Animals were randomly assigned to either a long-term catheterization (LTC) group (n=5, catheterized 28 d) or a short-term catheterization group (STC, n=5, catheterized 24 h), and scaffold remodeling was assessed by histologic methods at 4 and 12 wk postoperatively.

In contrast, at 4 wk the scaffolds in LTC animals were not epithelialized, and did not express neuronal markers. The scaffolds in the LTC group developed a dense granulation tissue containing SMA+, smMHC-, spindle-shaped cells that were morphologically and phenotypically consistent with myofibroblasts, but not smooth muscle cells.

In contrast, at 12 wk the scaffolds in LTC animals had a remodeling response more consistent with fibrosis even though catheters had been removed 8 wk earlier.

We report the development of an autologous tracheal substitute for long-segment tracheal resection that satisfies these criteria and demonstrates excellent short-term functional results in a large-animal study.\nTwelve adult pigs underwent long-segment (6 cm, 60% of total length) tracheal resection. Autologous costal cartilage strips measuring 6 cm x 2 mm were harvested from the chest wall and inserted at regular 0.5-cm intervals between dermal layers of a cervical skin flap. The neotrachea was then scaffolded by rotating the composite cartilage skin flap around a silicone stent measuring 6 cm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The neotrachea replaced the long segment of tracheal resection, and the donor flap site was closed with a double-Z plasty. Animals were killed at 1 week (group I, n = 4), 2 weeks (group II, n = 4), and 5 weeks (group III, n = 4). In group III the stent was removed 1 week before death. Viability of the neotrachea was monitored by means of daily flexible bronchoscopy and histologic examination at autopsy. Long-term morbidity and mortality were determined by monitoring weight gain, respiratory distress, and survival.\nThere was no mortality during the study period. Weight gain was appropriate in all animals. Daily bronchoscopy and postmortem histologic evaluation confirmed excellent viability of the neotrachea. There was no evidence of suture-line dehiscence. Five animals had distal granulomas that were removed by using rigid bronchoscopy. In group III 1 animal had tracheomalacia, which was successfully managed by means of insertion of a silicon stent.\nAirway reconstruction with autologous cervical skin flaps scaffolded with costal cartilages is a novel approach to replace long segments of resected trachea. This preliminary study demonstrates excellent respiratory function and survival in large animals undergoing resection of more than 50% of their native trachea. Use of cervical skin flaps buttressed with costal cartilage is a promising solution for long-segment tracheal replacement.", "journal": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "date": "2009-07-07", "authors": ["DominiqueFabre", "SunilSinghal", "VincentDe Montpreville", "BenoitDecante", "SachaMussot", "OlivierChataigner", "OlafMercier", "FredericKolb", "Philippe GDartevelle", "ElieFadel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.11.071"}

Four weeks later, these rabbits were euthanized, bilateral femora were dissected for micro-CT-based microangiography to assess vascularization, and then the osteonecrotic changes and repair processes were examined histopathologically.\nQuantitative analysis showed that new vessel formation in group III was significantly greater compared with other groups at 4 weeks after treatment.

Pups were given intravitreous injections of VEGFR2 inhibitor, SU5416, or control (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) and returned to oxygen cycling until p14, then placed into room air. Intravitreous neovascularization (IVNV), avascular/total retinal areas, and endothelial tip cell filopodial number and length were determined in lectin-labeled neurosensory retinal flat mounts. Cryosections or fresh tissue were analyzed for phospho-VEGFR1, phospho-VEGFR2, activated caspase-3, or phospho-beta3 integrin. Human umbilical venous (HUVECs) and human choroidal endothelial cells (ECs) were treated with VEGFR2 inhibitor to determine effect on VEGFR2 phosphorylation and on directed EC migration toward a VEGF gradient. Filopodial length and number of migrated ECs were also measured. Compared to control, the VEGFR2 inhibitor reduced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in HUVECs in vitro and clock hours and areas of IVNV but not percent avascular retina in vivo. Filopodial length and number of filopodia/EC tip cell were reduced in retinal flat mounts at doses that inhibited IVNV, whereas at lower doses, only a reduction in filopodial length/EC tip cell was found. There was no difference in phosphorylated beta3 integrin and cleaved caspase-3 labeling in VEGFR2 inhibitor-treated compared to control in vivo. Doses of the VEGFR2 inhibitor that reduced filopodial length and number of filopodia/migrating EC corresponded to reduced EC migration in in vitro models.

In vivo laser scanning confocal microscopic examinations were performed on the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal bulbar conjunctiva and the images were recorded. The morphology of bulbar conjunctiva was analyzed and the density of epithelial cells, dendritic cells and goblet cells were calculated. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the means of epithelial cell densities in different layers and goblet cell densities in different positions. Subsequently the datum between two groups were analyzed by least significant difference (LSD).\nSuperficial epithelial cells of bulbar conjunctiva were characterized as large loose-arranged cells with a hyporeflective nucleus. The mean density is (1643 +/- 206) cells/mm(2). Intermediate epithelial cells were captured with features of oval small tight-arranged cells with a punctiform hyperreflective nucleus.

Well-vascularized cover is required to restore function and appearance. The latissimus dorsi (LD) flap is commonly employed but its use affects glenohumeral function, which is undesirable in a patient with a shoulder weak from an underlying pathologic condition. We describe the extended lower trapezius (Tz) flap for reconstructing the shoulder tip defects of 3 patients. This pedicled flap is based on the dorsal scapular artery and includes the lower Tz muscle and a long inferior fasciocutaneous extension. All flaps healed without complications and all patients regained good shoulder function with full range of motion. One patient who developed tumor recurrence was treated with re-excision and LD flap reconstruction. The extended lower Tz flap based on the dorsal scapular artery is well suited for reconstructing shoulder defects. With its fasciocutaneous extension, it has a long arc of rotation that is able to reach the shoulder tip. Shoulder morbidity is low as only the lower Tz is detached, minimizing disruption to scapulothoracic function.

Flap prefabrication based on the neovascularization development following vascular pedicle implantation allows surgeons to create such flaps as required. Using different types of implanted vascular pedicles, the aim of the study was to identify the most effective and suitable types of pedicles for clinical use. Five models of implanted vascular pedicles in Chinchilla Bastard rabbits were investigated as follows: model 1, arteriovenous (AV) pedicle with end ligation (minimal blood flow in the implanted vascular pedicle); model 2, AV pedicle with end anastomosis (new shunt formation between vein and artery stump for creating maximal blood flow in the implanted vascular pedicle); model 3, purely isolated arterialized venous loop; model 4, purely isolated arterial loop; model 5, AV pedicle with end anastomosis (similar to model 2) combined with flap expansion. These different types of vascular pedicles were implanted into a random-pattern abdominal skin flap as large as 8 x 15 cm. Neovascularization in the various prefabricated flaps was evaluated macroscopically, scintigraphically, microangiographically, and histologically. A total of 150 prefabricated flaps were investigated and randomly assigned to 5 models with 30 flaps each. Each model contained 5 groups of 6 flaps corresponding to the various retention times of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 days after vascular pedicle implantation. Six flaps were also designated to the control group. Neovascularization was best in model 5, followed by comparable results for models 2, 3, and 4, with the worst results found in model 1, especially for the time intervals of 8, 12, and 16 days. Twenty days remains the minimal length of time required for matured neovascularization in all models (P < 0.05).

To address this question, we stably expressed the alpha6 integrin subunit in the U87 cell line via retroviral-mediated gene transfer. We show that cell surface expression of the alpha6beta1 integrin led to dramatic changes in tumor U87 cell behavior, both in vitro and in vivo. Nude mice receiving either subcutaneous or intracerebral inoculation of alpha6beta1-expressing cells developed substantially more voluminous tumors than mice injected with control cells. The difference in tumor growth was associated with a marked increase in vascularization in response to alpha6beta1 integrin expression and may also be related to changes in the balance between cell proliferation and survival. Indeed, expression of alpha6beta1 enhanced proliferation and decreased apoptosis of U87 cells both in the tumor and in vitro. Additionally, we demonstrate that alpha6beta1 is implicated in glioblastoma cell migration and invasion and that laminin-111 might mediate dissemination of alpha6beta1-positive cells in vivo.

Studies were therefore performed with PECAM-1-null mice to further define the involvement of PECAM-1 in blood vessel formation. Vascularization of subcutaneous Matrigel implants as well as tumor angiogenesis were both inhibited in PECAM-1-null mice. Reciprocal bone marrow transplants that involved both wild-type and PECAM-1-deficient mice revealed that the impaired angiogenic response resulted from a loss of endothelial, but not leukocyte, PECAM-1. In vitro wound migration and single-cell motility by PECAM-1-null endothelial cells were also compromised. In addition, filopodia formation, a feature of motile cells, was inhibited in PECAM-1-null endothelial cells as well as in human endothelial cells treated with either anti-PECAM-1 antibody or PECAM-1 siRNA. Furthermore, the expression of PECAM-1 promoted filopodia formation and increased the protein expression levels of Cdc42, a Rho GTPase that is known to promote the formation of filopodia. In the developing retinal vasculature, numerous, long filamentous filopodia, emanating from endothelial cells at the tips of angiogenic sprouts, were observed in wild-type animals, but to a lesser extent in the PECAM-1-null mice.

Various leukocytes, including macrophages, infiltrate endometriotic lesions. In this study, we depleted mouse macrophages by means of either clodronate liposomes or monoclonal antibodies before the injection of syngeneic endometrial tissue. In the absence of macrophages, tissue fragments adhered and implanted into the peritoneal wall, but endometriotic lesions failed to organize and develop. When we depleted macrophages after the establishment of endometriotic lesions, blood vessels failed to reach the inner layers of the lesions, which stopped growing. Macrophages from patients with endometriosis and experimental mice, but not nonendometriotic patients who underwent surgery for uterine leiomyomas or control mice, expressed markers of alternative activation. These markers included high levels of scavenger receptors, CD163 and CD206, which are involved in both the scavenging of hemoglobin with iron transfer into macrophages and the silent clearance of inflammatory molecules. Macrophages in both inflammatory liquid and ectopic lesions were equally polarized, suggesting a critical role of environmental cues in the peritoneal cavity. Adoptively transferred, alternatively activated macrophages dramatically enhanced endometriotic lesion growth in mice. Inflammatory macrophages effectively protected mice from endometriosis.

We find that this distinct Shh target field that adjoins a germinal zone, the lower rhombic lip (LRL), functions as a progenitor domain by contributing directly to the hChPe. By conditional Shh mutant analysis, we show that Shh signaling regulates hChPe progenitor proliferation and hChPe expansion through late embryonic development, starting around E12.5. Whereas previous studies show that direct contribution to the hChPe by the LRL ceases around E14, our findings reveal a novel tissue-autonomous role for Shh production and signaling in driving the continual growth and expansion of the hindbrain choroid plexus throughout development.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2009-07-03", "authors": ["XiHuang", "TatianaKetova", "Jonathan TFleming", "HaibinWang", "Sudhansu KDey", "YingLitingtung", "ChinChiang"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.033795"}

This article presents the authors' approach to one-stage reconstruction of composite soft-tissue defects using an anterolateral thigh flap with a vascularized fascia lata.\nThis retrospective review analyzed 973 patients who had undergone anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction for various soft-tissue defects over the past 10 years. Various types of complicated defects in 36 patients were reconstructed with a composite anterolateral thigh flap combined with vascularized fascia lata. The fascia lata component of the flap was used for abdominal wall and fascial defect reconstruction in 12 patients, for lip-cheek defect reconstruction in 15 patients, for reconstruction of composite defects in extremities in nine patients, and for reconstruction of the perineum in one patient. Functional outcomes of donor sites were investigated by using a dynamometer.\nAll flaps except one survived. The overall flap survival rate was 97 percent. Patients achieved satisfactory results without major postoperative complications. The study revealed that vascularized fascia may mimic a fascial sheath but lacks the muscle-synchronized excursion properties. Apart from a mild deficiency in quadriceps femoris muscles contraction in the donor thighs, no difficulties in daily ambulation were reported by the patients.\nThe anterolateral thigh flap with vascularized fascia lata provides a reliable fascial component for single-stage reconstruction of complex soft-tissue defects.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2009-07-02", "authors": ["Yur-RenKuo", "Ming-ChungYeh", "Hsiang-ShunShih", "Chien-ChangChen", "Pao-YuanLin", "Yuan-ChangChiang", "Seng-FengJeng"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181a80594"}

Fluorescence differential path length spectroscopy (FPDS) determines chromophore concentration based on the fluorescence intensity corrected for absorption. The concentration of the photosensitizer m-THPC (Foscan) was studied in vivo in normal rat liver, which is highly vascularized and therefore highly absorbing. Concentration estimates of m-THPC measured by FDPS on the liver are compared with chemical extraction. Twenty-five rats were injected with 0.3 mg kg m-THPC. In vivo optical concentration measurements were performed on tissue 3, 24, 48, and 96 h after m-THPC administration to yield a 10-fold variation in tissue concentration. After the optical measurements, the liver was harvested for chemical extraction. FDPS showed good correlation with chemical extraction. FDPS also showed a correlation between m-THPC fluorescence and blood volume fraction at the two shortest drug-light intervals. This suggests different compartmental localization of m-THPC for different drug-light intervals that can be resolved using fluorescence spectroscopy. Differences in measured m-THPC concentration between FDPS and chemical extraction are related to the interrogation volume of each technique; approximately 0.2 mm(3) and approximately 10(2) mm(3), respectively.

{"title": "Syncytin-A knockout mice demonstrate the critical role in placentation of a fusogenic, endogenous retrovirus-derived, envelope gene.", "abstract": "In most mammalian species, a key process of placenta development is the fusion of trophoblast cells into a highly specialized, multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast layer, through which most of the maternofetal exchanges take place. Little is known about this process, despite the recent identification of 2 pairs of envelope genes of retroviral origin, independently acquired by the human (syncytin-1 and syncytin-2) and mouse (syncytin-A and syncytin-B) genomes, specifically expressed in the placenta, and with in vitro cell-cell fusion activity. By generating knockout mice, we show here that homozygous syncytin-A null mouse embryos die in utero between 11.5 and 13.5 days of gestation. Refined cellular and subcellular analyses of the syncytin-A-deficient placentae disclose specific disruption of the architecture of the syncytiotrophoblast-containing labyrinth, with the trophoblast cells failing to fuse into an interhemal syncytial layer. Lack of syncytin-A-mediated trophoblast cell fusion is associated with cell overexpansion at the expense of fetal blood vessel spaces and with apoptosis, adding to the observed maternofetal interface structural defects to provoke decreased vascularization, inhibition of placental transport, and fetal growth retardation, ultimately resulting in death of the embryo. These results demonstrate that syncytin-A is essential for trophoblast cell differentiation and syncytiotrophoblast morphogenesis during placenta development, and they provide evidence that genes captured from ancestral retroviruses have been pivotal in the acquisition of new, important functions in mammalian evolution.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2009-07-01", "authors": ["AnneDupressoir", "C\u00e9cileVernochet", "OliviaBawa", "FrancisHarper", "G\u00e9rardPierron", "PauleOpolon", "ThierryHeidmann"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0902925106"}

These leucocyte populations are recruited to tumours by chemotactic factors released by either viable or necrotic tumour cells, or by cells within the tumour stroma. In recent times, most studies have analysed the role that tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) have on tumour progression. However, there is now increasing evidence to show that neutrophils also actively participate in this process. Whilst there are some data to suggest that neutrophil-derived factors can promote genetic mutations leading to tumourigenesis, or secrete factors that promote tumour cell proliferation; there is now substantial evidence to show that neutrophils, like TAM, significantly affect tumour angiogenesis. In this review, we discuss the likely mechanisms by which neutrophils are recruited into the tumour and then elaborate on how these cells may induce tumour vascularization by the secretion of powerful pro-angiogenic factors.

A mid-term (4 weeks) cardiomyocyte-specific enhancement was associated with elevated vascular density around the graft and attenuated compensatory remodeling. However, increasing the number of hESC-CM for injection did not enhance heart function further. Moreover, we observed that small graft size was associated with a better functional outcome.

Ninety days after surgery, the orbits were exenterated and four animals underwent histologic evaluation and the other four animals tensile strength testing of the muscle-sphere attachment.\nThere were no exposures or infections of the implants and the muscles remained attached in all cases. Histologic examination showed fibrous tissue reaction at the muscle-sphere attachment with minimal inflammation of the surrounding tissues; a pseudocapsule formation around the spheres and full vascularization of the implant was also observed. There was no evidence of residual glue on histologic examination. Tensile strength testing showed that rupture force was similar between bonded muscle and the porous polyethylene sphere.\nThe 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate did not cause deleterious effects in orbital tissues and provided strong adhesion between muscles and spheres.

Limitations of CEUS are its inability to characterize lesions distant to the applicator.

Herein we explored whether transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) allowed a reduced number of pancreatic islets to improve glycemic control in diabetic rats, by promoting islet vascularization. We transplanted 2000 syngenic islets alone or in combination with MSCs (10(6) cells) under the kidney capsules of diabetic Lewis rats. Animals transplanted with 2000 islets never reached normoglycemia. In contrast, rats transplanted with 2000 islets plus MSCs, showed a gradual fall in glycemia after transplantation, with normoglycemia maintained until killing. Comparable glycemic control was obtained with transplantation of 3000 islets alone. The MSC preparation used for in vivo experiments expressed high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) and, at less extent, VEGF(189), as evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In transplanted animals, vascularization was quantified by morphometric analysis of islet grafts with anti-RECA and anti-insulin antibodies. MSCs were stained with PKH-26. Mean capillary density was 1002 +/- 55 capillaries/mm(2) in islets transplanted alone. Co-infusion of MSCs with islets significantly increased the number of capillaries to 1459 +/- 66 capillaries/mm(2).

The patients were clinically classified into 4 stages (1, 2a, 2b, and 3).

Immediately after examination, patients underwent surgery, and the results from imaging were compared with the morphological analysis of the histologic grading. Fourteen patients had G2 tumors, and seven patients had G3 tumors. Significantly higher perfusion values (p<0.05) were obtained in G3 tumors than in G2 tumors when the entire tumor area was considered (1.59+/-0.44(ml/g/min) vs. 1.08+/-0.38(ml/g/min)) or its most highly vascularized part (2.14+/-0.89(ml/g/min) vs. 1.40+/-0.49(ml/g/min)).

Endogenous cannabinoids have been shown to inhibit proliferation of a wide spectrum of tumor cells. We studied the effects of cannabinoids on human Kaposi's sarcoma cell proliferation in vitro. To do so, we first investigated the presence of the cannabinoid receptors CB(1) and CB(2) mRNAs in the human Kaposi's sarcoma cell line KS-IMM by RT-PCR and, subsequently, the effects of the mixed CB(1)/CB(2) agonist WIN-55,212-2 (WIN) on cell proliferation in vitro. WIN showed antimitogenic effects on Kaposi's sarcoma cells. Western blot analysis of Kaposi's sarcoma lysates suggested that WIN treatment induced activation of both caspase-3 and -6, as well as increased phosphorylation of the stress kinase p38 and JNK, along with transient phosphorylation of ERK(1/2). To better characterize the involvement of each single CB receptor in cannabinoid-induced cell death, we incubated Kaposi's sarcoma cells with different selective cannabinoid receptor agonists, respectively ACEA (CB(1)) and JWH-133 (CB(2)).

These experiments tested a functional role for IL-6 in chronic rejection by utilizing serial echocardiography to assess the progression of chronic rejection in vascularized mouse cardiac allografts. Cardiac allografts in mice transiently depleted of CD4+ cells that develop chronic rejection were compared with those receiving anti-CD40L therapy that do not develop chronic rejection. Echocardiography revealed the development of hypertrophy in grafts undergoing chronic rejection. Histologic analysis confirmed hypertrophy that coincided with graft fibrosis and elevated intragraft expression of IL-6. To elucidate the role of IL-6 in chronic rejection, cardiac allograft recipients depleted of CD4+ cells were treated with neutralizing anti-IL-6 mAb. IL-6 neutralization ameliorated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, graft fibrosis, and prevented deterioration of graft contractility associated with chronic rejection.

Vascular targeted therapy exploits this basic need, along with molecular heterogeneity observed between normal and tumor blood vessels, to develop efficient and selective chemotherapies that essentially starve tumors by destroying their vasculature. As the basic principle on which this therapy is based differs from agents that directly target cancerous cells, combining it with traditional therapies such as radiation, surgery and existing chemotherapies has the potential to create powerful new anticancer strategies. As the requirement for vascularization is universal to solid tumors, vascular targeted therapies have the potential for broad applicability. Vascular targeted therapies include both angiogenesis inhibitors, which inhibit neovascularization, and vascular disrupting agents, which destroy existing vasculature. Applications of this model include finding peptides that bind specifically to cell surface markers on tumor vessel endothelial cells and might deliver chemotherapeutic agents.

Many different microvascular bone grafts are used to reduce wound healing complications at the severely compromised recipient site. The loss of primary grafts due to radiotherapy or osteoradionecrosis can make secondary mandibular reconstruction necessary. To address this problem, we developed the technique of the prefabrication of a radial forearm flap with cancellous bone. The aims were to establish these techniques into the clinical routine and to create a safe and reliable flap with low donor site morbidity.\nIn patients who had undergone ablative tumor surgery radiochemotherapy, and primary reconstruction, prefabricated bony radial forearm flaps (PBRFFs) were applied for secondary reconstruction of the mandible. Cylinders of cancellous bone taken from the iliac crest were implanted in the lower forearm to allow the necessary vascularization. After a healing period of 4 weeks, the PBRFF was elevated and grafted into the mandibular defect.\nAll grafts healed uneventfully. However, 1 case required revision of the venous anastomosis after 2 days. The transplants improved the contour of the lower face enabling a good correction of the facial asymmetry. During the follow-up of up to 4 years, the radiographic controls showed good bony consolidation between the graft and the stumps of the mandible as well as formation of cortical bone around the cancellous bone cylinders.\nThese results demonstrate that the PBRFF is a safe and reliable graft which provides alternate solution in which other microvascular bone grafts have already failed.

{"title": "The effect of implantation on scaffoldless three-dimensional engineered bone constructs.", "abstract": "Our laboratory has previously developed scaffoldless engineered bone constructs (EBC). Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) were harvested from rat femur and cultured in medium that induced osteogenic differentiation. After reaching confluence, the monolayer of cells contracted around two constraint points forming a cylinder. EBCs were placed in small diameter (0.5905 x 0.0625 in.) or large diameter (0.5905 x 0.125 in.) silicone tubing and implanted intramuscularly in the hind limb of a rat. Bone mineral content (BMC) of the EBC was analyzed before implantation and at 1 and 2 mo following implantation and compared to that of native femur bone at different stages of development. Negligible BMC was observed in E-20 femur or EBCs prior to implantation. One-month implantation in both small and large tubing increased BMC in the EBC. BMC of EBC from large tubing was greater than in 14 d rat neonatal femurs, but was 2% and 3% of BMC content in adult bone after 1 and 2 mo of implantation, respectively. Alizarine Red and osteopontin staining of the EBCs before and after implantation confirmed increased bone mineralization in the implanted EBCs. Implanted EBCs also had extensive vascularization. Our data suggest that BMSC can be successfully used for the generation of scaffoldless EBC, and this model can be potentially used for the generation of autologous bone transplants in humans.", "journal": "In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

{"title": "CD151 regulates tumorigenesis by modulating the communication between tumor cells and endothelium.", "abstract": "The tetraspanin CD151 forms stoichiometric complexes with laminin-binding integrins (e.g., alpha3beta1, alpha6beta1, and alpha6beta4) and regulates their ligand-binding and signaling functions. We have found that high expression of CD151 in breast cancers is associated with decreased overall survival (3.44-fold higher risk of death). Five-year estimated survival rates were 45.8% (95% confidence interval, 16.4-71.4%) for CD151-positive patients and 79.9% (95% confidence interval, 62.2-90.0%) for CD151-negative patients. Furthermore, CD151 was positively associated with axillary lymph node involvement. To study the biological significance of this observation, we investigated the contribution of CD151 in breast cancer tumorigenesis using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model system. Stable down-regulation of this tetraspanin by short-hairpin RNA decreased the tumorigenicity of these cells in mice. Detailed immunohistologic analysis of CD151(+) and CD151(-) xenografts showed differences in tumor vascular pattern. Vascularization observed at the subcutaneous border of the CD151(+) tumors was less pronounced or absent in the CD151(-) xenografts. In vitro experiments have established that depletion of CD151 did not affect the inherent proliferative capacity of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional extracellular matrices, but modified their responses to endothelial cells in coculture experiments. The modulatory activity of CD151 was dependent on its association with both alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrins. These data point to a new role of CD151 in tumorigenesis, whereby it functions as an important regulator of communication between tumor cells and endothelial cells. These results also identify CD151 as a potentially novel prognostic marker and target for therapy in breast cancer.", "journal": "Molecular cancer research : MCR", "date": "2009-06-18", "authors": ["RafalSadej", "HannaRomanska", "GouriBaldwin", "KaterinaGkirtzimanaki", "VeraNovitskaya", "Andrew DFiler", "ZuzanaKrcova", "RenataKusinska", "JiriEhrmann", "Christopher DBuckley", "RadzislawKordek", "PiotrPotemski", "Aristides GEliopoulos", "El-NasirLalani", "FedorBerditchevski"], "doi": "10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0574"}

The purpose of this study is to evaluate our experience with the use of both free flaps in the reconstruction of oral cavity defects after tumoral ablation.\nOver a 9-year period, 103 consecutive patients were treated in our department for the reconstruction of oral defects after tumor ablation by means of microvascularized free flaps. A total of 55 patients underwent reconstruction using RFFFs; 42 patients underwent reconstruction using VFFFs with or without skin paddles. Patients were treated for benign (n = 15) and malignant (n = 82) entities. All but 7 patients received donor site covering with abdominal full-thickness skin grafts.\nOf the 55 patients who received RFFFs, 5 (9.09%) developed necrosis at the end of the postsurgical period, and 7 patients developed complications of the donor site. Of the 42 patients who received VFFFs, an overall flap survival rate of 92.85% was achieved, and complications at the donor site occurred in 5 patients. For both free flaps, anesthesia time lasted from 6 to 15 hours (mean, 9.57 hours), whereas the mean flap ischemic time was 82.86 minutes.\nOur results reveal that the RFFF is a reliable method for reconstructing a wide range of oral cavity defects with an acceptably low morbidity rate. It provides adequate bulk and pliability, enabling the reconstruction of a wide variety of locations within the oral cavity.

In order to assess the thyroid function after exposure to PCBs and investigate whether PCBs induce autoimmune process in the thyroid gland, we determined the levels of serum thyroid hormones (FT3, FT4, and T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) in Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a commercial mixture of PCBs, Aroclor 1,254 (PCBs group), or the antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil (PTU group). The histopathology of the thyroid was also examined. Serum FT3, FT4, and T4 concentrations were significantly reduced, while TSH values were dramatically increased in PCBs group and PTU group compared with control rats (p < 0.05). TPOAb levels were significantly elevated in PCBs-treated rats (p < 0.05) but not in PTU group (p > 0.05). In contrast to the controls, treatment with PCBs lead to distinct histopathological changes in the thyroid gland, such as hyperplasia of the epithelia in follicles, colloid content reduction, vascularization, and lymphocytic infiltration in the perifollicular areas, whereas the major changes in the thyroid in PTU-treated rats were follicles shrinkage or collapse and colloid content reduction compatible with induced hypothyroidism.

A negative ulnar variance is considered as a predisposing factor for Kienb\u00f6ck's disease by the majority of the authors. The treatment depends upon the stage of the disease at the time of presentation and diagnosis. Radial shortening and lengthening of the ulna are biomechanically satisfactory procedures because they increase the load sharing of the ulna and result in decompression of the lunate. Revascularization of the lunate by shortening of the radius may appear to be a very bold and ambitious technique. In very advanced cases, palliative procedures like wrist denervation, resection of the proximal carpal row, or wrist arthrodesis are the techniques resorted to.

This substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial compared the effects of an amlodipine-based regimen (373 patients) with an atenolol-based regimen (347 patients) on retinal microvascular measurements made from fundus photographs. The retinal photographs were taken at a stage in the trial when treatments were stable and blood pressure was well controlled.

The association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, smoking, and statin treatment. This effect appeared to be largely attributable to shorter retinal arteriolar segment lengths in the amlodipine-treated group and is best explained by the vasodilator effects of amlodipine causing the visible emergence of branching side vessels.

A transgenic mouse model mediating inducible macrophage depletion during skin repair has not been used to date to address this question. Here, we specifically rendered the monocyte/macrophage leukocyte lineage sensitive to diphtheria toxin by expressing the lysozyme M promoter-driven, Cre-mediated excision of a transcriptional STOP cassette from the simian DT receptor gene in mice (lysM-Cre/DTR). Application of diphtheria toxin to lysM-Cre/DTR mice led to a rapid reduction in both skin tissue and wound macrophage numbers at sites of injury. Macrophage-depleted mice revealed a severely impaired wound morphology and delayed healing. In the absence of macrophages, wounds were re-populated by large numbers of neutrophils. Accordingly, macrophage-reduced wound tissues exhibited the increased and prolonged persistence of macrophage inflammatory protein-2, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1beta, and cyclooxygenase-2, paralleled by unaltered levels of bioactive transforming growth factor-beta1. Altered expression patterns of vascular endothelial growth factor on macrophage reduction were associated with a disturbed neo-vascularization at the wound site. Impaired wounds revealed a loss of myofibroblast differentiation and wound contraction.

{"title": "[Apelin signalisation and vascular physiopathology].", "abstract": "The formation of the vascular system is an early step in organogenesis that involves the participation of various signalling pathways. Integration of the extracellular signals decoded by their cognate membrane receptors orchestrate the cell events, which act at different stages, from the primitive network formed by vasculogenesis to the arborescent network remodeled by angiogenesis. Our laboratory showed the participation of a new signalling pathway in physiological angiogenesis and tumour neovascularisation. This signalling pathway named apelin comprises a G protein-coupled receptor and a peptide ligand. Expression of apelin receptors is observed during the embryonic formation of blood vessels where it is localized in the endothelium. In HUVECs, which endogenously express apelin receptors, apelin promotes the phosphorylation of ERKs, Akt and p70 S6 Kinase. In addition, apelin increases in vitro the proliferation of these endothelial cells. Finally, injection of apelin in the vitreous induces in vivo the sprouting and the proliferation of endothelial cells from the retinal vascular network. Accordingly, all these results led us to study the role of apelin signalling in tumour neovascularisation. In two tumoral cell lines, we showed that hypoxia induces the expression of apelin gene. In addition, the overexpression of apelin gene resulting from stable transfection of these cell lines clearly accelerates in vivo tumour growth, as a consequence of an increased number of vessels irrigating these tumours. The pathological relevance of these data has been validated by the characterization of an overexpression of apelin gene in one third of human tumours. Taken together, apelin signalling is both involved in physiological angiogenesis and pathological neoangiogenesis, and therefore represents an interesting pharmacological target for anti-angiogenic therapies.", "journal": "Journal de la Societe de biologie", "date": "2009-06-17", "authors": ["BernardMasri", "Lo\u00efcvan den Berghe", "CarolineSorli", "BernardKnibiehler", "YvesAudigier"], "doi": "10.1051/jbio/2009021"}

The animals were sacrificed on different time points, during and after O(2) exposure. After intracardial perfusion with FITC-dextran, retinal flatmounts were prepared, and the size of the retinal vascular network, the size of the central avascular area, and the number of blood vessel tufts and clusters were determined. In addition to the fluorescein stain for perfused capillaries, endothelial cells were stained with isolectin.\nUpon O(2) exposure, there is a rapid depletion of capillaries starting adjacent to the large central arteries. These avascular stripes fuse to form an avascular central area which amounts to 37% of the whole retinal surface after 2 days of hyperoxia. The peripheral capillary network remains intact throughout the incubation period, even though the pace of its centrifugal spreading is decelerated compared to room air controls. Already during O(2) exposure, revascularisation of the central avascular area is initiated by peripheral vessels sprouting in a centripetal direction. Revascularisation is accelerated after the return to room air, and is completed at P25. Maximal pathological neovascularisation can be found at P17, at the border between the avascular and vascular retina.\nHyperoxia leads to a rapid development of a central avascular area of the retina, with its maximum during not at the end of the hyperoxic phase. Central capillary loss and peripheral vascularisation take place simultaneously, indicating different cellular control mechanisms for different areas of the retina.

Sunitinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is reportedly effective for the treatment of various solid cancers. Its use in adnexal carcinomas has never been reported.\nThe first patient had metastatic clear cell hidradenocarcinoma and was stabilized over 8 months with sunitinib, before she relapsed. The second patient had a metastatic malignant hair follicle tumour (trichoblastic carcinoma) and achieved a partial remission with sunitinib, and disease stabilized after 10 months. Dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) performed to evaluate tumour vascularization during treatment depicted a dramatic and early decrease in the tumour blood volume.\nSunitinib was effective in controlling the disease in our two patients.

{"title": "Matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) is a new bone renal hormone and vascularization modulator.", "abstract": "Increased matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) expression occurs in several phosphate and bone-mineral metabolic disorders. To resolve whether MEPE plays a role, we created a murine model overexpressing MEPE protein (MEPE tgn) in bone. MEPE tgn mice displayed a growth and mineralization defect with altered bone-renal vascularization that persisted to adulthood. The growth mineralization defect was due to a decrease in bone remodeling, and MEPE tgn mice were resistant to diet-induced renal calcification. MEPE protein-derived urinary ASARM peptides and reduced urinary Ca X PO4 product mediated the suppressed renal calcification. Osteoblastic cells displayed reduced activity but normal differentiation. Osteoclastic precursors were unable to differentiate in the presence of osteoblasts. In the kidney, NPT2a up-regulation induced an increase in phosphate renal reabsorption, leading to hyperphosphatemia. We conclude MEPE and MEPE-phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (MEPE-PHEX) interactions are components to an age-diet-dependent pathway that regulates bone turnover and mineralization and suppresses renal calcification.

Twenty-four patients (mean age, 20 years) were treated for severely crushed proximal stumps with a replantable distal part (zones 1 and 2a). In this method, after a successful ectopic transplantation, the transplanted part is transferred to the original site not as a free tissue transfer but as a pedicle flap in which the transplanted finger is piggybacked to the groin flap and then the composite tissue (groin and finger) is transferred to the stump. After a waiting period of 3 to 4 weeks, the flap is severed sequentially or in 1 setting. Graft take, complications, sensitivity, patient satisfaction, and demographic data of the patients were evaluated.Graft take was 75% in the first stage and 100% in the second stage. There were no cases of infection, and minor complications such as edema subsided with time. Distal finger amputations have the best indication for replantation. A Pearson Educational Measurement score was obtained from the patients who participated in 6-month and 1-year follow-ups, and at the end of 1 year, 85% of the patients scored above 45 points. Eighty-seven percent of the patients were satisfied with their results and stated they would choose this procedure again if indicated and also would recommend it to other patients.The piggyback method of transfer of the ectopic single-finger transplantation has simplified the arduous and risky second-stage transfer to a low-risk and highly successful operation. The advantages include a less bulky tissue transfer, no severed major artery, and 2 short surgical procedures replacing 1 lengthy, potentially risky free vascularized procedure. The only drawback of this technique is the 3-week waiting period for the pedicle flap, wherein the hand is attached to the groin.

To characterise the vascularisation of teratocarcinomas, which arise after cell transplant, we used immunohistochemistry, together with a qualitative and quantitative analysis of scanning electron microscopy images of corrosion casting samples.\nEmbryonic stem cells transplanted into seminiferous tubules did not differentiate into germinal cells, but rather they behaved as invasive embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells.

An adequate vasculature feeds tumor growth and enhances the potential of metastasis. For many years, tumor vessels were thought to be lined exclusively by endothelial cells (ECs). However, therapeutic benefits from the promising antiangiogenic strategy targeting genetically stable ECs are frequently limited by the development of resistance, implying an oversimplified view of tumor vasculature. In fact, latest studies have revealed that in addition to ECs, other cells including bone marrow-derived and plastic tumor cells do contribute to tumor vascularization, which is also indicated in ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecologic malignancy characterized by widespread metastases within the peritoneal cavity upon diagnosis. Given the principle that tumor progression and metastasis are dependent on a persistent blood supply, it is logical that the capability of generating neovessels through diverse mechanisms of ovarian cancer is associated with its malignant potential.

{"title": "Tumor-associated macrophages infiltrate plasmacytomas and can serve as cell carriers for oncolytic measles virotherapy of disseminated myeloma.", "abstract": "In multiple myeloma, some of the neoplastic plasma cells are diffusely dispersed among the normal bone marrow cells (bone marrow resident), whereas others are located in discrete, well-vascularized solid tumors (plasmacytomas) that may originate in bone or soft tissue. Interactions between bone marrow-resident myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are important determinants of myeloma pathogenesis. However, little is known of the factors sustaining myeloma growth and cell viability at the centers of expanding plasmacytomas, where there are no BMSCs. Histologic sections of 22 plasmacytomas from myeloma patients were examined after immunostaining. Abundant CD68+, CD163+, S100-negative macrophage infiltrates were identified in all tumors, accompanied by scattered collections of CD3+ T lymphocytes. The CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) accounted for 2-12% of nucleated cells and were evenly distributed through the parenchyma. The TAM generally had dendritic morphology, and each dendrite was in close contact with multiple plasma cells. In some cases, the TAM were strikingly clustered around CD34+ blood vessels. To determine whether cells of the monocytic lineage might be exploitable as carriers for delivery of therapeutic agents to plasmacytomas, primary human CD14+ cells were infected with oncolytic measles virus and administered intravenously to mice bearing KAS6/1 human myeloma xenografts. The cell carriers localized to KAS6/1 tumors, where they transferred MV infection to myeloma cells and prolonged the survival of mice bearing disseminated human myeloma disease. Thus, TAM are a universal stromal component of the plasmacytomas of myeloma patients and may offer a promising new target for therapeutic exploitation. Am. J. Hematol. 2009.

{"title": "Chondrogenic priming of human bone marrow stromal cells: a better route to bone repair?", "abstract": "The use of bioengineered cell constructs for the treatment of bone defects has received much attention of late. Often, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are used that are in vitro-stimulated toward the osteogenic lineage, aiming at intramembranous bone formation. The success of this approach has been disappointing. A major concern with these constructs is core degradation and necrosis caused by lack of vascularization. We hypothesized that stimulation of cells toward the endochondral ossification process would be more successful. In this study, we tested how in vitro priming of human BMSCs (hBMSCs) along osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages influences survival and osteogenesis in vivo. Scaffolds that were pre-cultured on chondrogenic culture medium showed collagen type II and collagen type X production. Moreover, vessel ingrowth was observed. Priming along the osteogenic lineage led to a mineralized matrix of poor quality, with few surviving cells and no vascularization. We further characterized this process in vitro using pellet cultures. In vitro, pellets cultured in chondrogenic medium showed progressive production of collagen type II and collagen type X. In the culture medium of these chondrogenic cultured pellets, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release was observed at days 14, 21, and 35. When pellets were switched to culture medium containing beta-glycerophosphate, independent of the presence or absence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), mineralization was observed with a concomitant reduction in VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) release. By showing that VEGF and MMPs are produced in chondrogenically differentiated hBMSCs in vitro, we demonstrated that these cells produce factors that are known to be important for the induction of vascularization of the matrix. Inducing mineralization in this endochondral process does, however, severely diminish these capacities. Taken together, these data suggest that optimizing chondrogenic priming of hBMSCs may further improve vessel invasion in bioengineered constructs, thus leading to an alternative and superior approach to bone repair.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Most of the cortical changes thus induced occur during what is called the critical period. Astrocytes play an important role in the development, maintenance and plasticity of the cortex as well as in the structure and function of the vascular network. Visual deprivation induces a decrease in the astroglial population, whereas enhanced experience increases it. Exposure to an enriched environment has been shown to prevent the effects of dark-rearing in the visual cortex. Our purpose was to study the effects of an enriched environment on the density of astrocytes per reference surface at the visual cortex of dark-reared rats, in order to determine if enhanced experience is able to compensate the quantitative effects of visual deprivation and the role of physical exercise on the enrichment paradigm. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were raised in one of the following rearing conditions: control rats with standard housing (12-h light/dark cycle); in total darkness for the dark-rearing experiments; and dark-rearing in conditions of enriched environment without and with physical exercise. The astrocytic density was estimated by immunohistochemistry for S-100beta protein. Quantifications were performed in layer IV. The somatosensorial cortex barrel field was also studied as control. The volume of layer IV was stereologically calculated for each region, age and experimental condition. From the beginning of the critical period, astrocyte density was higher in control rats than in the enriched environment group without physical exercise, with densities of astrocytes around 20% higher at all of the different ages. In contrast, when the animals had access to voluntary exercise, densities were significantly higher than even the control rats. Our main result shows that strategies to apply environmental enrichment should always consider the incorporation of physical exercise, even for sensorial areas such as the visual area, where complex enriched experience by itself is not enough to compensate the effects of visual deprivation.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2009-06-09", "authors": ["Enrike GArgando\u00f1a", "HarkaitzBengoetxea", "Jos\u00e9 VLafuente"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01103.x"}

{"title": "Heme oxygenase-1 accelerates cutaneous wound healing in mice.", "abstract": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cytoprotective, pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory enzyme, is strongly induced in injured tissues. Our aim was to clarify its role in cutaneous wound healing. In wild type mice, maximal expression of HO-1 in the skin was observed on the 2(nd) and 3(rd) days after wounding. Inhibition of HO-1 by tin protoporphyrin-IX resulted in retardation of wound closure. Healing was also delayed in HO-1 deficient mice, where lack of HO-1 could lead to complete suppression of reepithelialization and to formation of extensive skin lesions, accompanied by impaired neovascularization. Experiments performed in transgenic mice bearing HO-1 under control of keratin 14 promoter showed that increased level of HO-1 in keratinocytes is enough to improve the neovascularization and hasten the closure of wounds. Importantly, induction of HO-1 in wounded skin was relatively weak and delayed in diabetic (db/db) mice, in which also angiogenesis and wound closure were impaired. In such animals local delivery of HO-1 transgene using adenoviral vectors accelerated the wound healing and increased the vascularization. In summary, induction of HO-1 is necessary for efficient wound closure and neovascularization. Impaired wound healing in diabetic mice may be associated with delayed HO-1 upregulation and can be improved by HO-1 gene transfer.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2009-06-06", "authors": ["AnnaGrochot-Przeczek", "RadoslawLach", "JacekMis", "KlaudiaSkrzypek", "MalgorzataGozdecka", "PatrycjaSroczynska", "MilenaDubiel", "AndrzejRutkowski", "MagdalenaKozakowska", "AnnaZagorska", "JacekWalczynski", "HalinaWas", "JerzyKotlinowski", "JustynaDrukala", "KrzysztofKurowski", "ClaudineKieda", "YannHerault", "JozefDulak", "AlicjaJozkowicz"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0005803"}

Its longer preservation is a major advantage of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and should be also a target of adequacy, beyond Kt/V. Anuric patients no longer benefit from such PD advantage, depending only on dialysis schedule to achieve adequate small solute and volume control. This challenge can be successfully dealt with by using automated PD, icodextrine, low-glucose degradation products and individualized PD profiles. There is evidence that PD advances allow nowadays satisfactory patient survival while keeping the benefits of home dialysis and preserving vascular network.

{"title": "Mechanisms of cell death during peritoneal dialysis. A role for osmotic and oxidative stress.", "abstract": "To offer a condensed description of the modes of cell death and the involved mechanisms behind them as detected in the different layers of the peritoneal tissue during experimental and clinical, long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD).\nSeveral types of cell death have been observed in the mesothelial monolayer: apoptosis, anoikis, secondary necrosis, pure necrosis and mitotic catastrophe. Death of mesothelial cells exposed to glucose-enriched solutions derives mainly from a degree of oxidative insult leading to DNA damage, provoked by glucose itself and/or its degradation products. Use of icodextrin is associated with a higher degree of oxidative injury that also leads to genomic damage and consequently to cell death. Peritoneal leukocytes exposed to glucose-enriched PD solutions share the fate of mesothelial cells. Endothelial cells treated in vitro with high glucose concentrations have higher rates of apoptosis induced by a degree of oxidative stress. Endothelial apoptosis plays an important role in remodeling the vascular network, since this development has been observed at the beginning of neo-angiogenesis and at the branching and regression of microvessels of neoformation. Acute osmotic stress results in increased proportions of mesothelial cells dying in apoptosis, anoikis, secondary necrosis as well as in pure necrosis. After long-term exposure, cells apparently adapt to the new hypertonic environment even though the eventual presence of functional changes cannot be ruled out.\nAll cells lining the peritoneal cavity or living near its immediate environment, exposed most of the time to nonphysiological fluids, undergo changes that lead to their death. This problem is behind the poor regenerative capabilities showed by the mesothelial monolayer, the microvascular changes that lead to neoangiogenesis, and, probably, to a defective response to peritoneal infection. Therapeutic modulation of apoptotic cell death could inhibit its progress. Since liberation of oxygen radicals is thereby causally involved in apoptosis, reduced levels of GDPs and/or use of antioxidants appear to be indicated in order to prevent mesothelial, endothelial cells and leukocyte death.", "journal": "Contributions to nephrology", "date": "2009-06-06", "authors": ["LazaroGotloib"], "doi": "10.1159/000223778"}

However, the mechanisms regulating the distribution of auxin in the leaf primordium are largely unknown. Here we show that vacuolar SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), VAM3 and VTI11, are required for the formation of the leaf vascular network in a dosage-dependent manner. This is the first report to show that the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC)-vacuole traffic pathway is required for the formation of the leaf vascular network. vam3-4, a VAM3-defective mutant, was found to have an immature vascular network. An analysis of the DR5 reporter in vam3-4 indicated that VAM3 is involved in the proper pattern formation of auxin maxima in the leaf primordium. This suggests that the immature vascular network in vam3-4 was mainly determined at the stage of procambium formation in the leaf primordium. The abnormal distribution of auxin maxima was caused by the non-polarized localization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1 (PIN-FORMED 1) in leaf primordium cells. VAM3 is the first key protein which is required for the proper localization of PIN1 in leaf cells. Finally, we found that PIN1 proteins were constitutively transported to vacuoles in leaf and roots cells. Our findings demonstrate that the PVC-vacuole pathway is required for the formation of auxin maxima, which regulates the polar localization of PIN1, which, in turn, is required for the formation of the leaf vascular network.", "journal": "Plant & cell physiology", "date": "2009-06-06", "authors": ["MakotoShirakawa", "HarukoUeda", "TomooShimada", "ChiakiNishiyama", "IkukoHara-Nishimura"], "doi": "10.1093/pcp/pcp076"}
{"title": "Maturation of blood vessels by haematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells: involvement of apelin/APJ and angiopoietin/Tie2 interactions in vessel caliber size regulation.", "abstract": "Apelin is a recently-isolated bioactive peptide from bovine gastric extract. The gene encodes a protein of 77 amino acids, which can generate two active polypeptides, long (42-77) and short (65-77). Both peptides ligate and activate APJ, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Although an essential role for the apelin/APJ system in blood vessel formation has been reported in Xenopus, its precise function in mammals is unclear. Blood vessel tube formation is accomplished by two main mechanisms: 1) single cell hollowing, in which a lumen forms within the cytoplasm of a single endothelial cell (EC), and 2) cord hollowing in which a luminal cavity is created de novo between ECs in a thin cylindrical cord. Molecular control of either single cell or cord hollowing has not been precisely determined. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) has been reported to induce enlargement of blood vessels. Apelin is produced from ECs upon activation of Tie2, a cognate receptor of Ang1, expressed on ECs. It has been suggested that apelin induces cord hollowing by promoting proliferation and aggregation/assembly of ECs. During angiogenesis, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) are frequently observed in the perivascular region. They produce Ang1 and induce migration of ECs, resulting in a fine vascular network. Moreover, HSCs/HPCs can induce apelin production from ECs. Therefore, this review article posits that HSCs/HPCs regulate caliber size of blood vessels via apelin/APJ and Angiopoietin/Tie2 interactions.", "journal": "Thrombosis and haemostasis", "date": "2009-06-06", "authors": ["NobuyukiTakakura", "HiroyasuKidoya"], "doi": null}

An attractive therapeutic approach to overcome this is based on co-implantation of endothelial cells to create vascular networks. We have investigated the potential of human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to form functional blood vessels in vivo in direct comparison to vascular-derived endothelial cells, represented by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).\nEPCs were isolated from human peripheral blood, expanded in vitro and analysed in vitro for phenotypical and functional parameters. In vivo vasculogenic potential of EPCs and HUVECs was evaluated in a xenograft model where spheroidal endothelial aggregates were implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice.\nEPCs were indistinguishable from HUVECs in terms of expression of classical endothelial markers CD31, von Willebrand factor, VE-cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor-R2, and in their ability to endocytose acetylated low-density lipoprotein. Moreover, EPCs and HUVECs displayed almost identical angiogenic potential in vitro, as assessed by in vitro Matrigel sprouting assay. However in vivo, a striking and unexpected difference between EPCs and HUVECs was detected. Whereas implanted HUVEC spheroids gave rise to formation of a stable network of perfused microvessels, implanted EPC spheroids showed significantly impaired ability to form vascular structures under identical experimental conditions.\nOur results indicate that vascular-derived endothelial cells, such as HUVECs are superior to EPCs in terms of promoting in vivo vascularization of engineered tissues.", "journal": "Cell proliferation", "date": "2009-06-06", "authors": ["GFinkenzeller", "SGraner", "C JKirkpatrick", "SFuchs", "G BStark"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2184.2009.00610.x"}
{"title": "Development of hepatic tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Liver transplantation is still the only treatment for end-staged liver diseases in children. However, donor organ shortage and immunosuppression are major limitations. Thus, approaches of hepatocyte transplantation are under investigation.

For the development of cell-transplantation techniques, the use of three-dimensional scaffolds as carrier was shown to be advantageous. Polymeric matrices permit the formation of a neo-tissue and stimulation by the modification of the matrix surface. Another important issue is to define the right cell type for transplantation. Adult hepatocytes have a limited growth and differentiation potential. In contrast, fetal liver cells (FLC) possess an enormous growth and a bipotential differentiation potential. Thus, these cells may be very attractive as a cell resource for developing cell-based liver replacement. A third major issue in this approach is the neo-vascularization. Therefore, the transplantation in a recently developed model using a microsurgically created arterioveno-venous (AV) loop as a central vessel for the neo-tissue was used for transplantation of FLC in a fibrin-matrix.

Therefore, strategies that augment neovascularization need to be identified. We propose an in vitro strategy consisting of the simultaneous culture of osteoblasts and endothelial cells on a starch-based scaffold for the formation of pre-vascular structures, with the final aim of accelerating the establishment of a vascular bed in the implanted construct. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) were co-cultured with human osteoblasts (hOBs) on a 3D starch-based scaffold and after 21 days of culture HDMEC aligned and organized into microcapillary-like structures. These vascular-like structures evolved from a cord-like configuration to a more complex branched morphology, had a lumen and stained in the perivascular region for type IV collagen. Genetic profiling of 84 osteogenesis-related genes was performed on co-culture vs. monoculture. Osteoblasts in co-culture showed a significant up-regulation of type I collagen and immunohistochemistry revealed that the scaffold was filled with a dense matrix stained for type I collagen. In direct contact with HDMEC hOBs secreted higher amounts of VEGF in relation to monoculture and the highest peak in the release profile correlated with the formation of microcapillary-like structures. The heterotypic communication between the two cell types was also assured by direct cell-cell contact as shown by the expression of the gap junction connexin 43. In summary, by making use of heterotypic cellular crosstalk this co-culture system is a strategy to form vascular-like structures in vitro on a 3D scaffold.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2009-06-03", "authors": ["Marina ISantos", "Ronald EUnger", "Rui ASousa", "Rui LReis", "C JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.05.004"}

Using neovascularization models based on the chick chorioallantoic membrane and the healing mouse cornea, we found that tissue tension generated by activated fibroblasts or myofibroblasts during wound contraction mediated and directed translocation of the vasculature. These mechanical forces pulled vessels from the preexisting vascular bed as vascular loops with functional circulation that expanded as an integral part of the growing granulation tissue through vessel enlargement and elongation. Blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 confirmed that biomechanical forces were sufficient to mediate the initial vascular growth independently of endothelial sprouting or proliferation.

CAMs belong to different protein families, depending on their structural and functional properties. Furthermore, the expression of certain CAMs under physiological conditions is restricted to specific cell types. Besides playing a key homeostatic role in maintaining the architecture of quiescent tissues, CAMs have also to adapt to the microenvironmental changes that occur during certain physiological and pathological processes. This is best exemplified by cancer vascularization, where the expression and function of vascular CAMs are dynamically regulated in response to tissue alterations induced by tumor growth as well as by changes in the surrounding stroma. This enables endothelial cells (ECs) to leave the quiescent state and re-enter the angiogenic cascade. The latter is a multistep process carried out by different types of specialized ECs.

These processes are also involved in the development of the fetal and placental vasculatures. During vasculogenesis, formation of the earliest primitive capillaries is achieved by in situ differentiation of hemangiogenic stem cells that are derived from pluripotent mesenchymal cells. The subsequent process, angiogenesis, is characterized by development of new vessels from already existing vessels, and is a well coordinated process initiated by stimulation of various growth factors. Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are important and complex processes involving extensive interplay between cells and growth factors. The development, maturation and maintenance of the vascular network are necessary for successful hemochorial placentation as well as normal embryonic development and growth. In this review, we outline the basic mechanisms of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle and different stages of implantation, and consider how this data can be applied to human pregnancy. Recent studies have shown that during the initiation steps of implantation, angiogenic factors trigger vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Different inducers and stimulators affect angiogenesis and vasculogenesis by directly or indirectly stimulating proliferation, differentiation and migration of endothelial or respective precursor cells.

To this end, 15\u00a0cases of active primary pterygium and five cases of recurrent pterygium from Tunisia were studied by immunohistochemistry. Antibodies raised against VEGF and p53 were used to analyze the distribution and expression of these markers in pterygium and normal human conjunctiva were used as negative control. VEGF and p53 proteins were found in all cases of primary pterygium in epithelial, fibroblast and vascular endothelial cells. Active primary and recurrent pterygium have different patterns of expression. In primary pterygium, an important variability of p53 and VEGF expression was observed. However, in recurrent pterygium, p53 immunoreactivity was weak to moderate, whereas VEGF immunoreactivity was strong. In normal human conjunctiva, VEGF and p53 expression was weak to negative. The overexpression of VEGF in active primary and recurrent pterygium suggests that angiogenesis may play a role in pterygium pathogenesis and the expression of p53 in active primary pterygium, which might be associated with its mutated form, supports the hypothesis that actinic radiation may be involved in the genesis of pterygium.

{"title": "Chondromodulin-1 directly suppresses growth of human cancer cells.", "abstract": "Chondromodulin-1 (ChM1), an endogenous anti-angiogenic factor expressed in cartilage, has been suggested to inhibit invasion of endothelial cells into cartilage. In addition, the ectopic administration of ChM1 has been reported to suppress tumorigenesis in vivo. However, it is unclear whether the anti-tumor effect is due to not only the anti-vascularization effect of ChM1, but also its direct action against oncocytes. In the present study, we sought to determine whether ChM1 has a direct action on tumor cells.\nBrdU incorporation assay was performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs), HepG2 cells and HeLa cells in the presence or absence of recombinant human ChM1 (rhChM1). An adenovirus that expresses ChM1, Ad-ChM1, was established and applied to the tumor xenografted in vivo, and to in vitro tumor cells cultured on plates or in soft agar. Cell cycle-related proteins and the phosphorylation of Erk, Akt, and GSK3beta, the downstream molecules of the extracellular matrix-integrin signaling pathways, in HepG2 cells treated with or without Ad-ChM1 were detected by western blot analysis. Luciferase reporter assays of STAT, GAS, and ISRE, which participate in another cytokine signaling pathway, ware performed in HepG2, HeLa, and HUVEC cells.\nChM1 suppressed BrdU incorporation in HUVECs and in HepG2 cells dose-dependently, but did not suppress BrdU incorporation in NHDFs and HeLa cells cultured on plates. In soft agar, however, ChM1 suppressed the growth of HeLa cells, as well as HepG2 cells. Western blot analyses demonstrated that ChM1 decreased the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and cdk6 and increased those of p21cip1 without affecting the phosphorylation levels of Erk, Akt, and GSK3beta in HepG2 cells. The luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that ChM1 suppressed the transcriptional activities of STAT and GAS but not of ISRE.\nChM1 directly suppressed the proliferation of tumor cells in an anchorage-independent manner. However, ChM1 did not alter the phosphorylation of downstream molecules, at which the signaling pathways through growth factor and cytokine receptors converge with the anchorage-dependent pathway. Our results show that ChM1 has a direct anti-tumor effect; moreover, this effect occurs by inhibiting the STAT signaling pathway.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2009-06-02", "authors": ["HisashiMera", "HiroyukiKawashima", "TatsuyaYoshizawa", "OsamuIshibashi", "Md MoksedAli", "TadashiHayami", "HiroshiKitahara", "HiroshiYamagiwa", "NaokiKondo", "AkiraOgose", "NaotoEndo", "HiroyukiKawashima"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-9-166\n10.1097/00000658-197203000-00014\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3801\n10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6762\n10.1016/0006-291X(91)91660-5\n10.1074/jbc.272.51.32419\n10.1006/bbrc.1997.7820\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01201-6\n10.1016/S0014-5793(97)00291-3\n10.1002/art.20193\n10.1083/jcb.139.3.575\n10.1002/jcp.1041330309\n10.1016/0006-291X(89)92208-0\n10.1007/s11626-998-0094-x\n10.1006/bbrc.1999.0171\n10.1038/sj.onc.1202909\n10.1038/ncb0402-e65\n10.1007/s10555-005-5130-7\n10.1002/1521-1878(200102)23:2<161::AID-BIES1023>3.0.CO;2-0\n10.1038/sj.onc.1205260\n10.1038/sj.leu.2403241\n10.2174/156800906776056491\n10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00227.x\n10.1007/BF02899273\n10.1073/pnas.93.3.1320\n10.1080/03008200590935547\n10.1016/S0945-053X(00)00110-4\n10.1128/MCB.23.2.636-644.2003\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199901)21:1<47::AID-BIES6>3.0.CO;2-N\n10.1038/nm1476"}

A concurrent 60% decrease in VEGF protein secretion was mostly apparent upon inhibition of PI-3K. Inhibition of ERK1/2 hardly affected VEGF mRNA or protein secretion. Two unselected human melanoma cell lines with high metastatic potential contained high bFGF and VEGF, while three non- or sporadically metastatic cell lines displayed low bFGF and VEGF.\nThese data indicate that stimulation of VEGF protein secretion in response to bFGF overexpression may contribute to increased vascularization and enhanced aggressiveness in melanoma.", "journal": "Cellular oncology : the official journal of the International Society for Cellular Oncology", "date": "2009-05-30", "authors": ["DennisFontijn", "Linda J WBosch", "Monique C ADuyndam", "Maria P Avan Berkel", "Maarten LJanmaat", "EpieBoven"], "doi": "10.3233/CLO-2009-0477"}

This suggests that local production of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) could play an important role in the differentiation of these cells. To test this hypothesis, we engineered mutant mice that do not express the Cyp27b1 gene in chondrocytes. Inactivation of both alleles of the Cyp27b1 gene led to decreased RANKL expression and reduced osteoclastogenesis, increased width of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate at embryonic d 15.5, increased bone volume in neonatal long bones, and increased expression of the chondrocytic differentiation markers Indian Hedgehog and PTH/PTHrP receptor. The expression of the angiogenic marker VEGF was decreased, accompanied by decreased platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 staining in the neonatal growth plate, suggesting a delay in vascularization. In parallel, we engineered strains of mice overexpressing a Cyp27b1 transgene in chondrocytes by coupling the Cyp27b1 cDNA to the collagen alpha(1)(II) promoter. The transgenic mice showed a mirror image phenotype when compared with the tissue-specific inactivation, i.e. a reduction in the width of the hypertrophic zone of the embryonic growth plate, decreased bone volume in neonatal long bones, and inverse expression patterns of chondrocytic differentiation markers.

{"title": "Extracellular matrix in pancreatic islets: relevance to scaffold design and transplantation.", "abstract": "Intrahepatic islet transplantation provides a potentially more benign alternative to pancreatic transplantation. However, islet transplants are associated with limited engraftment potential. This inefficiency is likely at least partially attributable to the isolation process, which removes islets from their native environment. Isolation not only disrupts the internal vascularization and innervation of islets, but also fundamentally changes interactions between islet cells and macromolecules of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Signaling interactions between islet cells and ECM are known to regulate multiple aspects of islet physiology, including survival, proliferation, and insulin secretion. Although it is highly likely that disruptions to these interactions during isolation significantly affect transplant outcomes, the true implications of these conditions are not well understood. The following article reviews current understandings and uncertainties in islet-ECM interactions and explains their potential impact on posttransplant engraftment. Topics covered include matrix and receptor compositions in native islets, effects of isolation and culture on islet-ECM interactions, and potential for postisolation restoration of islet-ECM interactions. Greater understanding in these areas may help to reduce isolation and transplantation stresses and improve islet engraftment.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2009-05-30", "authors": ["John CStendahl", "Dixon BKaufman", "Samuel IStupp"], "doi": "10.3727/096368909788237195"}

During murine embryogenesis, nearly all BMs of mesenchymal origin express perlecan, and it is believed to participate in the supramolecular assembly of BMs. However, the distribution of perlecan in human embryonic and fetal tissues is widely unknown, except for cartilage anlagen of developing extremities and the fetal spine. Clinical syndromes, caused by perlecan-associated mutations or gene-defects, suggest its multifunctional involvement during human development. Here we reveal the immunohistochemistry of perlecan domains III and V during human development from gestational weeks (gw) 6 to 12 in basement membrane zones (BMZs) of the developing brain, nervous system, blood vessels, skin, lung, heart, kidney, liver, intestine and skeletal system. Interestingly, a difference in the distribution of the two perlecan domains was found in the endoneurium of ganglia. Domain III is strongly present from gw 6 onwards, while domain V shows attenuated expression at this stage and has been detected abundantly only from gw 8 onwards, possibly indicating vascularization of the endoneurium during this early stage.

The neoplastic endothelial cells of canine hemangiosarcomas, hemangiomas, and lymphangiomas showed a strong membrane immunoreactivity for claudin-5, but the other investigated canine malignant and benign tumours, including fibrosarcomas, myxo-, leiomyo-, cardiac rhabdomyo-, neurofibro-, synovial-, osteo-, and chondrosarcomas, spindle cell melanomas, hemangio-pericytomas, benign fibroblast proliferations, and leiomyomas were negative for this endothelial marker. In these non-vascular canine tumours intense immunostaining was detected in the endothelial cells of the incorporated intratumoural vessels and neovasculature. The canine splenic hematomas induced by hemangiosarcomas were distinguished from splenic hematomas induced by non-neoplastic lesions by the means of claudin-5 protein. In hemangiosarcomas the percentage of positive neoplastic endothelial cells was higher, and stronger when using the claudin-5 molecule compared to CD31 and vWf.\nThe results show that claudin-5 molecule can be used as a new differential marker, and could also be of a diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of canine hemangiosarcomas from sarcomas of other origin with hemorrhages or increased vascularization. Claudin-5 could help to reveal neoplastic proliferation of endothelial cells causing splenic hematomas and differentiate these tumours from non-vascular neoplastic splenic lesion.

{"title": "Overexpression of malignancy-associated laminins and laminin receptors by angiotropic human melanoma cells in a chick chorioallantoic membrane model.", "abstract": "As distinct from intravascular/lymphatic dissemination, extravascular migratory metastasis (EVMM) has been described as a potential additional mechanism of melanoma spread in which tumor cells migrate along the external surfaces of vessels. Angiotropic melanoma cells are linked to the endothelium by a matrix containing laminin. In addition, it has been shown that C16 laminin-derived peptide increases extravascular migration of human green fluorescent protein (GFP) melanoma cells along vessels in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model (CAM). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that expression levels of some genes related to lamimin and metastasis are differentially expressed in vascularized angiotropic melanoma areas vs. avascular melanoma areas from the same tumor.\nC8161 human melanoma cells in a shell-less chick CAM assay were used to study EVMM associated with the presence of vascularized angiotropic melanoma areas. For both high-quality histomorphology and RNA preservation in paraffin-embedded tissue, we used a methanol-based fixative coupled with microwave-assisted rapid tissue processing as previously described. Using laser capture microdissection, angiotropic melanoma areas as well as avascular areas were microdissected. Using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), six genes have been studied: LAMC2 (laminin gamma2 chain), LAMA4 (laminin alpha4 chain), ITGB1 (integrin beta1), ITGB3 (integrin beta3), RSPA (ribosomal protein), and MMP2 (matrix metallopeptidase 2). QRT-PCR data were normalized to human GAPDH housekeeping gene and values were compared against Human Total RNA. Final results were expressed as percentage of expression.\nAll tumors demonstrated a similar pattern, i.e. EVMM of angiotropic melanoma cells. The microdissected histopathological sections presented both angiotropic areas and avascular areas.

Since extravascular migration of melanoma cells along vessels has been demonstrated in the CAM model, taken together these results suggests that some laminins and laminin receptors may play a role in extravascular migratory metastasis.

Being fundamental to elucidate organogenesis, it is unlikely that embryonic stem cells will be used for clinical purposes. Postembryonic stage, developing cells are, therefore, the front-runner for regenerative medicine. In addition to autologous cells, both allogeneic and xenogeneic cells are hypothetical candidates to treat specific diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge on immunological and functional aspects of xeno(allo)-cellular transplantation for cardiomyopathy, diabetes, liver failure, neural diseases, and bone regeneration.\nXenocellular transplantation is promising for tissue repair in immunologically privileged sites such as the central nervous system or nonvascularized tissues in which no or moderate immunosuppression is required. In vascularized organs, major immune responses are present when cells are transplanted without additional conditioning. Positive results from encapsulation methods that protect cells from the immune system should further stimulate preclinical research. Also, conditioning immunosuppression could be used to circumvent the initial immune response. Transgenic pigs cells are probably the best xenogeneic substitute for human application, although basic research on innate and noninnate immunity toward pig cells is still required.\nIn several fields of medicine, cellular xenotransplantation is slowly emerging as a potential therapeutic tool.", "journal": "Current opinion in organ transplantation", "date": "2009-05-27", "authors": ["Alain JPoncelet", "DufraneDenis", "PierreGianello"], "doi": "10.1097/mot.0b013e3283292522"}
{"title": "Failed vascularized proximal fibular epiphyseal transfer for hip reconstruction following infection in children.", "abstract": "Treatment of the sequellae of hip infection with epiphyseal destruction in children has had limited success to date. The aim of this study was to report mid-term results after hip epiphyseal reconstruction using a proximal vascularized fibular graft in three children presenting with massive epiphyseal destruction of the proximal femur following infection.\nThree children suffered from hip articular destruction type IVB according to the Choi classification after neonatal septic arthritis. The mean age at reconstruction was 4.3 years (range 3-6 years). The Hunka et al. criteria were used to evaluate the functional results, and the clinical evaluation was based on the Musculo-Skeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Growth and fusion of the graft and hip morphology were evaluated on simple X-rays and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A ratio between cephalic diameter and inter-acetabular gap was defined on the MRI scan as the \"acetabular filling index\".\nNo intraoperative complication was reported. With a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (3-6 years), the MSTS score was 22.7/30 (range 20-26), while the average lower limb length discrepancy was 3 cm. Patient 1 required a secondary derotation osteotomy of the femur because of abnormal external rotation and a bad result due to the unexplained occurrence of a painful and stiff hip joint. A secondary distal transfer of the greater trochanter was performed in patient 2, and good results based on Hunka et al.'s criteria were achieved. The X-rays of patients 1 and 2 showed signs of bone growth and a major remodeling process; the MRI filling indices were 83 and 67%, respectively. Patient 3 developed an early slipped capital (fibular) epiphysis 1 month postoperatively, which was treated by percutaneous pinning; this early complication led to a bad result with full resorption of the graft.\nIn contrast to its success in upper limb reconstruction, in this series of three patients with hip articular destruction, articular reconstruction using a vascularized proximal fibula graft was disappointing and led to unsatisfactory results in terms of hip reconstruction. Such a procedure is complex and highly demanding, necessitating extremely intensive post-operative care. An early slipped capital epiphysis can lead to full graft resorption. Consequently, despite important adaptation and remodeling of the graft, the authors do not recommend this procedure at this location.", "journal": "Journal of children's orthopaedics", "date": "2009-05-27", "authors": ["RomainDebarge", "FranckChotel", "AramGazarian", "J\u00e9r\u00e9myViola", "J\u00e9r\u00f4meBerard"], "doi": "10.1007/s11832-009-0181-x\n10.1097/01241398-198805000-00013\n10.1097/01241398-198309000-00008\n10.1097/bpo.0b013e31815a606f\n10.1016/j.ocl.2006.10.003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12192-7\n10.1097/BPO.0b013e31817bb079\n10.1097/01241398-199005000-00014\n10.1097/01.blo.0000063782.32430.37\n10.2106/JBJS.C.00713\n10.1097/bpo.0b013e31802b711c"}

{"title": "Propranolol adrenergic blockade inhibits human brain endothelial cells tubulogenesis and matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion.", "abstract": "In recent clinical observation, the growth of endothelial tumors, such as hemangiomas of infancy, was repressed by the non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol possibly through targeting of the vascular endothelial compartment. As human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) play an essential role as structural and functional components in tumor angiogenesis, we assessed whether propranolol could target HBMEC's in vitro angiogenic properties. We found that biopsies from human glioblastoma as well as from experimental brain tumor-associated vasculature expressed high levels of the beta2-adrenergic receptor, suggesting adrenergic adaptative processes could take place during tumor vascularization. We observed that in vitro tubulogenesis was significantly reduced by propranolol when HBMEC were seeded on Matrigel. Propranolol, as much as 100microM, did not reduce cell viability and did not alter HBMEC migration as assessed with Boyden chambers. Secretion of the key angiogenic and extracellular matrix degrading enzymes MMP-2 and MMP-9 was assessed by zymography. Propranolol significantly reduced MMP-9 secretion upon treatment with the tumor-promoting agent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, while secretion of MMP-2 remained unaffected. This was correlated with a decrease in MMP-9 gene expression which is, in part, explained by a decrease in the nucleocytoplasmic export of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR. Our data are therefore indicative of a selective role for propranolol in inhibiting MMP-9 secretion and HBMEC tubulogenesis which could potentially add to propranolol's anti-angiogenic properties.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2009-05-27", "authors": ["BorhaneAnnabi", "Marie-PauleLachambre", "KarinePlouffe", "RobertMoumdjian", "RichardB\u00e9liveau"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2009.05.005"}

{"title": "Cyclic deformation-induced solute transport in tissue scaffolds with computer designed, interconnected, pore networks: experiments and simulations.", "abstract": "Nutrient supply and waste removal in porous tissue engineering scaffolds decrease from the periphery to the center, leading to limited depth of ingrowth of new tissue into the scaffold. However, as many tissues experience cyclic physiological strains, this may provide a mechanism to enhance solute transport in vivo before vascularization of the scaffold. The hypothesis of this study was that pore cross-sectional geometry and interconnectivity are of major importance for the effectiveness of cyclic deformation-induced solute transport. Transparent elastic polyurethane scaffolds, with computer-programmed design of pore networks in the form of interconnected channels, were fabricated using a 3D printing and injection molding technique. The scaffold pores were loaded with a colored tracer for optical contrast, cyclically compressed with deformations of 10 and 15% of the original undeformed height at 1.0 Hz. Digital imaging was used to quantify the spatial distribution of the tracer concentration within the pores. Numerical simulations of a fluid-structure interaction model of deformation-induced solute transport were compared to the experimental data. The results of experiments and modeling agreed well and showed that pore interconnectivity heavily influences deformation-induced solute transport. Pore cross-sectional geometry appears to be of less relative importance in interconnected pore networks. Validated computer models of solute transport can be used to design optimal scaffold pore geometries that will enhance the convective transport of nutrients inside the scaffold and the removal of waste, thus improving the cell survivability deep inside the scaffold.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2009-05-26", "authors": ["Jorn OpDen Buijs", "DanDragomir-Daescu", "Erik LRitman"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-009-9712-3"}

Thus, our aim was to evaluate the action of long-term treatment with olmesartan on cardiac and aortic adverse remodeling and its relationship with blood pressure (BP) and tensile forces acting on the aortic wall. Five-month-old male rats were divided in: WKY group (n = 6), SHR group (n = 6), and SHRs treated with hydralazine 30 mg/kg/day (SHR-H, n = 8) or olmesartan 10 mg/kg/day (SHR-O, n = 8). Medications were administered for 16 weeks. The SHR group showed hypertension (189 +/- 4 mmHg), cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (+107%), interstitial fibrosis (5.7% vs 1.9% in WKY), and reduced intramyocardial vascularization (9.1% vs 22.8% in WKY). In aorta, the SHRs showed outward hypertrophic remodeling, increased elastic fibers content (+36%), and increased circumferential wall tension (CWT, 2.79 x 10(4) dyne/cm) and tensile stress (TS, 261.4 x 10(4) dyne/cm(2)). Hydralazine and olmesartan decreased BP (-45% approximately) and likewise CWT and TS (-45% and -35% approximately). Both medications prevented left ventricle remodeling, but olmesartan improved cardiomyocyte hypertrophy better than hydralazine. Hydralazine did not alter media hypertrophy, but it enlarged lumen diameter and increased elastic fibers. It is unlikely that olmesartan prevented all aortic alterations. Taken together, long-term control of BP alone is not sufficient to prevent aortic remodeling due to hypertension, but in myocardium it seems to be enough, except for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The differential action of olmesartan suggests that it is essential to block growth stimulation by angiotensin II in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in order to better prevent cardiovascular adverse remodeling due to arterial hypertension.", "journal": "Heart and vessels", "date": "2009-05-26", "authors": ["CarolineFernandes-Santos", "Leonardode Souza Mendon\u00e7a", "Carlos AlbertoMandarim-de-Lacerda"], "doi": "10.1007/s00380-008-1104-3"}
{"title": "A 3-D model of tumor progression based on complex automata driven by particle dynamics.", "abstract": "The dynamics of a growing tumor involving mechanical remodeling of healthy tissue and vasculature is neglected in most of the existing tumor models. This is due to the lack of efficient computational framework allowing for simulation of mechanical interactions. Meanwhile, just these interactions trigger critical changes in tumor growth dynamics and are responsible for its volumetric and directional progression. We describe here a novel 3-D model of tumor growth, which combines particle dynamics with cellular automata concept. The particles represent both tissue cells and fragments of the vascular network. They interact with their closest neighbors via semi-harmonic central forces simulating mechanical resistance of the cell walls. The particle dynamics is governed by both the Newtonian laws of motion and the cellular automata rules. These rules can represent cell life-cycle and other biological interactions involving smaller spatio-temporal scales. We show that our complex automata, particle based model can reproduce realistic 3-D dynamics of the entire system consisting of the tumor, normal tissue cells, blood vessels and blood flow. It can explain phenomena such as the inward cell motion in avascular tumor, stabilization of tumor growth by the external pressure, tumor vascularization due to the process of angiogenesis, trapping of healthy cells by invading tumor, and influence of external (boundary) conditions on the direction of tumor progression. We conclude that the particle model can serve as a general framework for designing advanced multiscale models of tumor dynamics and it is very competitive to the modeling approaches presented before.", "journal": "Journal of molecular modeling", "date": "2009-05-26", "authors": ["Rafa\u0142Wcis\u0142o", "WitoldDzwinel", "David AYuen", "Arkadiusz ZDudek"], "doi": "10.1007/s00894-009-0511-4"}

Unexpectedly, perichondrial tissue remained avascular in addition to cartilage. Hypervascularization of tissues similarly occurred when various VEGF-A isoforms were overexpressed in the chick forelimb, but also in this case perichondrial tissue and cartilage were completely devoid of vasculature. However, following bony collar formation, anti-angiogenic properties in perichondrial tissue were lost and perichondrial angiogenesis was accelerated by VEGF-A(146), VEGF-A(166), or VEGF-A(190). Once the perichondrium was vascularized, osteoclast precursors were recruited from the circulation and the induction of MMP9 and MMP13 can be observed in parallel with the activation of TGF-beta signaling. Neither perichondrial angiogenesis nor the subsequent cartilage vascularization was found to be accelerated by the non-heparin-binding VEGF-A(122) or by the VEGF-A(166)DeltaE(162)-R(166) mutant lacking a neuropilin-binding motif.

The study consisted of 30 sinuses from 15 human cadavers with an age range of 59 to 90 years. To define the complex vascularization of the maxillary sinus, the afferent vascular network was injected with liquid latex mixed with red india ink through the external carotid arteries. An intraosseous anastomosis between the dental branch of the posterior superior alveolar artery, also known as alveolar antral artery, and the infraorbital artery was found in 100% of cases. Such an anastomosis seemed to guarantee the blood supply to the sinus membrane, to the periosteal tissues, and especially to the anterior lateral wall of the sinus. Moreover, the gingival branch of the posterior superior alveolar artery was found to anastomose an extraosseous branch of the infraorbital artery in 10 sinuses.

In birds, normal lung function requires extensive, dorsally situated nonvascularized abdominal air-sacs ventilated by an expansive sternum and specially hinged costal ribs. The thin walled and voluminous abdominal air-sacs are supported laterally and caudally to prevent inward (paradoxical) collapse during generation of negative (inhalatory) pressure: the synsacrum, posteriorly directed, laterally open pubes and specialized femoral-thigh complex provide requisite support and largely prevent inhalatory collapse. In comparison, theropod dinosaurs probably lacked similarly enlarged abdominal air-sacs, and skeleto-muscular modifications consistent with their ventilation. In the absence of enlarged, functional abdominal air-sacs, theropods were unlikely to have possessed a specialized bird-like, air-sac lung. The likely absence of bird-like pulmonary function in theropods is inconsistent with suggestions of cardiovascular anatomy more sophisticated than that of modern crocodilians.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2009-05-22", "authors": ["Devon EQuick", "John ARuben"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10752"}

We have previously demonstrated high expression of SR by chondrocytes in cartilage. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the possible functional role of D-Ser in chondrogenesis. Expression of mRNA and corresponding protein was seen for SR in cultured rat costal chondrocytes, while the addition of L-Ser significantly increased intracellular and extracellular levels of D-Ser. In organotypic cultured mouse embryonic metatarsals isolated before vascularization, SR mRNA was highly localized in hypertrophic and calcified chondrocytes. Exposure to D-Ser not only suppressed several chondrocytic maturation markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Ca2+ accumulation, nodule formation, and osteopontin expression, in rat chondrocytes, but also delayed chondral mineralization in mouse metatarsals. Either NMDA or Gly alone significantly increased Ca2+ accumulation in cultured chondrocytes, whereas D-Ser significantly prevented Ca2+ accumulation by Gly, but not by NMDA. Gly alone also significantly increased gene transactivation by the introduction of runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2) in COS7 cells transfected with NR1 and NR3A subunits, while D-Ser significantly prevented the increase by Gly without affecting the promoter activity of Runx2. In both cultured chondrocytes and metatarsals from NR1-null mice, significant decreases were seen in ALP activity and chondral mineralization, respectively.

To explore the association of APN with breast cancer and tumor angiogenesis, we took an in vivo approach aiming to study its role in the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) mammary tumor model.\nWe compared the rates of tumor growth in MMTV-PyMT mice in wild-type and APN-null backgrounds.\nHistology and micro-positron emission tomography imaging show that the rate of tumor growth is significantly reduced in the absence of APN at early stages. PyMT/APN knockout mice exhibit a reduction in their angiogenic profile resulting in nutrient deprivation of the tumors and tumor-associated cell death. Surprisingly, in more advanced malignant stages of the disease, tumor growth develops more aggressively in mice lacking APN, giving rise to a larger tumor burden, an increase in the mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, and a gene expression fingerprint indicative of more aggressive tumor cells.\nThese observations highlight a novel important contribution of APN in mammary tumor development and angiogenesis, indicating that APN has potent angio-mimetic properties in tumor vascularization. However, in tumors deprived of APN, this antiangiogenic stress results in an adaptive response that fuels tumor growth through mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and the development of mechanisms enabling massive cell proliferation despite a chronically hypoxic microenvironment.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2009-05-19", "authors": ["ShiraLandskroner-Eiger", "BinzhiQian", "Eric SMuise", "Andrea RNawrocki", "Joel PBerger", "Eugene JFine", "WadeKoba", "YingfengDeng", "Jeffrey WPollard", "Philipp EScherer"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2649"}

The current study experimentally probes the physiologic functions of APN in mammary cancer in a newly generated genetic mouse model.\nWe established an APN null mouse model of mammary cancer by introducing the polyoma virus middle T (PyV-mT) oncogene expressed from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) regulatory elements into APN null mice. MMTV-PyV-mT-induced tumors resemble ErbB2-amplified human breast cancers. We monitored tumor onset, kinetics, and animal survival, and analyzed vascular coverage, apoptosis, and hypoxia in sections from the primary tumors. Metastatic spreading was evaluated by analyses of the lungs.\nAPN prominently localized to the vasculature in human and mouse mammary tumors. In APN null mice, MMTV-PyV-mT-induced tumors appeared with delayed onset and exhibited reduced growth rates. Affected animals survived control tumor-bearing mice by an average of 21 days. Pathologic analyses revealed reduced vascularization of APN null tumors along with increased hypoxia and apoptosis. At the experimental end point, APN null transgenic mice showed increased frequency of pulmonary metastases.\nThe current work identifies a proangiogenic contribution of APN in mammary cancer that, in turn, affects tumor progression.

{"title": "A framework for geometric analysis of vascular structures: application to cerebral aneurysms.", "abstract": "There is well-documented evidence that vascular geometry has a major impact in blood flow dynamics and consequently in the development of vascular diseases, like atherosclerosis and cerebral aneurysmal disease. The study of vascular geometry and the identification of geometric features associated with a specific pathological condition can therefore shed light into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Although the development of medical imaging technologies is providing increasing amounts of data on the three-dimensional morphology of the in vivo vasculature, robust and objective tools for quantitative analysis of vascular geometry are still lacking. In this paper, we present a framework for the geometric analysis of vascular structures, in particular for the quantification of the geometric relationships between the elements of a vascular network based on the definition of centerlines. The framework is founded upon solid computational geometry criteria, which confer robustness of the analysis with respect to the high variability of in vivo vascular geometry. The techniques presented are readily available as part of the VMTK, an open source framework for image segmentation, geometric characterization, mesh generation and computational hemodynamics specifically developed for the analysis of vascular structures.

In addition, we describe a new technique of measuring the position of a scaphoid fracture and provide data on its reproducibility.\nThirty-one patients operated on by the senior author for delayed union or nonunion of scaphoid fracture were included. Preoperative CT scans were independently assessed for increased radiodensity of the proximal pole, converging trabeculae, degree of deformity, comminution, and fracture position. Intraoperative biopsies of the proximal pole were obtained and histologically assessed for evidence of avascular necrosis. The radiologic variables were statistically compared with the histologic findings. The presence of avascular necrosis was also compared with postoperative union status, identified on longitudinal CT scans.\nPreoperative CT features that statistically correlated with histologic evidence of avascular necrosis were increased radiodensity of the proximal pole and the absence of any converging trabeculae between the fracture fragments. The radiologic changes of avascular necrosis and the histologic confirmation of avascular necrosis were associated with persistent nonunion.\nPreoperative longitudinal CT of scaphoid nonunion is of great value in identifying avascular necrosis and predicting subsequent fracture union.

{"title": "Interference by adrenaline with chondrogenic differentiation through suppression of gene transactivation mediated by Sox9 family members.", "abstract": "In contrast to osteoblasts, little attention has been paid to the functional expression of adrenergic signaling machineries in chondrocytes. Expression of mRNA was for the first time demonstrated for different adrenergic receptor (AdR) subtypes in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells and mouse metatarsals isolated before vascularization in culture, but not for other molecules related to adrenergic signaling. In neonatal mouse tibial sections, beta(2)AdR and alpha(2a)AdR mRNA expression was found in chondrocytes at different developmental stages by in situ hybridization. Exposure to adrenaline significantly suppressed expression of several maturation markers through the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway activated by beta(2)AdR without affecting cellular proliferation in both cultured ATDC5 cells and metatarsals. Adrenaline also significantly inhibited gene transactivation by sry-type HMG box 9 (Sox9) family members essential for chondrogenic differentiation in a manner prevented by the general betaAdR antagonist propranolol, with a concomitant significant decrease in the levels of Sox6 mRNA and corresponding protein, in ATDC5 cells and primary cultured mouse costal chondrocytes. Systemic administration of propranolol significantly promoted the increased expression of mRNA for collagen I and collagen X, but not for collagen II, in callus of fractured femur in mice.

{"title": "Wnt2 acts as an angiogenic growth factor for non-sinusoidal endothelial cells and inhibits expression of stanniocalcin-1.", "abstract": "Recently, we have shown that Wnt2 is an autocrine growth and differentiation factor for hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells. As Wnt signaling has become increasingly important in vascular development and cancer, we analyzed Wnt signaling in non-sinusoidal endothelial cells of different vascular origin (HUVEC, HUAEC, HMVEC-LLy). Upon screening the multiple components of the Wnt pathway, we demonstrated lack of Wnt2 expression, but presence of Frizzled-4, one of its receptors, in cultured non-sinusoidal endothelial cells. Treatment of these cells by exogenous Wnt2 induced endothelial proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis in vitro. Upon analysis of Wnt2 tissue expression as a basis for paracrine Wnt2 effects on non-sinusoidal endothelial cells in vivo, Wnt2 was found to be expressed in densely vascularized murine malignant tumors and in wound healing tissues in close proximity to CD31+ endothelial cells. By gene profiling, stanniocalcin-1 (STC1), a known regulator of angiogenesis, was identified as a target gene of Wnt2 signaling in HUVEC down-regulated by Wnt2 treatment. Tumor-conditioned media counter-acted Wnt2 and up-regulated STC1 expression in HUVEC.

We have previously shown that human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) form functioning vessels in mice, but these are limited in number and persistence; and also that human adipose stromal cells (ASCs) are multipotent cells with pericytic properties which can stabilize vascular assembly in vitro. In this study, we tested whether ASCs would cooperate with EPCs to coassemble vessels in in vivo implants. Collagen implants containing EPCs, ASCs, or a 4:1 mixture of both were placed subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice. After a range of time periods, constructs were explanted and evaluated with regard to vascular network assembly and cell fate; and heterotypic cell interactions were explored by targeted molecular perturbations. The density and complexity of vascular networks formed by the synergistic dual-cell system was many-fold higher than found in implants containing either ASCs or EPCs alone. Coimplantation of ASCs and EPCs with either pancreatic islets or adipocytes produced neoorgans populated by these parenchymal cells, as well as by chimeric human vessels conducting flow. This study is the first to demonstrate prompt and consistent assembly of a vascular network by human ASCs and endothelial cells and vascularization by these cells of parenchymal cells in implants.

Here, we describe the properties of inducible vectors based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV), allowing precise control of VEGF expression, and exploit these vectors to define the kinetics of the angiogenic response elicited by the factor.\nBased on a tetracycline-inducible transactivator, we designed an AAV vector system allowing the pharmacological regulation of VEGF production in vivo and tested its efficacy in inducing functional neoangiogenesis in both normoperfused and ischaemic skeletal muscle in mice by a combination of histological, immunofluorescent, and molecular imaging techniques. We observed that a prolonged expression of VEGF was required to determine the formation of stable vessels, able to persist upon withdrawal of the angiogenic stimulus. However, the vessels formed in the presence of continuous VEGF expression consisted mainly of dilated and leaky capillaries. As determined after pinhole scintigraphy, this abnormal vasculature accounted for a significant drop in functional tissue perfusion. In contrast, transient VEGF expression, followed by a period of VEGF withdrawal, allowed maintenance of functional perfusion under resting conditions and during exercise. This VEGF-inducible system was highly effective in improving vascularization and function in a hind-limb ischaemia model.\nTogether, these results clearly indicate that the fine tuning of VEGF expression is required to achieve the formation of a stable vasculature able to sustain functional neovascularization.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2009-05-16", "authors": ["SabrinaTafuro", "EduardAyuso", "SerenaZacchigna", "LorenaZentilin", "SilviaMoimas", "FrancaDore", "MauroGiacca"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvp152"}

Both recombinant human growth factor proteins and their gene therapy are in human clinical trials to heal chronic wounds. As platelet-derived growth factor-bb (PDGF-BB) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) are known to induce chemotaxis, proliferation, differentiation, and matrix synthesis, we investigated a non-viral means for gene delivery of these factors using the cationic polysaccharide chitosan. Chitosan is a polymer of glucosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine, in which the percentage of the residues that are glucosamine is called the degree of deacetylation (DDA). The purpose of this study was to express PDGF-BB and FGF-2 genes in mice using chitosan-plasmid DNA nanoparticles for the controlled delivery of genetic material in a specific, efficient, and safe manner. PDGF-BB and FGF-2 genes were amplified from human tissues by RT-PCR. To increase the secretion of FGF-2, a recombinant 4sFGF-2 was constructed bearing eight amino-acid residues of the signal peptide of FGF-4. PCR products were inserted into the expression vector pVax1 to produce recombinant plasmids pVax1-4sFGF2 and pVax1-PDGF-BB, which were then injected into BALB/C mice in the format of polyelectrolyte nanocomplexes with specific chitosans of controlled DDA and molecular weight, including 92-10, 80-10, and 80-80 (DDA-number average molecular weight or M(n) in kDa). ELISA assays on mice sera showed that recombinant FGF-2 and PDGF-BB proteins were efficiently expressed and specific antibodies to these proteins could be identified in sera of injected mice, but with levels that were clearly dependent on the specific chitosan used. We found high DDA low molecular weight chitosans to be efficient protein expressors with minimal or no generation of neutralizing antibodies, while lowering DDA resulted in greater antibody levels and correspondingly lower levels of detected recombinant protein. Histological analyses corroborated these results by revealing greater inflammatory infiltrates in lower DDA chitosans, which produced higher antibody titers.

The emphasis is on understanding the role of lymphatics in the cornea as related to angiogenesis and the clinical setting of corneal transplant rejection. The lymphatic system has two main functions: to drain excess extracellular fluid from capillary beds to return to the systemic blood circulation and to capture antigen for presentation to the immune system in the lymphoid compartment (e.g. nodes) connected in parallel to the lymphatic system. The normal cornea is devoid of lymphatic vessels and blood vessels, thus allowing for its unique immune privileged status. Abnormal blood vessel growth into the cornea has been studied for many years, but the study of lymphatic vessels has been hampered until the recent discovery of lymphatic-specific markers. Subsequent studies of vascularized corneas support the presence of lymphatic vessels in the cornea. The growth of new lymphatic (lymphangiogenesis) and blood (hemangiogenesis) vessels in the cornea is closely related to the abrogation of the immune privileged status of the cornea.

{"title": "Protons make tumor cells move like clockwork.", "abstract": "Cancer accounts for 13% of the yearly total mortality worldwide. Most cancer deaths are the sequel of metastatic diseases rather than of primary tumor growth. Thus, the major challenge in tumor therapy is the tumor cells' ability to metastasize. The extent to which a tumor metastasizes correlates with the tumor cells' migratory activity. Tumor cell migration requires a coordinated formation and release of cell adhesion contacts, a controlled cytoskeletal dynamics, the digestion and reorganization of the extracellular matrix, and local ion and water transport across the plasma membrane. All of these operations depend on intracellular pH (pH(i)) and extracellular pH (pH(e)). Numerous H(+), HCO (3) (-) , and monocarboxylate transporters as well as different carbonic anhydrase isozymes have considerable impact on pH(i) and pH(e) which spotlights them as possible, potential targets for anticancer therapeutics. Especially in solid tumors whose vascularization is often not sufficient, tumor cells cope with hypoxia and the resulting glycolysis by overexpressing the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE1, monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and/or MCT4, and the carbonic anhydrase CA IX. NHE1, MCT, and CA IX activity lead to an acidification of the extracellular space in order to maintain the cytosolic pH homeostasis stable. The present article gives a review on how this characteristic, acidic tumor micro- and nanoenvironment controls tumor cell migration.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2009-05-14", "authors": ["ChristianStock", "AlbrechtSchwab"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-009-0677-8"}

We have employed mice, which develop an adult onset of obesity due to the lack the neuronal specific transcription factor Nscl-2 to investigate the interplay between the nervous system and white adipose tissue (WAT).\nChanges in the architecture and innervation of WAT were compared between wildtype, Nscl2-/-, ob/ob and Nscl2-/-//ob/ob mice using morphological methods, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Metabolic alterations in mutant mice and in isolated cells were investigated under basal and stimulated conditions.\nWe found that Nscl-2 mutant mice show a massive reduction of innervation of white epididymal and paired subcutaneous inguinal fat tissue including sensory and autonomic nerves as demonstrated by peripherin and neurofilament staining. Reduction of innervation went along with defects in the formation of the microvasculature, accumulation of cells of the macrophage/preadipocyte lineage, a bimodal distribution of the size of fat cells, and metabolic defects of isolated adipocytes. Despite a relative insulin resistance of white adipose tissue and isolated Nscl-2 mutant adipocytes the serum level of insulin in Nscl-2 mutant mice was only slightly increased.\nWe conclude that the reduction of the innervation and vascularization of WAT in Nscl-2 mutant mice leads to the increase of preadipocyte/macrophage-like cells, a bimodal distribution of the size of adipocytes in WAT and an altered metabolic activity of adipocytes.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2009-05-14", "authors": ["KarenRuschke", "HenningEbelt", "NoraKl\u00f6ting", "ThomasBoettger", "KayRaum", "MatthiasBl\u00fcher", "ThomasBraun"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0005516"}

Host Vav2/3 deficiency reduced microvascular density, as well as tumor growth and/or survival, in transplanted B16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma models in vivo. These defects were due in part to Vav2/3 deficiency in endothelial cells. Vav2/3-deficient endothelial cells displayed reduced migration in response to tumor cells in coculture migration assays, and failed to incorporate into tumor vessels and enhance tumor volume in tumor-endothelial cotransplantation experiments.

We studied the skin incubation of Pipa carvalhoi using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The skin consists of a stratified epithelium with a one-layered stratum corneum, and the dermis. The dermis of the dorsal skin of nonreproductive and reproductive females lacks a distinct stratum compactum, which is typical for most anuran skins. The entire dermis shows irregularly arranged collagen bundles like a stratum spongiosum. Before egg laying, the skin swells, primarily by thickening and further by loosening of the middle zone of the dermis. In the epidermis, large furrows develop that are the prospective sites of egg nidation. The epidermis, which forms a brood chamber around the developing egg becomes bi-layered and very thin and lacks a stratum corneum. Further, the dermis loosens and becomes heavily vascularized. Egg carrying females do not have mature oocytes in their ovaries indicating a slow down or interruption of egg maturation during this period.

Murine models that recapitulate aspects of PJS have been created. Here we examine the therapeutic effect of rapamycin, a macrolide with anti-tumourigenic and anti-angiogenic properties, in reducing tumour incidence in a large cohort of Lkb1(+/-) mice. To study the influence of early intervention, the animals were dosed with rapamycin from the age of 8 weeks, well before the onset of polyposis. These mice continued to receive the drug, which was well tolerated, throughout their lives. At sacrifice, we observed a reduction in gastric tumour burden in the rapamycin-treated mice (p = 0.0001) compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Treated animals also have a lower number of polyps per mouse than controls. In the polyps from the treated mice, phosphorylation of ribosomal p70 S6 kinase was maintained, while the phosphorylation of AKT at serine-473 was elevated, suggesting that mTORC1 function is maintained at this dosage. Despite this, a significant reduction in microvessel density was seen in polyps from the rapamycin-treated mice compared to those from the control mice (p = 5 x 10(-5)), suggesting that the anti-angiogenic effect of rapamycin played a role in polyp reduction. Overall, we demonstrated that prolonged oral administration of rapamycin from an early age is effective in lowering tumour burden in the Lkb1(+/-) mice without evident side effects.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2009-05-13", "authors": ["JamesRobinson", "CeciliaLai", "AlisonMartin", "EmmaNye", "IanTomlinson", "AndrewSilver"], "doi": "10.1002/path.2562"}
{"title": "Embryonic pig pancreatic tissue for the treatment of diabetes in a nonhuman primate model.", "abstract": "Xenotransplantation of pig tissues has great potential to overcome the shortage of organ donors. One approach to address the vigorous immune rejection associated with xenotransplants is the use of embryonic precursor tissue, which induces and utilizes host vasculature upon its growth and development. Recently, we showed in mice that embryonic pig pancreatic tissue from embryonic day 42 (E42) exhibits optimal properties as a beta cell replacement therapy. We now demonstrate the proof of concept in 2 diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys, followed for 393 and 280 days, respectively. A marked reduction of exogenous insulin requirement was noted by the fourth month after transplantation, reaching complete independence from exogenous insulin during the fifth month after transplantation, with full physiological control of blood glucose levels. The porcine origin of insulin was documented by a radioimmunoassay specific for porcine C-peptide. Furthermore, the growing tissue was found to be predominantly vascularized with host blood vessels, thereby evading hyperacute or acute rejection, which could potentially be mediated by preexisting anti-pig antibodies. Durable graft protection was achieved, and most of the late complications could be attributed to the immunosuppressive protocol. While fine tuning of immune suppression, tissue dose, and implantation techniques are still required, our results demonstrate that porcine E-42 embryonic pancreatic tissue can normalize blood glucose levels in primates. Its long-term proliferative capacity, its revascularization by host endothelium, and its reduced immunogenicity, strongly suggest that this approach could offer an attractive replacement therapy for diabetes.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2009-05-13", "authors": ["GilHecht", "SmadarEventov-Friedman", "ChavaRosen", "EliasShezen", "DalitTchorsh", "AnnaAronovich", "EnriqueFreud", "HanaGolan", "RonitEl-Hasid", "HelenaKatchman", "Bernhard JHering", "AmnonZung", "ZipiKra-Oz", "PninitShaked-Mishan", "AlexYusim", "AlexShtabsky", "PavelIdelevitch", "AnaTobar", "AlonHarmelin", "EstherBachar-Lustig", "YairReisner"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0812253106"}

The medial malleolus were completely defected (5 cases at left foot and 3 cases at right foot) and combined with the skin defect around the medial malleolus (4.0 cm x 2.0 cm - 9.5 cm x 5.5 cm). The time from injury to hospital admission was 6-8 hours in 2 cases, and 24-168 hours in 6 cases. The complex of vascularized fibular head epiphysis and tissue flap was adopted to repair the defect.

We compared the effect of inhibiting IL6 and VEGF on U87-derived experimental glioma grown on the chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) or in the brain of xenografted mice. Tumor growth was monitored by biomicroscopy and immunohistology. In vitro, IL6 knockdown had no effect on proliferation but substantially enhanced invasion. In the CAM experimental glioma, IL6 or VEGF knockdown reduced growth and vascularization of the tumors with a comparable efficiency, but increased invasion of residual tumor cells. In contrast, combined IL6/VEGF knockdown not only showed enhanced reduction of tumor growth and angiogenesis but also significantly prevented invasion of residual tumor cells. In mice, combining IL6 knockdown and Avastin treatment completely abrogated tumor development and infiltration. Molecular response of tumor cells to single or combined treatment was studied by transcriptomic profiling. Many cell cycle promoting genes and chromatin components were silenced in the double knockdown. In addition, specific migratory signatures detected in tumors under single IL6 or VEGF knockdown were partially erased in combined IL6/VEGF knockdown tumors.

Here we show that supernumerary teeth can form from multiple regions of the jaw and that they are properly mineralized, vascularized, innervated and can start to form roots. Even adult dental tissues can form new teeth in response to either epithelial Apc loss-of-function or beta-catenin activation, and the effect of Apc deficiency is mediated by beta-catenin. The formation of supernumerary teeth via Apc loss-of-function is non-cell-autonomous. A small number of Apc-deficient cells is sufficient to induce surrounding wild-type epithelial and mesenchymal cells to participate in the formation of new teeth. Strikingly, Msx1, which is necessary for endogenous tooth development, is dispensable for supernumerary tooth formation. In addition, we identify Fgf8, a known tooth initiation marker, as a direct target of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

Thus, sea bass transferrin and ferritin H cDNAs were isolated from liver, cloned and characterized. Transferrin constitutive expression was found to be highest in the liver, but also with significant expression in the brain, particularly in the highly vascularized region connecting the inferior lobe of the hypothalamus and the saccus vasculosus. Ferritin, on the other hand, was expressed in all tested organs, but also significantly higher in the liver. Fish were subjected to either experimental bacterial infection or iron modulation and transferrin and ferritin mRNA expression levels were analyzed, along with several iron regulatory parameters. Transferrin expression was found to decrease in the liver and increase in the brain in response to infection and to increase in the liver in iron deficiency. Ferritin expression was found to inversely reflect transferrin in the liver, increasing in infection and iron overload and decreasing in iron deficiency, whereas in the brain, ferritin expression was also increased in infection.

PlcHR, but not all its family members, is also a potent sphingomyelinase (SMase). Data presented herein indicate that picomolar (pM) concentrations of PlcHR are selectively lethal to endothelial cells (EC). An RGD motif of PlcHR contributes to this selectivity. Peptides containing an RGD motif (i.e., GRGDS), but not control peptides (i.e., GDGRS), block the effects of PlcHR on calcium signaling and cytotoxicity to EC. Moreover, RGD variants of PlcHR (e.g., RGE, KGD) are significantly reduced in their binding and toxicity, but retain the enzymatic activity of the wild type PlcHR. PlcHR also inhibits several EC-dependent in vitro assays (i.e., EC migration, EC invasion, and EC tubule formation), which represent key processes involved in angiogenesis (i.e., formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature). Finally, the impact of PlcHR in an in vivo model of angiogenesis in transgenic zebrafish, and ones treated with an antisense morpholino to knock down a key blood cell regulator, were evaluated because in vitro assays cannot fully represent the complex processes of angiogenesis. As little as 2 ng/embryo of PlcHR was lethal to approximately 50% of EGFP-labeled EC at 6 h after injection of embryos at 48 hpf (hours post-fertilization). An active site mutant of PlcHR (Thr178Ala) exhibited 120-fold reduced inhibitory activity in the EC invasion assay, and 20 ng/embryo elicited no detectable inhibitory activity in the zebrafish model. Taken together, these observations are pertinent to the distinctive vasculitis and poor wound healing associated with P. aeruginosa sepsis and suggest that the potent antiangiogenic properties of PlcHR are worthy of further investigation for the treatment of diseases where angiogenesis contributes pathological conditions (e.g., vascularization of tumors, diabetic retinopathy).", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "date": "2009-05-09", "authors": ["Michael LVasil", "Martin JStonehouse", "Adriana IVasil", "Sandra JWadsworth", "HowardGoldfine", "Robert EBolcome", "JoanneChan"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1000420"}

While Integra has been extensively studied in pre-clinical models, the re-modeling mechanisms of the capillary bed under these matrices are not well understood. Therefore, our first objective was to quantify the kinetics of re-vascularization.

The third objective was to establish a non-invasive and quantitative assay for the measurement of VP to facilitate the rapid and reproducible characterization of vascular integrity. Using an excisional wound model in mice, we characterize the appearance, growth, and maturation of blood vessels in an Integra graft over 28 days after surgery. Initial appearance of blood vessels in the graft was observed at 7 days, with angiogenesis peaking between 7 and 14 days. The onset of VP coincided with the increase in re-vascularization of the wound bed and there was a sustained elevation of VP that declined to baseline by 28 days.

Biomicroscopic examination showed that, at 1 week after one or two injections, GABPalpha/beta-treated eyes had significantly less neovascularized corneal area than did eyes treated with the empty vector. Histologic examination showed significantly less vascularized area and fewer blood vessels in the GABP-treated group at 1 week after injections.

In patients with multinodular thyroid gland, precise nodule mapping is necessary to allow accurate follow-up of each nodule, correctly identify which nodule(s) is hyper functioning on iodine scan (if done) and guide fine needle aspiration (FNA) of suspicious nodules. As such, all reports of US examinations for thyroid nodule(s) should include a diagram or map of the nodule(s). An evaluation of cervical lymph nodes also helps to determine the malignancy risk. The main US features for malignant adenopathy include: rounded lymph node, loss of normal echogenic fatty hilum, and loss of normal hilar vascularization. Several patterns are highly suggestive of thyroid cancer metastasis: microcalcifications, cystic components, hyperechoic nodes, mimicking thyroid tissue.

{"title": "Induced endothelial cells enhance osteogenesis and vascularization of mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Adequate vascularization remains one of the major challenges in bone tissue engineering. Since the microvascular endothelium is of benefit to osteogenesis and vascularization when in direct contact with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), we investigated whether endothelial cells induced from BM-MSCs have the same effect on BM-MSCs in vitro and in vivo. BM-MSCs were isolated, characterized and induced into endothelial-like cells (induced endothelial cells, IECs) in endothelial cell growth medium 2. BM-MSCs and IECs were co-cultured with direct contact. In vitro, IECs were evaluated in terms of their characteristics of endothelial cells and their effects on the osteogenic potential of BM-MSCs by cell morphology, immunofluorescent staining, alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin synthesis. In vivo, scaffolds consisting of beta-tricalcium phosphate co-seeded with IECs and BM-MSCs were transplanted into mouse dorsal pockets, and a histological analysis was performed to determine the extent of new bone and blood vessel formation. Isolated BM-MSCs were positive for the markers CD105 and CD29 and negative for hematopoietic markers CD34, CD45 and CD14. They were able to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes in respective media. Immunofluorescent analysis with von Willebrand factor and CD31 staining showed that BM-MSCs could differentiate into endothelial cells. The alkaline phosphatase activity and the osteocalcin content of the co-culture group were obviously higher than those of any other group (p < 0.05). Histologically, newly formed bone and vessels were more evident in the culture group (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that IECs could efficiently stimulate the in vitro differentiation of osteoblast-like cells and promote osteogenesis in vivo by direct contact with BM-MSCs.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2009-05-08", "authors": ["JieTao", "YuanSun", "Qiu-genWang", "Cheng-wenLiu"], "doi": "10.1159/000218139"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional reconstruction of the uterine vascular supply through vascular casting and thin slice computed tomography scanning.", "abstract": "It was the objective of this study to construct a model of the uterine vascular supply through vascular casting and thin slice computed tomography scanning. This will provide a teaching aide for the understanding of uterine artery embolization (UAE) procedures, as well as normal uterine and ovarian arterial anatomy. Using 20% chlorinated poly vinyl chloride, we infused and cast a set of a normal uterus, vagina and bilateral adnexa through the uterine artery and ovarian artery. After thin slice CT scanning, we obtained the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction by maximum intensity projection (MIP) and surface-shaded display (SSD), and then observed its figure and characteristics. A model of the uterine vascular supply can be successfully reconstructed by vascular casting and thin slice CT scanning. The 3D reconstruction offers a clear view of the course of the uterine artery and its blood supply distribution. It has two major branches: The intramuscular uterine branch and the cervicovaginal branch (1). Blood supply is generally unilateral, with communicating branches between the two sides and possible anastomoses between the arterial blood supply of the uterus and the ovaries. The major blood supply of the cervix comes from the cervicovaginal branch of the uterine artery, while the vaginal arterial supply derives directly from the internal iliac artery. The CT technique allows real-time 360 degrees rotation and changes in model for in-depth study of the vascular network and its adjacent tissues. It is possible to construct an in vitro uterine arterial network by vascular casting and CT scanning, which can provide unique insight into the female genitourinary system arterial network. Based on this, we can create reconstructions as well as models for different diseases such as leiomyomata, adenomyosis, and endometrial cancer.

In this work we assessed the impact of germ line haploinsufficiency of the pRb gene (Rb) on the response to high-fat diet feeding in mice. Rb(+/-) mice had body weight and adiposity indistinguishable from that of wild-type (Rb(+/+)) littermates when maintained on a standard diet, yet they gained less body weight and body fat after long-term high-fat diet feeding coupled with reduced feed efficiency and increased rectal temperature. Rb haploinsufficiency ameliorated insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis after high-fat diet in male mice, in which these disturbances were more marked than in females. Compared with wild-type littermates, Rb(+/-) mice fed a high-fat diet displayed higher expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma as well as of genes involved in mitochondrial function, cAMP sensitivity, brown adipocyte determination, and tissue vascularization in white adipose tissue depots. Furthermore, Rb(+/-) mice exhibited signs of enhanced activation of brown adipose tissue and higher expression levels of PPARalpha in liver and of PPARdelta in skeletal muscle, suggestive of an increased capability for fatty acid oxidation in these tissues. These findings support a role for pRb in modulating whole body energy metabolism and the plasticity of the adipose tissues in vivo and constitute first evidence that partial deficiency in the Rb gene protects against the development of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We explored this issue by transplanting mouse C2C12 myoblasts, genetically engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or eGFP and relaxin (eGFP/RLX), into swine with chronic myocardial infarction. One month later, C2C12 myoblasts selectively settled in the ischemic scar around blood vessels, showing an activated endothelium (ICAM-1 and VCAM positive). Although unable to differentiate to a muscle phenotype, these cells induced extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling by matrix metalloprotease secretion and increased microvessel density by vascular endothelial growth factor expression. C2C12/RLX myoblasts gave better results than C2C12/GFP. By echocardiography, C2C12-engrafted swine, especially those that received C2C12/RLX, showed better heart contractility than the untreated controls.

{"title": "Differential gene expression in models of pituitary prolactin-producing tumoral cells.", "abstract": "Although several genes and signalling pathways have been identified as important effectors in the development of pituitary tumours, our understanding of pituitary tumorigenesis remains incomplete and is the focus of much current research. Use of the mRNA differential display technique in prolactinomas from D2-receptor knockout mice and in stable GH3 cell line clones with enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo has led to the identification of two genes that are involved in the pathogenic process--BMP-4 and RSUME. Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) has been found to have a crucial role in prolactinoma development and also in signalling crosstalk with oestrogens. In contrast, BMP-4 has an inhibitory role in corticotrophinomas. RSUME (RWD-containing sumoylation enhancer) was identified from a transformed lactosomatotrophic cell line that had increased tumorigenic and angiogenic potential. Expression of RSUME was induced under hypoxic conditions and it has a potential role during vascularization. The differential expression and action of BMP-4 in prolactinomas and corticotrophinomas highlights the importance of studying a gene with contrasting actions in two cell lineages of the same organ in order to understand the pituitary transformation process.

Our aim was to study the effects of FGF-8b on proliferation of PC-3 prostate cancer cells and growth of PC-3 tumors, and to identify FGF-8b-associated molecular targets. Expression of ectopic FGF-8b in PC-3 cells caused a 1.5-fold increase in cell proliferation in vitro and a four- to fivefold increase in the size of subcutaneous and orthotopic prostate tumors in nude mice. Tumors expressing FGF-8b showed a characteristic morphology with a very rich network of capillaries. This was associated with increased spread of the cancer cells to the lungs as measured by RT-qPCR of FGF-8b mRNA. Microarray analyses revealed significantly altered, up- and downregulated, genes in PC-3 cell cultures (169 genes) and in orthotopic PC-3 tumors (61 genes). IPA network analysis of the upregulated genes showed the strongest association with development, cell proliferation (CRIP1, SHC1), angiogenesis (CCL2, DDAH2), bone metastasis (SPP1), cell-to-cell signaling and energy production, and the downregulated genes associated with differentiation (DKK-1, VDR) and cell death (CYCS). The changes in gene expression were confirmed by RT-qPCR. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that FGF-8b increases the growth and angiogenesis of orthotopic prostate tumors.

Type XXVII and type XI collagens are also expressed in cartilage during endochondral ossification, and so enhancer/reporter assays were used to determine whether Lc-Maf could regulate cartilage-specific enhancers from the Col27a1 and Col11a2 genes. The Col27a1 enhancer was upregulated over 4-fold by Lc-Maf, while the Col11a2 enhancer was downregulated slightly. To confirm the results of these reporter assays, rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells were transiently transfected with an Lc-Maf expression plasmid, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of endogenous Col27a1 and Col11a2 genes. Endogenous Col27a1 was upregulated 6-fold by Lc-Maf overexpression, while endogenous Col11a2 was unchanged. Finally, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed in the radius and ulna of embryonic day 17 mouse forelimbs undergoing endochondral ossification. Results demonstrated that Lc-Maf and Col27a1 mRNAs are coexpressed in proliferating and prehypertrophic regions, as would be predicted if Lc-Maf regulates Col27a1 expression. Type XXVII collagen protein was also most abundant in prehypertrophic and proliferating chondrocytes. Others have shown that mice that are null for Lc-Maf and c-Maf have expanded hypertrophic regions with reduced ossification and delayed vascularization.

The histomorphometric observation of the skeletal muscle fibers was submitted to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison test, with a level of significance set at P < 0.05, which showed that the amount of skeletal muscle fiber formed had significantly increased in the group treated by scalpel in comparison with that in the groups treated by electrocautery (P < 0.01), CO(2) laser irradiation (P < 0.001) and Nd:YAG laser irradiation (P < 0.01) on the 14th postoperative day. A gradual increase in skeletal muscle fibers formed during the healing process was observed in all groups.

Recently, exposure to moderate-intensity static magnetic fields (1 mT to 1 T) has attracted much attention for its potential therapeutic value as a noninvasive intervening method. Nevertheless, the effects of moderate-intensity and spatial gradient static magnetic fields (GSMF) on angiogenesis have not received enough attention. In this study, the effects of GSMF (0.2-0.4 T, 2.09 T/m, 1-11 days) on angiogenesis were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. An MTT assay was used as an in vitro method to detect the proliferation ability of human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Two kinds of in vivo models, a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and a matrigel plug, were used to detect the effects of GSMF on angiogenesis. The results showed that the proliferation ability of HUVECs was significantly inhibited 24 h after the onset of exposure. With regard to the CAM model, vascular numbers in the CAM that was continuously exposed to the GSMF were all less than those in normal condition. In accordance with the gross appearance, the contents of hemoglobin in the models exposed to GSMF for 7-9 days were also less. In addition, similar to the CAM model, the results of vascular density and hemoglobin contents in the matrigel plug also demonstrated that the GSMF exposure for 7 or 11 days inhibited vascularization. These findings indicate that GSMF might inhibit or prevent new blood vessels formation and could be helpful for the treatment of some diseases relevant to pathological angiogenesis.", "journal": "Bioelectromagnetics", "date": "2009-05-01", "authors": ["ZheWang", "PengfeiYang", "HuiyunXu", "AirongQian", "LifangHu", "PengShang"], "doi": "10.1002/bem.20501"}

Antiangiogenic therapy has achieved some effectiveness against this unique malignancy. The complexity of the tumor vasculature in CCRCC has led to differences in correlating tumor microvessel density with patient prognosis. The authors' recent findings demonstrated that there were at least 2 major categories of tumor vessels in CCRCC-namely, undifferentiated and differentiated-correlating with patient prognosis in contrasting ways, with higher undifferentiated vessel density indicating poorer prognosis, and higher differentiated vessel density correlating with better prognosis. Furthermore, the presence of pericytes supporting the differentiated vessels varied in CCRCC. The distributions of pericyte coverage and differentiated vessels in CCRCC were uneven. The tumor margin had a higher pericyte coverage rate for differentiated vessels than did the inner tumor area. The uneven distributions of pericyte coverage and differentiated vessels in CCRCC prompted the authors to revisit the mechanism of tumor central necrosis, which was also known to be a prognostic indicator for CCRCC. The discrepancy of prognostic correlation between protein and messenger RNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in CCRCC was discussed.

To analyze the specific role of MC-derived HS in this process, we inactivated HS synthesis in MCs. MC-specific loss of HS causes embryonic lethality associated with vascular patterning defects, edema, and hemorrhages during late gestation. MC recruitment in the skin is impaired, correlating with defective PDGFR-beta and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-SMAD signaling. Accumulation of rounded cells positive for MC markers close to the vessels indicates defective polarization and migration of local MC progenitors. In contrast, MC recruitment and signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) are unaffected by MC HS loss. Our results suggest that HS is selectively required in a cell-autonomous manner, acting in cis with PDGFR-beta and TGF-beta receptors during induction/polarization and migration of local progenitor cells to the nascent vessel.

{"title": "Fascicular turnover flap for nerve gaps.", "abstract": "It is well known that free vascularised nerve grafts have a potential for rapid axonal sprouting. However, they are not very popular as the surgical techniques are complicated. With the recent development of supramicrosurgical techniques and microanatomy of nerve trunks, a new method, 'fascicular turnover method', using vascularised fascicular flap was used for repairing nerve gaps. METHODSAND RESULTS: Arterial embalming method, using rat sciatic nerves, was employed to observe fascicular micro-vascularisation. Rich vascular network systems were observed within and outside the rat island nerve flaps. Four cases with digital and facial nerves gaps were repaired with fascicular turnover flap without a nerve graft. Three patients had digital nerve gaps (10-20mm in length) and one had a 3-cm facial nerve gap. The results of sensory recovery of digital nerve gap were 3.22-3.66 (Semmes-Weinstein values) and 6-12mm (moving two-point discriminations) at 6 and -16 months after surgery, respectively.\nThe advantages of this method are: retention of the normal donor nerve, a shorter operation time and repair of the digital nerve gaps under local anaesthesia. Fascicular flap is a vascularised nerve flap with fast and accurate nerve sprouting in comparison to a non-vascularised graft. Excellent nerve regeneration can be expected even in cases with longer nerve gap and scarred recipient bed. It is a simple and quick surgery compared to free vascularised nerve flaps.

Examination of the fetal testes revealed significant alterations in vascularization and seminiferous tubule development after short-term CQ treatment. Anogenital distance was not altered.

For large volume breast reconstruction, a Wise-pattern skin resection may provide very good aesthetic results; however, the submuscular implant pocket is inadequate to cover the inferior pole of the breast. In this patient population, the risk of implant exposure from T-point breakdown is significant. We present our technique of Wise-pattern breast reconstruction using AlloDerm (LifeCell, Branchburg, NJ) and a vascularized dermal-subcutaneous pedicle (DSP) to augment the volume and quality of immediate breast implant coverage, particularly in the area of the T-point suture lines. We reviewed a series of 20 consecutive patients with large breasts who were treated with an immediate implant reconstruction of greater than 400 mL volume using the Wise-pattern with DSP. Preoperative and postoperative 3-dimensional surface scan studies were performed to evaluate breast symmetry. The average volume of breast reconstruction in this study group was 458 mL. T-point breakdown occurred in 5 patients (25%). These patients were treated with local wound care and healed with an excellent aesthetic result. None of these patients required implant removal, implant exchange, or operative debridement. Pre- and postoperative 3-dimensional surface scan analysis of these patients demonstrated comparable differences between the affected and unaffected sides in women undergoing immediate breast implant reconstruction when compared with a matched group of patients undergoing 2-stage breast reconstruction with tissue expanders. Wise-pattern skin-reducing mastectomy is an excellent strategy to provide an aesthetically pleasing, immediate implant breast reconstruction. This technique provides breast symmetry that is at least comparable to that of tissue expander-based, staged implant reconstructions. The reliability of the Wise-pattern technique is significantly improved with the addition of AlloDerm to the muscular pocket and a vascularized DSP to preserve the integrity of the reconstruction in the presence of T-point breakdown.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2009-04-24", "authors": ["Christopher ADerderian", "Nolan SKarp", "MihyeChoi"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181a0cfee"}

Some studies have addressed different issues that may enhance vascularisation in tissue engineered constructs, most of them involving the use of growth factors (GFs) that are involved in the restitution of the vascularity in a damaged zone. The use of sustained delivery systems might also play an important role in the re-establishment of angiogenesis. In this study, kappa-carrageenan, a naturally occurring polymer, was used to develop hydrogel beads with the ability to incorporate GFs with the purpose of establishing an effective angiogenesis mechanism. Some processing parameters were studied and their influence on the final bead properties was evaluated. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) was selected as the angiogenic factor to incorporate in the developed beads, and the results demonstrate the achievement of an efficient encapsulation and controlled release profile matching those usually required for the development of a fully functional vascular network.

{"title": "Salvage of failed treatment of femoral neck fractures.", "abstract": "The number of patients treated for femoral neck fractures continues to increase. Although most fractures will heal, reported rates of nonunion and osteonecrosis are cause for concern; therefore, implementation of effective salvage strategies is important. The choice of salvage strategy generally is guided by patient age, remaining bone quality, the status of the articular surface of the hip joint, and the viability of the femoral head. Nonunions in patients younger than 60 years are typically treated with valgus-producing osteotomies, which convert shear forces to compressive forces and have demonstrated relatively high union rates. The role of various vascularized and nonvascularized bone grafts remains undefined. Nonunions in patients older than 60 years are typically salvaged with some form of hip arthroplasty. Both hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty can be effective. Surgical challenges include osteopenic bone; bony defects from hardware; and contracted, scarred, and shortened limbs.

{"title": "Detection of different tumor growth kinetics in single transgenic mice with oncogene-induced mammary carcinomas by flat-panel volume computed tomography.", "abstract": "Transgenic mouse models offer an excellent opportunity for studying the molecular basis of cancer development and progression. Here we applied flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT) to monitor tumor progression as well as the development of tumor vasculature in vivo in a transgenic mouse model for oncogene-induced mammary carcinogenesis (WAP-T mice). WAP-T mice develop multiple mammary carcinomas on oncogene induction within 3 to 5 months. Following induction, 3-dimensional fpVCT data sets were obtained by serial single scans of entire mice in combination with iodine containing contrast agents and served as basis for precise measurements of tumor volumes. Thereby, we were able to depict tumors within the mammary glands at a very early stage of the development. Tumors of small sizes (0.001 cm(3)) were detected by fpVCT before being palpable or visible by inspection. The capability to determine early tumor onset combined with longitudinal noninvasive imaging identified diverse time points of tumor onset for each mammary carcinoma and different tumor growth kinetics for multiple breast carcinomas that developed in single mice. Furthermore, blood supply to the breast tumors, as well as blood vessels around and within the tumors, were clearly visible over time by fpVCT. Three-dimensional visualization of tumor vessels in high resolution was enhanced by the use of a novel blood pool contrast agent. Here, we demonstrate by longitudinal fpVCT imaging that mammary carcinomas develop at different time points in each WAP-T mouse, and thereafter show divergent growth rates and distinct vascularization patterns.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2009-04-23", "authors": ["KatharinaJannasch", "ChristianDullin", "ChristinaHeinlein", "FraukeKrepulat", "FlorianWegwitz", "WolfgangDeppert", "FraukeAlves"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.24332"}
{"title": "Resident vascular progenitor cells: an emerging role for non-terminally differentiated vessel-resident cells in vascular biology.", "abstract": "Throughout development and adult life the vasculature exhibits a remarkably dynamic capacity for growth and repair. The vasculature also plays a pivotal role in the execution of other diverse biologic processes, such as the provisioning of early hematopoietic stem cells during embryonic development or the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. Adding to this importance, from an anatomical perspective, the vasculature is clearly an omnipresent organ, with few areas of the body that it does not penetrate. Given these impressive characteristics, it is perhaps to be expected that the vasculature should require, or at least be associated with, a ready supply of stem and progenitor cells. However, somewhat surprisingly, it is only now just beginning to be broadly appreciated that the vasculature plays host to a range of vessel-resident stem and progenitor cells. The possibility that these vessel-resident cells are implicated in processes as diverse as tumor vascularization and adaptive vascular remodeling appears likely, and several exciting avenues for clinical translation are already under investigation.

Since 1981, 21 vascularized nerve grafts, other than vascularized ulnar nerve, were used for reconstruction of nerve injuries in the upper extremity.

Despite this known association, the precise mechanism of disease remains unknown. Using a rat model of IPF, we explored the role of the proangiogenic and antiapoptotic growth factor VEGF in the vascular remodeling that underlies PH. In this model, adenoviral delivery of active TGF-beta1 induces pulmonary arterial remodeling, loss of the microvasculature in fibrotic areas, and increased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). Immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis revealed decreased levels of VEGF and its receptor, which were inversely correlated with PAP and endothelial cell apoptosis in both the micro- and macrovasculature. Treatment of IPF rats with adenoviral delivery of VEGF resulted in reduced endothelial apoptosis, increased vascularization, and improved PAP due to reduced remodeling but worsened PF. These data show that experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) leads to loss of the microvasculature through increased apoptosis and to remodeling of the pulmonary arteries, with both processes resulting in PH.

{"title": "Vascularized free fibular bone graft in the management of congenital tibial pseudarthrosis.", "abstract": "Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) remains one of the most challenging problems confronting the orthopaedic surgeon. The operative results are frequently less than successful; many cases require several surgical procedures, and a significant number of them ending in amputation. The purpose of this study was to access the surgical results, complications, secondary procedures, and long-term results of free vascularized fibular graft (FVFG) in the treatment of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Between 1992 and 2007, nine patients with CPT were treated consecutively at our clinic with free fibula transfer. There were six females and three males. The mean age at the time of operation was 6.5 years (range, 1-12 years). Stability, after reconstruction with FVFG, was maintained with internal fixation in five patients, unilateral frame external fixation in three patients, and intramedullary pin in one patient. Average postoperative follow-up time was 9 years (range, 2-15 years). In seven patients, both ends of the graft healed primarily within 3.7 months (range, 1.5-6 months). In one patient, the distal end of the graft did not unit. This patient required three subsequent operations to achieve union. Stress fracture occurred in the middle of the grafted fibula in one patient, who underwent four additional operations before union, was achieved.

The surrounding soft tissue in these situations is often compromised due to radiation exposure or infection. In these situations, in which conventional bone grafting has often failed, we have found vascularized fibular grafts an effective method of achieving bony union. The purpose of this study was to review the results of vascularized bone grafting for complex spinal reconstruction using free fibular transfer.\nWe performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent multisegmental spinal reconstruction and pelvic reconstruction using posterior instrumentation and free fibula vascularized bone transfer.\nTwelve patients underwent 14 free fibula transfers (7 anterior and 5 posteriorly placed) for reconstruction of lumbosacral spinal defects. Preoperative diagnoses included tumor, osteomyelitis, and nonunion. Average number of vertebral body resections was four and posterior instrumentation was used for all arthrodeses. Average duration of follow up was 45 months. Two flaps failed (14%), one resulting in nonunion and the other required salvage with an external hemipelvectomy. All remaining flaps healed at a mean time of 4.5 months (range, 3-10 months).\nFree fibula transfer for complex spinal reconstruction is a reliable means of obtaining bony union for complex lumbar or sacral resections where traditional bone grafting techniques may not be technically feasible.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2009-04-21", "authors": ["Steven LMoran", "KarimBakri", "SamirMardini", "Alexander YShin", "Allen TBishop"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.20655"}

The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor (CXC chemokine receptor 4, CXCR4) play a critical role in the process of post-natal neovascularization. The SDF-1-CXCR4 axis is a potential mechanism for the treatment of ischemic limb. Here, we investigated the role of CXCR4 in bone marrow cells (BMCs) in neovascularization induced by tumor cells and the supernatant of culture media in a murine hind-limb ischemia model which was made by resecting femoral artery and vein. After the injection of mouse melanoma cells B16-F10 (1x10(6) cells in 0.1 mL at the operation day, s.c.) into the abdomen or the cell culture supernatant (0.1 mL/d for 21 d after operation, i.m.) into the ischemic abductor muscle, the CXCR4 positive BMCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The perfusion of the ischemic limb was evaluated by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) on 7, 14 and 21 d after vascular injury operation. Capillary endothelial alkaline phosphatase (AP) was stained to quantify the presence of capillaries, and histological method was used to evaluate the capillary density as a measure of neovascularization in ischemic tissues. The proportions of CXCR4 positive BMCs were notably higher in ischemic limb injected with tumor cells or the supernatant compared to those in the control group (P<0.05). Injection of tumor cells or the supernatant resulted in significantly improved perfusion as measured by LDPI perfusion ratios on 7, 14 and 21 d after femoral artery and vein resection in mice, compared to the controls (P<0.05). Tissue samples harvested from the lower calf muscle at day 21 demonstrated increased capillary densities in mice receiving tumor cells (0.81+/-0.13) or the supernatant (0.63+/-0.05), compared with those in control group (0.44+/-0.09, P<0.05).

All were given for 4 weeks. The serum steroid hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. The total weight and thickness of the bladder were measured. Morphologic changes were observed under light and electron microscopy. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the bladder was evaluated by immmohistochemistry and Western blotting.\nThe ovariectomized rats had a thinner bladder wall compared with the sham group (0.97 +/- 0.11 mm vs 1.10 +/- 0.10 mm, P < .05) and widened spaces between the detrusor muscle fascicles with collagen deposit. Estrogen reversed these changes, and testosterone increased the thickness of the bladder wall to 1.26 +/- 0.12 mm (P < .05). VEGF staining was mainly located in the urothelium and endothelial cells, with weak staining in the smooth muscles. VEGF was almost absent in the urothelium after ovariectomy. In the estrogen- and androgen-treated groups, although the expression of VEGF was significantly greater than that in the nontreated ovariectomized group, it was still lower than normal.\nOur findings suggest the importance of steroid hormones in maintaining the integrity of the bladder structure and regulating the expression of VEGF in the female urinary tract. Both estrogen and androgen can reverse the bladder muscle atrophy induced by ovariectomy.

Rats underwent a surgical procedure to create hindlimb ischemia and were injected with a combination of plasmids that expressed FGF-2 and PDGF-BB. Anatomical and functional parameters of the angiogenesis and arteriogenesis response were evaluated after 4 weeks. The results were compared with rats injected with plasmids that expressed a reporter gene or the extensively studied vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) alone. Treatment with the FGF-2/PDGF-BB combination increased the angiogenesis and arteriogenesis response compared with the empty plasmid, and it was as effective as VEGF165. In terms of safety, the combination allowed the use of a 50% lower individual dose of each plasmid and in addition promoted the formation of more stable vessels than VEGF165.

A 10-year-old female spayed domestic shorthaired cat was presented with a 2-month history of nonhealing, crusting, erosive and ulcerative skin lesions on the dorsal right forepaw. Severe chewing and biting, but not lameness, had been reported. Systemic abnormalities were not noted. Histopathology revealed increased numbers of thin-walled and slightly grouped vascular profiles in the superficial and mid-dermis, which were often markedly dilated and partially obscured by prominent hyaline deposits. There were a few pyknotic nuclear fragments and haemorrhages in vascular walls as well as multifocal luminal thrombosis with or without recanalization. Differential diagnoses included progressive angiomatosis with trauma or AVF with secondary regional venous hypertension. Computed tomographic images were acquired using a 16-slice Siemens Somotom Sensation CT scanner, and 3D images were created using the Voxar 3D software.

In vitro investigations of the antiangiogenic activities of TRF, delta-tocotrienol (deltaT3), and alpha-tocopherol (alphaToc) were carried out in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). TRF and deltaT3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation from 4 microg/ml onward (P < 0.05). Cell migration was inhibited the most by deltaT3 at 12 microg/ml. Anti-angiogenic properties of TRF were carried out further in vivo using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and BALB/c mice model. TRF at 200 microg/ml reduced the vascular network on CAM. TRF treatment of 1 mg/mouse significantly reduced 4T1 tumor volume in BALB/c mice.

{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinase-activated anthrax lethal toxin inhibits endothelial invasion and neovasculature formation during in vitro morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Solid tumor growth is dependent on angiogenesis, the formation of neovasculature from existing vessels. Endothelial activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways is central to this process, and thus presents an attractive target for the development of angiogenesis inhibitors. Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) has potent catalytic mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition activity. Preclinical studies showed that LeTx induced potent tumor growth inhibition via the inhibition of xenograft vascularization. However, LeTx receptors and the essential furin-like activating proteases are expressed in many normal tissues, potentially limiting the specificity of LeTx as an antitumor agent. To circumvent nonspecific LeTx activation and simultaneously enhance tumor vascular targeting, a substrate preferably cleaved by the gelatinases class of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) was substituted for the furin LeTx activation site. In vivo efficacy studies showed that this MMP-activated LeTx inhibited tumor xenografts growth via the reduced migration of endothelial cells into the tumor parenchyma. Here we have expanded on these initial findings by showing that this MMP-activated LeTx reduces endothelial proangiogenic MMP expression, thus causing a diminished proteolytic capacity for extracellular matrix remodeling and endothelial differentiation into capillary networks. Additionally, our data suggest that inhibition of the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and p38, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, pathways is significant in the antiangiogenic activity of the MMP-activated LeTx.

{"title": "Hibernating myocardium: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.", "abstract": "Comprehensive management of patients with chronic ischemic disease is a critically important component of clinical practice. Cardiac myocytes have the potential to adapt to limited flow conditions by adjusting contractile function, reducing metabolism, conserving resources, and preserving myocardial integrity to cope with an oxygen and (or) nutrition shortage. A prime metabolic feature of cardiac myocytes affected by chronic ischemia is the return to a fetal gene pattern with predominance of carbohydrates as the substrate for energy. Structural adaptation with multiple intracellular changes is part of the remodeling process in hibernating myocardium. Transmural heterogeneity, which defines the pattern of injury in ventricular cardiomyocytes and the response to chronic ischemia, is a multifactorial process originating from functional, metabolic, and flow differences in subendocardial and subepicardial regions. Autophagy is typically activated in hibernating myocardium and has been identified as a prosurvival mechanism. Chronic ischemia is associated with changes in the number, size, and distribution of gap junctions and may give rise to conduction disturbances and arrhythmogenesis. Differentiation between viable and nonviable myocardium by assessing sensitivity of inotropic reserve is a crucial diagnostic tool that is correlated with the prognosis and outcome for improved contractility after restoration of blood perfusion in afflicted myocardium.Reliable and accurate diagnosis of ischemic, scar, and viable tissues is critical for recover strategies. Although early surgical reinstitution of blood flow is most effective in restoring physiologic function of the hibernating myocardium, several new approaches offer promising alternatives. Among others, vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), especially its lo-FGF-2 isoform, have been shown to be effective in rapid neovascularization. Substances such as statins, resveratrol, some hormones, and omega-3 fatty acids can improve recovery effect in chronically underperfused hearts. For patients with drug-refractory ischemia, intramyocardial transplantation of stem cells into predefined areas of the heart can enhance vascularization and have beneficial effects on cardiac function.

{"title": "Chemoprevention of tocotrienols: the mechanism of antiproliferative effects.", "abstract": "Tocotrienols have been reported as antitumor agents and widely commercialized as an antioxidant dietary supplement. Tocotrienols have more significant biological activity than tocopherols, although serum level of tocotrienols is much lower than that of tocopherols. This may be because intracellular concentration of tocotrienols was revealed to be significantly higher compared with tocopherols, and tocotrienol accumulation is observed in tumor. Previous reports have suggested antiproliferative effect, induction of apoptosis, modulation of cell cycle, antioxidant activity, inhibition of angiogenesis, and suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase activity as anticarcinogenesis mechanisms of tocotrienols both in vivo and in vitro. Extension of the duration of host survival was observed in tumor-implanted mice treated with tocotrienol. Tocotrienols induce apoptosis mainly via mitochondria-mediated pathway. Cell cycle arrest is due to suppression of cyclin D by tocotrienols. Tocotrienols also inhibit vascularization-reducing proliferation, migration and tube formation. Malignant proliferation demands elevation of HMG CoA reductase activity, and tocotrienols suppress its activity. Tocotrienol treatment decreases oncogene expression and increases the level of tumor suppressors. Only a few clinical trials to determine the effects of tocotrienol on cancer prevention or treatment have been carried out. There is no convincing or probable evidence of the role of tocotrienols in cancer prevention, while alpha-tocopherol has been suggested to have a limited anti-prostate cancer potential. Neither beneficial activity nor adverse effect of tocotrienol has sufficiently been explored so far.

Therefore, we analyzed the expression of MTA1 and MTA3 in normal human placenta tissues and the chorionic cancer cell lines BeWo, JEG, and JAR. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a rather strong expression of MTA1 and MTA3 in the nuclei of human trophoblast cells. A high expression level of MTA1 and MTA3 was further observed in the nuclei of human chorionic carcinoma cells, as shown by immunofluorescence analysis, and confirmed by Western blot and RT-PCR analysis.

In order to construct such a vascular system, we attempted to create a scaffold material that induces neovascular growth from the recipient bed into the material. This material, an ion complex gel matrix (IC gel) consisting of collagen and a citric acid derivative, enabled it to associate with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The IC gel was implanted in the subfascial space of the rat rectus muscle and excised 5 days later. Cross-sections of the excised samples were stained for von Willebrand factor, and then neovascular development into the gel was observed and also quantified by image analysis. These data showed that the IC gel markedly induced growth of vascular-rich tissue into the inside of the gel by day 5, which surpassed that after implantation of Matrigel or gelated collagen. Further, combination with bFGF significantly enhanced the vascularization ability of IC gel. These findings suggest that IC gel functioned as a scaffold material for neovascular ingrowth and a reservoir of bFGF.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2009-04-14", "authors": ["ToshioTakayama", "TetsushiTaguchi", "HiroyukiKoyama", "MatomoSakari", "WataruKamimura", "TsuyoshiTakato", "TetsuroMiyata", "HirokazuNagawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.03.026"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of administration of a GnRH analogue to cows with ovarian follicular cysts on plasma renin concentrations and ovarian vascularization. This study was performed with 60 Friesian cows, which were diagnosed with follicular cysts, and randomly allocated into two groups: group A (treatment; n=30) received 2ml of lecirelin (Dalmarelin((R)) - Fatro), per head via sacro-coccygeal epidural, and group B (control; n=30) received 2ml saline solution (0.9% NaCl) per head by the same route. Blood samples were immediately collected prior to administration (T0) and then 24h (T1), 48h (T2) and 8 days (T3) after administration of the treatment, for both groups. Ovarian vascularization was evaluated utilizing Power Doppler on these same days in 10 animals from each group. The number of pixels detected by Power Doppler was used as an indicator of the degree of vascularization. Plasma renin concentrations remained relatively constant for the control (group B) animals, but increased as the sampling period progressed (NS) for the treated cows (group A). Similarly, there were no changes in ovarian vascularization (number of pixels) for the control cows, but vascularization increased throughout the sampling period in the treated animals. The number of pixels associated with cysts was significantly higher for treated compared to control cows at 24h after treatment (P<0.001). The epidural administration of a GnRH analogue was determined to be a highly effective therapy for follicular cysts (regression occurred in 82% of treated cows within 8+/-2 days after treatment, but in none of the control cows), which also enhanced ovarian vascularization.", "journal": "Animal reproduction science", "date": "2009-04-14", "authors": ["ARizzo", "GMinoia", "CTrisolini", "MMutinati", "MSpedicato", "RManca", "R LSciorsci"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.02.016"}

The principle of biological osteosynthesis was worked out, which, in contrast to AO original concept, implies the indirect (closed) reduction and \"bridge-like\" (elastic) fixation, without intervening on fracture area, and additionally, with maximally preserved vascularization of intermediate fragments. The study objective implied the consideration and analysis of the results of biological osteosynthesis, performed on multifragmental extra-articular fractures of lower limb long tubular bones, also to determine the indications and advantages of different methods of biological osteosynthesis. 117 patients with 153 fractures of lower limb long bones were treated by the method of biological osteosynthesis in the Department of Traumatology and Orthopedics of the Central University Clinic, in the period of 2000-2008. In 75 cases, osteosynthesis was accomplished through an external fixator, and in remaining 78 cases - by different kinds of plates. In 143 cases (93.5%), the complete fracture consolidation was achieved, requiring the average dates of 4.4 months for tibial and 4.9 months for femoral fractures, respectively. The secondary, i.e. repeated osteosynthesis with plate was required in 10 cases (6.5%). In case of biological osteosynthesis, the consolidation process gains the maximally physiological course, without lysing the intermediate fragments, and with development of endosteal-periosteal callus having the rigid framework.

When SLN is free of metastasis, complete axillary dissection may be skipped for staging in clinically N0 patients, allowing a more conservative procedure. Histological tumor features that could reliably predict SLN status have not yet been established. Since the degree of tumor lymphangiogenesis and vascularization may theoretically be related to the risk of lymph node metastasis, we sought to evaluate the relationship between lymph vessel invasion (LVI), lymphatic microvascular density (LVD), microvascular density (MVD) and VEGF-A expression, with SLN status and other known adverse clinical risk factors.\nProtein expression of D2-40, CD34, and VEGF-A was assessed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections of primary breast cancer specimens from 92 patients submitted to SLN investigation.

Contrast specific ultrasound modalities are currently used with excellent results in oncology, in cardiology and in vascular diseases.

LDD is a rare cerebellar mass lesion which may be associated with Cowden's syndrome and the PTEN germline mutation.\nA 61-year-old male presented 15 years before with a transient episode of unspecific gait disturbance. Initial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a right-sided, diffuse, nonenhancing cerebellar mass lesion. No definitive diagnosis was made at that time, and the symptoms resolved spontaneously. 15 years later, the patient presented with acute onset of vomiting associated with headache and ataxic gait. MR imaging showed a progression of the lesion with occlusive hydrocephalus. The lesion depicted a striated pattern characteristic for LDD with T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense bands, nonenhancing with contrast. After resection of the mass lesion, the cerebellar and hydrocephalic symptoms improved rapidly. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of dysplastic gangliocytoma (WHO Grade I) with enlarged granular and molecular cell layers, reactive gliosis and dysplastic blood vessels. No other clinical features associated with Cowden's syndrome were present.\nThis case illustrates that LDD with atypical vascularization is a slow-growing posterior fossa mass lesion which may remain asymptomatic for many years.

{"title": "Mesenchymal stem cell transition to tumor-associated fibroblasts contributes to fibrovascular network expansion and tumor progression.", "abstract": "Tumor associated fibroblasts (TAF), are essential for tumor progression providing both a functional and structural supportive environment. TAF, known as activated fibroblasts, have an established biological impact on tumorigenesis as matrix synthesizing or matrix degrading cells, contractile cells, and even blood vessel associated cells. The production of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, matrix-degrading enzymes, and immunomodulatory mechanisms by these cells augment tumor progression by providing a suitable environment. There are several suggested origins of the TAF including tissue-resident, circulating, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transitioned cells.\nWe provide evidence that TAF are derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that acquire a TAF phenotype following exposure to or systemic recruitment into adenocarcinoma xenograft models including breast, pancreatic, and ovarian. We define the MSC derived TAF in a xenograft ovarian carcinoma model by the immunohistochemical presence of 1) fibroblast specific protein and fibroblast activated protein; 2) markers phenotypically associated with aggressiveness, including tenascin-c, thrombospondin-1, and stromelysin-1; 3) production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-6; and 4) factors indicative of vascularization, including alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and vascular endothelial growth factor. We demonstrate that under long-term tumor conditioning in vitro, MSC express TAF-like proteins. Additionally, human MSC but not murine MSC stimulated tumor growth primarily through the paracrine production of secreted IL6.\nOur results suggest the dependence of in vitro Skov-3 tumor cell proliferation is due to the presence of tumor-stimulated MSC secreted IL6.

Cardiomyocyte size and vascularisation were determined at different time points. Expression differences were investigated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. In addition, the effects of PPARbeta stimulation were compared with hearts of mice undergoing long-term voluntary exercise or pharmacological PPARalpha activation. Five hours after GW0742 injection, we detected an enhanced angiogenesis compared with vehicle-injected controls. After 24 h, the heart-to-body weight ratios were higher in mice injected with either GW0742 or GW501516 vs. controls. The increased heart size was due to cardiomyocyte enlargement. No signs of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (i.e. apoptosis, fibrosis, or deteriorated cardiac function) could be detected. The effects are mediated via calcineurin A (CnA) activation as: (i) CnA was upregulated, (ii) GW0742 administration or co-transfection of PPARbeta significantly stimulated the activity of the CnA promoter, (iii) PPARbeta protein bound directly to the CnA promoter, (iv) the CnA target genes NFATc3, Hif-1alpha, and Cdk 9 were upregulated in response to PPARbeta stimulation, and (v) the inhibition of CnA activity by cyclosporine A abolished the hypertrophic and angiogenic responses to PPARbeta stimulation.\nOur data suggest PPARbeta pharmacological activation as a novel approach to increase cardiac vascularization and cardiac muscle mass.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2009-04-09", "authors": ["NicoleWagner", "ChantalJehl-Pi\u00e9tri", "PascalLopez", "JosephMurdaca", "ChristianGiordano", "ChantalSchwartz", "PierreGounon", "St\u00e9phane NHatem", "PaulGrimaldi", "Kay-DietrichWagner"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvp106"}

{"title": "Recent advances in imaging of brain tumors.", "abstract": "The recent advances in brain tumor imaging offer unique anatomical as well as pathophysiological information that provides new insights on brain tumors, directed at facilitating therapeutic decisions and providing information regarding prognosis. This information is presently utilized in clinical practice for initial diagnosis and noninvasive, preoperative grading of tumors, biopsy planning, surgery, and radiation portal planning, as well as, prognostication. The newer advances described in this review include magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography, perfusion imaging, MR spectroscopy, and functional imaging, using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) technique. Diffusion tensor MR imaging is the only noninvasive in vivo method for mapping white matter fiber tract trajectories in the human brain. In the current clinical practice, one of the most important indications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is to study the relation of a tumor to the adjacent white matter tracts. Perfusion imaging with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an exciting new radiological technique for noninvasive evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics, in certain definite clinical settings. Cerebral perfusion imaging describes the passage of blood through the brain's vascular network. Perfusion imaging, especially with MRI has become an integral component of the complete radiological assessment of brain tumors. MR Spectroscopy (MSR) is the only noninvasive technique capable of measuring chemicals within the body. MRS distinguishes various metabolites on the basis of their slightly different chemical shifts or resonance frequencies. Functional MRI refers to the demonstration of brain function with neuroanatomic localization on a real-time basis. In patient care, functional MR imaging is primarily used in the preoperative evaluation of the relationship of a brain tumor with an eloquent cortex.

{"title": "[Drugs renal toxicity].", "abstract": "Drug-induced renal dysfunction is frequent in clinical practice. Outcomes may be severe, with increased morbidity and mortality. Kidneys are particularly vulnerable to drug toxicity, especially since they are highly vascularized, thus receiving about 25% of cardiac output. Furthermore, interstitial accumulation of toxic agents in papilla and the medulla often occurs due to the existence of a corticomedullary osmotic gradient. Moreover, the key role played by the renal tubule in the reabsorption processes of a number of endogenous and exogenous substances further increases the exposure of the kidney to high concentrations of potentially toxic agents, both in the tubular lumen and cells. As a result, drugs may be toxic to all of the four structures of the kidney: glomerulus, tubule, interstitium, and blood vessels. This chapter reviews the main mechanisms of drug-induced renal toxicity and then focuses on the nephrotoxicity of anti-infectious drugs: antibacterial drugs, antifungal agents, antimalariae, and antiviral drugs. NSAID and anticancer drugs renal toxicity are detailed elsewhere in this textbook. Methods used to prevent drug-induced nephrotoxicity, when known, are detailed.

{"title": "How not to study spontaneous activity.", "abstract": "Brains are restless. We have long known of the existence of a great deal of uninterrupted brain activity that maintains the body in a stable state--from an evolutionary standpoint one of the brain's most ancient tasks. But intrinsic, ongoing activity is not limited to subcortical, life-maintaining structures; cortex, too, is remarkably active even in the absence of a sensory stimulus or a specific behavioral task. This is evident both in its enormous energy consumption at rest and in the large, spontaneous but coherent fluctuations of neural activity that spread across different areas. Not surprisingly, a growing number of electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are appearing that report on various aspects of the brain's spontaneous activity or \"default mode\" of operation. One recent study reports results from simultaneously combined electrophysiological and fMRI measurements in the monkey visual cortex (Shmuel, A., Leopold, D.A., 2008. Neuronal correlates of spontaneous fluctuations in fMRI signals in monkey visual cortex: implications for functional connectivity at rest. Hum. Brain Mapp. 29, 751-761). The authors claim to be able to demonstrate correlations between slow fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying, locally measured neuronal activity. They even go on to speculate that the fluctuations display wave-like spatiotemporal patterns across cortex. In the present report, however, we re-analyze the data presented in that study and demonstrate that the measurements were not actually taken during rest. Visual cortex was subject to almost imperceptible but physiologically clearly detectable flicker induced by the visual stimulator. An examination of the power spectral density of the neural responses and the neurovascular impulse response function shows that such imperceptible flicker strongly suppresses the slow oscillations and changes the degree of covariance between neural and vascular signals. In addition, a careful analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns demonstrates that no slow waves of activity exist in visual cortex; instead, the presented wave data reflect differences in signal-to-noise ratio at various cortical sites due to local differences in vascularization. In this report, assuming that the term \"spontaneous activity\" refers to intrinsic physiological processes at the absence of sensory inputs or motor outputs, we discuss the need for careful selection of experimental protocols and of examining the degree to which the activation of sensory areas might influence the cortical or subcortical processes in other brain regions.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2009-04-07", "authors": ["Nikos KLogothetis", "YusukeMurayama", "MarkAugath", "TheodorSteffen", "JoachimWerner", "AxelOeltermann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.01.010"}

Finally, in vivo studies were carried out to confirm the osteoinductivity of the developed coating. Results show good material properties for cell adhesion and proliferation. Presented data show cellular differentiation to the osteoblastic phenotype due to rhBMP-2, with a 90% common transcriptional response between the control rhBMP-2 treatment and the developed chitosan/rhBMP-2 film. The growing surface also had an influence on the observed cellular response and was quantified as 7% of the total. These results indicate that both the growth factor and the material induce a cell response, but this is mainly driven by the osteoinductor factor. In vivo, new bone formation and early vascularization was observed around chitosan/rhBMP-2 coated titanium pieces implanted in mouse muscle.

To report a case of deformity secondary to cervical vertebral osteoradionecrosis (ORN) associated with severe wound complications and review the pertinent medical literature. The incidence of deformity after ORN is rare and its association with extensive damage of soft tissues makes surgical treatment difficult. The spine surgeon should be aware of this to adapt the evaluation and surgery and be prepared to manage the numerous potential complications. A case of post-irradiation symptomatic kyphosis involving ORN of C5-C6 is reported. Failure of the anterior approach surgery was observed, and the secondary course was marked by the development of substantial cutaneous necrosis associated with severe and extensive post-irradiation cutaneous and muscular atrophy. Failure of the anterior approach surgery justified the use of posterior stabilization. Secondary destabilization of the posterior fixation at the cervico-thoracic junction required extension of the osteosynthesis to the middle thoracic region. Extensive posterior stabilization permitted obtaining reliable mechanical control of the radio-induced kyphosis with a 3-year follow-up. Wound freshening and covering with well-vascularized tissue was used to fill dead spaces and helped prevent soft-tissue complications after revision surgery. Radio-induced kyphotic deformity is an important entity. Surgeons should be aware of the complications that can lead to further deformity.

Up to 75% of VHL patients are affected by VHL-associated pancreatic lesions; however, very few reports in the published literature have described the cellular origins and biological roles of VHL in the pancreas. Since homozygous loss of Vhl in mice resulted in embryonic lethality, this study aimed to characterize the functional significance of VHL in the pancreas by conditionally inactivating Vhl utilizing the Cre/LoxP system. Specifically, Vhl was inactivated in different pancreatic cell populations distinguished by their roles during embryonic organ development and their endocrine lineage commitment. With Cre recombinase expression directed by a glucagon promoter in alpha-cells or an insulin promoter in beta-cells, we showed that deletion of Vhl is dispensable for normal functions of the endocrine pancreas. In addition, deficiency of VHL protein (pVHL) in terminally differentiated alpha-cells or beta-cells is insufficient to induce pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorigenesis. Most significantly, we presented the first mouse model of VHL-associated pancreatic disease in mice lacking pVHL utilizing Pdx1-Cre transgenic mice to inactivate Vhl in pancreatic progenitor cells. The highly vascularized microcystic adenomas and hyperplastic islets that developed in Pdx1-Cre;Vhl f/f homozygous mice exhibited clinical features similar to VHL patients. Establishment of three different, cell-specific Vhl knockouts in the pancreas have allowed us to provide evidence suggesting that VHL is functionally important for postnatal ductal and exocrine pancreas, and that VHL-associated pancreatic lesions are likely to originate from progenitor cells, not mature endocrine cells.

These disorders are often associated with aberrant angiogenesis, but whether vascular abnormalities during fibrosis are characterized by excessive or diminished neo-vascularization remains questionable. Strikingly, activation of the coagulation cascade is frequently observed in association with the progression of fibroproliferative disorders. As we recently showed that coagulation factor (F)Xa induced fibrotic responses in fibroblasts, we hypothesized that FXa might indirectly induce angiogenesis by triggering fibroblasts to secrete proangiogenic factors. In the present study, we show that although FXa induces p42/44 MAP Kinase phosphorylation in endothelial cells, it has no direct effect on endothelial cell proliferation, protein synthesis and tube formation. In contrast, conditioned medium of fibroblasts stimulated with FXa enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, extra cellular matrix synthesis, wound healing and endothelial tube formation. FXa induced VEGF production by fibroblasts and a VEGF neutralizing antibody blocked the indirect effect of FXa on proliferation and realignment of endothelial cells identifying VEGF as a crucial player in angiogenesis during coagulation factor-induced fibrosis.

Vascular morphology, morphometry and permeability studies were performed in induced rat gliomas. Tumours were identified by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology. Blood brain barrier integrity was examined by EBA and GluT-1 immunostaining and correlated with vascular permeability for gadolinium and intravital dyes. VEGF165 immunoexpression was also analyzed. Tumours were grouped in microtumours (6.69+/-0.99 mm3) displaying a homogeneous T2-w hyperintense signal corresponding to low-grade gliomas, and macrotumours (900.79+/-332.39 mm3) showing gadolinium contrast enhancement, intravital dye extravasation and histopathological features of high-grade gliomas. Results show that the microvascular network becomes aberrant as we move from micro to macrotumours. Vessel density decreases, whereas the relative area occupied by the vascular network increases. Microtumours display homogeneous angioarchitecture composed of simple and mildly dilated vessels similar to normal tissue. Macrotumours show different patterns, following a gradient from the neoangiogenic border to the hypoxic core. The tumour core contains scarce, huge, dilated vessels with some profiles co-expressing GluT-1 and VEGF165, the peripheral tissue shows light dilated vessels co-expressing EBA and GluT-1, and the border area displays glomeruloid vessels strongly positive for VEGF. Glucose uptake was maintained for some vascular endothelial sections in areas where BBB function was lost.

Bones regenerated using recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins, demineralized bone powder, or combinations of these are generally small and do not meet the need. The current trend is to use tissue engineering approaches with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to generate bones of a desired size and shape. A suspension of osteogenically induced MSCs (CD11a-, CD29+, CD44+) was added to 2% alginate, gelled by mixing this combination with calcium sulfate (CaSO(4) 0.2 g/mL), and injected into the subcutaneous pocket in the dorsal aspect of nude mice. Cells of various concentrations (0, 10, 50, and 70 million/mL) were used. These implanted constructs were harvested at predetermined times up to 30 weeks for histology. The doubling time of bovine MSCs is 3.75 +/- 1.96 days and the proliferation is rapid. Histological evaluation revealed signs of endochondrosis with woven bone deposition. The equilibrium modulus increased with time in vivo, though less than that of normal tissue. Implants seeded with 70 million cells/mL for 6 months resulted in the best formation of equilibrium modulus. This approach has several advantages: (i) obtaining MSCs is associated with low donor morbidity; (ii) MSCs proliferate rapidly in vitro, and a large number of viable cells can be obtained; and (iii) the MSC/alginate constructs can develop into bone-like nodules with high cell viability. Such a system may be useful in large-scale production of bony implants or in the repair of bony defects. The fact that endochondral bone formation led to woven bone suggests its potential feasibility in regional cell therapy.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2009-04-02", "authors": ["Sophia Chia-NingChang", "Ching-LungTai", "Hui-YingChung", "Tsung-MinLin", "Long-BinJeng"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1525-1594.2009.00728.x"}

Although randomized phase III clinical trials with anti-angiogenic molecules are not yet available for GBM patients, this treatment regimen is already applied off protocol in several clinical centers. It should be kept in mind though that tumours can develop escape mechanisms.

Disc aggrecan inhibits endothelial cell migration, suggesting an antiangiogenic role. A possible interplay between these factors is unknown.\nThe influence of the respective predominant load (cyclic strain for anulus fibrosus and hydrostatic pressure for nucleus pulposus cells) on PTN and aggrecan expression by IVD cells was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting (PTN only). The effects of IVD cell conditioned medium on endothelial cell migration were analyzed in a bioassay using human microvascular endothelial (HMEC-1) cells.\nApplication of both mechanical loads resulted in significant alterations of gene expression of PTN (+67%, P = 0.004 in anulus cells; +29%, P = 0.03 in nucleus cells) and aggrecan (+42%, P = 0.03 in anulus cells, -25%, P = 0.03 in nucleus cells). These effects depended on the cell type, the applied load, and timescale. Conditioned media of nucleus pulposus cells enhanced HMEC-1 migration, but this effect was diminished after 2.5 MPa hydrostatic pressure, when aggrecan expression was diminished, but not 0.25 MPa, when expression levels were unchanged.\nMechanical loading influences PTN expression by human IVD cells.

The aim of this study was to induce tolerance in a preclinical large animal model. Donor hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment was induced by T-cell depletion, irradiation, and a short course of cyclosporine administered to the recipient, along with a hematopoietic cell infusion from a single haplotype major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatched donor. Skin was then allotransplanted from the donor. Both primarily vascularized skin flaps and secondarily vascularized conventional skin grafts were allotransplanted to investigate if the mode of transplantation affected outcome. Control animals received the skin allotransplants without conditioning. Tolerance was defined as no evidence of rejection at 90 days following transplantation. Conventional skin grafts only achieved prolonged survival (<65 days) in HSC-engrafted animals (P < .01). In contrast, there was indefinite skin flap survival with the achievement of tolerance in HSC-engrafted animals; this was confirmed on histology with donor-specific unresponsiveness on MLR and CML. Furthermore, a conventional skin donor graft subsequently applied to an animal tolerant to a skin flap was not rejected and did not trigger skin flap rejection.

Besides not applying watertight closure of the duraplasty, the inviability and the poor vascularization of the graft and/or the dura (eg, reoperations, multiple operations, or cranial radiotherapy) may lead to delayed healing of the suture site and resultant persistent CSF leaks. We present a simple technique that uses on-site muscle flap with pedicle to supply and vascularize the autologous fascia lata, preserving the viability of the graft and reenforcing its healing ability.\nWe applied this technique in 6 patients with postoperative CSF leaks. After harvesting a fascia lata graft with appropriate size from the patients, the graft was sutured to dural defect in watertight fashion. The suboccipital, temporal, and temporal muscles in 4 patients who had posterior fossa duraplasty, in 1 patient who had pterional craniotomy, and in 1 patient who had subtemporal craniotomy, respectively, were dissected, stretched, and sutured to the fascia graft covering the dura graft suture site and then reinforced by Tisseel fibrin glue (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL). Postoperatively, CSF lumbar drain was kept open for 72 hours with pressure wound dressing. The technical nuances are illustrated.\nCerebrospinal fluid leaks were controlled successfully in 5 patients without recurrence. One patient with posterior fossa duraplasty had recurrence of CSF leak that required reexploration 21 days after the first surgery and a second dural repair in a site distant from the fascia lata attachment. During reexploration intraoperatively, the fascia lata graft was inspected and studied, which has shown the healing of the dura graft site and the graft neovascularization.\nDuraplasty using autologous fascia lata reenforced by on-site pedicled muscle flap is an effective technique to control CSF leak, especially when dura is poorly vascularized and less viable.

The vascularization pattern of vascularized skin allografts (VSA) and nonvascularized skin allografts (NVSA) differs significantly and these differences may alter host immune responses. We hypothesized that vascularized grafts contribute to better engraftment and long-term survival. We have tested our hypothesis by transplantation of different sizes (2 x 2 cm, 4 x 4 cm, 6 x 6 cm) of VSA and NVSA across major histocompatibility complex barrier between LBN (RT1(1+n)) and Lewis (RT1(1)) rats. Correlation of revascularization process with development of donor-specific chimerism was tested. We found that the highest chimerism levels (8%-12.2% in VSA groups; 2.53%-3.92% in NVSA groups) were reached as early as 7 days in both VSA and NVSA. Chimerism decreased in both groups during 100-day follow-up and higher chimerism was found only in VSA in late posttransplant period. Revascularization, assessed by the presence of CD31 positive vessels, was significantly higher in VSA compared with NVSA and to controls (P < 0.05). A direct correlation was seen between increased skin diameter and donor chimerism in VSA, whereas inverse correlation was tested in NVSA.

{"title": "The heel: anatomy, blood supply, and the pathophysiology of pressure ulcers.", "abstract": "There remains much confusion regarding the pathophysiology of pressure ulcers. Data indicate that the prevalence of pressure ulcers is increasing. The heel is unique in structure and well adapted to the task of shock absorption. However, it is often subject to prolonged pressure, which predisposes it to tissue breakdown, with attempts at reconstruction prone to failure. Four dissections were carried out of the heel region, which included removing each heel pad en bloc for histology. Seventeen arterial injection studies, 12 venous studies, and a combined arterial and venous study of the foot were performed. The results were correlated with clinical cases and previous research. The heel was found to be richly vascularized by a subdermal plexus and periosteal plexus with vessels traveling between the 2 within fibrous septa that connect the reticular dermis and periosteum of the calcaneus. These septa effectively create isolated compartments containing relatively avascular fat. A layer of panniculus carnosus muscle was observed in the subcutaneous tissue. It is likely that the metabolically active panniculus carnosus muscle is involved early in the course of pressure ulcers. Extensive pressure damage can be concealed by intact skin.

The goal of this study is to clear the mechanism of antiangiogenic signaling of FHL-2 in endothelial cells (ECs).\nOverexpressed FHL-2 strongly inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced EC migration. In the angiogenic signaling, we focused on sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1), which produces sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid, as a potent angiogenic mediator in ECs. Immunoprecipitation and immunostaining analysis showed that FHL-2 might bind to SK1. Importantly, overexpression of FHL-2 in ECs inhibited VEGF-induced SK1 activity, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. In contrast, overexpression of FHL-2 had no effect on S1P-induced Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, VEGF stimulation decreased the binding of FHL-2 and SK1. Depletion of FHL-2 by siRNA increased EC migration accompanied with SK1 and Akt activation, and increased the expression of VEGF receptor-2 which further enhanced VEGF signaling. Furthermore, injection of FHL-2 mRNA into Xenopus embryos resulted in inhibition of vascular network development, assessed by in situ hybridization with endothelial markers.\nFHL-2 may regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt via direct suppression of the SK1-S1P pathway in ECs.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2009-03-28", "authors": ["HirokiHayashi", "HironoriNakagami", "YoichiTakami", "HiroshiKoriyama", "MasakiMori", "KatsutoTamai", "JianxinSun", "KaoriNagao", "RyuichiMorishita", "YasufumiKaneda"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.178541"}
{"title": "Signaling by hypoxia-inducible factors is critical for ovulation in mice.", "abstract": "The steroid hormone progesterone, acting via its nuclear receptor, is a major regulator of the process of ovulation. Female mice lacking progesterone receptor (PGR) exhibit an anovulatory phenotype due to failure in follicular rupture. To identify the PGR-regulated pathways that control ovulation, we analyzed global changes in gene expression in the ovaries of wild-type and Pgr-null mice subjected to gonadotropin-induced superovulation. Our analysis uncovered several genes whose expression was reduced in the Pgr-null ovaries compared with the wild-type ovaries immediately preceding ovulation. Interestingly, these genes included three hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs): HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and HIF-1 beta. These transcription factors form alphabeta-heterodimers, which regulate the transcription of specific cellular genes, thereby mediating adaptive response of the tissue to low-oxygen levels. We observed that the expression of mRNAs and proteins corresponding to HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and HIF-1 beta was induced in a PGR-dependent manner, specifically in the granulosa cells of the preovulatory follicles. Inhibition of the HIF transcriptional activity by echinomycin, a small-molecule inhibitor that suppresses the binding of HIF alphabeta-heterodimers to target genes, blocked ovulation by preventing the rupture of the preovulatory follicles. Echinomycin specifically inhibited the expression of genes that are known regulators of ovulation, such as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs-1 and endothelin-2. Furthermore, echinomycin reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A, a key factor controlling vascularization/angiogenesis during ovulation.

Retinal levels of VEGF, VEGFR-1, and -2 were evaluated with quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and ELISA.\nIn both WT and sst(1)-KO mice, OIR-induced neovascularization was reduced by octreotide, whereas it was increased by CYN.

{"title": "In vivo observations of cell trafficking in allotransplanted vascularized skin flaps and conventional skin grafts.", "abstract": "The problem of allogeneic skin rejection is a major limitation to more widespread application of clinical composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA). Previous research examining skin rejection has mainly studied rejection of conventional skin grafts (CSG) using standard histological techniques. The aim of this study was to objectively assess if there were differences in the immune response to CSG and primarily vascularized skin in composite tissue allotransplants (SCTT) using in vivo techniques in order to gain new insights in to the immune response to skin allotransplants. CSG and SCTT were transplanted from standard Lewis (LEW) ad Wistar Furth (WF) to recipient transgenic green fluorescent Lewis rats (LEW-GFP). In vivo confocal microscopy was used to observe cell trafficking within skin of the transplants. In addition, immunohistochemical staining was performed on skin biopsies to reveal possible expression of class II major histocompatibility antigens. A difference was observed in the immune response to SCTT compared to CSG. SCTT had a greater density cellular infiltrate than CSG (p<0.03) that was focused more at the center of the transplant (p<0.05) than at the edges, likely due to the immediate vascularization of the skin. Recipient dendritic cells were only observed in rejecting SCTT, not CSG. Furthermore, dermal endothelial class II MHC expression was only observed in allogeneic SCTT. The immune response in both SCTT and CSG was focused on targets in the dermis, with infiltrating cells clustering around hair follicles (CSG and SCTT; p<0.01) and blood vessels (SCTT; p<0.01) in allogeneic transplants. This study suggests that there are significant differences between rejection of SCTT and CSG that may limit the relevance of much of the historical data on skin graft rejection when applied to composite tissue allotransplantation.

{"title": "Multiple receptor subtypes and multiple mechanisms of dilation are involved in vascular network dilation caused by adenosine.", "abstract": "We previously demonstrated a vascular network response initiated by elevated tissue concentrations of adenosine that is distinct from the dilation caused when adenosine is applied directly to the arteriole. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the potential mechanism(s) for the different responses. In the cheek pouch of anesthetized hamster, arteriolar responses were measured when adenosine (10(-4)M) was applied with micropipette into the tissue 500 microm from the arteriole (n=67, baseline diameter 22+/-0.6 microm) or onto the arteriole itself. Application of adenosine to the vessel or into the tissue caused arteriolar dilation with similar concentration profiles. In stark contrast, the concentration profiles were significantly different for vessel and tissue initiated dilation when either sodium nitroprusside or methacholine was tested. Arteriolar dilation was not enhanced when adenosine was simultaneously applied with two pipettes at along a single arteriole; however, the dilation doubled when adenosine was applied simultaneously at arteriole and tissue. Control dilations caused by tissue adenosine (5+/-0.4 microm) were not altered by superfusion of the A(1) receptor antagonist DPCPX (10(-6)M; 4.6+/-0.3 microm), A(2B) receptor antagonist alloxazine (10(-6)M; 6+/-0.8 microm), or A(3) receptor antagonist MRS1220 (5 x 10(-9)M; 6+/-0.8 microm) but were abolished by the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist ZM241385 (10(-7)M; 1+/-0.2 microm), suggesting that activation of A(2A) receptors mediates these network responses. Disruption of arteriolar endothelium and direct arteriolar application of ZM241385 (10(-7)M; 5+/-0.4 microm) did not alter the dilation caused by tissue adenosine. However, local application of ZM241385 into the tissue inhibited adenosine-induced network responses (2+/-0.3 microm).

A sequential approach to their repair is widely accepted, to preserve the vascularization of the neourethra and to avoid injuries in penis covering. In our experience, we believe that all hypospadias, even those associated with penoscrotal transposition, can be repaired in one surgical time by using a vascularized flap from dorsal prepuce in one or two layers (mucosal portion for urethra and skin face for ventral island).\nFrom 1997 until 2007, 88 patients with proximal severe hypospadias have been operated. 35 patients associated penoscrotal transposition. Since 2005, we introduced a modification consisting in drawing the incisions following the own cutaneous folds resulting from the fusion of the lateral folds in penis skin.\nWe performed Duckett type urethroplasty in 10 patients, Onlay type flap in 74, Onlay with oral mucosa in 2 and vesical mucosa urethroplasty in 2 of them. The fistula rate needing surgical closure was 17% (15/88), urethral stenosis was present in 5 patients (5.7%, 1 vesical mucosa, 2 Duckett urethrolpasties and 2 Onlay flaps). Severe complications were represented by partial necrosis of the skin flap in 3 patients (3.4%) needing a reurethroplasty. 1 patient presented surgical wound infection without later problems. Before 2005, among the 22 patients with penoscrotal transposition, 5 needed a new cutaneoplasty, associated in 2 occasions to a dorsal Nesbitt plicature to obtain the complete penis alignment. From 2005 until now, None of the 13 patients presenting with penoscrotal transposition needed any posterior cutaneoplasty. The follow up goes from 1 month until 10 years (median 45 months). At present time, urine spurt shows a correct range in all cases and the penis is located out of scrotal bag except in one patient, waiting for a new plasty.\nIn our experience, we believe that all of the hypospadias may be repaired in a unique surgical time, including those of them associated with buried penis.

We used this experimental model to understand the cause of the defects associated with TD by selecting and identifying the genes differentially expressed in the TD growth plate of broiler chickens.

Furthermore, collagen content had a tendency to decrease in Achilles tendons under thrombocytopenia when compared with placebo treatment at 7 days posttrauma. This was correlated with a decline in maximal stress sustained by tendons at day 14 but not after 28 days. The impact of thrombocytopenia was otherwise negligible, as force relaxation and stiffness were similar in the two groups.

{"title": "The role of selective angiographic embolization of the musculo-skeletal system in haemophilia.", "abstract": "The incidence of haemarthrosis as a result of a spontaneous periarticular aneurysm in haemophilia is very low. In these circumstances, angiographic embolization might be considered as a promising therapeutic and coagulation factor saving option in joint bleeds not responding to replacement of coagulation factor to normal levels. Moreover, embolization should be considered as a possible treatment for postoperative pseudoaneurysms complicating total knee arthroplasty in haemophilia. However, the pathological process of aneurysmal bleeding and clotting factor replacement is entirely different. While embolization is the treatment of choice for some periarticular complications that may occur, it is by no means a panacea for all resistant periarticular bleeds in haemophilia or for postoperative bleeding which usually settles with clotting factor replacement. Another use of arterial embolization is for the treatment of haemophilic tumours of the pelvis, because they can act as a focus for infection and cause cutaneous fistulas. When they present perforations and infections of endogenous origin, their course is usually fatal. Suitable treatment has been investigated on numerous occasions, most of the literature agreeing that the only curative treatment is surgical resection. However, surgical resection after performing arterial embolization to reduce the vascularization of the pseudotumour is a good alternative, thereby reducing the size of the pseudotumour and the risk of bleeding complications during surgery. It is important to bear in mind that despite its efficacy, arterial embolization is an invasive procedure with a reported rate of complications up to 25% (16% minor, 7% serious, 2% death).", "journal": "Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia", "date": "2009-03-27", "authors": ["E CRodriguez-Merchan", "VJimenez-Yuste"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2516.2009.02015.x"}

The authors discuss the course of persistent infection following frontal sinus fractures and propose a novel treatment that definitively obliterates and separates the nasofrontal outflow tract from the cranium in these patients.\nSeven consecutive patients with persistent indolent infections associated with frontal sinus fractures were identified and treated at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center and The Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2005 to 2008.\nThere were three women and four men, with an average age of 41 years. Injury resulted from motor vehicle crashes (n = 4), motorcycle crash (n = 1), fall (n = 1), and other accident (n = 1). All patients were previously treated with conventional techniques (average, 3.6 procedures and 11 years from initial injury) and prolonged antibiotic therapy without resolution of symptoms.

All flaps survived and resulted in complete sinonasal separation and eradication of infection.

{"title": "Increased expression of metastasis-related genes in hypoxic cells sorted from cervical and lymph nodal xenograft tumors.", "abstract": "Solid tumors contain regions of poor oxygenation that relate to the abnormal vascular network. Clinical investigations in cervical carcinoma have shown that positive lymph node status in patients with cervical carcinoma correlates with hypoxia. Earlier, in an orthotopic cervical cancer model, we had shown that exposure to acute hypoxia enhances lymph node metastasis. This study describes a technique for sorting hypoxic cells directly from the cervical xenograft model and reports the expression of 'metastasis-related' genes in hypoxic cells from xenografted cervix and lymph node tumors. Tumor cells were sorted on the basis of DsRed fluorescence and the sub-population of hypoxic cells was sorted on the basis of carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA-9) expression. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted to measure changes in gene expression in the hypoxic cells sorted from primary cervix tumors and lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemistry was used to track changes in protein expression in sections of the same tumors. Metastasis-related genes, CXCR4, uPAR, VEGFC, Hdm2, and OPN, were observed to be upregulated at gene and protein levels in the primary tumors and nodal metastasis from the orthotopic transplants. In particular, the hypoxic cells sorted from orthotopically transplanted cervix tumors and their lymph node metastases from mice exposed to cyclic (intermittent) hypoxia showed higher levels of expression of these genes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these genes may be involved in regulating lymph node metastasis in cervical cancers under hypoxic conditions and provide support to the concept cyclic hypoxia that plays an important role in this process. Our methodological study emphasizes the technique of cell sorting to identify hypoxic cells using CA-9, which may aid in improving prognostic capabilities and in designing rational therapeutic strategies by focusing on hypoxia-specific gene expression profiles of patients.

{"title": "Therapeutic potential of plasma membrane-derived microparticles.", "abstract": "In the past, plasma membrane-derived microparticles were considered \"cellular dust.\" According to the literature, circulating levels of microparticles are increased in several cardiovascular diseases associated with inflammation, suggesting that microparticles are linked to deleterious effects such as endothelial dysfunction or thrombosis. However, very recent studies have shown that under several conditions microparticles can transfer biological messages between cells. Indeed, microparticles act as vectors of key information to maintain cell homeostasis or to favor cell repair and induce angiogenesis. For instance, microparticles of platelet origin are able to repair myocardial injury after myocardial infarction. Also, we have shown that engineered microparticles generated from human activated/apoptotic T cells promote angiogenesis through the up-regulation of adhesion proteins and pro-angiogenic factors in human endothelial cells. Interestingly, the effects induced by these microparticles on the formation of capillary-like structures, expression of adhesion molecules, and pro-angiogenic factors are reversed after silencing of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) morphogen pathway. In addition, the same type of microparticles is able to induce neo-vascularization in an ischemic hindlimb model. These effects are, at least in part, mediated by Shh and nitric oxide production.

By means of conditional transgenesis, we restricted HuR's mutation in either embryonic or endothelial compartments to demonstrate that embryonic lethality is consequent to defects in extraembryonic placenta. HuR's absence impaired the invagination of allantoic capillaries into the chorionic trophoblast layer and the differentiation of syncytiotrophoblast cells that control the morphogenesis and vascularization of the placental labyrinth and fetal support. HuR-null embryos rescued from these placental defects proceeded to subsequent developmental stages but displayed defects in skeletal ossification, fusions in limb elements, and asplenia. By coupling gene expression measurements, data meta-analysis, and HuR-RNA association assays, we identified transcription and growth factor mRNAs controlled by HuR, primarily at the posttranscriptional level, to guide morphogenesis, specification, and patterning.

{"title": "The role of ultrasound in assessment of male fertility.", "abstract": "Ultrasonography (US) is a widely used and well tolerated imaging modality for evaluation of pathologic conditions of the testes. Recent technical advances of US applications and post processing developments have enabled new aspects in the structural and functional analysis of testicular tissue and therefore male fertility. This review covers the most relevant approaches due to recent technical advances. Testicular volume measured by B-mode US correlated significantly with testicular function. Increased resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of capsular branches of testicular arteries on unenhanced color Doppler US examination may be an indicator of impaired testicular microcirculation in patients with clinical varicocele. FSH was inversely correlated with testicular volume and directly correlated with testicular vascularization, suggesting that ultrasonographic and color Doppler scanning of the testes may be used, if a sperm count is not available, to indirectly assess the gonadal function. Perfusion mapping, performed with the use of color Doppler ultrasound, has shown for the first time that in patients suffering from azoospermia, sperm quality and quantity depend on tissue perfusion within the testicle. Testicular arterial blood flow was found to be significantly decreased in men with varicocele. This may be a reflection of the impaired microcirculation. Following decreased testicular arterial blood flow, impaired spermatogenesis may result from defective energy metabolism in the microcirculatory bed. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging is potentially applicable to the investigation of vascular disorders of the testis. Pulse inversion (PI) US data can correctly determine relative testicular perfusion based on nonlinear curve fitting of the US backscatter intensity as a function of time and spectral analysis of the intensity time trace. PI imaging, compared with conventional Doppler US methods, provides superior assessment of perfusion in the setting of acute testicular ischemia. New contrast-enhanced US techniques like microvessel imaging (proposed by Philips) and CPS (proposed by Siemens-Acuson) allow for a better determination of tissue perfusion based on time intensity curves and an illustration of vessel distribution inside the testis. First results show a lower vessel density in atrophic testes and a difference in contrast dynamics in testes with impaired function. Real-time elastography, a method for illustration of tissue stiffness under real-time conditions, demonstrates different elasticity values dependent on testicular volume and function. Further studies will prove if these techniques can evolve into clinical practice.", "journal": "European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology", "date": "2009-03-24", "authors": ["MatthiasSchurich", "FriedrichAigner", "FerdinandFrauscher", "LeoPallwein"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejogrb.2009.02.034"}

Implantation of sponge matrices has been adopted as a model for the accurate quantification of angiogenic and fibrogenic responses as they may occur during wound healing in vivo. Such implants are particularly useful because they offer scope for modulating the environment within which angiogenesis occurs. A sponge implantation model has been optimised and adapted to characterise essential components and their roles in blood vessel formation in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. As a direct consequence of advances in genetic manipulation, mouse models (i.e., knockouts, severe combined immunodeficient [SCID], nude) have provided resources to delineate the mechanisms regulating the healing associated with implants.

The average particle transport speed (PTS) in the oviduct (mean, 133 microm/sec) does not differ in the cycle (metestrus) and during pregnancy after implantation, but it is locally modulated at the site of the embryo. Using videomicroscopy, we were able to document that after entering the ampulla, the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) is not transported by ciliary beating down the oviduct, but firmly attaches to the ampullar epithelium. This attachment is mediated by the cumulus cells. However, when a COC is degenerated, it is floating in the oviductal lumen. As soon as a vital COC is in the ampulla, the sperm bound in the sperm reservoir of the ampullar isthmic junction leave the reservoir and hurry to the oocyte. When a sperm has penetrated the zona pellucida, the COC detaches and continues its migration. Quantitative measurements showed that the early embryo is able to locally downregulate PTS during its migration down the oviduct. It locally changes the pattern of vascularization and induces the formation of secretory cells. Our studies imply that the oviductal epithelium is able to select vital oocytes. The early embryo is able to induce the formation of secretory cells, modify vascularization, and downregulate speed of transport, thus creating the prerequisite for the first embryo-maternal communication in the oviduct.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2009-03-21", "authors": ["SabineK\u00f6lle", "SabineDubielzig", "SvenReese", "AxelWehrend", "PeterK\u00f6nig", "WolfgangKummer"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.108.073874"}

Three-quarters of the fibers are of the special visceral efferent group (SVE). Central connections of the facial motonucleus are numerous, particularly with the trigeminal complex but also the cochlear nerves. Only endoneurium surrounds facial nerve fibers in the cerebellopontine angle; central nervous system tissue offers a small extracellular space, lacking collagen and funicular plexus, without epiperineurium: nerve fibers are therefore more susceptible to injury. The segment of a nerve that reveals both CNS and PNS components is referred to as the transition zone. It should be regarded as a \"locus minor resistae\" because of poor vascularization and CNS myelin deficiency. The acousticofacial reflex is often absent in patients with hemifacial spasm.

Biopsy specimens from 30 patients with BPS/IC and glomerulations, and 10 control patients, were examined immunohistochemically for VEGF expression, microvessel density (MVD) and immature microvessels. Pericyte coverage of microvessels in the specimens was used as an indicator of mature microvessels, and pericytes were identified by double-immunohistochemistry for CD34 and alpha-smooth muscle actin. The microvessel pericyte coverage index (MPI) was calculated as the ratio of mature vessels to total vessels. We also assessed the relationship between these angiogenic profiles and associated clinical features including pain and glomerulations.\nVEGF expression in the lamina propria was significantly higher in BPS/IC than in control samples (50% vs 10%, P < 0.05).

We have previously reported a recombinant Clostridium perfringens (Cp) strain constructed by deletion of the superoxide dismutase (sod) gene and insertion of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, Cp/sod(-)/PVL, which showed elevated oxygen sensitivity, tumor selectivity, and oncopathic potency in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer in immune-competent and syngeneic mice, and that led to substantial prolongation of animal survival. A major limitation to Cp/sod(-)/PVL in clinical applications is that it expresses phospholipase C (plc), the alpha-toxin and the major virulence determinant in Cp that is causative in the development of gas gangrene. In this study, the plc gene in Cp/sod(-)/PVL was knocked out to create Cp/plc(-)/sod(-)/PVL, which was shown to be incapable of inducing gas gangrene in mice. Intravenous injection of Cp/plc(-)/sod(-)/PVL spores led to a significant survival advantage in tumor-bearing mice with the same efficacy as Cp/sod(-)/PVL, indicating that the oncopathic potency of Cp is independent of a functional plc gene. The treatment also did not lead to an attenuated immune response to a subsequent pathogen challenge, indicating that a systemic immune-suppressive effect in the host is absent. Consequently, Cp/plc(-)/sod(-)/PVL is a novel oncopathic bacterial agent for the effective treatment of pancreatic cancer and other poorly vascularized tumors, with a substantially enhanced safety profile, which is essential for the development of translational studies in the future.", "journal": "Human gene therapy", "date": "2009-03-21", "authors": ["ZhiyuLi", "JohnFallon", "JohnMandeli", "JamesWetmur", "Savio L CWoo"], "doi": "10.1089/hum.2008.145"}

In this report, two cases of oral cavity reconstruction with DIEP free flaps are described. In both cases, the defect was reconstructed with a DIEP free flap because it could avoid functional damage to the donor site. Successful reconstruction with a two skin-island method was performed in both patients. Furthermore, donor site morbidity was minimal in both patients. When a DIEP free flap is used for head and neck reconstruction, elimination of dead space is the most difficult problem, because a DIEP free flap does not contain well-vascularized muscle tissue.

{"title": "Nicotine: a pro-angiogenic factor.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is regulated by the balance between angiogenic activating and inhibiting factors. Recent evidence indicates that nicotine, an alkaloid compound, presents pro-angiogenic effects in certain concentrations. Nicotine-induced angiogenesis results from the stimulation of non-neuronal nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (particularly alpha 7-NAChR subtype) and involves growth factor secretion and activation of intracellular signalling pathways. Although nicotine is a constituent of tobacco smoke, its contribution towards pathophysiology of several tobacco-associated pathologies is controversial. Nowadays, nicotine is used in tobacco smoke cessation programs, but, again, its use is still a matter of discordance regarding cardiovascular morbidity. Nevertheless, given the established effects of nicotine-induced angiogenesis, this alkaloid might be of therapeutic value in situations of inefficient angiogenesis, such as peripheral vascular impairment and tissue ischemia. Conversely, blockade of nicotine pathway can be helpful in complications exhibiting excessive angiogenesis, namely in diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy or neoplasia. Knowing that nicotine is involved in many angiogenic-associated disorders with a high prevalence in the western world, and that this alkaloid widely used in smoke cessation programs, elucidation of the action of nicotine on the vascularization process is of utmost importance.

Tissues consisted of microcarrier beads coated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells embedded in fibrin. The fibrin was covered with a monolayer of normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), or exposed to conditioned media from NHLFs. Capillary networks developed at 20% or 1% O(2) tension for 8 days.

Maximal capillary formation occurred in media conditioned by NHLFs at 20% O(2), supplemented with VEGF (concentration >10 pM). Hypoxia (1% O(2)) did not stimulate basic fibroblast growth factor production and decreased in vitro angiogenesis, despite an increase in endogenous VEGF production.

Drastic phenotypic and biochemical changes occur during the metamorphosis of a normal tissue cell into an invasive cancer cell. These alterations concern various areas such as growth factor signaling, cell-cell adhesion, gene expression, motility or cell shape. Cancer cells of epithelial origin can even shed their typical qualities and characteristics and adopt a mesenchymal-like phenotype. This is often referred to as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Various oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and metastasis suppressor genes are known to affect the invasiveness and the metastatic potential of tumor cells. Cells of the innate and adaptive immunity, adjacent stroma cells as well as chemokines and their receptors also play a vital role in the spread of cancer cells. Furthermore, the micro-environment, vascularization and the supply with special cytokines affect the above-mentioned changes. Finally, some researchers claim that tumors consist of two types of cells - transit amplifying cells and cancer stem cells. Only the latter are thought to be able to proliferate indefinitely and thus they might be the cells that successfully spread and initially build most of the clinically relevant metastases.

The polyurethane scaffolds, i.e., PU-S, PU-M and PU-F, were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of BALB/c mice. Using intravital fluorescence microscopy we analyzed vascularization of the implants and venular leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction in the surrounding host tissue over a 14 day period. Incorporation of the scaffolds was analyzed by histology, and a WST-1 assay was performed to evaluate their cell biocompatibility in vitro. Our results indicate that none of the polyurethane scaffolds was cytotoxic. Accordingly, rolling and adherent leukocytes in venules of the dorsal skinfold chamber were found in a physiological range after scaffold implantation and did not significantly differ between the groups, indicating a good in vivo biocompatibility. However, the three scaffolds induced a weak angiogenic response with a microvessel density of only approximately 47-60 and approximately 3-10cm/cm(2) in the border and centre zones of the scaffolds at day 14 after implantation.

Elastin is necessary to sustain continual pulsatile flow and to prevent the dilatation of vascular tissues. Unfortunately, elastogenesis in tissue-engineered constructs has been very limited. To overcome this limitation, we have created tubular elastin scaffolds from porcine carotid arteries. Elastin would provide the necessary elasticity to the graft on implanting these scaffolds as vascular grafts. In this study, elastin tubes with agarose gel containing either stromal-derived factor-1 alpha [SDF; for homing of endothelial cells (ECs)] or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; for homing of myofibroblasts) were implanted into adipose tissue, as it is a known source of stem/progenitor cells. We also implanted these tubes into subdermal pouches (as a control location). We observed a difference in the types of cells recruited-ECs were recruited in large numbers by SDF in the adipose tissue, whereas the adipose-FGF group had a vascularized (smooth muscle and EC-positive), collagenous capsule (adventitia) with many smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA)-positive cells in the elastin scaffold layer (media). These results were in contrast to the subdermal group, which only recruited fibroblasts and some SMA-positive cells. Also, more cell infiltration and neo-collagen formation was seen in adipose implants.

In the experimental group, this was followed by application of autogenous greater omentum as a free nonvascularized graft around the osteotomy gap.

Histological analysis was performed on the mid-radial diaphysis containing the 4-month-old osteotomy site. Radiological and histological properties of the group treated with free transplant of the greater omentum revealed complete union. In contrast, there was no evidence indicating union in the control group. Analyses of the radiological and histological scores confirmed that osteotomies treated with free transplant of the autogenous greater omentum had united, whereas the osteotomies of the control group failed to unite. Significant differences between the mean values for radiological and histological-grading score in the control and experimental groups were detected (p < 0.05).

Brain metastases frequently are highly vascularized, a process driven primarily by VEGF. VEGF mediates numerous changes within the vasculature including endothelial cell retraction and increased permeability, vasodilation, and new vessel formation. Here we describe a xenograft brain metastasis model that mimics the critical steps of metastasis including tumor cell dissemination and vascular adhesion, tumor growth and tumor associated angiogenesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to evaluate two aspects of the functional response of brain metastasis to the anti-VEGF receptor therapeutic, AZD2171 (Cediranib, RECENTIN). MR tracking of individual cells demonstrated that cediranib did not impede tumor cell extravasation into the brain parenchyma despite evidence that anti-VEGF treatment decreases the permeability of the blood brain barrier. In a second assay, blood volume imaging using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide revealed that treatment of well-developed brain metastasis with cediranib for 7 days led to a heterogeneous response with respect to individual tumors. Overall, there was a significant average decrease in the tumor vascular bed volume. The majority of large tumors demonstrated substantially reduced central blood volumes relative to normal brain while retaining a rim of elevated blood volume at the tumor brain interface. Small tumors or occasional large tumors displayed a static response.

{"title": "Endothelin-1 stimulates lymphatic endothelial cells and lymphatic vessels to grow and invade.", "abstract": "The lymphatic vasculature is essential for tissue fluid homeostasis and cancer metastasis, although the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly characterized. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) axis plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Here, we first report that ET-1 acts as a lymphangiogenic mediator. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies and show that lymphatic endothelial cells produce ET-1, ET-3, and express the endothelin B receptor (ET(B)R). In these cells, ET-1 promotes proliferation, invasiveness, vascular-like structures formation, and phosphorylation of AKT and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase through ET(B)R. In normoxic conditions, ET-1 is also able to up-regulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, VEGF receptor-3, and VEGF-A, and to stimulate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression similarly to hypoxia. Moreover, HIF-1alpha silencing by siRNA desensitizes VEGF-C and VEGF-A production in response to ET-1 or hypoxia, implicating HIF-1alpha/VEGF as downstream signaling molecules of ET-1 axis. Double immunofluorescence analysis of human lymph nodes reveals that lymphatic vessels express ET(B)R together with the lymphatic marker podoplanin. Furthermore, a Matrigel plug assay shows that ET-1 promotes the outgrowth of lymphatic vessels in vivo. ET(B)R blockade with the specific antagonist, BQ788, inhibits in vitro and in vivo ET-1-induced effects, demonstrating that ET-1 through ET(B)R directly regulates lymphatic vessel formation and by interacting with the HIF-1alpha-dependent machinery can amplify the VEGF-mediated lymphatic vascularization.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of erythromycin (EM) on ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) particle-induced VEGF/VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1) gene production and inflammatory osteolysis in a mouse model.\nUHMWPE particles were introduced into established air pouches on BALB/c mice, followed by implantation of calvaria bone from syngeneic littermates. EM treatment started 2 weeks after bone implantation (5 mg/kg day, i.p. injection). Mice without drug treatment as well as mice injected with saline alone were included. Pouch tissues were harvested 2 weeks after bone implantation. Expression of VEGF, Flt-1, RANKL, IL-1, TNF and CD68 was measured by immunostain and RT-PCR, and implanted bone resorption was analyzed by micro-CT (muCT).\nExposure to UHMWPE induced pouch tissue inflammation, increase of VEGF/Flt-1 proteins, and increased bone resorption. EM treatment significantly improved UHMWPE particle-induced tissue inflammation, reduced VEGF/Flt-1 protein expression, and diminished the number of TRAP(+) cells, as well as the implanted bone resorption.\nThis study demonstrated that EM inhibited VEGF and Flt-1 gene expression.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of 3-dimensional demonstration and volumetric assessment of soft tissue vascular lesions both in the treatment of these lesions with curettage and in the participation of the patients to the decision-making process of the disease. Five patients with vascular malformation of the head and neck regions were included to this prospective trial. All patients were evaluated with preoperative angiography, and selective embolizations of the soft tissue vascular lesions were done in the same session by the same interventional radiologists. The amount of embolic agent injected was determined according to the size and vascularization of the lesions. Surgery was done by curettage of the embolized lesions 7 to 10 days after the embolization procedure. The raw data obtained from preoperative and postoperative high-resolution computed tomographic scans of the patients were processed with a Mimics 9.22 Software (Materialise's Interactive Medical Image Control System, Leuven, Belgium). Volume and surface area of the injected embolic agent were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using the software package SPSS 10.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the measurements of the volume and the surface area of injected sclerosing agent preoperatively and postoperatively. There were no complications related to either the preoperative angiography or embolization procedure. All the patients emphasized (assessed) that the 3-dimensional demonstration of the lesions and their relation with other anatomic structures helped them to understand the extent of their pathology and aim of the proposed treatment. The difference between the volumetric measurements before and after the treatment was found statistically significant. Treatment of large soft tissue vascular lesions with curettage after embolization has acceptable cosmetic results. Although it is not possible to remove all of the sclerosing agent from its injection site with this technique, a significant amount of it can be removed, and the 3-dimensional vascular architecture of the lesion is disturbed. Reactive chronic inflammation against the remaining sclerosing agent and the intralesional scarring caused by curettage lead to further improvement.

Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors may slow or even prevent vascular proliferation and subsequent loss of membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patient.

Here, we show that in endothelial cells IL-8 initiates a signaling route that converges with that deployed by VEGF at the level of the small GTPase Rac1 and that both act through the p21-activated kinase to promote the phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin. However, whereas VEGF activates Rac1 through Src-related kinases, IL-8 specifically signals to Rac1 through its cognate G protein-linked receptor, CXCR2, and the stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) catalytic isoform, thereby providing a specific molecular targeted intervention in vascular permeability. These results prompted us to investigate the potential role of IL-8 signaling in a mouse model for retinal vascular hyperpermeability. Importantly, we observed that IL-8 is upregulated upon laser-induced retinal damage, which recapitulates enhanced vascularization, leakage, and inflammatory responses. Moreover, blockade of CXCR2 and PI3Kgamma was able to limit neovascularization and choroidal edema, as well as macrophage infiltration, therefore contributing to reduce retinal damage.

Overexpression of RRM2 significantly enhances the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor. Angiogenesis is critical to tumor malignancy; it plays an essential role in tumor growth and metastasis. It is important to investigate whether the angiogenic potential of tumor is affected by RRM2.\nWe examined the expression of antiangiogenic thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in two RRM2-overexpressing KB cells: KB-M2-D and KB-HURs. We found that TSP-1 was significantly decreased in both KB-M2-D and KB-HURs cells compared to the parental KB and mock transfected KB-V. Simultaneously, RRM2-overexpressing KB cells showed increased production of VEGF mRNA and protein.

In comparison with KB-V, overexpression of RRM2 had no significant effect on proliferation in vitro, but it dramatically accelerated in vivo subcutaneous growth of KB-M2-D. KB-M2-D possessed more angiogenic potential than KB-V, as shown in vitro by its increased chemotaxis for endothelial cells and in vivo by the generation of more vascularized tumor xenografts.\nThese findings suggest a positive role of RRM2 in tumor angiogenesis and growth through regulation of the expression of TSP-1 and VEGF.", "journal": "Molecular cancer", "date": "2009-03-03", "authors": ["KeqiangZhang", "ShuyaHu", "JunWu", "LinlingChen", "JianmingLu", "XiaochenWang", "XiyongLiu", "BingsenZhou", "YunYen"], "doi": "10.1186/1476-4598-8-11\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142443\n10.1159/000057017\n10.1038/35003506\n10.1074/jbc.M106088200\n10.1073/pnas.91.20.9257\n10.1097/00008390-199212000-00014\n10.3816/CCC.2007.n.007\n10.1073/pnas.94.24.13181\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206232\n10.1073/pnas.93.24.14036\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0799\n10.1023/A:1006559901771\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207272\n10.1038/nm0195-27\n10.1038/nm0603-653\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80108-7\n10.1146/annurev.med.54.101601.152418\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9\n10.1083/jcb.200407060\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2218\n10.1016/S0006-2952(98)00042-2\n10.1038/nrc1093\n10.1038/nrc704\n10.1111/j.1365-2184.2004.00319.x\n10.1093/carcin/24.2.199\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00030-8\n10.1073/pnas.171460498\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.177\n10.1038/sj.onc.1200977"}

The nature of ischemia-reperfusion signals are antigen independent, but have been hypothesized to initiate Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin (IL)-1R-mediated signaling pathways that are thought to potentiate alloimmune responses. We wondered whether MyD88, an adaptor molecule critical for both TLR and IL-1R-mediated inflammatory responses, regulated monocyte differentiation in a mouse model of vascularized orthotopic lung transplantation. Orthotopic left lung transplants were performed in the following syngeneic combinations: CD45.1(+) B6 --> CD45.2(+) MyD88(-/-) and CD45.1(+) B6 --> CD45.2(+) B6. One day later, recipient-derived dendritic cells and macrophage numbers were assessed in the bronchiolar lavage by FACS analysis. Compared with the bronchiolar lavage of wildtype recipients, MyD88(-/-) recipients had lower numbers of dendritic cells in lung graft airways that were of recipient origin. Lower numbers of newly differentiated lung graft dendritic cells was coincident with the appearance of higher numbers of undifferentiated monocytes in the lung airways of MyD88(-/-) recipients as compared with wild-type recipients. Moreover, adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that MyD88(-/-) monocytes were poorer at differentiating into lung dendritic cells as compared with wild-type monocytes.

Approximately one third of graft-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells expressed Foxp3. CD4(+) T cells isolated from these grafts induced apoptosis of alloreactive CD8(+) T cells that were stimulated with donor splenocytes in vitro.

Five cases had been treated with primary cobalt radiotherapy laryngeal field only and 4 cases laryngeal field with draining neck nodes, while photon therapy was given in 4 cases as laryngeal field only and 3 cases laryngeal field with draining neck nodes. All cases were squamous cell carcinoma (13 cases grade 2, 2 cases grade 3 and one case grade 1) proved before radiotherapy. Supraglottic recurrence was detected in 7 cases (43.75%) and glottis in 9 cases (56.25%). Following salvage surgery, 11 cases were staged T3 N0, N1 and N2, 3 cases were T2 N0 or N1 and 2 cases were T4 N2 with skin infiltration. Tracheostomy was there in 4 cases.\nThe study included fifteen males (93.75%) and one female (6.25%), age was between 38-73 years (mean=55.5 years). Five cases were operated on as total laryngectomy with excision of skin flaps + PMMC flap, 4 cases as total laryngectomy with skin flap excision + functional block neck dissection + PMMC flap and 7 cases as total laryngectomy + block neck dissection with skin excision (modified radical in 4 cases &radical in 3 cases) + PMMC flap reconstruction. Flaps survived in all cases, PCF developed in 2 cases (12.5%) with wound infection but healed conservatively within 2 weeks. Dropped shoulder occurred in 3 cases (18.75%) treated by physiotherapy. Mild postoperative chest infection developed in 7 cases (36.84%) improved by broad spectrum antibiotics and chest physiotherapy.\nRoutine use of pectoralis major myocutaneous flap in salvage laryngeal surgery is of great help in such high risk patients to minimize incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula and to allow primary skin wound healing. This flap will give the patient the advantage of early oral feeding, good tracheostomy care, short hospital stay and protection against catastrophic vascular blow out mortality.\nPectoralis major myocutaneous flap - Prevention of pharyngocutaneous fistula - Salvage laryngectomy.", "journal": "Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute", "date": "2009-03-01", "authors": ["Ali HMebeed", "Hesham AHussein", "Tarek KhSaber", "Mohamed AZohairy", "MohamedLotayef"], "doi": null}
{"title": "AAV-2-mediated expression of IGF-1 in skeletal myoblasts stimulates angiogenesis and cell survival.", "abstract": "The transplantation of skeletal myoblasts is being tested in various organ systems to facilitate tissue repair and regeneration. Previous studies have indicated that transplanted cells for varied reasons were not surviving in sufficient numbers following transplantation, thus negatively affecting overall therapeutic efficacy of the approach. We hypothesize that the genetic modification of myoblasts to express insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) locally may enhance the survival of transplanted cells by stimulating neo-vascularization, decreasing apoptosis, and promoting cell proliferation. Using an adeno-associated virus (adeno-associated virus type 2) vector system, the IGF-1 gene was introduced into canine skeletal myoblasts. As a negative control, myoblasts transduced with the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was used. Relative angiogenic response induced by IGF-1 myoblast was compared to VEGF165-induced neo-vascularization using Matrigel plugs under similar conditions. In vitro evaluation and characterization revealed that the secreted IGF-1 protein was biologically and functionally active in promoting endothelial cell proliferation, migration and assembly into vessel-like structures. Matrigel plugs containing the three test groups were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice (n = 5). After 3 weeks, analysis of explanted samples revealed an enhanced neo-vascularization with an average microvessel density per field for IGF-1 at 55.9 versus 33.4 for vascular endothelial growth factor and 24 for GFP. Additionally, apoptosis was significantly reduced (p <or= 0.02) and proliferative capacity of implanted cells significantly increased (p <or= 0.01) with the IGF-1-transduced myoblasts. We conclude that the genetic modification of skeletal myoblasts with the IGF-1 gene offers a potential means for enhanced cell survival following transplantation.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2009-03-01", "authors": ["Indira VSubramanian", "Brian C AFernandes", "TimothyRobinson", "JenniferKoening", "Kelly SLapara", "SRamakrishnan"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-008-9063-8"}
{"title": "Pituitary pars intermedia of male viscacha (Lagostomus maximus maximus): a morphometric study of seasonal and age-related changes in immunohistochemistry.", "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the pituitary pars intermedia in seasonally captured adult male and immature viscachas by immunohistochemistry and image analysis. The pituitary pars intermedia exhibited a well-developed parenchyma with scarce connective tissue and vascularization. It was formed by a close association of melanotrophs and folliculostellate cells. The folliculostellate cells were stellate in shape with cytoplasmic processes, and they originated follicles with PAS-positive colloid inside. The morphometric parameters of melanotrophs, follicular colloid and folliculostellate cells (S-100-ir and GFAP-ir) varied seasonally and in relation to age. These parameters showed minimal values in the adult males captured in winter and in immature animals, and they were maximal in summer. The percentage of vimentin-positive area of the folliculostellate cells was maximal in immature animals, decreased in relation to age and did not vary seasonally in the adult animals. The greatest development of pars intermedia in the adult animals in relation to the immature ones is probably related to the adults' adaptation to the semiarid environment. The expression of the tested proteins suggests a probable neuroectodermic origin for the folliculostellate cells of the viscacha pituitary pars intermedia. In addition, the cytoplasmic processes of folliculostellate cells might originate an intercellular communication network inside the pars intermedia. The decrease in the morphometric parameters melanotrophs, follicular colloid and folliculostellate cells in winter suggests a low endocrine activity of this zone. This fact might be due to the effect of the short photoperiod and high melatonin serum levels.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2009-02-28", "authors": ["MarianoAcosta", "FabianMohamed"], "doi": "10.1159/000204751"}
{"title": "Transport-mediated angiogenesis in 3D epithelial coculture.", "abstract": "Increasing interest has focused on capturing the complexity of tissues and organs in vitro as models of human pathophysiological processes. In particular, a need exists for a model that can investigate the interactions in three dimensions (3D) between epithelial tissues and a microvascular network since vascularization is vital for reconstructing functional tissues in vitro. Here, we implement a microfluidic platform to analyze angiogenesis in 3D cultures of rat primary hepatocytes and rat/human microvascular endothelial cells (rMVECs/hMVECs). Liver and vascular cells were cultured on each sidewall of a collagen gel scaffold between two microfluidic channels under static or flow conditions. Morphogenesis of 3D hepatocyte cultures was found to depend on diffusion and convection across the nascent tissue. Furthermore, rMVECs formed 3D capillary-like structures that extended across an intervening gel to the hepatocyte tissues in hepatocyte-rMVEC coculture while they formed 2D sheet-like structures in rMVEC monoculture. In addition, diffusion of fluorescent dextran across the gel scaffold was analyzed, demonstrating that secreted proteins from the hepatocytes and MVECs can be exchanged across the gel scaffold by diffusional transport.

With the two MAbs, we detected the expression pattern of CXCR4 on T lymphocytes and human tumor cell lines by FCM (flow cytometry), as well as glioma tissues by immunohistochemical staining. The results showed widespread CXCR4 expression patterns in tumor cell lines and tissues and an inducible expression in CD4(+) T lymphocytes.

Despite their versatility, few studies have used mouse glioma models with perfusion MRI approaches, and generally lack longitudinal study design. Using a micro-MRI system (8.5 Tesla), a novel dual bolus-tracking perfusion MRI strategy was implemented. Using the small molecule contrast agent Magnevist, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI was implemented in the intracranial 4C8 mouse glioma model to determine K(trans) and v(e), indices of tumor vascular permeability and cellularity, respectively. Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI was subsequently implemented to assess both cerebral blood flow and volume, using the macromolecular superparamagnetic iron oxide, Feridex, which circumvented tumor bolus susceptibility curve distortions from first-pass extravasation. The high-resolution parametric maps obtained over 4 weeks, indicated a progression of tumor vascularization, permeability, and decreased cellularity with tumor growth. In conclusion, a comprehensive array of key parameters were reliably quantified in a longitudinal mouse glioma study.

Angiogenic growth factors are predominantly expressed during the early phases for re-establishment of the vascularity, whereas osteogenic growth factors are continuously expressed during bone formation and remodeling. Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are key regulators of angiogenesis and osteogenesis during bone regeneration, the aim of this study was to investigate if their sequential release could enhance BMP-2-induced bone formation. A composite consisting of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres loaded with BMP-2 embedded in a poly(propylene) scaffold surrounded by a gelatin hydrogel loaded with VEGF was used for the sequential release of the growth factors. Empty composites or composites loaded with VEGF and/or BMP-2 were implanted ectopically and orthotopically in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=9). Following implantation, the local release profiles were determined by measuring the activity of (125)I-labeled growth factors using scintillation probes. After 8 weeks blood vessel and bone formation were analyzed using microangiography, microCT and histology. The scaffolds exhibited a large initial burst release of VEGF within the first 3 days and a sustained release of BMP-2 over the full 56-day implantation period. Although VEGF did not induce bone formation, it did increase the formation of the supportive vascular network (p=0.03) in ectopic implants. In combination with local sustained BMP-2 release, VEGF significantly enhanced ectopic bone formation compared to BMP-2 alone (p=0.008). In the orthotopic defects, no effect of VEGF on vascularisation was found, nor was bone formation higher by the combination of growth factors, compared to BMP-2 alone. This study demonstrates that a sequential angiogenic and osteogenic growth factor release may be beneficial for the enhancement of bone regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2009-02-24", "authors": ["Diederik H RKempen", "LichunLu", "AndrasHeijink", "Theresa EHefferan", "Laura BCreemers", "AvudaiappanMaran", "Michael JYaszemski", "Wouter J ADhert"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.01.031"}
{"title": "Multispectral molecular imaging of capillary endothelium to facilitate preoperative endovascular brain mapping.", "abstract": "Brain mapping aims to localize neurological function to specific regions of the human brain. Preoperative endovascular brain mapping (PEBM) is a novel approach that allows clear visualization of nonfunctional (silent) brain parenchyma in real time during a resection. It has potential to improve neurosurgical guidance because brain shift does not alter the maps, and the map is visualized directly on the brain in situ rather than on a nearby image. Therefore, the risk of a new neurological deficit should be reduced. The authors report the first PEBM approach that combines selective molecular targeting of brain endothelium with multispectral (optical) imaging in preclinical animal models.\nSprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand white rabbits were selectively catheterized, and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-derivatized tomato lectin-based imaging probe was administered into the carotid artery or posterior cerebral artery, measuring < 500 microm in diameter. After binding/uptake of the imaging probe, and removal of unbound probe, a craniotomy was performed to directly visualize the \"brain map.\"\nSelective localization of the imaging probe to the right hemisphere in rats or right posterior cerebral artery in rabbits was clearly visualized after craniotomy. Cross-sections of stained capillaries demonstrated that the imaging probe did not cause vascular occlusion. Gross regional selectivity of the imaging probe was documented by multispectral molecular imaging of intact brains, with discrete localization and endothelium-directed targeting validated by histological examination.\nThe authors have demonstrated the first molecular endothelium-targeted approach to PEBM that does not require manipulation of the intact blood-brain barrier or result in vascular occlusion. Furthermore, the presented multispectral molecular imaging technique appears to be a suitable methodology for the generation of region-selective brain maps of vascularized brain parenchyma. Further refinement of the PEBM approach, as well as the development of improved imaging probes, may result in clinical advancement of PEBM where direct visual discrimination of nonfunctional silent brain parenchyma at the time of resection could significantly improve neurosurgical outcomes.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2009-02-24", "authors": ["H CharlesManning", "Sheila DShay", "Robert AMericle"], "doi": "10.3171/2008.9.JNS08420"}

Its main feature is a local malignancy. In its clinical course it destroys adjoining structures, without metastasizing. It appears rarely, and is mainly found in boys at puberty. Among theories about the aetiology of juvenile angiofibroma, we must consider a haematoma-like lesion, an angioma with an extended fibrous component, or type of inflammatory allergic polyp. In the development of the lesion the participation of hormonal disorders on the pituitary gland-gonad axis is also suggested. According to the latest research, juvenile angiofibroma is regarded as a developmental defect, affecting the embryonic vascular network surrounding the sphenoid bone.\nIf the patient or his/her parents refuse blood transfusion and use of blood products, it is necessary to apply modifications in the routine perioperative treatment. In the case of the patient refusing blood and blood products transfusion because of their beliefs, it is possible to get consent to use different, highly processed products like albumins or a cryoprecipitate, as well as applying some blood-saving techniques.\n1. Removal of juvenile angiofibroma with minimal bleeding is possible. 2. Applying erythropoietin and iron preparations prior to surgery increases erythropoiesis and reduces the risks in transfusion. 3.

In contrast to male thyroid cartilages, the ventral half of the female thyroid cartilage plate remains unmineralized until advanced age. In cartilage specimens from laryngectomies and autopsies, apoptosis was studied immunohistochemically and the oxidative mitochondrial enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) was localized histochemically. In addition, very fresh specimens from laryngectomies were fixed under addition of ruthenium hexamine trichloride or tannin to fixation solution to study cell organelles of chondrocytes by electron microscopic methods. In general, apoptotic chondrocytes decreased in thyroid cartilages of both genders, especially after the second decade. In the age group 41-60 years, thyroid cartilage from male specimens revealed a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells than did thyroid cartilage from women (P = 0.004), whereas in the age groups 0-20 years and 61-79 years no statistically significant gender difference was determined. In general, thyroid cartilage from women contained more living chondrocytes into advanced age than men. Chondrocytes adjacent to mineralized cartilage were partly positive for apoptosis and NADH-TR and partly negative. Apoptotic chondrocytes often were localized in areas of asbestoid fibres where vascularization and mineralization took place first. Electron microscopy revealed remnants of chondrocytes in asbestoid fibres. Taken together, it can be assumed that some chondrocytes in thyroid cartilage die by apoptosis and that these chondrocytes are characterized by absent reactivity for the mitochondrial enzyme NADH-TR.

A triangular skin flap was interpositioned between the developed glanular wings to cover the neourethra. The source of this flap was either the outer preputial skin in eight patients subjected to double onlay preputial flaps and was a skin flap developed from the ventrolateral penile skin in two cases repaired by Snodgrass procedure and another by Mathieu flip flap repair.\nCosmetic appearance was good in all cases except one.

Immunostaining was used to determine osteopontin expression in grafted and recipient bone, and histologic examination was used to assess bone architecture.\nEarly engraftment of donor bone marrow cells (RT1 n) into the recipient bone marrow compartment was achieved at posttransplantation day 7. This corresponded with osteopontin expression restricted to the endosteum of trabecular bone and was associated with the preservation of hematopoietic cells within donor bone. Cell migration between donor and recipient bone marrow compartments was confirmed by the presence of recipient cells (RT1 l) within the allografted bone and donor-origin cells (RT1 n) within the recipient bone. At posttransplantation day 63, osteopontin expression within allografted bone was associated with allograft bone fibrosis and lack of hematopoietic properties. In contrast, the recipient's contralateral bone demonstrated a highly localized osteopontin expression pattern within the endosteum and active hematopoiesis with the presence of donor-specific (RT1 n) cells and correlated with chimerism maintenance.\nThese results confirm that despite up-regulation of osteopontin expression and fibrosis of allografted bone, vascularized bone marrow transplantation resulted in efficient engraftment of donor cells into the recipient's bone marrow compartment, leading to chimerism maintenance.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2009-02-21", "authors": ["AleksandraKlimczak", "SakirUnal", "GalipAgaoglu", "KevinCarnevale", "MariaSiemionow"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e318191be13"}

We tested the hypothesis that intrinsic differences in the tumor biology may contribute to this cancer health disparity.\nUsing laser capture microdissection, we examined genome-wide mRNA expression specific to tumor epithelium and tumor stroma in 18 African-American and 17 European-American patients. Numerous genes were differentially expressed between these two patient groups and a two-gene signature in the tumor epithelium distinguished between them. To identify the biological processes in tumors that are different by race/ethnicity, Gene Ontology and disease association analyses were performed. Several biological processes were identified which may contribute to enhanced disease aggressiveness in African-American patients, including angiogenesis and chemotaxis. African-American tumors also contained a prominent interferon signature. The role of angiogenesis in the tumor biology of African-Americans was further investigated by examining the extent of vascularization and macrophage infiltration in an expanded set of 248 breast tumors. Immunohistochemistry revealed that microvessel density and macrophage infiltration is higher in tumors of African-Americans than in tumors of European-Americans. Lastly, using an in silico approach, we explored the potential of tailored treatment options for African-American patients based on their gene expression profile. This exploratory approach generated lists of therapeutics that may have specific antagonistic activity against tumors of African-American patients, e.g., sirolimus, resveratrol, and chlorpromazine in estrogen receptor-negative tumors.\nThe gene expression profiles of breast tumors indicate that differences in tumor biology may exist between African-American and European-American patients beyond the knowledge of current markers.

Also evident was the emergence of a strong signal for GM-CSF and moderate/weak signals for MCP-1, MMP-9, Leptin, and INF gamma in a dose-dependent manner. Several of these proteins, including IL-6, IL-8, GRO, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and MCP-1, accumulate in the CTF. Other proteins are unique to tear fluid.\nNine proteins were identified that are secreted by epithelium in response to killed bacteria that contribute to the innate and adaptive defense system through potentiating PMN and macrophage recruitment, activation, and opsonization in a cooperative manner. The vast majority of these proteins are angiogenic modulators, perhaps contributing to the imbalance between angiogenic and angiostatic processes and risk of corneal vascularization.", "journal": "Current eye research", "date": "2009-02-17", "authors": ["RobertSack", "SonalSathe", "Ann RBeaton", "NancyMcNamara", "SuzanneFleiszig", "MinjianNi"], "doi": "10.1080/02713680802539869"}

Here, we show that the Tie2 agonist ligand, Ang1, was detected in lung tissue at birth and its expression gradually increased in mice, whereas its antagonist Ang2 was abundant at birth and decreased inversely with Ang1. Mice expressing the potent chimeric Ang1 protein COMP-Ang1 in surfactant protein C (SPC)-positive lung epithelial cells, showed 50% lethality at birth due to respiratory failure. Surviving mice displayed impaired adaptive responsive respiratory function. Histological analysis revealed that pulmonary artery and alveolar structure were significantly dilated, and alveolar density was decreased to approximately a third of controls.

Therefore, we analyzed in this study the manner in which the incorporation of a surgical mesh for hernia repair is affected by the immunosuppressant drugs rapamycin and cyclosporine A (CsA). For this purpose, Ultrapro meshes were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chambers of rapamycin- and CsA-treated hamsters. Untreated animals served as controls. The angiogenic and inflammatory host tissue response to the mesh implants was then analyzed over a 14-day period by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy. Mesh incorporation was determined by histology and measurement of explantation strength. Rapamycin dose-dependently inhibited vascularization of implanted meshes, as indicated by a significantly reduced number of angiogenesis-positive regions of interest and microvessel density, when compared with CsA-treated hamsters and controls. In addition, the granulation tissue surrounding the meshes of rapamycin-treated animals exhibited only a low collagen content, resulting in an impaired mesh incorporation with a significantly reduced explantation strength.

Recently, dissection of the molecular anatomy of the stomach has been boosted by the advent of functional genomics, which allows investigators to determine patterns of gene expression across virtually the entire cellular transcriptome. In this review, we discuss the impact of functional genomic studies on the understanding of gastric epithelial physiology. We show how functional genomic studies have uncovered genes that are useful as new cell lineage-specific markers of differentiation and provide new insights into cell physiology. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor B (Vegfb) has been identified as a parietal cell-specific marker that may allow parietal cells to regulate the mucosal vascular network. We also discuss how functional genomics has identified aberrantly expressed genes in disease states. Human epididymis 4 (HE4), for example, was recently identified as a metaplasia-induced gene product in mice based on microarray analysis. Finally, we will examine how analysis of higher-order patterns of gene expression can go beyond simply identifying individual genes to show how cells work as integrated systems. Specifically, we show how application of a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of gene expression patterns from multiple tissues identifies the gastric parietal cell as an outlier, unlike other differentiated cell lineages in the stomach or elsewhere in the body.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2009-02-12", "authors": ["Benjamin JCapoccia", "Won JaeHuh", "Jason CMills"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.90408.2008"}

They also modulate pituitary angiogenesis and induce tumor formation. Pituitary grafts, due to the loss of hypothalamic dopamine, also show lactotroph hyperplasia. We investigated the role of estrogen on rat pituitary autograft vascularization by light and transmission electron microscopy, and assessed prolactin (PRL) blood levels, microvessel density (MVD) and cell proliferation using the BrdU labeling index. All adenohypophysial cell types were identified by immunohistochemistry (streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method). The proangiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptor Flk-1, and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were similarly demonstrated. The prevalence of lactotrophs, as well as more intense staining for VEGF, Flk-1 and HIF-1alpha, was noted in those grafts exposed to estrogen, mainly in the area surrounding the central necrotic core. Immunostaining showed Flk-1 expression increased in endothelial cells of the estrogen-exposed grafts as compared with those unexposed. In contrast to the grafts not exposed to estrogen, in the estrogen-exposed grafts, only fenestrated endothelium could be demonstrated, suggesting that estrogen induces fenestration of newly formed capillaries. There was an increase in blood PRL levels in the estrogen-treated groups as compared with controls. Both MVD and BrdU labeling indices were higher in grafts exposed to estrogen, especially after 4 weeks. Our results suggest that estrogen administration not only enhances the expression of proangiogenic factors in the pituitary grafts but also induces their expression at earlier stages, leading to rapid neoformation of purely fenestrated capillaries.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2009-02-12", "authors": ["MatildeLombardero", "AndresQuintanar-Stephano", "SergioVidal", "EvaHorvath", "KalmanKovacs", "Ricardo VLloyd", "Bernd WScheithauer"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.01037.x"}

This study used quantitative three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler angiography to calculate the percentage change in myometrial blood flow during a relaxation-contraction-relaxation cycle of active labor.\nTransabdominal 3D power Doppler ultrasound imaging was used to acquire volumetric data during the first stage of spontaneous labor in 20 term, nulliparous women. 3D datasets were acquired during a single cycle of uterine relaxation, contraction and subsequent relaxation for each subject. The resultant datasets were analyzed independently by two investigators on two occasions using Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis to define a volume of interest within the myometrium; the power Doppler signal within this volume was quantified to provide 3D indices of vascularity: vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). The percentage change in these indices, during a uterine contraction, was calculated from the baseline value during the initial uterine relaxation phase (taken as a maximum of 100%).\nMyometrial blood flow fell significantly during the uterine contraction and returned during the subsequent relaxation phase of the cycle (P < 0.001 for VI and VFI, P = 0.002 for FI). From the initial baseline relaxation value, VI dropped to 43.9%, FI to 85.5% and VFI to 40.8% during uterine contraction, and returned to 86.7%, 98.1% and 89.1%, respectively, during the subsequent relaxation. The intraclass correlation coefficients in blood flow measurements of 0.982-0.999 between the two investigators were indicative of good interobserver reliability.\nThis study confirms that myometrial perfusion, as measured by quantitative 3D power Doppler angiography, significantly falls during uterine contractions, returns during the subsequent relaxation phase, and can be quantified reliably from stored datasets.

Proliferating cells have long been known to contain more magnesium than quiescent cells, and experimental conditions that decreased magnesium availability affected cell proliferation rate. There is little information about how tumor growth influenced systemic availability of magnesium in a patient, nor is it clear whether treatment-associated changes of magnesaemia influenced tumor growth and dissemination. Hypomagnesaemia is observed during multi-agent therapies with cisplatin or the anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab. The latter was shown to cause hypomagnesaemia by impeding EGF-dependent activation of TRPM6, the main cation channel responsible for Mg transcellular absorption in the intestine and kidney. Limited observations also suggest that hypomagnesaemia could favorably influence tumor response to cetuximab. All such findings brought magnesium into the arena of clinical oncology, but potential caveats should be kept in mind before considering practical implications. We briefly review that magnesium causes pleiotropic, often diverging effects on tumor growth, vascularization, and metastatization, such that both favorable and unfavorable effects can be identified.

Endothelial cell-like differentiated precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells, EPC) enhance the neovascularization, while marrow stromal cells (MSC) promote the repair of bone defects. Our aim was to evaluate if both types of cells can be cocultivated on a beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) matrix and maintain their differentiation capacity as well as to analyze the biologic activity of these cell constructs in vivo.\nMSC from human bone marrow and EPC from buffy coat were used. EPC and MSC, alone or in combination, were seeded on fibronectin-coated beta-TCP. After 2, 6, and 10 days the metabolic activity and the endothelial differentiation were tested. On day 10 real-time RT-PCRs for endothelial genes (von Willebrandt factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2), osteogenic genes (osteocalcin, cbfa-1, and collagen-1alpha), and the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were performed. Cell-containing constructs were implanted into the critical-size defect of the femur of the nude rat. Bone formation and vascularization was determined after 1 week.\nMSC and EPC on beta-TCP remain metabolically active over 10 days. They maintain their differentiation as measured by means of Dil-ac-LDL uptake (EPC) and gene expression of lineage typical genes (EPC + MSC). Although a potential osteogenic differentiation of MSC was maybe affected negatively, constructs loaded with MSC resulted in an increase of new bone mass. Constructs containing EPC resulted in an improved vasculogenesis in vivo.\nMSC and EPC can be cultivated in combination on a fibronectin-coated beta-TCP, thereby partly maintaining their lineage typical gene expression. The results of the in vivo examinations suggest that beta-TCP combined with EPC and MSC can used as a suitable tool to foster bone healing.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

A single examiner (J. L. A.) acquired all the volumes according to a predetermined scanning protocol. Two different observers (one inexperienced and the other experienced) calculated 3D-PDA vascular indices (vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) from solid tumor areas. First, manual sampling (Plane A, 15 degrees rotation-step) was performed, and 1 week later 5-cm(3) sphere sampling from the most vascularized area was carried out. The observers made a record of any difficulty that they encountered in delineating the solid areas of tumors or in distinguishing true tumor vessels from pre-existing vessels, the time spent performing each analysis was recorded and inter- and intraobserver reproducibility was evaluated for each method using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).\nIn four (19.0%) of the 21 volumes sphere sampling could not be performed because it was not possible to obtain a sphere smaller than 5.5 cm(3). This happened in cases in which image zooming was used when acquiring the 3D volume. The inexperienced observer encountered more difficulty, but not significantly more, than the experienced observer when analyzing 3D-PDA volumes both by manual sampling (29% vs. 14% of cases) and 5-cm(3) sphere sampling (35% vs. 18% of cases). The mean time spent by the inexperienced observer was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than that spent by the experienced observer both for manual sampling (6.11 min vs. 1.85 min) and 5-cm(3) sphere sampling (2.93 min vs. 2.15 min). Contrary to the findings for the experienced observer, the inexperienced observer required less time to perform sphere sampling than they did manual sampling. Interobserver agreement was high for both methods: ICC for manual volume, 0.993; manual VI, 0.908; manual FI, 0.913; manual VFI, 0.914; sphere volume, 0.949; sphere VI, 0.954; sphere FI 0.850; and sphere VFI, 0.953. Intraobserver reproducibility was also high, with all ICCs above 0.99.\nManual and 5-cm(3) sphere sampling are reproducible methods for 3D-PDA vascular sampling. Caution is required when image zoom is used at the time of acquiring the volume because this may prevent sphere sampling. Difficulties found in performing both manual and sphere sampling do not seem to significantly affect the reproducibility of Doppler index calculations.", "journal": "Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology", "date": "2009-02-10", "authors": ["J LAlc\u00e1zar", "MPrka"], "doi": "10.1002/uog.6312"}

Chemicals can also be exchanged across this patch. Atrazine (ATZ), a widespread herbicide, continues to be a concern among amphibian ecologists based on potential exposure and toxicity. Few studies have examined its impact on the terrestrial juvenile or adult stages of toads. In the current study, we asked the following questions: (1) Will juvenile American toads (Bufo americanus) avoid soils contaminated with ATZ? (2) Can they absorb ATZ across the pelvic patch? (3) If so, how is it distributed among the organs and eventually eliminated? We conducted a behavioral choice test between control soil and soil dosed with ecologically relevant concentrations of ATZ. In addition, we examined the uptake, distribution, and elimination of water dosed with (14)C-labeled ATZ. Our data demonstrate that toads do not avoid ATZ-laden soils. ATZ crossed the pelvic patch rapidly and reached an apparent equilibrium within 5 h. The majority of the radiolabeled ATZ ended up in the intestines, whereas the greatest concentrations were observed in the gall bladder. Thus, exposure of adult life stages of amphibians through direct uptake of ATZ from soils and runoff water should be considered in risk evaluations.", "journal": "Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology", "date": "2009-02-10", "authors": ["S IStorrs M\u00e9ndez", "D ETillitt", "T A GRittenhouse", "R DSemlitsch"], "doi": "10.1007/s00244-009-9292-0"}
{"title": "Vascular engineering using human embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Engineering vascularized tissue constructs remains a major problem in regenerative medicine. The formation of such a microvasculature--like the vasculogenesis in early embryogenesis that it closely resembles--is guided by biochemical and biophysical cues, such as growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, hypoxia, and hydrodynamic shear. As they undergo spontaneous and directed vascular differentiation, human embryonic stem cells can be used as a model system to explore central issues in engineering vascularized tissue constructs and, potentially, to elucidate vasculogenic and angiogenic mechanisms involved in such vascular diseases as limb and cardiac ischemia. Because the conventional spontaneous differentiation approach can only isolate small quantities of vascular cells, recent efforts have sought to develop controlled approaches, including the development of three-dimensional scaffolds to reengineer the microenvironments of early embryogenesis. This review focuses on emerging approaches to deriving and directing vasculatures from human embryonic stem cells and efforts to engineer 3D vasculatures from such derivatives.", "journal": "Biotechnology progress", "date": "2009-02-07", "authors": ["DonnyHanjaya-Putra", "SharonGerecht"], "doi": "10.1002/btpr.129"}

Although recent publications show promising results, these studies were generally performed with clinically irrelevant endothelial cell model systems. We tested the use of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) obtained from umbilical cord blood and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) from the bone marrow for their use in a prevascularized bone tissue engineering setting. MSC were differentiated toward endothelial cells. They formed capillary-like structures containing lumen, stained positive for CD31, attained the ability to take up acetylated low-density lipoproteins, and formed perfused vessels in vivo. However, in a three-dimensional coculture setting with undifferentiated hMSC, the cells stopped expressing CD31 and did not form prevascular structures. EPC from the cord blood were able to form prevascular structures in the same coculture setting, but only when the state of endothelial differentiation was mature. The amount of prevascular structures formed when using EPC was less than when human umbilical vein endothelial cells or human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were used. The degree of organization, however, was higher. We conclude that EPC can be used for complex tissue engineering applications, but the differentiation stage of these cells is important.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

After 56 days, the implants with low and high levels of bFGF weighed five and eight times more, respectively, than the implants without bFGF delivery. The implants with bFGF-encapsulated microspheres also contained significantly more cells than the implants without bFGF delivery. The levels of adrenal cortical gene expression were not significantly changed with bFGF delivery. The implants with high levels of bFGF also had a more uniform distribution of anti-CD31 immunofluorescence.

We therefore examined this collaboration in both silicone- and collagen-based nerve conduits in both 5- and 10-mm-injury gaps in rat sciatic nerves. Results indicate that collagen conduits promoted enhanced axonal and SC regeneration and association when compared to silicone conduits in the shorter 5-mm-gap model. In addition, collagen tubes displayed enhanced neovascularization over silicone conduits, suggesting that these three factors are intimately related in successful peripheral nerve regeneration. At later time points (1- and 2-month analysis) in a 10-mm-gap model, collagen tubes displayed enhanced axonal regeneration, myelination, and vascularization when compared to silicone-based conduits.

{"title": "The Allantoic Core Domain: new insights into development of the murine allantois and its relation to the primitive streak.", "abstract": "The whereabouts and properties of the posterior end of the primitive streak have not been identified in any species. In the mouse, the streak's posterior terminus is assumed to be confined to the embryonic compartment, and to give rise to the allantois, which links the embryo to its mother during pregnancy. In this study, we have refined our understanding of the biology of the murine posterior primitive streak and its relation to the allantois. Through a combination of immunostaining and morphology, we demonstrate that the primitive streak spans the posterior extraembryonic and embryonic regions at the onset of the neural plate stage ( approximately 7.0 days postcoitum, dpc). Several hours later, the allantoic bud emerges from the extraembryonic component of the primitive streak (XPS). Then, possibly in collaboration with overlying allantois-associated extraembryonic visceral endoderm, the XPS establishes a germinal center within the allantois, named here the Allantoic Core Domain (ACD). Microsurgical removal of the ACD beyond headfold (HF) stages resulted in the formation of allantoic regenerates that lacked the ACD and failed to elongate; nevertheless, vasculogenesis and vascular patterning proceeded. In situ and transplantation fate mapping demonstrated that, from HF stages onward, the ACD's progenitor pool contributed to the allantois exclusive of the proximal flanks. By contrast, the posterior intraembryonic primitive streak (IPS) provided the flanks. Grafting the ACD into T(C)/T(C) hosts, whose allantoises are significantly foreshortened, restored allantoic elongation. These results revealed that the ACD is essential for allantoic elongation, but the cues required for vascularization lie outside of it. On the basis of these and previous findings, we conclude that the posterior primitive streak of the mouse conceptus is far more complex than was previously believed.

Neoangiogenesis was reduced by Cb2 treatment, as observed at gross morphological level and by significant changes in gene expression.

Due to arterial vascularization of metastases, transarterial embolization (TAE) is a suitable procedure, which can also be combined with chemotherapeutic agents. Indications for embolization or chemoembolization (TACE) are growth of liver metastases or inadequate symptom control. The majority of patients show clinical improvement and partial remission can be achieved in 50% of cases with 5-year survival rates of 50-60%. Response rates, survival or complications are not dependent on the embolization technique (TAE or TACE). Embolization is usually performed in several sessions depending on individual tumor stage and disease progression. Embolization is a cost-effective procedure and is included in the treatment algorithm of international guidelines. Therefore, evaluation of new embolization therapies must be evaluated in randomized controlled studies.", "journal": "Der Radiologe", "date": "2009-02-03", "authors": ["MLibicher", "HBovenschulte"], "doi": "10.1007/s00117-008-1787-6"}

The material was collected at Goi\u00e1s Carnes Freezer Warehouse in Goiania, Goias. It was found that the deep lingual artery penetrated the lower lateral region of the prominence of the dorsal area of the tongue, advancing rostrally between the hyoid bone and the hypoglossal muscle. In the intravisceral initial third, the artery represents the deep, sinuous continuation branch of the lingual artery, in which path the sublingual artery was stressed in the ventral plan. Then, the artery deepened in the interior of the hypoglossal muscles and genioglossal, supplying dorsal branches (from three to nine) for the lingual torus; from one to five dorsal collateral branches for the lingual cavity; and one or two ventral collateral branches. At the lingual apex, the artery undergoes bifurcation supplying collateral, dorsal and ventral branches with anastomoses between the parallel vessels in the same antimere and between branches of lower caliber hierarchy between opposite antemeres. The large presence of microvessels indicates a significant blood supply to the organ.

Distinct compartments have now been identified on the face, trunk, and extremities. Septal boundaries have been noted on histologic evaluation. Despite these observations, a unifying explanation for the compartmentalization of adipose tissue has not been presented.\nTwenty hemifacial cadaver specimens were obtained from the University of Texas Southwestern Willed Body Program. In 10 hemifaces, latex injection of the common carotid arteries was performed in conjunction with dye injection of fat to identify perforator vessels and source vessels associated with each compartment. The radiologic characteristics of the vascular network were further evaluated in 10 additional hemifaces using three-dimensional computed tomographic scanning. A lead oxide/gelatin mixture was injected into the common carotid arteries, and iodinated contrast was injected directly into the fat compartment.\nThe perforator blood supply to the skin runs with, and is stabilized by, condensations of fascia. Each anatomical compartment evaluated in this study was associated with an identifiable artery or vein. Three-dimensional computed tomography after intravenous contrast injection confirmed the arrangement of perforator vessels running in the septal boundaries of each subcutaneous fat compartment.\nThe subcutaneous tissue of the human body is partitioned by fibrous membranes that carry the perforator blood supply to the skin. Each anatomical compartment studied has an identifiable vessel that runs along its boundary. This interlocking connective tissue network provides stability and protection for the vascular supply to the face during facial animation. The anatomical arrangement of the subcutaneous tissues of the face and their associated vasculature is therefore highly organized, and could be related to the embryologic development of the facial musculature.

This technique uses a lateral or medial pedicle based on W\u00fcringer's horizontal septum, which carries the main nerve supply to the nipple in addition to intercostal perforators.\nMean nipple-to-sternal notch distance was 33 cm (range, 22 to 45 cm).

Total areola necrosis occurred in one breast (0.5 percent) as a result of an infection in a diabetic patient. Limited wound dehiscence occurred in 15 breasts (7.7 percent). A secondary scar revision was needed in 10 patients (9 percent).

Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds have various effects on living organisms and are also contained in cigarette smoke. However, the effects of dioxins on the eye remain elusive. In this study, the authors examined the association between dioxins and neovascularization in the eye.\nC57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) every other day for 14 days. Messenger RNA expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1, CYP1B1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and VEGF-B, and VEGF production were examined in the eyes of TCDD-treated mice and in human retinal pigment epithelial cell lines (ARPE-19) exposed to TCDD. In addition, CNV was induced by photocoagulation in mice injected with TCDD, and the volume of CNV was compared by fluorescence-labeled choroidal flat mount.\nTCDD injected intraperitoneally increased CYP1A1 mRNA expression in the iris/ciliary body and retina, indicating that TCDD acts directly on ocular tissues through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) to promote the transcription of target genes. TCDD also promoted VEGF-A mRNA expression in the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. TCDD-induced VEGF production at the molecular level was also observed in vivo by immunohistochemistry and in vitro using ARPE-19. Moreover, the injection of TCDD significantly exacerbated photocoagulation-induced CNV in mice.\nThe authors demonstrate that dioxins are among the factors inducing abnormal vascularization in the eye through VEGF production mediated by AhR signaling.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2009-02-03", "authors": ["AyaTakeuchi", "MasaruTakeuchi", "KosukeOikawa", "Koh-heiSonoda", "YoshihikoUsui", "YokoOkunuki", "AtsunobuTakeda", "YujiOshima", "KeiichiYoshida", "MasahikoUsui", "HiroshiGoto", "MasahikoKuroda"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.08-2299"}

The authors describe their experiences with such injuries in 15 patients.\nFifteen patients were operated by the same surgeon in Afghanistan and Ivory Coast for bone exposure on the leg after war or roadcrash injuries.

The delay between the flap and the first injury was about 42 days.\nThe duration of hospitalization following the flap was about eight days. Cicatrization was complete after 25 days. Three patients had complications: one partial necrosis of the skin, one sepsis, and one patient had a leg amputation.\nIn precarious conditions, the management of bone exposure in local civilians and soldiers is limited by the conditions in their country or the conditions at the field hospital. The treatment must be simple and reliable because it may be difficult to perform patient follow-up. A pedicled flap provides new vascularized tissue with anti-infectious properties. Classical indications are: muscular flaps for the proximal and the middle part of the leg; sural flaps for the middle and the distal-third part. In substantial soft-tissue defects, amputation must be discussed.\nThe pedicled flap is an essential technique for fighting against infection, especially in cases where only poor technical and medicinal resources are available.

Murine quadriceps muscles were transfected with DNA encoding for human HIF-1 alpha, which resulted in a local, but lasting expression (mRNA and protein, where the latter had nuclear localization). Subjection of isolated hearts to global ischemia and reperfusion 1, 4, and 8 weeks after gene delivery resulted in infarct size reduction (p < 0.05). Supporting that this was due to paracrine effects, HL-1 cells treated with conditioned media from cells transfected with HIF-1 alpha or serum from HIF-1 alpha-treated mice were protected against H(2)O(2)-induced cell death (p < 0.05, respectively). The latter protection was reduced when a heme oxygenase activity blocker was used. Taqman low-density array of 47 HIF-1 alpha-regulated genes at the treatment site showed nine specific upregulations (p < 0.05). Of the corresponding proteins, PDGF-B and adrenomedullin were upregulated in the heart. HIF-1 alpha treatment induced an increased vascularization of the heart and skeletal muscle.

Nude rats were treated with CTX (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 24 hours before human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3), small cell lung carcinoma (LX-1 SCLC), and glioma (UW28, U87MG, and U251) tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or in the right cerebral hemisphere or were infused into the right internal carotid artery. Tumor development was monitored and recorded. Potential mechanisms were further investigated. Only animals that received both CTX and Matrigel showed consistent growth of subcutaneous tumors. Cyclophosphamide pretreatment increased the percentage (83.3% vs 0%) of animals showing intraperitoneal tumors. In intracerebral implantation tumor models, CTX pretreatment increased the tumor volume and the percentage of animals showing tumors. Cyclophosphamide increased lung carcinoma bone and facial metastases after intra-arterial injection, and 20% of animals showed brain metastases. Cyclophosphamide transiently decreased nude rat white blood cell counts and glutathione concentration, whereas serum vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly elevated. Cyclophosphamide also increased CD31 reactivity, a marker of vascular endothelium, and macrophage (CD68-positive) infiltration into glioma cell-inoculated rat brains. Cyclophosphamide may enhance primary and metastatic tumor growth through multiple mechanisms, including immune modulation, decreased response to oxidative stress, increased tumor vascularization, and increased macrophage infiltration.

This bacterial vector was seen to rapidly migrate into, and thrive in, hypoxic areas of both mammary tumor spheroids grown in vitro and orthotopic mammary tumors after systemic injection. Using the reporter gene construct, FF+20(*)-lacZ, we show that bacterial expression of high levels of beta-galactosidase occurred only in hypoxic/necrotic sites of spheroids and tumors. We then replaced the reporter gene with one encoding a novel cytotoxic protein (HlyE) and showed that this was also expressed by bacteria only in hypoxic regions of murine mammary tumors. This resulted in a marked increase in tumor necrosis and reduced tumor growth. Our system represents a promising new strategy for delivering gene therapy to poorly vascularized regions of tumors and shows, for the first time, the efficacy of HlyE as an anti-tumor agent.", "journal": "Gene therapy", "date": "2009-01-30", "authors": ["R MRyan", "JGreen", "P JWilliams", "STazzyman", "SHunt", "J HHarmey", "S CKehoe", "C ELewis"], "doi": "10.1038/gt.2008.188"}

The transformation into pseudocysts is termed germinolysis. Interestingly, identical ultrasonographic findings are rarely even reported for near-term infants. We examined 5 cases of near-term infants presenting with various localized subventricular echodensities after various noncerebral infections (intra-amniotic infection, gastroenteritis of unidentified pathogens, septic wound, and a twin pair with rotavirus gastroenteritis), suggesting an inflammatory or ischemic rather than a hemorrhagic etiology. With high-resolution ultrasonography, these lesions showed similar characteristics: all were space-occupying, homogeneous, echodense, and ultimately transformed into pseudocysts. Additionally, Doppler ultrasonography showed linear perivascular echodensities in the basal ganglia of one infant. All infants were also examined by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences so that subventricular hemorrhages could be excluded in 4 infants. One of these 4 infants died unexpectedly at home. Brain autopsy revealed nonhemorrhagic germinal matrix pseudocysts with gliotic walls. Based on our findings and the original literature, we favored an ischemic infarction of the strongly vascularized and highly metabolic germinal matrix as cause of this germinolysis and gliosis. We postulated that the infarction was the result of an obstructive and possibly mineralizing, or even fossilizing vasculopathy due to an inflammatory response. The precise pathogenesis of the suspected immune-mediated vasculitis remains unknown.

Here, we show that MPs(Shh+) induce the formation of capillary-like structures in an in vitro model using human endothelial cells, although they inhibited cell migration. Besides, MPs(Shh+) regulate cell proliferation. Both cell adhesion and expression of proteins involved in this process such as Rho A and phosphorylation of focal-activated kinase were increased by MPs(Shh+), via a Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase inhibitor-sensitive pathway. We demonstrate that MPs(Shh+) increase messenger RNA and protein levels of proangiogenic factors as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot. In spite of vascular endothelial growth factor expression, conditioned media from endothelial cells treated avec MPs(Shh+) reduces angiogenesis. Interestingly, the effects induced by MPs(Shh+) on the formation of capillary-like structures, expression of adhesion molecules and proangiogenic factors were reversed after silencing of the Shh receptor, using small interfering RNA or when Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling was pharmacologically inhibited with cyclopamine. Taken together, we show that Shh carried by MPs(Shh+) regulate angiogenesis probably through both a direct and an indirect mechanisms, and we propose that MPs harboring Shh may contribute to the generation of a vascular network in pathologies associated with tumor growth.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2009-01-27", "authors": ["RaffaellaSoleti", "TarekBenameur", "ChiaraPorro", "Maria AntoniettaPanaro", "RamarosonAndriantsitohaina", "Maria CarmenMart\u00ednez"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgp030"}

This surgical procedure avoids nephronic waste with an acceptable morbidity and similar oncological outcomes compared to radical surgery. Recent large published series did not show any difference between NSS and RN in terms of oncological safety. Specific and disease-free five-year survival rates (82% to 97.3% and 81% to 97.3%, respectively) have confirmed the safety of NSS. Regarding laparoscopic NSS, the technique is still under evaluation and only mid-term outcomes are available so far. However, these studies are still limited and longer follow-up is needed before any definitive statement can be made. Current guidelines recommend NSS only in case of RCC of less than 4 cm in diameter in elective indications. In daily practice however, surgical teams are pushing back the limit above the threshold of 4 cm. More and more surgeons are either considering anatomical location or technical expected difficulties rather than just the tumour size. NSS leads to higher risk of bleeding, especially in case of tumours larger than 4 cm.

Although subdural hemorrhage is frequently traumatic, there are nontraumatic conditions associated with subdural hemorrhage, and the inner dural plexus is a likely source of bleeding in these nontraumatic circumstances.

The mRNA content (real-time PCR) of 26 genes was quantified in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies from 28 healthy men with a wide range of BMI. ATBF was measured by 133Xe washout. None of the transcripts was related to fasting ATBF (ATBFF). However, the expression levels of two transcripts involved in vasodilation (natriuretic peptide receptor A/guanylate cyclase A (NPRA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)) were positively associated with postprandial ATBF (r = 0.53 and r = 0.55, P < 0.01, respectively). Although BMI was negatively related to the mRNA content of NPRA and eNOS (r = -0.78 and r = -0.63, P < 0.01, respectively), the strong associations found between postprandial ATBF and the two transcripts were not affected by obesity. Several genes were subject to coordinated regulation of expression. This study demonstrates for the first time that ATBF responsiveness to nutrient intake is related to the transcription of two genes expressed in adipose tissue and directly involved in vasodilatory actions (eNOS and NPRA), suggesting that part of the regulation of ATBF is at a transcriptional level.

{"title": "The influence of the sequential delivery of angiogenic factors from affinity-binding alginate scaffolds on vascularization.", "abstract": "This study describes the features of tissue-engineering scaffold capable of sequentially delivering three angiogenic factors. The scaffold consists of alginate-sulfate/alginate, wherein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are bound to alginate-sulfate with an affinity similar to that realized upon their binding to heparin. Factor release rate from the scaffold was correlated with the equilibrium binding constants of the factors to the matrix, thus enabling the sequential delivery of VEGF, PDGF-BB and TGF-beta1. In alginate scaffolds lacking alginate-sulfate, release of the adsorbed proteins was instantaneous. After subcutaneous implantation for 1 and 3 months in rats, the blood vessel density and percentage of mature vessels were 3-fold greater in the triple factor-bound scaffolds than in the factor-adsorbed or untreated scaffolds. Moreover, vascularization within the triple factor-bound scaffolds was superior to that found in scaffolds delivering only basic fibroblast growth factor. Application of this novel scaffold may be extended to the combined delivery of additional heparin-binding angiogenic factors or combinations of growth factors active in different tissue regeneration processes.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2009-01-21", "authors": ["InbarFreeman", "SmadarCohen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.057"}

Here, we establish a novel adhesiogenic model in the rabbit to analyze the phenotype and proliferation in vitro of cells comprising adhesion tissue seven days postsurgery. Adhesion-free omentum tissue was used as control. Cells derived from adhesions and from the control omentum were subcultured and characterized through immunofluorescence and Western blotting procedures to determine markers of cell differentiation and pluripotential, and viability and proliferation assays. Our findings indicate the existence of a mesenchymal population in the omentum revealed by markers of pluripotent cells with high angiogenic capacity. This population seems to be responsible for the adhesions formed in response to mesothelial damage. Depending on the local environment, mesenchymal cells are capable of in vivo differentiation towards at least two different cell phenotypes rendering two types of adhesions with clearly differentiated characteristics. One type of adhesion shows a highly vascularized adipose morphology containing cells differentiating into a vascular lineage.

{"title": "2-methoxyestradiol as a potential cytostatic drug in gliomas?", "abstract": "Gliomas of astrocytic origin show only a limited chemotherapy response. Chemoresistance is most pronounced in glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most malignant glioma, with median survival times not much longer than one year. Failure of chemotherapy partly relies on protective mechanisms against the commonly used DNA alkylating agents, but also on the constitutive activation of the pro-survival PI3K-Akt pathway in glioma cells, which inhibits apoptosis. Therefore, new drugs with an alternative mechanism, independent of DNA alkylation, are required. The microtubule targeting drug 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) efficiently induces mitotic arrest, apoptosis, but also autophagic cell death in glioma cells in vitro. Moreover, it may be able to inhibit vascularization of the highly vascular gliobastomas, because the drug influences blood vessel sprouting via a HIF-1-dependent mechanism. Although high doses of i.p. injected 2-ME were recently shown to be effective in an orthothopic rat glioma model, clinical phase I/II trials revealed low oral bioavailability. One of the most exciting future perspectives will be the currently ongoing development of improved 2-ME analogs.

Almost no data are available regarding whether the effect of aging prevails over pathological conditions, despite the classic description that glomic fibrosis increases with age.\nTo morphometrically characterize the alterations of the carotid barochemoreceptors and their supplying arteries.\nPatients (n=23) who had suffered and died from stroke, with and without complicated internal carotid atheromatosis, were divided by age (group 1: older than 80 years; group 2: 65 to 80 years; and group 3: younger than 65 years). Carotid segments were obtained at autopsy. The specimens were stained for light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\nCarotid glomus presented from moderate-to-severe atrophy and fibrosis. A focal decrease in vascularization (CD34-positive) of the glomus (greater than 50%) was observed in areas of atrophy and fibrosis. Damaged nerve endings (S100 protein-positive) were observed at the media of the carotid sinus. Morphometric data showed no differences between groups for glomus area, number of type 1 and 2 cells, and the wall to lumen arteriole ratio. No statistical differences were demonstrated in the pathological findings of the carotid glomus when comparing complicated with noncomplicated plaques or age groups.\nSevere carotid chemoreceptor damage exists in patients who have died from stroke and suffered from carotid atheromatosis.

It was also reported that the patients with moyamoya disease are more vulnerable to cerebral hyperperfusion such as postoperative hemorrhagic complication after extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery despite its low flow revascularization. However, the underlying mechanisms of its pathologic angiogenesis and the occurrence of hemorrhage are undetermined. Excessive degradation of the vascular matrix by MMPs, proteolytic enzymes that degrade all the components of extracellular matrix, can lead to instability of the vascular structure and can thereby cause bleeding. The MMPs also play an important role in tissue remodeling including angiogenesis in both physiologic and pathologic condition.\nWe examined the serum levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 16 cases with definitive moyamoya disease by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared them with those from healthy controls.\nThe serum MMP-9 level was significantly higher in moyamoya disease (40.18 ng/mL) than in healthy controls (13.75 ng/mL, P = .0372). There was no difference in serum MMP-2 level between moyamoya disease (646.65 ng/mL) and healthy control (677.60 ng/mL).

As multidrug-resistant neuroblastoma cells are highly sensitive to arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in vitro and in vivo, we here studied the cytotoxic effects of As2O3 on SCLC cells. As2O3 induced pronounced cell death in SCLC cells at clinically relevant concentrations, and also at hypoxia. SCLC cells were more sensitive than non-SCLC cells to As2O3. Cell death was mainly due to necrosis, although apoptotic responses were also seen. A significant in vivo effect of As2O3 on SCLC growth was shown in a nude mice-xenograft model, although a fraction of the treated tumor-bearing animals did not respond. The nonresponding SCLC tumors differed in morphology and cell organization compared with treatment-responsive tumors, which in turn, showed decreased vascularization and higher expression of neuroendocrine markers compared with control tumors. Our results suggest a potential clinical application of As2O3 in SCLC therapy.

The aims of our study were to assess the prevalence of RAS and to examine the frequency of variants of renal vasculature, that is, multiple and/or accessory renal arteries in hypertensive patients referred to renal angiography. We evaluated retrospectively 1554 arteriographies of hypertensive patients. Angiograms were evaluated to find RAS, significant RAS (>60% stenosis of the lumen), radiological signs of atherosclerosis, aneurysms of the renal arteries or aorta and variants of kidney vascularization. The frequency of RAS including occlusions was 15.1% (21.3% of them were significant and suitable for revascularization). Variants of renal arterial vascularization were found in 26.5% of patients (multiple renal arteries-11.2% and accessory renal arteries-15.3%). Significant RAS was found more frequently in patients older than 60 years-OR 4.76 (2.08-10.86). Coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction or stroke significantly increased the chance of RAS detection. The frequency of renal accessory arteries was lower in patients older than 60 years and in patients with the radiological signs of atherosclerosis.

From day 50 to day 135 of pregnancy (tissue collection day), a portion of the ewes from ASe and HSe groups were fed restricted (R; 60% of M) diet. Fetal ovarian sections were stained for: 1) the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker of proliferating cells) to determine the proportion of proliferating primordial follicles, or the labeling index (LI; percentage of proliferating cells) for primordial, primary, secondary and antral follicles, stromal tissues, and blood vessels; 2) factor VIII (a marker of endothelial cells) or 3) a presence of apoptotic cells/bodies. The number of proliferating primordial follicles and the LI of primordial follicles was decreased by R and/or HSe diets. The LI was similar for theca and granulosa cells, and for secondary or antral follicles, but was greater in secondary and antral than in primordial and primary follicles. R diet and/or Se affected the LI in all follicle types, in stromal tissues and blood vessels. A dense network of blood vessels was detected in the areas containing secondary to antral follicles, medulla, and hilus, but areas containing primordial follicles were poorly vascularized. The number of apoptotic cells was minimal. These results demonstrate that nutrient restriction and/or Se level in the maternal diet affected cellular proliferation in follicles, blood vessels, and stromal tissues in fetal ovaries. Thus, plane of nutrition and Se in the maternal diet may impact fetal ovarian development and function.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2009-01-09", "authors": ["Anna TGrazul-Bilska", "Joel SCaton", "WendyArndt", "KellyBurchill", "ClaytonThorson", "EwaBorowczyk", "Jerzy JBilski", "Dale ARedmer", "Lawrence PReynolds", "Kimberly AVonnahme"], "doi": "10.1530/REP-08-0375"}
{"title": "Role of vascular endothelial growth factor in the communication between human osteoprogenitors and endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Proper bone remodeling requires an active process of angiogenesis which in turn supplies the necessary growth factors and stem cells. This tissue cooperation suggests a cross-talk between osteoblasts and endothelial cells. This work aims to identify the role of paracrine communication through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in co-culture between osteoblastic and endothelial cells. Through a well defined direct contact co-culture model between human osteoprogenitors (HOPs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we observed that HUVECs were able to migrate along HOPs, inducing the formation of specific tubular-like structures. VEGF(165) gene expression was detected in the HOPs, was up-regulated in the co-cultured HOPs and both Flt-1 and KDR gene expression increased in co-cultured HUVECs. However, the cell rearrangement observed in co-culture was promoted by a combination of soluble chemoattractive factors and not by VEGF(165) alone. Despite having no observable effect on endothelial cell tubular-like formation, VEGF appeared to have a crucial role in osteoblastic differentiation since the inhibition of its receptors reduced the co-culture-stimulated osteoblastic phenotype. This co-culture system appears to enhance both primary angiogenesis events and osteoblastic differentiation, thus allowing for the development of new strategies in vascularized bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2009-01-08", "authors": ["MaritieGrellier", "NancyFerreira-Tojais", "ChantalBourget", "ReineBareille", "FabienGuillemot", "Jo\u00eblleAm\u00e9d\u00e9e"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.22018"}

A hydrogel system was used to examine the role of the transition from 2D to 3D culture, with and without integrin engagement, on cancer cell angiogenic capability. Three-dimensional culture recreated tumor microenvironmental cues and led to enhanced interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion that depended on integrin engagement with adhesion peptides coupled to the polymer. In contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion was unaffected by 3D culture with or without substrate adhesion. IL-8 diffused greater distances and was present in higher concentrations in the systemic circulation, relative to VEGF. Implantation of a polymeric IL-8 delivery system into GFP bone marrow-transplanted mice revealed that localized IL-8 up-regulation was critical to both the local and systemic control of tumor vascularization in vivo. In summary, 3D integrin engagement within tumor microenvironments regulates cancer cell angiogenic signaling, and controlled local and systemic blockade of both IL-8 and VEGF signaling may improve antiangiogenic therapies.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2009-01-08", "authors": ["ClaudiaFischbach", "Hyun JoonKong", "Susan XHsiong", "Marta BEvangelista", "WillYuen", "David JMooney"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0808932106"}

The intent had been to increase the maturity status of VEGF-generated vessels in the implant site by co-delivery of PlGF and thereby to effect an improvement in the persistence of luciferase expression, a marker of encapsulated cell viability. L929 cells were doubly transfected with luciferase and PlGF or luciferase and VEGF. Two hundred microcapsules containing a 1:1 mixture of the two transfected cells were implanted minimally invasively in Matrigel on one side of the mouse; the other side contained 200 microcapsules containing cells expressing luciferase only. Luciferase expression, reflective of encapsulated cell number, peaked at day 21 in both groups at about three times the value at day 1. In contrast with the immature vessels produced with VEGF alone (as reported earlier), the vessels produced here were more mature at day 14, and there were more such vessels than in the control group, although by day 21, there was a mixture of mature and immature vessels with PlGF, consistent with the premise that the maturity status of new vessels is PlGF dose dependent. Furthermore, anti-L929 antibodies (according to flow cytometry) and CD3-positive cells (according to histology) were detected in mice receiving unencapsulated cells, suggesting that there may be minor MHC (major histocompatibility complex) alloantigens and an adaptive immune response in this animal model.

{"title": "Current developments for pelvic exenteration in gynecologic oncology.", "abstract": "The present review aims to update new techniques of pelvic exenteration including minimal invasive surgery, and discuss other aspects of this radical surgery, including worldwide differences.\nMajor advances are made since the first description of pelvic exenteration and the operation is still under evolution. Explorative laparoscopy prior to exenteration is a valuable alternative to laparotomy to elect candidates for pelvic exenteration. There are considerable differences with respect to indications, contraindications, preoperative staging and adjuvant therapy after exenteration in different countries. Advances in laparoscopic instruments also led to the laparoscopic exenteration. The main limiting step of the operation is urinary diversion. New techniques of laparoscopic-assisted and robotic-assisted techniques of urinary diversion have been reported that decrease the operation time. Vascularized muscle flaps are preferred by many surgeons to fill the empty pelvis and provide an acceptable vaginal reconstruction. J-pouch seems to be a safer technique than end-to-end coloanal anastomosis for bowel reconstruction. Developments in the bioengineering tissue for pelvic reconstruction are required.\nLaparoscopy has the advantages of decreased blood loss, improved convalescence, lower incidence of wound infection and incisional hernia, short recovery periods, rapid return of bowel function, better pain control and improved cosmetics compared with laparotomy for pelvic exenteration. Magnification and improved visualization permits en-bloc dissection of tumor and good anastomosis technique.

Necropsy was performed at 120 days, and explants were evaluated for adhesion grade, adhesion amount, and mesh contraction. Histologic evaluation included extent of capsule formation, abdominal wall tissue ingrowth, degrees of inflammation and vascularization of the surrounding tissue, and the presence of mesothelialization. Results. There were no significant differences between the C-Qur mesh and the commercially available meshes tested with regard to adhesion grade or amount, although percentage adhesion coverage for the C-Qur mesh was much less than for Composix and Proceed. The C-Qur mesh contracted less than all meshes, significantly less (P < .05) than DualMesh or Proceed. DualMesh exhibited the greatest amount of capsule formation and inflammation on its parietal side as compared with the other meshes.\nPlacing lightweight polypropylene mesh with an omega-3 fatty acid barrier coating intraperitoneally results in more favorable adhesion characteristics compared with Composix and Proceed meshes at 120-day explantation after intraperitoneal placement.

TSP2-null mice show accelerated dermal wound healing and enhanced bone formation. We hypothesized that bone regeneration would be enhanced in the absence of TSP2. Closed, semistabilized transverse fractures were created in the tibias of wildtype (WT) and TSP2-null mice. The fractures were examined 5, 10, and 20 days after fracture using microCT, histology, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR, and torsional mechanical testing. Ten days after fracture, TSP2-null mice showed 30% more bone by microCT and 40% less cartilage by histology. Twenty days after fracture, TSP2-null mice showed reduced bone volume fraction and BMD. Mice were examined 5 days after fracture during the stage of neovascularization and mesenchymal cell influx to determine a cellular explanation for the phenotype. TSP2-null mice showed increased cell proliferation with no difference in apoptosis in the highly cellular fracture callus. Although mature bone and cartilage is minimal 5 days after fracture, TSP2-null mice had reduced expression of collagen IIa and Sox9 (chondrocyte differentiation markers) but increased expression of osteocalcin and osterix (osteoblast differentiation markers). Importantly, TSP2-null mice had a 2-fold increase in vessel density that corresponded with a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Glut-1 (markers of hypoxia inducible factor [HIF]-regulated transcription). Finally, by expressing TSP2 using adenovirus starting 3 days after fracture, chondrogenesis was restored in TSP2-null mice. We hypothesize that TSP2 expressed by cells in the fracture mesenchyme regulates callus vascularization. The increase in vascularity increases tissue oxemia and decreases HIF; thus, undifferentiated cells in the callus develop into osteoblasts rather than chondrocytes. This leads to an alternative strategy for achieving fracture healing with reduced endochondral ossification and enhanced appositional bone formation.

However, there is a paucity of information regarding the origin of plaque vasculature and the role of vasa vasorum in plaque growth. To inhibit growth of vasa vasorum in atherogenic mice and assess its effect on plaque growth, we used a truncated plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 protein, rPAI-1(23), that has significant antiangiogenic activity. Female LDLR(-/-)ApoB-48-deficient mice fed Paigen's diet without cholate for 20 weeks received rPAI-1(23) treatment (n=21) for the last 6 weeks. Plaque size and vasa vasorum density were compared to 2 controls: mice fed Paigen's diet and treated with saline for the last 6 weeks (n=16) and mice fed Paigen's diet until the onset of treatment (n=14). The rPAI-1(23) treatment significantly reduced plaque area and plaque cholesterol in the descending aorta and plaque area in the innominate artery. Measurements of reconstructed confocal microscopy images of vasa vasorum demonstrate that rPAI-1(23) treatment decreased vasa vasorum area and length, which was supported by microCT images. Confocal images provide evidence for vascularized plaque in the saline-treated group but not in rPAI-1(23)-treated mice. The increased vessel density in saline-treated mice is attributable, in part, to upregulated fibroblast growth factor-2 expression, which is inhibited by rPAI-1(23).

The introduction of endoscopic techniques and an endonasal approach to the ventral skull base has created new challenges for reconstruction. The nasoseptal flap has become the workhorse for vascularized endoscopic skull base reconstruction; however at times, the septal mucosal flap may be unavailable for reconstruction. This can be due to prior surgical resection or involvement of the nasal septum by sinonasal cancer. We have developed a minimally invasive endoscopic pericranial flap for endoscopic skull base reconstruction. The use of a pericranial scalp flap for reconstruction during endonasal skull base surgery using minimally invasive techniques has not been previously reported.\nWe performed cadaveric studies to illustrate feasibility of an endoscopic pericranial flap for endonasal skull base reconstruction, then applied this novel technique to an elderly patient after endonasal skull base and dural resection of an esthesioneuroblastoma.\nThe technical report of the minimally invasive pericranial flap is outlined and the advantages and limitations during endonasal skull base reconstruction are discussed. The patient had excellent healing of her skull base and had no evidence of any postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak.\nThe minimally invasive endoscopic pericranial flap provides another option for endonasal reconstruction of cranial base defects. There is minimal donor site morbidity, and it provides a large flap that can cover the entire ventral skull base.

{"title": "Self-organisation at the whole-plant level: a modelling study.", "abstract": "Within-plant light and nutrient environments are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The development of different parts of a plant is highly coordinated, which enables the efficient capture and use of resources in such heterogeneous environments. The physiological mechanisms underlying the correlative control of distantly located plant tissues and organs are still not fully understood. In this study, a mathematical model based on a self-organisation mechanism for resource allocation mediated by polar auxin transport is proposed to explain the origin of correlative effects among shoot branches. In the model, the shoot system of an individual plant is treated as a collection of relatively independent modular subunits competing for root-derived resources. The allocation of root-derived resources to different parts of the shoot is determined by their relative vascular contacts with the root system. The development of the vascular network is specified by the polar transport of auxin produced by various parts of the shoot in response to their immediate internal and external environments. The simulation results show that, by altering the amount of auxin they release individually in response to the local environment and modifying their relative vascular contact with the root system, subunits of a shoot are able to coordinate without a central controller and self-organise into functional and structural patterns such as light foraging and correlative dominance. This modelling study suggests that morphological dynamics at the whole-plant level can be understood as the sum of all modular responses to their local environments.

The fossils are permineralized in carbonate concretions and include tetrahedral seeds within cupule- or carpel-like structures. These enclosing structures, composed of elongate sclerenchyma cells with spiral thickenings that grade externally to a few layers of parenchyma, are vascularized by one collateral vascular bundle and lack trichomes. They apparently broke open to release the tightly enclosed seeds by valves. Seeds are similar to those of the Triassic seed fern Petriellaea, but are about 100 million years younger and differ in size, vascularization, integumentary anatomy, seed attachment, and number of seeds/cupule. These new seeds are described as Doylea tetrahedrasperma gen. et sp. nov., tentatively assigned to Corystospermales. Inverted cupules are reminiscent of an outer angiosperm integument rather than a carpel. Like fruits, cupules opened to release seeds at maturity, thereby foretelling several aspects of angiospermy. They show that nearly total ovule enclosure, a level of organization approaching angiospermy, was achieved by advanced seed ferns during the Mesozoic.", "journal": "American journal of botany", "date": "2009-01-01", "authors": ["Ruth AStockey", "Gar WRothwell"], "doi": "10.3732/ajb.0800295"}
{"title": "Acute Pancreatitis in the Postoperative Course after Esophagectomy: A Major Complication Described in 4 Patients.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative pancreatitis is a rare but devastating complication after esophageal surgery. It has been described in connection with abdominal surgery but the etiology in connection with esophageal surgery has never been evaluated. The present study describes 4 cases of postoperative pancreatitis, and a hypothesis about the etiology is formed. METHODS: We performed a search for patients with postoperative pancreatitis after esophagectomy using our prospective database including all patients that underwent esophageal resection at our institution between 1993 and 2008. Pancreatitis was described as abdominal pain, hyperamylasemia, signs of pancreatitis on CT scan or findings during laparotomy or autopsy. RESULTS: A total of 950 patients underwent esophagectomy at our institution, 4 patients developed postoperative pancreatitis (incidence 0.4%). Two out of four patients died. Discussion: Pancreatitis following esophageal surgery is a serious, potentially lethal complication. Diagnosis can be difficult as clear clinical or laboratory findings might be lacking. Peroperative manipulation of the pancreas, mobilization of the duodenum or compromized vascularization have been suggested as etiological factors; although in the described patients, none of these factors were identified as the cause of pancreatitis. In conclusion, pancreatitis following esophageal surgery is a serious but rare complication that should always be considered in patients who deteriorate postoperatively.", "journal": "Case reports in gastroenterology", "date": "2009-01-01", "authors": ["R L G MBlom", "Mvan Heijl", "O R CBusch", "M Ivan Berge Henegouwen"], "doi": "10.1159/000258092"}

When caused by moyamoya disease, ischemic or hemorrhagic episodes may complicate the management of high intracranial pressure. A 26-year-old Caucasian woman presented with generalized seizures and a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3 during the 36th week of pregnancy. The fetus was delivered by caesarean section. The brain CT in the mother revealed bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, a callosal hematoma, hydrocephalus and right frontal ischemia. Refractory high intracranial pressure developed and required bilateral ventricular drainage and intensive care treatment with barbiturates and hypothermia. Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography revealed a moyamoya syndrome with rupture of the abnormal collateral vascular network as the cause of the hemorrhage. Intracranial pressure could only be controlled after the surgical removal of the clots after a large opening of the right ventricle. Despite an initially low GCS, this patient made a good functional recovery at one year follow-up.

The dissection was performed after injection of the facial artery in 6 cases, while 4 muscles were dissected without any previous injection.\nThe vascular supply of the platysma muscle comes essentially from the branches of the submental artery and from branches descending straight from the facial artery. Other collateral branches contribute to this vascularization, but their importance is minor. All these arteries reach the muscle, entering its visceral aspect, then proceed to the sternal notch in a radial axis.\nThe size of the flap has to be defined within a quadrilateral figure with its base formed by the mandibular edge and its apex by the inferior limit of the flap. It is essential to preserve the maximum possible muscular thickness, especially on the medial side of the flap. If the facial artery needs to be ligated, this has to be done as it enters the submandibular space in order to protect most of the collateral branches destined to the muscle.

Next, the effect of VEGF on chondrogenesis within the synovial joint was tested, using genetically engineered MDSCs implanted into rat osteochondral defects. In this model, MDSCs transduced with a retroviral vector to express bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) were coimplanted with MDSCs transduced to express either VEGF or sFlt-1 (a VEGF antagonist) to provide a gain- and loss-of-function experimental design. Histologic scoring was used to compare cartilage formation among the treatment groups.\nHyaline-like cartilage matrix production was observed in both VEGF-treated and VEGF-blocked (sFlt-1-treated) pellet cultures, but quantitative PCR revealed that sFlt-1 treatment improved the expression of chondrogenic genes in MDSCs that were stimulated to undergo chondrogenic differentiation with BMP-4 and transforming growth factor beta3 (TGFbeta3).

In the present study, we used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model system to determine the role of insulin in the chemical signals regulating the processes of proliferation and viability (survival). MTT-based colorimetric methods demonstrated that insulin enhances proliferation and survival of HUVECs. Western blot analysis revealed that protein kinase B (pAkt [Thr(308)]) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were the insulin-responsive intermediates in proliferating endothelial cells (ECs). In insulin-enhanced survival, both pAkt (Thr(308)) and pAkt (Ser(473)) were activated in HUVECs. However, no change in VEGF expression accompanied pAkt activation. The beneficial effects of insulin were abrogated by insulin receptor (IR)/insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) or phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3-K) blockade, suggesting that insulin-induced EC proliferation and viability are mediated through pIR/pIGFR and PI3-K effectors.

During continuing maturation, pulmonary angiogenesis in premature infants would be a crucial process in lung development. A naturally occurring latent form of antithrombin (L-AT) has antiangiogenic effects on lung vascularization. However, impact of latent ATH (L-ATH) on developing lung vascularization is unknown. Thus, effects of L-AT and L-ATH on fetal murine lung development were compared. Lung buds from embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) Tie2-LacZ mouse embryos were incubated in DMEM plus FBS supplemented with PBS, AT, L-AT, heparin, ATH, or L-ATH. Vasculature of cultured explants was quantified by X-galactosidase staining. RNA was analyzed with murine gene probes for angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). FGF2-supplemented medium was used to test contribution to effects of L-AT and L-ATH on angiogenesis. Epithelial branching morphogenesis was inhibited by L-AT (P = 0.003) and heparin (P < 0.001). L-AT and heparin decreased relative vascular area compared with PBS, ATH, and L-ATH. Expressions of all genes studied were downregulated by L-AT. However, L-AT and L-ATH inhibited branching morphogenesis and vasculature with added FGF2.

This procedure is inspired by Cantwell Ransley procedure for epispadias repair and Snodgras procedure for hypospadias repair. The entire urethral plate was mobilized (i.e., lifted off the corpora) distal to the urethral meatus and was tubularized in two layers; inner urethral skin and outer spongiosal tissue, in Duplay fashion. The repair was reinforced with dartos vascularized flap. The skin incisions on the urethral strip are guided by the disposition of the spongiosal tissue underlying the urethral plate (rather than the conventional U-shaped incision on either side of hypospadiac urethral meatus). In the patients with proximal hypospadias with severe chordee urethral advancement was combined to achieve orthoplasty and a single stage hypospadias repair. The catheter was removed on tenth postoperative day.\nEven in patients with proximal hypospadias with severe chordee, good single staged repair was achieved without resorting to dorsal plication that would have been necessary had any other methods based on the preservation of urethral plate was performed in these subjects.

We first found that Wnt5a(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells exhibited a defect in endothelial differentiation, which was rescued by addition of Wnt5a, suggesting that Wnt5a is required for endothelial differentiation of ES cells. Involvement of both beta-catenin and protein kinase (PK)Calpha pathways in endothelial differentiation of mES cells requiring Wnt5a was indicated by activation of both beta-catenin and PKCalpha in Wnt5a(+/-) but not in Wnt5a(-/-) mES cells. We also found that beta-catenin or PKCalpha knockdowns inhibited the Wnt5a-induced endothelial differentiation of ES cells. Moreover, the lack of endothelial differentiation of Wnt5a(-/-) mES cells was rescued only by transfection of both beta-catenin and PKCalpha, indicating that both genes are required for Wnt5a-mediated endothelial differentiation. Wnt5a was also found to be essential for the differentiation of mES cells into immature endothelial progenitor cells, which are known to play a role in repair of damaged endothelium. Furthermore, a defect in the vascularization of the neural tissue was detected at embryonic day 14.5 in Wnt5a(-/-) mice, implicating Wnt5a in vascular development in vivo.

{"title": "Dynamic processes involved in the pre-vascularization of silk fibroin constructs for bone regeneration using outgrowth endothelial cells.", "abstract": "For successful bone regeneration tissue engineered bone constructs combining both aspects, namely a high osteogenic potential and a rapid connection to the vascular network are needed. In this study we assessed the formation of pre-vascular structures by human outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) from progenitors in the peripheral blood and the osteogenic differentiation of primary human osteoblasts (pOB) on micrometric silk fibroin scaffolds. The rational was to gain more insight into the dynamic processes involved in the differentiation and functionality of both cell types depending on culture time in vitro. Vascular tube formation by OEC was assessed quantitatively at one and 4 weeks of culture. In parallel, we assessed the temporal changes in cell ratios by flow cytometry and in the marker profiles of endothelial and osteogenic markers by quantitative real-time PCR. In terms of OEC, we observed an increase in tube length, tube area, number of nodes and number of vascular meshes within a culture period of 4 weeks, but a decrease in endothelial markers in real-time PCR. At the same time early osteogenic markers were downregulated, while marker expression associated with progressing mineralized matrix was upregulated in later stages of the culture. In addition, deposition of matrix components, such as collagen type I, known as a pro-angiogenic substrate for endothelial cells, appeared to increase with time indicated by immunohistochemistry. In summary, the study suggests a progressing maturation of the tissue construct with culture time which seems to be not effected by culture conditions mainly designed for outgrowth endothelial cells.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2008-12-19", "authors": ["SabineFuchs", "XinJiang", "HaraldSchmidt", "EvaDohle", "ShahramGhanaati", "CarinaOrth", "AlexanderHofmann", "AntonellaMotta", "ClaudioMigliaresi", "Charles JKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.028"}

FTWs (n = 55) were created on the backs of four pigs, covered with wound chambers, and randomly assigned to the following treatments: (1) APG, (2) APG + KCs, (3) APG + EPCs, (4) APG + KCs + EPCs, and (5) saline. All wounds were biopsied to measure neovascularization (lectin Bandeiraea Simplicifolia-1 (BS-1), alpha smooth muscle actin [alphaSMA], and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)), matrix deposition (fibronectin, collagen type I/III, and alphavbeta3), and reepithelialization. Wound fluids were analyzed for protein expression. All APG-treated wounds showed more vascular structures (p < 0.001), and the addition of EPCs further improved neovascularization, as confirmed by higher lectin, alphaSMA, and MT1-MMP. APG groups had higher collagen I/III (p < 0.05), alphavbeta3, and fibronectin content (p < 0.001), and they exhibited higher concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor subunit bb, basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin growth factor-1, transforming growth factor-beta1 and -beta3, matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -z9, and tissue-inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -2. Applying APG + KCs resulted in the highest reepithelialization rates (p < 0.001). No differences were found for wound contraction by planimetry.

{"title": "Targeting heat-shock protein 90 improves efficacy of rapamycin in a model of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains associated with a poor prognosis, but novel targeted therapies in combination with anti-angiogenic substances may offer new perspectives. We hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of tumor cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes would reduce growth and angiogenesis of HCC, which represents a highly vascularized tumor entity. Recently, because of their anti-angiogenic properties, inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have entered clinical trials for therapy of HCC. However, treatment with mTOR inhibitors may lead to paradoxical activation of Akt signaling in tumor cells via insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)-dependent and IGF-IR-independent mechanisms. Because we have recently identified heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) antagonists to impair both oncogenic and angiogenic signaling cascades in tumor cells, including Akt and IGF-IR, we sought to investigate whether Hsp90 blockade could improve growth-inhibitory and anti-angiogenic effects of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Human HCC cells, a murine hepatoma cell line, endothelial cells (ECs), and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were employed in experiments. Results show that dual inhibition of mTOR and Hsp90 leads to effective disruption of oncogenic signaling cascades and substantially improves growth-inhibitory effects in vivo. Importantly, blocking Hsp90 abrogated the rapamycin-induced activation of Akt and of the downstream effector nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) in HCC tumors. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibition reduced the expression of platelet-derived growth factor-receptor-beta (PDGF-Rbeta) on VSMCs, and diminished vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) expression on ECs, which further improves the anti-angiogenic capacity of this regimen.\nBlocking Hsp90 disrupts rapamycin-induced activation of alternative signaling pathways in HCCs and substantially improves the growth-inhibitory effects of mTOR inhibition in vivo. Hence, the concept of targeting tumor cells, ECs, and VSMCs by blocking Hsp90/mTOR could prove valuable for treatment of HCC.", "journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "date": "2008-12-17", "authors": ["Sven ALang", "ChristianMoser", "StefanFichnter-Feigl", "PhilippSchachtschneider", "ClausHellerbrand", "VolkerSchmitz", "Hans JSchlitt", "Edward KGeissler", "OliverStoeltzing"], "doi": "10.1002/hep.22685"}

In this study the effects of three different vascularization patterns on the vascular microstructure of a nerve segment in the rat based on the femoral artery and vein was investigated. Sixty adult male Wistar Albino rats were divided into five groups. In each group, a 1.5-cm segment of femoral nerve was transected at two sides, without disturbing the unity of the contents of the femoral sheath. The experimental design consisted of prefabricated venous nerve segment, venous nerve segment, arterial nerve segment, no blood flow, and controls groups. To assess the microstructure of the nerve segment, myelin and Schwann cell morphology and fibrosis were examined. There were many Schwann cells with near normal morphology in the venous nerve segment and arterial nerve segment groups.

Its anti-vascular activity is not based on direct cytotoxic effects, but is characterized by an immune-mediated component, through the activation of NF-kappaB pathway, and a direct anti-vascular action, involving the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis and changes in tumour vessel permeability. Despite promising pre-clinical results, DMXAA showed moderate anti-tumour activity in clinical trials. In this study, we compared to DMXAA the in vitro immune-modulating and the anti-vascular properties of two XAA analogues, AP/1649 and AP/1897. Their immune-stimulating activities were evaluated on a human monocyte cell line and their anti-vascular activities were studied by measuring the induction of HUVECs apoptosis and using DCE-MRI to determine tumour perfusion following drug treatment. Although the two molecules exerted an immune stimulation comparable to that produced by DMXAA, they showed reduced (AP/1649) or minimal (AP/1897) anti-vascular activity in vitro, and no anti-vascular effects in vivo.

Platelet activation can occur in the donor or recipient before transplantation as well as during antibody- and cell-mediated rejection. Biopsies taken during organ procurement from cadaver donors have documented that activated platelets are attached to vascular endothelial cells or leukocytes. In addition, many patients waiting for transplants have activated platelets due to the diseases that lead to organ failure or as a result of interventions used to support patients before and during transplantation. The contribution of platelets to hyperacute rejection of both allografts and xenografts is well recognized. Intravascular aggregates of platelets can also be prominent in experimental and clinical transplants that undergo acute antibody or cell-mediated rejection. In acute rejection, platelets can recruit mononuclear cells by secretion of chemokines. After contact, monocytes, macrophages and T cells interact with platelets through receptor/ligand pairs, including P-selectin/PSGL-1 and CD40/CD154. There is a potential for therapy to inhibit platelet mediated immune stimulation, but it is counterbalanced by the need to maintain coagulation in the perioperative period.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2008-12-11", "authors": ["A DKirk", "C NMorrell", "W MBaldwin"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02473.x"}
{"title": "Explicit separation of growth and motility in a new tumor cord model.", "abstract": "We investigate a new model of tumor growth in which cell motility is considered an explicitly separate process from growth. Bulk tumor expansion is modeled by individual cell motility in a density-dependent diffusion process. This model is implemented in the context of an in vivo system, the tumor cord. We investigate numerically microscale density distributions of different cell classes and macroscale whole tumor growth rates as functions of the strength of transitions between classes. Our results indicate that the total tumor growth follows a classical von Bertalanffy growth profile, as many in vivo tumors are observed to do. This provides a quick validation for the model hypotheses. The microscale and macroscale properties are both sensitive to fluctuations in the transition parameters, and grossly adopt one of two phenotypic profiles based on their parameter regime. We analyze these profiles and use the observations to classify parameter regimes by their phenotypes. This classification yields a novel hypothesis for the early evolutionary selection of the metastatic phenotype by selecting against less motile cells which grow to higher densities and may therefore induce local collapse of the vascular network.", "journal": "Bulletin of mathematical biology", "date": "2008-12-11", "authors": ["Craig JThalhauser", "TejasSankar", "Mark CPreul", "YangKuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11538-008-9372-8"}

However, current success rates are low due to progressive graft failure in the long term and inability to monitor graft development in vivo. Other limitations include the necessity of initial invasive surgery and continued immunosuppressive therapy. We report an alternative transplantation strategy with the potential to overcome these problems. This technique involves transplantation of embryonic pancreatic tissue into recipients' subcutaneous space, eliminating the need for invasive surgery and associated risks. Current results in mouse models of type 1 diabetes show that embryonic pancreatic transplants in the subcutaneous space can normalize blood glucose homeostasis and achieve extensive endocrine differentiation and vascularization. Furthermore, modern imaging techniques such as two-photon excitation microscopy (TPEM) can be employed to monitor transplants through the intact skin in a completely noninvasive manner. Thus, this strategy is a convenient alternative to islet transplantation in diabetic mice and has the potential to be translated to human clinical applications with appropriate modifications.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

While we have been successful in generating vascularized granulation-like tissue and adipose tissue in an in vivo tissue engineering chamber, production of other differentiated tissues in a stable construct remains a challenge. One approach is to utilize potent differentiation factors, which can influence the base tissue. Endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) have the ability to both carry differentiation factors and home to developing vasculature. In this study, proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate that such cells can be recruited from the circulation into an in vivo tissue engineering chamber. CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)/stromal cell-derived factor 1 was infused into the chamber through Alzet osmotic pumps and chamber cannulation between days 0 and 7, and facilitated recruitment of systemically inoculated exogenous human EPCs injected on day 6.

{"title": "Prevention of skin flap necrosis by estradiol involves reperfusion of a protected vascular network.", "abstract": "Although 17beta-estradiol (E2) is protective in experimental models of myocardial and brain ischemia, its effect on skin ischemia remains unknown. Here, we assessed the protective effect of E2 in a mouse model of skin ischemia, mimicking the surgery of skin flaps. Whereas necrosis appeared in the half portion of the skin flap within 1 week after surgery in ovariectomized mice, it was reduced up to 10-fold when mice were pretreated with E2, at least 3 days before the surgery. The beneficial effect of E2 appeared to be attributable to an increase in skin survival, revealed by measuring viability of ex vivo explants and enhancement of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression in vivo. This protective effect on the skin contributed to the protection of the vascular network and facilitated reperfusion, which was found to be accelerated in ovariectomized E2-treated mice, whereas hemorrhages were observed in untreated mice. E2 also increased expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 isoforms in the skin and circulating vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum. Finally, this protective effect of E2 was abolished in estrogen receptor-deficient mice (ERalpha(-/-)) but maintained in chimeric mice reconstituted with ERalpha-deficient bone marrow, indicating dispensable action of E2 in bone marrow-derived cells. This protective effect of E2 was mimicked by treatment with tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that E2 exerts a major preventive effect of skin flap necrosis through a prevention of ischemic-induced skin lesions, including those of the vascular network, which contributes to accelerate the reperfusion of the skin flap.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2008-12-09", "authors": ["C\u00e9line EToutain", "LaurentBrouchet", "IsabelleRaymond-Letron", "PatriciaVicendo", "HortenseBerg\u00e8s", "JulieFavre", "Marie-Jos\u00e9Fouque", "Andr\u00e9eKrust", "Anne-MarieSchmitt", "PierreChambon", "PierreGourdy", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisArnal", "Fran\u00e7oiseLenfant"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182410"}

Our supposition is that the timed delivery of an anti-angiogenic factor in cartilage tissue engineering may facilitate the formation of hyaline cartilage by inducing the regression of vascularization. To this end our overall goal is to prepare an off-the-shelf scaffold containing the gene for a potent anti-angiogenic factor. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of a type I/III collagen scaffold for the non-viral transfection of marrow stromal cells (MSCs, also referred to as mesenchymal stem cells) with the plasmid encoding endostatin. Caprine MSCs were transfected by the naked plasmid alone and plasmid incorporated into a cationic lipid complex in three experiments: 1) cells were transfected in monolayer; 2) monolayer-transfected cells were grown in a collagen sponge-like scaffold; and 3) non-transfected cells were grown in a collagen scaffold containing the naked plasmid and endostatin lipoplex. Independent variables were the passage number of the cells and the plasmid loading. The amount of endostatin released by the cells into the medium was measured using an ELISA. The results demonstrated the overexpression of endostatin by MSCs growing in the endostatin lipoplex-supplemented collagen scaffolds. Endostatin released by the cell-seeded scaffolds reached a peak of 13ng/ml for scaffolds incorporating as little as 20mug of plasmid, at the 3-day collection period ending 5 days post-seeding. The accumulated endostatin synthesis over a 2-week period began to achieve what may be a therapeutic level.

Here we report that the notochord suppresses the generation of ECs from the mesoderm both in vivo and in vitro. We also report that the notochord diminishes the ability of mature ECs to organize into a primitive plexus. Furthermore, Noggin mimics notochord-based inhibition by preventing mesodermal EC generation and mature EC network formation.

HUVEC can be induced to form sprouts and longer processes with lumens, in co-culture with glioma cells that secrete VEGF. Addition of exogenous VEGF enhances this effect. In the absence of glioma cells, many single HUVEC migrate away from the beads, without significant tubule formation. Hypoxia further stimulated sprout formation by 50-100%. Anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody suppressed HUVEC sprouting by 75% in co-culture with glioma cells. This 3-D in vitro co-culture system provides a robust and useful model for analysis of the major steps of glioma-induced angiogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2008-11-29", "authors": ["ZhijianChen", "AndreHtay", "WagnerDos Santos", "George TGillies", "Helen LFillmore", "Milton MSholley", "William CBroaddus"], "doi": "10.1007/s11060-008-9742-y"}
{"title": "The downmodulation of the foreign body reaction by cytomegalovirus encoded interleukin-10.", "abstract": "The foreign body reaction (FBR) is of great importance for the function and turnover of biomaterial scaffolds. The development of biological tools that modulate the FBR will augment scaffold functionality and benefit regenerative medicine. The human cytomegalovirus encodes a functional homolog of the potent anti-inflammatory human cytokine interleukin-10 (cmvIL-10). We hypothesized that cmvIL-10 downmodulates the FBR, impairing degradation of biomaterial. We studied the effect of cmvIL-10 on the FBR to subcutaneously implanted hexamethylenediisocyanate-crosslinked dermal sheep collagen (HDSC) discs in rats. CmvIL-10 impaired macrophage influx, vascularization and ingrowth into the discs up to 21 days. It also impaired the formation of giant cells and the degradation of HDSC. At day 10, deposited fibrin fibers were still present in cmvIL-10 discs. Impaired collagenase activity coincided with the impaired HDSC degradation. These results indicate that cmvIL-10 downmodulates the FBR, impairing the progression of the FBR.

In an attempt to resolve this problem, 15 patients with fingertip injuries involving palmar skin defects or amputation were treated with a vascularized flap transfer from the midpalmar area. A 2.5 x 1.5 to 4.5 x 2 cm flap from the radial or distal aspect of the midpalm, pedicled on the terminal branch of the superficial palmar arch or common/proper palmar digital artery and vein, was transferred in a retrograde fashion to cover the skin and soft tissue defects of the finger. All the flaps survived without complications. Moving two-point discrimination in the flap averaged 6 mm in patients who underwent sensory flap transfer.

Because the ankle is a weightbearing joint, the affected ankle tends to become damaged. Consequently, the surgical procedure of arthrodesis is necessary, which usually proves effective. We report two cases of ankle tuberculosis, in patients 53 and 71 years of age. The former case had been diagnosed initially as osteoarthritis and then later as pyogenic osteomyelitis; the latter case had been diagnosed as pigmented villonodular synovitis, a benign but aggressive lesion that involves the joints. In addition to antitubercular medicine, these cases were treated with debridement for necrotic tissue and arthrodesis. In the former case, an iliac osteocutaneous flap was performed, and arthrodesis between the tibia, talus, and calcaneus was obtained. In the other case, a vascularized iliac bone graft was performed that resulted in arthrodesis between the tarsal bones, talus, and calcaneus but with pseudoarthrosis between the tibia and the talus. Settlement of the joint tuberculosis and gait ability without resorption or corruption of the grafted bone was obtained in both cases.

This graft is vascularized by the descending genicular artery (DGA). In patients with femur nonunion, pedicled vascularized bone grafts are usable in some cases. To confirm the applicable range of this graft, we performed dissection of the DGAs in 16 lower limbs of eight embalmed cadavers. A pedicled bone graft from the supracondylar region of the femur was harvested and rotated proximally to the femur as far as possible. The distance from the apex of the medial epicondyle to the central point of the transferred bone (DMEB) was measured. DMEBs ranged from 13.0 to 20.0 cm (mean, 17.3). Dividing the DMEB by femoral length we defined as the transposition ratio. Transposition ratios ranged from 0.48 to 0.70 (mean, 0.60).

Three weeks after an external irradiation of the hind limbs of rats, four bone defects were created per animal. The defects were filled with either BCP alone, or with a mixture of BCP and TBM, or with a mixture of BCP and MSCs (adipose-derived or bone marrow-derived MSCs). Three weeks after implantations, new-bone formation was assessed. Histological examination showed osteoconductive and osteointegrative properties of BCP in irradiated tissue. The BCP-TBM mixture significantly improved bone ingrowth (p<0.05). The BCP-MSCs mixtures did not provide new-bone formation over and above that induced by BCP alone. This gives grounds for suspecting that there is a link between this result and the cellular and vascular weakness observed in irradiated bone. The BCP-TBM mixture may have induced an increased vascularization of irradiated bone. This could be due to the presence of all components in TBM that were lacking in the BCP-MSCs mixtures.

The present study characterized the subpleural pulmonary microvascular architecture of newborn yak by vascular corrosion cast and the scanning electron microscopy. The results showed the dense vascular network occurred in subpleural area in newborn yak. Subpleural vascular network was found in most of observed areas, while the sparse vascular network crept onto the subpleural network in some fields of view. The subpleural microvessels and their branches made up of the subpleural microvascular network. According to the branching sequence of vessels, the subpleural arterioles could be divided into four grades: the arteriole, terminal arteriole, precapillary arteriole and capillary. The subpleural capillary network in the local area could be classified into three different forms, including sheetlike vascular network, wrinkled vascular network and weblike vascular network. It was the specific characteristics on the cast surface of the microvessels that was the adaptable peculiarities. Anastomoses were found between the pleural microvessels and the interlobular capillaries, or between the pleural microvessels and the subpleural capillaries, or between the interlobular capillaries and the subpleural capillaries.

When rat BMSCs were seeded onto a three-dimensional (3-D) tubular scaffold engineered from topographically aligned type I collagen fibers and cultured either in vasculogenic or non-vasculogenic media for 7, 14, 21 or 28 days, the maturation and co-differentiation into endothelial and/or smooth muscle cell lineages were observed. Phenotypic induction of these substrate-grown cells was assayed at transcript level by real-time PCR and at protein level by confocal microscopy. In the present study, the observed upregulation of transcripts coding for vascular phenotypic markers is reminiscent of an in vivo expression pattern. Immunolocalization of vasculogenic lineage-associated markers revealed typical expression patterns of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. These endothelial cells exhibited high metabolism of acetylated low-density lipoprotein. In addition to the induced monolayers of endothelial cells, the presence of numerous microvascular capillary-like structures was observed throughout the construct. At the level of scanning electron microscopy, smooth-walled cylindrical tube-like structures with smooth muscle cells and/or pericytes attached to its surface were elucidated. Our 3-D culture system not only induces the maturation and differentiation of BMSCs into vascular cell lineages but also supports microvessel morphogenesis.

For this, viability is maintained by repair of nutrient vessels and neovascularization from implanted host-derived vasculature. Microsurgically revascularized femoral diaphysis allotransplants were transferred from young male New-Zealand-White (NZW) into 4 groups of male Dutch-Belted (DB) rabbits. Short-term immunosuppression by tacrolimus (IS, groups 4 and 5) and host-derived neovascularization (NV) from implanted fascial flaps was used to maintain viability (groups 3 and 5) as independent variables. Group 2 received neither IS nor NV. Vascularized pedicled autotransplants were orthotopically transplanted in group 1. After 16 weeks, transplants were evaluated using radiologic, histologic, biomechanical, and histomorphometric parameters. Vascularized bone allotransplants treated with both short-term IS and host-derived NV (group 5) healed in a fashion similar to pedicled autotransplants (group 1). Their radiographic scores were higher than other groups. Groups with patent fascial flaps (3 and 5) showed significantly greater neoangiogenesis than ligated controls (2 and 4). Tacrolimus administration did not affect neoangiogenesis. Elastic modulus and ultimate stress were significantly greater in autogenous bone than in allotransplanted femora. Biomechanical properties were not significantly different among allotransplants. Bone turnover was decreased with IS, but increased with NV by the implanted fascial flaps.

We examined whether oxygen generating biomaterials are able to maintain cell viability while also maintaining structural integrity of a 3-D construct. Calcium peroxide-based oxygen generating particles were incorporated into 3-D scaffolds of Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The scaffolds were designed to generate oxygen over the course of 10 days and simultaneously maintain sufficient mechanical integrity. Scaffolds containing oxygen generating materials maintained elevated levels of oxygen when incubated under hypoxic conditions. Further, these biomaterials were able to extend cell viability growth under hypoxic conditions.

The ON incidence in the H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (p<0.05). A significant decrease in the vascularization index and a significant increase in the permeability index seen in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. Reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units was more rarely found in the H-ICT group than in the L-ICT group. Regarding intravascular thrombosis, a significant increase in the thrombotic vessel count, endothelium injury index, coagulation index, and a significant decrease in both the fibrinolysis and oxidative stress index in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. For extravascular lipid-deposition, a significant increase in the fat cell area fraction, adipogenic potential index, PPARgamma expression and lipid-transportation index in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group.

ECs switch between growth, differentiation, motility, or apoptotic behavior in response to the local topology and composition of the ECM. Assuming the ECM medium as a statistically inhomogeneous medium (some area support sprout growth, some not), we show that the ECM can be a natural barrier to angiogenesis. We study vascular network formation for several ECM distributions and topologies, and we find an analogy with percolation. A threshold exists, under which sprouts cannot reach the tumor. During the growth of the vascular network, a competition exists between the attraction exerted by tumor and the preferred path created by the ECM. We also examined the influence of branching on the tumor vascularization. Branching is a natural phenomenon which helps the tumor become vascularized. By increasing the number of sprouts, the vascular network increases the probability of reaching the tumor, as it can explore more pathways. Our simulations show after two branching events, the vascular network is very likely to reach the tumor.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2008-11-18", "authors": ["FranckAmyot", "AlexSmall", "Hac\u00e8neBoukari", "KevinCamphausen", "AmirGandjbakhche"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2007.11.001"}

Ten hearts of adult healthy Bactrian camels of different sex constituted the material. Following exposition of the arteries by means of injection of 15% ABS coloured with red carmine to a. coronaria sinistra and a. coronaria dextra, dissection was performed. The arterial vascularization of the heart in Bactrian camels was determined to be supplied by a. coronaria sinistra and a. coronaria dextra which originate from the aorta. The results showed that ramus interventricularis subsinuosus is one branch of a. coronaria dextra in Bactrian camels, which is characteristic of a. coronaria dextra pattern. Ramus septi interventricularis that supplied the interventricular septum mainly originates from ramus interventricular paraconalis. Two muscular bridges ware observed crossing ramus interventricular paraconalis in the middle third of sulcus interventricularis paraconalis.

{"title": "A mechanobiological model for tissue differentiation that includes angiogenesis: a lattice-based modeling approach.", "abstract": "Mechanobiological models have previously been used to predict the time course of the tissue differentiation process, with the local mechanical environment as the regulator of cell activity. However, since the supply of oxygen and nutrients to cells is also a regulator of cell differentiation and oxygen diffusion is limited to few hundred micrometers from capillaries, the morphology of the new vascular network may also play a critical role in the process. In this paper, a computational model for tissue differentiation based on the local mechanical environment and the local vascularity is presented. A regular lattice is used to simulate cell activity (migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis). The algorithm for capillary network formation includes mechanoregulation of vessel growth. A simulation of tissue differentiation in a bone/implant gap under shear was performed. The model predicts capillary networks similar to those found in experimental studies and heterogeneous patterns of tissue differentiation, which are influenced by the morphology of the capillary network. Higher mechanical loads caused slower vascular development and delayed bone tissue formations.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2008-11-18", "authors": ["SaraCheca", "Patrick JPrendergast"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-008-9594-9"}

Results showed that the laser irradiation had had a positive photobiomodulation effect on inflammation, confirmed by a better histologic pattern than that of the control group at 3 days and 7 days. Semiquantitative analysis revealed that groups A and B had a histologic score significantly greater than that of the control group at 3 days. At 21 days, histomorphometric analysis revealed a more intense inflammation in the red laser group than in the other groups.

We have developed a novel approach to overcome these obstacles using autologous explanted microcirculatory beds (EMBs) as bioscaffolds for engineering complex three-dimensional constructs. In this study, EMBs consisting of an afferent artery, capillary beds, efferent vein, and surrounding parenchymal tissue are explanted and maintained for 24 h ex vivo in a bioreactor that preserves EMB viability and function. Given the rapidly advancing field of stem cell biology, EMBs were subsequently seeded with three distinct stem cell populations, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), and bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We demonstrate MAPCs, as well as MSCs, are able to egress from the microcirculation into the parenchymal space, forming proliferative clusters. Likewise, human adipose tissue-derived MSCs were also found to egress from the vasculature and seed into the EMBs, suggesting feasibility of this technology for clinical applications. We further demonstrate that MSCs can be transfected to express a luciferase protein and continue to remain viable and maintain luciferase expression in vivo. By using the vascular network of EMBs, EMBs can be perfused ex vivo and seeded with stem cells, which can potentially be directed to differentiate into neo-organs or transfected to replace failing organs and deficient proteins.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2008-11-13", "authors": ["Edward IChang", "Robert GBonillas", "SamyraEl-ftesi", "Eric IChang", "Daniel JCeradini", "Ivan NVial", "Denise AChan", "JosephMichaels", "Geoffrey CGurtner"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.08-114868"}

In serum-shocked cells we found circadian expressions for the clock genes Per2 and Dec1 as well as for Dbp, a canonical clock-controlled gene. We obtained similar results for Vegf, a circadian output involved in the control of placental vasculogenesis and trophoblast functions. Interestingly, circadian oscillations persisted and even enhanced in cells experimentally rendered hypoxic with CoCl(2). These results could be explained since the hypoxic milieu of the first-trimester placenta is considered the optimal condition for normal placentation.

Efficacy of these elements was tested in multiple tumor cell lines, both in cell culture and as tumor explants in athymic nude mice. Plasmid and viral vectors were constructed with the AChP promoter alone or in fusion with three copies of the ACE66 enhancer for expression of the prototype suicide gene, thymidine kinase (TK). ACE/AChP and AChP cassettes elicited ganciclovir (GCV)-induced cytotoxicity in multiple tumor cell lines.

An adenovirus containing the AChP-TK cassette produced striking increases in GCV sensitivity in cultured tumor cell lines, as well as GCV-induced regression of U87 MG glioblastoma explants in vivo. TK expression was distributed throughout tumors receiving the therapeutic virus, whereas TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis revealed numerous regions undergoing apoptosis. Vascularization and reticulin fiber networks were less pronounced in virus-GCV-treated tumors, suggesting that both primary and stromal cell types may have been targeted.

Angiogenesis, microhemodynamics, and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction were analyzed repetitively after implantation in the center and in the border zone of the implant up to 15 days. Both NanoBone granules and plates exhibited high biocompatibility comparable to that of cancellous bone, as indicated by a lack of venular leukocyte activation after implantation. In both synthetic NanoBone groups, signs of angiogenesis could be observed even at day 5 after implantation, whereas granules showed higher functional vessel density compared with NanoBone plates. The angiogenic response of the cancellous bone was markedly accelerated in the center of the implant tissue. Histologically, implant tissue showed an ingrowth of vascularized fibrous tissue into the material combined with an increased number of foreign-body giant cells. In conclusion, NanoBone, particularly in granular form, showed high biocompatibility and high angiogenic response, thus improving the healing of bone defects.

Double immunofluorescent stainings of the vasculature with anti- alpha-smooth muscle actin antibody were performed in order to assess the maturity of mucosal vessels.

In patients on a gluten-free diet, the vasculature normalized parallel to mucosal recovery.\nIn coeliac disease, ingestion of gluten leads to altered appearance of small-bowel mucosal microvasculature.

This review aims at introducing the concept of adult vasculogenesis and discusses the efforts to identify and characterize adult endothelial progenitors. The different sources of adult endothelial progenitors like haematopoietic stem cells, myeloid cells, multipotent progenitors of the bone marrow, side population cells and tissue-residing pluripotent stem cells are considered.

OEC cultured on starch polycaprolactone fiber meshes (SPCL) in monoculture retained their endothelial functionality and responded to angiogenic stimulation by VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in fibrin gel-assays in vitro. Co-culture of OEC with human primary osteoblasts (pOB) on SPCL, induced an angiogenic activation of OEC towards microvessel-like structures achieved without additional supplementation with angiogenic growth factors. Effects of co-cultures with pOB on the vascularization process by OEC in vivo were tested by subcutaneous implantation of Matrigel plugs containing both, OEC and pOB, and resulted in OEC-derived blood vessels integrated into the host tissue and anastomosed to the vascular supply. In addition, morphometric analysis of the vascularization process by OEC indicated a better performance of OEC in the co-cultures with primary osteoblasts compared to monocultures of OEC. The contribution of OEC to vascular structures and the beneficial effect of the co-culture with primary human osteoblasts on the vascularization in vivo was additionally proven by subcutaneous implantation of pre-cellularized and pre-cultured SPCL constructs. OEC contributed to the vascular structures, by generating autogenic vessels or by incorporation into chimeric vessels consisting of both, human and mouse endothelial cells.

Using point-injection and low-pressure techniques, seeded endothelial cells and osteoblasts were able to assemble into microvascular networks and form bony matrix in grafts. The exogenous origination of these cells and their contribution to the vascularization and osteogenesis was confirmed using sex-mismatch implantation and Y chromosome tracking. By pre-seeding with endothelial cells, the resulting vascularization was able to promote osteogenesis, prevent ischemic necrosis and improve the mechanical properties in engineered bone tissue. Taken together, the results indicated that the integration of complex cell populations with composite scaffold materials provided an effective technique to improve osteogenesis in engineered bone graft. These findings suggest that hybrid grafts have great potential for clinical use to treat large bone defects.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2008-11-01", "authors": ["HaiyingYu", "Pamela JVandeVord", "LiMao", "Howard WMatthew", "Paul HWooley", "Shang-YouYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.047"}
{"title": "Novel factor-loaded polyphosphazene matrices: potential for driving angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Currently employed bone tissue engineered scaffolds often lack the potential for vascularization, which may be enhanced through the incorporation of and regulated release of angiogenic factors. For this reason, the objective here was to fabricate and characterize protein-loaded amino acid ester polyphosphazene (Pphos)-based scaffolds and evaluate the novel sintering method used for protein incorporation, a method which will ultimately allow for the incorporation of proangiogenic agents. To test the hypothesis, Pphos and their composite microspheres with nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (Pphos-HAp) were fabricated via the emulsion solvent evaporation method. Next, bovine serum albumin (BSA)-containing microsphere matrices were created using a novel solvent-non-solvent approach for protein loading. The resulting protein (BSA) loaded circular porous microsphere based scaffolds were characterized for morphology, porosity, protein structure, protein distribution and subsequent protein release pattern. Scanning electron microscopy revealed porous microsphere scaffolds with a smooth surface and sufficient level of sintering, illustrated by fusion of adjacent microspheres. The porosity measured for the poly(ethyl phenylalanato:glycinato)phosphazene (PNPhGly) and poly(ethyl phenylalanato:glycinato)phosphazene-hydroxyapatite (PNPhGly-HAp) scaffolds were 23 +/- 0.11% and 18 +/- 4.02%, respectively, and within the range of trabecular bone. Circular dichroism confirmed an intact secondary protein structure for BSA following the solvent sintering method used for loading and confocal microscopy verified that FITC-BSA was successfully entrapped both between adjacent microspheres and within the surface of the microspheres while sintering. For both Pphos and their composite microsphere scaffolds, BSA was released at a steady rate over a 21 day time period, following a zero order release profile. HAp particles in the composite scaffolds served to improve the release profile pattern, underscoring the potential of HAp for growth factor delivery. Moreover, the results of this work suggest that the solvent-non-solvent technique for protein loading is an optimal one that will allow for future development of angiogenic factor-loaded Pphos matrices with the capacity to invoke neovascularization.", "journal": "Journal of microencapsulation", "date": "2008-10-31", "authors": ["OlugbemisolaOredein-McCoy", "Nicholas RKrogman", "Arlin LWeikel", "Mark DHindenlang", "Harry RAllcock", "Cato TLaurencin"], "doi": "10.1080/02652040802500473"}

Such changes may enhance the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons and the risk of developing PD, and may be reduced by exercise.

{"title": "Histological and immunohistochemical characterization of equine anovulatory haemorrhagic follicles (AHFs).", "abstract": "Anovulatory haemorrhagic follicles (AHFs) are often the reason for ovulation failure in the mare. As the underlying factors that lead to AHF development are not well understood, it was of interest to investigate the vascularization of AHFs compared with normal follicles and corpora lutea (controls). In the present study, the ovarian cell populations investigated immunohistochemically included granulosa and luteal cells as well as various vascular structures. None of these cell types showed differences in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) between control ovaries containing normal follicles and corpora lutea and ovaries with AHFs. In contrast, a considerable reduction in the proportion of Flk-1-expressing cells, together with a decreased intensity of staining, was apparent in the AHFs. This greatly reduced expression of Flk-1 in the luteinized cells and the vascular structures of AHFs may lead to a distinct decrease in the potential pro-angiogenic activity of VEGF-A in these structures compared with the situation in normal follicles and corpora lutea. Furthermore, the authors suspect that the distinct expression of angiopoietin2 and VEGF-A seen in the cells within the inner fibrous layers of the AHFs was caused by hypoxia resulting from deficient vascularization, as suggested by the irregularity of the capillaries present in the luteinized wall of the AHF. In addition, whereas LH-receptor (LH-R) expression occurred uniformly in all stages of development of the corpora lutea in normal control ovaries, there was highly variable labelling for LH-R in all the AHFs examined, thereby indicating a possible numerical deficiency of LH-receptors in AHFs. The authors concluded that, despite the apparent expression of sufficient VEGF-A in the AHFs allows ovulation and corpus luteum formation, a relative lack of receptor, Flk-1, effects the pro-angiogenic activity of VEGF-A which could be a reason for ovulation failure associated with AHF formation.", "journal": "Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene", "date": "2008-10-29", "authors": ["CEllenberger", "KM\u00fcller", "H-ASchoon", "SWilsher", "W RAllen"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01085.x"}

{"title": "Emerging pulmonary vasculature lacks fate specification.", "abstract": "Lung morphogenesis requires precise coordination between branching morphogenesis and vascularization to generate distal airways capable of supporting respiration at the cell-cell interface. The specific origins and types of blood vessels that initially form in the lung, however, remain obscure. Herein, we definitively show that during the early phases of lung development [i.e., embryonic day (E) 11.5], functional vessels, replete with blood flow, are restricted to the mesenchyme, distal to the epithelium. However, by day E14.5, and in response to epithelial-derived VEGF signals, functional vessels extend from the mesenchyme to the epithelial interface. Moreover, these vessels reside adjacent to multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells that likely play a regulatory role in this process. As well as and distinct from the systemic vasculature, immunostaining for EphrinB2 and EphB4 revealed that arterial and venous identity is not distinguishable in emergent pulmonary vasculature. Collectively, this study provides evidence that lung vascularization initially originates in the mesenchyme, distal to the epithelium, and that arterial-venous specification does not exist in the early lung. At a mechanistic level, we show that basilar epithelial VEGF prompts endothelial cells to move toward the epithelium where they undergo morphogenesis during the proliferative, canalicular stage. Thus our findings challenge existing notions of vascular origin and identity during development.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Recently, several integrated bioengineering strategies have been applied to improve bioengineered adipose tissue grafts, including internalized microchannels, delivery of angiogenic growth factors, tailored biomaterials and transplantation of precursor cells with continuing differentiation potential.

{"title": "Anatomy of the subcutaneous lymph vascular network of the human leg in relation to the great saphenous vein.", "abstract": "The anatomical relationship between lymphatic collectors and veins is of clinical importance for preventing lymphedema secondary to lymphatic collector injury during surgical procedures. To identify areas at risk during surgical interventions, we performed an anatomical study of human legs. The lymphatic collectors of 42 legs of human cadavers were injected with Berlin Blue solution or contrast medium. After fixation, the collectors were dissected and their distances from the great saphenous vein were determined. We found that the lymphatic collectors on the dorsum of the foot ran in close parallel with the corium, whereas in the groin a greater number of lymphatic collectors clustered around the great saphenous vein. The ventromedial bundle that drains into the superficial inguinal nodes included 5-20 lymphatic collectors. The average width of the ventromedial bundle varied between 116 mm at the middle of the lower leg and 32 mm at the groin. Our study cannot confirm the previous observation of a bottleneck of the ventromedial bundle occurring at the knee, but does support the finding of an elongated bottleneck at the thigh and groin draining into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. In addition, the idea of one sentinel lymph node for a specific region of the leg is not supported by these data. These observations will help surgeons to plan incisions and dissections with respect to lymphatic collectors, thereby minimizing damage to them and reducing complications resulting from unnecessary lymphatic excisions.

{"title": "Anesthesia for free vascularized tissue transfer.", "abstract": "Anesthesia may be an important factor in maximizing the success of microsurgery by controlling the hemodynamics and the regional blood flow. The intraanesthetic basic goal is to maintain an optimal blood flow for the vascularized free flap by: increasing the circulatory blood flow, maintaining a normal body temperature to avoid peripheral vasoconstriction, reducing vasoconstriction resulted from pain, anxiety, hyperventilation, or some drugs, treating hypotension caused by extensive sympathetic block and low cardiac output. A hyperdynamic circulation can be obtained by hypervolemic or normovolemic hemodilution and by decrease of systemic vascular resistance. The importance of proper volume replacement has been widely accepted, but the optimal strategy is still open to debate. General anesthesia combined with various types of regional anesthesia is largely preferred for microvascular surgery. Maintenance of homeostasis through avoidance of hyperoxia, hypocapnia, and hypovolemia (all factors that can decrease cardiac output and induce local vasoconstriction) is a well-established perioperative goal. As the ischemia-reperfusion injury could occur, inhalatory anesthetics as sevoflurane (that attenuate the consequences of this process) seem to be the anesthetics of choice.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2008-10-24", "authors": ["NataliaHagau", "DanLongrois"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.20584"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues.", "abstract": "Vascular development and homeostasis are underpinned by two fundamental features: the generation of new vessels to meet the metabolic demands of under-perfused regions and the elimination of vessels that do not sustain flow. In this paper we develop the first multiscale model of vascular tissue growth that combines blood flow, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling and the subcellular and tissue scale dynamics of multiple cell populations. Simulations show that vessel pruning, due to low wall shear stress, is highly sensitive to the pressure drop across a vascular network, the degree of pruning increasing as the pressure drop increases. In the model, low tissue oxygen levels alter the internal dynamics of normal cells, causing them to release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates angiogenic sprouting. Consequently, the level of blood oxygenation regulates the extent of angiogenesis, with higher oxygenation leading to fewer vessels. Simulations show that network remodelling (and de novo network formation) is best achieved via an appropriate balance between pruning and angiogenesis. An important factor is the strength of endothelial tip cell chemotaxis in response to VEGF. When a cluster of tumour cells is introduced into normal tissue, as the tumour grows hypoxic regions form, producing high levels of VEGF that stimulate angiogenesis and cause the vascular density to exceed that for normal tissue. If the original vessel network is sufficiently sparse then the tumour may remain localised near its parent vessel until new vessels bridge the gap to an adjacent vessel. This can lead to metastable periods, during which the tumour burden is approximately constant, followed by periods of rapid growth.", "journal": "Journal of mathematical biology", "date": "2008-10-23", "authors": ["Markus ROwen", "Tom\u00e1sAlarc\u00f3n", "Philip KMaini", "Helen MByrne"], "doi": "10.1007/s00285-008-0213-z"}

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, immunofluorescence and ELISA analyzes were used to investigate the expression of angiogenin in human DPCs, while semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to assess angiogenin mRNA expression in murine skin phased at different stages of the hair cycle. We detected angiogenin expression in DPCs, where it was found to be localized to the cytoplasm. Angiogenin mRNA was expressed in murine skin in a hair-cycle dependent manner, with maximum levels observed at the late anagen. Local injection of angiogenin promoted skin angiogenesis and induced anagen VI. In vitro studies showed that angiogenin significantly enhanced the elongation of hair follicles, and stimulated DPCs and ORS keratinocytes to proliferate.

We modulated cortactin expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. Cortactin expression levels directly correlated with tumor size, vascularization and cell proliferation in an orthotopic HNSCC in vivo model. In contrast, under normal in vitro culture conditions, cortactin expression levels had no effect on cell proliferation. However, cell lines in which cortactin expression was reduced by knockdown (KD) grew poorly in vitro under harsh conditions of growth factor deprivation, anchorage independence and space constraint. In contrast, overexpression of cortactin enhanced in vitro growth under the same harsh conditions. Surprisingly, defects in growth factor-independent proliferation of cortactin-KD cells were rescued by coculture with cortactin-expressing cells. As the cocultured cells are separated by permeable filters, cortactin-expressing cells must secrete growth-supporting autocrine factors to rescue the cortactin-KD cells.

This correlated with the differential expressions of various factors at mRNA/antigen level and with increased endothelial flt1, KDR, MT2- and MT5-MMP expression in miscarriage patients. The differences between cases and controls were probably not based on altered proliferation and/or apoptosis, since Ki67 and active Caspase-3 showed comparable expression levels in both groups.

To be used for reconstruction of tissue defects, engineered grafts need to be axially vascularized to enable transplantation without graft loss due to hypoxia. Limitations to dimensions in small animal models had not yet been overcome, which is necessary to yield clinical relevance. Anatomical studies of groin and axillary regions in eight merino sheep were followed by microsurgical creation of an arteriovenous loop (AV-loop), embedded in an isolation chamber filled with fibrin matrix. Constructs were implanted in the groin of six sheep for up to 6 weeks. Course of vascularization in de novo forming tissue was assessed by sequential computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in vivo, as well as by postexplantational micro-computed tomography and histology. A vascular axis was constantly found epifascially at the medial aspect of all sheep's thighs, which was used for AV-loop creation. Patency of AV-loop could be visualized by CTA and MRA scans during 1-6 weeks. Complex 3D-vessel-reconstruction revealed increasing axial vascularization of the fibrin matrix and growing connective tissue within the isolation chamber, which was confirmed by micro-computed tomography and histology postexplantation.

They were originally isolated from bone marrow, but MSC-like cells have also been isolated from other tissues. The common feature of all of these tissues is that they all house blood vessels. It is, thus, possible that MSCs are associated with perivascular locations. The objective of this work was to test the hypothesis that MSCs are associated with blood vessels by verifying if MSC frequency positively correlates with blood vessel density. To this end, samples from highly and poorly vascularized adipose tissue sites of two equine donors were collected and processed for histology and cell isolation. MSC frequency in these samples was estimated by means of CFU-F assays, which were performed under MSC conditions. Culture-adherent cells from equine adipose tissue and bone marrow were culture expanded, tested for differentiation into mesenchymal cell types in vitro, and implanted in vivo in porous ceramic vehicles to assess their osteogenic capacity, using human MSCs and brain pericytes as controls. The differentiation assays showed a difference between adipose tissue-derived cells as compared to equine bone marrow MSCs. While differences in CFU-F frequencies between both donors were evident, the CFU-F numbers correlated directly with blood vessel densities (r(2) = 0.86).

{"title": "Reduced COX-2 expression in aged mice is associated with impaired fracture healing.", "abstract": "The cellular and molecular events responsible for reduced fracture healing with aging are unknown. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), the inducible regulator of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthesis, is critical for normal bone repair. A femoral fracture repair model was used in mice at either 7-9 or 52-56 wk of age, and healing was evaluated by imaging, histology, and gene expression studies. Aging was associated with a decreased rate of chondrogenesis, decreased bone formation, reduced callus vascularization, delayed remodeling, and altered expression of genes involved in repair and remodeling. COX-2 expression in young mice peaked at 5 days, coinciding with the transition of mesenchymal progenitors to cartilage and the onset of expression of early cartilage markers. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that COX-2 is expressed primarily in early cartilage precursors that co-express col-2. COX-2 expression was reduced by 75% and 65% in fractures from aged mice compared with young mice on days 5 and 7, respectively. Local administration of an EP4 agonist to the fracture repair site in aged mice enhanced the rate of chondrogenesis and bone formation to levels observed in young mice, suggesting that the expression of COX-2 during the early inflammatory phase of repair regulates critical subsequent events including chondrogenesis, bone formation, and remodeling. The findings suggest that COX-2/EP4 agonists may compensate for deficient molecular signals that result in the reduced fracture healing associated with aging.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2008-10-14", "authors": ["Amish ANaik", "ChaoXie", "Michael JZuscik", "PaulKingsley", "Edward MSchwarz", "HaniAwad", "RobertGuldberg", "HichamDrissi", "J EdwardPuzas", "BrendanBoyce", "XinpingZhang", "Regis JO'Keefe"], "doi": "10.1359/jbmr.081002"}
{"title": "Altered placental function of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 knockout mice.", "abstract": "Fetal glucocorticoid exposure is a key mechanism proposed to underlie prenatal \"programming\" of adult cardiometabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Regulation of fetal glucocorticoid exposure is achieved by the placental glucocorticoid \"barrier,\" which involves glucocorticoid inactivation within the labyrinth zone of the murine placenta by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11beta-HSD2). Thus, the absence of placental 11beta-HSD2 may impact on fetal and placental development. The current study investigated transport of amino acids and glucose, key factors required for fetal growth, and vascular development in placentas from 11beta-HSD2(+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) fetuses derived from 11beta-HSD2(+/-) matings. At embryonic d 15 (E15) (term = E19), 11beta-HSD2(-/-) fetal weight was maintained in comparison to 11beta-HSD2(+/+) fetuses. The maintenance of 11beta-HSD2(-/-) fetal weight occurred despite a reduction in placental weight, suggesting that compensatory changes occur in the placenta to maintain function. However, by E18, 11beta-HSD2(-/-) fetal and placental weights were both reduced. Transport studies revealed up-regulation of placental amino acid transport to 11beta-HSD2(-/-) offspring at E15, coinciding with an increase in the expression of the amino acid transporters. Furthermore, at E18, placental glucose transport to 11beta-HSD2(-/-) offspring was markedly reduced, correlating with lower fetal weight and a decrease in glucose transporter 3 expression. Stereological analyses of the labyrinth zone of the placenta revealed that the reduction in placental weight at E18 was associated with restriction of the normal increase in fetal vessel density over the final third of pregnancy. Our data suggest that restriction of fetal growth in 11beta-HSD2(-/-) mice is mediated, at least in part, via altered placental transport of nutrients and reduction in placental vascularization.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2008-10-11", "authors": ["Caitlin SWyrwoll", "Jonathan RSeckl", "Megan CHolmes"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2008-1100"}
{"title": "Induction of endostatin expression in meniscal fibrochondrocytes by co-culture with endothelial cells.", "abstract": "The ultimate goal after meniscus damage is the preservation of the original meniscal tissue, which is often impossible due to the limited healing capacity of meniscal lesions, especially in the avascular zone. Factors produced by endothelial cells of meniscal vessels may contribute to better wound healing in vascularized zones. We therefore investigated the expression of different angiogenic factors, growth hormones and cytokines in human fibrochondrocytes and in fibrochondrocytes upon co-culture with endothelial cells, to examine mechanisms of repair of meniscal injury in more detail and to investigate the potential use of endothelial cells in co-cultures for autologous meniscal repair utilizing tissue engineering technology.\nGene expression of SMAD-4, iNOS, IL-1beta, VEGF, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, aggrecan, biglycan, vimentin, collagen-I, -II, -III, -IV, -VI, -X, -XVIII, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and thrombostatin-1 were investigated in fibrochondrocytes in comparison to cells in co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).

A proliferation assay was used to investigate the mitotic activity of the cells.\nIn presence of HUVEC, meniscal fibrochondrocytes expressed SMAD-4, iNOS, IL-1beta, VEGF, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, aggrecan, biglycan, vimentin, collagen-I, -II, -III, -VI, and -XVIII at rates comparable to cells without HUVECs. Note that the expression of endostatin was significantly higher in the co-culture when compared to the separate fibrochondrocyte cultures and the proliferation rate of endothelial cells was significantly decreased in co-culture.\nWe conclude that the expression of the anti-angiogenic factor endostatin increased in the fibrochondrocytes.

We have demonstrated that VEGF regulates the expression of CCN2/connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) an essential mediator of cartilage development and angiogenesis, suggesting that CCN2 functions in down-stream of VEGF, and that VEGF function is mediated in part by CCN2. On the other hand, the phenotype of Ccn2 mutant growth plates, which exhibit decreased expression of VEGF in the hypertrophic zone, indicates that Vegf expression is dependent on Ccn2 expression as well. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of VEGF by CCN2 using a human chondrocytic cell line, HCS-2/8. Hypoxic stimulation (5% O(2)) of HCS-2/8 cells increased VEGF mRNA levels by approximately 8 fold within 6 h as compared with the cells cultured under normoxia. In addition, VEGF expression was further up-regulated under hypoxia in HCS-2/8 cells transfected with a Ccn2 expression plasmid. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mRNA and protein levels were increased by stimulation with recombinant CCN2 (rCCN2). Furthermore, the activity of a VEGF promoter that contained a HIF-1 binding site was increased in HCS-2/8, when the cells were stimulated by rCCN2. These results suggest that CCN2 regulates the expression of VEGF at a transcriptional level by promoting HIF-1alpha activity. In fact, HIF-1alpha was detected in the nuclei of proliferative and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes of wild-type mice, whereas it was not detected in Ccn2 mutant chondrocytes in vivo.

{"title": "Recruitment of pericytes and astrocytes is closely related to the formation of tight junction in developing retinal vessels.", "abstract": "During retinal development, retinal vascularization begins in the inner retinal layer and sprouts radially from the optic nerve to reach the periphery of the retina. Subsequently, retinal vessels sprout into the deep retinal layer to form three parallel of the nerve fiber layer and two plexiform layers. In this process, endothelial cells are closely related to astrocytes and pericytes with strict chronological order. Here, we provide that the recruitment of pericytes and astrocytes to vascular tube of endothelial cells is closely associated with the formation of tight junction in developing retinal vessels. At P4, endothelial cells of retinal vessels behind the invading front directly contact to pericytes, but not to foot processes of astrocytes, where ZO-1 was already weakly immunoreactive along retinal endothelial cells. With the progression of retinal development, foot processes of astrocytes are gathered around retinal vessels and the maturation of tight junction in endothelial cells is clearly defined, which was temporally and spatially accordant to the expression of a tight junction protein, ZO-1. In addition, tight junction could be formed with contact of pericytes to endothelial cells without the prominent ensheathment of astrocytic foot processes, which coincided with the appearance of a tight junction protein, ZO-1. Therefore, these data demonstrate that the tight junction of endothelial cells in the blood-retina barrier could be developed by cellular interactions between pericytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Moreover, ZO-1 as well as occludin or claudin might demonstrate the tightness of blood-retina barrier in developing retina.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience research", "date": "2008-09-26", "authors": ["Jeong HunKim", "Jin HyoungKim", "Young SukYu", "Dong HunKim", "Kyu-WonKim"], "doi": "10.1002/jnr.21884"}

Since PKR1 and PKR2 are 85% identical and expressed in cardiovascular tissues, we hypothesized that PKR2 may also contribute to cardiomyocyte growth and vascularization.\nWe have generated TG mice overexpressing PKR2 in cardiomyocytes. TG mice exhibit increased hypertrophic gene expression and heart-to-body weight ratio accompanied by an increased length of cardiomyocytes at the age of 12 weeks. Increased left ventricular end-systolic and diastolic diameters without cardiac dysfunction at the age of 24 weeks indicate that TG mice have an eccentric hypertrophy with compensated cardiac function. Quantitative morphological analysis showed that TG hearts have a normal microvessel density and number of branch points. However, they exhibit increased abnormal endothelial cell shape and ultrastructure, changed cellular distribution of a tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), and vascular leakage in heart without a rise of angiogenic factor levels at early and late age. The application of media conditioned by H9c2 cardioblast cells overexpressing PKR2 significantly induced impaired ZO-1 localization in H5V endothelial cells, mimicking the TG model.\nThese findings provide the first genetic evidence that cardiomyocyte PKR2 signalling leads to eccentric hypertrophy in an autocrine regulation and impaired endothelial integrity in a paracrine regulation without inducing angiogenesis.

PEGDA hydrogel is intrinsically cell nonadhesive and highly resistant to protein adsorption, allowing a high degree of control over presentation of ligands for cell adhesion and signaling. Since these materials are photopolymerizable, a variety of photolithographic technologies may be applied to spatially control presentation of bioactive ligands. To manipulate EC adhesion, migration, and tubulogenesis, the surface of PEGDA hydrogels was micropatterned with a cell adhesive ligand, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), in desired concentrations and geometries. ECs cultured on these RGDS patterns reorganized their cell bodies into cord-like structures on 50-microm-wide stripes, but not on wider stripes, suggesting that EC morphogenesis can be regulated by geometrical cues. The cords formed by ECs were reminiscent of capillaries with cells participating in the self-assembly and reorganization into multicellular structures. Further, endothelial cord formation was stimulated on intermediate concentration of RGDS at 20 microg/cm(2), whereas it was inhibited at higher concentrations.

{"title": "Predicting drug pharmacokinetics and effect in vascularized tumors using computer simulation.", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the pharmacokinetics and effect of doxorubicin and cisplatin in vascularized tumors through two-dimensional simulations. We take into account especially vascular and morphological heterogeneity as well as cellular and lesion-level pharmacokinetic determinants like P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux and cell density. To do this we construct a multi-compartment PKPD model calibrated from published experimental data and simulate 2-h bolus administrations followed by 18-h drug washout. Our results show that lesion-scale drug and nutrient distribution may significantly impact therapeutic efficacy and should be considered as carefully as genetic determinants modulating, for example, the production of multidrug-resistance protein or topoisomerase II. We visualize and rigorously quantify distributions of nutrient, drug, and resulting cell inhibition. A main result is the existence of significant heterogeneity in all three, yielding poor inhibition in a large fraction of the lesion, and commensurately increased serum drug concentration necessary for an average 50% inhibition throughout the lesion (the IC(50) concentration). For doxorubicin the effect of hypoxia and hypoglycemia (\"nutrient effect\") is isolated and shown to further increase cell inhibition heterogeneity and double the IC(50), both undesirable. We also show how the therapeutic effectiveness of doxorubicin penetration therapy depends upon other determinants affecting drug distribution, such as cellular efflux and density, offering some insight into the conditions under which otherwise promising therapies may fail and, more importantly, when they will succeed. Cisplatin is used as a contrast to doxorubicin since both published experimental data and our simulations indicate its lesion distribution is more uniform than that of doxorubicin. Because of this some of the complexity in predicting its therapeutic efficacy is mitigated. Using this advantage, we show results suggesting that in vitro monolayer assays using this drug may more accurately predict in vivo performance than for drugs like doxorubicin. The nonlinear interaction among various determinants representing cell and lesion phenotype as well as therapeutic strategies is a unifying theme of our results. Throughout it can be appreciated that macroscopic environmental conditions, notably drug and nutrient distributions, give rise to considerable variation in lesion response, hence clinical resistance. Moreover, the synergy or antagonism of combined therapeutic strategies depends heavily upon this environment.", "journal": "Journal of mathematical biology", "date": "2008-09-11", "authors": ["John PSinek", "SandeepSanga", "XiaomingZheng", "Hermann BFrieboes", "MauroFerrari", "VittorioCristini"], "doi": "10.1007/s00285-008-0214-y\n10.1016/S0022-5193(03)00244-3\n10.1006/bulm.1998.0042\n10.1023/A:1008040117882\n10.1016/j.bulm.2003.11.002\n10.1006/mvre.1996.0031\n10.1016/S1478-5382(03)02218-2\n10.1016/S0895-7177(00)00143-6\n10.1016/S0092-8240(03)00027-2\n10.1016/0895-7177(96)00019-2\n10.1083/jcb.148.5.863\n10.1006/jcph.2001.6713\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0852\n10.1007/s00285-002-0174-6\n10.1007/BF00255912\n10.1016/S0006-2952(98)00255-X\n10.1016/0167-4889(90)90111-P\n10.1002/cyto.990200406\n10.1007/BF02897199\n10.1593/neo.05118\n10.1038/nrc1566\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.03.008\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3166\n10.1677/erc.0.0090171\n10.1007/s10439-007-9423-6\n10.1006/jtbi.2003.3156\n10.1016/S0168-3659(01)00306-6\n10.1016/0006-2952(93)90019-S\n10.1529/biophysj.105.060640\n10.1007/BF01236386\n10.1016/0968-0004(87)90011-9\n10.1023/A:1020755124451\n10.1016/j.jcp.2004.08.010\n10.1016/j.jcp.2005.11.016\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.12.004\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.12.022\n10.1006/bulm.2002.0293\n10.1016/0022-2836(74)90031-X\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6602710\n10.1038/nrc1893\n10.1016/j.mcm.2005.09.026\n10.1038/427695a\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00085-0\n10.1016/S0893-9659(98)00038-X\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1664\n10.1073/pnas.241509698\n10.1021/bi00427a038\n10.1124/dmd.30.2.183\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.05.043\n10.1586/14737140.6.10.1361\n10.1016/S0305-7372(03)00003-3\n10.1073/pnas.91.9.3497\n10.1023/B:BMMD.0000048562.29657.64\n10.1006/excr.1999.4551\n10.1016/j.mcm.2004.07.021\n10.1007/BF00685154\n10.1016/S0003-4975(01)03054-5\n10.1016/0167-4889(89)90038-4\n10.1126/science.2108497\n10.1016/0959-8049(92)90391-E\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000401)86:1<101::AID-IJC16>3.0.CO;2-I\n10.1007/s002850000038\n10.1038/nrd1691\n10.1016/S0025-5564(02)00148-7\n10.1208/ps030215\n10.1016/j.bulm.2004.08.001"}

We perform nonlinear simulations of the multi-scale model that demonstrate the importance of the coupling between the development and remodeling of the vascular network, the blood flow through the network and the tumour progression. Consistent with clinical observations, the hydrostatic stress generated by tumour cell proliferation shuts down large portions of the vascular network dramatically affecting the flow, the subsequent network remodeling, the delivery of nutrients to the tumour and the subsequent tumour progression. In addition, extracellular matrix degradation by tumour cells is seen to have a dramatic affect on both the development of the vascular network and the growth response of the tumour.

Not least, the mitral valve contributes to the make up and function of the left ventricular outflow tract. The anatomical and functional interdependence between the mitral valve and the left ventricular myocardium is evident not only following their particularities of vascularization but also it is reflected in morbid states such as ischemic cardiac disease and dilated cardiomyopathy.

An additional cell type being studied in the field of tumor vascularization is the circulating endothelial cell (CEC), whose presence in elevated numbers reflects vascular injury. Levels of EPCs and CECs are reported to correlate with tumor stage and have been evaluated as biomarkers of the efficacy of anticancer/antiangiogenic treatments. Furthermore, because EPCs and subtypes of proangiogenic HCs are actively participating in capillary growth, these cells are attractive potential vehicles for delivering therapeutic molecules.

The diverse functions of Eph/ephrin are largely related to the complementary expression pattern of the Eph receptors and corresponding ephrin ligands that are expressed in adjacent compartments, although overlapping expression pattern also exists in epithelial tissue.

In this work, scaffold-less 3D bone-like tissues were engineered from rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and their autogenous extracellular matrix (ECM). The BMSCs were cultured on a 2D substrate in medium that induced osteogenic differentiation. After reaching confluence and producing a sufficient amount of their own ECM, the cells contracted their tissue monolayer around two constraint points, forming scaffold-less cylindrical engineered bone-like constructs (EBCs). The EBCs exhibited alizarin red staining for mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activity and contained type I collagen. The EBCs developed a periosteum characterized by fibroblasts and unmineralized collagen on the periphery of the construct. Tensile tests revealed that the EBCs in culture had a tangent modulus of 7.5 +/- 0.5 MPa at 7 days post-3D construct formation and 29 +/- 9 MPa at 6 weeks after construct formation. Implantation of the EBCs into rats 7 days after construct formation resulted in further bone development and vascularization.

{"title": "Glial vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression in rat brainstem under tolerable hypoxia: evidence for a central chemosensitivity.", "abstract": "The ventilatory response to hypoxia is mediated by peripheral inputs arising from the arterial chemoreceptors. In their absence, hypoxic adaptation can be achieved, possibly as a result of central cellular reorganization. To study this reorganization, we used chemodenervated rats to investigate the expression and localization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the brainstem. VEGF is a target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) that is responsible for the morphofunctional remodeling induced by hypoxia. Intact and chemodenervated rats were subjected to normoxia or hypoxia for 6 hr (10% O(2) in N(2)). VEGF protein was quantified in micropunches of brainstem tissue. Only chemodenervated animals showed an increased VEGF expression in response to hypoxia, whereas, in normoxia, VEGF expression was not modified by chemodenervation. The same hypoxic condition was repeated for 8 days before immunocytochemical staining with anti-VEGF; antiglial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes; and anti-rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (anti-RECA-1) that recognizes endothelial cells. Confocal analysis showed a cellular colocalization of GFAP and VEGF, indicating that VEGF was overexpressed predominantly in astrocytes. Increased RECA-1 immunolabeling indicated an enhanced angiogenesis in chemodenervated rats subjected to hypoxia. These results indicate that glial cells and the vascular network contribute to the brainstem remodeling.

{"title": "Characterization of the structure and permeability of titanium foams for spinal fusion devices.", "abstract": "Titanium foams produced via the space-holder method are used for spinal fusion devices since their combination of an open-cell structure and bone-like mechanical properties promises potentially excellent bone ingrowth. Earlier studies have indicated that the size of the pores and interconnects must be greater than 100microm for effective bone ingrowth and vascularization. Hence, the quantification of the pore and interconnect size is required for efficient scaffold design. In this study, microcomputed tomography (microCT) was used to obtain the three-dimensional (3D) structure of Ti foams with three levels of porosity (51%, 65% and 78%). Novel algorithms were then applied to quantify both the pore and interconnect size of Ti foams as a function of porosity. All foams possessed a modal pore and interconnect size in excess of 300microm, satisfying the requirement of being greater than 100microm. The pore and interconnect size also dominates the flow properties or permeability of open-cell structures.

However, most porous materials carry some intrinsic limits because of their internal structure (i.e., limited macroporosity and small pore interconnection size), representing a physical constraint for a massive blood afflux and bone ingrowth and therefore for generating effective osteopermissive grafts. We therefore hypothesized that an unconventional scaffold, based on an \"open-structure\" concept, should not pose any limit to vascularization of grafts and consequently to the amount of bone growth. Starting from this hypothesis, we have designed and developed a 3D osteoconductive polymeric-based wide-net mesh. Polymer fibers, joining hydroxyapatite beads, were coated with a thin layer of calcium phosphate (Ca-P), coupling the osteoconductivity properties of Ca-P with the handness and bulk properties of polymers. This completely open 3D scaffold prototype was tested both in vitro and in vivo, displaying a promising in vivo blood vessel invasion and bone-forming efficiency.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Although human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs) are known to release factors that stimulate new blood vessel formation, detailed information about the effects of adipogenic differentiation on the angiogenic potential of hASCs remains largely unknown. In the present study, we studied the expression and secretion of a large panel of angiogenic factors during hASC differentiation and evaluated the effects of hASC-conditioned medium (hASC-CM) on endothelial cells.\nhASCs were cultured on adipogenic medium or basal medium. Conditioned medium was collected, and cells were harvested following 0, 3, 7, 14, and 22 days of culture. The stage of adipogenic differentiation of hASC was assessed using Oil Red O staining, fatty acid binding protein-4 gene expression, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity.\nGene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor, angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), and protein secretion of VEGF significantly increased during short-term adipogenic differentiation of hASCs. Moreover, conditioned medium from differentiated hASCs strongly enhanced endothelial cell numbers compared to conditioned medium from undifferentiated hASCs.\nIn vitro adipogenic differentiation of hASCs improves their ability to support endothelial viable cell numbers and suggests that hASCs differentiated for a short period potentially improve angiogenic responses for in vivo implantation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Therefore, we have studied capillary morphogenesis under controlled biological and biophysical conditions with the aim of promoting vascular structures in tissue constructs. We and others have previously demonstrated that physiological values of interstitial fluid flow normal to an endothelial monolayer in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor play a critical role during capillary morphogenesis by promoting cell sprouting. In the present work, we studied the effect that a range of interstitial flow velocities (0-50 microm/min) has in promoting the amount, length, and branching of developing sprouts during capillary morphogenesis. The number of capillary-like structures developed from human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers across the interstitial flow values tested was not significantly affected. Instead, the length and branching degree of the sprouts presented a significant maximum at flow velocities of 10 to 20 microm/min. More-over, at these same flow values, the phosphorylation level of Src also showed its peak. We discovered that capillary morphogenesis is restricted to patches of Src-activated cells (phosphorylated Src (pSrc)) at the monolayer, suggesting that the transduction pathway in charge of sensing the mechanical stimulus induced by flow is promoting predetermined mechanically sensitive areas (pSrc) to undergo capillary morphogenesis", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The rats were randomly divided into three groups, a sham group consisting of five rats and the other two groups consisting of ten rats. In group 1 (sham group), right orchiectomy with no additional intervention was performed. In group 2 (T/D group), torsion was created by rotating the testis 720 degrees in a clockwise direction for 4 h. After a 4-h torsion period, the right testis was detorted and replaced into the scrotum for 4 h. After the torsion, 0.5 cc 0.9% NaCl solution was injected once and three times in a week (total 12 doses). In group 3 (T/D + erythropoietin; EPO group), the same surgical procedure was done as in group 1, but EPO 1,000 IU/kg was injected just before the detorsion and three times in a week.

Extremely significant differences in testicular weight were observed in group 1 compared to groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.001).\nAdministration of EPO significantly influenced the rescue of testicular function by preserving the intact seminiferous tubular morphology, lowering the percentage of necrotic seminipherous tubules, and significantly reducing histological damage (P < 0.05).", "journal": "International urology and nephrology", "date": "2008-07-16", "authors": ["BurhanK\u00f6seo\u011flu", "EnginYilmaz", "KadirCeylan", "ErsanUzun", "IrfanBayram", "FatihHizli"], "doi": "10.1007/s11255-008-9418-8"}
{"title": "In vivo engineering of a human vasculature for bone tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "The neovascularization of three-dimensional voluminous tissues, such as bone, represents an important challenge in tissue engineering applications. The formation of a preformed vascular plexus could maintain cell viability and promote vascularization after transplantation. We have developed a three-dimensional spheroidal coculture system consisting of human primary endothelial cells and human primary osteoblasts (hOBs) to improve angiogenesis in bone tissue engineering applications. In this study, we investigated the survival and vascularization of the engineered implants in vivo. Endothelial cell spheroids were cocultured with hOBs in fibrin and seeded into scaffolds consisting of processed bovine cancellous bone (PBCB). The cell-seeded scaffolds were evaluated for their angiogenic potential in two different in vivo assays: the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and the severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID) mouse model. In both assays, the development of a complex three-dimensional network of perfused human neovessels could be detected. After subcutaneous implantation into immunodeficient mice, the newly formed human vasculature was stabilized by the recruitment of murine smooth muscle alpha-actin-positive mural cells and anastomoses with the mouse vasculature. We conclude that this endothelial cell spheroid system can be used to create a network of functional perfused blood vessels in vivo. The finding that this process takes place with high efficacy in the presence of co-implanted primary osteoblasts and in an osteoconductive environment provided by the PBCB scaffold, suggests that this system may be suitable for improving vascularization in bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2008-07-16", "authors": ["LilianSteffens", "AndreasWenger", "G Bj\u00f6rnStark", "G\u00fcnterFinkenzeller"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00418.x"}

{"title": "The tumor microenvironment and metastatic disease.", "abstract": "The microenvironment of solid tumors is a heterogeneous, complex milieu for tumor growth and survival that includes features such as acidic pH, low nutrient levels, elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and chronic and fluctuating levels of oxygenation that relate to the abnormal vascular network that exists in tumors. The metastatic potential of tumor cells is believed to be regulated by interactions between the tumor cells and their extracellular environment (extracellular matrix (ECM)). These interactions can be modified by the accumulation of genetic changes and by the transient alterations in gene expression induced by the local tumor microenvironment. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that altered gene expression in response to the hypoxic microenvironment is a contributing factor to increased metastatic efficiency. A number of genes that have been implicated in the metastatic process, involving angiogenesis, intra/extravasation, survival and growth, have been found to be hypoxia-responsive. The various metastatic determinants, genetic and epigenetic, somatic and inherited may serve as precedents for the future identification of more genes that are involved in metastasis.

{"title": "Societal interactions in ovarian cancer metastasis: a quorum-sensing hypothesis.", "abstract": "The biochemical and biological mechanisms metastatic cancer cells use to function as communities and thwart internal and external growth control mechanisms remain undefined. In this work, we present the hypothesis that cancer cells may use a Quorum-Sensing mechanism to regulate multicellular functions and control steps in metastatic colonization. Quorum sensing is a bacterial cell-cell communication process used to track increasing cell-population density and, in response to changes in cell number, coordinate gene expression and behavior on a community-wide scale. Important parallels between the behavior of societies of bacterial cells and societies of malignant cancer cells exist in the bacterial literature. Of relevance to metastasis is the finding that pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing to determine when their population numbers are high enough to collectively form biofilms in or on host organisms. Biofilms are complex, heterogeneous communities of bacterial cells encased within an extracellular matrix attached to a solid surface. Biofilms exacerbate disease and are refractory to a battery of therapies. We suggest that the quorum-sensing-controlled bacterial biofilm formation process closely parallels the steps in metastatic colonization. Cells migrate toward/on target surfaces (organ-specific homing), show cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (tumor cell-stromal cell crosstalk), remain subclinical until they can mount an effective attack (dormancy), form complex structures with channels for nutrient flow (vascularized lesions), and contain resistant cells which can cause disease recurrence (persistors).

After visualization, the whole vascular network was digitally segmented showing an excellent overlapping with the original pictures. Quantification over the digitally segmented picture was performed, and an index of vascularization area (VAI) and length (VLI) of the vessel network was obtained in target tissues. VAI/VLI ratio was calculated to obtain the vessel size index.\nWe present a new technique which has several advantages compared to others, as animals do not require intravascular perfusions, total areas of interest can be quantitatively analyzed at once, and the same target tissue can be processed for further experimental analysis.", "journal": "Langenbeck's archives of surgery", "date": "2008-05-07", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1sEga\u00f1a", "AlexandruCondurache", "J\u00f6rn AndreasLohmeyer", "MathiasKremer", "Beate MSt\u00f6ckelhuber", "SergioLavandero", "Hans-G\u00fcntherMachens"], "doi": "10.1007/s00423-008-0333-3"}

{"title": "Incidence and distribution of blood vessels in punch biopsies of Palmer 1A disc lesions in the wrist.", "abstract": "Although the partial excision of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears appears to be a clinically effective technique, little is known about the ability of the central disc tears to heal. Unlike peripheral tears, central tears do not have immediate access to blood supply. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence and distribution of blood vessels in punch biopsies of symptomatic central TFCC tissue. In addition, the study investigated if arthroscopic debridement can reach vascularized tissue to enable a reparative response of the tear.\nThirty-two patients with symptomatic central traumatic tears in the TFCC (Palmer 1A) were included in this study. The cartilage was debrided arthroscopically using a biopsy punch. The debrided tissue was then examined histologically. To visualize blood vessels, the histological sections were stained with CD 31 antibodies. The presence/absence of blood vessels was recorded on a qualitative level.\nIn six patients, five or more blood vessels (CD31 positive endothelial cells) could be detected. In eight patients, fewer than five vessels could be found in the periphery of the slides. In 18 patients no vessels could be identified. The incidence of vessels in the outer region was higher than in the inner region of the peripheral area. There was no correlation found between the time of trauma and incidence of blood vessels (P > 0.05).\nOnly in 43% of arthroscopic debridements of Palmer 1A tears vascularized tissue could be reached.", "journal": "Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery", "date": "2008-04-26", "authors": ["FrankUnglaub", "Markus WKroeber", "Susanne BThomas", "Maya BWolf", "AndreasArkudas", "AdrianDragu", "Raymund EHorch"], "doi": "10.1007/s00402-008-0629-3"}
{"title": "Homeostasis of glutamate in brain fluids: an accelerated brain-to-blood efflux of excess glutamate is produced by blood glutamate scavenging and offers protection from neuropathologies.", "abstract": "L-Glutamate (Glu) homeostasis in brain extracellular fluids and its maintenance at low micromolar concentrations in the face of the extremely high Glu concentrations present in brain cells and synaptic vesicles have been commonly attributed to the very effective action of glutamate transporters present on neuronal and glial cells. This view however does not take into account the fact that the brain is highly vascularized and that the vasculature harbors a high density of glutamate transporters. In this article, we review the accumulated data establishing the existence of an efflux of excess Glu from brain extracellular fluids into blood. We describe plausible mechanisms accounting for this efflux and present evidence that the brain-to-blood Glu efflux is modulated by blood Glu levels and can be accelerated by blood Glu scavenging. The latter procedure shown here to afford brain neuroprotection in a rat model of closed head injury could be applicable, as a first-line therapy, in the various acute brain insults characterized by excess Glu in brain fluids.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2008-04-22", "authors": ["V ITeichberg", "KCohen-Kashi-Malina", "ICooper", "AZlotnik"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.02.075"}
{"title": "Endothelial cell differentiation of human breast tumour stem/progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Breast tumour stem cells have been reported to differentiate in the epithelial lineage but a cross-lineage potential has not been investigated. We aimed to evaluate whether breast tumour stem cells were able to differentiate also into the endothelial lineage. We isolated and cloned a population of breast tumour stem cells, cultured as mammospheres that expressed the stem markers nestin and Oct-4 and not epithelial and endothelial differentiation markers, and formed serially transplantable tumours in SCID mice. When cultured in the presence of serum, mammosphere-derived clones differentiated in the epithelial lineage. When cultured in the presence of VEGF, the same clones were also able to differentiate in the endothelial lineage acquiring endothelial markers and properties, such as the ability to organize in Matrigel into capillary-like structures. In the transplanted tumours, originated from mammospheres, we demonstrate that some of the intratumour vessels were of human origin, suggesting an in vivo endothelial differentiation of mammosphere-derived cells. Finally, endothelial cell clones originated from mammospheres were able, when implanted in Matrigel in SCID mice, to form after 7 days a human vessel network and, after 3-4 weeks, an epithelial tumour suggesting that in the endothelial-differentiated cells a tumourigenic stem cell population is maintained. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that stem cells of breast cancer have the ability to differentiate not only in epithelial but also in endothelial lineage, further supporting the hypothesis that the tumour-initiating population possesses stem cell characteristics relevant for tumour growth and vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2008-04-16", "authors": ["BenedettaBussolati", "CristinaGrange", "AnnaSapino", "GiovanniCamussi"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00338.x"}

Baseline characteristics such as surgery-rejection interval, time taken to consult after onset of symptoms, history of failed grafts, extent of stromal vascularization, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and corneal thickness at the time of presentation were noted. Main outcome measures following treatment for rejection included improvement in BCVA, change in corneal thickness, and reversal of graft rejection.\nFifty-one patients were treated with i.v. methylprednisolone and 47 with i.v. dexamethasone, in addition to topical steroids. Both groups were found to be comparable with respect to baseline parameters, that is, time taken to present, history of failed grafts, extent of stromal vascularization, BCVA, and graft thickness. Graft rejection could be successfully reversed in 72.3% cases in the dexamethasone group and 49% in the methylprednisolone group (P=0.018). A significant improvement in visual acuity was recorded following treatment in both groups, with a better outcome in the dexamethasone group (P=0.012).

Culture periods of 8, 12, and 16 days were selected to allow for different amounts of ECM deposition by the cells as well as ECM with varying degrees of maturity (Ti/ECM/d8, Ti/ECM/d12, and Ti/ECM/d16, respectively). These ECM-containing constructs were implanted intramuscularly in a rat animal model. After 56 days, histologic analysis of retrieved constructs revealed no bone formation in any of the implants. Surrounding many of the implants was a fibrous capsule, which was often interspersed with fat cells. Within the pore spaces, the predominant tissue response was the presence of blood vessels and young fibroblasts or fat cells. The number of blood vessels on a per area basis calculated from a histomorphometric analysis increased as a function of the amount of ECM within the implanted constructs, with a significant difference between Ti/ECM/d16 and plain Ti constructs. These results indicate that although an in vitro generated ECM alone may not induce bone formation at an ectopic site, its use may enhance the vascularization of implanted constructs.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Therapeutic metformin/AMPK activation promotes the angiogenic phenotype in the ERalpha negative MDA-MB-435 breast cancer model.", "abstract": "Metformin, a first line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has been implicated as a potential anti-neoplastic agent for breast cancers as well as other cancers. Metformin is known to work in part through the activation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, especially under stress conditions where biosynthetic pathways are blocked by the phosphorylation of downstream AMPK substrates. Stimulation of AMPK by metformin resulted in a significant repression of cell proliferation and active MAPK1/2 in both estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) negative (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435) and positive (MCF-7, T47D) human breast cancer cell lines. However, when ERalpha negative MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with metformin, they demonstrated increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in an AMPK dependent manner; while the ERalpha positive MCF-7 cells did not. Systemic therapy with metformin was tested for efficacy in an orthotopic model of ERalpha negative breast cancer performed in athymic nude mice. Surprisingly, metformin therapy significantly improved tumorigenic progression as compared to untreated controls. The metformin-treated group showed increased VEGF expression, intratumoral microvascular density and reduced necrosis. Metformin treatment was sufficient, however, to reduce systemic IGF-1 and the proliferation rate of tumor cells in vascularized regions. The data presented here suggests that, although metformin significantly represses breast cancer cell growth in vitro, the efficacy with respect to its therapeutic application for ERalpha negative breast cancer lesions in vivo may result in promotion of the angiogenic phenotype and increased tumorigenic progression.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2008-02-08", "authors": ["Kathryn NPhoenix", "FrankVumbaca", "Kevin PClaffey"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-008-9916-5\n10.1074/jbc M412994200"}
{"title": "Hepatic Circulation: Physiology and Pathophysiology", "abstract": "The Hepatic circulation is unique among vascular beds. The most obvious unique features include the dual vascular supply; the mechanism of intrinsic regulation of the hepatic artery (the hepatic arterial buffer response); the fact that portal blood flow, supplying two thirds of liver blood flow, is not controlled directly by the liver; the fact that 20% of the cardiac output rushes through the most vascularized organ in the body, driven by a pressure gradient of only a few millimeters of mercury; the extremely distensible capacitance and venous resistance sites; the unidirectional acinar blood flow that regulates parenchymal cell metabolic specialization; and the high concentration of macrophagic (Kupffer) cells filtering the blood. The liver is the only organ reported to have regional blood flow monitored by the autonomic nervous system. This mechanism, when dysfunctional, accounts for the hepatorenal syndrome and offers a mechanistic therapeutic target to treat this syndrome. The trigger for liver regeneration is dependent on hepatic hemodynamics so that chronic liver blood flow regulates liver cell mass. In severe liver disease, the whole body circulation is reorganized, by forming portacaval shunts, to accommodate the increased intrahepatic venous resistance. These shunts protect the venous drainage of the splanchnic organs but lead to loss of major regulatory roles of the liver. The development of knowledge of the hepatic vasculature is presented from a historical perspective with modern concepts summarized based on the perspective of the author\u2019s four decades of devotion to this most marvelous of organs.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2009", "authors": ["W.
