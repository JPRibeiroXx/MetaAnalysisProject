{"title": "Biofabrication: using biological materials and biocatalysts to construct nanostructured assemblies.", "abstract": "Emerging opportunities are placing greater demands on device fabrication: next-generation microelectronics will need minimum features of less than 100 nm, high-throughput drug screening will require facile methods to incorporate sensitive biological components into microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and implantable devices will need to be built from biocompatible materials. Increasingly, these emerging demands are being addressed by combining traditional microfabrication methods with 'biofabrication': namely, the use of biologically derived materials and biocatalysts. Recent fabrication techniques are using biological construction materials as process aids or structural components, and enzymes are being considered for their potential to fabricate devices with high selectivity under mild conditions. If incompatibilities between biology and microfabrication can be eliminated, then biofabrication will be poised to emerge as the standard for nanoscale construction.", "journal": "Trends in biotechnology", "date": "2004-10-20", "authors": ["Li-QunWu", "Gregory FPayne"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.09.008"}
