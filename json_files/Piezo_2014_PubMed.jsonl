The Bz-PAT polymer chemical structure induces the formation of a disordered film with numerous vacancies and the size of these defects could be exploited for a reversible trapping of mercuric ions. For these reasons the Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) deposition method has been employed for transferring Bz-PAT layers with the desired accurate bi-dimensional organization control of the layer and with a high control of the deposition parameters. In this contribution, the frequency variation of quartz crystal microbalances functionalized with 10, 20, 30 and 40 LS runs of Bz-PAT have been investigated in response to the injection of aqueous solutions of HgCl2, Pb(NO3)2, NiCl2, CdCl2 and ZnSO4 at different concentrations (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM). An almost linear dependence on the number of the LS layers and hence on the film thickness, measured by means of ellipsometric spectroscopy, has been found in terms of sensor response to concentration of Hg2+ ions fluxed. By means of UV-Vis spectroscopy, the variations in the \u03c0-\u03c0* absorption band of the polymer, attributed to the thiophene segment, induced by HgCl2 injection has been analyzed and explained as a consequence of the electron transfer from the mercuric ion to the polymer solid film. These results, together with the linear relation found between the number of deposited layers and LS film thickness, suggest that the sensing mechanism can be explained both by an electron interaction between active layer and analyte and a diffusion mechanism of Hg2+ into the solid film that reaches an asymptotic value at 30 runs (about 80 nm), then a higher number of layers does not influence the sensor sensibility.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2015-05-01", "authors": ["GabrieleGiancane", "SimonaBettini", "RosannaPagano", "AlessandraOperamolla", "Omar HassanOmar", "FrancescoBabudri", "Gianluca MariaFarinola", "LudovicoValli"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2014.9347"}

Experimental groups were: Group 1: Piezoelectric ultrasonic group; Group 2: Magnetostrictive ultrasonic group; Group 3: Hand instrumentation group (Curette). After instrumentation, the teeth were extracted and the presence of residual deposits and root surface roughness were analyzed using Planimetric analyzing tool (Tool that measures the area of a plane figure as a mechanically coupled pointer traversing the perimeter of figure) and Surface Profilometer (Instrument used for profiling of an object). Root surface characteristics were evaluated qualitatively using SEM. Standardization of force, angulations and adaptation of instrument couldn't be achieved in our study due to in vivo study design rather than in vitro design in previous studies where procedure was done on the extracted teeth samples.\nThe results of the study showed that residual deposits were similar in all experimental groups. With respect to roughness parameters, Rq (Root mean square roughness) and Rt (Total roughness) a significant difference was observed (P < 0.001) among hand instrumentation and ultrasonic devices. SEM analysis revealed a similar root surface pattern for the ultrasonic devices, but curette showed many instrument scratches, gouges, and removal of large amount of cementum.\nCurette produced the rougher root surfaces than two ultrasonic devices used in the study and caused more root surface removal. Piezoelectric devices produced minimum root surface roughness but caused more root substance removal and more cracks than Magnetostrictive ultrasonic devices.", "journal": "Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology", "date": "2015-01-28", "authors": ["AntushMittal", "Ashish ShamNichani", "RanganathVenugopal", "VuppalapatiRajani"], "doi": "10.4103/0972-124X.147405"}

{"title": "Microfabricated tactile sensors for biomedical applications: a review.", "abstract": "During the last decades, tactile sensors based on different sensing principles have been developed due to the growing interest in robotics and, mainly, in medical applications. Several technological solutions have been employed to design tactile sensors; in particular, solutions based on microfabrication present several attractive features. Microfabrication technologies allow for developing miniaturized sensors with good performance in terms of metrological properties (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, low power consumption, and frequency response). Small size and good metrological properties heighten the potential role of tactile sensors in medicine, making them especially attractive to be integrated in smart interfaces and microsurgical tools. This paper provides an overview of microfabricated tactile sensors, focusing on the mean principles of sensing, i.e., piezoresistive, piezoelectric and capacitive sensors. These sensors are employed for measuring contact properties, in particular force and pressure, in three main medical fields, i.e., prosthetics and artificial skin, minimal access surgery and smart interfaces for biomechanical analysis. The working principles and the metrological properties of the most promising tactile, microfabricated sensors are analyzed, together with their application in medicine.

Films prepared in water and in the absence of template were used for control studies. Infrared spectroscopic studies demonstrated comparable chemical compositions for LC and control polymer films. SEM studies revealed that the topologies of the molecularly imprinted polymer films prepared in the LC medium (LC-MIP) exhibit discernible 40 nm thick nano-fiber structures, quite unlike the polymers prepared in the absence of the LC-phase.

Selecting the first out-of-plane vibration mode of the substrate, which has a single nodal circle, we designed and fabricated the cell collection device. The excited vibration mode properly realized our intentions. We then evaluated the cell collection ratio and the growth response, and observed the morphology of the collected cells. The collagenase and ultrasonic vibration treatment collected comparable numbers of cells to conventional trypsin and pipetting treatment, but improved the proliferating cell statistics.

A frequency-sensing readout circuit for sensing low voltage signals from piezoelectric sensors is successfully developed and tested in this work. The output voltage of a piezoelectric sensor is fed to a varactor, which is part of an Colpitts LC oscillator. The oscillation frequency is converted into a voltage using a phase locked loop.

A few years ago, in vitro and in vivo experimentation demonstrated that such fragmentation can be improved, without increasing tissue damage, by sending a second shock wave hundreds of microseconds after the previous wave. Later, numerical simulations revealed that if the second pulse had a longer full width at half maximum than a standard shock wave, cavitation could be enhanced significantly. On the other side, a theoretical study showed that stress inside the stone can be increased if two lithotripter shock waves hit the stone with a delay of only 20 \u03bcs. We used the Gilmore-Akulichev formulation to show that, in principle, both effects can be combined, that is, stress and cavitation could be increased using a pressure pulse with long full width at half maximum, which reaches the stone within hundreds of microseconds after two 20 \u03bcs-delayed initial shock waves.

Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray photoelectron trajectories suggest the formation of substantial local electric fields in the regions adjacent to those exposed to X-rays, indicating a possible electric-field-induced SHG (EFISH) mechanism for generating the observed signal. In studies of amorphous vitreous solvents, analysis of the SHG spatial profiles following X-ray microbeam exposure was consistent with an EFISH mechanism. Within protein crystals, exposure to 12-keV (1.033-\u00c5) X-rays resulted in increased SHG in the region extending \u223c 3 \u03bcm beyond the borders of the X-ray beam. Moderate X-ray exposures typical of those used for crystal centering by raster scanning through an X-ray beam were sufficient to produce static electric fields easily detectable by SHG. The X-ray-induced SHG activity was observed with no measurable loss for longer than 2 wk while maintained under cryogenic conditions, but disappeared if annealed to room temperature for a few seconds.

Relaxor-based ferroelectric single crystals Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) were chosen to be the piezoelectric transducer material due to their ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficients, high electromechanical coupling coefficients and low dielectric loss. The pulse-echo response of the transducer was measured using the conventional pulse-echo method in a water bath at room temperature. The -6 dB bandwidth of the transducer is 68.4% and the sensitivity is -17.4 dB. In order to get a good match between transducer and detection system, different transmission powers have been regulated by changing the impedance of the transmitting electric circuit. In the middle cerebral artery (MCA) measurement photograph results, as the transmission power is increasing, the detection results become clearer and clearer. A comparison at the same transmission power for different transducers shows that the detection photograph obtained by the crystal transducer was clearer than that obtained with a commercial transducer, which should make it easier for doctors to find the cerebral arteries.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2014-12-24", "authors": ["QingwenYue", "DongxuLiu", "WeiWang", "WenningDi", "DiLin", "Xi'anWang", "HaosuLuo"], "doi": "10.3390/s141224462\n10.1063/1.2942378"}

We use femtosecond optical pulses to modify the spin alignment in a Ba(0.1)Sr(0.9)TiO3 (BSTO)/La(0.7)Ca(0.3)MnO3 (LCMO) heterostructure and selectively probe the ferroelectric response using SHG. In this heterostructure, the pump pulses photoexcite non-equilibrium quasiparticles in LCMO, which rapidly interact with phonons before undergoing spin-lattice relaxation on a timescale of tens of picoseconds. This reduces the spin-spin correlations in LCMO, applying stress on BSTO through magnetostriction. This then modifies the FE polarization through the piezoelectric effect, on a timescale much faster than laser-induced heat diffusion from LCMO to BSTO. We have thus demonstrated an ultrafast indirect magnetoelectric effect in a FE/FM heterostructure mediated through elastic coupling, with a timescale primarily governed by spin-lattice relaxation in the FM layer.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2014-12-24", "authors": ["Y MSheu", "S ATrugman", "LYan", "Q XJia", "A JTaylor", "R PPrasankumar"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms6832"}
{"title": "Observation of piezoelectricity in free-standing monolayer MoS\u2082.", "abstract": "Piezoelectricity allows precise and robust conversion between electricity and mechanical force, and arises from the broken inversion symmetry in the atomic structure. Reducing the dimensionality of bulk materials has been suggested to enhance piezoelectricity. However, when the thickness of a material approaches a single molecular layer, the large surface energy can cause piezoelectric structures to be thermodynamically unstable. Transition-metal dichalcogenides can retain their atomic structures down to the single-layer limit without lattice reconstruction, even under ambient conditions. Recent calculations have predicted the existence of piezoelectricity in these two-dimensional crystals due to their broken inversion symmetry. Here, we report experimental evidence of piezoelectricity in a free-standing single layer of molybdenum disulphide (MoS\u2082) and a measured piezoelectric coefficient of e\u2081\u2081 =\u20092.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-10)\u2005C\u2005m(-1). The measurement of the intrinsic piezoelectricity in such free-standing crystals is free from substrate effects such as doping and parasitic charges. We observed a finite and zero piezoelectric response in MoS\u2082 in odd and even number of layers, respectively, in sharp contrast to bulk piezoelectric materials. This oscillation is due to the breaking and recovery of the inversion symmetry of the two-dimensional crystal. Through the angular dependence of electromechanical coupling, we determined the two-dimensional crystal orientation. The piezoelectricity discovered in this single molecular membrane promises new applications in low-power logic switches for computing and ultrasensitive biological sensors scaled down to a single atomic unit cell.", "journal": "Nature nanotechnology", "date": "2014-12-23", "authors": ["HanyuZhu", "YuanWang", "JunXiao", "MingLiu", "ShaominXiong", "Zi JingWong", "ZiliangYe", "YuYe", "XiaoboYin", "XiangZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/nnano.2014.309"}

The objective of this study was to determine whether this method can be used to quantify the reduction in uterine size in cows postpartum. Seven healthy pluriparous Holstein Friesian cows (3.7\u00b10.7 yr old, parity 2.4\u00b10.5, mean\u00b1SD) were used. Three weeks before calving, 4 piezoelectric crystals were implanted via laparotomy in the myometrium of the greater curvature of the pregnant uterine horn in a longitudinal direction. Sonometric measurements were conducted daily from 2 d before parturition until 14 d after calving, followed by measurements every other day until d 28. Changes in the distance between neighboring crystals were presented as relative changes (%) from baseline values before parturition. The diameter of the previously pregnant uterine horn was measured using transrectal B-mode sonography from d 10 to 28 after calving. The cows were slaughtered 39\u00b16 d postpartum and the uterus was evaluated for fixation of the crystals. The distances between neighboring crystals underwent changes with a reduction of greater than 50% until d 1 postpartum, but no further changes were recorded from d 1 to 7. In the second week, changes in all distances were affected by day postpartum. One distance was affected by day postpartum in wk 3 and 4. There was a positive correlation between the diameter of the previously pregnant horn and the distances between the crystals. Examination of the uterus after slaughter of the cows revealed that 8 crystals (29%) were no longer fixed in the myometrium. Seven of these (25%) could be evaluated completely or partially and 1 (4%) could not be analyzed.

{"title": "Cancer suppression by compression.", "abstract": "Recent experiments indicate that uniformly compressing a cancer mass at its surface tends to transform many of its cells from proliferative to functional forms. Cancer cells suffer from the Warburg effect, resulting from depleted levels of cell membrane potentials. We show that the compression results in added free energy and that some of the added energy contributes distortional pressure to the cells. This excites the piezoelectric effect on the cell membranes, in particular raising the potentials on the membranes of cancer cells from their depleted levels to near-normal levels. In a sample calculation, a gain of 150 mV in is so attained. This allows the Warburg effect to be reversed. The result is at least partially regained function and accompanying increased molecular order. The transformation remains even when the pressure is turned off, suggesting a change of phase; these possibilities are briefly discussed. It is found that if the pressure is, in particular, applied adiabatically the process obeys the second law of thermodynamics, further validating the theoretical model.", "journal": "Bulletin of mathematical biology", "date": "2014-12-19", "authors": ["B RoyFrieden", "Robert AGatenby"], "doi": "10.1007/s11538-014-0051-7"}

Morphological studies revealed that the TiO2 NPs uniformly deposited as clusters on the surface of the PVDF NF mat. The immobilized amount of TiO2 was found to be 2.08, 2.44, 3.80, and 4.73 mg per 45 cm(2) of PVDF-TiO2 hybrids for the electrospraying of 10, 20, 40, and 60 ml of TiO2-DMF, respectively. The hybrid photocatalysts were effective in degrading bisphenol A (BPA), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), and cimetidine (CMT), which dissolved in both deionized water and secondary wastewater effluents, with activity being proportional to the quantity of TiO2 NPs immobilized. For the highest loading amount of TiO2, BPA, 4-CP, and CMT degraded completely within 100, 100, and 40 min of UV irradiation, respectively. Stable photo-oxidation of CMT was maintained through 10 repeated cycles. During these cycles, it was confirmed that there was no loss of TiO2 NPs by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.

While the latter cause superconductivity by forming a Bose-Einstein-condensate, excitonic condensation is impeded by, for example, a fast radiative decay of the electron-hole pairs. Here, we investigate the behaviour of two electron-hole pairs in a quantum dot with wurtzite crystal structure evoking a charge carrier separation on the basis of large spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations, thus reducing carrier overlap and consequently decay probabilities. As a direct consequence, we find a hybrid-biexciton complex with a water molecule-like charge distribution enabling anomalous spin configurations. In contrast to the conventional-biexciton complex with a net spin of s=0, the hybrid-biexciton exhibits s=\u00b13, leading to completely different photoluminescence signatures in addition to drastically enhanced charge carrier-binding energies. Consequently, the biexcitonic cascade via the dark exciton can be enhanced on the rise of temperature as approved by photon cross-correlation measurements.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["GeraldH\u00f6nig", "GordonCallsen", "AndreiSchliwa", "StefanKalinowski", "ChristianKindel", "SatoshiKako", "YasuhikoArakawa", "DieterBimberg", "AxelHoffmann"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms6721"}

The piezoelectric bimorph showed appropriate static operating range, repeatability, hysteresis, and frequency response for application in lower prosthesis, with a force range of 0-100 N. To further validate this finding, an experiment was conducted with a single transfemoral amputee subject to measure the stump/socket pressure using the piezoelectric bimorph embedded inside the socket. The results showed that a maximum interface pressure of about 27 kPa occurred at the anterior proximal site compared to the anterior distal and posterior sites, consistent with values published in other studies.

{"title": "Epithelial cell-derived periostin functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer through stabilizing p53 and E-cadherin proteins via the Rb/E2F1/p14ARF/Mdm2 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Periostin is usually considered as an oncogene in diverse human cancers, including breast, prostate, colon, esophagus, and pancreas cancers, whereas it acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer. In gastric cancer, it has been demonstrated that periglandular periostin expression is decreased whereas stromal periostin expression is significantly increased as compared with normal gastric tissues. Moreover, periostin produced by stromal myofibroblasts markedly promotes gastric cancer cell growth. These observations suggest that periostin derived from different types of cells may play distinct biological roles in gastric tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the biological functions and related molecular mechanisms of epithelial cell-derived periostin in gastric cancer. Our data showed that periglandular periostin was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues as compared with matched normal gastric mucosa. In addition, its expression in metastatic lymph nodes was significantly lower than that in their primary cancer tissues. Our data also demonstrated that periglandular periostin expression was negatively associated with tumor stage. More importantly, restoration of periostin expression in gastric cancer cells dramatically suppressed cell growth and invasiveness. Elucidation of the mechanisms involved revealed that periostin restoration enhanced Rb phosphorylation and sequentially activated the transcription of E2F1 target gene p14(ARF), leading to Mdm2 inactivation and the stabilization of p53 and E-cadherin proteins. Strikingly, these effects of periostin were abolished upon Rb deletion. Collectively, we have for the first time demonstrated that epithelial cell-derived periostin exerts tumor-suppressor activities in gastric cancer through stabilizing p53 and E-cadherin proteins via the Rb/E2F1/p14(ARF)/Mdm2 signaling pathway.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2014-12-09", "authors": ["HongjunLv", "RuiLiu", "JiaoFu", "QiYang", "JingShi", "PuChen", "MeijuJi", "BingyinShi", "PengHou"], "doi": "10.4161/15384101.2014.947203\n10.3322/caac.20107\n10.3390/cancers5010048\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.01.005\n10.1038/bjc.2012.592\n10.1038/nrc1477\n10.1007/s00018-009-0013-7\n10.1016/S1535-6108(04)00081-9\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0704\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210009\n10.1136/jcp.2007.052506\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0935\n10.1002/ijc.25341\n10.1186/1471-2407-10-273\n10.1002/ijc.21120\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.11.012\n10.1038/nrc745\n10.1038/nrc2718\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2938\n10.1128/MCB.00172-06\n10.1073/pnas.181181198\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.026\n10.1038/25867\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81401-4\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81400-2\n10.1073/pnas.95.14.8292\n10.1038/onc.2012.428\n10.1038/oncsis.2013.17\n10.1038/nrc3447\n10.1055/s-2005-858638\n10.3892/ijo.2012.1530\n10.3892/ijo.2011.997\n10.1016/j.canlet.2009.02.030\n10.1002/ijc.23332\n10.1038/nrc2399\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210803\n10.1074/jbc.M301761200\n10.1016/j.ccr.2007.11.031\n10.1073/pnas.1831408100\n10.1186/1471-2164-10-126\n10.1038/nprot.2006.37\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0036"}

In this study, we have used thin-section transmission electron microscopy to determine the structural consequences of altering the expression of Nup153 in human cells. We show that the assembly and integrity of the nuclear basket is not affected by Nup153 depletion, whereas its integrity is perturbed in cells expressing high concentrations of the zinc-finger domain of Nup153. Moreover, even mild over-expression of Nup153 is coinciding with massive changes in nuclear organization and it is the excess of the zinc-finger domain of Nup153 that is sufficient to induce these rearrangements.

{"title": "A novel ATG4B antagonist inhibits autophagy and has a negative impact on osteosarcoma tumors.", "abstract": "Autophagy has been implicated in the progression and chemoresistance of various cancers. In this study, we have shown that osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells lacking ATG4B, a cysteine proteinase that activates LC3B, are defective in autophagy and fail to form tumors in mouse models. By combining in silico docking with in vitro and cell-based assays, we identified small compounds that suppressed starvation-induced protein degradation, LC3B lipidation, and formation of autophagic vacuoles. NSC185058 effectively inhibited ATG4B activity in vitro and in cells while having no effect on MTOR and PtdIns3K activities. In addition, this ATG4B antagonist had a negative impact on the development of Saos-2 osteosarcoma tumors in vivo. We concluded that tumor suppression was due to a reduction in ATG4B activity, since we found autophagy suppressed within treated tumors and the compound had no effects on oncogenic protein kinases.

They have been found to be reliable for cumulative gamma doses of up to approximately 2 MegaGrays; a brief summary is made of the associated accommodations required to the transducer design, and the ultimate expected failure modes. Outside of the CANDU experience, endurance data have been acquired under a diverse spectrum of operating conditions; this can impede a direct comparison of the information from different sources. Much of this data is associated with transducers immersed in liquid metal coolants associated with advanced reactor designs. Significant modifications to conventional designs have led to the availability of custom transducers that can endure well over 100 MegaGrays of cumulative gamma dose.

{"title": "Flexible piezoelectric thin-film energy harvesters and nanosensors for biomedical applications.", "abstract": "The use of inorganic-based flexible piezoelectric thin films for biomedical applications has been actively reported due to their advantages of highly piezoelectric, pliable, slim, lightweight, and biocompatible properties. The piezoelectric thin films on plastic substrates can convert ambient mechanical energy into electric signals, even responding to tiny movements on corrugated surfaces of internal organs and nanoscale biomechanical vibrations caused by acoustic waves. These inherent properties of flexible piezoelectric thin films enable to develop not only self-powered energy harvesters for eliminating batteries of bio-implantable medical devices but also sensitive nanosensors for in vivo diagnosis/therapy systems. This paper provides recent progresses of flexible piezoelectric thin-film harvesters and nanosensors for use in biomedical fields. First, developments of flexible piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices by using high-quality perovskite thin film and innovative flexible fabrication processes are addressed. Second, their biomedical applications are investigated, including self-powered cardiac pacemaker, acoustic nanosensor for biomimetic artificial hair cells, in vivo energy harvester driven by organ movements, and mechanical sensor for detecting nanoscale cellular deflections.

{"title": "Polymer waveguide Fabry-Perot resonator for high-frequency ultrasound detection.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric technology is the backbone of most medical ultrasound imaging arrays; however, signal transduction efficiency severely deteriorates in scaling the technology to element size smaller than 0.1 mm, often required for high-frequency operation (>20 MHz). Optical sensing and generation of ultrasound has been proposed and studied as an alternative technology for implementing sub-millimeter size arrays with element size down to 10 \u03bcm. The application of thin polymer film Fabry-Perot resonators has been demonstrated for high-frequency ultrasound detection; however, their sensitivity is limited by light diffraction loss. Here, we introduce a new method to increase the sensitivity of an optical ultrasound receiver by utilizing a waveguide between the mirrors of the Fabry-Perot resonator. This approach eliminates diffraction loss from the cavity, and therefore the finesse is only limited by mirror loss and absorption. By applying this method, we have achieved noise equivalent pressure of 178 Pa over a bandwidth of 30 MHz or 0.03 Pa/Hz1/2, which is about 20-fold better than a similar device without a waveguide. The finesse of the tested Fabry-Perot resonator was around 200.

The frequency-dependent elastic modulus of the silicone rubber was modeled by a fourparameter fractional derivative viscoelastic model in the 100 to 250 kHz frequency range. The calculations were carried out in the range of the first radial resonance frequency of the sensor. At the resonance, the hyperelastic effect of the silicone rubber was modeled by a hyperelastic compensating function. The calculated response was matched to the measured response by using the transitional peaks in the impedance spectrum that originates from the switching of standing Lamb wave modes in the silicone rubber. To validate the results, the impedance responses of three 5-mm-thick silicone rubber disks, with different radial lengths, were measured. The calculated and measured transitional frequencies have been compared in detail. The comparison showed very good agreement, with average relative differences of 0.7%, 0.6%, and 0.7% for the silicone rubber samples with radial lengths of 38.0, 21.4, and 11.0 mm, respectively.

Indeed, complicated technological processes leading to very brittle sensing structures are often required to reach high sensitivity when we want to detect specific molecules in biological fields. These developments constitute an obstacle to the early diagnosis of diseases. An alternative is the design of coupled structures. In this study, the device is based on the piezoelectric excitation and detection of two GaAs microstructures vibrating in antisymmetric modes. GaAs is a crystal which has the advantage to be micromachined easily using typical clean room processes. Moreover, we showed its high potential in direct biofunctionalisation for use in the biological field. A specific design of the device was performed to improve the detection at low mass and an original detection method has been developed. The principle is to exploit the variation in amplitude at the initial resonance frequency which has in the vicinity of weak added mass the greatest slope.

PMMA, a mutually miscible polymer to both PVDF and ABS, improved the compatibility between the phases by localizing at the blends interface. This was supported by the core-shell formation with PMMA as the shell and ABS as the core as observed from the SEM micrographs. This phenomenon was strongly contingent on the concentration of PMMA in the blends. This strategy was further extended to localize graphene oxide (GO) sheets at the blends interface by chemically coupling it to PMMA (PMMA-g-GO). A dramatic increment of ca. 84% in the Young's modulus and ca. 124% in the yield strength was observed in the presence of PMMA-g-GO with respect to the neat blends. A simultaneous increment in both the strength and the modulus was observed in the presence of PMMA-g-GO whereas, only addition of GO resulted in a moderate improvement in the yield strength.

Peak strain does not coincide with peak angular displacement during spinal manipulation and cardinal planes of motion. Axial rotation displayed the greatest amount of strain. The greatest amount of strain achieved during spinal manipulation was comparably lower than strains achieved during passive end range motions and previously reported failure limits.\nThe results of this study suggest that vertebral artery strains during head movements including spinal manipulation, do not exceed published failure strains. This study provides new evidence that peak strain in the vertebral artery may not occur at the end range of motion, but rather at some intermediate point during the head and neck motion.", "journal": "Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["Steven LPiper", "Samuel JHowarth", "JohnTriano", "WalterHerzog"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2014.10.004"}

Here, we show that ppk26 (CG8546) plays an important role in mechanical nociception in class IV da neurons. Our immunohistochemical and functional results demonstrate that ppk26 is specifically expressed in class IV da neurons. Larvae with mutant ppk26 showed severe behavioral defects in a mechanical nociception behavioral test but responded to noxious heat stimuli comparably to wild-type larvae. In addition, functional studies suggest that ppk26 and ppk (also called ppk1) function in the same pathway, whereas piezo functions in a parallel pathway. Consistent with these functional results, we found that PPK and PPK26 are interdependent on each other for their cell surface localization. Our work indicates that PPK26 and PPK might form heteromeric DEG/ENaC channels that are essential for mechanotransduction in class IV da neurons.", "journal": "Cell reports", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["YanmengGuo", "YupingWang", "QingxiuWang", "ZuorenWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2014.10.020"}

Mutants lacking Ppk1 and Ppk26 were defective in mechanical, but not thermal, nociception behavior.

Calorimetric measurements are most commonly used for quantifying the dissipated ultrasonic power.

In this work, electrical power measurements were conducted at all locations in the piezoelectric ultrasonic system equipped with \u00bd\u2033 and \u00be\u2033 probes. A set of heat transfer calculations were developed to estimate the convection heat losses from the reaction solution. Chemical dosimeters represented by the oxidation of potassium iodide, Fricke solution and 4-nitrophenol were used to chemically correlate the effect of various electrical amplitudes and treatment regimes. This allowed estimation of sonochemical-efficiency (SE) and energy conversion (XUS) of the ultrasonic system. Results of this study showed overall conversion efficiencies of 60-70%. This correlated well with the chemical dosimeter yield curves of both organic and inorganic aqueous solutions.

Bile acids are natural biological compounds and possess special facial amphiphilic structure with a unusual distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Based on the facial amphiphilicity, cholic acid (CA), one of the bile acids, was utilized for the hydrophilic modification of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) microfiltration membranes via the hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic face of CA and the membrane surfaces. Ethanol, methanol, and water were respectively used as solvent during CA adsorption procedure. Their polarity affects the CA adsorption amount, as similar to CA concentration and adsorption time. There are no changes on the membrane surface morphology after CA adsorption. The hydrophilicity of PVDF membranes is greatly enhanced and the water drops permeates into the CA modified membranes quickly after modification. All these factors benefit to the permeation flux of membrane for water. When CA concentration is higher than 0.088 M, the water permeation flux is doubled as compared with the nascent PVDF membrane and shows a good stability during filtration procedure.

Formation of a pre-polymerization complex of the Nic template with ZnPc-S16 and EtOH-S4 was confirmed by both the high negative Gibbs free energy gain, \u0394G = -115.95 kJ/mol, calculated using the density functional theory at the B3LYP/3-21G* level, and the high stability constant, Ks = 4.67 \u00d7 10(5) M(-1), determined by UV-vis titration in chloroform.

The limit of detection of the CA and PM chemosensing was as low as 40 and 12 \u00b5M, respectively. Among them, the CA chemosensing was more selective to the cotinine and myosmine interferences due to the 1.10 V vs. Ag/AgCl discriminating potential of nicotine electro-oxidation applied.

S(g) due to DP coupling of TA phonons is found to be dominant over all other mechanisms and in the Bloch\u2013Gr\u00fcneisen regime it gives power law S(g) ~ T3. All other mechanisms give S(g) ~ T(5). These power laws are characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) phonons with linear dispersion. Screening enhances the exponent of T by 2 and strongly suppresses S(g) due to the large effective mass of the electrons. We find that S(g), due to screened DP and PE couplings is nearly the same in contrast to the results in GaAs heterojunctions. Also, we predict that S(g) ~ n(s)(-3/2), a characteristic of 2D electrons with parabolic relation. With the increasing (decreasing) T(n(s)) its exponent decreases. For comparison, we give diffusion thermopower S(d). At very low T and high n(s), S(d) ~ T and n(2)(-1). S(d) is found to be greater than S(g) for about T < 2\u20133 K.

Physiologically, articular cartilage sustains millions of cycles of mechanical loading. Chondrocytes, the cells in cartilage, regulate their metabolic activities in response to mechanical loading. Pathological mechanical stress can lead to maladaptive cellular responses and subsequent cartilage degeneration. We sought to deconstruct chondrocyte mechanotransduction by identifying mechanosensitive ion channels functioning at injurious levels of strain. We detected robust expression of the recently identified mechanosensitive channels, PIEZO1 and PIEZO2. Combined directed expression of Piezo1 and -2 sustained potentiated mechanically induced Ca(2+) signals and electrical currents compared with single-Piezo expression. In primary articular chondrocytes, mechanically evoked Ca(2+) transients produced by atomic force microscopy were inhibited by GsMTx4, a PIEZO-blocking peptide, and by Piezo1- or Piezo2-specific siRNA. We complemented the cellular approach with an explant-cartilage injury model.

The rationale behind using either a ferroelectric or a ferromagnetic material in combination with intrinsically conducting nanoparticles (multiwall carbon nanotubes, CNTs), is to induce both electrical and magnetic dipoles in the system. Two key properties, namely, enhanced dielectric constant and magnetic permeability, were determined. PVDF/BT-GO composites exhibited higher dielectric constant compared to PVDF/BT and PVDF/GO composites. Co-NWs, which were synthesized by electrodeposition, exhibited saturation magnetization (Ms) of 40 emu/g and coercivity (Hc) of 300 G. Three phase hybrid composites were prepared by mixing CNTs with either BT-GO or Co-NWs in PVDF by solution blending. These nanoparticles showed high electrical conductivity and significant attenuation of EM radiations both in the X-band and in the Ku-band frequency. In addition, BT-GO/CNT and Co-NWs/CNT particles also enhanced the thermal conductivity of PVDF by ca. 8.7- and 9.3-fold in striking contrast to neat PVDF.

The tensile strength and modulus of the composites increased with the addition of nanoparticles.

Advances in separating the signals produced from contrast agents versus surrounding tissue backscatter provide unique opportunities for specialized sensors designed to image microbubbles with higher signal to noise and resolution than previously possible. In this review article, we describe the background principles and recent developments of ultrasound transducer technology for receiving signals produced by contrast agents while rejecting signals arising from soft tissue.

Transfer characteristics of the hybrid channel GFET clearly indicated that the piezoelectric effect of ZnO NRs under static or dynamic pressure modulated the channel conductivity (\u03c3) and caused a positive shift of 0.25% per kPa in the Dirac point. However, the GFET without ZnO NRs showed no change in either \u03c3 or the Dirac point. Analysis of the Dirac point shifts indicated transfer of electrons from the CVD Gr to ZnO NRs due to modulation of their interfacial barrier height under pressure. High responsiveness of the hybrid channel device with fast response and recovery times was evident in the time-dependent behavior at a small gate bias. In addition, the hybrid channel FET could be gated by mechanical pressurization only. Therefore, a piezoelectric-coupled hybrid channel GFET can be used as a pressure-sensing device with low power consumption and a fast response time.

{"title": "A transmission-line model of back-cavity dynamics for in-plane pressure-differential microphones.", "abstract": "Pressure-differential microphones inspired by the hearing mechanism of a special parasitoid fly have been described previously. The designs employ a beam structure that rotates about two pivots over an enclosed back volume. The back volume is only partially enclosed due to open slits around the perimeter of the beam. The open slits enable incoming sound waves to affect the pressure profile in the microphone's back volume. The goal of this work is to study the net moment applied to pressure-differential microphones by an incoming sound wave, which in-turn requires modeling the acoustic pressure distribution within the back volume. A lumped-element distributed transmission-line model of the back volume is introduced for this purpose. It is discovered that the net applied moment follows a low-pass filter behavior such that, at frequencies below a corner frequency depending on geometrical parameters of the design, the applied moment is unaffected by the open slits. This is in contrast to the high-pass filter behavior introduced by barometric pressure vents in conventional omnidirectional microphones.

The study begins by a physical and analytical analysis of a piezoelectric patch. To preserve the structure's integrity, the transducers are directly pasted onto the surface which leads to a critical issue concerning the interfacing layer. In order to improve the reliability and mitigate the influence of the interfacing layer, the global equations of piezoelectricity are coupled with a load transfer model.

Also, fast imaging is necessary to cover a large surface under investigation in reasonable times. Since AFMs are composed of mechanical components, they are associated with comparably low resonance frequencies that undermine the effort to increase the acquisition rates. In particular, high and steep structures are difficult to follow, which causes the cantilever to temporarily loose contact to or crash into the sample. Here, we report on a novel approach that does not affect the scanner dynamics, but adapts the lateral scanning speed of the scanner. The controller monitors the control error signal and, only when necessary, decreases the scan speed to allow the z-piezo more time to react to changes in the sample's topography. In this case, the overall imaging rate can be significantly increased, because a general scan speed trade-off decision is not needed and smooth areas are scanned fast.

In addition, a characteristic of a ferroelectric is the presence of domains or states with different symmetry equivalent orientations of spontaneous polarization that are switchable with large enough applied electric field, a nonlinear property that makes it useful for applications in nonvolatile memory devices. Central to these properties of a ferroelectric are the phase transitions it undergoes as a function of temperature that involve lowering of the symmetry of its high temperature centrosymmetric paraelectric phase. Ferroelectricity arises from a delicate balance between short and long-range interatomic interactions, and hence the resulting properties are quite sensitive to chemistry, strains, and electric charges associated with its interface with substrate and electrodes. First-principles density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations have been very effective in capturing this and predicting material and environment specific properties of ferroelectrics, leading to fundamental insights into origins of ferroelectricity in oxides and chalcogenides uncovering a precise picture of electronic hybridization, topology, and mechanisms. However, use of DFT in molecular dynamics for detailed prediction of ferroelectric phase transitions and associated temperature dependent properties has been limited due to large length and time scales of the processes involved. To this end, it is quite appealing to start with input from DFT calculations and construct material-specific models that are realistic yet simple for use in large-scale simulations while capturing the relevant microscopic interactions quantitatively. In this Account, we first summarize the insights obtained into chemical mechanisms of ferroelectricity using first-principles DFT calculations. We then discuss the principles of construction of first-principles model Hamiltonians for ferroelectric phase transitions in perovskite oxides, which involve coarse-graining in time domain by integrating out high frequency phonons. Molecular dynamics simulations of the resulting model are shown to give quantitative predictions of material-specific ferroelectric transition behavior in bulk as well as nanoscale ferroelectric structures. A free energy landscape obtained through coarse-graining in real-space provides deeper understanding of ferroelectric transitions, domains, and states with inhomogeneous order and points out the key role of microscopic coupling between phonons and strain. We conclude with a discussion of the multiscale modeling strategy elucidated here and its application to other materials such as shape memory alloys.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2014-11-02", "authors": ["Umesh VWaghmare"], "doi": "10.1021/ar500331c"}

Drosophila larvae display defecation cycles of stereotypic frequency, involving sequential contraction of hindgut and anal sphincter. The defecation behavior requires two groups of motor neurons that innervate hindgut and anal sphincter, respectively, and can excite gut muscles directly. These two groups of motor neurons fire sequentially with the same periodicity as the defecation behavior, as revealed by in vivo Ca(2+) imaging.

{"title": "Hydrogen peroxide mechanosynthesis in siloxane-hydrogel contact lenses.", "abstract": "Drug-loaded contact lenses are emerging as the preferred treatment method for several ocular diseases, and efforts are being directed to promote extended and controlled delivery. One strategy is based on delivery induced by environmental triggers. One of these triggers can be hydrogen peroxide, since many platforms based on drug-loaded nanoparticles were demonstrated to be hydrogen-peroxide responsive. This is particularly interesting when hydrogen peroxide is the result of a specific pathophysiological condition. Otherwise, an alternative route to induce drug delivery is here proposed, namely the mechano-synthesis. The present work represents the proof-of-concept of the mechanosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide in siloxane-hydrogel contact lenses as a consequence of the cleavage of siloxane bonds at the interface between the polymer and water in aqueous phase. Their spongy morphology makes contact lenses promising systems for mechanical-to-chemical energy conversion, since the amount of hydrogen peroxide is expected to scale with the interfacial area between the polymer and water. The eyelid pressure during wear is sufficient to induce the hydrogen peroxide synthesis with concentrations which are biocompatible and suitable to trigger the drug release through hydrogen-peroxide-responsive platforms. For possible delivery on demand, the integration of piezoelectric polymers in the siloxane-hydrogel contact lenses could be designed, whose mechanical deformation could be induced by an applied wireless-controlled voltage.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2014-10-31", "authors": ["SilviaTavazzi", "LorenzoFerraro", "FedericaCozza", "ValentinaPastori", "MarziaLecchi", "StefanoFarris", "AlessandroBorghesi"], "doi": "10.1021/am503940p"}

Here we review the first decade of research on BiFeO3 films, restricting ourselves to epitaxial structures. We discuss how thickness and epitaxial strain influence not only the unit cell parameters, but also the crystal structure, illustrated for instance by the discovery of the so-called T-like phase of BiFeO3.

{"title": "Cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptor antagonists prevent attenuation of serotonin-induced reflex apneas by dronabinol in Sprague-Dawley rats.", "abstract": "The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in Americans is 9% and increasing. Increased afferent vagal activation may predispose to OSA by reducing upper airway muscle activation/patency and disrupting respiratory rhythmogenesis. Vagal afferent neurons are inhibited by cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) or cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptors in animal models of vagally-mediated behaviors. Injections of dronabinol, a non-selective CB1/CB2 receptor agonist, into the nodose ganglia reduced serotonin (5-HT)-induced reflex apneas. It is unknown what role CB1 and/or CB2 receptors play in reflex apnea. Here, to determine the independent and combined effects of activating CB1 and/or CB2 receptors on dronabinol's attenuating effect, rats were pre-treated with CB1 (AM251) and/or CB2 (AM630) receptor antagonists. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized, instrumented with bilateral electrodes to monitor genioglossus electromyogram (EMGgg) and a piezoelectric strain gauge to monitor respiratory pattern. Following intraperitoneal treatment with AM251 and/or AM630, or with vehicle, serotonin was intravenously infused into a femoral vein to induce reflex apnea. After baseline recordings, the nodose ganglia were exposed and 5-HT-induced reflex apneas were again recorded to confirm that the nerves remained functionally intact. Dronabinol was injected into each nodose ganglion and 5-HT infusion was repeated. Prior to dronabinol injection, there were no significant differences in 5-HT-induced reflex apneas or phasic and tonic EMGgg before or after surgery in the CB1, CB2, combined CB1/CB2 antagonist, and vehicle groups. In the vehicle group, dronabinol injections reduced 5-HT-induced reflex apnea duration. In contrast, dronabinol injections into nodose ganglia of the CB1, CB2, and combined CB1/CB2 groups did not attenuate 5-HT-induced reflex apnea duration. However, the CB1 and CB2 antagonists had no effect on dronabinol's ability to increase phasic EMGgg.

{"title": "Stochastic nanoroughness modulates neuron-astrocyte interactions and function via mechanosensing cation channels.", "abstract": "Extracellular soluble signals are known to play a critical role in maintaining neuronal function and homeostasis in the CNS. However, the CNS is also composed of extracellular matrix macromolecules and glia support cells, and the contribution of the physical attributes of these components in maintenance and regulation of neuronal function is not well understood. Because these components possess well-defined topography, we theorize a role for topography in neuronal development and we demonstrate that survival and function of hippocampal neurons and differentiation of telencephalic neural stem cells is modulated by nanoroughness. At roughnesses corresponding to that of healthy astrocytes, hippocampal neurons dissociated and survived independent from astrocytes and showed superior functional traits (increased polarity and calcium flux). Furthermore, telencephalic neural stem cells differentiated into neurons even under exogenous signals that favor astrocytic differentiation. The decoupling of neurons from astrocytes seemed to be triggered by changes to astrocyte apical-surface topography in response to nanoroughness. Blocking signaling through mechanosensing cation channels using GsMTx4 negated the ability of neurons to sense the nanoroughness and promoted decoupling of neurons from astrocytes, thus providing direct evidence for the role of nanotopography in neuron-astrocyte interactions. We extrapolate the role of topography to neurodegenerative conditions and show that regions of amyloid plaque buildup in brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients are accompanied by detrimental changes in tissue roughness.

Because of the comprehensive effect of \"salt bridge\" and electrical neutralization, there was a transition from increase to decrease for the adhesion forces of membrane-HA and HA-HA as the doses of calcium ions increased. In all cases, both of membrane-HA and HA-HA adhesion forces had the same variation tendency, which displayed a good correlation with the flux decline trends during fouling experiments, respectively, and provided certain theoretical support to further understand the formation mechanism of membrane fouling.", "journal": "Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue", "date": "2014-10-24", "authors": ["LeiWang", "LeiWang", "Dan-XiHuang", "Xu-DongWang"], "doi": null}

How to use and detect this field has been an ongoing topic over the past few decades. Conventional magnetic sensors are usually based on the Hall Effect, the fluxgate, a superconductor quantum interface or magnetoelectric or magnetoresistive sensing. Here, a flexible, simple, low-cost and self-powered active piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) is successfully demonstrated as an AC magnetic field sensor at room temperature. The amplitude and frequency of a magnetic field can both be accurately sensed by the NG. The output voltage of the NG has a good linearity with a measured magnetic field. The detected minute magnetic field is as low as 1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-7) tesla, which is 400 times greater than a commercial magnetic sensor that uses the Hall Effect. In comparison to the existing technologies, an NG is a room-temperature self-powered active sensor that is very simple and very cheap for practical applications.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2014-10-22", "authors": ["AifangYu", "MingSong", "YanZhang", "JinzongKou", "JunyiZhai", "ZhongLin Wang"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/25/45/455503"}

Different from traditional AFOC, the new structure is based on flexible hinges to drive the fiber end cap instead of naked fiber. We fabricated a real AFOC based on flexible hinges, and the end cap's deviation and resonance frequency of the device were measured. Experimental results show that this new AFOC can provide fast control of tip-tilt deviation of the laser beam emitting from the end cap. As a result, the fiber end cap can support much higher power than naked fiber, which makes the new structure ideal for tip-tilt controlling in a high-power fiber laser system.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2014-10-17", "authors": ["DongZhi", "YanxingMa", "PengfeiMa", "LeiSi", "XiaolinWang", "PuZhou"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.53.005434"}

Past work on these copolymers has been done with limited emphasis on the effects of copolymer composition and with a limited range of defect monomers, focusing primarily on the commercially available poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene), P(VDF-CTFE), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), P(VDF-HFP), and the processing thereof. To expand on this area of research, copolymers of VDF and bromotrifluoroethylene (BTFE) were synthesized examining the composition range where uniaxial stretching was possible. It is found that P(VDF-BTFE) copolymers with small BTFE contents (< 2 mol %) stabilize the \u03b3 phase, compared to P(VDF-CTFE)s and P(VDF-HFP)s that are largely \u03b1 phase in composition. Furthermore, different from P(VDF-CTFE)s and P(VDF-HFP)s, whose energy storage capabilities depend on the reversibility of the \u03b1 to \u03b2 phases transformation, high discharged energy densities (i.e., 20.8 J/cm(3) at 716 MV/m) are also achievable through the \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases in P(VDF-BTFE)s without significantly reducing crystallinity and breakdown strength.

The aim of this study was to develop a true size measuring system (TSM system) on magnified pinhole thyroid scan using an ultrasonic sensor.\nAn ultrasonic device capable of measuring the distance from the pinhole to the skin overlying the thyroid gland was manufactured using a ~40 kHz piezoelectric-transducer-based sensor, and its accuracy was tested. An interface program was developed and fused with the ultrasonic device for development of the TSM system. Accuracy of the TSM system for measuring size was tested with phantom images and 35 thyroid scans.\nThe ultrasonic device accurately measured the distance from the pinhole to the skin over the thyroid gland and the measured values were highly reproducible (6 cm; 6.02 \u00b1 0.04 cm, 8 cm; 8.00 \u00b1 0.05 cm, 10 cm; 10.00 \u00b1 0.05 cm). Distance on the phantom image corrected by the TSM system was almost the same as the true distance. Size of the thyroid on the pinhole image was larger (+67.3 to 103.1 %) than the true thyroid size on the parallel-hole image and the magnification decreased by increase of the distance between the pinhole and the skin over the thyroid gland. However, size of the thyroid obtained using the TSM system was almost equal (-2.1 to +3.6 %) to the true thyroid size on the parallel-hole image.\nWe developed the TSM system for magnified pinhole images using a distance measuring ultrasonic sensor. Size of the thyroid on the magnified pinhole image obtained using the system was almost the same as the true thyroid size.

{"title": "Piezoelectricity of single-atomic-layer MoS2 for energy conversion and piezotronics.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric characteristics of nanowires, thin films and bulk crystals have been closely studied for potential applications in sensors, transducers, energy conversion and electronics. With their high crystallinity and ability to withstand enormous strain, two-dimensional materials are of great interest as high-performance piezoelectric materials. Monolayer MoS2 is predicted to be strongly piezoelectric, an effect that disappears in the bulk owing to the opposite orientations of adjacent atomic layers. Here we report the first experimental study of the piezoelectric properties of two-dimensional MoS2 and show that cyclic stretching and releasing of thin MoS2 flakes with an odd number of atomic layers produces oscillating piezoelectric voltage and current outputs, whereas no output is observed for flakes with an even number of layers. A single monolayer flake strained by 0.53% generates a peak output of 15\u00a0mV and 20\u00a0pA, corresponding to a power density of 2\u00a0mW\u00a0m(-2) and a 5.08% mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the output increases with decreasing thickness and reverses sign when the strain direction is rotated by 90\u00b0. Transport measurements show a strong piezotronic effect in single-layer MoS2, but not in bilayer and bulk MoS2.

{"title": "Application of piezoelectric nanogenerator in medicine: bio-experiment and theoretical exploration.", "abstract": "A large number of wearable and implantable electronic medical devices are widely used in clinic and playing an increasingly important role in diagnosis and treatment, but the limited battery capacity restricts their service life and function expansion. Piezoelectric nanogenerators can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Our experiment tries to find out if the piezoelectric nanogenerator fixed to the surface of the heart can convert the natural contractions and relaxations of the heart into stable electric energy for electronic medical devices such as pacemakers.\nWe used Chinese miniature pig and prepared with standard open chest procedure. Then we fixed two opposite edges of the rectangular nanogenerator at the following three positions of the heart respectively to detect the electric voltage output: Position A, right ventricular surface, near the atrioventricular groove, parallel to the long axis of the heart; Position B, right ventricular surface, parallel to the atrioventricular groove; and Position C, left ventricular surface, near cardiac apex, parallel to the left anterior descending branch. Then we selected the place which has the highest voltage output to fix both ends of the nanogenerator and closed the chest of pig. We recorded the voltage output of nanogenerator under closed chest condition (natural condition) and compared the result with open chest condition. Finally we used Dopamine (positive inotropic agents) and Esmolol (negative inotropic agents) respectively to detect the relation between voltage output of nanogenerator and myocardial contractility.\nWith its both ends fixed on the surface of the heart, the piezoelectric nanogenerator produced stable voltage output from the mechanical contractions of the heart. Piezoelectric nanogenerator which was fixed at Position A produced the highest voltage output (3.1 V), compared with those fixed at Position B or Position C. The voltage is enough for the pacemaker's operation. The voltage output of piezoelectric nanogenerator at the natural condition (closed chest) was the same as the open chest condition and made a light emitting diode (LED) light continue to shine, which further confirmed its clinical application value. The voltage output of piezoelectric nanogenerator is positively correlated with the myocardial contractile force. The voltage output increased after we used positive inotropic agents and decreased after we used negative inotropic agents.\nPiezoelectric nanogenerators can convert the kinetic energy of the heart during the contractions and relaxations of the muscles to electric energy. The output voltage was stable in three positions on the surface of the heart. The highest voltage appeared on the surface of right ventricle, near atrioventricular groove, parallel to the long axis direction of the heart, which can be the potential new energy source for pacemakers.

Here, we demonstrate the use of an integrated acoustically driven microfluidic mixing scheme to enhance detection of a chemiluminescent species tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate-a common chemiluminescent reagent widely used for the analysis of a wide range of compounds such as illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides-such that rapid in-line quantification can be carried out with sufficient on-chip sensitivity. Specifically, we employ surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to drive intense chaotic streaming within a 100 \u03bcL chamber cast in polydimethoxylsiloxane (PDMS) atop a microfluidic chip consisting of a single crystal piezoelectric material. By optimizing the power, duration, and orientation of the SAW input, we show that the mixing intensity of the sample and reagent fed into the chamber can be increased by one to two orders of magnitude, leading to a similar enhancement in the detection sensitivity of the chemiluminescent species and thus achieving a theoretical limit of detection of 0.02 ppb (0.2 nM) of l-proline-a decade improvement over the industry gold-standard and two orders of magnitude more sensitive than that achievable with conventional systems-simply using a portable photodetector and without requiring sample preconcentration.

{"title": "Enhanced cycle performance of lithium-sulfur batteries using a separator modified with a PVDF-C layer.", "abstract": "High energy density Li-S batteries are highly attractive. However, their use in practical applications has been greatly affected by their poor cycle life and low rate performance, which can be partly attributed to the dissolution of polysulfides from the S cathode and their migration to the Li anode through the separator. While much effort has been devoted to designing the structure of the S cathodes for suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides, relatively little emphasis has been placed on modifying the separator. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach for modifying the separator with a polyvinylidene fluoride-carbon (PVDF-C) layer, where the polysulfides generated in the Li-S cells can be localized on the cathode side. Li-S batteries based on the novel separator and a cathode prepared by the simple mixing of a S powder and super P have delivered discharge capacities of 918.6 mAh g(-1), 827.2 mAh g(-1), and 669.1 mAh g(-1) after 100, 200, and 500 cycles, respectively, at a discharge rate of 0.5 C. Even under current densities of up to 5 C, the cells were able to retain a discharge capacity of 393 mAh g(-1), thereby demonstrating an excellent high rate performance and stability. The exceptional electrochemical performance could be attributed to the intense adsorption capability of the micropores, presence of C-C double bonds, and conductivity of the C network in the PVDF-C layer. This economical and simple strategy to overcome the polysulfide dissolution issues provides a commercially feasible method for the construction of Li-S batteries.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2014-10-03", "authors": ["HangWei", "JinMa", "BiaoLi", "YuxuanZuo", "DingguoXia"], "doi": "10.1021/am505807k"}

Numerous anatomical and surgical advancements in sinus lift surgery are still inspiring clinicians.\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the recent trends in sinus lift surgery focusing on implant survival, bone grafting, anatomical and surgical considerations, and their clinical implications on the practice of implant dentistry in atrophic posterior maxilla.\nWe performed an extensive search in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Trip, Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. Articles were critically reviewed to determine the level of evidence as per the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.\nComprehensive assessment of sinus septa, sinus pathology, and bone quality and quantity using three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography radiographs is important before placing implants in posterior maxilla. With a residual bone height of less than 5\u2009mm, the survival rate of implant decreases substantially. Lateral window approach can increase the vertical bone height to greater than 9\u2009mm, while osteotome approach can increase this height from 3 to 9\u2009mm. The perforation of Schneiderian membrane doubles the risk for the incidence of sinusitis or infection. The use of piezoelectric surgery allows adequate sinus lift while protecting soft tissues and minimizing patient discomfort.\nAlthough both osteotome and lateral window procedures can help clinicians in overcoming the challenges of placing implants in atrophic posterior maxilla, pre-implant residual bone height is crucial in determining the survival of these implants.

This paper presents the development of a parallelogram-based compliant RCM stage for active parallel alignment. Different from conventional parallelogram-based RCM mechanism, the proposed stage is designed with compliant mechanisms, which endows the stage with many attractive merits when used in precision micro-/nanomanipulations. A symmetric double-parallelogram mechanism (SDPM) based on flexure hinges is developed as the rotary guiding component to realize desired RCM function. Due to the geometrical constraint of the SDPM, the operating space of the stage can be easily adjusted by bending the input links without loss of rotational precision. The stage is driven by a piezoelectric actuator and its output motion is measured by non-contact displacement sensors. Based on pseudo-rigid-body simplification method, the analytical models predicting kinematics, statics, and dynamics of the RCM stage have been established. Besides, the dimensional optimization is conducted in order to maximize the first resonance frequency of the stage. After that, finite element analysis is conducted to validate the established models and the prototype of the stage is fabricated for performance tests. The experimental results show that the developed RCM stage has a rotational range of 1.45 mrad while the maximum center shift of the RCM point is as low as 1 \u03bcm, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2014-10-03", "authors": ["JianliangQu", "WeihaiChen", "JianbinZhang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4895680"}

To make this realistic, not only does the throughput of this method need to be increased, but also the components should be inert to pharmaceutical preparations.

To achieve this, inkjet devices from glass capillary tubes were manufactured with orifice diameters of 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcm and were actuated with diaphragm piezoelectric disks. Also, a pressure capsule was formed by creating a manifold at a distance from the orifice tip. Placing the piezoelectric disk at 0.5 mm distance from the tip allowed the formation of a jet at 3.2 MHz in certain designs, but for a short period of time because of overheating. The length of the pressure capsule, its inlet diameter, and the nozzle tip geometry were crucial to lower the required power. Actuating an inkjet device with 10 \u03bcm orifice diameter comfortably at 900 kHz and drying the droplets from 1% salbutamol sulphate solution allowed the formation of particles with diameters of 1.76 \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcm and the geometric standard deviation of 1.08.

In light of our recent findings, we understood that the origin of these molecular relaxations were strongly contingent on the concentration of PMMA in the blend, crystalline morphology and the surface functional moieties on multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In addition, for the blends with concentration of PMMA \u2265 25 wt%, the structural relaxations often merge and are dielectrically indistinguishable. In this study, we attempted to determine the critical width in composition where the structural relaxations can be distinctly realized both in the control as well as blends with amine functionalized CNTs (NH2-CNTs). Intriguingly, we observed that in a narrow zone in composition (with PMMA concentration \u2265 10 wt% and \u226425 wt%), the molecular relaxations can be dielectrically distinguished and they often merge for all other compositions. Furthermore, we attempted to understand how this critical width in composition is related to the crystalline morphology using small angle X-ray scattering and polarizing optical microscopy and the crystal structure using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. We now understand that although the formation of \u03b2 crystals in the blends has no direct correlation with the observed molecular relaxations, the amorphous miscibility and the interphase regions seem to be dictating the origin of different molecular relaxations in the blends.

PMUT arrays with rectangular apertures containing 256 and 512 active elements were fabricated and operated at 5 MHz. The arrays were bulk micromachined in silicon-on-insulator substrates, and contained flexural unimorph membranes comprising the device silicon, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and electrode layers. Through-silicon interconnects were fabricated by depositing a thin-film conformal copper layer in the bulk micromachined via under each PMUT membrane and photolithographically patterning this copper layer on the back of the substrate to facilitate contact with the individually addressable matrix array elements. Cable assemblies containing insulated 45-AWG copper wires and a termination silicon substrate were thermocompression bonded to the PMUT substrate for signal wire interconnection to the PMUT array. Side-viewing 14-Fr catheters were fabricated and introduced through the femoral vein in an adult porcine model.

{"title": "Automatic optimal input command for linearization of cMUT output by a temporal target.", "abstract": "Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (cMUTs) are a promising alternative to the piezoelectric transducer. However, their native nonlinear behavior is a limitation for their use in medical ultrasound applications. Several methods based on the pre-compensation of a preselected input voltage have been proposed to cancel out the harmonic components generated. Unfortunately, these existing pre-compensation methods have two major flaws. The first is that the pre-compensation procedure is not generally automatic, and the second is that they can only reduce the second harmonic component. This can, therefore, limit their use for some imaging methods, which require a broader bandwidth, e.g., to receive the third harmonic component. In this study, we generalized the presetting methods to reduce all nonlinearities in the cMUT output. Our automatic pre-compensation method can work whatever the excitation waveform. The precompensation method is based on the nonlinear modeling of harmonic components from a Volterra decomposition in which the parameters are evaluated by using a Nelder-Mead algorithm. To validate the feasibility of this approach, the method was applied to an element of a linear array with several types of excitation often encountered in encoded ultrasound imaging.

These subtle and subclinical age-related changes make older adults more vulnerable to dysphagia during disease insults. However, there are limited studies of the swallowing process in older adults, because measurements are typically invasive or require exposure to X-rays. In the present study, we used integrated non-invasive measurements to determine aging-related changes of swallowing, and in the coordination of swallowing and respiration for a population of healthy participants.\nThe non-invasive system provided measurements of larynx movement with piezoelectric sensors, submental muscle activity with surface electromyography and respiration-swallowing coordination by measurement of nasal airflow. We recruited 112 healthy participants from the community, 35 in a young-age group (age 20-30\u2009years), 38 in a middle-age group (age 31-50\u2009years) and 39 in an old-age group (age 51-70\u2009years).\nThe oropharyngeal swallowing parameters of the old-age group had delayed onset latency and longer swallowing apnea duration relative to the other groups, and these differences were greater for larger boluses. The middle- and old-age groups had less expiratory-expiratory respiratory phase pattern than the young-age group. The probability of piecemeal deglutition was highest in the old-age group and lowest in the young-age group.

In many practical applications, contact measurements are cumbersome or not possible, and air-coupled ultrasound can provide a solution. This paper presents air-coupled ultrasonic through-transmission measurements on a steel plate with thicknesses 10.15 mm; 10.0 mm; 9.8 mm. Ultrasound pulses were transmitted from a piezoelectric transducer at normal incidence, through the steel plate, and were received at the opposite side. The S1, A2 and A3 modes of the plate are excited, with resonance frequencies that depend on the material properties and the thickness of the plate. The results show that the resonances could be clearly identified after transmission through the steel plate, and that the frequencies of the resonances could be used to distinguish between the three plate thicknesses. The S1-mode resonance was observed to be shifted 10% down compared to a simple plane wave half-wave resonance model, while the A2 and S2 modes were found approximately at the corresponding plane-wave resonance frequencies. A model based on the angular spectrum method was used to predict the response of the through-transmission setup.

A brief reminder about perfluoroalkyl chains, fluorocarbons and fluorosurfactants is provided. The outstanding, otherwise unattainable physicochemical properties and combinations thereof of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are outlined, including extreme hydrophobic and lipophobic character; thermal and chemical stability in extreme conditions; remarkable aptitude to self-assemble into sturdy thin repellent protecting films; unique spreading, dispersing, emulsifying, anti-adhesive and levelling, dielectric, piezoelectric and optical properties, leading to numerous industrial and technical uses and consumer products. It was eventually discovered, however, that PFASs with seven or more carbon-long perfluoroalkyl chains had disseminated in air, water, soil and biota worldwide, are persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative in animals and humans, raising serious health and environmental concerns. Further use of long-chain PFASs is environmentally not sustainable. Most leading manufacturers have turned to shorter four to six carbon perfluoroalkyl chain products that are not considered bioaccumulative. However, many of the key performances of PFASs decrease sharply when fluorinated chains become shorter. Fluorosurfactants become less effective and less efficient, provide lesser barrier film stability, etc. On the other hand, they remain as persistent in the environment as their longer chain homologues. Surprisingly little data (with considerable discrepancies) is accessible on the physicochemical properties of the PFASs under examination, a situation that requires consideration and rectification. Such data are needed for understanding the environmental and in vivo behaviour of PFASs. They should help determine which, for which uses, and to what extent, PFASs are environmentally sustainable.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2014-09-24", "authors": ["Marie PierreKrafft", "Jean GRiess"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.039"}

The addition of the two LDHs significantly improved, in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE), over the plain poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) gelled electrolyte and competed favorably with the liquid electrolyte based DSSCs, 8.13% for the liquid electrolyte, 7.48% for the plain PVDF-HFP gelled electrolyte, 8.11% for the ZnAl-CO3 LDH/PVDF-HFP gelled electrolyte, and 8.00% for the ZnAl-Cl LDH/PVDF-HFP gelled electrolyte based DSSCs.

In particular, the obtained results reveal that, like in the case of isotropic solids, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient first increases with the fillet radius to wavelength ratio r/\u03bb, reaches a maximum at r/\u03bb\u22480.3-0.5, and then decreases tending to zero. The magnitude of the transmission coefficient across the rounded corner first decreases, reaches a minimum at r/\u03bb\u22480.3-0.5, and then increases up to a value around which it slightly oscillates as r/\u03bb increases. It is demonstrated that if the substrate is anisotropic, then in the general case a SAW is scattered off differently at the right-hand border and the left-hand border. The difference between the \"right-hand\" and \"left-hand\" transformation coefficients can be very substantial. Computations for YZ LiNbO3 illustrate possible levels of the anisotropy of the scattering for mutually reverse directions of incidence. It is shown that if the substrate is specially oriented, then the scattering from the right-hand border is identical to the scattering from the left-hand border. There are four types of such orientations. Examples of the specially oriented substrates are 128\u00b0YX LiNbO3 and ST-X SiO2.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2014-09-23", "authors": ["A NDarinskii", "MWeihnacht", "HSchmidt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2014.08.012"}

A descriptive study was designed for patients operated on between November 2012 and January 2014. All the patients presented some type of skeletal anomaly and underwent orthognatic surgery via piezoelectric osteotomies. Each maxillary surgery was developed with that system and those patients who also received osteotomies with a reciprocating saw were excluded. Surgical time and complications were analyzed. 19 patients underwent surgery consecutively with an osteotomy average time of 45 minutes. The patients operated on at the beginning were longer surgeries, whereas the final cases were 40 minutes. No type of laceration of vascular elements or laceration of palatal tissue was observed. The protocol was fully implemented, incorporating all the advantages of piezoelectric systems. It is concluded that the LeFort I segmented osteotomy can be performed with low risk of injuring soft tissues and in a time probably less than 50 minutes for the maxillary osteotomy.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental medicine", "date": "2014-09-19", "authors": ["SergioOlate", "LeandroPozzer", "AlejandroUnibazo", "ClaudioHuentequeo-Molina", "FelipeMartinez", "M\u00e1rciode Moraes"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Calcium entry into stereocilia drives adaptation of the mechanoelectrical transducer current of mammalian cochlear hair cells.", "abstract": "Mechanotransduction in the auditory and vestibular systems depends on mechanosensitive ion channels in the stereociliary bundles that project from the apical surface of the sensory hair cells. In lower vertebrates, when the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels are opened by movement of the bundle in the excitatory direction, Ca(2+) entry through the open MET channels causes adaptation, rapidly reducing their open probability and resetting their operating range. It remains uncertain whether such Ca(2+)-dependent adaptation is also present in mammalian hair cells. Hair bundles of both outer and inner hair cells from mice were deflected by using sinewave or step mechanical stimuli applied using a piezo-driven fluid jet. We found that when cochlear hair cells were depolarized near the Ca(2+) reversal potential or their hair bundles were exposed to the in vivo endolymphatic Ca(2+) concentration (40 \u00b5M), all manifestations of adaptation, including the rapid decline of the MET current and the reduction of the available resting MET current, were abolished. MET channel adaptation was also reduced or removed when the intracellular Ca(2+) buffer 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) was increased from a concentration of 0.1 to 10 mM. The findings show that MET current adaptation in mouse auditory hair cells is modulated similarly by extracellular Ca(2+), intracellular Ca(2+) buffering, and membrane potential, by their common effect on intracellular free Ca(2+).", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-09-18", "authors": ["Laura FCorns", "Stuart LJohnson", "Corn\u00e9 JKros", "WalterMarcotti"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1409920111"}

Four functional groups predominated in OSPW (amine, phosphoryl, carboxyl and hydroxyl) as indicated by the linear programming method. The nylon membranes were the most hydrophilic and exhibited the lowest AEF removal at pH of 8.7. However, the adsorption of AEF on the membranes increased as the pH of OSPW decreased due to hydrophobic interactions between the membrane surfaces and the protonated molecules. The use of ultra pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS) showed insignificant adsorption of NAs on the tested membranes at pH 8.7. However, 26\u00b12.4% adsorption of NAs was observed at pH 5.3 following the protonation of NAs species. For the nylon membrane, excessive carboxylic acids in the commercial NAs caused the formation of negatively charged assisted hydrogen bonds, resulting in increased adsorption at pH 8.2 (25%) as compared to OSPW (0%).

Horizontally aligned ZnO microrod arrays with uniform orientation and periodic distribution can be realized based on the conventional bottom-up method prepared vertically aligned ZnO microrod matrix via the combing method. When the combing parameters are changed, the orientation of horizontally aligned ZnO microrod arrays can be adjusted (\u03b8 = 90\u00b0 or 45\u00b0) in a plane and a misalignment angle of the microrods (0.3\u00b0 to 2.3\u00b0) with low-growth density can be obtained.

{"title": "Photoacoustic radiation force on a microbubble.", "abstract": "We investigate the radiation force on a microbubble due to the photoacoustic wave which is generated by using a pulsed laser. In particular, we focus on the dependence of pulsed laser parameters on the radiation force. In order to do so, we first obtain a new and comprehensive analytical solution to the photoacoustic wave equation based on the Fourier transform for various absorption profiles. Then, we write an expression of the radiation force containing explicit laser parameters, pulse duration, and beamwidth of the laser. Furthermore, we calculate the primary radiation force acting on a microbubble. We show that laser parameters and the position of the microbubble relative to a photoacoustic source have a considerable effect on the primary radiation force. By means of recent developments in laser technologies that render tunability of pulse duration and repetition frequency possible, an adjustable radiation force can be applied to microbubbles. High spatial control of applied force is ensured on account of smaller focal spots achievable by focused optics. In this context, conventional piezoelectric acoustic source applications could be surpassed. In addition, it is possible to increase the radiation force by making source wavelength with the absorption peak of absorber concurrent. The application of photoacoustic radiation force can open a cache of opportunities such as manipulation of microbubbles used as contrast agents and as carrier vehicles for drugs and genes with a desired force along with in vivo applications.", "journal": "Physical review.

Fully ordered crystals in this class, such as Ca3TaGa3Si2O14 (CTGS), have been suggested as offering the potential of electroacoustic performance that is superior to more extensively studied langasite (LGS) and langatate (LGT), which are partially disordered. In this study, the resonant frequencies, acoustic damping, and electrical conductivity of CTGS bulk acoustic resonators with Y-cut and (YXl)-30\u00b0 crystal orientations and fundamental frequencies near 5 MHz are investigated at temperatures between ambient and 1100\u00b0C. (YXl)-30\u00b0 resonators are found to have turnover temperatures near 200\u00b0C for the third and fifth overtones, in contrast to a monotonic decrease in resonant frequencies of Y-cut crystals with increasing temperature. The maximum temperature derivative of fractional changes in fifth-overtone frequency of (YXl)-30\u00b0 CTGS is 40 \u00d7 10-6K-1 (near 1100\u00b0C), and this value is not greatly different from the temperature derivative of Y-cut CTGS frequencies over a broader range of temperatures. At ambient temperatures, the acoustic loss Q-1 of CTGS with both crystal orientations is found to be greater than the lowest values previously reported for LGS and LGT. The electrical conductivity of the CTGS specimens between 500\u00b0C and 1100\u00b0C is substantially lower than that previously reported for LGS. Corresponding to this lower conductivity, the piezoelectric/conductive contribution to Q-1 at elevated temperatures is reduced.

The coherent structural resonances were able to drive particles (yeast cells) in the water to nodes throughout the chamber. Ultrasound enhanced sedimentation was used to demonstrate the efficiency of the system (>99% particle clearance). Sub-wavelength pin protrusions were used for the contacts between the resonant chamber and other elements. The pins provided support and transferred power, replacing glue which is inefficient for power transfer. Filtration energies of \u223c4 J/ml of suspension were measured. A calculation of thermal convection indicates that the circulation could disrupt cell alignment in ducts >35 mm high when a 1K temperature gradient is present; we predict higher efficiencies when this maximum height is observed. For the acoustic design, although modelling was minimal before construction, the very simple construction allowed us to form 3D models of the nodal patterns in the fluid and the duct structure.

In brief, a square rod shaft is axially spring-clamped on the inner wall of a metal tube which is glued inside the free end of the PTS. The shaft can thus be driven by the PTS to realize image scan and inertial stepping coarse approach. To enhance the inertial force, each of the four outer electrodes of the PTS is driven by an independent port of the controller. The MFM scan head is so compact that it can easily fit into the 52mm low temperature bore of a 20T superconducting magnet.

There were 66 lessons throughout the semester. MVPA was monitored during each lesson using NL-1000 piezoelectric pedometers.

A population averaged generalized estimating equation was employed to examine MVPA trajectories.\nOn average, students' MVPA decreased over time (\u03b2 = -0.35, P < .001). Poor student VO2max classification significantly modified the trajectories (\u03b2 = -0.14, P < .001), however poor BMI classification did not have a modifying effect (\u03b2 = 0.03, P = .158).\nMVPA decreased in daily PE over time and cardiorespiratory endurance significantly modified the trajectories.

However, previous researches seldom consider the focal resolution, whose focal size is much larger than one wavelength. Furthermore, there is to date no such design method of PTs that allows a large degree of freedom to achieve designed focal patterns. Here, an active and configurable planar metasurface PT prototype is proposed to manipulate the acoustic focal pattern and the focal resolution freely. By suitably optimized ring configurations of the active metasurface PT, we demonstrate the manipulation of focal patterns in acoustic far fields, such as the designed focal needle and multi foci. Our method is also able to manipulate and improve the cross-sectional focal resolution from subwavelength to the extreme case: the deep sub-diffraction-limit resolution. Via the acoustic Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral (RSI) cum the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), the free manipulation of focusing properties is achieved in acoustics for the first time.

In solid-solutions, the changes occurring in atomic scale are very complex since the short- and long-range order are different. Standard methods used in diffraction data analysis fail to model the short-range order accurately. Pressure-induced cation displacements in ferroelectric Pb(Zr(0.45)Ti(0.55))O3 perovskite oxide are modeled by starting from a short-range order. We show that the model gives the average structure correctly and properly describes the local structure. The origin of the microstrain in lead zirconate titanate is the spatially varying Zr and Ti concentration and atomic distances, which is taken into account in the simulation. High-pressure neutron powder diffraction and simulation techniques are applied for the determination of atomic positions and bond-valences as a function of pressure. Under hydrostatic pressure, the material loses its piezoelectric properties far before the transition to the cubic phase takes place. The total cation valence +6 is preserved up to 3.31 GPa by compensating the increasing B-cation valence by decreasing Pb-displacement from the high-symmetry position. At 3.31 GPa, Pb-displacement is zero and the material is no more ferroelectric. This is also the pressure at which the Pb-valence is minimized. The average structure is still tetragonal. The model for microstrain predicts that the transition occurs over a finite pressure range: Pb-displacements are spatially varying and follow the distribution of Zr and Ti ions.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2014-09-01", "authors": ["JFrantti", "YFujioka", "JZhang", "JZhu", "S CVogel", "YZhao"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4891458"}

The diaphragm has the piezoelectric material polarized in the direction perpendicular to its surface and sandwiched between two metal electrodes. When an electric field is applied between the two electrodes, the in-plane piezoelectric strain can cause larger out-of-plane deflections than a flat unimorph piezoelectric diaphragm because of the diaphragm's spherical curvature with a clamped periphery for high electromechanical coupling factor. Key performance parameters, including mechanical mode shapes, resonant frequencies, dynamic responses, and displacements, with respect to the curvature and size of the diaphragm have been investigated. Both analytical derivations and numerical simulations using finite element analysis have been performed for the optimal design of the electromechanical coupling factor, with varying factors such as mechanical resonant frequency, radius of curvature, nominal radius, and thickness.

However, maintaining a minimal interaction force between the sample and the probe is challenging at high speed specially when using conventional piezo-tubes. While rigid AFM scanners are operational at high speeds with the drawback of reduced tracking range, multi-actuation schemes have shown potential for high-speed and large-range imaging. Here we present a method to seamlessly incorporate additional actuators into conventional AFMs. The equivalent behavior of the resulting multi-actuated setup resembles that of a single high-speed and large-range actuator with maximally flat frequency response. To achieve this, the dynamics of the individual actuators and their couplings are treated through a simple control scheme. Upon the implementation of the proposed technique, commonly used PI controllers are able to meet the requirements of high-speed imaging. This forms an ideal platform for retroactive enhancement of existing AFMs with minimal cost and without compromise on the tracking range.

However, the entire amylolytic system in the digestive fluid of A. kurodai has not been studied in detail. We purified \u03b1-amylases and \u03b1-glucosidases from the digestive fluid of A. kurodai and investigated the synergistic action of these enzymes on sea lettuce. A. kurodai contain two \u03b1-amylases (59 and 80\u00a0kDa) and two \u03b1-glucosidases (74 and 86\u00a0kDa).

Glucose production from starch was higher with 80-kDa \u03b1-amylase than with 59-kDa \u03b1-amylase. Kinetic analysis indicated that 74-kDa \u03b1-glucosidase prefers short \u03b1-1,4-linked oligosaccharide, whereas 86-kDa \u03b1-glucosidase prefers large \u03b1-1,6 and \u03b1-1,4-linked polysaccharides such as glycogen.

Different concentrations of d-Limonene i.e., 1, 5, and 10g/L were tested, and an experiment without the addition of d-Limonene was prepared as control. The digestion was performed in a semi-continuous thermophilic reactor for 75 days. The result showed that daily methane production in the reactor with the addition of 1g/L d-Limonene was similar to that of control.

The total flux and butanol titer in permeate through the PDMS-PVDF membrane were up to 769.6 g/m(2)h and 323.5 g/L at 80 \u00b0C, respectively. The butanol flux and total flux increased with increasing the feed temperature as well as the feed butanol titer. The butanol separation factor and butanol titer in permeate decreased slightly in the presence of acetone and ethanol in the feed due to their preferential dissolution and competitive permeation through the membrane. In fed-batch fermentation incorporated with pervaporation, butanol titer and flux in permeate maintained at a steady level with the range of 139.9-154.0 g/L and 13.3-16.3 g/m(2)h, respectively, which was attributed to the stable butanol titer in fermentation broth as well as the excellent hydrophobic nature of the PDMS-PVDF matrix.

{"title": "Electrospun superhydrophobic membranes with unique structures for membrane distillation.", "abstract": "With modest temperature demand, low operating pressure, and high solute rejection, membrane distillation (MD) is an attractive option for desalination, waste treatment, and food and pharmaceutical processing. However, large-scale practical applications of MD are still hindered by the absence of effective membranes with high hydrophobicity, high porosity, and adequate mechanical strength, which are important properties for MD permeation fluxes, stable long-term performance, and effective packing in modules without damage. This study describes novel design strategies for highly robust superhydrophobic dual-layer membranes for MD via electrospinning. One of the newly developed membranes comprises a durable and ultrathin 3-dimensional (3D) superhydrophobic skin and porous nanofibrous support whereas another was fabricated by electrospinning 3D superhydrophobic layers on a nonwoven support. These membranes exhibit superhydrophobicity toward distilled water, salty water, oil-in-water emulsion, and beverages, which enables them to be used not only for desalination but also for other processes. The superhydrophobic dual-layer membrane #3S-N with nanofibrous support has a competitive permeation flux of 24.6 \u00b1 1.2 kg m(-2) h(-1) in MD (feed and permeate temperate were set as 333 and 293 K, respectively) due to the higher porosity of the nanofibrous scaffold. Meanwhile, the membranes with the nonwoven support exhibit greater mechanical strength due to this support combined with better long-term performance because of the thicker 3D superhydrophobic layers. The morphology, pore size, porosity, mechanical properties, and liquid enter pressure of water of these superhydrophobic composite membranes with two different structures are reported and compared with commercial polyvinylidene fluoride membranes.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2014-08-26", "authors": ["YuanLiao", "Chun-HengLoh", "RongWang", "Anthony GFane"], "doi": "10.1021/am503968n"}

{"title": "The dissection profile and mechanism of tissue-selective dissection of the piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet as a surgical instrument: laboratory investigation using Swine liver.", "abstract": "The water jet technique dissects tissue while sparing cord-like structures such as blood vessels. The mechanism of such tissue-selective dissection has been unknown. The novel piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) system can achieve dissection with remarkably reduced water consumption compared to the conventional water jet; however, the system's characteristics and dissection capabilities on any organ have not been clarified. The purposes of this study were to characterize the physical properties of the novel ADPJ system, evaluate the dissection ability in swine organs, and reveal the mechanism of tissue-selective dissection.\nThe pulsed water jet system comprised a pump chamber driven by a piezo actuator, a stainless steel tube, and a nozzle. The peak pressure of the pulsed water jet was measured through a sensing hole using a pressure sensor. The pulsed water jet technique was applied on swine liver in order to dissect tissue on a moving table using one-way linear ejection at a constant speed. The dissection depth was measured with light microscopy and evaluated histologically. The physical properties of swine liver were evaluated by breaking strength tests using tabletop universal testing instruments. The liver parenchyma was also cut with three currently available surgical devices to compare the histological findings.\nThe peak pressure of the pulsed water jet positively correlated with the input voltage (R(2) = 0.9982, p < 0.0001), and this was reflected in the dissection depth. The dissection depth negatively correlated with the breaking strength of the liver parenchyma (R(2) = 0.6694, p < 0.0001). The average breaking strengths of the liver parenchyma, hepatic veins, and Glisson's sheaths were 1.41 \u00b1 0.45, 8.66 \u00b1 1.70, and 29.6 \u00b1 11.0 MPa, respectively. The breaking strength of the liver parenchyma was significantly lower than that of the hepatic veins and Glisson's sheaths. Histological staining confirmed that the liver parenchyma was selectively dissected, preserving the hepatic veins and Glisson's sheaths in contrast to what is commonly observed with electrocautery or ultrasonic instruments.\nThe dissection depth of liver tissue is well controlled by input voltage and is influenced by the moving velocity and the physical properties of the organ. We showed that the device can be used to assure liver resection with tissue selectivity due to tissue-specific physical properties. Although this study uses an excised organ, further in vivo studies are necessary. The present work demonstrates that this device may function as an alternative tool for surgery due to its good controllability of the dissection depth and ability of tissue selectivity.", "journal": "European surgical research.

However, a major cause of battery failure is delamination between the current collector and the graphite anode. When silicon or tin is used as active material, delamination becomes a key issue owing to the large volume changes of these materials during lithation and delithation processes. Learning from Nature, we developed a new biomimetic approach based on the adhesion properties of the feet of geckos. The biomimetic approach improves adhesion between the laminate and the copper surface by introducing an array of Cu(OH)2 nanorods, which increases the surface area of the current collector. When graphite anode laminate is casted onto regular and a modified copper surfaces, the modified current collector displays superior adhesion to graphite and the PVDF binder-based electrode. The electrochemical performance of the batteries using these electrodes is not compromised by the additional chemistry of the Cu(OH)2 on the copper surface.

{"title": "Sialolithiasis. Proposal for a new minimally invasive procedure: Piezoelectric surgery.", "abstract": "Sialolithiasis is the presence of stones in the ducts of the salivary glands. Most episodes are unique, and 60-80% are located exclusively in the main excretory duct. The main clinical manifestations are swelling and pain typically before, during or after meals that decreases if the obstruction is not complete. The highest prevalence of lithiasis is in the submandibular gland -87%-, whose secretion is more viscous, followed by the parotid gland -10%- and finally the sublingual gland -3%-. The most significant consequences are caused by the prolonged blockage of the duct by a stone, which can produce a persistent ductal dilatation with a swelling that does not subside, and could lead to the complete degeneration of the parenchyma, becoming a hot spot where secondary infections may occur, leading to acute bacterial sialadenitis or glandular abscesses. Treatment options range from a single probing extraction, extraction with sialographic control using the sialoendoscope, LASER intraductal lithotripsy, lithotripsy extracorporeal shock wave (ESWL), to the surgical techniques combining open duct with endoscopic or glandular removal. We propose, with regard to a case, the use of a simple piezoelectric device which, tunnelling through the glandular channel by the ostium, allows stone fragmentation, without damaging the surrounding soft tissue. Stone removal by this less invasive method reduces the need for more complex and expensive techniques.

The heat was generated on GST layer within a few hundred of nanosecond exposure and subsequently transferred to a thin poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) film deposited on GST layer. By controlling exposure time and power of the scanned laser, ferroelectric patterns of one or two microns in size are fabricated with various shape. In the micropatterned regions, ferroelectric polymer crystals were efficiently controlled in both degree of the crystallinity and the molecular orientations. Nonvolatile memory devices with laser scanned ferroelectric polymer layers exhibited excellent device performance of large remnant polarization, ON/OFF current ratio and data retention.

{"title": "Effects of initial boost with TGF-beta 1 and grade of intervertebral disc degeneration on 3D culture of human annulus fibrosus cells.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) culture in porous biomaterials as well as stimulation with growth factors are known to be supportive for intervertebral disc cell differentiation and tissue formation. Unless sophisticated releasing systems are used, however, effective concentrations of growth factors are maintained only for a very limited amount of time in in vivo applications. Therefore, we investigated, if an initial boost with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is capable to induce a lasting effect of superior cartilaginous differentiation in slightly and severely degenerated human annulus fibrosus (AF) cells.\nHuman AF tissue was harvested during surgical treatment of six adult patients with lumbar spinal diseases. Grading of disc degeneration was performed with magnet resonance imaging. AF cells were isolated and expanded in monolayer culture and rearranged three-dimensionally in a porous biomaterial consisting of stepwise absorbable poly-glycolic acid and poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid and a supportive fine net of non-absorbable polyvinylidene fluoride. An initial boost of TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 1 and hyaluronan was applied and compared with controls. Matrix formation was assessed at days 7 and 21 by (1) histological staining of the typical extracellular matrix molecules proteoglycan and type I and type II collagens and by (2) real-time gene expression analysis of aggrecan, decorin, biglycan, type I, II, III, and X collagens as well as of catabolic matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-13.\nAn initial boost with TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 1 and hyaluronan did not enhance the expression of characteristic AF matrix molecules in our 3D culture system. AF cells showed high viability in the progressively degrading biomaterial. Stratification by grade of intervertebral disc degeneration showed that AF cells from both, slightly degenerated, or severely degenerated tissue are capable of significant up-regulations of characteristic matrix molecules in 3D culture. AF cells from severely degenerated tissue, however, displayed significantly lower up-regulations in some matrix molecules such as aggrecan.\nWe failed to show a supportive effect of an initial boost with TGF-beta 1 in our 3D culture system.

This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes-induced liver damage and its modulation by naringenin. Antioxidant status, liver & kidney biomarker enzymes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, expression of apoptotic proteins like Bax (bcl-2 associated X), Bcl-2 (b-cell Lymhoma-2), Caspase-3, Caspase-9, AIF (Apoptosis inducing factor) and Endo-G (Endonuclease-G) were studied in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Significant hyperglycemia, disturbed antioxidant status, altered carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, increased ROS and lipid peroxidation; decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced release of AIF and Endo-G were observed. Hyperglycemia also affected apoptosis and its related genes at both transcriptional and translational level (Caspase-3 & 9, Bax and Bcl-2) in the liver of diabetic rats. Naringenin, a flavonone, exerted anti-hyperglycemic effect and was able to prevent oxidative stress and resultant apoptotic events caused due to diabetes-induced hepatotoxicity.

{"title": "Evaluation of bias voltage modulation sequence for nonlinear contrast agent imaging using a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer array.", "abstract": "Many clinical diagnoses have now been improved thanks to the development of new techniques dedicated to contrast agent nonlinear imaging. Over the past few years, Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (cMUTs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional piezoelectric transducers. One notable advantage of cMUTs is their wide frequency bandwidth. However, their use in nonlinear imaging approaches such as those used to detect contrast agents have been challenging due their intrinsic nonlinear character. We propose a new contrast imaging sequence, called bias voltage modulation (BVM), specifically developed for cMUTs to suppress their inherent nonlinear behavior. Theoretical and experimental results show that a complete cancellation of the nonlinear signal from the source can be reached when the BVM sequence is implemented. In-vitro validation of the sequence is performed using a cMUT probe connected to an open scanner and a flow phantom setup containing SonoVue microbubbles. Compared to the standard amplitude modulation imaging mode, a 6\u2009dB increase of contrast-to-tissue ratio was achieved when the BVM sequence is applied. These results reveal that the problem of cMUT nonlinearity can be addressed, thus expanding the potential of this new transducer technology for nonlinear contrast agent detection and imaging.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2014-08-08", "authors": ["AnthonyNovell", "MathieuLegros", "Jean-MarcGr\u00e9goire", "Paul ADayton", "AyacheBouakaz"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/59/17/4879"}
{"title": "Maximizing phononic band gaps in piezocomposite materials by means of topology optimization.", "abstract": "Phononic crystals (PCs) can exhibit phononic band gaps within which sound and vibrations at certain frequencies do not propagate. In fact, PCs with large band gaps are of great interest for many applications, such as transducers, elastic/acoustic filters, noise control, and vibration shields. Previous work in the field concentrated on PCs made of elastic isotropic materials; however, band gaps can be enlarged by using non-isotropic materials, such as piezoelectric materials. Because the main property of PCs is the presence of band gaps, one possible way to design microstructures that have a desired band gap is through topology optimization. Thus in this work, the main objective is to maximize the width of absolute elastic wave band gaps in piezocomposite materials designed by means of topology optimization. For band gap calculation, the finite element analysis is implemented with Bloch-Floquet theory to solve the dynamic behavior of two-dimensional piezocomposite unit cells. Higher order frequency branches are investigated.

{"title": "The response of the adult and ATD heads to impacts onto a rigid surface.", "abstract": "Given the high incidence of TBI, head injury has been studied extensively using both cadavers and anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs). However, few studies have benchmarked the response of ATD heads against human data. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate the response of adult and ATD heads in impact, and to compare adult Hybrid III head responses to the adult head responses. In this study, six adult human heads and seven ATD heads were used to obtain impact properties. The heads were dropped from both 15cm and 30cm onto five impact locations: right and left parietal, forehead, occiput and vertex. One set of drops were performed on the human heads and up to four sets were carried out on the ATD heads. For each drop, the head was placed into a fine net and positioned to achieve the desired drop height and impact location. The head was then released to allow free fall without rotation onto a flat aluminum 34 -inch thick platen. The platen was attached to a three-axis piezoelectric load cell to measure the impact force. The peak resultant acceleration, head impact criterion (HIC) and impact stiffness were calculated using the force/time curve and drop mass. No statistical differences were found between the adult human heads and the adult Hybrid III head for 15cm and 30cm impacts (p>0.05). For the human heads, the mid-sagittal impact locations produced the highest HIC and peak acceleration values. The parietal impacts produced HICs and peak accelerations that were 26-48% lower than those from the mid-sagittal impacts. For the ATD heads, the acceleration and HIC values generally increased with represented age, except for the Q3, which produced HIC values up to higher than the other ATD heads. The impact responses of the adult Hybrid III onto different impact locations were found to adequately represent the impact stiffness of human adult head impacts from 30cm and below onto a rigid surface. The Q3 dummy consistently produced the highest HIC values of the ATD heads, and produced higher acceleration and HIC values than the adult human heads as well, which is contrary to neonatal data demonstrating that the head acceleration increases with age.", "journal": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "date": "2014-08-03", "authors": ["Andre MatthewLoyd", "Roger WNightingale", "YinSong", "Jason FLuck", "HattieCutcliffe", "Barry SMyers", "Cameron 'Dale'Bass"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2014.06.022"}

The piezoelectric films detect the animal's movements with high sensitivity and the regularity of the piezo output signal, related to the regular breathing movements characteristic of sleep, serves to automatically determine sleep.

{"title": "Postural stabilization and balance assessment in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A subjects.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to assess postural stabilization skill in adult subjects affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 1A. For this purpose ground reaction force (GRF) was measured by means of a piezoelectric force platform during the sit-to-stand (STS) movement, until a steady state erect posture was achieved. Specific indexes to quantify Centre of Mass acceleration, both during postural stabilization and during quiet standing, were computed using a mathematical model. Forty-seven CMT1A subjects were recruited for the study, and the control group was formed by forty-one age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The results show that CMT1A subjects are less stable than controls during the quiet stance. Greater difficulty (high values of Yinf, the final instability rate) to maintain erect posture appears to be mainly associated with plantar-flexor muscle weakness, rather than to damage of the proprioceptive system. The worst performances shown by CMT1A subjects in the stabilization phase (high values of I, the global index of postural stabilization performance) seem to be associated with reduced muscle strength and the loss of large sensory nerve fibres. Distal muscle weakness appears to affect both postural stabilization and quiet erect posture.

Our study also sheds light on the maximum pulse energies that can be delivered through the air-core PBF and identifies cladding damage at the input facet of the fiber as the limiting factor. We have achieved a maximum energy delivery larger than 700 nJ at 92% coupling efficiency. An in depth analysis reveals how this value is greatly affected by possible slight misalignments of the beam during coupling and the measured small beam pointing fluctuations. In the absence of these imperfections, self-phase modulation becomes the limiting factor for the maximum energy delivery, setting the theoretical upper bound to near 2 \u03bcJ for a 1-m long, 7-\u03bcm, air-core PBF. Finally, the use of a 300 kHz repetition rate fiber laser enabled rapid ablation of 150 \u00b5m x 150 \u00b5m area within only 50 ms. Such ablation speeds can now allow the surgeons to translate the surgery device as fast as ~4 mm/s to continuously remove a thin layer of a 150 \u00b5m wide tissue. Thanks to a high optical transmission efficiency of the in-line optical architecture of the device and improved resolution, we could successfully perform ablation of scarred cheek pouch tissue, drilling through a thin slice. With further development, this device can serve as a precise and high speed ultrafast laser scalpel in the clinic.", "journal": "Biomedical optics express", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["OnurFerhanoglu", "MuratYildirim", "KaushikSubramanian", "AdelaBen-Yakar"], "doi": "10.1364/BOE.5.002023\n10.1021/cr010379n\n10.1038/432822a\n10.1016/j.jcrs.2003.10.026\n10.1002/jbio.200910053\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3001305\n10.1109/JSTQE.2013.2287098\n10.1364/OE.16.009996\n10.1364/OE.19.010536\n10.1038/nphoton.2013.273\n10.1038/nphoton.2013.280\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.11.118001\n10.1117/1.JBO.17.3.038002\n10.1364/OL.37.003111\n10.1364/OE.19.000923\n10.1002/jbio.200900087\n10.1364/OL.37.000362\n10.1073/pnas.1121495109\n10.1364/OE.16.005556\n10.1103/PhysRevB.53.1749\n10.1016/S0169-4332(99)00228-7\n10.1109/JQE.1977.1069342\n10.1126/science.1088387\n10.1002/lsm.10029\n10.1364/AO.50.002376\n10.1007/s003399900347\n10.1007/s10103-003-0264-8\n10.1114/1.1624601\n10.1371/journal.pone.0013053\n10.1111/j.1749-4486.2009.02005.x"}

Double-inkjet printing was proposed to efficiently address the evaporation issues of picoliter droplets during array generation on a planar substrate without the assistance of a humidifier or glycerol. The method utilizes piezoelectric inkjet printing equipment to precisely eject a reagent droplet into an oil droplet, which had first been dispensed on a hydrophobic and oleophobic substrate. No evaporation, random movement, or cross-contamination was observed during array fabrication and thermal cycling. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel double-inkjet method for real-time PCR analysis. This method can readily produce multivolume droplet-in-oil arrays with volume variations ranging from picoliters to nanoliters. This feature would be useful for simultaneous multivolume PCR experiments aimed at wide and tunable dynamic ranges. These double-inkjet-based picoliter droplet arrays may have potential for multiplexed applications that require isolated containers for single-cell cultures, single molecular enzymatic assays, or digital PCR and provide an alternative option for generating droplet arrays on planar substrates without chemical patterning.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["YingnanSun", "XiaoguangZhou", "YudeYu"], "doi": "10.1039/c4lc00598h"}

{"title": "A true theranostic approach to medicine: towards tandem sensor detection and removal of endotoxin in blood.", "abstract": "Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death around the world. The condition occurs when a local infection overcomes the host natural defense mechanism and suddenly spreads into the circulatory system, triggering a vigorous, self-injurious inflammatory host response. The pathogenesis of sepsis is relatively well known, one of the most potent immuno-activator being bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - also known as 'endotoxin'. Tests exist to detect endotoxin in bodily fluids, but are expensive, not necessarily user-friendly and require reporter molecules. In addition, the situation for safe and effective anti-endotoxin therapy is problematical. At the present time, endotoxin removal through cartridge hemoperfusion is one of the better alternatives to combat sepsis. The capability to both measure endotoxemia levels and offer an adapted response treatment in a timely manner is crucial for better management and improved prognosis, but is currently unavailable. In this context, we describe herein preliminary research towards the development of an alternative LPS biosensor and an innovative LPS neutralization cartridge to be eventually combined in an all-integrated configuration for the theranostic, personalized treatment of blood endotoxemia/sepsis. LPS detection is performed in a real-time and label-free manner in full human blood plasma, using ultra-high frequency acoustic wave sensing in combination with ultrathin, oligoethylene glycol-based mixed surface chemistry imposed on piezoelectric quartz discs. Biosensing platforms are functionalized with polymyxin B (PMB), a cyclic peptide antibiotic with high affinity for LPS. Analogous surface modification is used on glass beads for the therapeutic cartridge component of the combined strategy. Incubation of LPS-spiked whole blood with PMB-bead chemistry resulted in a significant decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1 cytokine. LPS neutralization is discussed in relation to the perturbation of its supramolecular chemistry in solution.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["MichaelThompson", "ChristopheBlaszykowski", "SoniaSheikh", "AlexanderRomaschin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.008"}

The enhancement can be attributed to the facility separation and extraction of photoexcites due to the formation of the stronger and expanding built-in field, which is a result of charge redistribution induced by piezoelectric polarization at the ZnO/Au interface.

{"title": "Generating chimeric mice from embryonic stem cells via vial coculturing or hypertonic microinjection.", "abstract": "The generation of a fertile embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived or F0 (100 % coat color chimerism) mice is the final criterion in proving that the ESC is truly pluripotent. Many methods have been developed to produce chimeric mice. To date, the most popular methods for generating chimeric embryos is well sandwich aggregation between zona pellucida (ZP) removed (denuded) 2.5-day post-coitum (dpc) embryos and ESC clumps, or direct microinjection of ESCs into the cavity (blastocoel) of 3.5-dpc blastocysts. However, due to systemic limitations and the disadvantages of conventional microinjection, aggregation, and coculturing, two novel methods (vial coculturing and hypertonic microinjection) were developed in recent years at my laboratory.Coculturing 2.5-dpc denuded embryos with ESCs in 1.7-mL vials for ~3 h generates chimeras that have significantly high levels of chimerism (including 100 % coat color chimerism) and germline transmission. This method has significantly fewer instrumental and technological limitations than existing methods, and is an efficient, simple, inexpensive, and reproducible method for \"mass production\" of chimeric embryos. For laboratories without a microinjection system, this is the method of choice for generating chimeric embryos. Microinjecting ESCs into a subzonal space of 2.5-dpc embryos can generate germline-transmitted chimeras including 100 % coat color chimerism. However, this method is adopted rarely due to the very small and tight space between ZP and blastomeres. Using a laser pulse or Piezo-driven instrument/device to help introduce ESCs into the subzonal space of 2.5-dpc embryos demonstrates the superior efficiency in generating ESC-derived (F0) chimeras. Unfortunately, due to the need for an expensive instrument/device and extra fine skill, not many studies have used either method. Recently, ESCs injected into the large subzonal space of 2.5-dpc embryos in an injection medium containing 0.2-0.3 M sucrose very efficiently generated viable, healthy, and fertile chimeric mice with 100 % coat color chimerism.Both vial coculture and hypertonic microinjection methods are useful and effective alternatives for producing germline chimeric or F0 mice efficiently and reliably.

In this paper, we review some key points which underpin structure, phase transition and related properties in BiFeO\u2083 ultrathin films. Compared with the bulk counterparts, we survey the recent results of epitaxial BiFeO\u2083 ultrathin films to illustrate how the atomic structure and phase are markedly influenced by the interface between the film and the substrate, and to emphasize the roles of misfit strain and depolarization field on determining the domain patterns, phase transformation and associated physical properties of BiFeO\u2083 ultrathin films, such as polarization, piezoelectricity, and magnetism. One of the obvious consequences of the misfit strain on BiFeO\u2083 ultrathin films is the emergence of a sequence of phase transition from tetragonal to mixed tetragonal &amp; rhombohedral, the rhombohedral, mixed rhombohedral &amp; orthorhombic, and finally orthorhombic phases. Other striking features of this system are the stable domain patterns and the crossover of 71\u00b0 and 109\u00b0 domains with different electrical boundary conditions on the film surface, which can be controlled and manipulated through the depolarization field. The external field-sensitive enhancements of properties for BiFeO\u2083 ultrathin films, including the polarization, magnetism and morphotropic phase boundary-relevant piezoelectric response, offer us deeper insights into the investigations of the emergent properties and phenomena of epitaxial ultrathin films under various mechanical/electrical constraints.

To aid the design process of this transducer, a coupling biomechanical model of the human middle ear and the piezoelectric transducer was established by reverse engineering technology. The validity of this model was confirmed by comparing model predicted motions with experimental measurements. Based on this verified biomechanical model, the main parameters of the transducer were determined. And its power consumption was calculated. Finally, to verify the capability of the designed piezoelectric transducer, a human temporal bone experimental platform was built. And the dynamic characteristics and the stimulated performance of the piezoelectric transducer were tested. The result showed that stapes displacement stimulated by the transducer excitation at 10.5 V RMS was equivalent to that from acoustic stimulation at 100 dB SPL, which is an adequate stimulation to the ossicular chain. The corresponding power consumption is 0.31 mW per volt of excitation at 1 kHz, which is low enough for the transducer to be used in a middle ear implant.

Unintentionally doped and Si-doped GaN nanowire arrays with various carrier concentrations, ranging from 10(17) (unintentionally doped) to 10(19) cm(-3) (heavily doped), are synthesized. For SNWNGs, the output current of individual nanowires starts from a negligible level and rises to the maximum of \u224850 nA at a doping concentration of 5.63 \u00d7 10(18) cm(-3) and then falls off with further increase in carrier concentration, due to the competition between the reduction of inner resistance and the screening effect on piezoelectric potential.

Therefore, mechanotransduction is crucial for organ development and homeostasis and plays a direct role in hearing, touch, proprioception, and pain. Multiple molecular players involved in mechanotransduction have been identified in the past, among them ion channels directly activated by cell membrane deformation. Most of these channels have well-established roles in lower organisms but are not conserved in mammals or fail to encode mechanically activated channels in mammals due to non-conservation of mechanotransduction property. A family of mechanically activated channels that counts only two members in human, piezo1 and 2, has emerged recently. Given the lack of valid mechanically activated channel candidates in mammals in the past decades, particular attention is given to piezo channels and their potential roles in various biological functions.

Moreover, the modulation of strain can be controlled under an external electric field via converse piezoelectric effect of PMN-PT used in this work. Consequently, controllable emission of the STO:Ni thin film is demonstrated in a reversible and real-time way, arising from the biaxial strain produced by piezoelectric PMN-PT.

The radiative and nonradiative recombination processes of quantum dots are strongly affected by adjusting the capping thickness, and the GaN quantum dots with 12 monolayers-thick Al(0.5)Ga(0.5)N capping layer show a remarkably high internal quantum efficiency of more than 80% at room temperature.

{"title": "The physics of hearing: fluid mechanics and the active process of the inner ear.", "abstract": "Most sounds of interest consist of complex, time-dependent admixtures of tones of diverse frequencies and variable amplitudes. To detect and process these signals, the ear employs a highly nonlinear, adaptive, real-time spectral analyzer: the cochlea. Sound excites vibration of the eardrum and the three miniscule bones of the middle ear, the last of which acts as a piston to initiate oscillatory pressure changes within the liquid-filled chambers of the cochlea. The basilar membrane, an elastic band spiraling along the cochlea between two of these chambers, responds to these pressures by conducting a largely independent traveling wave for each frequency component of the input. Because the basilar membrane is graded in mass and stiffness along its length, however, each traveling wave grows in magnitude and decreases in wavelength until it peaks at a specific, frequency-dependent position: low frequencies propagate to the cochlear apex, whereas high frequencies culminate at the base. The oscillations of the basilar membrane deflect hair bundles, the mechanically sensitive organelles of the ear's sensory receptors, the hair cells. As mechanically sensitive ion channels open and close, each hair cell responds with an electrical signal that is chemically transmitted to an afferent nerve fiber and thence into the brain. In addition to transducing mechanical inputs, hair cells amplify them by two means. Channel gating endows a hair bundle with negative stiffness, an instability that interacts with the motor protein myosin-1c to produce a mechanical amplifier and oscillator. Acting through the piezoelectric membrane protein prestin, electrical responses also cause outer hair cells to elongate and shorten, thus pumping energy into the basilar membrane's movements. The two forms of motility constitute an active process that amplifies mechanical inputs, sharpens frequency discrimination, and confers a compressive nonlinearity on responsiveness. These features arise because the active process operates near a Hopf bifurcation, the generic properties of which explain several key features of hearing. Moreover, when the gain of the active process rises sufficiently in ultraquiet circumstances, the system traverses the bifurcation and even a normal ear actually emits sound. The remarkable properties of hearing thus stem from the propagation of traveling waves on a nonlinear and excitable medium.", "journal": "Reports on progress in physics.

For the theoretical analysis, the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of the rotating disk in air and water are obtained with the Kirchhoff-Love thin plate theory coupled with the interaction with the surrounding fluid. A model for the Rotor Stator Interaction that occurs in many rotating disk-like parts of turbomachinery such as compressors, hydraulic runners or alternators is presented. The dynamic behavior of the rotating disk due to this excitation is deduced. For the experimental analysis a test rig has been developed. It consists of a stainless steel disk (r = 198 mm and h = 8 mm) connected to a variable speed motor. Excitation and response are measured from the rotating system. For the rotating excitation four piezoelectric patches have been used.

BAC treatment of the BTSE resulted in a marked improvement in permeate flux, which was attributed to the effective removal of organic foulants and particulates. Although the BAC removed significantly less dissolved organic carbon than the granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment which was used as a control for comparison, it led to a markedly greater flux. This was attributed to the effective removal of the very high molecular weight substances such as biopolymers by the BAC through biodegradation and adsorption of those molecules on the biofilm. Size exclusion chromatography showed the BAC treatment led to approximately 30% reduction in these substances, whereas the GAC did not greatly remove these molecules. The BAC treatment led to a greater reduction of loosely-attached and firmly-attached membrane surface foulant, and this was confirmed by attenuated total reflection-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis.

In previous studies, variation of the local dielectric constant was accomplished by studying luminophores in chemically and structurally different hosts. In contrast, the NR/PVDF guest-host pair allows for the investigation of PI as a function of \u03b5 while keeping the chemical composition of both the luminophore and host unchanged. The solvatochromic properties of NR are used to measure the local \u03b5, while fluctuations in NR emission intensity over time provide a measure of the PI. PVDF is an ideal host for this study because it provides submicron-sized dielectric domains that vary from nonpolar (\u03b5 \u2248 2) to very polar (\u03b5 \u2248 70). The results presented here demonstrate that the local dielectric environment can have a pronounced effect on PI. We find that the NR emissive events increase 5-fold with an increase in \u03b5 from 2.2 to 74. A complex dependence on \u03b5 is also observed for NR nonemissive event durations, initially increasing as \u03b5 increases from 2.2 to 3.4 but decreasing in duration with further increase in \u03b5. The variation in emissive event durations with \u03b5 is reproduced using a photoinduced electron-transfer model involving electron transfer from NR to PVDF. In addition, an increase in NR photostability with an increase in \u03b5 is observed, suggesting that the dielectric environment plays an important role in defining the photostability of NR in PVDF.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Such effects were reported mainly in framework materials. When heated, they typically contract in the same direction of negative linear compression. Here we show that this common inverse relationship rule does not apply to a three-dimensional metal-organic framework crystal, [Ag(ethylenediamine)]NO3. In this material, the direction of the largest intrinsic negative linear compression yet observed in metal-organic frameworks coincides with the strongest positive thermal expansion. In the perpendicular direction, the large linear negative thermal expansion and the strongest crystal compressibility are collinear. This seemingly irrational positive relationship of temperature and pressure effects is explained and the mechanism of coupling of compressibility with expansivity is presented.

In a recent submission (Phys. Chem. Chem.

We now understand that the fraction of PMMA in the blends governs the origin of polymorphism in PVDF. This motivated us to systematically study the effect of shear on the crystallization behavior of PVDF especially in blends with different polymorphic forms of PVDF. Two model blends were selected; one with a mixture of \u03b1 and \u03b2 crystals and the other predominantly rich in \u03b1 crystals. Initially, physical ageing, at different oscillation frequencies (1 rad s(-1) and 0.1 rad s(-1)), was monitored by melt rheology and subsequently, the effect of steady shear was probed in situ without changing the history of the samples. Intriguingly, the rate of crystallization was observed to be significantly higher for higher oscillation frequencies, which essentially suggest that shear has induced crystallization in the blends.

Up to now, photo-induced GHz-THz acoustic phonons have been mainly explored in metals and semiconductors, and in artificial nanostructures to enhance their phononic emission. However, despite their inherent strong polarization (providing natural asymmetry) and superior piezoelectric properties, ferroelectric oxides have been only poorly regarded. Here, by using ultrafast optical pump-probe measurements, we show that photogeneration/photodetection of coherent phonons in BiFeO3 ferroelectric leads, at room temperature, to the largest intensity ratio ever reported of GHz transverse acoustic wave versus the longitudinal one. It is found that the major mechanism involved corresponds to screening of the internal electric fields by light-induced charges, which in turn induces stress by inverse piezoelectric effect. This giant opto-acoustic response opens new perspectives for the use of ferroelectric oxides in ultrahigh frequency acoustic devices and the development of new GHz-THz acoustic sources.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2014-07-02", "authors": ["MariuszLejman", "GwenaelleVaudel", "Ingrid CInfante", "PascaleGemeiner", "Vitalyi EGusev", "BrahimDkhil", "PascalRuello"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms5301"}

{"title": "Evaluation of the maximum isometric tongue force of healthy volunteers.", "abstract": "The forces of specific muscle groups have been well described for nearly all parts of the human body. Interestingly, data for the tongue and its forces are rare. In light of ongoing development of systems for managing the tongue (retaining, advancing, suspending or stabilizing), especially in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, knowledge of the maximum tongue force is important for the conceptual design of those systems. The maximum tongue force in a sagittal direction was documented using a custom-built device that included a tongue clamp and a piezoelectric sensor to capture force measurements. Once positioned securely in the device, participants were asked to move the tongue in a posterior sagittal direction, with maximum force, in each of three test positions. Forty-nine healthy volunteers (29 male) were included in the study. Tongue force measurements were collected three times in three different tongue positions. Thirty-three participants had repeated measurements to investigate any potential learning effect. The maximum force of the human tongue in a posterior sagittal direction showed high inter-individual variation and ranged from 3.2 to 52.4 Newton (N; mean 14.1 \u00b1 7.5 N), when measured from a \"neutral protrusion or resting\" tongue position. The \"retracted\" and \"maximal protrusion\" testing positions yielded lower maximum tongue forces. Men (m) showed statistically significantly higher tongue forces than women (w) (m: 16.0 \u00b1 8.4 N, w: 11.0 \u00b1 4.3 N), and there was a positive correlation with BMI and a negative correlation with age. Comparing the first measurement session with the second session (per patient) showed higher mean maximum forces in the second session, but with no statistical significance.

Although fabrication of an all-optical 2-D array suitable for in vivo imaging remains incomplete, a thin-film structure integrating a polyimide film with a Fabry-Perot (etalon) receiver has been shown to be a viable candidate. We present here incremental improvements in the performance of a polyimide-etalon transducer and demonstrate imaging with an array configuration alternative to our previous study. We first show that a gain of more than 30% in output pressure is achieved when increasing the thickness of a bare polyimide film from 3 to 15 \u03bcm. This motivated the choice of polyimide as the etalon medium--a configuration made possible by utilizing a dielectric mirror that transmits wavelengths used for generation of ultrasound (ultraviolet) and reflects those for detection (near infrared). The increased reflectivity of the dielectric mirror resulted in a 2-fold decrease in noise-equivalent pressure to 3.3 kPa over a bandwidth of 47.5 MHz (0.48 Pa/\u221aHz). The transmit/receive center frequency increased from 37 to 49 MHz with a -6-dB bandwidth of 126%, and a maximum pressure of 213 kPa was produced using a 43 \u03bcm UV spot.

Therefore, the amide group of sulfobetaine, which contributed significantly to the higher hydrophilicity and stability, was shown to be imperative in modifying the PVDF membrane for a stable anti-protein-fouling performance via the two-step polymerization method.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2014-06-25", "authors": ["QianLi", "Han-HanLin", "Xiao-LinWang"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes4020181\n10.1002/app.28606\n10.1002/app.31324\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.04.044\n10.1021/la063737w\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.11.039\n10.1021/cr800208y\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.10.050\n10.1039/c1cc16217a\n10.1016/j.jiec.2012.05.021\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1002/pi.1277\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.041\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.01.015\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.06.048\n10.1002/app.20860\n10.1021/bm9006503\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.05.041\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.06.037\n10.1002/app.36715\n10.1080/01496391003775808\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.01.064\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.066\n10.1021/ja042898o\n10.1021/ma800625y\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.09.010\n10.1021/la700579x\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.10.040\n10.1021/bc00032a002"}

Apparatus newly developed in our laboratory was used to quantitatively measure membrane stiffness during phase separation. In this apparatus, a cooling polymer solution, placed on a stage, is moved upwards and the surface of the polymer solution contacts a sphere attached to the tip of a needle. The displacement of a blade spring attached to the needle is then measured by a laser displacement sensor. Different phase separation modes, such as liquid-liquid (L-L) phase separation and solid-liquid (S-L) phase separation (polymer crystallization) were investigated. In the case of S-L phase separation, the stiffness of the solution surface began to increase significantly just before termination of crystallization. In contrast, L-L phase separation delayed solidification of the solution. This was because mutual contact of the spherulites was obstructed by droplets of polymer-lean phase formed during L-L phase separation. Thus, the solidification rate was slower for the L-L phase separation system than for the S-L phase separation system.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2014-06-25", "authors": ["ToruIshigami", "YokoNii", "YoshikageOhmukai", "SaeidRajabzadeh", "HidetoMatsuyama"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes4010113\n10.1021/ma00154a031\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)85130-3\n10.1021/ma00225a018\n10.1016/0376-7388(91)80073-F\n10.1016/0376-7388(95)00106-M\n10.1006/jcis.1996.0435\n10.1016/S0376-7388(97)00313-X\n10.1016/S0032-3861(98)00040-8\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(20000516)76:7<1028::AID-APP6>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.03.043\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.05.031\n10.1016/S0376-7388(03)00314-4\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.08.004\n10.1016/j.desal.2007.10.044\n10.1016/j.polymer.2009.03.006\n10.1021/ma00205a014\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.07.029\n10.1016/0376-7388(94)00189-6\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)00526-3\n10.1002/polb.10361\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.04.045\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.03.011\n10.1016/j.seppur.2008.05.027\n10.1002/polb.1988.090260405\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.04.001"}

{"title": "Impact of operating conditions on the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals by membrane photocatalytic reactor.", "abstract": "This study focuses on the performance of a submerged membrane photocatalytic reactor for the removal of 17beta-oestradiol (E2) in the presence of humic acid (HA). In addition to the impact of operating parameters, such as membrane pore size, ultraviolet (UV) intensity and hydraulic retention time (HRT), the influence of long-term operation was also assessed by advanced characterization of the fouling layer formed on the membrane. The tighter (0.04 microm) hollow fibre polyvinylydene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was found to exhibit not only higher HA removal than the (0.2 microm) module (85% and 75%, respectively), but also greater transmembrane pressure (TMP) values and higher irreversible fouling. Long-term operation conditions have been simulated by conducting an ageing catalyst process and demonstrated a decrease in performance obtained with time. The artificially aged TiO2 resulted in higher TMP values and lower HA removals (about 10-20% decrease) compared with the non-aged catalyst. For E2 removal in the presence of HA, the passive adsorption of the oestrogen onto the organic matter was found to be significant (40% of the E2 adsorbed after I h), demonstrating the importance of the nature of the water matrix for this type of treatment process. An increase in the UV light intensity was observed to favour the E2 elimination, leading to more than 90% removal when using 64 W combined with PVDF membrane and an HRT of 3 h.", "journal": "Environmental technology", "date": "2014-06-25", "authors": ["RaquelL\u00f3pez Fern\u00e1ndez", "Heather MColeman", "PierreLe-Clech"], "doi": "10.1080/09593330.2014.892539"}

If the metal is properly selected, it can be used in environmental applications adding two advantages simultaneously.

The composite nanofiber webs are made by electrospinning mixed solutions of poly(inylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and Ag NWs in a cosolvent mixture of dimethyl formamide and acetone. The diameter of the fibers ranges from 200 nm to 500 nm, as demonstrated by SEM images. FTIR and XRD results reveal that doping Ag NWs into PVDF greatly enhances the content of \u03b2 phase in PVDF. This \u03b2 phase increase can be attributed to interactions between the Ag NWs and the PVDF matrix, which forces the polymer chains to be embedded into the \u03b2 phase crystalline. The sensitivity of the pressure sensors agrees well with the FTIR and XRD characteristics. In our experiments, the measured sensitivity reached up to 30 pC/N for the nanofiber webs containing 1.5 wt% Ag NWs, which is close to that of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE), (77/23)].

{"title": "Wideband optical detector of ultrasound for medical imaging applications.", "abstract": "Optical sensors of ultrasound are a promising alternative to piezoelectric techniques, as has been recently demonstrated in the field of optoacoustic imaging. In medical applications, one of the major limitations of optical sensing technology is its susceptibility to environmental conditions, e.g. changes in pressure and temperature, which may saturate the detection. Additionally, the clinical environment often imposes stringent limits on the size and robustness of the sensor. In this work, the combination of pulse interferometry and fiber-based optical sensing is demonstrated for ultrasound detection. Pulse interferometry enables robust performance of the readout system in the presence of rapid variations in the environmental conditions, whereas the use of all-fiber technology leads to a mechanically flexible sensing element compatible with highly demanding medical applications such as intravascular imaging. In order to achieve a short sensor length, a pi-phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating is used, which acts as a resonator trapping light over an effective length of 350 \u00b5m. To enable high bandwidth, the sensor is used for sideway detection of ultrasound, which is highly beneficial in circumferential imaging geometries such as intravascular imaging.

One promising solution to meet these conflicting requirements is a walking piezo motor that works with two pairs of piezo elements such that the movement is taken over by one pair, once the other pair reaches its maximum travel distance. A resolution in the pm-range can be achieved, if operating the motor within the travel range of one piezo pair. However, applying the typical walking drive signals, we measure jumps in the displacement up to 2.4 \u03bcm, when the movement is given over from one piezo pair to the other. We analyze the reason for these large jumps and propose improved drive signals.

To overcome these disadvantages, high frequency generators with the absence of MT are proposed in the literature. However, in the case of miniaturized APPJs these conventional power converters, built of ferromagnetic cores and inductors or by means of LC resonant tank circuits, are not so useful as piezoelectric transformer (PT) based power converters due to bulky components and small efficiency. We made and examined a novel atmospheric pressure plasma jet with PT supplier served as ionization source for ambient mass spectrometry, and especially mobile spectrometry where miniaturization, integration of components, and clean plasma are required.

{"title": "Applying cybernetic technology to diagnose human pulmonary sounds.", "abstract": "Chest auscultation is a crucial and efficient method for diagnosing lung disease; however, it is a subjective process that relies on physician experience and the ability to differentiate between various sound patterns. Because the physiological signals composed of heart sounds and pulmonary sounds (PSs) are greater than 120\u00a0Hz and the human ear is not sensitive to low frequencies, successfully making diagnostic classifications is difficult. To solve this problem, we constructed various PS recognition systems for classifying six PS classes: vesicular breath sounds, bronchial breath sounds, tracheal breath sounds, crackles, wheezes, and stridor sounds. First, we used a piezoelectric microphone and data acquisition card to acquire PS signals and perform signal preprocessing. A wavelet transform was used for feature extraction, and the PS signals were decomposed into frequency subbands. Using a statistical method, we extracted 17 features that were used as the input vectors of a neural network. We proposed a 2-stage classifier combined with a back-propagation (BP) neural network and learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network, which improves classification accuracy by using a haploid neural network. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve verifies the high performance level of the neural network. To expand traditional auscultation methods, we constructed various PS diagnostic systems that can correctly classify the six common PSs. The proposed device overcomes the lack of human sensitivity to low-frequency sounds and various PS waves, characteristic values, and a spectral analysis charts are provided to elucidate the design of the human-machine interface.", "journal": "Journal of medical systems", "date": "2014-06-01", "authors": ["Mei-YungChen", "Cheng-HanChou"], "doi": "10.1007/s10916-014-0058-5"}

The materials were synthesized through solvothermal and conventional solid-state techniques. RbPbCO3F and CsPbCO3F were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and exhibit three-dimensional (3D) crystal structures consisting of corner-shared PbO6F2 polyhedra. For RbPbCO3F, infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis measurements were performed. RbPbCO3F is a new noncentrosymmetric material and crystallizes in the achiral and nonpolar space group P6m2 (crystal class 6m2). Powder second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements on RbPbCO3F and CsPbCO3F using 1064 nm radiation revealed an SHG efficiency of approximately 250 and 300 \u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2, respectively. Charge constants d33 of approximately 72 and 94 pm/V were obtained for RbPbCO3F and CsPbCO3F, respectively, through converse piezoelectric measurements. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the nonlinear optical response originates from the distorted PbO6F2 polyhedra, because of the even-odd parity mixing of the O 2p states with the nearly spherically symmetric 6s electrons of Pb(2+).

In this study, we demonstrate how this natural phenomenon can be applied to develop novel nanoporous materials. The solvent annealing of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) infiltrated into nanopores induced template-directed dewetting thus preparing nanoembossing films. Then, water nanodroplets formed on the cold polymer nanopatterned surfaces following the embossing patterns, similar to dew formation on the ground. Subsequently, the nanodroplets were frozen and then removed by freeze-drying. This nano-frost array technique produced nanoporous PVDF membranes with an average thickness of 250 (\u00b1 48) nm. It was revealed that the nanopatterned surface formed by solvent annealing played an important role in achieving a nano-frost array with an adjustable size. Additionally, the freezing process led to significant changes of the PVDF crystallinity and polymorphism.

HA30/BT70 and HA10/BT90 composites exhibited piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 1.2 and 2.8pC/N, respectively, both of which were higher than the piezoelectric coefficient of natural bone. Increase of the solid loading of the suspension and solidification velocity led to the improvement of piezoelectric coefficient d33.

Accordingly, the same piezoelectric resonator that is used for energy harvesting at the body implant, may also be used for ultrasonic backward data transfer, for instance, through impedance modulation. This paper presents physical considerations and design guidelines of the body implanted transducer of a UTET link with impedance modulation for a backward data transfer.

The UTET power transfer was carried out at a frequency of 765 kHz, continuous wave (CW) mode. The backward data transfer was attained by inserting a 9% load resistance variation around its matched value (550 Ohm), resulting in a 12% increase in the acoustic reflection coefficient.

Piezoelectric energy harvesters are ideal for capturing energy from mechanical vibrations in the ambient environment. Numerous studies have been made of this application of piezoelectric energy conversion; however, the narrow frequency operation band has limited its application to generate useful power. In this paper, a broadband energy harvester with an array/matrix of piezoelectric bimorphs connected by springs has been designed and analyzed based on the 1-D piezoelectric beam equations. The predicted result shows that the operational frequency band can be enlarged significantly by carefully adjusting the small end masses, length of the beam and spring stiffness.

{"title": "Block-sparse reconstruction and imaging for Lamb wave structural health monitoring.", "abstract": "A frequently investigated paradigm for monitoring the integrity of plate-like structures is a spatially-distributed array of piezoelectric transducers, with each array element capable of both transmitting and receiving ultrasonic guided waves. This configuration is relatively inexpensive and allows interrogation of defects from multiple directions over a relatively large area. Typically, full sets of pairwise transducer signals are acquired by exciting one transducer at a time in a round-robin fashion. Many algorithms that operate on such data use differential signals that are created by subtracting prerecorded baseline signals, leaving only signal differences introduced by scatterers. Analysis methods such as delay-and-sum imaging operate on these signals to detect and locate point-like defects, but such algorithms have limited performance and suffer when potential scatterers have high directionality or unknown phase-shifting behavior. Signal envelopes are commonly used to mitigate the effects of unknown phase shifts, but this further reduces performance. The blocksparse technique presented here uses a different principle to locate damage: each pixel is assumed to have a corresponding multidimensional linear scattering model, allowing any possible amplitude and phase shift for each transducer pair should a scatterer be present. By assuming that the differential signals are linear combinations of a sparse subset of these models, it is possible to split such signals into location-based components. Results are presented here for three experiments using aluminum and composite plates, each with a different type of scatterer. The scatterers in these images have smaller spot sizes than delay-and-sum imaging, and the images themselves have fewer artifacts. Although a propagation model is required, block-sparse imaging performs well even with a small number of transducers or without access to dispersion curves.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2014-05-27", "authors": ["Ross MLevine", "Jennifer EMichaels"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2014.2996"}

{"title": "A hybrid indoor ambient light and vibration energy harvester for wireless sensor nodes.", "abstract": "To take advantage of applications where both light and vibration energy are available, a hybrid indoor ambient light and vibration energy harvesting scheme is proposed in this paper. This scheme uses only one power conditioning circuit to condition the combined output power harvested from both energy sources so as to reduce the power dissipation. In order to more accurately predict the instantaneous power harvested from the solar panel, an improved five-parameter model for small-scale solar panel applying in low light illumination is presented. The output voltage is increased by using the MEMS piezoelectric cantilever arrays architecture. It overcomes the disadvantage of traditional MEMS vibration energy harvester with low voltage output. The implementation of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for indoor ambient light is implemented using analog discrete components, which improves the whole harvester efficiency significantly compared to the digital signal processor.

For real detectors, which integrate the pressure over their finite size, images reconstructed by these algorithms show some blurring. Iterative reconstruction algorithms using an imaging matrix can take the finite size of real detectors directly into account, but the numerical effort is significantly higher compared to the use of direct algorithms. For spherical or cylindrical detection surfaces, the blurring caused by a finite detector size is proportional to the distance from the rotation center (spin blur) and is equal to the detector size at the detection surface. In this work, we apply deconvolution algorithms to reduce this type of blurring on simulated and on experimental data. Two particular deconvolution methods are compared, which both utilize the fact that a representation of the blurred image in polar coordinates decouples pixels at different radii from the rotation center.

A biological tissue was placed on a plastic substrate with a thickness of 0.5mm. A focused acoustic pulse with a wide frequency band was irradiated from the \"rear side\" of the substrate. In order to generate the acoustic wave, an electric pulse with two nanoseconds in width was applied to a PVDF-TrFE type transducer. The component of echo intensity at an appropriate frequency was extracted from the signal received at the same transducer, by performing a time-frequency domain analysis. The spectrum intensity was interpreted into local acoustic impedance of the target tissue. The acoustic impedance of the substrate was carefully assessed prior to the measurement, since it strongly affects the echo intensity. In addition, a calibration was performed using a reference material of which acoustic impedance was known. The reference material was attached on the same substrate at different position in the field of view.

{"title": "Experimental measurement of utricle system dynamic response to inertial stimulus.", "abstract": "The membranous utricle sac of the red-eared turtle was mounted in a piezoelectric actuated platform mounted on the stage of a light microscope. The piezoelectric actuator oscillated the base of the neuroepithelium along a linear axis. Displacements were in the plane of the utricle and consisted of a linear sinusoidal-sweep signal starting at 0 and increasing to 500\u00a0Hz over 5\u00a0s. This inertial stimulus caused measurable shear displacement of the otoconial layer's dorsal surface, resulting in shear deformation of the gelatinous and column filament layers. Displacements of the otoconial layer and a reference point on the neuroepithelium were filmed at 2,000 frames/s with a high-speed video camera during oscillations. Image registration was performed on the video to track displacements with a resolution better than 15\u00a0nm. The displacement waveforms were then matched to a linear second-order model of the dynamic system. The model match identified two system mechanical parameters-the natural circular frequency \u03c9 n and the damping ratio \u03b6-that characterized the utricle dynamic response. The median values found for the medial-lateral axis on 20 utricles with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals in parenthesis were as follows: \u03c9 n\u2009=\u2009374 (353, 396)\u2009Hz and \u03b6\u2009=\u20090.50 (0.47, 0.53). The anterior-posterior axis values were not significantly different: \u03c9 n\u2009=\u2009409 (390, 430)\u2009Hz and \u03b6\u2009=\u20090.53 (0.48, 0.57). The results have two relevant and significant dynamic system findings: (1) a higher than expected natural frequency and (2) significant under damping.

{"title": "Highly entangled photons from hybrid piezoelectric-semiconductor quantum dot devices.", "abstract": "Entanglement resources are key ingredients of future quantum technologies. If they could be efficiently integrated into a semiconductor platform, a new generation of devices could be envisioned, whose quantum-mechanical functionalities are controlled via the mature semiconductor technology. Epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) embedded in diodes would embody such ideal quantum devices, but a fine-structure splitting (FSS) between the bright exciton states lowers dramatically the degree of entanglement of the sources and hampers severely their real exploitation in the foreseen applications. In this work, we overcome this hurdle using strain-tunable optoelectronic devices, where any QD can be tuned for the emission of photon pairs featuring the highest degree of entanglement ever reported for QDs, with concurrence as high as 0.75 \u00b1 0.02. Furthermore, we study the evolution of Bell's parameters as a function of FSS and demonstrate for the first time that filtering-free violation of Bell's inequalities requires the FSS to be smaller than 1 \u03bceV. This upper limit for the FSS also sets the tuning range of exciton energies (\u223c1 meV) over which our device operates as an energy-tunable source of highly entangled photons. A moderate temporal filtering further increases the concurrence and the tunability of exciton energies up to 0.82 and 2 meV, respectively, though at the expense of 60% reduction of count rate.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2014-05-23", "authors": ["RinaldoTrotta", "Johannes SWildmann", "EugenioZallo", "Oliver GSchmidt", "ArmandoRastelli"], "doi": "10.1021/nl500968k"}

The aptamer was firstly assembled to the gold electrode surface of 100 MHz LiTaO3 piezoelectric crystal, which could effectively captured target cells (MCF-7 cells) based on the specific interaction between aptamer and the overexpression of MUC1 protein on tumor cell surface. The aptamer-cell complexes increased the mass loading of LSAW aptasensor and led to phase shifts of LSAW. The plot of phase shift against the logarithm of concentration of MCF-7 cells was linear over the range from 1 \u00d7 10(2) cells mL(-1) to 1 \u00d7 10(7) cells mL(-1) with a correlation coefficient of 0.994. The detection limit as low as 32 cells mL(-1) was achieved for MCF-7 cells. The LSAW aptasensor also exhibited excellent specificity and stability.

AlN films are deposited on moderately doped silicon substrates covered either with partially metallic or fully insulating Bragg mirrors, and on insulating glass plates covered with insulating acoustic reflectors. TiOx seed layers are used to promote the growth of highly c-axis oriented AlN films, which is confirmed by XRD and SAW measurements. The excitation of the resonant modes is achieved through coplanar Mo electrodes of different geometries defined on top of the AlN films. All the structures analyzed display a clear longitudinal mode travelling at 11,000 m/s, whose excitation is attributed to the direction of the electric field (parallel to the c-axis) below the electrodes; this is enhanced when a conductive plane (metallic layer or Si substrate) is present under the piezoelectric layer. Conversely, only a weak shear resonance (6,350 m/s) is stimulated through the effect of coplanar electrodes, which is explained by the weakness of the electric field strength parallel to the surface between the electrodes. A significantly more effective excitation of shear modes can be achieved by normal excitation of AlN films with tilted c-axis.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2014-05-17", "authors": ["MClement", "EIborra", "JOlivares", "MDeMiguel-Ramos", "TMirea", "JSangrador"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2014.04.014"}

In-vitro topographic studies have yielded variable results, and clinical studies are necessary to compare root surface topography after planing with current ultrasonic devices and with traditional manual instrumentation. The aim of this study was to compare the topography of untreated single-rooted teeth planed in vivo with a curette, a piezoelectric ultrasonic (PU) scraper or a vertically oscillating ultrasonic (VOU) scraper.\nIn a randomized experimental trial of 19 patients, 44 single-rooted teeth were randomly assigned to one of four groups for: no treatment; manual root planing with a curette; root planing with a PU scraper; or root planing with a VOU scraper. Post-treatment, the teeth were extracted and their topography was analyzed in 124 observations with white-light confocal microscopy, measuring the roughness parameters arithmetic average height, root-mean-square roughness, maximum height of peaks, maximum depth of valleys, absolute height, skewness and kurtosis.\nThe roughness values arithmetic average height and root-mean-square roughness were similar after each treatment and lower than after no treatment (\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Following the successful growth of ultra-thin zirconia on Pt3Zr(0\u20090\u20090\u20091) (Antlanger et al 2012 Phys. Rev. B 86 035451), we report on recent progress into ZrO2 thin films, which were prepared by oxidation of a Pd3Zr(0\u20090\u20090\u20091) crystal. Results from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as density-functional theory (DFT) are presented. Many sputter-annealing cycles are required for preparation of the clean Pd3Zr alloy surface, because oxygen easily dissolves in the bulk. By oxidation and post-annealing, a homogeneous ultra-thin ZrO2 film was obtained. This is an O-Zr-O trilayer based on cubic ZrO2(1\u20091\u20091). Using STM images corrected for distortion and creep of the piezo scanner the in-plane lattice parameter was determined as (351.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4)\u00a0pm, slightly contracted with respect to the cubic ZrO2 bulk phase. The oxide forms an overlayer that is either incommensurate or has a very large superstructure cell (a\u00a0=\u00a08.3\u00a0nm); nevertheless its rotational orientation is always the same. In contrast to ultra-thin zirconia on Pt3Zr(0\u20090\u20090\u20091), where the uppermost substrate layer is pure (but reconstructed) Pt, STM and XPS suggest a stoichiometric Pd3Zr below the oxide. The oxide film binds to the substrate mainly via bonds between oxygen and the Zr atoms in the substrate. The ultra-thin oxide shows large buckling in STM, confirmed by DFT calculations, where the buckling of the Zr layer can exceed 100\u00a0pm. Compared to the ZrO2 film on Pt3Zr(0\u20090\u20090\u20091), the oxide on Pd3Zr(0\u20090\u20090\u20091) has the advantage that the substrate below does not reconstruct, leading to a homogeneous oxide film.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

However, immune cells such as macrophages might evoke a rejection of an implant due to an undesired activation by the materials. Here, the influence of different strategies for peptide immobilization onto (poly)-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) on inflammation and angiogenesis is studied. The inflammatory response of human primary macrophages is investigated by analyzing inflammatory cytokine expression. Surface roughness and adsorptive coupling have only minor effects on macrophage activation. Acrylic acid (AAc)-based covalent RGD-coupling leads to the most favorable cellular reaction, indicated by increased VEGF release. Chemical vapor deposition treated surfaces are inert, but additional covalent coupling of RGD induces a pronounced proinflammatory reaction. An in vivo angiogenesis study reveals that covalent coupling of RGD results in delayed but increased angiogenesis.

The piezo-spectroscopic coefficient, which is a Raman shift value per stress (cm(-1)/GPa), was fitted from the result of four-points bending test of rectangular HAp bar and as-sprayed HAp on Zn plate. The calculated values were 3.89cm(-1)/GPa for the former and 7.11cm(-1)/GPa for the latter. By using these calibrations, the compressive residual stress in HAp coating with HAp/Ti bond coating (HA-B) has been found to be distributed in the range of -137MPa to -75MPa. For the heat-treated HAp coating (HA-B-HT) specimen, the compressive residual stresses placed in the range of -40--22MPa. The changes in the values of residual stress of the HAp coating after immersion in SBF were also evaluated. The residual stress in HA-WB specimens tend to change from compressive to tensile after 30 days immersion. The HA-B-HT specimens exhibited similar behavior and reached to zero stress after the immersion. The mechanism of the changes in residual stress would be the effect of stress redistribution around melted calcium phosphate particles to remained HAp splats.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2014-05-14", "authors": ["AchariyaRakngarm Nimkerdphol", "YuichiOtsuka", "YoshiharuMutoh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.04.007"}

{"title": "Cell patterning with a heptagon acoustic tweezer--application in neurite guidance.", "abstract": "Accurate control over positioning of cells is a highly desirable feature in tissue engineering applications since it allows, for example, population of substrates in a controlled fashion, rather than relying on random seeding. Current methods to achieve a differential distribution of cells mostly use passive patterning methods to change chemical, mechanical or topographic properties of surfaces, making areas differentially permissive to the adhesion of cells. However, these methods have no ad hoc control over the actual deposition of cells. Direct patterning methods like bioprinting offer good control over cell position, but require sophisticated instrumentation and are often cost- and time-intensive. Here, we present a novel electronically controlled method of generating dynamic cell patterns by acoustic trapping of cells at a user-determined position, with a heptagonal acoustic tweezer device. We demonstrate the capability of the device to create complex patterns of cells using the device's ability to re-position acoustic traps by using a phase shift in the acoustic wave, and by switching the configuration of active piezoelectric transducers.

{"title": "Hierarchical interfaces induce high dielectric permittivity in nanocomposites containing TiO2@BaTiO3 nanofibers.", "abstract": "Interface issues are common and crucial in nanocomposites or nanohybrid systems since the interface area is enormous on the nanoscale. In the 0-3 dimensional polymer nanocomposites, in which nano-inclusions (0-dimension) are embedded in a 3-dimensionally connected polymer matrix, enhanced dielectric permittivity could be induced by the interfacial polarization at the interfaces between the nano-inclusions and the polymer matrix. In this contribution, we propose and demonstrate that the topological structure of the interface plays an equally important role as the area of the interface in determining the dielectric polarization of polymer nanocomposites. TiO2 nanofibers embedded with BaTiO3 nanoparticles are prepared via electrospinning and then fused with polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) into polymer nanocomposite films. Modulation of hierarchical interfaces is thus achieved for these nanocomposites. The confinement of these additional interfaces inside the TiO2 nanofibers leads to percolated networks formed by the interfacial regions. The dielectric permittivity of the polymer nanocomposites is thus enhanced by \u223c300% over the PVDF matrix at a low filler loading of 11 vol%. A phase-field simulation study indicates that the enhanced dielectric permittivity could be attributed to the increased polarization in the percolated interfacial regions inside the TiO2 nanofibers.

Improvements were realized through application of an ultrasonically absorbing waveguide made of a low-frequency-absorbing tile used in sonar applications which narrows the spatial extent of the broad acoustic field. The waveguide was employed in conjunction with a sonar multilayered polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) hydrophone used as a transmitting transducer covering a frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz. The acoustic field emanating from the ultrasonically absorbing waveguide reduced the significance of diffracted acoustic waves from the membrane hydrophone ring and the consequent interference of this wave with the direct acoustic wave received by the active element of the hydrophone during calibration. Four membrane hydrophone make/ models with ring sizes (defined as the inner diameter of the annular mounting ring of the hydrophone) in the range 50 to 100 mm were employed along with a needle hydrophone. A reference membrane hydrophone, calibrated using the NPL primary standard optical interferometer in combination with the ultrasonically absorbing waveguide, was subsequently used to calibrate the other four hydrophones by comparison, again using the ultrasonically absorbing waveguide. In comparison to existing methods, the use of the ultrasonically absorbing waveguide enabled the low-frequency calibration limit of a membrane hydrophone with a ring diameter of 50 mm to be reduced from 400 kHz to 200 kHz.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2014-05-08", "authors": ["SrinathRajagopal", "BajramZeqiri", "Pierre NG\u00e9lat"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6805691"}
{"title": "An implantable pressure sensing system with electromechanical interrogation scheme.", "abstract": "In this paper, we report on the development of an implantable pressure sensing system that is powered by mechanical vibrations in the audible acoustic frequency range. This technique significantly enhances interrogation range, alleviates the misalignment issues commonly encountered with inductive powering, and simplifies the external receiver circuitry. The interrogation scheme consists of two phases: a mechanical vibration phase and an electrical radiation phase. During the first phase, a piezoelectric cantilever acts as an acoustic receiver and charges a capacitor by converting sound vibration harmonics occurring at its resonant frequency into electrical power. In the subsequent electrical phase, when the cantilever is not vibrating, the stored electric charge is discharged across an LC tank whose inductor is pressure sensitive; hence, when the LC tank oscillates at its natural resonant frequency, it radiates a high-frequency signal that is detectable using an external receiver and its frequency corresponds to the measured pressure. The pressure sensitive inductor consists of a planar coil (single loop of wire) with a ferrite core whose distance to the coil varies with applied pressure. A prototype of the implantable pressure sensor is fabricated and tested, both in vitro and in vivo (swine bladder). A pressure sensitivity of 1 kHz/cm H2O is achieved with minimal misalignment sensitivity (26% drop at 90\u00b0 misalignment between the implanted device and acoustic source; 60% drop at 90\u00b0 misalignment between the implanted device and RF receiver coil).", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2014-05-08", "authors": ["AlbertKim", "C RPowell", "BabakZiaie"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2014.2318023"}

{"title": "Fabrication of bioinspired composite nanofiber membranes with robust superhydrophobicity for direct contact membrane distillation.", "abstract": "The practical application of membrane distillation (MD) for water purification is hindered by the absence of desirable membranes that can fulfill the special requirements of the MD process. Compared to the membranes fabricated by other methods, nanofiber membranes produced by electrospinning are of great interest due to their high porosity, low tortuosity, large surface pore size, and high surface hydrophobicity. However, the stable performance of the nanofiber membranes in the MD process is still unsatisfactory. Inspired by the unique structure of the lotus leaf, this study aimed to develop a strategy to construct superhydrophobic composite nanofiber membranes with robust superhydrophobicity and high porosity suitable for use in MD. The newly developed membrane consists of a superhydrophobic silica-PVDF composite selective skin formed on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) porous nanofiber scaffold via electrospinning. This fabrication method could be easily scaled up due to its simple preparation procedures. The effects of silica diameter and concentration on membrane contact angle, sliding angle, and MD performance were investigated thoroughly. For the first time, the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) tests demonstrate that the newly developed membranes are able to present stable high performance over 50 h of testing time, and the superhydrophobic selective layer exhibits excellent durability in ultrasonic treatment and a continuous DCMD test. It is believed that this novel design strategy has great potential for MD membrane fabrication.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2014-05-07", "authors": ["YuanLiao", "RongWang", "Anthony GFane"], "doi": "10.1021/es405795s"}

Eagle syndrome is usually an acquired condition that can be related to tonsillectomy or to a neck trauma. A type of ES is the styloid-carotid syndrome, a consequence of the irritation of pericarotid sympathetic fibers and compression on the carotid artery. Clinical manifestations are found most frequently after head turning and neck compression. Although conservative treatment (analgesics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, local infiltration with steroids, or anesthetic agents) have been used, surgical treatment is often the only effective treatment in symptomatic cases.\nWe present the case of a 55-year-old patient, successfully treated under endotracheal anesthesia. The cranial portion of the calcified styloid process was shortened through an external approach, using a piezoelectric cutting device (Piezosurgery Medical II; Mectron Medical Technology, Carasco, Italy) with MT1-10 insert, pump level 4, vibration level 7.\nNo major postoperative complications such as nerve damage, hematoma, or wound dehiscence occurred.

Moreover, surgical-orthodontic treatment by corticotomies and distraction devices provides special attention to avoid the loss of blood supply to the segment; furthermore, gingival recessions may appear because the gingival tissues cannot proliferate as fast as the immediate repositioning of the tooth. This case report presents a surgical technique for buccal, palatal, and vertical movements, and examines the effects of a tooth/arch-borne tooth distractor appliance, for the alignment of ankylosed teeth. The slow movements of tooth and bone block and fine cut simplifies orthodontic treatment in patients and makes it possible to achieve complex movements in a relatively short period. The reported dislocation procedure allows a use of buccal-lingual vertical osteotomy with horizontal osteotomy to correct tooth positions via bony block movement maintaining gingival tissues in position.

Automatic application of the technique for a few seconds easily and homogeneously coats the specific primary antibody on the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. While conventional WB requires 0.4 \u03bcg of the primary antibody, the proposed technique only uses 4 \u00d7 10(-2) \u03bcg, which can be reduced further to 4 \u00d7 10(-5) \u03bcg by reducing the coater width. Moreover, the proposed process reduces antibody probing times from 60 to 10 min. The quantification capability of TDC WB showed high linearity within a 4-log2 dynamic range for detecting target antigen glutathione-S-transferase. Furthermore, TDC WB can specifically detect the extrinsic glutathione-S-transferase added in the Escherichia coli or 293T cell lysate with better staining sensitivity than conventional WB. TDC WB can also clearly probe the intrinsic \u03b2-actin, \u03b1-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which are usually used as control proteins in biological experiments.

The flexible substrates employed for present experimental study were namely a metal alloy (Phynox), metal (aluminum), polyimide (Kapton), and polyester (Mylar). ZnO thin films were deposited by an RF reactive magnetron sputtering technique. ZnO thin films of similar thicknesses of 700 \u00b1 30 nm were deposited on four different flexible substrates to have proper comparative studies. The crystallinity, surface morphology, chemical composition, and roughness of ZnO thin films were evaluated by respective material characterization techniques. The transverse piezoelectric coefficient (d31) value for assessing the piezoelectric property of ZnO thin films on different flexible substrates was measured by a four-point bending method. ZnO thin films deposited on Phynox alloy substrate showed relatively better material characterization results and a higher piezoelectric d31 coefficient value as compared to ZnO films on metal and polymer substrates. In order to experimentally verify the above observations, vibration sensing studies were performed. As expected, the ZnO thin film deposited on Phynox alloy substrate showed better vibration sensing performance. It has generated the highest peak to peak output voltage amplitude of 256 mV as compared to that of aluminum (224 mV), Kapton (144 mV), and Mylar (46 mV). Therefore, metal alloy flexible substrate proves to be a more suitable, advantageous, and versatile choice for integrating ZnO thin films as compared to metal and polymer flexible substrates for vibration sensing applications.

An elongated supercell (doubled along the c crystallographic axis) is built with respect to the unit cell of pure \u03b1-quartz and a set of 13 symmetry-independent configurations is considered. Their structural, energetic, dielectric, elastic and piezoelectric properties are computed and analyzed. All the calculations are performed using the CRYSTAL14 program with a Gaussian-type function basis set with pseudopotentials, and the hybrid functional PBE0; all geometries are fully optimized at this level of theory. In particular, for each configuration, fourth-rank elastic and compliance tensors and third-rank direct and converse piezoelectric tensors are computed. It has already been shown that the structural distortion of the solid solution increases, almost linearly, as the substitutional fraction x increases. The piezoelectric properties of the Si1-xGexO2 solid solution are found to increase with x, with a similar quasi-linear behavior. The electromechanical coupling coefficients are enhanced as well and the linear trend recently predicted by Ranieri et al (2011 Inorg.

In the reeler mouse, a model of disturbed cortical development characterized by a loss of cortical lamination, the barrel field exists in a distorted manner. Little is known about the consequences of such a highly disturbed lamination on cortical function in this model. We used in vivo intrinsic signal optical imaging together with piezo-controlled whisker stimulation to explore sensory map organization and stimulus representation in the barrel field. We found that the loss of cortical layers in reeler mice had surprisingly little incidence on these properties. The overall topological order of whisker representations is highly preserved and the functional activation of individual whisker representations is similar in size and strength to wild-type controls. Because intrinsic imaging measures hemodynamic signals, we furthermore investigated the cortical blood vessel pattern of both genotypes, where we also did not detect major differences.

The permeate increases sensitively with feed temperature and velocity, and it shows insignificant change with feed salts concentration. Heat transfer analysis showed the conduction through the matrix of the membrane presents the major part of available energy. The increasing feed temperature leads to increase thermal efficiency (TE) and decrease temperature polarization coefficient (TPC). The experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical values. Therefore, it is suggested to work at high feed temperature, which will benefit both the thermal efficiency and permeate flux. The experimental results proved that DCMD process is able to produce almost fluoride-free water suitable for many beneficial uses.", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "date": "2014-04-24", "authors": ["AliBoubakri", "RajaBouchrit", "AmorHafiane", "Salah Al-TaharBouguecha"], "doi": "10.1007/s11356-014-2858-z"}

Utilizing time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the real-time investigation of the conformational changes of the PVDF chain segment during crystallization of neat PVDF and the corresponding nanocomposite was performed. Whilst PVDF-clay nanocomposites exhibited mainly the \u03b2 crystal phase coexisting with the \u03b3 phase at low Tc (Tc < 155 \u00b0C), the coexistence of \u03b3 and \u03b2 crystalline phases was found at a high Tc temperature range (Tc > 155 \u00b0C). Experimental results were compared with predictions of the Lauritzen and Hoffman (LH) model and discrepancies were observed between model predictions and experiments. We then recalled the Brochard-de Gennes (BD) model and proposed that different crystalline polymorph formation should be inferred as a transition in the reeling-in rate dependence of the friction coefficient on nanocomposites rather than as a change in the relative rates of secondary nucleation and substrate completion. Combining LH and BD models we proposed a new mechanism to answer the contradictory questions associated with nanocomposite polymorphism. The coexistence of different polymorphs in nanocomposites was proposed to be associated with the coexistence of fast and slow moving chains, which were recognized as the free and adsorbed chains by nanofillers.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2014-04-24", "authors": ["Mohammad MahdiAbolhasani", "MinooNaebe", "QipengGuo"], "doi": "10.1039/c4cp00031e"}

Oral breathing was introduced by completely occluding the nostrils with a nose clip.

Firstly, PVDF and graphene-oxide powders are dispersed into dimethylformamide as solvent to form a sol solution. Secondly, the sol solution is deposited on a flexible ITO/PET substrate by spin-coating.

In six patients the right maxillary and mandible osteotomies were performed using traditional saw, whilst the left osteotomies by piezoosteotomy; in the remaining six patients, the surgical procedures were reversed. Intraoperative blood loss, procedure duration time, incision precision, postoperative swelling and haematoma, and nerve impairment were evaluated to compare the outcomes and costs of these two procedures.\nCompare to traditional mechanical surgery, piezoosteotomy showed a significant intraoperative blood loss reduction of 25% (p = 0.0367), but the mean surgical procedure duration was longer by 35% (p = 0.0018). Moreover, the use of piezoosteotomy for mandible procedure required more time than for the maxillary surgery (p = 0.0003). There was a lower incidence of postoperative haematoma and swelling following piezoosteotomy, and a statistically significant reduction in postoperative nerve impairment (p = 0.003).\nWe believe that piezoelectric device allows surgeons to achieve better results compared to a traditional surgical saw, especially in terms of intraoperative blood loss, postoperative swelling and nerve impairment. This device represents a less aggressive and safer method to perform invasive surgical procedures such as a Le Fort I osteotomy. However, we recommend the use of traditional saw in mandible surgery because it provides more foreseeable outcomes and well-controlled osteotomy.

{"title": "A FEM-based method to determine the complex material properties of piezoelectric disks.", "abstract": "Numerical simulations allow modeling piezoelectric devices and ultrasonic transducers. However, the accuracy in the results is limited by the precise knowledge of the elastic, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the piezoelectric material. To introduce the energy losses, these properties can be represented by complex numbers, where the real part of the model essentially determines the resonance frequencies and the imaginary part determines the amplitude of each resonant mode. In this work, a method based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) is modified to obtain the imaginary material properties of piezoelectric disks. The material properties are determined from the electrical impedance curve of the disk, which is measured by an impedance analyzer. The method consists in obtaining the material properties that minimize the error between experimental and numerical impedance curves over a wide range of frequencies. The proposed methodology starts with a sensitivity analysis of each parameter, determining the influence of each parameter over a set of resonant modes. Sensitivity results are used to implement a preliminary algorithm approaching the solution in order to avoid the search to be trapped into a local minimum. The method is applied to determine the material properties of a Pz27 disk sample from Ferroperm. The obtained properties are used to calculate the electrical impedance curve of the disk with a Finite Element algorithm, which is compared with the experimental electrical impedance curve. Additionally, the results were validated by comparing the numerical displacement profile with the displacements measured by a laser Doppler vibrometer. The comparison between the numerical and experimental results shows excellent agreement for both electrical impedance curve and for the displacement profile over the disk surface. The agreement between numerical and experimental displacement profiles shows that, although only the electrical impedance curve is considered in the adjustment procedure, the obtained material properties allow simulating the displacement amplitude accurately.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2014-04-17", "authors": ["NP\u00e9rez", "R CCarbonari", "M A BAndrade", "FBuiochi", "J CAdamowski"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2014.03.006"}

Such structures may consist of 3D non-woven fibrous materials whereas little is known about the impact of mesh size, pore architecture and fibre morphology on cellular behavior. In this study, we have developed polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) non-woven scaffolds with round, trilobal, or snowflake fibre cross section and different fibre crimp patterns (10, 16, or 28 needles per inch). Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from adipose tissue were seeded in parallel on these scaffolds and their growth was compared. Initial cell adhesion during the seeding procedure was higher on non-wovens with round fibres than on those with snowflake or trilobal cross sections. All PVDF non-woven fabrics facilitated cell growth over a time course of 15 days. Interestingly, proliferation was significantly higher on non-wovens with round or trilobal fibres as compared to those with snowflake profile. Furthermore, proliferation increased in a wider, less dense network. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the MSCs aligned along the fibres and formed cellular layers spanning over the pores. 3D PVDF non-woven scaffolds support growth of MSCs, however fibre morphology and mesh size are relevant: proliferation is enhanced by round fibre cross sections and in rather wide-meshed scaffolds.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-04-15", "authors": ["AnneSchellenberg", "RobinRoss", "GiulioAbagnale", "SylviaJoussen", "PhilippSchuster", "AnnahitArshi", "NorbertPallua", "StefanJockenhoevel", "ThomasGries", "WolfgangWagner"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353"}

{"title": "Hippocampal vulnerability and subacute response following varied blast magnitudes.", "abstract": "Clinical outcomes from blast neurotrauma are associated with higher order cognitive functions such as memory, problem solving skills and attention. Current literature is limited to a single overpressure exposure or repeated exposures at the same level of overpressure and is focused on the acute response (<3 days). In an attempt to expand the understanding of neuropathological and molecular changes of the subacute response (7 days post injury), we used an established rodent model of blast neurotrauma. Three pressure magnitudes (low, moderate and high) were used to evaluate molecular injury thresholds. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased cleaved caspase-3 levels and loss of neuronal population (NeuN+) within the hippocampus of all pressure groups. On the contrary, selective activation of microglia was observed in the low blast group. In addition, increased astrocytes (GFAP), membrane signal transduction protein (Map2k1) and calcium regulator mechanosensitive protein (Piezo 2) were observed in the moderate blast group. Results from gene expression analysis suggested ongoing neuroprotection, as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and Mn and CuZn superoxide dismutases (SOD) all increased in the low and moderate blast groups. Ongoing neuroprotection was further supported by increased SOD levels observed in the moderate group using immunohistochemistry. The gene expression level of glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) was upregulated in the low, but downregulated in the high blast group, while no changes were found in the moderate group. Overall, the data shown here provides evidence of a diverse neuroprotective and glial response to various levels of blast exposure.

The conventional method to design these devices consists in placing multiple actuators in parallel or series using gimbals which are bulky and difficult to miniaturize. Motors using a spherical rotor are interesting for miniature multidegree-of-freedom actuators. In this paper, a new actuator is proposed. It is based on a curved piezoelectric element which has its inner contact surface adapted to the diameter of the rotor. This adaptation allows to build spherical motors with a fully constrained rotor and without a need for additional guiding system. The work presents a design methodology based on modal finite element analysis. A methodology for mode selection is proposed and a sensitivity analysis of the final geometry to uncertainties and added masses is discussed.

{"title": "The role of mechanical impact in action-related auditory attenuation.", "abstract": "A number of studies have shown that sounds temporally close to one's own finger movements elicit lower-amplitude auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) than do the same tones when they are only listened to. In these studies, the actions have involved making a mechanical contact with an object. In the present study, the role of mechanical contact with an object was investigated in action-related auditory attenuation. In three experiments, participants performed a time-interval production task. In each experiment, in one condition the action involved touching an object, but no mechanical contact was made in the other. The estimated tone-related ERP contributions to the action-tone coincidence ERP waveforms (calculated by subtracting the action-related ERP from the coincidence ERP) were more attenuated when the action involved moving the finger and making a mechanical contact at the end of the movement. However, when participants kept their finger on a piezoelectric element and applied pressure impulses without moving their finger, the action did not result in stronger attenuation of the tone-related auditory ERP estimates. Although these results may suggest that auditory ERP attenuation is stronger for actions resulting in mechanical impact, they also imply that mechanical impact may confound and lead to the overestimation of auditory ERP attenuation in such paradigms, because the impact may result in faint but audible sounds.", "journal": "Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience", "date": "2014-04-12", "authors": ["J\u00e1nosHorv\u00e1th"], "doi": "10.3758/s13415-014-0283-x"}

Osteotomies were created and bone grafts were harvested using either a conventional bur or a piezoelectric device; the resulting injuries and bone grafts were evaluated over an extended time-course using molecular and cellular assays for cell death (TUNEL assay), cell viability (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining), the onset of mineralization (alkaline phosphatase activity), and bone remodelling (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity). Osteotomies created with a piezoelectric device showed greater osteocyte viability and reduced cell death. Bone grafts harvested with a piezoelectric device exhibited greater short-term cell viability than those harvested with a bur, and exhibited slightly more new bone deposition and bone remodelling. The difference in response of osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts to bone cutting via a bur and via a piezoelectric device is negligible in vivo.

The PVDF sensor comprised a 4 \u00d7 1 array, and a thin silicon pad was placed over the sensor to prevent damage. Total thickness of the merged system was approximately 1.1\u00a0mm which was thin enough to prevent the subject from being consciously aware of its presence. It was designed to be placed under subjects' backs and installed between a bed cover and mattress. The proposed method was based on the standard deviation of the PVDF signals, and it was applied to a test set for detecting apneic events. The method's performance was assessed by comparing the results with a sleep physician's manual scoring. The correlation coefficient for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) values between the methods was 0.94 (p < 0.001).

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nasal sensor is the new technique developed to assess the nasal obstruction caused by DNS. This study evaluates the PVDF nasal sensor measurements in comparison with PEAK nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) measurements and visual analog scale (VAS) of nasal obstruction.\nBecause of piezoelectric property, two PVDF nasal sensors provide output voltage signals corresponding to the right and left nostril when they are subjected to nasal airflow. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the voltage signal corresponding to nasal airflow was analyzed to assess the nasal obstruction. PVDF nasal sensor and PNIF were performed on 30 healthy subjects and 30 DNS patients. Receiver operating characteristic was used to analyze the DNS of these two methods.\nMeasurements of PVDF nasal sensor strongly correlated with findings of PNIF (r = 0.67; p < 0.01) in DNS patients. A significant difference (p < 0.001) was observed between PVDF nasal sensor measurements and PNIF measurements of the DNS and the control group. A cutoff between normal and pathological of 0.51 Vp-p for PVDF nasal sensor and 120 L/min for PNIF was calculated. No significant difference in terms of sensitivity of PVDF nasal sensor and PNIF (89.7% versus 82.6%) and specificity (80.5% versus 78.8%) was calculated.\nThe result shows that PVDF measurements closely agree with PNIF findings.

{"title": "Piezo2 is required for Merkel-cell mechanotransduction.", "abstract": "How we sense touch remains fundamentally unknown. The Merkel cell-neurite complex is a gentle touch receptor in the skin that mediates slowly adapting responses of A\u03b2 sensory fibres to encode fine details of objects. This mechanoreceptor complex was recognized to have an essential role in sensing gentle touch nearly 50 years ago. However, whether Merkel cells or afferent fibres themselves sense mechanical force is still debated, and the molecular mechanism of mechanotransduction is unknown. Synapse-like junctions are observed between Merkel cells and associated afferents, and yet it is unclear whether Merkel cells are inherently mechanosensitive or whether they can rapidly transmit such information to the neighbouring nerve. Here we show that Merkel cells produce touch-sensitive currents in vitro. Piezo2, a mechanically activated cation channel, is expressed in Merkel cells. We engineered mice deficient in Piezo2 in the skin, but not in sensory neurons, and show that Merkel-cell mechanosensitivity completely depends on Piezo2. In these mice, slowly adapting responses in vivo mediated by the Merkel cell-neurite complex show reduced static firing rates, and moreover, the mice display moderately decreased behavioural responses to gentle touch. Our results indicate that Piezo2 is the Merkel-cell mechanotransduction channel and provide the first line of evidence that Piezo channels have a physiological role in mechanosensation in mammals. Furthermore, our data present evidence for a two-receptor-site model, in which both Merkel cells and innervating afferents act together as mechanosensors. The two-receptor system could provide this mechanoreceptor complex with a tuning mechanism to achieve highly sophisticated responses to a given mechanical stimulus.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2014-04-11", "authors": ["Seung-HyunWoo", "SanjeevRanade", "Andy DWeyer", "Adrienne EDubin", "YoshichikaBaba", "ZhaozhuQiu", "MattPetrus", "TakashiMiyamoto", "KritikaReddy", "Ellen ALumpkin", "Cheryl LStucky", "ArdemPatapoutian"], "doi": "10.1038/nature13251"}

Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed before the procedure, and at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after.\nPrimary outcomes were surgical success (defined as IOP reduction from baseline \u226520% and IOP >5\u2009mmHg) at the last follow-up visit, and vision-threatening complications. Secondary outcomes were mean IOP at each follow-up visit compared to baseline, medication use, complications, and re-interventions.\nIOP was significantly reduced (P\u2009<\u20090.05), from a mean preoperative value of 29.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2\u2009mmHg (n\u2009=\u20093.8 hypotensive medications) to a mean value of 21.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4\u2009mmHg at last follow-up (n\u2009=\u20093.8 hypotensive medications and n\u2009=\u20091.29 procedures) (mean IOP reduction of 26%). Complete success (IOP reduction >20% without re-intervention and without hypotensive medications adjunction) was achieved in 50% of eyes at last follow-up (mean IOP reduction of 45% in these same eyes) and qualified success (IOP reduction >20% with possible re-interventions) was achieved in 68% of eyes at last follow-up. No major intra- or post-operative complications occurred.\nUC(3) procedure seems to be an effective and well tolerated method to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.

It provides well-controlled preparation conditions, such as oxygen and argon plasma assisted cleaning and high temperature annealing. In situ characterization of a wafer is accomplished with target current spectroscopy. A piezo motor driven x-y stage allows measurements with a step size of 1 nm on the complete wafer. To benchmark the system performance, we investigated the growth of single layer h-BN on epitaxial Rh(111) thin films. A thorough analysis of the wafer was performed after cutting in atmosphere by low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The apparatus is located in a clean room environment and delivers high quality single layers of h-BN and thus grants access to large area UHV processed surfaces, which had been hitherto restricted to expensive, small area single crystal substrates.

{"title": "Design and testing of a novel piezoelectric micro-motor actuated by asymmetrical inertial impact driving principle.", "abstract": "In this paper, an asymmetrical inertial impact driving principle is first proposed, and accordingly a novel piezoelectrically actuated linear micro-motor is developed. It is driven by the inertial impact force generated by piezoelectric smart cantilever (PSC) with asymmetrical clamping locations during a driving cycle. When the PSC is excited by typical harmonic voltage signals, different equivalent stiffness will be induced due to its asymmetrical clamping locations when it is vibrating back and forth, leading to a tiny displacement difference on the two opposite directions in a cycle, and then the accumulation of tiny displacement difference will allow directional movements. A prototype of the proposed motor has been developed and investigated by means of experimental tests. The motion and dynamics characteristics of the prototype are well studied. The experimental results demonstrate that the resolution of the micro-motor is 0.02 \u03bcm, the maximum velocity is 16.87 mm/s, and the maximum loading capacity can reach up to 1 kg with a voltage of 100 V and 35 Hz.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2014-04-03", "authors": ["PingZeng", "ShujieSun", "Li'anLi", "FengXu", "GuangmingCheng"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4867455"}
{"title": "Enhanced magnetoelectric effects in composite of piezoelectric ceramics, rare-earth iron alloys, and shape-optimized nanocrystalline alloys.", "abstract": "An enhancement for magnetoelectric (ME) effects is studied in a three-phase ME architecture consisting of two magnetostrictive Terfenol-D (Tb(0.3)Dy(0.7)Fe(1.92)) plates, a piezoelectric PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) plate, and a pair of shape-optimized FeCuNbSiB nanocrystalline alloys. By modifying the conventional shape of the magnetic flux concentrator, the shape-optimized flux concentrator has an improved effective permeability (\u03bc(eff)) due to the shape-induced demagnetizing effect at its end surface. The flux concentrator concentrates and amplifies the external magnetic flux into Terfenol-D plate by means of changing its internal flux concentrating manner. Consequently, more flux lines can be uniformly concentrated into Terfenol-D plates. The effective piezomagnetic coefficients (d(33m)) of Terfenol-D plate and the ME voltage coefficients (\u03b1(ME)) can be further improved under a lower magnetic bias field. The dynamic magneto-elastic properties and the effective magnetic induction of Terfenol-D are taken into account to derive the enhanced effective ME voltage coefficients (\u03b1(ME,eff)), the consistency of experimental results and theoretical analyses verifies this enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that the maximum d(33m) in our proposed architecture achieves 22.48\u2009nm/A under a bias of 114 Oe. The maximum \u03b1(ME) in the bias magnetic range 0-900 Oe reaches 84.73 mV/Oe under the low frequency of 1 kHz, and 2.996 V/Oe under the resonance frequency of 102.3 kHz, respectively.

{"title": "High-speed spiral imaging technique for an atomic force microscope using a linear quadratic Gaussian controller.", "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a high-speed spiral imaging technique for an atomic force microscope (AFM). As an alternative to traditional raster scanning, an approach of gradient pulsing using a spiral line is implemented and spirals are generated by applying single-frequency cosine and sine waves of slowly varying amplitudes to the X and Y-axes of the AFM's piezoelectric tube scanner (PTS). Due to these single-frequency sinusoidal input signals, the scanning process can be faster than that of conventional raster scanning. A linear quadratic Gaussian controller is designed to track the reference sinusoid and a vibration compensator is combined to damp the resonant mode of the PTS. An internal model of the reference sinusoidal signal is included in the plant model and an integrator for the system error is introduced in the proposed control scheme. As a result, the phase error between the input and output sinusoids from the X and Y-PTSs is reduced. The spirals produced have particularly narrow-band frequency measures which change slowly over time, thereby making it possible for the scanner to achieve improved tracking and continuous high-speed scanning rather than being restricted to the back and forth motion of raster scanning. As part of the post-processing of the experimental data, a fifth-order Butterworth filter is used to filter noises in the signals emanating from the position sensors and a Gaussian image filter is used to filter the images. A comparison of images scanned using the proposed controller (spiral) and the AFM PI controller (raster) shows improvement in the scanning rate using the proposed method.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2014-04-03", "authors": ["HHabibullah", "H RPota", "I RPetersen"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4868249"}

{"title": "Preparation of light-responsive membranes by a combined surface grafting and postmodification process.", "abstract": "In order to modify the surface tension of commercial available track-edged polymer membranes, a procedure of surface-initiated polymerization is presented. The polymerization from the membrane surface is induced by plasma treatment of the membrane, followed by reacting the membrane surface with a methanolic solution of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). Special attention is given to the process parameters for the plasma treatment prior to the polymerization on the surface. For example, the influence of the plasma-treatment on different types of membranes (e.g. polyester, polycarbonate, polyvinylidene fluoride) is studied. Furthermore, the time-dependent stability of the surface-grafted membranes is shown by contact angle measurements. When grafting poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) in this way, the surface can be further modified by esterification of the alcohol moiety of the polymer with a carboxylic acid function of the desired substance. These reactions can therefore be used for the functionalization of the membrane surface. For example, the surface tension of the membrane can be changed or a desired functionality as the presented light-responsiveness can be inserted. This is demonstrated by reacting PHEMA with a carboxylic acid functionalized spirobenzopyran unit which leads to a light-responsive membrane. The choice of solvent plays a major role in the postmodification step and is discussed in more detail in this paper. The permeability measurements of such functionalized membranes are performed using a Franz cell with an external light source.

Eighteen membrane associated eukaryotic proteins and two secretory complement regulators (C1 inhibitor and vitronectin) were included in the study. To generate hybrid genes, double-overlap extension PCR was employed to fuse the 5' fragment (consisting of a T7 promoter and a species independent translation sequence), ORFs of the target proteins, and the 3' fragment (encompassing GFP fusion, Myc-tag and stop codon). OE-PCR generated fragments were directly mixed with the Leishmania torentolae lysate (translation mix) for protein synthesis. In order to establish a cheap and user-friendly alternative to existing cell-free protein array techniques, PCR products were spotted on the hydrophobic substrate (PVDF membrane), air-dried and covered with only 2 \u03bcL of translation mix. All synthesized proteins were spontaneously immobilized on the membrane due to the hydrophobic interaction between C-terminally fused GFP and PVDF.

LFPs have a complex dependence on spike activity and their relation is still poorly understood(1). The elucidation of these signal relations would be helpful both for clinical diagnostics (e.g. stimulation paradigms for Deep Brain Stimulation) and for a deeper comprehension of neural coding strategies in normal and pathological conditions (e.g. epilepsy, Parkinson disease, chronic pain). To this aim, one has to solve technical issues related to stimulation devices, stimulation paradigms and computational analyses. Therefore, a custom-made stimulation device was developed in order to deliver stimuli well regulated in space and time that does not incur in mechanical resonance. Subsequently, as an exemplification, a set of reliable LFP-spike relationships was extracted. The performance of the device was investigated by extracellular recordings, jointly spikes and LFP responses to the applied stimuli, from the rat Primary Somatosensory cortex. Then, by means of a multi-objective optimization strategy, a predictive model for spike occurrence based on LFPs was estimated. The application of this paradigm shows that the device is adequately suited to deliver high frequency tactile stimulation, outperforming common piezoelectric actuators. As a proof of the efficacy of the device, the following results were presented: 1) the timing and reliability of LFP responses well match the spike responses, 2) LFPs are sensitive to the stimulation history and capture not only the average response but also the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the spike activity and, finally, 3) by using the LFP signal it is possible to estimate a range of predictive models that capture different aspects of the spike activity.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2014-04-02", "authors": ["Antonio GZippo", "SaraNencini", "Gian CarloCaramenti", "MaurizioValente", "RiccardoStorchi", "Gabriele E MBiella"], "doi": "10.3791/50941"}
{"title": "Mechanisms and physiological roles of K+ efflux from root cells.", "abstract": "Potassium is the most abundant macronutrient, which is involved in a multitude of physiological processes. Potassium uptake in roots is crucial for plants; however, K(+) efflux can also occur and has important functions. Potassium efflux from roots is mainly induced by stresses, such as pathogens, salinity, freezing, oxidants and heavy metals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exogenous purines also cause this reaction. The depolarisation and activation of cation channels are required for K(+) efflux from plant roots. Potassium channels and nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) are involved in this process. Some of them are 'constitutive', while the others require a chemical agent for activation. In Arabidopsis, there are 77 genes that can potentially encode K(+)-permeable channels. Potassium-selective channel genes include 9 Shaker and 6 Tandem-Pore K(+) channels. Genes of NSCCs are more abundant and present by 20 cyclic nucleotide gated channels, 20 ionotropic glutamate receptors, 1 two-pore channel, 10 mechanosensitive-like channels, 2 mechanosensitive 'Mid1-Complementing Activity' channels, 1 mechanosensitive Piezo channel, and 8 annexins. Two Shakers (SKOR and GORK) and several NSCCs are expressed in root cell plasma membranes. SKOR mediates K(+) efflux from xylem parenchyma cells to xylem vessels while GORK is expressed in the epidermis and functions in K(+) release. Both these channels are activated by ROS. The GORK channel activity is stimulated by hydroxyl radicals that are generated in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner in stress conditions, such as salinity or pathogen attack, resulting in dramatic K(+) efflux from root cells. Potassium loss simulates cytosolic proteases and endonucleases, leading to programmed cell death. Other physiological functions of K(+) efflux channels include repolarisation of the plasma membrane during action potentials and the 'hypothetical' function of a metabolic switch, which provides inhibition of energy-consuming biosyntheses and releasing energy for defence and reparation needs.", "journal": "Journal of plant physiology", "date": "2014-04-02", "authors": ["VadimDemidchik"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jplph.2014.01.015"}

Although possible strain effects in semiconductors have been investigated for over a half-century, a profound understanding of their influence on energy bands, especially for large elastic strain remains unclear. In this study, a systematic investigation of the transport properties of n-type [0001] ZnO nanowires was performed at room temperature using the in situ scanning tunnelling microscope-transmission electron microscope technique which shows that the transport properties vary with the applied external uniaxial strain. It has been found that the resistance of ZnO nanowires decreases continuously with increasing compressive strain, but increases under increased tensile strain, suggesting piezo-resistive characteristics. A series of near-band-edge emissions were measured and the corresponding variations of bandgaps were obtained during the application of tensile strain of individual ZnO nanowires via cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. From this, a relationship between the changes of energy bandgap and the transport properties, both induced by uniaxial strain, is built.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2014-03-29", "authors": ["Rui-wenShao", "KunZheng", "BinWei", "Yue-feiZhang", "Yu-jieLi", "Xiao-dongHan", "ZeZhang", "JinZou"], "doi": "10.1039/c4nr00059e"}

{"title": "Development of a novel pulse wave velocity measurement system: using dual piezoelectric elements.", "abstract": "The aim of this study is to develop a painless system of measuring the brachial-ankle arterial pulse wave velocity (baPWV) without compression cuffs. The PWV reflects the compliance of the artery and is measured for the early diagnosis of arteriosclerotic vascular diseases. However, the conventional baPWV system, which measures four cuff pressures simultaneously, easily causes circulation block and tightening pain at the extremities. In addition, approximately 15 min are required to stabilise the blood pressure for re-examination. Therefore, we developed a novel baPWV measurement system using dual piezoelectric sensor elements. The principle of this high-sensitivity pressure pulse detection system is based on adding the two in-phase outputs from the coaxially arranged dual piezoelectric sensor. As our system facilitates the measurement of the baPWV by detecting the pulsation of an artery using sensors fixed on the skin where the pulse is palpable, it does not cause pain and reduces examination time. The coefficients of correlation between the baPWV values obtained from the conventional and present methods were 0.93 (right side) and 0.90 (left side).

Thus, smart materials respond to stimuli by altering one or more of their properties. Smart behaviour occurs when a material can sense some stimulus from its environment and react to it in a useful, reliable, reproducible, and usually reversible manner. These properties have a beneficial application in various fields including dentistry. Shape memory alloys, zirconia, and smartseal are examples of materials exhibiting a smart behavior in dentistry.

Pd nanoparticles are uniformly loaded on the whole surface of the ZnO nanowire arrays by a simple hydrothermal method. The piezoelectric output of the Pd/ZnO nanowire arrays can act as both the power source of the device and the room-temperature ethanol sensing signal. Upon exposure to 800 ppm ethanol gas at room temperature, the piezoelectric output voltage decreased from 0.52 V (in air) to 0.25 V. Such a room-temperature self-powered ethanol sensing behavior can be attributed to the catalytic effect of Pd, the Schottky barrier at the Pd/ZnO interface, and the piezotronics effect of the ZnO nanowires. Moreover, this flexible device can be driven by tiny mechanic energy in the environment, such as human finger movement. The present results can stimulate a research trend on designing new material systems and device structures in self-powered ethanol sensing at room temperature.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["YujieLin", "PingDeng", "YuxinNie", "YuefengHu", "LiliXing", "YanZhang", "XinyuXue"], "doi": "10.1039/c3nr06809a"}

Currently, the test most commonly used for endotoxin level determination is LAL (Limulus Amebocyte Lysate) assay. This paper presents application of commercially available low-frequency piezoelectric tuning forks (QTFs) for endotoxin detection. Measurement of the decrease in the QTF oscillation amplitude provides information about the viscosity changes, occurring in the tested sample upon addition of LAL. That method was used to determine the concentrations of endotoxins and bacterial cells (E. coli O157:H19). The relevance of the obtained results was confirmed using a commercially available colorimetric LAL assay. The constructed system can detect bacterial endotoxins in the range of 0.001-5EU/ml and bacterial cells in the range of 10(2)-10(7)CFU/ml. The presented technique requires very simple sample preparation and the sensor response is obtained using compact, portable readout electronics.

{"title": "Identifying polyvinylidene fluoride ultrafiltration membrane fouling behavior of different effluent organic matter fractions using colloidal probes.", "abstract": "The interaction forces between effluent organic matter (EfOM) fractions and membrane were measured by atomic force microscopy in conjunction with self-made membrane material colloidal probes. The inter-EfOM-fraction and intra-EfOM-fraction interactions were investigated using corresponding EfOM-fraction-coated colloidal probe. We combined this analysis with corresponding fouling experiments to identify the EfOM fractions responsible for polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membrane fouling. Results show that hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions were the dominant fractions responsible for membrane fouling and flux decline in the initial and later filtration stages, respectively, which was mainly attributed to the stronger PVDF-hydrophilic fraction and intra-hydrophobic-fraction interaction forces. This phenomenon, in conjunction with the fact that each interaction force of PVDF-EfOM fraction was stronger than corresponding intra-EfOM-fraction force, suggests that the elimination of the PVDF-hydrophilic fraction interaction force is the best strategy for controlling EfOM fouling. Moreover, the inter-EfOM-fraction interaction force was mainly controlled by the corresponding intra-EfOM-fraction interaction forces. And, while the membrane-EfOM fraction and intra-EfOM-fraction interactions for each type of EfOM fraction are equivalent, the EfOM fractions with the molecular weight smaller than the molecular weight cutoff of the membranes used were mainly responsible for membrane fouling rather than the relatively high-molecular-weight fractions.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["RuiMiao", "LeiWang", "YongtaoLv", "XudongWang", "LingFeng", "ZiwenLiu", "DanxiHuang", "YongzheYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2014.02.039"}

Piezoelectric accelerometer was used to measure the vibratory level on the face (nasal bridge and upper lip) and the perilaryngeal area during the production of nasal consonant /m/ and vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ before and after the resonant voice training. The extents of vibration of these four sounds among these three sites were compared.\nSignificant increase in facial bone vibration following resonant voice training was found. The nasal bridge showed a significantly larger magnitude of increase when compared with that at the upper lip. Different sounds were also found to facilitate different magnitude of facial bone vibration. Greater magnitude of facial bone vibration was found with the phonation of /m/, /i/, and /u/ when compared with the phonation of /a/.\nResonant voice training facilitated an increase in facial bone vibration, more so at the nasal bridge area than around the upper lip. This is hypothesized to contribute to the improved resonant voice production.

{"title": "A micro-optical system for endoscopy based on mechanical compensation paradigm using miniature piezo-actuation.", "abstract": "The goal of the study was to investigate the feasibility of a novel miniaturized optical system for endoscopy. Fostering the mechanical compensation paradigm, the modeled optical system, composed by 14 lenses, separated in 4 different sets, had a total length of 15.55mm, an effective focal length ranging from 1.5 to 4.5mm with a zoom factor of about 2.8\u00d7, and an angular field of view up to 56\u00b0. Predicted maximum lens travel was less than 3.5mm. The consistency of the image plane height across the magnification range testified the zoom capability. The maximum predicted achromatic astigmatism, transverse spherical aberration, longitudinal spherical aberration and relative distortion were less than or equal to 25\u03bcm, 15\u03bcm, 35\u03bcm and 12%, respectively. Tests on tolerances showed that the manufacturing and opto-mechanics mounting are critical as little deviations from design dramatically decrease the optical performances. However, recent micro-fabrication technology can guarantee tolerances close to nominal design. A closed-loop actuation unit, devoted to move the zoom and the focus lens sets, was implemented adopting miniaturized squiggle piezo-motors and magnetic position encoders based on Hall effect. Performance results, using a prototypical test board, showed a positioning accuracy of less than 5\u03bcm along a lens travel path of 4.0mm, which was in agreement with the lens set motion features predicted by the analysis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the feasibility of the optical design and the viability of the actuation approach while tolerances must be carefully taken into account.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["PietroCerveri", "Cynthia CorinnaZazzarini", "PaoloPatete", "GuidoBaroni"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2014.02.015"}

Imitating this process, this paper proposes a novel finger-shaped tactile sensor based on a thin piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film for surface texture measurement. A parallelogram mechanism is designed to ensure that the sensor applies a constant contact force perpendicular to the object surface, and a 2-dimensional movable mechanical structure is utilized to generate the relative motion at a certain speed between the sensor and the object surface. By controlling the 2-dimensional motion of the finger-shaped sensor along the object surface, small height/depth variation of surface texture changes the output charge of PVDF film then surface texture can be measured. In this paper, the finger-shaped tactile sensor is used to evaluate and classify five different kinds of linen. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is utilized to get original attribute data of surface in the frequency domain, and principal component analysis (PCA) is used to compress the attribute data and extract feature information. Finally, low dimensional features are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM).

However, the reliability of MEMS devices under buckling deformation environments remains elusive and needs to be further explored. Based on the Talreja's tensor valued internal state damage variables as well as the Helmhotlz free energy of piezoelectric material, a constitutive model of piezoelectric materials with damage is presented. The Kachanvo damage evolution law under in-plane compressive loads is employed. The model is applied to the specific case of the postbuckling analysis of the piezoelectric plate with damage. Then, adopting von Karman's plate theory, the nonlinear governing equations of the piezoelectric plates with initial geometric deflection including damage effects under in-plane compressive loads are established. By using the finite difference method and the Newmark scheme, the damage evolution for damage accumulation is developed and the finite difference procedure for postbuckling equilibrium path is simultaneously employed. Numerical results show the postbuckling behaviors of initial flat and deflected piezoelectric plates with damage or no damage under different sets of electrical loading conditions. The effects of applied voltage, aspect ratio of plate, thick-span ratio of plate, damage as well as initial geometric deflections on the postbuckling behaviors of the piezoelectric plate are discussed.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2014-03-13", "authors": ["ZhigangSun", "XianqiaoWang"], "doi": "10.3390/s140304876"}

However, their successful industrial scaling-up is still a challenge due to the limited pilot and commercial sonochemical reactors. In this work, a pilot reactor for laccase-hydrogen peroxide cotton bleaching assisted by ultrasound was scaled-up. For this purpose, an existing dyeing machine was transformed and adapted by including piezoelectric ultrasonic devices. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that both low frequency, high power (22 kHz, 2100 W) and high frequency, low power ultrasounds (850 kHz, 400 W) were required to achieve satisfactory results. Standard half (4 g/L H2O2 at 90 \u00b0C for 60 min) and optical (8 g/L H2O2 at 103 \u00b0C for 40 min) cotton bleaching processes were used as references. Two sequential stages were established for cotton bleaching: (1) laccase pretreatment assisted by high frequency ultrasound (850 kHz, 400 W) and (2) bleaching using high power ultrasound (22 kHz, 2100 W). When compared with conventional methods, combined laccase-hydrogen peroxide cotton bleaching with ultrasound energy improved the whitening effectiveness. Subsequently, less energy (temperature) and chemicals (hydrogen peroxide) were needed for cotton bleaching thus resulting in costs reduction. This technology allowed the combination of enzyme and hydrogen peroxide treatment in a continuous process. The developed pilot-scale reactor offers an enhancement of the cotton bleaching process with lower environmental impact as well as a better performance of further finishing operations.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2014-03-13", "authors": ["IdalinaGon\u00e7alves", "VictorHerrero-Yniesta", "IratxePerales Arce", "MonicaEscrigas Casta\u00f1eda", "ArturCavaco-Paulo", "CarlaSilva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2014.02.009"}

Previous studies have indicated, however, that Al and cathode materials were quite difficult to separate due to the strong binding force supplied by the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which was employed to bind cathode materials and Al foil. This research devoted to seek a new method of melting the PVDF binder with heated ionic liquid (IL) to separate Al foil and cathode materials from the spent high-power LiBs. Theoretical analysis based on Fourier's law was adopted to determine the heat transfer mechanism of cathode material and to examine the relationship between heating temperature and retention time. All the experimental and theoretic results show that peel-off rate of cathode materials from Al foil could reach 99% when major process parameters were controlled at 180\u00b0C heating temperature, 300 rpm agitator rotation, and 25 min retention time. The results further imply that the application of IL for recycling Al foil and cathode materials from spent high-power LiBs is highly efficient, regardless of the application source of the LiBs or the types of cathode material.

Meshes were tested either in warp direction (parallel to production direction) or perpendicular to the warp direction. A Zwick testing machine was used to measure elasticity and effective porosity of the textile probes. Stretching of the meshes in warp direction required forces that were up to 85-fold higher than the same elongation in perpendicular direction. Stretch stress led to loss of effective porosity in most meshes, except for PVDF-S. Biomechanical impact of the mesh was additionally evaluated in a hiatal hernia model. The different meshes were used either as rectangular patches or as circular meshes. Circular meshes led to a significant reinforcement of the hiatus, largely unaffected by the orientation of the warp fibers. In contrast, rectangular meshes provided a significant reinforcement only when warp fibers ran perpendicular to the crura.

{"title": "Boron nitride nanotube-functionalised myoblast/microfibre constructs: a nanotech-assisted tissue-engineered platform for muscle stimulation.", "abstract": "In this communication, we introduce boron nitride nanotube (BNNT)-functionalised muscle cell/microfibre mesh constructs, obtained via tissue engineering, as a three-dimensional (3D) platform to study a wireless stimulation system for electrically responsive cells and tissues. Our stimulation strategy exploits the piezoelectric behaviour of some classes of ceramic nanoparticles, such as BNNTs, able to polarize under mechanical stress, e.g. using low-frequency ultrasound (US). In the microfibre scaffolds, C2C12 myoblasts were able to differentiate into viable myotubes and to internalize BNNTs, also upon US irradiation, so as to obtain a nanotech-assisted 3D in vitro model. We then tested our stimulatory system on 2D and 3D cellular models by investigating the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), as a molecule involved in cell crosstalk and mechanotransduction, and myosin, as a myogenic differentiation marker. Cx43 gene expression revealed a marked model dependency. In control samples (without US and/or BNNTs), Cx43 was upregulated under 2D culture conditions (10.78\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05-fold difference). Interactions with BNNTs increased Cx43 expression in 3D samples. Cx43 mRNA dropped in 2D under the 'BNNTs\u2009+\u2009US' regimen, while it was best enhanced in 3D samples (3.58\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05 vs 13.74\u2009\u00b1\u20091.42-fold difference, p\u2009=\u20090.0001).

The piezoelectric output generated by ZnO NW NG can act not only as a power source for driving the device, but also as a biosensing signal. After immersing in 10(-3) g ml(-1) human immunoglobulin G (IgG), the piezoelectric output voltage of the device under compressive deformation decreases from 0.203\u00b10.0176 V (without IgG) to 0.038\u00b10.0035 V. Such a self-powered biosensor has higher response than transistor-type biosensor (I-V behavior). The response of self-powered biosensor is in a linear relationship with IgG concentration (logarithm, 10(-7)-10(-3) g ml(-1)) and the limit of detection (LOD) on IgG of the device is about 6.9 ng ml(-1). The adsorption of biomolecules on the surface of ZnO NWs can modify the free-carrier density, which vary the screening effect of free-carriers on the piezoelectric output.

{"title": "Production of a high-velocity water slug using an impacting technique.", "abstract": "A pulsed water jet consists of a series of discrete water slugs travelling at high velocity. Immediately after striking a target, these slugs apply high-intensity, short-duration transient stress pulses reaching an amplitude known as the water hammer pressure, followed by low-intensity, long-duration stationary stress at a lower stagnation pressure. The magnitude and duration of the water hammer and stagnation pressures are controlled by the size and quality of the water slugs. The use of water jets for rock cutting in mining operations is a centuries-old technology; however, practical methods for producing high-energy water slugs repeatedly have proven difficult. This can be partly due to the fact that the geometrical properties of a jet and so its effectiveness in creating damage is controlled and influenced by the method that is employed to generate the water slugs. This paper investigates the quality of a single water slug produced using an impacting technique where a hammer strikes a piston, resting on top of a water-filled chamber. The coherence and integrity of the jet core was of concern in this study. The impact impulse of the formed water jet was measured in a Kel-F target material using an embedded PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) shock gauge. The recorded stress waveform was then used to determine the unity and endurance of the water slug stream once travelled through air.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2014-03-07", "authors": ["SDehkhoda", "N KBourne"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4865402"}

{"title": "Measurement of the internal stress and electric field in a resonating piezoelectric transformer for high-voltage applications using the electro-optic and photoelastic effects.", "abstract": "The high output voltages from piezoelectric transformers are currently being used to accelerate charged particle beams for x-ray and neutron production. Traditional methods of characterizing piezoelectric transformers (PTs) using electrical probes can decrease the voltage transformation ratio of the device due to the introduction of load impedances on the order of hundreds of kiloohms to hundreds of megaohms. Consequently, an optical diagnostic was developed that used the photoelastic and electro-optic effects present in piezoelectric materials that are transparent to a given optical wavelength to determine the internal stress and electric field. The combined effects of the piezoelectric, photoelastic, and electro-optic effects result in a time-dependent change the refractive indices of the material and produce an artificially induced, time-dependent birefringence in the piezoelectric material. This induced time-dependent birefringence results in a change in the relative phase difference between the ordinary and extraordinary wave components of a helium-neon laser beam. The change in phase difference between the wave components was measured using a set of linear polarizers. The measured change in phase difference was used to calculate the stress and electric field based on the nonlinear optical properties, the piezoelectric constitutive equations, and the boundary conditions of the PT. Maximum stresses of approximately 10 MPa and electric fields of as high as 6 kV/cm were measured with the optical diagnostic. Measured results were compared to results from both a simple one-dimensional (1D) model of the piezoelectric transformer and a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model. Measured stresses and electric fields along the length of an operating length-extensional PT for two different electrical loads were within at least 50 % of 3D finite element simulated results. Additionally, the 3D finite element results were more accurate than the results from the 1D model for a wider range of electrical load impedances under test.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2014-03-07", "authors": ["James AVanGordon", "Scott DKovaleski", "PeterNorgard", "Brady BGall", "Gregory EDale"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4864052"}

Postprocessing techniques including biaxial orientation and melt recrystallization were used to tune the crystal orientation of the PVDF-TFE layers, as well as achieve crystallinity in the PET layers through strain-induced crystallization and thermal annealing during the melt recrystallization step. A volume additive model was used to extract the effect of crystal orientation within the PVDF-TFE layers and revealed a significant enhancement in the modulus from 730 MPa in the as-extruded state (isotropic) to 840 MPa in the biaxially oriented state (on-edge) to 2230 MPa in the melt-recrystallized state (in-plane). Subsequently, in situ wide-angle X-ray scattering was used to observe the crystal structure evolution during uniaxial deformation in both the as-extruded and melt-recrystallized states. It is observed that the low-temperature ferroelectric PVDF-TFE crystal phase in the as-extruded state exhibits equatorial sharpening of the 110 and 200 crystal peaks during deformation, quantified using the Hermans orientation function, while in the melt-recrystallized state, an overall increase in the crystallinity occurs during deformation. Thus, we correlated the mechanical response (strain hardening) of the films to these respective evolved crystal structures and highlighted the ability to tailor mechanical response. With a better understanding of the structural evolution during deformation, it is possible to more fully characterize the structural response to handling during use of the high-barrier PVDF-TFE/PET multilayer films as commercial dielectrics and packaging materials.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2014-03-07", "authors": ["Alex MJordan", "William RLenart", "Joel MCarr", "EricBaer", "Lashanda T JKorley"], "doi": "10.1021/am4053893"}

For measurements a planar piezoelectric transducer with a diameter of 20 mm and a resonance frequency of 1.06 MHz was used. The transducer generated tone bursts with 94 \u03bcs duration, 0.4 duty-cycle and initial intensity ISATA (spatial averaged, temporal averaged) varied from 0.33 W/cm(2) to 8 W/cm(2) (average acoustic power varied from 1 W to 24 W). The rat C6 glioma cells were cultured on a bottom of wells in 12-well plates, incubated for 24h and then exposed to ultrasound with measured acoustic properties, inducing or causing no thermal effects leading to cell death. Cell viability rate was determined by MTT assay (a standard colorimetric assay for assessing cell viability) as the ratio of the optical densities of the group treated by ultrasound to the control group. Structural cellular changes and apoptosis estimation were observed under a microscope. Quantitative analysis of the obtained results allowed to determine the maximal exposure time that does not lead to the thermal effects above 43 \u00b0C in the region of cells for each initial intensity of the tone bursts used as well as the threshold intensity causing cell death after 3 min exposure to ultrasound due to thermal effects.

This rationale increases the speed of first-principles piezo-coefficient calculations by an order of magnitude. At the same time, it suggests how to understand and further increase the piezo-response.

{"title": "Hydrophilic fraction of natural organic matter causing irreversible fouling of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes.", "abstract": "Although membrane filtration is a promising technology in the field of drinking water treatment, persistent membrane fouling remains a major disadvantage. For more efficient operation, causative agents of membrane fouling need to be identified. Membrane fouling can be classified into physically reversible and irreversible fouling on basis of the removability of the foulants by physical cleaning. Four types of natural organic matter (NOM) in river water used as a source of drinking water were fractionated into hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions, and their potential to develop irreversible membrane fouling was evaluated by a bench-scale filtration experiment together with spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses. In this study, only dissolved NOM was investigated without consideration of interactions of NOM fractions with particulate matter. Results demonstrated that despite identical total organic carbon (TOC), fouling development trends were significantly different between hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions. The hydrophobic fractions did not increase membrane resistance, while the hydrophilic fractions caused severe loss of membrane permeability. These results were identical with the case when the calcium was added to hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions. The largest difference in NOM characteristics between hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions was the presence or absence of macromolecules; the primary constituent causing irreversible fouling was inferred to be \"biopolymers\", including carbohydrates and proteins. In addition, the results demonstrated that the extent of irreversible fouling was considerably different depending on the combination of membrane materials and NOM characteristics. Despite identical nominal pore size (0.1\u00a0\u03bcm), a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was found to be more rapidly fouled than a PE membrane. This is probably explained by the generation of strong hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups of biopolymers and fluorine of the PVDF membrane. On the basis of these findings, it was suggested that the higher fouling potential of the hydrophilic fraction of the dissolved NOMs from various natural water sources are mainly attributed to macromolecules, or biopolymers.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2014-02-26", "authors": ["HiroshiYamamura", "KenjiOkimoto", "KatsukiKimura", "YoshimasaWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2014.01.024"}
{"title": "Applications of piezoelectric surgery in endodontic surgery: a literature review.", "abstract": "Piezosurgery (piezoelectric bone surgery) devices were developed to cut bone atraumatically using ultrasonic vibrations and to provide an alternative to the mechanical and electrical instruments used in conventional oral surgery. Indications for piezosurgery are increasing in oral and maxillofacial surgery, as in other disciplines, such as endodontic surgery. Key features of piezosurgery instruments include their ability to selectively cut bone without damaging adjacent soft tissue, to provide a clear operative field, and to cut without generating heat. Although piezosurgery instruments can be used at most stages of endodontic surgery (osteotomy, root-end resection, and root-end preparation), no published data are available on the effect of piezosurgery on the outcomes of endodontic surgery. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of piezosurgery on root-end resection, and only 1 has investigated root-end morphology after retrograde cavity preparation using piezosurgery.\nWe conducted a search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases using appropriate terms and keywords related to the use and applications of piezoelectric surgery in endodontic surgery. A hand search also was conducted of issues published in the preceding 2 years of several journals. Two independent reviewers obtained and analyzed the full texts of the selected articles.\nA total of 121 articles published between January 2000 and December 2013 were identified. This review summarizes the operating principles of piezoelectric devices and outlines the applications of piezosurgery in endodontic surgery using clinical examples.\nPiezosurgery is a promising technical modality with applications in several aspects of endodontic surgery, but further studies are necessary to determine the influence of piezosurgery on root-end resection and root-end preparation.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2014-02-26", "authors": ["FrancescAbella", "Joande Ribot", "GuillermoDoria", "FernandoDuran-Sindreu", "MiguelRoig"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2013.11.014"}

Elastomeric PVDF-HFP samples were electrospun to evaluate their potential use as small diameter artificial vascular graft scaffold (SDAVG) and compared with solvent cast (SC) PVDF-HFP films. We examined the consequences of fibrinogen adsorption onto the ES and SC samples for endothelialisation. Bone marrow derived endothelial cells (BMEC) of human origin were incubated with the test and control samples and their attachment, proliferation, and viability were examined. The nature of interaction of fibrinogen with SC and ES samples was investigated in detail using ELISA, XPS, and FTIR techniques. The pristine SC and ES PVDF-HFP samples displayed hydrophobic and ultrahydrophobic behavior and accordingly, exhibited minimal BMEC growth. Fibrinogen adsorbed SC samples did not significantly enhance endothelial cell binding or proliferation. In contrast, the fibrinogen adsorbed electrospun surfaces showed a clear ability to modulate endothelial cell behavior. This system also represents an ideal model system that enables us to understand the natural interaction between cells and their extracellular environment.

Here, we discuss a comparative analysis based on the m-plane and the c-plane oriented InGaN/GaN MQW NW arrays. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the barrier and the well structures of MQW were observed to be substantially clear with regular intervals while the interface regions were extremely sharp. The c-plane and m-plane oriented MQW single NW was utilized for the parallel assembly fabrication of the LEDs via a focused ion beam. The polarization induced effects on the c-plane and m-plane oriented MQW NWs were precisely compared via power dependence electroluminescence. The electrical properties of m-plane NWs exhibited superior characteristics than that of c-plane NWs owing to the absence of piezoelectric polarization fields.

{"title": "Fragmented carbon nanotube macrofilms as adhesive conductors for lithium-ion batteries.", "abstract": "Polymer binders such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and conductive additives such as carbon black (CB) are indispensable components for manufacturing battery electrodes in addition to active materials. The concept of adhesive conductors employing fragmented carbon nanotube macrofilms (FCNTs) is demonstrated by constructing composite electrodes with a typical active material, LiMn2O4. The adhesive FCNT conductors provide not only a high electrical conductivity but also a strong adhesive force, functioning simultaneously as both the conductive additives and the binder materials for lithium-ion batteries. Such composite electrodes exhibit superior high-rate and retention capabilities compared to the electrodes using a conventional binder (PVDF) and a conductive additive (CB). An in situ tribology method combining wear track imaging and force measurement is employed to evaluate the adhesion strength of the adhesive FCNT conductors. The adhesive FCNT conductors exhibit higher adhesion strength than PVDF. It has further been confirmed that the adhesive FCNT conductor can be used in both cathodes and anodes and is proved to be a competent substitute for polymer binders to maintain mechanical integrity and at the same time to provide electrical connectivity of active materials in the composite electrodes.

Pt nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the whole surface of ZnO nanowires. The piezoelectric output of Pt/ZnO nanoarrays can act not only as a power source, but also as a response signal to ethanol at room temperature. Upon exposure to dry air and 1500\u00a0ppm ethanol at room temperature, the piezoelectric output of the device under the same compressive strain is 0.672 and 0.419\u00a0V, respectively. Moreover, a linear dependence of the sensitivity on the ethanol concentration is observed. Such a linear ethanol sensing at room temperature can be attributed to the atmosphere-dependent variety of the screen effect on the piezoelectric output of ZnO nanowires, the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles, and the Schottky barriers at Pt/ZnO interfaces.

A sublayer model based on the piecewise linear approximation for the electric potential is used to describe the nonlinear distribution of electric potential through the thickness of the piezoelectric layers. An equivalent single layer (ESL) model based on first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is used to describe the displacement field. The Legendre orthogonal polynomials of order 5 are used in the element interpolation functions. The validity and the capability of the present SE model for investigation of global and local responses of the piezoelectric bimorph are confirmed by comparing the present solutions with those obtained from coupled 3-D finite element (FE) analysis. It is shown that, without introducing any higher-order electric potential assumptions, the current method can accurately describe the distribution of the electric potential across the thickness even for a rather thick bimorph. It is revealed that the effect of electric potential is significant when the bimorph is used as sensor while the effect is insignificant when the bimorph is used as actuator, and therefore, the present study may provide a better understanding of the nonlinear induced electric potential for bimorph sensor and actuator.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2014-02-25", "authors": ["XingjianDong", "ZhikePeng", "HongxingHua", "GuangMeng"], "doi": "10.3390/s140203477\n10.1177/1045389X13486713"}

Given the major substrate-induced modification of properties and considerable energy transfer at the interface, the graphene-substrate interaction has been widely discussed. However, the proposed mechanisms were restricted to the two-dimensional (2D) plane and interface, while the energy conduction in the third dimension is hardly considered. Herein, we disclose the transfer of energy perpendicular to the interface of the combined system of the 2D graphene and the 3D base. More precisely, our observation of the energy dissipation of optically excited graphene via emitting out-of-plane longitudinal acoustic phonon into the substrate is presented. By applying nanoultrasonic spectroscopy with a piezoelectric nanolayer embedded in the substrate, we found that under photoexcitation by a femtosecond laser pulse graphene can emit longitudinal coherent acoustic phonons (CAPs) with frequencies over 1 THz into the substrate. In addition, the waveform of the CAP pulse infers that the photocarriers and sudden lattice heating in graphene caused modification of graphene-substrate bond and consequently generated longitudinal acoustic phonons in the substrate.

{"title": "Molecular calipers for highly precise and accurate measurements of single-protein mechanics.", "abstract": "Single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) has evolved into a powerful technique toward elucidating conformational changes in proteins when exposed to applied force. AFM technologies that are currently available allow for precise measurements of proteins length changes during conformational transitions. However, because of systematic errors in piezo calibration as well as errors originating from fitting experimental data using a worm-like chain model of polymer elasticity, high-precision measurements of length changes do not necessarily translate into highly accurate measurements of length changes, resulting in uncertainty in obtaining structural information about protein conformational changes. Actually achieving highly precise and accurate force spectroscopy measurements remains a challenge. Here, we report a protein caliper method that eliminates systematic errors that occur during single-protein force spectroscopy measurements, and thus achieves highly precise and accurate length change measurements in protein mechanics studies. To do this, a series of loop elongation variants of the small protein GB1, which differ by 2, 5, 10, 15, and 24 amino acid residues, were engineered. Differential measurements of amino acid residue length obtained from different AFM setups result in a precise measure of the length of a single amino acid residue, which varies within different AFM setups because of systematic error between individual AFM piezoelectric calibrations. The measured length of a single amino acid residue from a given AFM setup is then used as a caliper for the given setup to eliminate systematic error, leading to highly accurate and precise measurements of the number of amino acid residues that are involved in a conformation change of a polypeptide chain. We further developed a more precise, robust, and model-free method to determine the apparent size of single amino acid residues and conformational changes of proteins.

The traditional high-powered pneumatic tools and saws are efficient in terms of speed and penetration, but they can provoke bone necrosis and sometimes damage neurovascular structures. As an alternative, we evaluated the piezoelectric bone scalpel (piezosurgery), a device that potentially allows thinner and more precise bone cutting without lesioning neighboring delicate structures, even in the case of accidental contact.\nFrom January 2009 to December 2011, 20 patients (8 men and 12 women), 19 to 72 years of age (mean: 49.3 years) were treated using piezosurgery.

PIMT expression in these extracts was measured by Western blot, and its specific activity was assayed by monitoring the rate of [(3)H]methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-[methyl-(3)H]L-methionine to \u03b3-globulin. Isoaspartate levels in extracts were measured by their capacity to accept [(3)H]methyl groups via the PIMT-catalyzed methylation reaction. To compare molecular weight distributions of isoaspartyl-rich proteins in retina versus brain, proteins from PIMT knockout (KO) and control mice were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). Isoaspartyl proteins were (3)H-labeled on-blot using a PIMT overlay and imaged by autoradiography.\nWhen normalized to the \u03b2-actin content of each tissue, retina was found to be nearly identical to brain with regard to expression and activity of PIMT and its propensity to accumulate isoaspartyl sites when PIMT is absent. The two tissues show distinct differences in the molecular weight distribution of isoaspartyl proteins.\nThe retina is rich in PIMT activity and contains a wide range of proteins that are highly susceptible to this type of protein damage.

{"title": "Piezo2 expression in corneal afferent neurons.", "abstract": "Recently, a novel class of mechanically sensitive channels has been identified and have been called Piezo channels. In this study, we explored Piezo channel expression in sensory neurons supplying the guinea pig corneal epithelium, which have well-defined modalities in this species. We hypothesized that a proportion of corneal afferent neurons express Piezo2, and that these neurons are neurochemically distinct from corneal polymodal nociceptors or cold-sensing neurons. We used a combination of retrograde tracing to identify corneal afferent neurons and double label in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry to determine their molecular and/or neurochemical profile. We found that Piezo2 expression occurs in \u223c26% of trigeminal ganglion neurons and 30% of corneal afferent neurons. Piezo2 corneal afferent neurons are almost exclusively non-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive (-IR), medium- to large-sized neurons that are NF200-IR, suggesting they are not corneal polymodal nociceptors. There was no coexpression of Piezo2 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) transcripts in any corneal afferent neurons, further suggesting that Piezo2 is not expressed in corneal cold-sensing neurons. We also noted that TRPM8-IR or CGRP-IR corneal afferent neurons are almost entirely small and lack NF200-IR. Piezo2 expression occurs in a neurochemically distinct subpopulation of corneal afferent neurons that are not polymodal nociceptors or cold-sensing neurons, and is likely confined to a subpopulation of pure mechano-nociceptors in the cornea.

The charge capacity of the PVDF-PZT nanocomposite film based SCPC in 240 s is \u223c0.010 \u03bcA h, higher than that of a pure PVDF film based SCPC (\u223c0.004 \u03bcA h).

The resultant GO-NH2 maintained a high surface area of 320 m(2)/g. When used as an adsorbent, the GO-NH2 demonstrated a very quick adsorption property for the removal of Co(II) ions, more than 90% of Co(II) ions could be removed within 5 min for dilute solutions at 0.3g/L adsorbent dose. The adsorption capability approaches 116.35 mg/g, which is one of the highest capabilities of today's materials. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from temperature-dependent adsorption isotherms suggested that the Co(II) ions adsorption on GO-NH2 was a spontaneous process. Considering the superior adsorption capability, the GO-NH2 filter membrane was fabricated for the removal of Co(II) ions. Membrane filtration experiments revealed that the removal capabilities of the materials for cobalt ions depended on the membrane's thickness, flow rate and initial concentration of Co(II) ions.

In order to increase the speed of the sensing system in comparison with the standard realization based on the postprocessing of the captured interferometric signal, a real-time algorithm based on the modified centroid algorithm has been implemented. The modified centroid algorithm generates the error signal that is proportional to the interferometer optical path difference (OPD) during every scan of the used white-light source coherence zone. In order to keep zero OPD, an amplified version of the error signal has been brought to the input of the piezo bimorph actuator (PBA) that on the other side serves for the fast coherence zone scan. In this way the PBA tracks the position of the object whose displacement is to be measured. Therefore, the voltage signal at the PBA input is proportional to the measured displacement.

Twenty-four measurements for healthy volunteers and those with AD by this system were evaluated by comparison with a simultaneously recorded video analysis system. The ratio of scratching time in sleeping time evaluated by these two systems was almost identical. The healthy subjects scratched their skin approximately 2 min during 6 h of sleeping time, while the mean scratching time of AD subjects was 24 min in their sleeping time.

{"title": "Modeling of micromachined silicon-polymer 2-2 composite matching layers for 15MHz ultrasound transducers.", "abstract": "Silicon-polymer composites fabricated by micromachining technology offer attractive properties for use as matching layers in high frequency ultrasound transducers. Understanding of the acoustic behavior of such composites is essential for using them as one of the layers in a multilayered transducer structure. This paper presents analytical and finite element models of the acoustic properties of silicon-polymer composites in 2-2 connectivity. Analytical calculations based on partial wave solutions are applied to identify the resonance modes and estimate effective acoustic material properties. Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations were used to investigate the interaction between the composite and the surrounding load medium, either a fluid or a solid, with emphasis on the acoustic impedance of the composite. Composites with lateral periods of 20, 40 and 80\u03bcm were fabricated and used as acoustic matching layers for air-backed transducers operating at 15MHz. These composites were characterized acoustically, and the results were compared with analytical calculations. The analytical model shows that at low to medium silicon volume fraction, the first lateral resonance in the silicon-polymer 2-2 composite is defined by the composite period, and this lateral resonant frequency is at least 1.2 times higher than that of a piezo-composite with the same polymer filler. FEM simulations showed that the effective acoustic impedance of the silicon-polymer composite varies with frequency, and that it also depends on the load material, especially whether this is a fluid or a solid. The estimated longitudinal sound velocities of the 20 and 40\u03bcm period composites match the results from analytical calculations within 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. The effective acoustic impedances of the 20 and 40\u03bcm period composites were found to be 10% and 26% lower than the values from the analytical calculations.

Furthermore, variations in the number of data values used for the fit introduced no more than 3.1% uncertainty on the calculated material parameters. It is found that the complex material parameters of PMN-PT composite are more dependent on temperature than the single crystal.

Qualitative and quantitative studies of fibrinogen adsorption were performed using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), while SEM, aggregometry, and liquid scintillation analyses were performed to evaluate platelet adhesion, aggregation, and serotonin release. While little or no platelet adhesion was observed on pristine ES surfaces, considerable adhesion, and measurable aggregation and serotonin release were observed on pristine SC surfaces. Notably, increased adhesion of platelets was observed following fibrinogen adsorption on SC surface with considerable aggregation and serotonin release compared with ES samples, where limited aggregation and platelet adhesion was observed.

SC surfaces showed enhanced platelet adhesion, aggregation, and serotonin release compared to ES surfaces. This study shows that the morphology of samples plays a critical role on the biocompatibility of samples by altering the adsorption and adhesion of biomolecules and cells.

While the promise of the technology is intriguing, it is yet to be realized. Many challenges remain to be addressed to allow these methods to meet technical and research expectations, provide reliable assay answers, and to reliably diversify their capabilities. Critical issues include: (1) inconsistent printed microspot morphologies and uniformities, (2) low signal-to-noise ratios due to factors such as complex surface capture protocols, contamination, and static or no-flow mass transport conditions, (3) inconsistent quantification of captured signal due to spot uniformity issues, (4) non-optimal protocol conditions such as pH, temperature, drying that promote variability in assay kinetics, and lastly (5) poor protein (e.g., antibody) printing, storage, or shelf-life compatibility with common microarray assay fabrication methods, directly related to microarray protocols.

Among the HA-70 fragments, HA-33/HA-17 bound to those containing at least the C-terminal half of the HA-70 molecule, but not those carrying the N-terminal half. Additional docking simulation analysis indicated that the HA-70 region Gln420-Tyr575 is responsible for binding to HA-17, which is consistent with the far-western blot data.

Moreover, mesh shrinkage during subsequent wound healing cannot be detected in vivo without invasive diagnostics. Using MRI-visible polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh, the extend of mesh deformation and shrinkage could be objectified by MRI for the first time.\nLaparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) implantation was performed in 10 female rabbits using ferro-oxide loaded PVDF meshes.

After three-dimensional reconstruction of all MRI images the total surface and the effective surface of the implanted mesh were explored and calculated computer-assisted.\nIn all cases, the mesh could be identified in MRI. The subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction always allowed a calculation of the mesh area. In relation to the original size of the used textile implant, we found neither a significant reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of the pneumoperitoneum at day 1 after laparoscopic surgery nor a significant change of the total surface of this large pore mesh by the end of the observation period.\nIn vivo investigation of mesh surface via MRI could exclude a significant initial reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of pneumoperitoneum, in this IPOM rabbit model.

The study investigated 938 teeth in 843 patients. On the basis of the procedure performed, the teeth were grouped in 3 groups. Differences between the groups were the method of osteotomy (type of instruments used), type of preparation of retrograde cavity (different apicoectomy angles and instruments used for root-end preparation), and root-end filling material used (gray mineral trioxide aggregate or silver amalgam). Outcome (tooth healing) was estimated after 1 and 5 years, postoperatively. Clinical success rates after 1 year were 67% (306 teeth), 90% (186 teeth), and 94% (256 teeth) according to traditional apicoectomy (group 1), modern microsurgical apicoectomy using burns for osteotomy (group 2) or using piezo-osteotomy (group 3), respectively. After 1 year, group comparison results were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Linear trend test was also statistically significant (P < 0.0001), pointing out larger healing from group 1 to group 3.

Recently, such magnetoelectric control was realized in multiferroics. However, their magnetoelectric switching is often accompanied by significant hysteresis, resulting from a large barrier, separating different ferroic states. Hysteresis prevents robust switching, unless the applied field overcomes a certain value (coercive field). Here we address the role of a switching barrier on magnetoelectric control, and identify a material, collinear antiferromagnetic and pyroelectric Ni3TeO6, in which magnetoelectric switching occurs without hysteresis. The barrier between two magnetic states in the vicinity of a spin-flop transition is almost flat, and thus small changes in external electric/magnetic fields allow to switch the ferroic state through an intermediate state in a continuous manner, resulting in a colossal magnetoelectric response. This colossal magnetoelectric effect resembles the large piezoelectric effect at the morphotropic phase boundary in ferroelectrics.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2014-01-29", "authors": ["Yoon SeokOh", "SergeyArtyukhin", "Jun JieYang", "VivienZapf", "Jae WookKim", "DavidVanderbilt", "Sang-WookCheong"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms4201"}

{"title": "Performance of tonpilz transducers with segmented piezoelectric stacks using materials with high electromechanical coupling coefficient.", "abstract": "Tonpilz acoustic transducers for use underwater often include a stack of piezoelectric material pieces polarized along the length of the stack and having alternating polarity. The pieces are interspersed with electrodes, bonded together, and electrically connected in parallel. The stack is normally much shorter than a quarter wavelength at the fundamental resonance frequency so that the mechanical behavior of the transducer is not affected by the segmentation. When the transducer bandwidth is less than a half octave, as has conventionally been the case, for example, with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) material, stack segmentation has no significant effect on the mechanical behavior of the device in its normal operating band near the fundamental resonance. However, when a high coupling coefficient material such as lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) is used to achieve a wider bandwidth with the tonpilz, the performance difference between a segmented stack and a similar piezoelectric section with electrodes only at the two ends can be significant. This paper investigates the effects of stack segmentation on the performance of wideband underwater tonpilz acoustic transducers. Included is a discussion of a particular tonpilz transducer design using single crystal piezoelectric material with high coupling coefficient compared with a similar design using more traditional PZT ceramics.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2014-01-21", "authors": ["Stephen CThompson", "Richard JMeyer", "Douglas CMarkley"], "doi": "10.1121/1.4837217"}

In this article we report on the blends composed by corn starch and poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, or poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene), P(VDF-TrFE), to obtain biocompatible materials. Blends were produced by compressing/annealing and chemically/structurally characterized by micro-Raman scattering and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectroscopies, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), besides in vivo study to evaluate the tissue response. Vibrational spectroscopy reveals no chemical interaction between the polymers and starch, absence of material degradation due to compressing/annealing process or organism implantation, and maintenance of \u03b1 and ferroelectric crystalline phases of PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE), respectively. As a consequence of absence of interaction between polymers and starch, it was possible to identify by SEM each material, with starch acting as filler.

In this study, we demonstrate that EZH2 is overexpressed in OSCC cells and clinical tissue. With in vitro RNAi analysis, we generated stable EZH2 knocking down cell lines from two OSCC cell lines, with two sh-RNAs targeting to EZH2, respectively. We found that knocking down of EZH2 could decrease the proliferation ability and induce apoptosis of OSCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that of EZH2 inhibition decreased the migration and metastasis of OSCC cells.

One goal of sample preparation for mass spec is to reduce the complexity of the sample - in the example presented here, mitochondria are purified, solubilized, and fractionated by sucrose density gradient sedimentation prior to preparative 1D SDS-PAGE. It is important to verify the purity and integrity of the sample so that you can have confidence in the hits obtained.

{"title": "Strain response of magnetic order in perovskite-type oxide films.", "abstract": "The role of elastic strain for magnetoelectric materials and devices is twofold. It can induce ferroic orders in thin films of otherwise non-ferroic materials. On the other hand, it provides the most exploited coupling mechanism in two-phase magnetoelectric materials and devices today. Complex oxide films (perovskites, spinels) are promising for both routes. The strain control of magnetic order in complex oxide films is a young research field, and few ab initio simulations are available for magnetic order in dependence on lattice parameters and lattice symmetry. Here, an experimental approach for the evaluation of how elastic strain in thin epitaxial films alters their magnetic order is introduced. The magnetic films are grown epitaxially in strain states controlled by buffer layers onto piezoelectric substrates of 0.72Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3(001). As an example, the strain dependence of the ordered magnetic moment of SrRuO3 has been investigated. At a tensile strain level of approximately 1%, SrRuO3 is tetragonal, and biaxial elastic strain induces a pronounced suppression of the ordered magnetic moment.

The crystalline morphology and the crystallization driven demixing in the blends was assessed by light microscopy (LM), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) and, in situ, by shear rheology. The crystal nucleation activity of PVDF was greatly induced by NH2-MWNTs, which also showed two distinct structural relaxations in dielectric loss owing to mobility confinement of PVDF chains and smaller cooperative lengths. The presence of crystal-amorphous interphase was supported by the presence of interfacial polarization at lower frequencies in the dielectric loss spectra. On contrary, the control blends showed a single broad relaxation at higher frequency due to defective crystal nuclei. This was further supported by monitoring the dielectric relaxations during isothermal crystallization of PVDF in the blends. These observations were addressed with respect to the spherulite sizes which were observed to be larger in case of blends with NH2-MWNTs. Higher dielectric permittivity with minimal losses was also observed in blends with NH2-MWNTs as compared to neat PVDF. Polarization obtained using P-E (polarization-electric field) hysteresis loops was higher in case of blends with NH2-MWNTs in contrast to control blends and PVDF.

The nanocomposites exhibit enhanced permittivity, reduced loss tangents and improved breakdown electric field strength at a low volume fraction of hydroxylated BST60 NF.

Such significant enhancements result from combined effect of the large aspect ratio, the surface modification and the improved crystallinity of the nanocomposites induced by the hydroxylated BST60 NF.

{"title": "Improved measurement of acoustic output using complex deconvolution of hydrophone sensitivity.", "abstract": "The traditional method for calculating acoustic pressure amplitude is to divide a hydrophone output voltage measurement by the hydrophone sensitivity at the acoustic working frequency, but this approach neglects frequency dependence of hydrophone sensitivity. Another method is to perform a complex deconvolution between the hydrophone output waveform and the hydrophone impulse response (the inverse Fourier transform of the sensitivity). In this paper, the effects of deconvolution on measurements of peak compressional pressure (p+), peak rarefactional pressure (p_), and pulse intensity integral (PII) are studied. Time-delay spectrometry (TDS) was used to measure complex sensitivities from 1 to 40 MHz for 8 hydrophones used in medical ultrasound exposimetry. These included polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) spot-poled membrane, needle, capsule, and fiber-optic designs. Subsequently, the 8 hydrophones were used to measure a 4-cycle, 3 MHz pressure waveform mimicking a pulsed Doppler waveform. Acoustic parameters were measured for the 8 hydrophones using the traditional approach and deconvolution. Average measurements (across all 8 hydrophones) of acoustic parameters from deconvolved waveforms were 4.8 MPa (p+), 2.4 MPa (p_), and 0.21 mJ/cm(2) (PII). Compared with the traditional method, deconvolution reduced the coefficient of variation (ratio of standard deviation to mean across all 8 hydrophones) from 29% to 8% (p+), 39% to 13% (p_), and 58% to 10% (PII).", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2014-01-10", "authors": ["Keith AWear", "Paul MGammell", "SubhaMaruvada", "YunboLiu", "Gerald RHarris"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6689776"}

The mechanism was verified in various optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors and solar cells etc. The fast development and dramatic increasing interest in the piezo-phototronic field not only demonstrate the way the piezo-phototronic effects work, but also indicate the strong need for further research in the physical mechanism and potential applications. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish the contribution of the piezo-phototronic effect from other factors induced by external strain such as piezoresistance, band shifting or contact area change, which also affect the carrier behaviour and device performance. In this perspective, we review our recent progress on piezo-phototronics and especially focus on pointing out the features of piezo-phototronic effect in four aspects: I-V characteristics; c-axis orientation; influence of illumination; and modulation of carrier behaviour. Finally we proposed several criteria for describing the contribution made by the piezo-phototronic effect to the performance of optoelectronic devices.

However, it remains a major challenge to further improve their electromechanical response for advanced applications such as precision control and monitoring systems. We here investigated the incorporation of graphene platelets (GnPs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), each with various weight fractions, into PZT (lead zirconate titanate)/epoxy composites to produce three-phase nanocomposites. The nanocomposite films show markedly improved piezoelectric coefficients and electromechanical responses (50%) besides an enhancement of ~200% in stiffness. The carbon nanomaterials strengthened the impact of electric field on the PZT particles by appropriately raising the electrical conductivity of the epoxy. GnPs have been proved to be far more promising in improving the poling behavior and dynamic response than MWNTs. The superior dynamic sensitivity of GnP-reinforced composite may be caused by the GnPs' high load transfer efficiency arising from their two-dimensional geometry and good compatibility with the matrix. The reduced acoustic impedance mismatch resulting from the improved thermal conductance may also contribute to the higher sensitivity of GnP-reinforced composite.

Numerous therapeutic options are available for the treatment of the horizontally deficient ridge. With advances in tissue engineering, the use of growth factors can significantly improve wound healing with more rapid bone formation and maturation. These case reports demonstrate a technique that enhances the predictability of horizontal bone gain with reduced surgical trauma and postoperative complications. Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor BB (rhPDGF-BB) in combination with particulate allograft is used to stimulate the proliferation and migration of osteogenic cells. A ridge split technique with vertical bone incisions allows expansion and mobilization of the buccal plate, creating a space that will contain the particulate graft material. Decortication of the mobilized buccal plate will create pathways to allow cellular and vascular access for enhanced maturation. Additional graft material is placed lateral to the mobilized buccal plate to increase apical ridge width. The use of piezoelectric surgery enables a precise crestal bony incision in severely deficient ridge widths and aids in faster wound healing.

We call these \"Gel-SLIPS\" because the porous PVDF-HFP film fabricated using the NIPS process has been used as a gel electrolyte in a lithium-ion battery. In previous reports, SLIPS fabrication required complex processes, high annealing temperatures, and drying. Gel-SLIPS can be fabricated from the adjusted solution and the lubricant at room temperature and pressure in 5 min by squeegee, cast, or dip methods. NIPS is based on a quick phase separation process in situ, and reduction of the surface energy is not required because of the considerable fluorine in PVDF-HFP. Moreover, because of the flexible nanonetwork structure of PVDF-HFP, Gel-SLIPS exhibited self-standability and high transmittance (>87% at 600 nm).

For recent 30 years, multi-glycoside of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (GTW), an extract from Chinese herbal medicine has been proved clinically effective in improving GS in CKD in China. However, therapeutic mechanisms involved in vivo are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to explain the dose-effects and molecular mechanisms of GTW on GS by regulating TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling activity in adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy (ADRN).\nRats with ADRN, created by unilateral nephrectomy and twice adriamycin injections (ADR, 4 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) within 4 weeks, were divided into four groups, the Sham group, the Vehicle group, the low-dose GTW-treated group, and the high-dose GTW-treated group, and that, sacrificed at the end of the 6th week after administration. Proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, glomerulosclerotic morphological makers, podocyte shape, and nephrin expression were examined, respectively. Protein expressions of key signaling molecules in TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway, such as TGF-\u03b21, Smad3, phosphorylated-Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3), and Smad7, were also evaluated individually.\nThe results indicated that the characterizations of ADRN involved the typical prolonged GS, a small amount of abnormal proteinuria, and the failing renal function; TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling molecules, especially Smad3, p-Smad2/3, and Smad7 were activated in vivo, accompanied by the exasperation of glomerulosclerotic lesion; GTW at high-dose (100 mg/kg) and low-dose (50 mg/kg) could slightly ameliorate the prolonged GS and nephrin expression, furthermore, the anti-proliferative action of GTW at high-dose was superior to that at low-dose, but caused the significant liver injury; in ADRN model rats, protein expressions of TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad2/3, and Smad7 in the kidneys could be regulated with the treatment of GTW at low-dose.\nThis study farther demonstrated that the low-dose of GTW, as a natural regulator in vivo, could effectively and safely ameliorate the prolonged GS in FSGS model, via the potential molecular mechanisms involving the reduction of ECM components and the suppression of TGF-\u03b21 over-expression, as well as the bidirectional regulation of TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling activity.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2013-12-24", "authors": ["Yi-GangWan", "Xiao-YanChe", "WeiSun", "Yan-RuHuang", "Xian-JieMeng", "Hao-LiChen", "Xi-MiaoShi", "YueTu", "WeiWu", "Ying-LuLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.005"}

Its harmonic and transient responses are simulated and inspected. A prototype based on the model is fabricated and used to conduct experiments.

We observed that RGC and glia can be successfully printed using a piezoelectric printer. Whilst inkjet printing reduced the cell population due to sedimentation within the printing system, imaging of the printhead nozzle, which is the area where the cells experience the greatest shear stress and rate, confirmed that there was no evidence of destruction or even significant distortion of the cells during jet ejection and drop formation. Importantly, the viability of the cells was not affected by the printing process. When we cultured the same number of printed and non-printed RGC/glial cells, there was no significant difference in cell survival and RGC neurite outgrowth. In addition, use of a glial substrate significantly increased RGC neurite outgrowth, and this effect was retained when the cells had been printed. In conclusion, printing of RGC and glia using a piezoelectric printhead does not adversely affect viability and survival/growth of the cells in culture.

IR and XPS data proved that the process is more efficient when the radiofrequency plasma pretreatment was performed using N2 and N2/H2 as discharge gases. NIR-CI, AFM and XPS surface evaluation revealed that immobilization of IgG onto N2/H2 plasma-treated PVDF via grafted protein-A was achieved with an ends-on orientation, leaving available the antigen binding sites of IgG. This procedure could be a promising route for the preparation of oriented IgG assembly onto PVDF, useful in biomedical, membranes or sensors applications.

To this end we have identified three noncontiguous segments of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) \u03b1-subunit that contribute to the conformationally sensitive immunological hotspot on the AChR termed the main immunogenic region (MIR): \u03b1(1-12), \u03b1(65-79), and \u03b1(110-115).

Probing the Torpedo AChR \u03b1-subunit with mAb 132A, a disease inducing anti-MIR mAb raised against the Torpedo AChR, we have determined that two of the three MIR segments, \u03b1(1-12) and \u03b1(65-79), form a complex providing the signature components recognized by mAb 132A. These two segments straddle a third, \u03b1(110-115), that seems not to contribute specific side chains for 132A recognition, but is necessary for optimum antibody binding.

Nano Ag particles with a size less than 20 nm were discretely grown on the surface of the 100 nm BaTiO3. The similar lattice spacing of the (1 1 1) planes of BT and Ag led to the hetero-epitaxial growth of Ag on the BT surface. The thickness of the coherent interface was about 3 nm. The adhesion of Ag to BT efficiently prevented the continuous contact between Ag particles in the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix and suppressed the formation of the conducting path in the composite.

{"title": "Investigation of PAA/PVDF-NZVI hybrids for metronidazole removal: synthesis, characterization, and reactivity characteristics.", "abstract": "For the first time, the removal process of metronidazole (MNZ) from aqueous solutions over nano zerovalent iron (NZVI) encapsulated within poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes was reported. The resultant composite (PPN) demonstrated high reactivity, excellent stability and reusability over the reaction course. Such excellent performance might be attributed to the presence of the charged carboxyl groups in PVDF membrane support, which could enhance NZVI dispersion and improve its longevity. Results showed that a lower initial concentration and higher reaction temperature facilitated the removal of MNZ by PPN, and that the acidic and neutral conditions generally exhibited more favorable effect on MNZ removal than the alkaline ones. Kinetics of the MNZ removal by PPN was found to follow a two-parameter pseudo-first-order decay model well, and the activation energy of the MNZ degradation by PPN was determined to be 30.49kJ/mol. The presence of chloride ions slightly enhanced the reactivity of PPN with MNZ, whereas sulfate ions inhibited its reactivity. In addition, MNZ degradation pathways by PPN were proposed based on the identified intermediates. This study suggests that PPN composite possessing excellent performance may be a promising functional material to pretreat antibiotic wastewaters.", "journal": "Journal of hazardous materials", "date": "2013-12-10", "authors": ["JiachengYang", "XiangyuWang", "MinpingZhu", "HuilingLiu", "JunMa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.11.037"}

This emulsification process dispersed oil droplets in water without any emulsifier. Emulsions were prepared with different vegetable oil ratios 5%, 10% and 15% (v/v) using high frequency ultrasounds generated by piezoelectric ceramic transducer vibrating at 1.7 MHz. The emulsion was prepared with various emulsification times between 0 and 10h. Oil droplets size was measured by laser granulometry. The pH variation was monitored; electrophoretic mobility and conductivity variation were measured using Z\u00eatasizer equipment during emulsification process. The results revealed that oil droplets average size decreased significantly (p<0.05) during the first 6h of emulsification process and that from 160 to 1 \u03bcm for emulsions with 5%, 10% and from 400 to 29 \u03bcm for emulsion with 15% of initial oil ratio. For all tested oil ratios, pH measurement showed significant decrease and negative electrophoretic mobility showed the accumulation of OH(-) at oil/water interface leading to droplets stability in the emulsion. The conductivity of emulsions showed a decrease of the ions quantity in solution, which indicated formation of positive charge layer around OH(-) structure. They constitute a double ionic layer around oil particles providing emulsion stability.

Moreover situations occur wherein implementation of external physical sensor is impossible, here self-sensing lends its hand appropriately. Though self-sensing actuation (SSA) is extensively studied in piezoelectric, exploring this property in shape memory alloy is still under study. A simple scheme is developed which allows differential resistance measurement of antagonistic shape memory alloy actuated wires to concurrently sense and actuate in a closed loop system. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is experimentally verified by designing a one link manipulator arm and is performed in a real time tracking control. In a practical implementation of the self-sensing actuator a newly proposed signal processing electronic circuit is used for direct differential resistance feedback control upto a bandwidth of 1.8 Hz. The control design uses fuzzy PID which requires no detailed information about the constitutive model of SMA.

Understanding the underlying physics and quantifying the electromechanical properties of these structures, the topic of this research study, play a major role in designing next-generation nanoelectromechanical devices. Here, atomistic simulations are utilized to study surface and size-scale effects on the electromechanical response of 1D ZnO nanostructures. It is shown that the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of these structures are controlled by their size, cross-sectional geometry, and loading configuration. The study reveals enhancement of the piezoelectric and elastic modulus of ZnO nanowires (NW) with diameter d > 1 nm, followed by a sudden drop for d < 1 nm due to transformation of NWs to nanotubes (NTs). Degradation of mechanical and piezoelectric properties of ZnO nanobelts (NBs) followed by an enhancement in piezoelectric properties occurs when their lower dimension is reduced to <1 nm. The latter enhancement can be explained in the context of surface reconfiguration and formation of hexagon-tetragon (HT) pairs at the intersection of (21[combining macron]1[combining macron]0) and (011[combining macron]0) planes in NBs. Transition from a surface-reconstructed dominant to a surface-relaxed dominant region is demonstrated for lateral dimensions <1 nm.

{"title": "AMPK activation regulates neuronal structure in developing hippocampal neurons.", "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a cellular and whole organism energy sensor to regulate ATP-consuming (anabolic) and ATP-generating (catabolic) pathways. The heterotrimeric AMPK complex consists of a catalytic \u03b1-subunit, regulatory \u03b2-subunit, and an AMP/ATP-binding \u03b3-subunit. Several alternate isoforms exist for each subunit (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b31, \u03b32 and \u03b33). However, little is known of the expression pattern or function of the individual catalytic complexes in regulating neuronal structure. In this study, we examined the role of AMPK subunits in differentiating hippocampal neurons. We found that during development, the expression of AMPK subunits increase and that activation of AMPK by energetic stress inhibits neuronal development at multiple stages, not only during axon outgrowth, but also during dendrite growth and arborization. The presence of a single functional AMPK catalytic complex was sufficient to mediate these inhibitory effects of energetic stress. Activation of AMPK mediates these effects by suppressing both the mTOR and Akt signaling pathways. These findings demonstrate that the energy-sensing AMPK pathway regulates neuronal structure in distinct regions of developing neurons at multiple stages of development.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2013-12-04", "authors": ["SRamamurthy", "EChang", "YCao", "JZhu", "G VRonnett"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.11.048"}

Here, we propose a method to adsorb urinary proteins onto a membrane we named Urimem. This simple and inexpensive method requires minimal sample handling, uses no organic solvents, and is environmentally friendly. Urine samples were filtered through the membrane, and urinary proteins were adsorbed onto the membrane. The proteins on the membrane were dried and stored in a vacuum bag, which keeps the protein pattern faithfully preserved. The membrane may even permit storage at room temperature for weeks. Using this simple and inexpensive method, it is possible to begin preserving urine samples from all consenting people.

Successful execution of bone sawing requires a high level of dexterity and experience. A virtual reality (VR) surgical simulator can provide a safe, cost-effective, and repeatable training method. In this study, we developed a VR training simulator with haptic functions to simulate bone-sawing force, which was generated by the experimental force model. Ten human skulls were obtained in this study for the determination of surgical bone-sawing force. Using a 5-DOF machining center and a micro-reciprocating saw, bone specimens with different bone density were sawed at different feed rates (20, 40, and 60\u2009mm/min) and spindle speeds (9800, 11,200 and 12,600 cycles per minute). The sawing forces were recorded with a piezoelectric dynamometer and a signal acquisition system. Linear correlation analysis of all experimental data indicates that there were significant positive linear correlations between bone-sawing force and bone density and tool feed rate and a moderate negative linear correlation with tool spindle rate. By performing multiple regression analysis, the prediction models for the bone-sawing procedure were determined. By employing Omega.6 as a haptic device, a medical simulator for the Lefort I osteotomy was developed based on an experimental force model.

The present study was designed to investigate the anti-diabetic, anti-AD, and anti-inflammatory potential of apigenin and its two C-glycosylated derivatives, vitexin and isovitexin by in vitro assays including rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant aldose reductase (HRAR), advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), \u03b2-site amyloid precursor (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Among them, isovitexin was found as the most potent inhibitor against RLAR, HRAR, AGE, AChE, and BChE while vitexin showed the most potent PTP1B inhibitory activity. Despite the relatively weak anti-diabetic and anti-AD potentials, apigenin showed powerful antiinflammatory activity by inhibiting NO production and iNOS and COX-2 expression while vitexin and isovitexin were inactive.

Based on the above outcomes, an EMAT is developed to measure the bolt axial stress without loosening the bolt, which is required in the conventional EMAT test method. The experimental results from the measurement of the bolt tension show that the shear and the mode-converted longitudinal waves can be received successfully, and the ratio of the times of flight of the shear and the mode-converted longitudinal waves is linearly proportional to the bolt axial tension.

Aliquots were taken at 3, 6, 9, 24 and 48 h and immediately frozen at -80\u00b0C. PON1 activities were measured, as well as PON1 and apolipoprotein distributions in HDL subclasses by gradient gel electrophoresis.\nThe first novel finding in our study is the evidence provided for a significant activation of both lactonase and arylesterase activities of PON1 that ensues in a very short time frame of incubation of serum ex vivo at 37\u00b0C. All subjects studied displayed these changes, the activation was apparent in <3h, peaked at 6h and amounted to >20%. This is associated with a temperature and time-dependent redistribution of PON1 activity in HDL subclasses, with an increase in activity in both very large HDL2 and small HDL3 in the first phase (3-9h), followed by a progressive transfer of PON1 to very large HDL2 as the particles mature. These changes are paralleled by the appearance of weak, but apparent PON1 activity at subspecies that correspond to sdLDL. During the first phase of PON1 activation and shifts, a parallel shift of apoE can be evidenced: at 3-9h, apoE increases in sdLDL, after that time it is lost from HDL and also from sdLDL and stays in VLDL at the origin of the run. ApoA-I shifts towards larger particles, which parallels the change in PON1. As HDL matures there is a progressive shift of apoA-II towards larger HDL. Low levels of apoA-IV at the initiation of the incubation are followed by time dependent quick disappearance of apoA-IV in HDL which parallels the changes in PON1, apoE and A-II.\nShort, ex vivo incubation of serum leads to quick activation of PON1 associated with transfers to HDL3c, large HDL and sdLDL. The process is blocked by CETP and LCAT inhibitors. The data suggest that HDL maturation optimizes PON1 activity. These findings may be of interest for future studies aimed at modulating PON-1 activity for its cardioprotective effects and suggest a new mechanism whereby CETP inhibitors failed in clinical trials.", "journal": "Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["AlejandroGugliucci"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2013.11.021"}

The technique showed to be very powerful and sensitive to most of the changes described in the literature, which have been elucidated by some other techniques. The value for the temperature of gelatinization found using the sensor was confirmed by the analysis of the same starch emulsion by polarized light microscopy. Temperatures of gelatinization were found to vary with the sample heating rate, as follows: 73.5 \u00b0C at 2.0 \u00b0C/min, 66.0 \u00b0C at 1.0 \u00b0C/min, and 65.0 \u00b0C at 0.5 \u00b0C/min. Hysteresis of the studied system was evidenced by the frequency shift before heating and after cooling till the initial temperature.

{"title": "Development and validation of a novel leaky surface acoustic wave immunosensor array for label-free and high-sensitive detection of cyclosporin A in whole-blood samples.", "abstract": "This manuscript described a novel 2\u00d73 model of leaky surface acoustic wave (LSAW) immunosensor array for label-free and high-sensitive detection of Cyclosporin A (CsA) in whole-blood samples. In this technique, every resonator crystal unit of the LSAW immunosensor array had an individual oscillator circuit to work without mutual interference. The LSAW immunosensor was first immobilized with protein A from Staphylococcus aureus and monoclonal anti-CsA antibody on the gold electrode surface of 100 MHz LiTaO3 piezoelectric crystals, which then captured the CsA. The CsA increased the mass loading of LSAW immunosensor and leaded to phase shifts of LSAW. Consequently, under optimal conditions, the designed LSAW immunosensor exhibited a detection limit of 0.89 ng/mL, quantification limit of 2.96 ng/mL, and wide dynamic linear range from 1 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL for CsA detection. Application of the LSAW immunosensor array to clinical sample revealed that consistency and comparability between LSAW immunosensor and the enzyme multiplied immunoassay method were good. Moreover, the immunosensor could be regenerated for ten times without appreciable loss of activity. Therefore, the self-designed LSAW immunosensor array provided a rapid, accurate, label-free, easy handling, and dynamic real-time method for the detection of immunosuppressive drugs in clinical laboratory.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["KaiChang", "FengWang", "YiDing", "FengPan", "FakeLi", "ShuangrongJia", "WeipingLu", "ShaoliDeng", "JianfengShi", "MingChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.066"}

Mutations in CLN5 cause a variant late-infantile human disease and some cases of juvenile and adult clinical disease. NCLs also occur in animals, and a flock of New Zealand Borderdale sheep with a CLN5 splice-site mutation has been developed for model studies. Dissociated mixed neural cells from CLN5-deficient foetal sheep brains contained no obvious storage bodies at plating but these accumulated rapidly in culture, mainly in microglial cells and also in neurons and astrocytes. Accumulation was very obvious after a week, as monitored by fluorescent microscopy and immunostaining for subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase. Photography at intervals revealed the dynamic nature of the cultures and a flow of storage bodies between cells, specifically the phagocytosis of storage-body containing cells by microglia and incorporation of the storage bodies into the host cells. No storage was observed in cultured control cells. Transduction of cell cultures with a lentiviral vector expressing a C-terminal Myc tagged CLN5 resulted in secretion of post-translationally glycosylated and processed CLN5. Transduction of CLN5-deficient cultures with this construct rapidly reversed storage body accumulation, to less than half in only six days. These results show that storage body accumulation is reversible with enzyme correction and support the use of these cultures for testing of therapeutics prior to whole animal studies.", "journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["Stephanie MHughes", "Katie MHope", "Janet BoyuXu", "Nadia LMitchell", "David NPalmer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2013.11.011"}

Identifying and understanding the hemorrhagic components of its venom is therefore particularly important in optimizing medical treatment of patients. We describe a novel high molecular mass hemorrhagin, VaH4. The isolated molecule is a covalent dimer of two homologous subunits, VaH4-A and VaH4-B. Complete structural characterization of A and partial characterization of B revealed that both belong to the P-III class of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), comprising a metalloproteinase, a disintegrin-like domain and a cysteine-rich domain. However, neither VaH4-A nor VaH4-B possess the Cys174 involved in the inter-subunit disulphide bond of P-III SVMPs. A three-dimensional model of the VaH4 dimer suggests that Cys132 serves this function. This implies that dimers in the P-III class of SVMPs can be formed either between their Cys132 or Cys174 residues. The proteolytic activity and stability of VaH4 depend on Zn\u00b2\u207a and Ca\u00b2\u207a ions and the presence of glycosaminoglycans, which indicates physiological interaction of VaH4 with the latter element of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular mass of VaH4, determined by MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry, is 110.2 kDa. N-deglycosylation reduced the mass of each monomer by 8.7 kDa. The two possible N-glycosylation sites in VaH4-A are located at completely different positions from those in homodimeric P-IIIc VaH3 from the same venom, however, without any evident functional implications. The hemorrhagic activity of this slightly acidic SVMP is ascribed to its hydrolysis of components of the ECM, particularly fibronectin and nidogen, and of some blood coagulation proteins, in particular the \u03b1-chain of fibrinogen. VaH4 is also significant medically as we found it cytotoxic against cancer cells and due to its substantial sequence similarity to ADAM/ADAMTS family of physiologically very important human proteins of therapeutic potential.", "journal": "Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["AdrijanaLeonardi", "TamaraSajevic", "LidijaKova\u010di\u010d", "Jo\u017eePunger\u010dar", "MajaLang Balija", "BeataHalassy", "AlenkaTrampu\u0161 Bakija", "IgorKri\u017eaj"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.009"}
{"title": "Assessing the relationship between the inter-rod coupling and the efficiency of piezocomposite high-intensity focused ultrasound transducers.", "abstract": "The electroacoustic conversion efficiency of the ultrasonic transducer is a critical performance index for high-power applications. The material properties, volume fraction (VF) and aspect ratio (AR) are typically regarded as the design parameters of the piezocomposite transducer. We hypothesized that the spacing between piezoelectric rods was also a dominant factor. Therefore, the inter-rod coupling effects on the efficiency of 1-3 piezocomposite ultrasonic transducers were investigated in this study. The efficiencies of six flat and three curved 1.0 MHz PZT4 epoxy composite transducers with different geometric parameters were measured. Finite element transient analyses of the inter-rod electrical-mechanical coupling in the composites were carried out to explain the measured results. The experimental results showed that for 0.47 AR, the 79% VF transducers had lower efficiency than the 64% VF and 53% VF transducers. For 0.19 AR, the efficiency of the 59% VF transducer was not greater than the efficiency of the 39% VF transducer. Numerical analyses demonstrated that the positive peak voltage induced by the coupling of the side rods was more than twice the level induced by the coupling of the diagonal rods for any spacing. The diagonal coupling voltage peak did not change for spacings larger than 0.2 mm. Moreover, for spacings of 0.05 and 0.1 mm, the inter-rod coupling caused 24% and 20% waveform shifts of the driving voltage, respectively, while the 0.2 mm spacing coupling caused a 14% reduction in the amplitude of the driving voltage. As a result, the asymmetry of the driving voltage degraded the efficiency of the composite transducers and became more severe when the spacing was decreased. We concluded that the efficiency loss induced by inter-rod coupling as a function of spacing should be considered when designing piezocomposite transducers.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["Gin-ShinChen", "Chia-ChingPan", "Yu-LiLin", "Jung-SungCheng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.10.003"}

{"title": "Selective vulnerability of hippocampal sub-fields to oxygen-glucose deprivation is a function of animal age.", "abstract": "For more than a century, the hippocampal sub-fields have been recognized as being differentially vulnerable to injury. While the cause remains unknown, the explanations generally considered have involved either vascular differences, or innate variability among cells. To examine the latter possibility, we prepared acute hippocampal slices from Sprague-Dawley rats, applied a brief period of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD; an in vitro model of ischemia), and assessed the viability of dissected sub-fields (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus) by measuring mitochondrial 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) metabolism. In slices from young animals (15 weeks of age), post-OGD TTC metabolism was significantly reduced in the CA sub-fields relative to the dentate gyrus. Since previous studies found increasing age may worsen ischemic injury, we completed the same experiment using tissue from animals at 52 weeks of age, and found no differences in TTC metabolism across sub-fields. Given the established role of glutamate receptors in ischemic cell death, we examined two key subunit proteins (GluN1, found in all NMDA receptors, and GluA2, found in most AMPA receptors) across sub-fields and age to determine whether their expression complemented our viability data. We found that, relative to the CA1, the DG displayed greater GluN1 expression and lower GluA2 expression in both young and old animals.

We investigated the molecular mechanism of axonal guidance growth under piezoelectric ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) stimulation in the primary cultured cortical neurons.

Moreover, PZT activated the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by increasing the frequency and amplitude of EPSCs of the cortical neurons in patch clamp assay.

{"title": "Control of soft machines using actuators operated by a Braille display.", "abstract": "One strategy for actuating soft machines (e.g., tentacles, grippers, and simple walkers) uses pneumatic inflation of networks of small channels in an elastomeric material. Although the management of a few pneumatic inputs and valves to control pressurized gas is straightforward, the fabrication and operation of manifolds containing many (>50) independent valves is an unsolved problem. Complex pneumatic manifolds-often built for a single purpose-are not easily reconfigured to accommodate the specific inputs (i.e., multiplexing of many fluids, ranges of pressures, and changes in flow rates) required by pneumatic systems. This paper describes a pneumatic manifold comprising a computer-controlled Braille display and a micropneumatic device. The Braille display provides a compact array of 64 piezoelectric actuators that actively close and open elastomeric valves of a micropneumatic device to route pressurized gas within the manifold. The positioning and geometries of the valves and channels in the micropneumatic device dictate the functionality of the pneumatic manifold, and the use of multi-layer soft lithography permits the fabrication of networks in a wide range of configurations with many possible functions. Simply exchanging micropneumatic devices of different designs enables rapid reconfiguration of the pneumatic manifold.

{"title": "Polyvinylidene fluoride/siloxane nanofibrous membranes for long-term continuous CO2 -capture with large absorption-flux enhancement.", "abstract": "In a CO2 membrane contactor system, CO2 passes through a hydrophobic porous membrane in the gas phase to contact the amine absorbent in the liquid phase. Consequently, additional CO2 gas is absorbed by amine absorbents. This study examines highly porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/siloxane nanofibrous layers that are modified with hydrophobic fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) functional groups and successfully coated onto a macroporous Al2 O3 membrane. The performance of these materials in a membrane contactor system for CO2 absorption is also investigated. Compared with pristine PVDF nanofibrous membranes, the PVDF/siloxane nanofibrous membranes exhibit greater solvent resistance and mechanical strength, making them more suitable for use in CO2 capture by the membrane contactor. The PVDF/siloxane nanofibrous layer in highly porous FAS-modified membranes can prevent the wetting of the membrane by the amine absorbent; this extends the periods of continuous CO2 absorption and results in a high CO2 absorption flux with a minimum of 500 % enhancement over that of the uncoated membranes. This study suggests the potential use of an FAS-modified PVDF/siloxane nanofibrous membrane in a membrane contactor system for CO2 absorption. The resulting hydrophobic membrane contactor also demonstrates the potential for large-scale CO2 absorption during post-combustion processes in power plants.", "journal": "ChemSusChem", "date": "2013-11-07", "authors": ["Yi-FengLin", "Chi-SenWang", "Chia-ChiehKo", "Chien-HuaChen", "Kai-ShiunChang", "Kuo-LunTung", "Kueir-RarnLee"], "doi": "10.1002/cssc.201300578"}

Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT) is a well-known lead-free piezoelectric material; however, it is often reported to possess high leakage conductivity that is problematic for its piezo- and ferroelectric applications. Here we report this high leakage to be oxide ion conduction due to Bi-deficiency and oxygen vacancies induced during materials processing.

ERG9 gene that encodes for SS was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into pPICZB expression vector. The recombinant construct was then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 host strain. Expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-His tag probe. Optimal protein production was achieved by cultivating the culture with 1.0% methanol for 72h. The recombinant protein was purified to approximately 97% pure in a single step immobilized metal affinity chromatography with a yield of 70.3%. Besides, the purified protein exhibited specific reactivity with immune sera on Western blot.

{"title": "Time and frequency dependent rheology of reactive silica gels.", "abstract": "In a mixture of sodium silicate and low concentrated sulfuric acid, nano-sized silica particles grow and may aggregate to a system spanning gel network. We studied the influence of the finite solubility of silica at high pH on the mechanical properties of the gel with classical and piezo-rheometers. Direct preparation of the gel sample in the rheometer cell avoided any pre-shear of the gel structure during the filling of the rheometer. The storage modulus of the gel grew logarithmically with time with two distinct growth laws. The system passes the gel point very quickly but still shows relaxation at low frequency, typically below 6 rad/s. We attribute this as a sign of structural rearrangements due to the finite solubility of silica at high pH. The reaction equilibrium between bond formation and dissolution maintains a relatively large bond dissolution rate, which leads to a finite life time of the bonds and behavior similar to physical gels. This interpretation is also compatible with the logarithmic time dependence of the storage modulus. The frequency dependence was more pronounced for lower water concentrations, higher temperatures and shorter reaction times. With two relaxation models (the modified Cole-Cole model and the empirical Baumgaertel-Schausberger-Winter model) we deduced characteristic times from the experimental data. Both models approximately described the data and resulted in similar relaxation times.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2013-11-05", "authors": ["MiaoWang", "H HenningWinter", "G\u00fcnter KAuernhammer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2013.09.035"}

The chemical structure of FA-PEG-COL conjugate was characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS, FT-IR and (1)H NMR. The average size of siRNA/FA-PEG-COL nanoparticles was approximately 200 nm, and the surface charge was +8.4 mV compared to +30.5 mV with siRNA/COL nanoparticles. FA-PEG-COL nanoparticles demonstrated superior compatibility with erythrocytes in terms of degree of aggregation and haemolytic activity and also effects on cell viability was lower when compared with COL nanoparticles. FA grafting significantly facilitated the uptake of nanoparticles via receptor mediated endocytosis as demonstrated by flow cytometry. The in vitro transfection and gene knockdown efficiency of HIF-1\u03b1 were superior to COL nanoparticles (76-62%, respectively) and was comparable to Lipofectamine 2000 (79%) as demonstrated by RT-qPCR and Western blot.

The modeling technique was validated experimentally, and the results showed satisfactory consistency in between, both revealing: the developed modeling approach is able to faithfully simulate fatigue crack-incurred nonlinearities manifested in ultrasonic waves; a cumulative growth of the acoustic nonlinearity parameter with increasing wave propagation distance exists; such a parameter acquired via a sensing path is nonlinearly related to the offset distance from the fatigue crack to that sensing path; and neither the incidence angle of the probing wave nor the length of the sensing path impacts on the parameter significantly.

{"title": "Optoacoustic monitoring of cutting efficiency and thermal damage during laser ablation.", "abstract": "Successful laser surgery is characterized by a precise cut and effective hemostasis with minimal collateral thermal damage to the adjacent tissues. Consequently, the surgeon needs to control several parameters, such as power, pulse repetition rate, and velocity of movements. In this study we propose utilizing optoacoustics for providing the necessary real-time feedback of cutting efficiency and collateral thermal damage. Laser ablation was performed on a bovine meat slab using a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser (532 nm, 4 kHz, 18 W). Due to the short pulse duration of 7.6 ns, the same laser has also been used for generation of optoacoustic signals. Both the shockwaves, generated due to tissue removal, as well as the normal optoacoustic responses from the surrounding tissue were detected using a single broadband piezoelectric transducer. It has been observed that the rapid reduction in the shockwave amplitude occurs as more material is being removed, indicating decrease in cutting efficiency, whereas gradual decrease in the optoacoustic signal likely corresponds to coagulation around the ablation crater. Further heating of the surrounding tissue leads to carbonization accompanied by a significant shift in the optoacoustic spectra. Our results hold promise for real-time monitoring of cutting efficiency and collateral thermal damage during laser surgery. In practice, this could eventually facilitate development of automatic cut-off mechanisms that will guarantee an optimal tradeoff between cutting and heating while avoiding severe thermal damage to the surrounding tissues.", "journal": "Lasers in medical science", "date": "2013-10-23", "authors": ["ErwinBay", "AlexandreDouplik", "DanielRazansky"], "doi": "10.1007/s10103-013-1434-y"}

Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding cytoplasmic hemoprotein that is abundantly expressed in oxidative skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Numerous studies have implicated that hypoxia regulates myoglobin expression to allow adaptation to conditions of hypoxic stress. Few studies have yet looked at the effect of myoglobin on the adaptation to severe environmental stress on TA. To investigate how the Tibetan antelope (TA) has adapted to a high altitude environment at the molecular level, we cloned and analyzed the myoglobin gene from TA, compared the expression of myoglobin mRNA and protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle between TA and low altitude sheep. The results indicated that the full-length myoglobin cDNA is composed of 1154 bp with a 111 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 578 bp 3' UTR and a 465 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 17.05 kD. The TA myoglobin cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were highly homologous with that of other species. When comparing the myoglobin sequence from TA with the Ovis aries myoglobin sequence, variations were observed at codons 21 (GGT\u2192GAT) and 78 (GAA\u2192AAG), and these variations lead to changes in the corresponding amino acids, i.e., Gly\u2192Asp and Glu\u2192Lys, respectively. But these amino acid substitutions are unlikely to effect the ability of binding oxygen because their location is less important, which is revealed by the secondary structure and 3D structure of TA myoglobin elaborated by homology modeling. However, the results of myoglobin expression in cardiac and skeletal muscles showed that they were both significantly higher than that in plain sheep not only in mRNA but also protein level. We speculated that the higher expression of myoglobin in TA cardiac and skeletal muscles improves their ability to obtain and store oxygen under hypoxic conditions.

{"title": "Fabrication of piezoelectric components for a tunable and efficient device for DNA delivery into mammalian cells.", "abstract": "We fabricated three piezoelectric components (PZT) that can produce ultrasonic waves with various generated power in order to improve the delivery of DNA molecule and polymer/DNA complexes into cells. Two cationic polymers (PEI and PDMAEMA) were interacted with DNA to form nano-scaled DNA/polymer complexes with/without the help of PZT devices. The application of PZT devices under optimal conditions helped to avoid cytotoxicity and greatly increased the transfection (DNA delivery) efficiency of these complexes in mammalian cells. The cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency were found to be correlated with the PZT-generated power, waveforms and duration of ultrasonic treatment. There was no observable cytotoxicity in our experimental models and, a maximum transfection efficiency 700% greater than that of polymer/DNA complexes without applying ultrasound was achieved. The transfection efficiency of plain polymer/DNA complexes (without PZT treatment) corresponded to a 630-fold increase in comparison to the naked DNA. The waveforms of generated ultrasound greatly influenced the transfection efficiency, while cytotoxicity was not significantly affected.

In addition, the generated waves from PZT do not cause dissociation of polymer/DNA complexes or a change in the particle sizes of these complexes.

{"title": "Caveolin-1 promotes gastric cancer progression by up-regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition by crosstalk of signalling mechanisms under hypoxic condition.", "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the second most fatal common form of cancer. The crosstalk among signalling pathways that results in the acceleration of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a pivotal role in the molecular mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis. To understand the role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the expression pattern was studied in human gastric adenocarcinoma tissues and also in AGS and KATO III cell lines. Here, we show that during hypoxic condition, the increase in the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) results in a significant decrease in the expression of caveolin-1 which is regulated by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). The reduced levels of Cav-1 correlated with the increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation resulting in the significant activation of its downstream target STAT3. Accumulation of pSTAT3 in the nucleus results in the decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of mesenchymal markers (Slug, \u03b1-SMA, N-cadherin and vimentin). Crosstalk of EGFR and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signalling with Wnt signalling enhances cell proliferation, cell survival and upregulates EMT. There was no significant alteration in the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal molecules in both the cell lines studied. Thus, we provide evidence that Cav-1 was modulated by HSP90 and functions as a crucial regulator of EMT in gastric cancer.", "journal": "European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)", "date": "2013-09-28", "authors": ["AnbarasuKannan", "ArunkumarKrishnan", "MohammedAli", "ShyamaSubramaniam", "DevarajHalagowder", "Niranjali DevarajSivasithamparam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejca.2013.08.016"}

Rguiti, Reducing crosstalk in array structures by controlling the excitation voltage of individual elements: a feasibility study, Ultrasonics, 53 (6) (2013) 1135-1140] from the harmonic regime to the transient one. For this purpose a part of an ultrasonic transducer array radiating in water is modeled around the frequency 0.5 MHz using the finite element method. The study is carried out at low frequency in order to respect the same operating conditions than the previous paper. This choice facilitated the fabrication of the transducer arrays and the comparison of the numerical results with the experimental ones. The modeled array is composed of seventeen elements with the central element excited, while the others are grounded. The matching layers and the backing are not taken into account which limits the crosstalk only to the piezoelectric elements and fluid. This consideration reduces the structure density mesh and results in faster computation time (about 25 min for each configuration using a computer with a processor Intel Core i5-3210M, frequency 2.5 GHz and having 4 Go memory (RAM)). The novelty of this research work is to prove the efficiency of the crosstalk correction method in large frequency band as it is the case in medical imaging. The numerical results show the validity of the approach and demonstrate that crosstalk can be reduced by at least 13 dB in terms of displacement. Consequently, the directivity pattern of the individual element can be improved.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["ABybi", "SGrondel", "JAssaad", "A-CHladky-Hennion"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.09.007"}

The peptides were selected in order to have a large variability in physicochemical characteristics (including length). In virtual screening a rapid and cost-effective computational methodology for predicting binding scores of small peptide receptors vs. volatile compounds is proposed. Flexibility was considered for both ligands and peptides and each peptide conformer was treated as a possible receptor, generating a dedicated box and then running a docking process vs. all possible conformers of the 14 volatile compounds. The 5 peptides were covalently bound to gold nanoparticles and deposited onto 20 MHz quartz crystal microbalances to realize gas sensors. Gas sensing confirmed that each of the peptide conferred to the gold nanoparticles a particular selectivity pattern able to discriminate the 14 volatile compounds. The largest response was obtained for the pentapeptides Cys-Ile-His-Asn-Pro and Cys-Ile-Gln-Pro-Val while low response was achieved for the dipeptide. The comparative study, carried using a two-tailed T test, demonstrated that virtual screening was able to predict reliably the sensing ability of the pentapeptides.

We present a blood-based CRIM assay that can yield results within 48 to 72 h.

{"title": "Microfabrication of stacks of acoustic matching layers for 15 MHz ultrasonic transducers.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method used to manufacture stacks of multiple matching layers for 15 MHz piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, using fabrication technology derived from the MEMS industry. The acoustic matching layers were made on a silicon wafer substrate using micromachining techniques, i.e., lithography and etch, to design silicon and polymer layers with the desired acoustic properties. Two matching layer configurations were tested: a double layer structure consisting of a silicon-polymer composite and polymer and a triple layer structure consisting of silicon, composite, and polymer. The composite is a biphase material of silicon and polymer in 2-2 connectivity. The matching layers were manufactured by anisotropic wet etch of a (110)-oriented Silicon-on-Insulator wafer. The wafer was etched by KOH 40 wt%, to form 83 \u03bcm deep and 4.5mm long trenches that were subsequently filled with Spurr's epoxy, which has acoustic impedance 2.4 MRayl. This resulted in a stack of three layers: The silicon substrate, a silicon-polymer composite intermediate layer, and a polymer layer on the top. The stacks were bonded to PZT disks to form acoustic transducers and the acoustic performance of the fabricated transducers was tested in a pulse-echo setup, where center frequency, -6 dB relative bandwidth and insertion loss were measured. The transducer with two matching layers was measured to have a relative bandwidth of 70%, two-way insertion loss 18.4 dB and pulse length 196 ns. The transducers with three matching layers had fractional bandwidths from 90% to 93%, two-way insertion loss ranging from 18.3 to 25.4 dB, and pulse lengths 326 and 446 ns.

Firstly, acoustic pressure radiated from the transducer was measured using a hydrophone, which has a diameter of 0.2 mm. The transmission characteristics such as relative bandwidth, pulse width, and acoustic sensitivity were calculated from the experimental results. The results of the experiment showed a relative bandwidth of 50% and a pulse width of 0.061 \u03bcs. The acoustic sensitivity was 0.60 kPa/V with good linearity, where the correlation coefficient R in the fitting calculation was 0.996. A maximum pressure of 13.1 kPa was observed when the transducer was excited at a zero-to-peak voltage of 21 V. Moreover, we experimentally verified the results. The results of the pulse/echo experiment showed that the estimated diameters of the copper wires were 458 and 726 \u03bcm, where the differences between the actual and measured values were 15% and 4%, respectively. Acoustic streaming was also observed so that a particle velocity map was estimated by particle image velocimetry (PIV).

{"title": "Piezoelectric properties of aligned collagen membranes.", "abstract": "Electromechanical coupling, a phenomenon present in collagenous materials, may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Here, electromechanical coupling has been investigated via piezoresponse force microscopy in transparent and opaque membranes consisting of helical-like arrays of aligned type I collagen fibrils self-assembled from acidic solution. Using atomic force microscopy, the transparent membrane was determined to contain fibrils having an average diameter of 76 \u00b1 14 nm, whereas the opaque membrane comprised fibrils with an average diameter of 391 \u00b1 99 nm. As the acidity of the membranes must be neutralized before they can serve as cell culture substrates, the structure and piezoelectric properties of the membranes were measured under ambient conditions before and after the neutralization process. A crimp structure (1.59 \u00b1 0.37 \u00b5m in width) perpendicular to the fibril alignment became apparent in the transparent membrane when the pH was adjusted from acidic (pH = 2.5) to neutral (pH = 7) conditions. In addition, a 1.35-fold increase was observed in the amplitude of the shear piezoelectricity of the transparent membrane. The structure and piezoelectric properties of the opaque membrane were not significantly affected by the neutralization process. The results highlight the presence of an additional translational order in the transparent membrane in the direction perpendicular to the fibril alignment. The piezoelectric response of both membrane types was found to be an order of magnitude lower than that of collagen fibrils in rat tail tendon. This reduced response is attributed to less-ordered molecular assembly than is present in D-periodic collagen fibrils, as evidenced by the absence of D-periodicity in the membranes.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

These algorithms are applied to two cases: velocity profile known (CASE I) and velocity profile unknown (CASE II). The algorithms are compared with a more traditional nonlinear least squares method. Experimental tests are carried out on a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite panel instrumented with a sparse array of piezoelectric transducers to validate the proposed approaches.

Design : Retrospective review of a series of pediatric patients requiring reconstruction for skull defects. Patients/Intervention : Our series included a 2-year-old with a parietal skull tumor and resultant 3 \u00d7 3-cm defect after craniectomy, a 2-year-old with a 3 \u00d7 3-cm defect after excision of an occipital skull tumor, a 10-year-old with a 4 \u00d7 5-cm skull defect after excision of an occipital skull tumor, and a 13-year-old who suffered a gunshot to the forehead with a 12 \u00d7 7-cm frontal skull defect.

Stretch-activated ion channels represent a class of mechanosensitive proteins which allow cells to respond rapidly to changes in membrane tension; however their identity has remained elusive.

{"title": "Elastic-plastic cube model for ultrasonic friction reduction via Poisson's effect.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic friction reduction has been studied experimentally and theoretically. This paper presents a new elastic-plastic cube model which can be applied to various ultrasonic lubrication cases. A cube is used to represent all the contacting asperities of two surfaces. Friction force is considered as the product of the tangential contact stiffness and the deformation of the cube. Ultrasonic vibrations are projected onto three orthogonal directions, separately changing contact parameters and deformations. Hence, the overall change of friction forces. Experiments are conducted to examine ultrasonic friction reduction using different materials under normal loads that vary from 40 N to 240 N. Ultrasonic vibrations are generated both in longitudinal and vertical (out-of-plane) directions by way of the Poisson effect. The tests show up to 60% friction reduction; model simulations describe the trends observed experimentally.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["ShengDong", "Marcelo JDapino"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2013.05.011"}
{"title": "Bacterial mechanosensitive channels: models for studying mechanosensory transduction.", "abstract": "Sensations of touch and hearing are manifestations of mechanical contact and air pressure acting on touch receptors and hair cells of the inner ear, respectively. In bacteria, osmotic pressure exerts a significant mechanical force on their cellular membrane. Bacteria have evolved mechanosensitive (MS) channels to cope with excessive turgor pressure resulting from a hypo-osmotic shock. MS channel opening allows the expulsion of osmolytes and water, thereby restoring normal cellular turgor and preventing cell lysis.\nAs biological force-sensing systems, MS channels have been identified as the best examples of membrane proteins coupling molecular dynamics to cellular mechanics. The bacterial MS channel of large conductance (MscL) and MS channel of small conductance (MscS) have been subjected to extensive biophysical, biochemical, genetic, and structural analyses. These studies have established MscL and MscS as model systems for mechanosensory transduction.\nIn recent years, MS ion channels in mammalian cells have moved into focus of mechanotransduction research, accompanied by an increased awareness of the role they may play in the pathophysiology of diseases, including cardiac hypertrophy, muscular dystrophy, or Xerocytosis.\nA recent exciting development includes the molecular identification of Piezo proteins, which function as nonselective cation channels in mechanosensory transduction associated with senses of touch and pain. Since research on Piezo channels is very young, applying lessons learned from studies of bacterial MS channels to establishing the mechanism by which the Piezo channels are mechanically activated remains one of the future challenges toward a better understanding of the role that MS channels play in mechanobiology.", "journal": "Antioxidants & redox signaling", "date": "2013-07-10", "authors": ["BorisMartinac", "TakeshiNomura", "GammaChi", "EvgenyPetrov", "Paul RRohde", "Andrew RBattle", "AlexanderFoo", "MaryroseConstantine", "RosalbaRothnagel", "SoniaCarne", "EvelyneDeplazes", "BruceCornell", "Charles GCranfield", "BenHankamer", "Michael JLandsberg"], "doi": "10.1089/ars.2013.5471"}

Group I was euthanized at 7 days; group II, at 14; and group III, at 28 days. Each animal received four implants, two in the right and two in the left tibia (96 implants were installed). Each tibia was operated by the same technique, and there are therefore neighbor's implants installed by different techniques. Histomorphometric parameters were used: the volume occupied by trabecular bone around the implants (BV/TV), media thickness, separation and number of trabeculae around the loops, and the contact area (interface) directly between the bone and implant (BIC).\nBV/TV was similar for both techniques (P = 0.291). Reduction in trabecular thickness was observed for both techniques (P < 0.05), but then returned to prior levels, with no significant difference between techniques (P = 0.217). Trabecular number increased from day 7 to day 14 (P < 0.001) and remained constant afterward for both techniques. No difference in BIC was observed between techniques on day 28 (P = 0.961).\nPiezoelectric osteotomy allowed bone formation for osseointegration of titanium implants, was not associated with bone necrosis, and provided results similar to those of the conventional technique.

Performing a preoperative CT with a special splint, optical scanning of the models and the subsequent planning with software has enabled us to produce a model with rapid prototyping with the design of the osteotomy on which the surgical guide was shaped, the use of the guide associated with piezoelectric surgery, allowed to perform surgery under local anaesthesia, with minimal invasiveness and high accuracy.\nDentoalveolar immediate movements, with preservation of the roots of teeth involved, allow for rapid treatment of malocclusions which would be long and often difficult if not impossible to treat with orthodontics only. Dentoalveolar osteotomies associated to osteodistraction concepts, allow the orthodontist to achieve with accuracy the objectives required by the treatment plan.\nGSOS is a new method, which, utilizing 3D optical scanning images of models, software and piezoelectric surgery, allows to perform dentoalveolar movements which may be dangerous to the roots or for the periodontal support, with orthodontics only.

Recent developments reflect the concepts of nut and bolt, intrastromal implantation or an osteoodontokeratoprosthesis (OOKP). A new concept of a textile KPRO has been evaluated in a limited human study with considerable difficulties which after termination of the study and considerable improvements was restarted using animal experiments.\nThe ACTO TexKPRO is made from polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) fibers and transparent silicone. The first and second developmental stages differed in density and size of fibers and furthermore in surface modifications of the fibers and optics which were improved for the second prototype.\nImplantation of the prosthesis was performed in four patients with corneal blindness and in two cases retinal disease which required surgery. In the later animal experiments surgery was performed on three rabbits. Surgery was performed by redressing the conjunctiva, opening of the eyeball with a central 6.5\u00a0mm trephination, removal of the lens and iris and implantation and suturing of the TexKPRO. If required a silicone oil endotamponade was placed.\nAll eyes were stable with the keratoprosthesis. The first prototype showed conjunctival recession on the textile haptics with highly susceptible endopthalmitis risk due to infection of the PVDF so that we decided to remove the prosthesis from all eyes after one case of severe endophthalmitis occurred. The longest time of placement was 40 months and the shortest time 6 months. All eyes were restored by keratoplasty. In animals with the new haptic we found better conjunctivalization and stable implantation of the KPRO.\nThe textile KPRO provides a stable implantation procedure and safe connection of fibers to the scleral wound bed.

Images of fluorescent particles were obtained with a standard fluorescence microscope equipped with a piezo positioner for the objective. Whole pattern (WP) comparison with a PSF recorded for the specific set-up and measurement of the outermost ring radius (ORR) were used for analysis. Images of fluorescent particles were recorded over a large range (about 7\u03bcm) of vertical positions, with and without distortion by overlapping particles as well as in the presence of cultured endothelial cells. For a vertical range of 6.5\u03bcm the standard deviation (SD) from the predicted value, indicating validity, was 9.3/8.7 nm (WP/ORR) in the vertical and 8.2/11.7 nm in the horizontal direction. The precision, determined by repeated measurements, was 5.1/3.8 nm in the vertical and 2.9/3.7 nm in the horizontal direction. WP was more robust with respect to underexposure or overlapping images. On the surface of cultured endothelial cells, a layer with 2.5 times increased viscosity and a thickness of about 0.8\u03bcm was detected.

{"title": "Elongation of textile pelvic floor implants under load is related to complete loss of effective porosity, thereby favoring incorporation in scar plates.", "abstract": "Use of textile structures for reinforcement of pelvic floor structures has to consider mechanical forces to the implant, which are quite different to the tension free conditions of the abdominal wall. Thus, biomechanical analysis of textile devices has to include the impact of strain on stretchability and effective porosity. Prolift(\u00ae) and Prolift + M(\u00ae), developed for tension free conditions, were tested by measuring stretchability and effective porosity applying mechanical strain. For comparison, we used Dynamesh-PR4(\u00ae), which was designed for pelvic floor repair to withstand mechanical strain. Prolift(\u00ae) at rest showed moderate porosity with little stretchability but complete loss of effective porosity at strain of 4.9 N/cm. Prolift + M(\u00ae) revealed an increased porosity at rest, but at strain showed high stretchability, with subsequent loss of effective porosity at strain of 2.5 N/cm. Dynamesh PR4(\u00ae) preserved its high porosity even under strain, but as consequence of limited stretchability. Though in tension free conditions Prolift(\u00ae) and Prolift + M(\u00ae) can be considered as large pore class I meshes, application of mechanical strain rapidly lead to collapse of pores. The loss of porosity at mechanical stress can be prevented by constructions with high structural stability.

The authors are investigating the development of a piezoelectric composite biomaterial and interbody device design that could generate clinically relevant levels of electrical stimulation to help improve the rate of fusion for these patients. A lumped parameter model of the piezoelectric composite implant was developed based on a model that has been utilized to successfully predict power generation for piezoceramics. Seven variables (fiber material, matrix material, fiber volume fraction, fiber aspect ratio, implant cross-sectional area, implant thickness, and electrical load resistance) were parametrically analyzed to determine their effects on power generation within reasonable implant constraints. Influences of implant geometry and fiber aspect ratio were independent of material parameters. For a cyclic force of constant magnitude, implant thickness was directly and cross-sectional area inversely proportional to power generation potential. Fiber aspect ratios above 30 yielded maximum power generation potential while volume fractions above 15% showed superior performance. This investigation demonstrates the feasibility of using composite piezoelectric biomaterials in medical implants to generate therapeutic levels of direct current electrical stimulation.
