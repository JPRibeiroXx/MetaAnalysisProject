Appropriate mechanical loads offer an effective means to stimulate bone remodeling and prevent bone loss. A role of in situ strain in bone is considered essential in enhancement of bone formation, and establishing a quantitative relationship between 3D strain distributions and a rate of local bone formation is important. Digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) can achieve whole-field, non-contacting measurements of microscopic deformation for high-resolution determination of 3D strain distributions. However, the current system does not allow us to derive accurate strain distributions because of complex surface contours inherent to biological samples. Through development of a custom-made piezoelectric loading device as well as a new DSPI-based force calibration system, we built an advanced DSPI system and integrated local contour information to deformation data. Using a mouse femur in response to a knee loading modality as a model system, we determined 3D strain distributions and discussed effectiveness and limitations of the described system.", "journal": "Optics and lasers in engineering", "date": "2008-08-02", "authors": ["LianxiangYang", "PingZhang", "ShengLiu", "Praveen RSamala", "MinSu", "HirokiYokota"], "doi": "10.1016/j.optlaseng.2007.02.004"}

The reasons of septal nasal perforations are injuries, neoplasm, self-mutilation, chronic rhinitis, allergy, Wegener granuloma, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, toxic metals (arsenic, chrome), some drugs (steroids), narcotizing agents (cocaine) and complications after endoscopic and septal nasal operations. The surgical treatment, especially in the cases of large septal perforation, is often difficult because of the atrophy of nasal mucosa and lack of suitable material for reconstruction. In the surgical treatment many of methods and reconstructive materials have been used. The following autogenous tissues were used in the reconstruction of septal perforation: alloderm, temporal fascia, septal and auricle cartilage, cranial periosteum, perichondrium, ethmoidal and hip bone. The defect of such materials is progressive resorption. For many years the suitable synthetic material for septal nasal reconstruction has been searched for. Among the biomaterials the following have been used without success: Dacron, porous polyethylene, dolomite, bioglass. The rejection of synthetic material was the reason of failure. The aim of our study was to evaluate two different biomaterials with proper mechanical and biological features for nasal cartilage replacement.\nWe studied two types of biomaterials: biostable terpolymer PTFE/PVDF/PP and resorbable copolymer of glycolide and L-lactide (PGLA). The pilot studies were performed on two experimental animals (rabbits). The animals were operated in the general anesthesia. The biomaterials were implanted in the rabbit auricular cartilage because of its similarity to the septum and easy surgical access. Subperichondrically 1 x 1 cm fragment of the cartilage was removed. This fragment was then replaced with the biomaterial. The rabbits were painlessly sacrificed after 4 months of observation.\nA very good integration of PGLA implant with auricular cartilage was observed.

Hexavalent chromium was leached completely from soil with 0.01molL(-1) Na(3)PO(4). This was achieved by boiling the soil-reagent solution mixture for a period of 5min. The leached Cr(VI) was then quantified by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ET-AAS) after filtration of the sample solutions through Hydrophilic Millipore PVDF 0.45microm filter.

The spiking of soil samples with Cr(III) standards before pretreatment show that Cr(III) was not oxidized to Cr(VI) during leaching as the Cr(VI) content never increased.

The results revealed that compared with pure PZT, the width of Raman bands of 0.5PZN-0.5PZT was quite broad, indicating that the system has strong relaxor feature. According to the temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity, the indicator of degree of diffuseness, gamma, was calculated and the values were as high as 1.71.

The results indicated that for 0.5PZN-0.5PZT system, the fraction of rhombohedral phase was equal to the tetragonal phase, which has also been affirmed by XRD results and suggested that the system was close to the MPB.

A new method of determining ignition delay time of energetic materials behind incident shock wave is proposed. Several important products, such as H, C2 and CH, were determined in sequence of emergence time. The reaction mechanism of formation of carbon was introduced when benzene was driven under shock compression. The results indicate that in spite of the variety of Mach number, atom H always emerged first, indicating that the pyrolysis of benzene started with C-H bond instead of C-C bond. The results show that applying spectrum techniques can preferably study the ignition characteristic of benzene in quick reaction.

Such an analysis is a powerful tool to follow import intermediates and to study assembly of protein complexes. Analysis of import reactions by BNGE provides information on the molecular mass of the complex with which the imported precursor is associated.

The binding of soluble antibodies to specific complexes results in an observed shift in their apparent molecular mass (antibody shift).

The PVDF modified membrane was characterized by XPS, XRD, SEM and FTIR. The adsorption property, adsorption isotherm and batch sorption kinetics of Cu2+ by the PVDF modified membrane were studied. The results indicate that the adsorption processes for Cu2+ are found to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetics equation. And the isotherm of adsorption of Cu2+ by the modified membrane is good agreement with that of Langmuir isotherm model. The values of the mean free energies of the adsorption process are found to be between 8 and 16 kJ/mol, which shows that the adsorption mechanism of the PVDF modified membrane is an ion-exchange process. The value of deltaH0 is > 0, deltaG0 is < 0, and deltaS0 is > 0, which shows that the adsorption of the PVDF modified membrane is a spontaneous and endothermic process. The experimental data also show that the PVDF modified membrane possesses an excellent adsorption/desorption property. The adsorption capacity of Cu2+ onto the modified membrane in the synthesized Cu2+ solution and the sewage water is more than 0.025 mg/cm2 and 0.015 mg/cm2, respectively, and its desorption efficiency is still beyond to 95%, after four adsorption/desorption processes.

{"title": "Squeeze film effect for the design of an ultrasonic tactile plate.", "abstract": "Most tactile displays currently built rely on pin-based arrays. However, this kind of tactile device is not always appropriate when we need to give the illusion of finely textured surfaces. In this paper, we describe the squeeze film effect between a plate and a finger, and we use this effect to design an ultrasonic tactile plate. The plate is actuated by piezoelectric ceramics. Ultrasonic vibrations are thus produced and are capable of generating the squeeze film effect. This enables us to simulate variable friction on the surface of the plate. In order to identify the squeeze film phenomenon, this study considers the case where a finger, with a planar bottom surface and with epidermal ridges, is placed on a rapidly vibrating plate. The overpressure is calculated and the result enables us to assess the relative coefficient of friction as a function of the vibration amplitude of the plate. Based on this principle, and using both analytic and FE method studies, and given ergonomic and stimulation (squeeze film) requirements, we show that it is possible to design a tactile plate which is capable of giving programmable tactile sensations.

Compared to lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics, the large electromechanical coupling factor provides significant increases in transducer bandwidth. The superior strain energy density generates higher source level across the band, and the lower Young's modulus allows considerably smaller transducers. These payoffs occur even when PMNT crystals are subject to navy operating conditions such as uniaxial mechanical compressive stresses up to 42 MPa, electric fields up to 1.2 MV/m, and a temperature range from 5 to 50 degrees C. The impact of navy-relevant electric fields and mechanical stresses on crack propagation and failure of piezoelectric single crystals is investigated.

{"title": "Fabrication and characterization of annular thickness mode piezoelectric micro ultrasonic transducers.", "abstract": "Micromachining techniques, in combination with low temperature ceramic composite sol-gel processing, have been used to fabricate annular array thickness-mode piezoelectric micro ultrasonic transducers (Tm-pMUTs). The processing techniques of low temperature (710 degrees C) composite sol-gel ceramic (sol + ceramic powder) deposition and wet etching were used to deposit and structure 27-microm thick lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films on silicon substrates to produce annular array Tm-pMUTs. Using these techniques, high quality PZT materials with near bulk permittivity have been obtained. The Tm-pMUT devices were shown to resonate at approximately 60 MHz in air and 50 MHz in water. From resonance measurements k(t) values ranging between 0.2 and 0.47 have been calculated and shown to depend on the level of porosity within the film. Lower values of kt were observed for films with higher levels of porosity, which was attributed to the relative decrease in the effective piezoelectric coefficient epsilon(33) with respect to stiffness and permittivity as a function of increasing porosity. This paper presents the successful micro-fabrication of a Tm-pMUT device and discusses the optimization of the poling conditions and effect of PZT microstructure on the coupling coefficient k(t). Pulse echo measurements in water, showing a -6 dB center frequency of 53 MHz and 47% -6 dB bandwidth, using a target 15 mm away from the transducer, have been included to demonstrate successful operation of the device.

To determine this value without facing the practical problems and the long theoretical calculation time, we have shown that the mass sensitivity of SAW sensors can be calculated by a simple three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element analysis (FEA) using a commercial finite-element platform. The FEA data are used to calculate the wave propagation speed, surface particle displacements, and wave energy distribution on different cuts of various piezoelectric materials. The results are used to provide a simple method for evaluation of their mass sensitivities. Meanwhile, to calculate more accurate results from FEA data, surface and bulk wave reflection problems are considered in the analyses. In this research, different cuts of lithium niobate, quartz, lithium tantalate, and langasite piezoelectric materials are applied to investigate their acoustic wave properties.

Eighty-five participants (43 boys, 42 girls), ages 5-7 and 9-11 years, walked on a treadmill for two-minute bouts at speeds of 42, 66, and 90 m x min(-1) while wearing a spring-levered (Yamax SW-200) and a piezoelectric (New Lifestyles NL-2000) pedometer. The number of steps taken during each bout was also recorded using a hand counter Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from height and mass, and percentage of body fat (%BF) was determined using hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis. The tilt angle of the pedometer was assessed using a magnetic protractor. Both pedometers performed well at 66 and 90 m x min(-1), but undercounted steps by approximately 20% at 42 m x min(-1). Although age group, BMI, waist circumference, and %BF did not affect pedometer accuracy, children with large pedometer tilt angles (> or =10 degrees) showed significantly greater percent bias than those with small tilt angles (< 10 degrees). We suggest that the style of waistband on the child's clothing is a more important determinant of tilt angle and thus pedometer accuracy than body composition. Our results also indicate that the NL-2000 pedometer provides similar accuracy and better precision than the SW-200 pedometer, especially in children with large tilt angles.

{"title": "Carrier density and Schottky barrier on the performance of DC nanogenerator.", "abstract": "By assembling a ZnO nanowire (NW) array based nanogenerator (NG) that is transparent to UV light, we have investigated the performance of the NG by tuning its carrier density and the characteristics of the Schottky barrier at the interface between the metal electrode and the NW. The formation of a Schottky diode at the interface is a must for the effective operation of the NG. UV light not only increases the carrier density in ZnO but also reduces the barrier height. A reduced barrier height greatly weakens the function of the barrier for preserving the piezoelectric potential in the NW for an extended period of time, resulting in little output current. An increased carrier density speeds up the rate at which the piezoelectric charges are screened/neutralized, but a very low carrier density prevents the flow of current through the NWs. Therefore, there is an optimum conductance of the NW for maximizing the output of the NG. Our study provides solid evidence to further prove the mechanism proposed for the piezoelectric NG and piezotronics.

{"title": "Piezoelectric potential output from ZnO nanowire functionalized with p-type oligomer.", "abstract": "We have studied the piezoelectric potential output of a ZnO wire/belt functionalized with p-type oligomer (2,5-Bis(octanoxy)-1,4-bis(4-formyl phenylene vinylene) benzene) (OPV2) when it was deflected by an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip in contact mode. In comparison to the ZnO wire/belt without oligomer coating, an extra positive voltage peak was observed prior to the appearance of a negative potential peak. The paired positive and negative voltage peaks are the results of tip contact to the stretched and the compressed side of the wire/belt, corresponding to the positive and negative local piezoelectric potential, respectively. The p-n junction between OPV2 and ZnO serves as a \"diode\" that controls the flow of current. When the nanowire/nanobelt is first bent by the AFM tip, the diode is reversely biased and the piezoelectric charges are stored in the ZnO wire/belt. As the AFM tip further bends the wire/belt, the local piezoelectric potential is continuously accumulated to a value that is large enough to break through the diode. Then the free charges from the external circuit can flow in and neutralize/screen part of the piezoelectric charges, resulting in a positive pulse in the output signal. When the AFM tip continues to scan to reach the compressed side of the ZnO wire/belt, the p-n junction is forwardly biased. Neutralizing/screening the residual and the newly created piezoelectric charges leads to the flow of current from the tip to the ZnO wire/belt, resulting in a negative voltage pulse.

{"title": "Geometric triangular chiral hexagon crystal-like complexes organization in pathological tissues biological collision order.", "abstract": "The present study describes and documents self-assembly of geometric triangular chiral hexagon crystal like complex organizations (GTCHC) in human pathological tissues. The authors have found this architectural geometric expression at macroscopic and microscopic levels mainly in cancer processes. This study is based essentially on macroscopic and histopathologic analyses of 3000 surgical specimens: 2600 inflammatory lesions and 400 malignant tumours. Geometric complexes identified photographically at macroscopic level were located in the gross surgical specimen, and these areas were carefully dissected. Samples were taken to carry out histologic analysis. Based on the hypothesis of a collision genesis mechanism and because it is difficult to carry out an appropriate methodological observation in biological systems, the authors designed a model base on other dynamic systems to obtain indirect information in which a strong white flash wave light discharge, generated by an electronic device, hits over the lines of electrical conductance structured in helicoidal pattern. In their experimental model, the authors were able to reproduce and to predict polarity, chirality, helicoid geometry, triangular and hexagonal clusters through electromagnetic sequential collisions. They determined that similar events among constituents of extracelular matrix which drive and produce piezoelectric activity are responsible for the genesis of GTCHC complexes in pathological tissues. This research suggests that molecular crystals represented by triangular chiral hexagons derived from a collision-attraction event against collagen type I fibrils emerge at microscopic and macroscopic scales presenting a lateral assembly of each side of hypertrophy helicoid fibers, that represent energy flow in cooperative hierarchically chiral electromagnetic interaction in pathological tissues and arises as a geometry of the equilibrium in perturbed biological systems.

{"title": "An insight into the sialome of the soft tick, Ornithodorus parkeri.", "abstract": "While hard ticks (Ixodidae) take several days to feed on their hosts, soft ticks (Argasidae) feed faster, usually taking less than 1h per meal. Saliva assists in the feeding process by providing a cocktail of anti-hemostatic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodullatory compounds. Saliva of hard ticks has been shown to contain several families of genes each having multiple members, while those of soft ticks are relatively unexplored. Analysis of the salivary transcriptome of the soft tick Ornithodorus parkeri, the vector of the relapsing fever agent Borrelia parkeri, indicates that gene duplication events have led to a large expansion of the lipocalin family, as well as of several genes containing Kunitz domains indicative of serine protease inhibitors, and several other gene families also found in hard ticks. Novel protein families with sequence homology to insulin growth factor-binding protein (prostacyclin-stimulating factor), adrenomedulin, serum amyloid A protein precursor and similar to HIV envelope protein were also characterized for the first time in the salivary gland of a blood-sucking arthropod. The sialotranscriptome of O. parkeri confirms that gene duplication events are an important driving force in the creation of salivary cocktails of blood-feeding arthropods, as was observed with hard ticks and mosquitoes. Most of the genes coding for expanded families are homologous to those found in hard ticks, indicating a strong common evolutionary path between the two families. As happens to all genera of blood-sucking arthropods, several new proteins were also found, indicating the process of adaptation to blood feeding still continues to recent times.", "journal": "Insect biochemistry and molecular biology", "date": "2007-12-12", "authors": ["Ivo M BFrancischetti", "Ben JMans", "ZhaojingMeng", "NandaGudderra", "Timothy DVeenstra", "Van MPham", "Jos\u00e9 M CRibeiro"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.09.009"}

{"title": "[Study of thermal diffusivity by piezoelectric photoacoustic phase].", "abstract": "Piezoelectric photoacoustic phase information can be applied to determine the thermal diffusivity of sample. In actual experiments, the results of phase versus modulation frequency deviate from the theory heavily because of the disturbance of instrumental contribution from the whole detecting system. Considering that the instrumental contribution of phase from PA cell can be ignored reasonably, there will be no additional phase contribution after the piezoelectric PA cell has been replaced by microphone PA cell while the other experimental conditions have been kept invariable. Based on this hypothesis, the conventional photoacoustic cell with microphone is employed to determine the instrumental contribution of whole detecting system by studying the PA phase of solid rare earth complexes. The instrumental contribution of phase was considered to be constant for that the same detecting system was used in both the microphone PA method and piezoelectric PA method. This method has been proved by detecting the thermal diffusivity of aluminium sample. The corrected results of experiments match the theory well, showing that the method of subtracting the instrumental contribution from the original experimental phase can be applied reasonably in relevant chopping frequency region.

Its novelty lies in the exploitation of the pyroelectric properties of a thin membrane of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The membrane is backed by a thick layer of polyurethane rubber that is extremely attenuating to ultrasound, with the result that the majority of the applied acoustic power is absorbed within a few millimeters of the membrane-backing interface. Through the resultant rapid increase in temperature of the membrane, a voltage is generated across its electrodes whose magnitude is proportional to the rate of change of temperature with respect to time. Changes in the pyroelectric voltage generated by switching the transducer ON and OFF are related to the acoustic power delivered by the transducer. Features of the technique are explored through the development of a simple one-dimensional model. An experimental evaluation of the potential secondary measurement technique is also presented, covering the frequency range 1 to 5 MHz, for delivered powers up to a watt.

The aim of this study was to test the Piezosurgery as a new and alternative method for the excision of middle-ear tumors and to analyze its effects on soft tissues.\nThe Piezosurgery device was used to excise eight glomus tympanicum tumors and two primary B-cell lymphomas of the middle ear. The piezoelectric device uses low-frequency ultrasonic waves (24.7-29.5 kHz); the applied power can be modulated between 2.8 and 16 W and is programmed in accordance to the density of the bone. The equipment consists of two hand-pieces, two inserts, and two peristaltic pumps. The microvibrations that are created in the piezoelectric hand-piece cause the inserts to vibrate linearly by between 60 and 210 microm.\nPiezosurgery provided excellent control in all the patients, without bleeding and harmful effects on the adjacent structures of the middle and inner ear.\nPiezosurgery is a new and revolutionary osteotomy technique utilizing the microvibrations of scalpels at ultrasonic frequency, so that soft tissue will not be damaged even upon accidental contact with the cutting tip. The vibration frequency of Piezosurgery is optimal for mineralized tissue and does not cut the adjacent soft tissue, minimizing the risk of harming the adjacent tissues.

{"title": "Intracellular levels and activity of PvdS, the major iron starvation sigma factor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "abstract": "In Pseudomonas aeruginosa the iron starvation sigma factor PvdS directs the transcription of pyoverdine and virulence genes under iron limitation. PvdS activity is modulated by pyoverdine through the surface signalling cascade involving the FpvA receptor and the inner membrane-spanning sensor FpvR. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms enabling PvdS to compete with the major sigma RpoD for RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding, we determined the intracellular levels of RNAP, RpoD and PvdS in P. aeruginosa PAO1, and the effect of pyoverdine signalling on PvdS activity. Under iron limitation, P. aeruginosa contains 2221 and 933 molecules of RNAP and RpoD per cell respectively. PvdS attains 62% of RpoD levels. The high PvdS content is partly offset by retention of 30% of PvdS on the membrane, lowering the concentration of cytosolic PvdS to 45% of RpoD levels. RNAP purification from iron-starved P. aeruginosa cells demonstrated that PvdS-RNAP is poorly represented compared with RpoD-RNAP (1 and 27% of total RNAP respectively). Pyoverdine signalling does not affect the PvdS cellular content but facilitates PvdS release from the membrane, increasing its cytosolic concentration from 35% in both pvdF and fpvA signalling mutants to 70% in the wild type and 83% in the fpvR mutant.", "journal": "Molecular microbiology", "date": "2007-12-01", "authors": ["FedericaTiburzi", "FrancescoImperi", "PaoloVisca"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.06051.x"}

{"title": "Developmental changes of mechanics measured in the gerbil cochlea.", "abstract": "This report describes stiffness and best frequency measurements obtained in vitro from the basilar membrane of the gerbil cochlea at the onset of hearing, during hearing maturation, and after hearing has matured. Our stiffness data constitute the first direct experimental evidence of developmental stiffness changes in the basal and middle turns. Stiffness changes by a factor of 5.5 in the basal turn between postnatal day 11 and adult, and the difference from adult is statistically significant for all ages measured up to postnatal day 16. For the middle turn, stiffness changes by a factor of 1.6 between postnatal day 11 and adult. Whereas for postnatal day 12 and beyond there is no statistically significant difference from adult, our data suggest that there may be a significant difference of stiffness between day 11 and adult in the middle turn. For the basal turn, our motion measurements confirm a passive component to the developmental best frequency shift. For the middle turn, changes in best frequency are not statistically significant. Best frequency was determined by stimulating the tissue at audio frequencies with a glass paddle and measuring motion with a computer-based imaging system. Tissue stiffness was measured with a piezoelectric-based sensor system. Tissue stiffness changes have previously been postulated to contribute to the best frequency shift observed in the cochlear base. Incorporating our data into a simple spring-mass resonance model demonstrates that our experimentally measured stiffness change can account for the change of best frequency. These results suggest that a stiffness change is, in fact, a critical component of the best frequency shift observed in the basal turn of the gerbil cochlea after the onset of hearing.", "journal": "Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology : JARO", "date": "2007-11-30", "authors": ["GulamEmadi", "Claus-PeterRichter"], "doi": "10.1007/s10162-007-0104-9\n10.1016/0378-5955(88)90149-9\n10.1007/BF01420984\n10.1038/341147a0\n10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00090-2\n10.1152/jn.00446.2003\n10.1007/BF00056772\n10.1121/1.387144\n10.1126/science.6463651\n10.1016/0378-5955(94)90046-9\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/4/310\n10.1016/0378-5955(95)00015-V\n10.1121/1.392041\n10.1121/1.415857\n10.1121/1.417985\n10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00079-3\n10.1016/0378-5955(95)00230-8\n10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00133-6\n10.1016/0378-5955(91)90008-W\n10.1121/1.408331\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.025205\n10.1159/000067892\n10.1121/1.1914569\n10.1007/s101620010019\n10.1016/0378-5955(96)00063-9\n10.1016/0378-5955(84)90081-9\n10.1016/0378-5955(85)90011-5\n10.1016/0378-5955(89)90146-9"}

Absence of resonance frequency shift indicated that EC was not present in the 30 samples tested. Following the last sample in each food matrix, 1,000 cells per ml of EC were spiked into the sample container, and resonance frequency change was monitored. The total resonance frequency change was 880 +/- 5, 1,875 +/- 8, and 1,417 +/- 4 Hz for spinach, spring lettuce mix, and ground beef, respectively. A mixture of the three food matrices spiked with 100 cells per ml of EC gave a sensor response of 260 +/- 15 Hz. The resonance frequency changes are approximately 40% lower than our previously reported study on ground beef.

A PEC with a thin nonpiezoelectric extension has two distinctive sections, each with a different thickness, different axial density, and elastic-modulus profiles and has been increasingly used as an in-situ biosensor. It has the advantages of dipping only the nonpiezoelectric extension part in an aqueous solution without electrically insulating the piezoelectric section as well as serving as the bonding pad for receptor immobilization. In this study, we examined the effect of the thin nonpiezoelectric extension on the flexural resonance spectrum and resonance vibration waveforms of PEC; in particular, how the length ratio between the piezoelectric section and the nonpiezoelectric extension section affects the resonance frequencies and resonance peak intensities of PEC. Theoretical resonance frequencies and resonance vibration waveforms were obtained using an analytical transcendental equation we derived by solving the flexural wave equation. Both experimental and theoretical results showed that the two-section structure distorted the flexural vibration waveforms from those of PEC without an extension. As a result, the higher-mode resonance peaks of PEC with a nonpiezoelectric extension could be higher than the first resonance peak due to the two-section structure. With PEC that has a piezoelectric section of 0.25-mm thick PZT bonded to 0.07 mm thick stainless steel of various length 11 and a 0.07-mm thick nonpiezoelectric extension of length l2, we showed that the first-mode-to-second-mode resonance peak intensity ratio had a maximum of 5.6 at l1/l2 = 0.75 and the first-mode-to-second-mode resonance frequency ratio a minimum of 2.2 at 11/12 = 1.8.

The larger the load resistance, the larger the vibration gradient is. At the resonant frequency, the vibration gradient decreases with increasing the width of the input or output section, and it changes little with the length and thickness of the transformer when the load resistance matches with the piezoelectric transformer.

{"title": "Simulation of absolute amplitudes of ultrasound signals using equivalent circuits.", "abstract": "Equivalent circuits for piezoelectric devices and ultrasonic transmission media can be used to cosimulate electronics and ultrasound parts in simulators originally intended for electronics. To achieve efficient system-level optimization, it is important to simulate correct, absolute amplitude of the ultrasound signal in the system, as this determines the requirements on the electronics regarding dynamic range, circuit noise, and power consumption. This paper presents methods to achieve correct, absolute amplitude of an ultrasound signal in a simulation of a pulse-echo system using equivalent circuits. This is achieved by taking into consideration loss due to diffraction and the effect of the cable that connects the electronics and the piezoelectric transducer. The conductive loss in the transmission line that models the propagation media of the ultrasound pulse is used to model the loss due to diffraction. Results show that the simulated amplitude of the echo follows measured values well in both near and far fields, with an offset of about 10%. The use of a coaxial cable introduces inductance and capacitance that affect the amplitude of a received echo. Amplitude variations of 60% were observed when the cable length was varied between 0.07 m and 2.3 m, with simulations predicting similar variations. The high precision in the achieved results show that electronic design and system optimization can rely on system simulations alone.

The relation between the Lamb wave phase velocity and the liquid density can be used for liquid density sensing. In this paper, utilizing the partial wave theory, the concept of effective permittivity is introduced to analyze the Lamb wave's excitation and the phase velocity calculation under a certain liquid density. The interface between the Lamb wave device and the liquid layer is metallized to eliminate the influence of liquid electrical properties when sensing liquid density. Based on the theory model, the phase difference measurement method is adopted to study the device's sensitivity to liquid density. In order to achieve high sensitivity to liquid density with sufficient excitation efficiency of Lamb wave, the optimal parameters of the Lamb wave device including plate thickness and cut orientation are obtained by numerical calculation. The experimental results are found to be in agreement with the theoretical simulations, verifying the validity of the theory model and the practicability of the optimization design.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2007-11-21", "authors": ["ZhijunChen", "LiangerLi", "WenkangShi", "HuaweiGuo"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2007.488"}
{"title": "Mathematical optimization of multilayer piezoelectric devices with nonuniform layers by simulated annealing.", "abstract": "Multilayer ultrasonic transducers with layers of uniform design are in common use. It is also possible to devise such transducers in which the layer design is nonuniform. However, this adds many degrees of freedom to the transducer design, and conventional design techniques are inadequate to realize desired behavior or even to assess potential benefits. In this paper, a theoretical investigation of multilayer piezoelectric structures with nonuniform layers is reported. Results are presented from a study using computer code to solve the one-dimensional wave equation. It is first shown how multilayer structures with nonuniform layer thicknesses generate even and odd harmonics in their frequency response, suggesting that frequency response can be controlled by choice of layer thickness. However, this choice is complicated and it is impossible to analyze all possible combinations of layer thicknesses. Hence, use of the stochastic optimization technique of simulated annealing is reported. Two optimized transducer designs illustrate this. The first design maximizes uniformity of the fundamental, second, and third harmonics of pressure output, achieved to approximately +/-3%. The results suggest additional bandwidth can be achieved for practical applications, as the presence of a finite response at the second harmonic frequency avoids the null usually associated with this frequency. This is further illustrated with the second optimized transducer design in the form of a three-layer 1-3 connectivity piezo-composite transducer for underwater operation.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2007-11-21", "authors": ["AneelaAbrar", "SandyCochran"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2007.484"}

In this paper, we explore the viability of using plasma-induced graft copolymerization to reduce the pore sizes of ENMs. Poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) was electrospun to produce a nonwoven membrane, comprised of nanofibers with diameters in the range of 200-600 nm. The surface of the ENM was exposed to argon plasma and subsequently graft-copolymerized with methacrylic acid. The effect of plasma exposure time on grafting was studied for both the ENM and a commercial hydrophobic PVDF (HVHP) membrane. The grafting density was quantitatively measured with toluidine blue-O. The degree of grafting increased steeply with an increase in plasma exposure time for the ENM, attaining a maximum of 180 nmol/mg after 120 s of plasma treatment. However, the increase in the grafting density on the surface of the HVHP membrane was not as drastic, reaching a plateau of 65 nmol/mg after 60 s. The liquid entry permeation of water dropped extensively for both membranes, indicating a change in surface properties. Field emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs revealed an alteration in the surface pore structure for both membranes after grafting. Bubble point measurements of the ENM reduced from 3.6 to 0.9 um after grafting. The pore-size distribution obtained using the capillary flow porometer for the grafted ENM revealed that it had a similar profile to that of a commercial hydrophilic commercial PVDF (HVLP) membrane. More significantly, water filtration studies revealed that the grafted ENM had a better flux throughput than the HVLP membrane. This suggests that ENMs can be successfully engineered through surface modification to achieve smaller pores while retaining their high flux performance.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2007-11-17", "authors": ["SatinderpalKaur", "ZuweiMa", "RenugaGopal", "GurdevSingh", "SeeramRamakrishna", "TakeshiMatsuura"], "doi": "10.1021/la701329r"}

This sensor measures pressure fluctuation due to respiration and heartbeat on the contact surface when a subject is lying on it. Since the AlN film sensor has good sensitivity, the pressure fluctuation measured can be further separated into signals corresponding to respiration and heartbeat, respectively.

The micromanipulator formed a two-finger micro hand, and it could handle a micron-scale object using a chopstick motion. For performing operations inside the MRI gantry in a manner such that the MRI is not disturbed, the system was designed to be nonmagnetic and electromagnetically compatible with the MRI. The micro-manipulator was implemented with piezoelectric transducers (PZT) as actuators for micro-motion, strain gauges as sensors for closed-loop control, and a flexure parallel mechanism made of acrylic plastic. Its compatibility with a 2-Tesla MRI was preliminarily tested by checking if the MRI obtained with the micromanipulator were similar to those obtained without the micromanipulator. The tests concluded that the micromanipulator caused no distortion but small artifacts on the MRI. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MRI significantly deteriorated mainly due to the wiring of the micromanipulator.

Depending on the desired properties of such substituted highly porous matrix materials, optimized synthesis routes can be established to enhance the desired internal pore surface-affinity toward certain volatile compounds. On the basis of a fundamental knowledge of the host-guest system, sorption-related applications may benefit from individually fine-tuned and modified sample materials. The sorption isotherms of vaporized toluene on nonmodified and phenyl-functionalized mesoporous silica samples were determined on an acoustic wave device at different temperatures. The mesoporous silica was modified by in situ co-condensation and postsynthesis grafting approaches, respectively. All samples were thoroughly characterized by nitrogen sorption, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si NMR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Raman spectroscopy, and toluene adsorption on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The different heats of adsorption of toluene on the various modified silica surfaces obtained by the sorption data make it possible to gain additional information about the degree and type of surface functionalization. It is thus demonstrated that QCM studies can be a powerful and convenient tool for efficient investigations of functionalized mesoporous silica particles that yield valuable quantitative information on molecule-surface interactions.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2007-11-16", "authors": ["AlexanderDarga", "JohannKecht", "ThomasBein"], "doi": "10.1021/la701962b"}

{"title": "Schneiderian membrane perforation rate during sinus elevation using piezosurgery: clinical results of 100 consecutive cases.", "abstract": "The lateral window sinus elevation procedure has become a routine and highly successful preprosthetic procedure that is used to increase bone volume in the posterior maxilla for the placement of dental implants. Many surgical techniques have been proposed that provide access to the maxillary sinus through the lateral wall to allow for elevation of the sinus membrane. Among these are the multiple variations of the hinge and complete osteotomy techniques, which make use of rotary cutting instruments for the antrostomy. The most common intraoperative complication with these surgical approaches is perforation of the schneiderian membrane, with perforation rates of 14% to 56% reported in the literature. In most instances, perforation occurs either while using rotary instruments to make the window or when using hand instruments to gain initial access to begin the elevation of the membrane from the sinus walls. This article presents an alternative approach that uses a piezoelectric instrument for the sinus elevation procedure. Although new to the United States, this approach has been used successfully in Europe for many years. The membrane perforation rate in this series of 100 consecutive cases using the piezoelectric technique has been reduced from the average reported rate of 30% with rotary instrumentation to 7%.

{"title": "Theoretical modelling of frequency dependent elastic loss in composite piezoelectric transducers.", "abstract": "The large number of degrees of freedom in the design of piezoelectric transducers requires a theoretical model that is computationally efficient so that a large number of iterations can be performed in the design optimisation. The materials used are often lossy, and indeed loss can be used to enhance the operational characteristics of these designs. Motivated by these needs, this paper extends the one-dimensional linear systems model to incorporate frequency dependent elastic loss. The reception sensitivity, electrical impedance and electromechanical coupling coefficient of a 1-3 composite transducer, with frequency dependent loss in the polymer filler, are investigated. By plotting these operating characteristics as a function of the volume fraction of piezoelectric ceramic an optimum design is obtained. A device with a non-standard, high shear attenuation polymer is also simulated and this leads to an increase in the electromechanical coupling coefficient. A comparison with finite element simulations is then performed. This shows that the two methods are in reasonable agreement in their electrical impedance profiles in all the cases considered. The plots are almost identical away from the main resonant peak where the frequency location of the peaks are comparable but there is in some cases a 20% discrepancy in the magnitude of the peak value and in its bandwidth.

{"title": "A line-scanning semi-confocal multi-photon fluorescence microscope with a simultaneous broadband spectral acquisition and its application to the study of the thylakoid membrane of a cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7120.", "abstract": "We describe the construction and characterization of a laser-line-scanning microscope capable of detection of broad fluorescence spectra with a resolution of 1 nm. A near-infrared femtosecond pulse train at 800 nm was illuminated on a line (one lateral axis, denoted as X axis) in a specimen by a resonant scanning mirror oscillating at 7.9 kHz, and total multi-photon-induced fluorescence from the linear region was focused on the slit of an imaging polychromator. An electron-multiplying CCD camera was used to resolve fluorescence of different colours at different horizontal pixels and fluorescence of different spatial positions in a specimen at different vertical pixels. Scanning on the other two axes (Y and Z) was achieved by a closed-loop controlled sample scanning stage and a piezo-driven objective actuator. The full widths at half maximum of the point-spread function of the system were estimated to be 0.39-0.40, 0.33 and 0.56-0.59 mum for the X (lateral axis along the line-scan), Y (the other lateral axis) and Z axes (the axial direction), respectively, at fluorescence wavelengths between 644 and 690 nm. A biological application of this microscope was demonstrated in a study of the sub-cellular fluorescence spectra of thylakoid membranes in a cyanobacterium, Anabaena PCC7120. It was found that the fluorescence intensity ratio between chlorophyll molecules mainly of photosystem II and phycobilin molecules of phycobilisome (chlorophyll/phycobilin), in the thylakoid membranes, became lower as one probed deeper inside the cells. This was attributable not to position dependence of re-absorption or scattering effects, but to an intrinsic change in the local physiological state of the thylakoid membrane, with the help of a transmission spectral measurement of sub-cellular domains.

{"title": "Mechanism involved in the evolution of physically irreversible fouling in microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes used for drinking water treatment.", "abstract": "Control of membrane fouling is important for more efficient use of membranes in water treatment. Control of physically irreversible fouling, which is defined as fouling that requires chemical cleaning to be cancelled, is particularly important for reduction of operation cost in a membrane process. In this study, a long-term filtration experiment using three different types of MF and UF membranes was carried out at an existing water purification plant, and the evolution of physically irreversible fouling was investigated. The experimental results demonstrated that the extent of physically irreversible fouling differed significantly depending on the membrane type. Cleaning of the fouled membranes with various chemical reagents demonstrated that organic matter was mainly responsible for physically irreversible fouling. Organic matter that had caused physically irreversible fouling in the long-term operation was desorbed from the fouled membranes and was subjected to Fourier transform infrared and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. These analyses revealed that carbohydrates were dominant in the membrane foulant regardless of the type of membrane. Based on measurements of molecular weight distribution of organic matter in the feedwater and the permeates from the membranes, a two-step fouling mechanism is proposed to explain the dominance of carbohydrates in the foulant: hydrophobic (humic-like) components with small molecular weight are first adsorbed on the membrane and, consequently, narrow the size of micro-pores of membranes, and then hydrophilic (carbohydrate-like) compounds with larger molecular weight plug the narrowed pores or the hydrophilic compounds are adsorbed onto the membrane surface conditioned by the hydrophobic components.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2007-11-01", "authors": ["HiroshiYamamura", "KatsukiKimura", "YoshimasaWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1021/es0629054"}

The PNA probe can combine to target DNA sequences more effectively and specifically than a DNA probe. The PNA probe was designed and immobilized on the surface of the biosensor to substitute the conventional DNA probe for direct detection of HBV genomic DNA without previous amplification by PCR. The hybridization assay was completed in 50 min. The detection limit was 8.6 pg/L and the clinical specificity was 94.44% compared with real time-PCR (RT-PCR). The PNA probe was able to distinguish sequences that differ only in one base.

Three-dimensional piezoelectric force transducers measured pedal forces. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVAs.\nSubjects with cerebral palsy spent a smaller percentage (P<.001, r2=.09, power=1.0) of the revolution applying positive force (pushing into the pedal during the extension phase) and a greater percentage (P<.001, r2=.09, power=1.0) of the revolution applying negative force (pulling away from the pedal during the flexion phase). There was no effect of cadence and no interaction effect.\nThese findings compliment our earlier findings of altered joint kinematics and muscle activity indicating that subjects with cerebral palsy and typical development have different cycling strategies.

Parameters included are electromechanical coupling, phase velocity, transducer capacitance, metal strip reflectivity, and temperature coefficient of frequency. Using previously published fundamental material constants, extracted parameters are compared with predictions for LGT and LGN.

Furthermore, by using the multilayer ceramics the output power was found to increase by 100%.

The hydrophone response was characterized by means of a primary interferometric calibration technique, by substitution calibration using time-delay spectrometry, and by complex broadband pulse calibration using nonlinear sound propagation. The results show a flat frequency response up to 40 MHz (maximum variations below +/-0.6 dB) and a thickness mode resonance at about 105 MHz. They indicate a useable bandwidth up to 140 MHz.

The presence of fluid in the sinuses of an ex vivo human skull was examined using a pulse-echo method by transmitting an ultrasound beam through the maxilla bone toward the back wall on the other side of the sinus cavity. The pulser was programmed to generate bipolar pulse trains with 5 cycles at a frequency of 1 MHz, repetition frequency of about 20 Hz, and amplitude of 100 V to drive a 1-MHz piezoelectric transducer. Shear and longitudinal waves in the maxilla bone were produced by adjusting the bone surface incident angle to 45 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. Computer tomography (CT) scans of the skull were performed to verify the ultrasound experiment. Using the shear mode technique, the echo waveform clearly distinguishes the presence of fluid, and the estimated distance of the ultrasound traveled in the sinus is consistent with the measurement from the CT images. Contrarily, using the longitudinal mode, no detectable back wall echo was observed under the same conditions.

In the present study, we performed ICSI-mediated gene transfer using pig sperm subjected to various pretreatments and determined the developmental potential of sperm-injected oocytes and introduction efficiency of exogenous DNA. Embryos were then transferred to recipient pigs to confirm gene transfer efficiency during the fetal period. When ICSI was performed using unfrozen sperm heads with tails removed by piezo-pulse, the rates of blastocyst formation (14.2%, 17/120) and transgene (EGFP) expression (11.8%, 2/17) were both low. When unfrozen sperm heads were used that were removed by sonication, EGFP expression efficiency (11/21, 52.4%) improved significantly (P<0.05). Pretreatment of unfrozen sperm with a surfactant or acrosomal reaction did not further improve the rates of blastocyst formation and EGFP expression. However, use of the heads of sperm frozen-thawed with or without a cryoprotective agent resulted in rates of blastocyst formation and EGFP expression that tended to be generally high (23.0%, 14/61-33.8%, 26/77 and 42.9%, 6/14-66.7%, 10/15).

The objectives of this study are to quantify differences in performance among sterilizing-grade membrane devices as a function of device type and size, to develop an understanding of the factors that affect device scalability, and to develop a mathematical model to predict a cartridge-to-disc scalability factor based on membrane properties and porous support properties and dimensions. Measured and predicted normalized water permeability scalability factors for seven types of pleated cartridges, including 0.1-micro and 0.2-micro rated PES, and 0.2-micro rated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sterilizing-grade filters in nominal 1-inch to 5-inch lengths, were determined. The results of this study indicate that pleated cartridge performance can be closely predicted based on 47-mm disc performance provided that a number of measured device parameters are properly accounted for, most importantly parasitic pressure losses in the filter device and plumbing connections, intrinsic membrane variability, true effective device filtration area, and the hydraulic properties of all porous support materials. Throughput scalability factors (discs to devices) tend to converge towards unity, especially for highly plugging streams. As the membrane fouls, the resistance through the membrane dominates other resistances, so the flux scales more linearly with membrane area and the overall scaling factor becomes close to one. The results of throughput tests on seven different cartridge types and five different challenge streams (with widely varying fouling characteristics) show that most of the throughput scaling factors were within +/-10% of 1.0. As part of this study, the effects of pressure and temperature were also evaluated. Neither of these factors was found to have a significant effect on scalability.", "journal": "PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology", "date": "2007-10-16", "authors": ["SalGiglia", "DavidYavorsky"], "doi": null}

The target sites were randomly treated with either a newly developed piezo-driven ultrasonic device Vector--or ultrasonic system (VUS) + CHX chip or VUS alone without adjunctive antimicrobial treatment. The clinical parameters, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), BOP, PD and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months.\nAt baseline, there were no significant differences between test and control sites for any of the investigated parameters. The average reduction of PD and improvement in CAL was greater in the VUS + CHX chip sites than in sites treated with the VUS alone at 1, 3 and 6 months (P < 0.05). The mean reductions on PD and CAL were 0.7 and 0.6 mm for the control sites and 2.2 and 1.9 mm for the test sites, respectively. Also, the mean reduction in BOP scores were higher in the VUS + CHX chip sites compared to VUS alone at 1, 3 and 6 months (P < 0.05). PI scores were not significantly different between VUS + CHX chip sites and VUS alone sites at any visit.\nThese data suggest that CHX chip application following SRP with the tested ultrasonic device is beneficial in improving periodontal parameters in patients on SPT.", "journal": "International journal of dental hygiene", "date": "2007-10-12", "authors": ["AdrianKasaj", "AlexandraChiriachide", "BritaWillershausen"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1601-5037.2007.00255.x"}

The surfaces of the samples were exposed to different type of piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler inserts and air-abrasive unit. The scaler inserts were Instrument A, Instrument PS and PI. The roughness of the surfaces of each sample were measured with a profilometer and observed by stereomicroscope.\nThe stereomicroscopic images and profilometric values showed that Instrument A and PS resulted in rough surfaces, such as chips, nicks and scratches on the amalgam, composite and porcelain surfaces. The Instrument PI roughened the amalgam surface, but it did not roughen the porcelain or composite surfaces. The profilometric measurements (Ra) showed that the roughness of the surfaces depending on air polishing was less than the ultrasonically scaled surfaces.\nThe wrong tip applications during dental scaling procedure cause roughness, such as scratches, nicks or chips, not only on the teeth surfaces but also on the filling materials.

Results indicate that the material loss of the electrode has no visible effect on the characterization of the effective electromechanical coupling factor, k(eff)2. The acoustic impedance ratio of the electrode to the piezo-film dominantly determines the behaviors of the k(eff)2 variation with the electrode thickness. The resonance Q value, Q(s), of the FBAR closely relies on the material Q values of film and of electrodes as expected. Besides, the variation of Q(s) versus the thickness of the electrodes crucially depends on the acoustic impedance ratio as well. Especially, three characteristic parameters, i.e., the maximum value of k(eff)2, the sectional mass ratio of the electrode to the piezo film corresponding to the maximum k(eff)2, and the tolerance range of the ratio to keep k(eff)2 near the maximum, are calculated for some typical samples.

{"title": "Optimal design of resonant piezoelectric buzzer from a perspective of vibration-absorber theory.", "abstract": "In this paper, an optimization technique is presented for the design of piezoelectric buzzers. This design technique aims at finding the optimal configuration of the coupled cavity and diaphragm structure to maximize the sound pressure output. Instead of measuring the material constants of the piezoelectric ceramic and the metal diaphragm, an \"added-mass method\" is developed to estimate the equivalent electromechanical parameters of the system on which an analogous circuit can be established. The electrical impedance and on-axis sound pressure level of the piezoelectric buzzer can be simulated by solving the loop equations of the electromechanoacoustical analogous circuit. An interesting finding of this research is that the nature of the piezoelectric buzzer bears remarkable resemblance to that in the dynamic vibration absorber theory. Much physical insight can be gained by exploiting this resemblance in search of the optimal configuration. According to the system characteristic equation, a design chart was devised to \"lock\" the critical frequency at which the system delivers the maximal output. On the basis of the analogous circuit and the vibration absorber theory, an optimal design was found with constrained optimization formalism. Experiments were conducted to justify the optimal design. The results showed that the performance was significantly improved using the optimal design over the original design.

The design and construction of fluidic platforms are well-developed areas due to the perfectly established microfabrication technologies used. However, there is still the need to achieve devices that include not only the fluid management system but also the measurement electronics, so that real portable miniaturized analyzers can be obtained. Low-temperature co-fired ceramics technology permits the incorporation of actuators, such as micropumps and microvalves, controlled either magnetically, piezoelectrically, or thermally. Furthermore, electronic circuits can be also easily built exploiting the properties of these ceramics and the fact that they can be fabricated using a multilayer approach. In this work, taking advantage of the possibility of combining fluidics and electronics in a single substrate and using the same fabrication methodology, a chemical microanalyzer that integrates microfluidics, the detection system, and also the data acquisition and digital signal processing electronics is presented. To demonstrate the versatility of the technology, two alternative setups have been developed. In the first one, a modular configuration is proposed. In this case, the same electronic module can be used to determine different chemical parameters by simply exchanging the chemical module. In the second one, the monolithic integration of all the elements was accomplished, allowing the construction of compact and dedicated devices.

These potentials arise as a result of activation of the sacculus and are expressed through the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). Up to now, the ascending projections of the sacculus are unknown in humans, only the representation of the semicircular canals or the entire vestibular nerve has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine whether a sacculus stimulus that evoked VEMPs could activate vestibular cortical areas in fMRI. To determine this, we studied the differential effects of unilateral VEMP stimulation in 21 healthy right-handers in a clinical 1.5 T scanner while wearing piezo electric headphones. A unilateral VEMP stimulus and two auditory control stimuli were given in randomized order over the stimulated ear. A random effects statistical analysis was done with SPM2 (p<0.05, corrected). After exclusion of the auditory effects, the major findings were as follows: (i) significant activations were located in the multisensory cortical vestibular network within both hemispheres, including the posterior insular cortex, the middle and superior temporal gyri, and the inferior parietal cortex. (ii) The activation pattern was elicited bilaterally with a predominance of the right hemisphere in right-handers. (iii) Saccular vestibular projection was predominantly ipsilateral, whereas (iv) pure acoustic stimuli were processed with a predominance of the respective contralateral and mainly in the left hemisphere. This is the first demonstration by means of fMRI of the cortical representation of the saccular input at cortical level. The activation pattern is similar to that known from the stimulation of the entire vestibular nerve or the horizontal semicircular canal.

{"title": "Analytical performance of a venturi-assisted array of micromachined ultrasonic electrosprays coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry for the analysis of peptides and proteins.", "abstract": "The analytical characterization of a novel ion source for mass spectrometry named array of micromachined ultrasonic electrosprays (AMUSE) is presented here. This is a fundamentally different type of ion generation device, consisting of three major components: (1) a piezoelectric transducer that creates ultrasonic waves at one of the resonant frequencies of the sample-filled device, (2) an array of pyramidally shaped nozzles micromachined on a silicon wafer, and (3) a spacer which prevents contact between the array and transducer ensuring the transfer of acoustic energy to the sample. A high-pressure gradient generated at the apexes of the nozzle pyramids forces the periodic ejection of multiple droplet streams from the device. With this device, the processes of droplet formation and droplet charging are separated; hence, the limitations of conventional electrospray-type ion sources, including the need for high charging potentials and the addition of organic solvent to decrease surface tension, can be avoided. In this work, a Venturi device is coupled with AMUSE in order to increase desolvation, droplet focusing, and signal stability. Results show that ionization of model peptides and small tuning molecules is possible with dc charging potentials of 100 Vdc or less. Ionization in rf-only mode (without dc biasing) was also possible. It was observed that, when combined with AMUSE, the Venturi device provides a 10-fold gain in signal-to-noise ratio for 90% aqueous sample solutions. Further reduction in the diameter of the orifices of the micromachined arrays led to an additional signal gain of at least 3 orders of magnitude, a 2-10-fold gain in the signal-to-noise ratio and an improvement in signal stability from 47% to 8.5% RSD. The effectiveness of this device for the soft ionization of model proteins in aqueous media, such as cytochrome c, was also examined, yielding spectra with an average charge state of 8.8 when analyzed with a 100 Vdc charging potential.

Novel clinical and research tools for characterizing the hemostatic system are of continued interest, and the object of this research is to test the hypothesis that clinically relevant platelet function can be monitored using an electromechanical sensor. A piezoelectric thickness shear mode (TSM) biosensor coated with collagen-I fibers to promote platelet activation and adhesion was developed and tested for sensitivity to detect these primary events. Magnitude and frequency response of the sensor were monitored under static conditions at 37 degrees C, using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and PRP with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), a clinical aggregation inhibitor (abciximab), or a collagen binding inhibitor. Sensors loaded with PRP exhibited a 3-stage response; no significant change in response for the first 20 min (Stage-1), followed by a larger drop in response (Stage-2) and subsequently, response gradually increased (Stage-3). Exogenous ADP stimulated an immediate Stage-2 response, while abciximab delayed and reduced the magnitude change of Stage-2. In the presence of collagen inhibitor, Stage-2 response was similar to that of control but was delayed by an additional 20 min.

{"title": "Dynamics of probes attached to quartz tuning forks for the detection of surface forces.", "abstract": "The dynamics of force microscopy probes attached to quartz tuning fork piezoelectric sensors has been investigated, by simply modeling the tuning fork/probe system as two coupled damped harmonic oscillators. Depending on how probes are applied to the tuning fork prong, they could show appreciable compliance along the direction of approach to the surface. In particular, buckling or bending deformation of the probe may account for unexpectedly long interaction ranges found in experimental approach curves. Some peculiar curves found in the literature in the case of lateral probe oscillation (shear force) are well reproduced by the present model. In particular, a 'clamping' effect is observed when the probe is substantially more compliant than the tuning fork. By calculating the actual probe motion along with the tuning fork response, the correct distance control operation regimes are pointed out for the shear-force case, even when using compliant probes. The model can be readily extended to the case of normal oscillation, at least for small amplitudes. Furthermore, it could be applied to a 'mixed' case of shear-force detection performed with very compliant probes.

{"title": "Spatial variations in prostate tissue histology as measured by a tactile resonance sensor.", "abstract": "In recent years, tactile sensors based on piezoelectric resonance sensor technology have been used for medical diagnosis where the sensor's stiffness-measuring properties can reflect tissue pathology. The change in the frequency of the resonating system and the change in force when contact is made with tissue are used as a stiffness parameter. Earlier stiffness measurements of prostate tissue in vitro demonstrate variations related to tissue composition. In this study, measured stiffness from two human prostate specimens was compared to histological composition of prostate tissue below and around the measurement points. Tissue stiffness was measured with the resonance sensor system. Tissue composition was measured at four different depths in the tissue specimen using a microscopic-image-based morphometrical method. With this method, the proportion of tissue types was determined at the points of intersections in a circular grid on the images representing each measurement point. Numerical values were used for weighting the tissue proportions at different depths in the tissue specimen. For an impression depth of 1.0 mm, the sensing depth in this study was estimated to be 3.5-5.5 mm. Stiffness variations due to horizontal tissue variations were investigated by studying the dependence of the size of the circular grid area relative to the contact area of the sensor tip. The sensing area (grid radius) was estimated to be larger than the contact area (contact radius) between the sensor tip and the tissue. Thus, the sensor tip registers spatial variations in prostate tissue histology, both directly below and lateral to the tip itself.

It was demonstrated that both the DMAc-cast and acetone-cast PVDF-HFP membranes vacuum-dried at 60 degrees C were dense but had different crystalline structures. Predominantly alpha and gamma crystalline phases were found in the acetone-cast and DMAc-cast PVDF-HFP membranes, respectively.

{"title": "Piezoelectric control of needle-free transdermal drug delivery.", "abstract": "Transdermal drug delivery occurs primarily through hypodermic needle injections, which cause pain, require a trained administrator, and may contribute to the spread of disease. With the growing number of pharmaceutical therapies requiring transdermal delivery, an effective, safe, and simple needle-free alternative is needed. We present and characterize a needle-free jet injector that employs a piezoelectric actuator to accelerate a micron-scale stream of fluid (40-130 microm diameter) to velocities sufficient for skin penetration and drug delivery (50-160 m/s). Existing jet injectors, powered by compressed springs and gases, are not widely used due to painful injections and poor reliability in skin penetration depth and dose. In contrast, our device offers electronic control of the actuator expansion rate, resulting in direct control of jet velocity and thus the potential for more precise injections. We apply a simple fluid-dynamic model to predict the device response to actuator expansion. Further, we demonstrate that injection parameters including expelled volume, jet pressure, and penetration depth in soft materials vary with actuator expansion rate, but are highly coupled. Finally, we discuss how electronically-controlled jet injectors may enable the decoupling of injection parameters such as penetration depth and dose, improving the reliability of needle-free transdermal drug delivery.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2007-09-22", "authors": ["Jeanne CStachowiak", "Marcio Gvon Muhlen", "Thomas HLi", "LalehJalilian", "Sapun HParekh", "Daniel AFletcher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.08.017"}

Limit of detection in spiked milk and apple juice samples is 10 and 100 fg, respectively. PEMC sensors (2 mm(2)) are prepared by immobilizing a polyclonal antibody specific to SEB, which was exposed to 1 mL of 1% milk and apple juice containing 10 fg-10 ng. Sensor response to 100 fg, 1 pg, and 10 pg of SEB in apple juice resulted in resonance frequency decreases of 113 +/- 18 (n = 4), 308 +/- 24 (n = 4), and 521 +/- 20 (n = 2) Hz, respectively. In milk, 10 fg, 100 fg, 1 pg, and 10 pg of SEB resulted in resonance frequency decreases of 126 +/- 18 (n = 2), 143 +/- 35 (n = 4), 310 +/- 32 (n = 5), and 557 +/- 25 (n = 2) Hz, respectively. Positive detection of SEB in the sample solution was observed within the first 20 min. The responses of the sensor to positive (SEB present, but no antibody on sensor), negative (SEB absent, antibody on sensor), and buffer (SEB absent, antibody on sensor) controls were -17 +/- 10 (n = 3), -9 +/- 5 (n = 3), and -6 +/- 12 (n = 18) Hz, respectively. Positive verification of SEB detection was confirmed by two methods: (1) low-pH buffer release caused increase in resonance frequency, and (2) second antibody binding to SEB attached to sensor that caused further resonance frequency decrease.

Based on the model, the particular attentions are devoted to effects of the boundary conditions at two ends on flexural resonance frequencies of the piezoelectric ceramic tubes. Changing the sizes of the tubes and the mass loads at both free ends, the variations of the flexural resonance frequencies of free-free piezoelectric ceramic tubes are calculated theoretically. Besides, the flexural resonance frequencies of the piezoelectric ceramic tube cantilevers with mass loads at one free end are also investigated theoretically. To verify accuracy of the theoretical mode, the flexural resonance frequencies for different lengths of the piezoelectric ceramic tubes and different loaded masses are measured experimentally.

Clean catch voided urine specimens were prospectively collected from five confirmed prostate cancer patients 3 weeks postbiopsy. The presence of AMACR was measured in a blinded manner by exposing 3 mL of urine to the anti-AMACR-immobilized piezoelectric-excited millimeter-sized (PEMC) sensor. The resonance frequency of PEMC decreases as AMACR from sample binds to the antibody on the sensor. The resonance frequency changes for the five patients tested were 4,314 +/- 35 (n = 2), 269 +/- 17 (n = 2), 977 +/- 64 (n = 3), 600 +/- 31 (n = 2), and 801 +/- 81 (n = 2) Hz, respectively.

The sensor response was quantitatively related to AMACR concentration in control urine, and the relationship was used in developing an in situ calibration method for quantifying AMACR in patient urine. Estimated concentrations of 42, 2, and 3 fg/mL AMACR were calculated for the three patients' urine, while absence of AMACR was confirmed in control urine (n = 13).

Groups of (a) vitrified, (b) vitrified/drilled and (c) fresh control oocytes were fertilised in vitro. The fertilisation rate of vitrified-warmed oocytes was significantly lower than that of fresh oocytes (45.0 +/- 12.6% vs. 85.2 +/- 6.8%, P < 0.05), and was significantly improved by zona-drilling (85.4 +/- 7.3%).

The pulse contour contains valuable information relating to cardiovascular function which may be of clinical use in addition to blood pressure measurements. The aim of this study was to compare the shape of the WEP signal during inflation of the cuff to suprasystolic pressure, with intra-arterial pressure waves, after the administration of vasoactive drugs.\nRadial intra-arterial and suprasystolic WEP waveforms were recorded in 11 healthy men (mean 23 yr) before and at the end of infusion of glyceryl trinitrate, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and salbutamol. Waveform similarity was assessed by comparing the timing and pressure of incident and reflected waves and by root mean square error (RMSE).\nThe WEP signal was found to closely resemble the first derivative of intra-arterial pressure. The WEP signal could be used to derive an arterial pressure wave with minimal bias in the timing of incident [- 8 (18) ms, mean (SD)] and reflected [- 1 (24) ms] waves. Augmentation index was underestimated by WEP [- 7 (18)%]. WEP also provided a measure of compliance which correlated with pulse wave velocity (r = - 0.44).

We recorded the plume structure of four different piezo-sprayer configurations: the sprayer alone; with a 1.6-mm steel mesh shield; with a 3.2-mm steel mesh shield; and with a 5 cm circular upwind baffle. We measured a 12 x 12-mm core at the center of the plume, and both a horizontal and vertical cross-section of the plume, all at 100-, 200-, and 400-mm downwind of the odor source. Significant differences in plume structure were found among all configurations in terms of conditional relative mean concentration, intermittency, ratio of peak concentration to conditional mean concentration, and cross-sectional area of the plume. We then measured the flight responses of the almond moth, Cadra cautella, to odor plumes generated with the sprayer alone, and with the upwind baffle piezo-sprayer configuration, releasing a 13:1 ratio of (9Z,12E)-tetradecadienyl acetate and (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate diluted in ethanol at release rates of 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 pg/min. For each configuration, differences in pheromone release rate resulted in significant differences in the proportions of moths performing oriented flight and landing behaviors. Additionally, there were apparent differences in the moths' behaviors between the two sprayer configurations, although this requires confirmation with further experiments. This study provides evidence that both pheromone concentration and plume structure affect moth orientation behavior and demonstrates that care is needed when setting up experiments that use a piezo-electric release system to ensure the optimal conditions for behavioral observations.", "journal": "Journal of chemical ecology", "date": "2007-09-11", "authors": ["Robbie DGirling", "Ring TCard\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1007/s10886-007-9349-3"}

The device is made entirely of nonferrous materials and consists of four piezoelectric ceramic plates connected to a threaded metal tube through which a screw migrates. Ultrasonic vibrations of the threads inherent to the tube result in rotational and translational motion of the screw. Potential applications of the piezoelectric motor were investigated at 4.7 T. Firstly, phantom studies showed the motor was capable of accurately delivering low injection volumes ( approximately 0.01 ml). Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) studies performed in vivo using serially acquired T1-weighted, spin-echo imaging demonstrated the ability of the motor to reliably administer MR contrast-enhancing agent into live tumor-bearing mice without the introduction of image artifacts. In a second set of experiments, the motor allowed for controlled, dynamic repositioning of an anatomic slice of interest in a live animal to magnetic field isocenter, which resulted in reduced geometric distortion and image artifact due to improved radiofrequency and gradient field homogeneity. In conclusion, piezoelectric motors are MR compatible and offer great potential for improving MRI efficiency and throughput, particularly in a preclinical setting.

{"title": "Superficial topography of wound: a determinant of underlying biological events?", "abstract": "Three-dimensional configuration of wounds varies considerably according to the etiology. Wounding of skin is proceeded by release of dermal pretension. Subsequent disruption of physical equilibrium with resulting development of force vectors alters the primary shape of wound to maintain a new dynamic physical equilibrium. This leads to the development of stress-relaxation and stress-concentration areas throughout the wound milieu. Mechanical strain produces piezoelectric current which is maximal in stress-relaxation regions due to lower tissue stiffness and higher mobility. Early surge in the tissue level of TGF-beta would be exaggerated through synergistic interaction with piezoelectric current in stress-relaxation areas. Subsequently, fibroblasts migrate to these areas due to galvanotaxis. The gradual dissipation of tissue tension, due to irreversible loss of viscous strain, reduces the synergistic action of TGF-beta and piezoelectricity. However, a similar pattern of activity of TGF-beta due to the polarized migration of fibroblasts, which are the main source of TGF-beta during secondary surge, may be continued. It seems that a biological-mechanical continuum exists for wounds so that even the superficial topography of wounds may affect the underlying biological activity and final healing outcome during healing of dermal wounds.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-09-11", "authors": ["Ramin Mostofi ZadehFarahani", "Naser AslAminabadi", "Luther CKloth"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2007.05.056"}

For MRI compatibility the robot is exclusively constructed of nonmagnetic and dielectric materials such as plastics, ceramics, crystals, rubbers and is electricity free. Light-based encoding is used for feedback, so that all electric components are distally located outside the imager's room. MRI robots are modern, digital medical instruments in line with advanced imaging equipment and methods. These allow for accessing patients within closed bore scanners and performing interventions under direct (in scanner) imaging feedback. MRI robots could allow e.g. to biopsy small lesions imaged with cutting edge cancer imaging methods, or precisely deploy localized therapy at cancer foci. Our robot is the first to show the feasibility of fully automated in-scanner interventions. It is customized for the prostate and operates transperineally for needle interventions. It can accommodate various needle drivers for different percutaneous procedures such as biopsy, thermal ablations, or brachytherapy. The first needle driver is customized for fully automated low-dose radiation seed brachytherapy. This paper gives an introduction to the challenges of MRI robot compatibility and presents the solutions adopted in making the MrBot. Its multi-imager compatibility and other preclinical tests are included. The robot shows the technical feasibility of MRI-guided prostate interventions, yet its clinical utility is still to be determined.", "journal": "Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy", "date": "2007-09-01", "authors": ["DanStoianovici", "DannySong", "DoruPetrisor", "DanielUrsu", "DumitruMazilu", "MichaelMuntener", "MichaelSchar", "AlexandruPatriciu"], "doi": "10.1080/13645700701520735"}

It is crucial that the instrument used for maintenance be able to remove plaque and calculus from the implant surface effectively and efficiently, while causing minimal damage to its circumference. Some ultrasonic scalers may be useful for implant maintenance; however, no clinical study has examined this. This study evaluated the treatment of titanium implants with three piezoelectric scalers in vivo.\nFourteen patients underwent implant treatment in which plaque and calculus were removed from the abutment surfaces with ultrasonic scalers. The abutments were treated with scalers with carbon (VS; N = 7), plastic (PS; N = 7), or metallic (ES; N = 7) tips. The abutment surface characteristics were examined after instrumentation using scanning electron microscopy. The amount of plaque remaining and roughness were estimated using a modification of the remaining plaque and calculus score and the modified roughness score, respectively. In addition, the abutment surfaces were imaged with a laser profilometer and a laser scanning electron microscope (SEM).\nThe remaining plaque and calculus scores did not differ significantly among the VS, PS, and ES groups. VS and PS produced a significantly smoother abutment surface than ES. The laser SEM three-dimensional images also demonstrated that VS and PS produced smooth abutment surfaces, whereas ES resulted in damaged surfaces.\nVS and PS produced clean, smooth abutment surfaces.

Collagen fibrils show piezoelectricity, a phenomenon that is used by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to obtain high-resolution images. We applied PFM to image human dentin with 10-nm resolution, and to test the hypothesis that zones of piezoactivity, indicating the presence of collagen fibrils, can be distinguished in dentin. Piezoelectricity was observed by PFM in the dentin intertubular matrix, while the peritubular dentin remained without response. High-resolution imaging of chemically treated intertubular dentin attributed the piezoelectric effect to individual collagen fibrils that differed in the signal strength, depending on the fibril orientation.

{"title": "Effect of membrane character and solution chemistry on microfiltration performance.", "abstract": "To help understand and predict the role of natural organic matter (NOM) in the fouling of low-pressure membranes, experiments were carried out with an apparatus that incorporates automatic backwashing and long filtration runs. Three hollow fibre membranes of varying character were included in the study, and the filtration of two different surface waters was compared. The hydrophilic membrane had greater flux recovery after backwashing than the hydrophobic membranes, but the efficiency of backwashing decreased at extended filtration times. NOM concentration of these waters (7.9 and 9.1mg/L) had little effect on the flux of the membranes at extended filtration times, as backwashing of the membrane restored the flux to similar values regardless of the NOM concentration. The solution pH also had little effect at extended filtration times. The backwashing efficiency of the hydrophilic membrane was dramatically different for the two waters, and the presence of colloid NOM alone could not explain these differences. It is proposed that colloidal NOM forms a filter cake on the surface of the membranes and that small molecular weight organics that have an adsorption peak at 220nm but not 254nm were responsible for \"gluing\" the colloids to the membrane surface. Alum coagulation improved membrane performance in all instances, and this was suggested to be because coagulation reduced the concentration of \"glue\" that holds the organic colloids to the membrane surface.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2007-08-28", "authors": ["S RGray", "C BRitchie", "TTran", "B ABolto", "PGreenwood", "FBusetti", "BAllpike"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2007.08.005"}

The analytical solution for the flexural motion of the piezoelectric bimorph plate energy harvester shows that the output power density increases initially, reaches a maximum, then decreases monotonically with the increasing load impedance, which is normalized by a parameter that is a simple combination of the physical and geometrical parameters of the scavenging structure, the bimorph plate, and the frequency of the ambient vibration, underscoring the importance for the load circuit to have the impedance desirable by the scavenging structure.

We found that the FBG always is broadened by polarizing piezoelectric ceramics, and the FBG widths with SC always are larger than that with OC for the same polarization. Our research shows that there are three critical parameters which determine the FBG: the polarized directions, the filling fraction, and the ratio of the plate thickness to the lattice pitch, respectively.

The equipment consists of two piezoelectric hand-pieces and two insets that are connected to a main unit, which supplies power and has holders for the hand-piece and irrigation fluids. Piezosurgery uses low frequency ultrasonic waves (24.7-29.5 kHz), the applied power can be modulated between 2.8 and 16 W, and the machine is programmed in accordance with the density of the bone cut. The micro-vibrations that are created in the piezoelectric hand-piece cause the inserts to vibrate linearly between 60 and 210 microm and allow a selective cut of mineralized tissues without trauma to soft tissues. The interoperative irrigation cools down the bone surface and make the operating site blood-free.

Stress relaxation is a particular problem in isometric studies of highly distensible vessels and is evident as a time-dependent, secondary decline in force after an abrupt length increase. Because the phasic contraction pattern of lymphatics is exquisitely sensitive to changes in preload, stress relaxation makes stable contraction patterns difficult to achieve and analyze.\nA DMT wire myograph was modified to accommodate an Inchworm piezo stack in series with a standard micrometer drive to permit automated control of vessel caliber/force. The force output of the myograph was digitized and computer algorithms were devised to servo control force by changing vessel diameter.\nThe system was tested on passive lymphatics, passive small veins, and lymphatics exhibiting spontaneous force transients. The software was designed to temporarily disable servo control during a spontaneous force transient. For both active and passive lymphatics, stable preloads were very well maintained, indicating that the system was adequately compensating for stress relaxation.\nThe method works well with isometric rat mesenteric lymphatics without disturbing spontaneous activity.

To develop a profound understanding of the colossal resistance effects induced by external fields, the study of polaron correlations and the resulting collective polaron behavior, i.e., polaron ordering and transition from polaronic transport to metallic transport is essential. We show that static long-range ordering of Jahn-Teller polarons forms a polaron solid which represents a new type of charge and orbital ordered state. The related noncentrosymmetric lattice distortions establish a connection between colossal resistance effects and multiferroic properties, i.e., the coexistence of ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic ordering. Colossal resistance effects due to an electrically induced polaron solid-liquid transition are directly observed in a transmission electron microscope with local electric stimulus applied in situ using a piezo-controlled tip.

This study shows that loads applied to the proximal tibial epiphysis stimulate healing of surgically generated wounds in the tibial diaphysis.\nWound healing is sensitive to mechanical stimulation such as various forms of stress and different magnitudes of strain. Knee loading has been shown to induce anabolic responses to murine tibias and femora when a strain of 10-20 mustrain is applied at the site of new bone formation. The object of this study was to address a question: does knee loading accelerate closure of open wounds in the tibia?\nFifty-three C57/BL/6 female mice were used. A surgical wound (0.5 mm in diameter) was generated in the left tibia (loaded) and the right tibia (sham-loaded control). From the fourth postoperative day, knee loading was performed to the left knee with a custom-made piezoelectric loader for 3 min/d for 3 consecutive days. The peak-to-peak force was 0.5 N. Animals were killed 1, 2, or 3 wk after surgery, and the healing process was evaluated with muCT, pQCT, and bone histomorphometry with calcein labeling.\nThe measured strain was <20 mustrain with 0.5-N force regardless of the presence or absence of surgical wounds. Compared with sham-loaded controls, the results showed load-driven acceleration of wound healing. First, muCT data revealed that knee loading reduced the size of surgical wounds by 13% (p < 0.01; 1 wk), 25% (p < 0.001; 2 wk), and 15% (p < 0.01; 3 wk). Second, pQCT data indicated that total BMD and BMC and cortical BMD and BMC were significantly increased in the third postoperative week. Last, bone histomorphometry revealed that bone formation was stimulated from the site proximal (close to the knee) to the wound.\nThe reparative and remodeling phases of wound healing were enhanced by loads applied to the knee without inducing significant in situ strain at the site of wounds.

{"title": "History of echocardiography and its future applications in medicine.", "abstract": "This review concisely presents the chronology of events that shaped the development of echocardiography. The concept of \"seeing\" structures using \"sound\" dates back to the 1920s, when ultrasound produced by piezoelectric crystals was used to detect flaws in metals. In the early 1950s, Hertz and Edler described the use of ultrasound for assessing mitral-valve disease. Subsequently, Harvey Feigenbaum in the 1960s standardized the clinical use of M-mode echocardiography for quantitative assessment of left-ventricular dimensions. The advent of 2-dimensional echocardiography (1970s), pulsed Doppler (1970s), and color Doppler (1980s) introduced new methods for routine assessment of cardiac anatomy and hemodynamics at bedside. Flexible scopes and superior transducers further paved the way to the application of transesophageal echocardiography. Tissue Doppler and contrast echocardiography recently have emerged as important tools for evaluation of regional myocardial function and blood flow. Miniaturization and the ability to pack thousands of crystals in an electronic array have transformed the application of 3-dimensional echocardiography into a bedside tomographic tool. At the current pace of development, echocardiography will be able to provide complete assessment of the heart in terms of its anatomy, coronary flow, and physiology.

Infants were exposed to white noise from 50 to 100 dB at 10 dB intervals within REM and NREM sleep.\nAwakening thresholds were higher (P = 0.01) in NREM (>90 dB) than REM sleep (mean +/- SD; 74.3 +/- 9.4dB). Subcortical thresholds were always 10 dB below waking thresholds. Following awakening, there was an immediate increase in HR, SBP, and DBP of 21%, 14%, and 17%, respectively, and a 13% decrease in PTT returning to baseline within 25-30 seconds. PTT at baseline measured 140 +/- 11 and 139 +/- 9 msec in NREM and REM sleep, respectively, and decreased approximately 20 msec with waking. PTT changes were negatively correlated with heart rate (HR) but not BP, although a trend was evident.\nAt 3 months of age, infants provoked to arouse from sleep showed PTT changes that inversely mimicked BP trends, suggesting that PTT could be useful in infant studies as a marker for autonomic perturbations that occur during sleep in both clinical and research settings.", "journal": "Sleep", "date": "2007-08-09", "authors": ["Barbara CGalland", "EvanTan", "Barry JTaylor"], "doi": "10.1093/sleep/30.7.891"}

A basic principle is the necessity of mesh-based techniques. The study was performed to evaluate a laparoscopic approach, primarily based on the intraperitoneal on lay mesh technique.\nSixty-six patients with a symptomatic parastomal hernia were enrolled in the prospective study between November 1999 and February 2006. After complete adhesiolysis, the mesh was introduced to cover the fascial defect of the hernia and the original midline incision. In special cases, a two-mesh technique was used. First, an incised mesh was placed around the stoma sling. The second mesh was used to cover the abdominal wall with the first mesh; the stoma sling was placed between the two meshes for at least 5 cm.\nThe two-mesh technique proved to be superior in terms of recurrence rate especially in cases with a lateral fascial defect.\nThe laparoscopic repair of parastomal hernias is a surgically challenging procedure with promising results when using the two-mesh technique. Therefore, two meshes should be used in all cases of parastomal hernias.

{"title": "Adsorption of amylase enzyme on ultrafiltration membranes.", "abstract": "A method to measure the static adsorption on membrane surfaces has been developed and described. The static adsorption of amylase-F has been measured on two different ultrafiltration membranes, both with a cutoff value of 10 kDa (a PES membrane and the ETNA10PP membrane, which is a surface-modified PVDF membrane). The adsorption follows the Langmuir adsorption theory. Thus, the static adsorption consists of monolayer coverage and is expressed both as a permeability drop and an adsorption resistance. From the adsorption isotherms, the maximum static permeability drops and the maximum static adsorption resistances are determined. The maximum static permeability drop for the hydrophobic PES membrane is 75%, and the maximum static adsorption resistance is 0.014 m2.h.bar/L. The maximum static permeability drop for the hydrophilic surface-modified PVDF membrane (ETNA10PP) is 23%, and the maximum static adsorption resistance is 0.0046 m2.h.bar/L. The difference in maximum static adsorption, by a factor of around 3, affects the performance during the filtration of a 5 g/L amylase-F solution at 2 bar. The two membranes behave very similarly during filtration with almost equal fluxes and retentions even though the initial water permeability of the PES membrane is around 3 times larger than the initial water permeability of the ETNA10PP membrane. This is mainly attributed to the larger maximum static adsorption of the PES membrane. The permeability drop during filtration exceeds the maximum static permeability drop, indicating that the buildup layer on the membranes during filtration exceeds monolayer coverage, which is also seen by the increase in fouling resistance during filtration. The accumulated layer on the membrane surface can be described as a continually increasing cake-layer thickness, which is independent of the membrane type. At higher concentrations of enzyme, concentration polarization effects cannot be neglected. Therefore, stagnant film theory and the osmotic pressure model can describe the relationship between flux and bulk concentration.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2007-08-07", "authors": ["S\u00f8ren PripBeier", "Ann DorritEnevoldsen", "Georgios MKontogeorgis", "Ernst BHansen", "GunnarJonsson"], "doi": "10.1021/la701524x"}

This focus is mainly on those connected to mechanical vibrations, assessing the relationships between the mechanical inputs and the deriving effects on the spectra. Mechanical vibrations have two main effects on the spectra, the addition of signals due to direct sensitivity to vibrations of the detectors (e.g., through piezoelectric effect) and the changes of the interferogram due to the interferometer optical components motion. The Fourier transform spectrometer considered in this study is based on the constant optical path step sampling achieved by using the interferogram of a reference laser as a trigger so, ideally insensitive to mirrors speed changes, however, the analysis will show how the effects of delays in the sampling chain can compromise the benefits of this configuration. The effects of the vibration of the interferometer optical alignment are considered as well, showing the effect produced on the interferograms and eventually on the spectra. Despite their nonmechanical nature, detector nonlinearity and internal optical reflections are considered as well because their effects, similar to the mechanical ones, could be confused with the latter while in spectra diagnostic it is often important to be able to distinguish between the two.

This approach is based on the investigation of band gaps, that strongly depend on the properties of the considered composites (geometry, size, nature of materials). It is motivated by the fact that band gaps in principle allow one to excite the thickness mode without exciting other parasitic propagating waves. The used plane-wave-expansion method has already been applied to periodic piezoelectric composites, but, in contrast to previous approaches, not only waves propagating in the symmetry plane of the composite are considered, but also waves propagating with a nonzero angle of incidence with this plane. The method is applied to a representative 1-3 connectivity piezocomposite in order to demonstrate its potentialities for design purposes.

High-intensity [maximum volume of 120 dB (SPL)] or low-intensity [maximum volume of 110 dB (SPL)] clicks were delivered at a frequency of 1 Hz and lasted 1 ms. We first checked that the high-intensity, but not low-intensity, clicks stimulated the sacculus by determining the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. We then analyzed two task conditions (high- and low-intensity clicks) in a boxcar paradigm. We obtained gradient echo echo-planar images by using a 1.5 T MRI system. We analyzed the fMRI time series data with SPM2. High-intensity clicks activated wide areas of the cortex, namely, the frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and frontal eye fields), parietal lobe (the region around the intraparietal sulcus, temporo-parietal junction, and paracentral lobule), and cingulate cortex.

{"title": "New technology for cellular piercing: rotationally oscillating mu-injector, description and validation tests.", "abstract": "ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) procedure is one of the most commonly used cellular-injection processes. In ICSI a drawn glass pipette is pushed against the biological cell and a series of force impulses are exerted on it axially to achieve the piercing through the zona and the membrane in sequence for the ensuing injection. In most advanced applications a piezo actuator creates this impulsive forcing. This procedure presently requires a very small mercury column inside the glass pipette which is found to be helpful especially for minimizing the transverse oscillations. Despite the toxic mercury, the procedure is commonly utilized in many laboratories. Earlier investigations point out that considerable lateral tip oscillations of the injection pipette remain as the piezo-electric pulses are introduced. Such oscillations damage the cell membrane and impart adverse effects on the success rate of the injection. In this study, we introduce a novel microinjection procedure, which will remedy the shortfalls of the present technology. The highlight of this procedure is the introduction of rotational oscillations to the pipette during the drilling. These oscillations of small amplitudes (few degrees) and high enough frequencies (100 Hz and higher) are shown to create very effective piercing.

In this study, we evaluated a new acoustic monitoring system for the detection of OLI.\nLung sounds were collected from 24 adult surgical patients scheduled for routine surgical procedures. Four piezoelectric microphones attached to the patients' backs were used to sample lung sounds during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal tube positioning. To achieve OLI, the endotracheal tube was inserted and advanced down the airway so that diminished or no breath sounds were heard on the left side of the chest. The tube was then withdrawn stepwise until equal breath sounds were heard. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy confirmed the tube's final position. Acoustic analyses were preformed by a new algorithm which assumes a Multiple Input Multiple Output system, in which a multidimensional Auto-Regressive model relates the input (lungs) and the output (recorded sounds) and a classifier, based on a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test, indicates the number of ventilated lungs without reconstructing the original lung sounds from the recorded samples.\nThis algorithm achieved an OLI detection probability of 95.2% with a false alarm probability of 4.8%.\nHigher detection values can be achieved at the price of a higher incidence of false alarms.", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "date": "2007-07-25", "authors": ["STejman-Yarden", "AZlotnik", "LWeizman", "JTabrikian", "ACohen", "NWeksler", "G MGurman"], "doi": "10.1213/01.ane.0000281943.81023.6e"}
{"title": "Electrostatic potential in a bent piezoelectric nanowire. The fundamental theory of nanogenerator and nanopiezotronics.", "abstract": "We have applied the perturbation theory for calculating the piezoelectric potential distribution in a nanowire (NW) as pushed by a lateral force at the tip. The analytical solution given under the first-order approximation produces a result that is within 6% from the full numerically calculated result using the finite element method. The calculation shows that the piezoelectric potential in the NW almost does not depend on the z-coordinate along the NW unless very close to the two ends, meaning that the NW can be approximately taken as a \"parallel plated capacitor\". This is entirely consistent to the model established for nanopiezotronics, in which the potential drop across the nanowire serves as the gate voltage for the piezoelectric field effect transistor. The maximum potential at the surface of the NW is directly proportional to the lateral displacement of the NW and inversely proportional to the cube of its length-to-diameter aspect ratio. The magnitude of piezoelectric potential for a NW of diameter 50 nm and length 600 nm is approximately 0.3 V. This voltage is much larger than the thermal voltage ( approximately 25 mV) and is high enough to drive the metal-semiconductor Schottky diode at the interface between atomic force microscope tip and the ZnO NW, as assumed in our original mechanism for the nanogenerators.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2007-07-25", "authors": ["YifanGao", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1021/nl071310j"}

A metal-coated fibre-tip is used as a sensor and a heterodyne interferometer detects the change in the optical path resulting from the movement of the fibre-tip in the sound field. Spectrally resolved sound field parameters such as the fundamental, the subharmonic or cavitation noise are extracted from the measurements and compared with results obtained by a piezo-electric hydrophone. It was found that the fibre sensor provides a signal related to the velocity in the sound field, but the information about cavitation-related parameters is similar to the information for pressure sensing techniques. The fibre-optic sensors have a uniquely high spatial resolution and the sound detection process is strongly influenced by single cavitation events close to the small fibre-tip. This paper shows that fibre-tip sensors are an alternative to common hydrophone techniques. They can open up new possibilities for measurement problems for which so far no solution exists, in particular when a high spatial resolution is required or when the measurement site is small.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2007-07-24", "authors": ["ChristianKoch", "Klaus-VitoldJenderka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2007.05.007"}

It was found that NOM source plays a primary role in determining the fouling of these membranes. Increase in permeate flux promoted membrane fouling, but to a lesser extent than NOM source. Permeate backwash flux appeared to restore permeability more effectively for the polyether sulfone (PES) membranes than to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes used. NOM characterization revealed that organic colloids contributed predominantly to the hydraulically reversible fouling, and potentially to the irreversible fouling.

{"title": "Transfer functions of US transducers for harmonic imaging and bubble responses.", "abstract": "Current medical diagnostic echo systems are mostly using harmonic imaging. This means that a fundamental frequency (e.g., 2 MHz) is transmitted and the reflected and scattered higher harmonics (e.g., 4 and 6 MHz), produced by nonlinear propagation, are recorded. The signal level of these harmonics is usually low and a well-defined transfer function of the receiving transducer is required. Studying the acoustic response of a single contrast bubble, which has an amplitude in the order of a few Pascal, is another area where an optimal receive transfer function is important. We have developed three methods to determine the absolute transfer function of a transducer. The first is based on a well-defined wave generated by a calibrated source in the far field. The receiving transducer receives the calibrated wave and from this the transfer functions can be calculated. The second and third methods are based on the reciprocity of the transducer. The second utilizes a calibrated hydrophone to measure the transmitted field. In the third method, a pulse is transmitted by the transducer, which impinges on a reflector and is received again by the same transducer. In both methods, the response combined with the transducer impedance and beam profiles enables the calculation of the transfer function. The proposed methods are useful to select the optimal piezoelectric material (PZT, single crystal) for transducers used in reception only, such as in certain 3D scanning designs and superharmonic imaging, and for selected experiments like single bubble behavior. We tested and compared these methods on two unfocused single element transducers, one commercially available (radius 6.35 mm, centre frequency 2.25 MHz) the other custom built (radius 0.75 mm, centre frequency 4.3 MHz).

{"title": "Effect of NOM characteristics and membrane type on microfiltration performance.", "abstract": "Efforts to understand and predict the role of different organic fractions in the fouling of low-pressure membranes are presented. Preliminary experiments with an experimental apparatus that incorporates automatic backwashing and filtration over several days has shown that microfiltration (MF) of the hydrophilic fractions leads to rapid flux decline and the formation of a cake or gel layer, while the hydrophobic fractions show a steady flux decline and no obvious formation of a gel or cake layer. The addition of calcium to the weakly hydrophobic acid (WHA) fraction led to the formation of a gel layer from associations between components of the WHA. The dominant foulants were found to be neutral and charged hydrophilic compounds, with hydrophobic and small pore size membranes being the most readily fouled. The findings suggest that surface analyses such as FTIR will preferentially identify hydrophilic compounds as the main foulants, as these components form a gel layer on the surface while the hydrophobic compounds adsorb within the membrane pores. Furthermore, coagulation pre-treatment is also likely to reduce fouling by reducing pore constriction rather than the formation of a gel layer, as coagulants remove the hydrophobic compounds to a large extent and very little of the hydrophilic neutral components.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2007-07-10", "authors": ["S RGray", "C BRitchie", "TTran", "B ABolto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2007.06.020"}

Cellular adhesion and proliferation was evident on all tested biomaterials except PVA. The cell spheroids on PVA appeared not to be proliferated and remained as well as reattachable to tissue culture plates.

{"title": "Piezo-assisted nuclear transfer affects cloning efficiency and may cause apoptosis.", "abstract": "Even though it generates healthy adults, nuclear transfer in mammals remains an inefficient process. Mainly attributed to abnormal reprograming of the donor chromatin, this inefficiency may also be caused at least partly by a specific effect of the cloning technique which has not yet been well investigated. There are two main procedures for transferring nuclei into enucleated oocytes: fusion and piezoelectric microinjection, the latter being used mostly in mice. We have, therefore, decided to compare the quality and the developmental ability, both in vivo and in vitro, of embryos reconstructed with electrofusion or piezoelectric injection. In addition, the effect of piezo setups of differing electric strengths was investigated. Along with the record of the rate of development, we compared the nuclear integrity in the blastomeres during the first cleavages as well as the morphological and cellular quality of the blastocysts. Our results show that the piezo-assisted micromanipulation can induce DNA damage in the reconstructed embryos, apoptosis, and reduced cell numbers in blastocysts as well as a lower rate of development to term. Even if piezo-driven injection facilitates a faster and more efficient rate of reconstruction, it should be used with precaution and with as low parameters as possible.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2007-07-10", "authors": ["YangYu", "ChenhuiDing", "EryaoWang", "XinjieChen", "XuemeiLi", "ChunliZhao", "YongFan", "LiuWang", "NathalieBeaujean", "QiZhou", "AliceJouneau", "WeizhiJi"], "doi": "10.1530/REP-06-0358"}

Measurements with short sampling times are only achievable with a fixed analyzer position (A=45 degrees ). Therefore the ellipsometer calibration is extremely important for high precision measurements and we propose a spectroscopic calibration (i.e., determination of the azimuth of elements according to the wavelength) on the whole spectral range. A homemade EQCM was developed to detect mass variations attached to the electrode. This additional instrument provides further information useful for ellipsometric data modeling of complex electrochemical systems. The EQCM measures frequency variations of piezoelectric quartz crystal oscillator working at 5 MHz. These frequency variations are linked to mass variations of electrode surface with a precision of 20 ng cm(-2) every 160 ms.

The zonae pellucidae of in vitro matured oocytes were either punctured with 8- to 10-microm square-ended nuclear injection pipettes and piezo pulses or slit with 35- to 40-microm enucleation pipettes. Intact oocytes were used as controls. These oocytes were electroactivated to induce parthenogenesis and transferred to the oviducts of estrus-synchronized recipient gilts. After 5 to 7 days, the recipient uteri were flushed to collect embryos, and embryonic development (morula-blastocyst stage embryos/collected embryos) and survival (viable embryos/collected embryos) were determined. In total, 221 zona-punctured, 129 zona-slitted and 57 intact embryos were transplanted into four, two and two gilts, respectively. The efficiency of embryo recovery was similar in all groups (64.3 to 79.1%). However, the zona-penetrated and incised embryos exhibited unstable development and survival compared with the controls; development and survival of the control embryos were 94.7 and 87.7%, whereas those of the zona-punctured embryos were 69.0 and 47.9% (P<0.01) and those of the zona-slit embryos were 64.7 and 50.0% (P<0.01). Cells with large foci that appeared to be macrophage giant cells were observed at the surface or inside the degenerated zona-damaged embryos.

Currently, the main ejection technologies are piezoelectric and bubble-jet. We adapted two commercial printers, respectively a piezoelectric and a bubble-jet one, for the deposition of immunoglobulins into an ELISA plate. The objective was to perform a comparative evaluation of the two classes of ink-jet technologies in terms of required hardware modifications and possible damage on the dispensed molecules. The hardware of the two printers was modified to dispense an enzyme conjugate solution, containing polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgG labelled with HRP in 7 wells of an ELISA plate. Moreover, the ELISA assay was used to assess the functional activity of the biomolecules after ejection. ELISA is a common and well-assessed technique to detect the presence of particular antigens or antibodies in a sample. We employed an ELISA diagnostic kit for the qualitative screening of anti-ENA antibodies to verify the ability of the dispensed immunoglobulins to bind the primary antibodies in the wells. Experimental tests showed that the dispensing of immunoglobulins using the piezoelectric printer does not cause any detectable difference on the outcome of the ELISA test if compared to manual dispensing using micropipettes.

Measured contact angles of PVDF melt droplets on modified carbon fibers show that short exposure times of carbon fibers to atmospheric-plasma fluorination (corresponding to a degree of surface fluorination of F/C = 0.01 (1.1%)) leads to improved wettability of the fibers by PVDF melts. The apparent interfacial shear strength as a measure of practical adhesion, determined by the single-fiber pullout test, increases by 65% under optimal treatment conditions. The improved practical adhesion is not due to the formation of transcrystalline regions around the fibers or a change of the bulk matrix crystallinity or to an increased surface roughness; it seems to be due to the compatibilization of the interface caused of the atmospheric-plasma fluorination of the carbon fibers.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2007-06-23", "authors": ["Kingsley K CHo", "StevenLamoriniere", "GerhardKalinka", "EckhardSchulz", "AlexanderBismarck"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2007.04.076"}

Both microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were evaluated. In general, flat sheet membranes fouled more rapidly than hollow fiber membranes. Pretreatment such as coagulation generally affected both configurations similarly, but in some cases coagulation reduced fouling on hollow fiber membranes but increased fouling on flat sheet membranes. Prefiltration to remove foulants above 1microm in size had a consistent effect on both configurations. A bench-scale apparatus employing a single-fiber module that allows testing over multiple filter runs with integral backwashing capabilities was demonstrated to provide more detailed information about fouling, which can be applied to full-scale applications.

{"title": "Controlling charge on levitating drops.", "abstract": "Levitation technologies are used in containerless processing of materials, as microscale manipulators and reactors, and in the study of single drops and particles. Presented here is a method for controlling the amount and polarity of charge on a levitating drop. The method uses single-axis acoustic levitation to trap and levitate a single, initially neutral drop with a diameter between 400 microm and 2 mm. This drop is then charged in a controllable manner using discrete packets of charge in the form of charged drops produced by a piezoelectric drop-on-demand dispenser equipped with a charging electrode. The magnitude of the charge on the dispensed drops can be adjusted by varying the voltage applied to the charging electrode. The polarity of the charge on the added drops can be changed allowing removal of charge from the trapped drop (by neutralization) and polarity reversal. The maximum amount of added charge is limited by repulsion of like charges between the drops in the trap. This charging scheme can aid in micromanipulation and the study of charged drops and particles using levitation.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2007-06-22", "authors": ["Ryan THilger", "Michael SWestphall", "Lloyd MSmith"], "doi": "10.1021/ac070413j"}

The results of dopplerography of renal vessels, densitometry of the concrements using spiral and multispiral computed tomography served control for comparison. It is shown that patients of groups 1 and 2 developed persistent impairment of intrarenal hemodynamics manifesting with a considerable rise of systolic and fall of diastolic blood flow velocity, with increased indices of peripheral resistance on day 1 and 5 after ESWL. Severity of intrarenal blood flow disorders should be considered when deciding on further sessions of ESWL. In this case extracorporeal lithotripsy with piezoelectric generation of shock wave is an optimal treatment. Depending on the effect on the intrarenal circulation, the second session in groups 1 and 2 should be performed at least in 5 day interval, in group 3--in 3 days. In large concrements (1.0-2.0 cm in size) with high structural density (801-1500 Hu) further sessions of ESWL must be made and piezolithotripsy is indicated as a low-traumatic method of the concrement fragmentation.

Such moving wavefronts of whisker deflection are likely to be fundamental elements of natural somatosensory input. To determine how moving wavefronts are represented in somatosensory cortex (S1), we measured single- and multiunit neural responses in S1 of anesthetized rats to moving wavefronts applied through a piezoelectric whisker deflector array. Wavefronts consisted of sequential deflections of individual whisker arcs, which moved progressively across the whisker array. Starting position (starting arc), direction, and velocity of wavefronts were varied. Neurons responded strongly only when wavefront starting position included their principal whisker (PW). When wavefronts started at neighboring positions and swept through the PW, responses to the PW arc were suppressed by <or=95%, and responses over the entire wavefront duration were suppressed by <or=60% compared with wavefronts that initiated with the PW. Suppression occurred with interarc deflection delays of >or=5 ms, was maximal at 20 ms, and recovered within 100-200 ms. Suppression of PW arc responses during wavefronts was largely independent of wavefront direction. However, layer 2/3 neurons showed direction selectivity for responses to the entire wavefront (the entire sequence of SW and PW arc deflection). Wavefront direction selectivity was correlated with receptive field somatotopy and reflected differential responses to the specific SWs that were deflected first in a wavefront. These results indicate that suppressive interwhisker interactions shape responses to wavefronts, resulting in increased salience of wavefront starting position, and, in some neurons, preference for wavefront direction.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2007-06-15", "authors": ["Patrick JDrew", "Daniel EFeldman"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.00056.2007"}

It was found that the broadest frequency response with nearly constant beamwidth can be obtained when the two halves of the piezoelectric ring are electromechanically excited 90 deg out-of-phase.

The model integrates the electrical, acoustic, and mechanical elements of the cochlea. In particular, the model includes interactions between structures in the organ of Corti (OoC), piezoelectric relations for outer hair cell (OHC) motility, hair bundle (HB) conductance that changes with HB deflection, current flow in the cross section and along the different scalae, and the feed-forward effect. The parameters in the model are based on guinea-pig data as far as possible. The model is vetted using a variety of experimental data on basilar membrane motion and data on voltages and currents in the OoC. Model predictions compare well, qualitatively and quantitatively, with experimental data on basilar membrane frequency response, impulse response, frequency glides, and scala tympani voltage. The close match of the model predictions with experimental data demonstrates the validity of the model for simulating cochlear response to acoustic input and for testing hypotheses of cochlear function. Analysis of the model and its results indicates that OHC somatic motility is capable of powering active amplification in the cochlea. At the same time, the model supports a possible synergistic role for HB motility in cochlear amplification.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2007-06-07", "authors": ["SripriyaRamamoorthy", "Niranjan VDeo", "KarlGrosh"], "doi": "10.1121/1.2713725"}

To verify the feasibility of the optical method in detecting focused ultrasonic fields, a measurement system was set up that utilized both a scanning laser vibrometer and a membrane hydrophone. Measurements were made in different zones of a focusing transducer, and good results were acquired from the optical interferometry in regions where acoustic waves travel in plane form or spherical form.

The mechanical quality factor, Q(m), and the effective coupling factor, k(eff), determine the frequency band over which high power can be transmitted; k(eff) cannot be greater than the piezoelectric material value, and so a high material coupling factor is a requisite for broadband operation. Stansfield's bandwidth criteria are used to calculate the optimum Q(m) value, Q(opt) approximately 1.2 (1-k(eff)2 1/2/k(eff). The results for the tonpilz projector exhibited k(eff) = 0.730, Q(m) = 1.17 (very near optimal), and a fractional bandwidth of 0.93. For the cylindrical transducer array, k(eff) = 0.867, Q(m) = 0.91 (larger than the optimum value, 0.7), and the bandwidth was 1.16.

In the theoretical modeling, the acoustic resonance in an axisymmetric resonator is studied by the Galerkin method. The resonator is exponentially expanded and the boundary driving is provided by a piston at one end. The pressure wave forms, amplitudes, resonance frequencies, and ratio of pressures at the two ends of the resonator are calculated for various expansion flare constants and driving strengths. These results are partially compared with those generated by shaking the resonator. They are also verified in the experiment, in which an exponentially expanded resonator is connected to a speaker box functioning as the piston. The experiment is further extended to a horn-shaped resonator with a rectangular cross section. The boundary driving in this case is generated by a circular piezoelectric disk, which forms one sidewall of the resonator cavity.

It was demonstrated that at low filter acceleration, below 6.2 m/s2, a high perfusion rate of 25 cm/h induced rapid filter pore clogging within 3 days, whereas increasing the filter acceleration to 25 m/s2 increased filter longevity from 3 to 25 days, for filters with a pore size of 8.5 microm.

Chorionic AmbPAG proteins were purified from foetal cotyledonary tissues (CT) and liquid cotyledonary-carrying proteins (LCP) leaking from damaged cells. Our protocols successfully indicated the usefulness of AmbPAG protein identification, especially from LCP fraction. The AmbPAGs were extracted, precipitated and eluted during DEAE cellulose chromatography. The richest protein fractions were further chromatographed on VVA (Vicia villosa agglutinin affinity column), then characterised by mono- and bi-dimensional electrophoresis, Western blot and N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence. After being transferred to PVDF membranes, three selected VVA-purified AmbPAG isoforms differing in molecular masses and isoelectric points (Ip 4-4.6) were selected for sequencing. One identified N-terminal 25aa sequence of AmbPAG72kDa CT form was identified as completely new (RGSNLTSLPLQNVIDLFYVGNITIG). Two other AmbPAG proteins purified from different sources (74kDa CT and 76kDa LCP forms; RGSNLTIHPLRNIRDIFYVGNITIG) were identical or corresponded to N-terminus of various bovine PAGs (boPAG). The two AmbPAGs (74kDa CT and 76kDa LCP) revealed identical micro-sequence to boPAG7; and were similar mainly to bovine PAG4, -6, -15 and -17 precursors that were identified by full-length sequencing derived from cDNA cloning. The novel sequence of the AmbPAG (72kDa CT) was related to some boPAG and various other ruminant PAG precursors (caprine and ovine).

{"title": "Altered left ventricular-arterial coupling precedes pump dysfunction in early heart failure.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to define alterations in ventricular-arterial (V-A) coupling early in the development of tachycardia-induced heart failure (HF). Although HF is characterized by impaired V-A coupling, the temporal relationship of these derangements to overt left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is unknown. Six anesthetized dogs instrumented with LV manometers and piezoelectric crystals were studied before and after 24 h of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP). V-A coupling was indexed by the ratio between the end-systolic pressure-volume relation slope (endsystolic elastance, E(ES)) and effective arterial elastance (E(A)), and mechanical efficiency by the ratio of stroke work (SW) to pressure-volume area (PVA). After RVP, there was no significant depression of LV function, but E(A) and total peripheral resistance (R(T)) were increased (P < 0.05), indicating increased arterial load. After RVP, E(ES)/E(A) and SW/PVA were maintained during unstressed conditions, but upon changes in load induced by phenylephrine, E(ES)/E(A) declined more precipitously with equivalent increases in R (T) (slope E(ES)/E(A)-R(T) relation -16.7 +/- 4.6 vs -5.8 +/- 4.0 ml/mmHg.min, P < 0.025). Furthermore, after RVP there was significant (P < 0.05) blunting of dobutamine-induced augmentation of E(ES), E(ES)/E(A), and SW/PVA.

{"title": "Integrated endoscope for real-time 3D ultrasound imaging and hyperthermia: feasibility study.", "abstract": "The goal of this research is to determine the feasibility of using a single endoscopic probe for the combined purpose of real-time 3D (RT3D) ultrasound imaging of a target organ and the delivery of ultrasound therapy to facilitate the absorption of compounds for cancer treatment. Recent research in ultrasound therapy has shown that ultrasound-mediated drug delivery improves absorption of treatments for prostate, cervical and esophageal cancer. The ability to combine ultrasound hyperthermia and 3D imaging could improve visualization and targeting of cancerous tissues. In this study, numerical modeling and experimental measurements were developed to determine the feasibility of combined therapy and imaging with a 1 cm diameter endoscopic RT3D probe with 504 transmitters and 252 receive channels. This device operates at 5 MHz and has a 6.3 mm x 6.3 mm aperture to produce real time 3D pyramidal scans of 60-120 degrees incorporating 64 x 64 = 4096 image lines at 30 volumes/sec interleaved with a 3D steerable therapy beam. A finite-element mesh was constructed with over 128,000 elements in LS-DYNA to simulate the induced temperature rise from our transducer with a 3 cm deep focus in tissue. Quarter-symmetry of the transducer was used to reduce mesh size and computation time. Based on intensity values calculated in Field II using the transducer's array geometry, a minimum I(SPTA) of 3.6 W/cm2 is required from our endoscope probe in order to induce a temperature rise of 4 degrees C within five minutes. Experimental measurements of the array's power output capabilities were conducted using a PVDF hydrophone placed 3 cm away from the face of the transducer in a watertank. Using a PDA14 Signatec data acquisition board to capture full volumes of transmitted ultrasound data, it was determined that the probe can presently maintain intensity values up to 2.4 W/cm2 over indefinite times for therapeutic applications combined with intermittent 3D scanning to maintain targeting. These values were acquired using 8 cycle bursts at a prf of 6 kHz. Ex vivo heating experiments of excised pork tissue yielded a maximum temperature rises of 2.3 degrees C over 5 minutes of ultrasound exposure with an average rise of 1.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C over 5 trials.

A gold-coated (2.2 mm2), piezoelectric-excited, millimeter-sized cantilever (PEMC) sensor was exposed to 1-hexadecanethiol (HDT) in ethanol at concentrations ranging from 1 fM to 1 mM, sequentially and separately. A high-order flexural mode at approximately 850 kHz was monitored during the self-assembly. The resonance frequency decreases as a result of increased mass as chemisorption occurs on the surface. We show for the first time that the chemisorption of HDT at 1 fM is readily measurable and gave a response of 220 +/- 13 Hz (n = 4). At higher concentrations (10 and 100 fM; 1, 10, and 100 pM; 1, 10, and 100 nM; 1 microM; and 1 mM), the responses were proportionately, but nonlinearly, higher. At high concentrations (1 mM), the responses to C4, C8, C11, C16, and C18 alkanethiols were linearly proportional and were complete in approximately 25 min. We report for the first time that, once the Au surface is equilibrated at 1 pM, further chemisorption at a lower HDT concentration does not take place, even though over 99% of surface adsorption sites are available. At 1 fM, the overall chemisorption rate did not increase with a 2-fold increase in the HDT flow rate, suggesting that chemisorption at 1 fM is not transport-limited. The measured overall chemisorption rate constant at 1 fM was more rapid than 0.1 min-1.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2007-05-08", "authors": ["KishanRijal", "RajMutharasan"], "doi": "10.1021/la063768r"}

The hearing organ is imaged with a standard laser scanning confocal microscope during sound stimulation. The exact temporal relation between each image pixel and the sound stimulus is quantified.

Previous versions of this acquisition system used a simple search to find pixels with similar phase values. The Fourier series approach permits substantially faster image acquisition with reduced noise levels and improved motion estimation. The system is validated by imaging various vibrating samples attached to a feedback-controlled piezoelectric translator. When using a rigid sample attached to the translator, the system is capable of measuring motion with peak-to-peak amplitudes smaller than 50 nm with an error below 20% at frequencies between 50 and 600 Hz.

Skin pressures at the ankle and on the anterior side of the leg were always highest when tested in all positions. Extension and flexion of the knee joint significantly influenced the skin pressure at the anterior and posterior aspects of the leg, especially when tested in the sitting position with the knee flexed at 90 degrees and in the supine position with the knee flexed at more than 90 degrees (P < 0.001). Plantar flexion of the ankle joint, such as up-heel standing and heel-off walking, significantly increased the skin pressure in the ankle region. Contraction, extension, and relaxation of the calf muscle did not produce large fluctuations in skin pressure when tested in positions with full knee extension.\nBody postures may be one of the most important factors influencing the skin pressure profiles applied by compression stockings.

{"title": "Acoustic field of a ballistic shock wave therapy device.", "abstract": "Shock wave therapy (SWT) refers to the use of focused shock waves for treatment of musculoskeletal indications including plantar fascitis and dystrophic mineralization of tendons and joint capsules. Measurements were made of a SWT device that uses a ballistic source. The ballistic source consists of a handpiece within which compressed air (1-4 bar) is used to fire a projectile that strikes a metal applicator placed on the skin. The projectile generates stress waves in the applicator that transmit as pressure waves into tissue. The acoustic fields from two applicators were measured: one applicator was 15 mm in diameter and the surface slightly convex and the second was 12 mm in diameter the surface was concave. Measurements were made in a water tank and both applicators generated a similar pressure pulse consisting of a rectangular positive phase (4 micros duration and up to 8 MPa peak pressure) followed by a predominantly negative tail (duration of 20 micros and peak negative pressure of -6 MPa), with many oscillations. The rise times of the waveforms were around 1 micros and were shown to be too long for the pulses to be considered shock waves. Measurements of the field indicated that region of high pressure was restricted to the near-field (20-40 mm) of the source and was consistent with the Rayleigh distance. The measured acoustic field did not display focusing supported by calculations, which demonstrated that the radius of curvature of the concave surface was too large to effect a focusing gain. Other SWT devices use electrohydraulic, electromagnetic and piezoelectric sources that do result in focused shock waves. This difference in the acoustic fields means there is potentially a significant mechanistic difference between a ballistic source and other SWT devices.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2007-05-01", "authors": ["Robin OCleveland", "Parag VChitnis", "Scott RMcClure"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2007.02.014"}

Consequently, we are able to monitor the frequency dependence of the orientation of the principal dielectric axes in this plane.

The newly established immunostaining method, Eastern blotting, was applied for the determination of ginsenosides possessing protopanaxadiol and/or protopanaxatriol in the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

Compression and surface potential versus area per molecule isotherms as well as ellipsometry and BAM measurements showed that molecules were aggregated in all Langmuir films before compression. The area per molecule in the absence of aggregation was determined by linear extrapolation of the area at the zero surface pressure to infinite adduct dilution. Comparison of the extrapolated and theoretically calculated areas, being dependent on the composition of the subphase solution, indicated that dyads were oriented with their porphyrin macrocycles in plane of the air-solution interface. Calculated by molecular modeling thickness of the Langmuir films was in accord with that determined by ellipsometry. The Langmuir films were transferred, by using the LB technique, onto different solid substrates for spectroscopic, microscopic, electroanalytical, and photochemical characterization. From the IR spectroscopy investigations it followed that the porphyrin macrocycle of the dyad was either nearly parallel or tilted with respect to the substrate plane. Molecularly modeled pseudo-hexagonal packing and thickness of the LB films were in accord with that imaged by STM and determined by ellipsometry, respectively. The electrochemical redox states of the dyads were established by performing simultaneous cyclic voltammetry and piezoelectric microgravimetry measurements of the LB films on Au-quartz electrodes. Both steady-state and time-resolved emission studies of the zinc porphyrin-fullerene LB films revealed efficient quenching of the singlet-excited Zn porphyrin.

To transform the effective acoustic impedance of the substrate to a near zero value, the Bragg reflectors are composed of alternating high and low acoustic impedance layers of quarter-wavelength thickness. This paper presents the influence of Bragg reflector surface roughness on the resonance characteristics of an SMR. Originally, an A1N/A1 multilayer is used as the Bragg reflector. The poor surface roughness of this Bragg reflector results in a poor SMR frequency response. To improve the surface roughness of Bragg reflectors, a molybdenum (Mo)/titanium (Ti) multilayer with a similar coefficient of thermal expansion is adopted.

Two antisense peptides, both corresponding to the N-terminal fragment 1-14 of rhIFN-beta, were used in this study. Antisense peptide AS-1 was the original antisense peptide and AS-2 was the modified antisense peptide based on the antisense peptide degeneracy. Both antisense peptides were immobilized on the gold electrodes of piezoelectric crystals, respectively, via a self-assembling monolayer of 1,2-ethanedithiol. The binding affinity between rhIFN-beta and each immobilized antisense peptide in solution was evaluated using a quartz crystal microbalance-flow injection analysis (QCM-FIA) system.

{"title": "Pressure-induced phase transitions in PbTiO3: a query for the polarization rotation theory.", "abstract": "Our first-principles computations show that the ground state of PbTiO3 under hydrostatic pressure transforms discontinuously from P4mm to R3c at 9 GPa. Spontaneous polarization decreases with increasing pressure so that the R3c phase transforms to the centrosymmetric Rc phase at around 27 GPa. The first-order phase transition between the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases is exceptional since there is no evidence for a bridging phase. The essential feature of the R3c and Rc phases is that they allow the oxygen octahedron to increase its volume VB at the expense of the cuboctahedral volume VA around a Pb ion. This is further supported by the fact that neither the R3m nor Cm phase, which keep the VA/VB ratio constant, is a ground state within the pressure range between 0 and 40 GPa. Thus, tetragonal strain is dominant up to 9 GPa, whereas at higher pressures, efficient compression through oxygen octahedra tilting plays the central role for PbTiO3. Previously predicted pressure induced colossal enhancement of piezoelectricity in PbTiO3 corresponds to unstable Cm and R3m phases. This suggests that the phase instability, in contrast to the polarization rotation, is responsible for the large piezoelectric properties observed in systems like Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Here, we describe the calibration of a microfluid jet produced by a device that was designed to excite individual cochlear hair cell bundles or cupulae of the fish superficial lateral line system. The calibration involves a precise definition of the linearity and time- and frequency-dependent characteristics of the fluid jet as produced by a pressurized fluid-filled container combined with a glass pipette having a microscopically sized tip acting as an orifice. A procedure is described that can be applied during experiments to obtain a fluid jet's frequency response, which may vary with each individual glass pipette. At small orifice diameters (<15 mum), the fluid velocity of the jet is proportional to the displacement of the piezoelectric actuator pressurizing the container's volume and is suitable to stimulate the hair bundles of sensory hair cells. With increasing diameter, the fluid jet velocity becomes proportional to the actuator's velocity. The experimentally observed characteristics can be described adequately by a dynamical model of damped fluid masses coupled by elastic components.", "journal": "Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology : JARO", "date": "2007-03-28", "authors": ["TheoDinklo", "C\u00e9cil J WMeulenberg", "Sietse Mvan Netten"], "doi": "10.1007/s10162-007-0080-0\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2188-06.2006\n10.1016/0378-5955(92)90062-R\n10.1016/0378-5955(83)90060-6\n10.1098/rspb.1997.0087\n10.1016/0378-5955(86)90178-4\n10.1016/0896-6273(88)90139-0\n10.1073/pnas.84.9.3064\n10.1073/pnas.97.22.11765\n10.1073/pnas.90.4.1330\n10.1038/nn1089\n10.1038/nature03367\n10.1098/rspb.1992.0102\n10.1121/1.400512\n10.1016/S0301-4622(97)00006-9\n10.1007/s00422-005-0032-x\n10.1098/rspb.2000.1230\n10.1073/pnas.2632626100\n10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80455-9\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1127-05.2005\n10.1098/rspb.1992.0152\n10.1121/1.398612\n10.1016/0378-5955(84)90221-1\n10.1152/jn.00893.2002"}

Even though silicon-based microcantilever sensors are sensitive and label-free, they are not suitable for in-liquid detection. More recently lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin-film-based microcantilevers are shown to be sensitive and in situ. However, they require microfabrication and must be electrically insulated. In this study, we show that highly sensitive, in situ, Salmonella typhimurium detection can be achieved at 90% relative humidity using a lead zirconate titanate (PZT)/gold-coated glass cantilever 0.7 mm long with a non-piezoelectric 2.7 mm long gold-coated glass tip by partially dipping the gold-coated glass tip in the suspension at any depth without electrically insulating the PZT. In particular, we showed that at 90% relative humidity and with a dipping depth larger than 0.8mm the PZT/gold-coated glass cantilever showed virtually no background resonance frequency up-shift due to water evaporation and exhibited a mass detection sensitivity of Deltam/Deltaf=-5 x 10(-11)g/Hz.

{"title": "Force measurement and mechanical characterization of living Drosophila embryos for human medical study.", "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to investigate and characterize the force behaviour and mechanical properties of living Drosophila embryos using an in situ polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric microforce-sensing tool with a resolution in the range of sub-micro newtons. The Drosophila embryo is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, medical research, genetics, and developmental biology and has implications in the cure of human diseases. It is also used to study the wiring of the human brain and the nervous system. For a highly efficient and accurate microinjection of genetic material into a Drosophila embryo, it is absolutely necessary to allow close monitoring of the magnitude and direction of microinjection and other biomanipulation forces acting on the embryo during the injection process. In this paper, a networked microrobotic biomanipulation platform integrating a two-axis (two-dimensional) PVDF microforce-sensing tool is used to implement force sensing and injection of living Drosophila embryos. Based on the event synchronization for the feedback of injection video and microforce, the developed networked microrobotic platform can greatly advance operations in microinjection and biomanipulation. Through experiments, quantitative relationships between the applied force and membrane structural deformation of embryos in different stages of embryogenesis and their microinjection force behaviours were investigated. Ultimately, the technology will provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated biomanipulation for batch injection of living embryos in genetic and developmental studies, which will facilitate the development of medicine for the cure of human diseases.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

However, this approach may seriously disrupt cell membranes and cause lethal damage when cells are exposed to the inertial cavitation field. In this study, instead of using sonoporation, ultrasound standing wave fields (USWF) were explored for nonviral transfection of suspension cells. Acoustic resonance in a tubular chamber was generated from the interference of waves emitted from a piezoelectric transducer and consequently reflected from a borosilicate glass coverslip. The suspended K562 erythroleukemia cells were transfected by polyethyleneimine (PEI)/DNA complexes with and without exposure to 1-MHz USWF for 5 min. During USWF exposure, K562 cells moved to the pressure nodal planes first and formed cell bands by the primary radiation force. Nanometer-sized PEI/DNA complexes, circulated between nodal planes by acoustic microstreaming, then used the cell agglomerates as the nucleating sites on which to attach. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h, the efficiency of nonviral transfection based on EGFP transgene expression was determined by fluorescent microscopy and fluorometry. Both studies showed that USWF brought suspended K562 cells and PEI/DNA complexes into close contact at the pressure nodal planes, yielding an approximately 10-fold increment of EGFP transgene expression compared with the group without ultrasonic treatment.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2007-03-27", "authors": ["Yu-HsiangLee", "Ching-AnPeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.10.015"}
{"title": "Lens-focused transducer modeling using an extended KLM model.", "abstract": "The goal of this work was to develop an extended ultrasound transducer model that would optimize the trade-off between accuracy of the calculation and computational time. The derivations are presented for a generalized transducer model, that is center frequency, pulse duration and physical dimensions are all normalized. The paper presents a computationally efficient model for lens-focused, circular (axisymmetric) single element piezoelectric ultrasound transducer. Specifically, the goal of the model is to determine the lens effect on the electro-acoustic response, both on focusing and on matching acoustic properties. The effective focal distance depends on the lens geometry and refraction index, but also on the near field limit, i.e. wavelength and source radius, and on the spectrum bandwidth of the ultrasound source. The broadband (80%) source generated by the transducer was therefore considered in this work. A new model based on a longitudinal-wave assumption is presented and the error introduced by this assumption is discussed in terms of its maximum value (16%) and mean value (5.9%). The simplified model was based on an extension of the classical KLM model for transducer structures and on the related assumptions. The validity of the implemented extended KLM model was evaluated by comparison with finite element modeling, itself previously validated analytically for the one-dimensional planar geometry considered. The pressure field was then propagated using the adequate formulation of the Rayleigh integral for both the extended KLM and finite element results. The simplified approach based on the KLM model delivered the focused response with good accuracy, and hundred-fold lower calculation time in comparison with a mode comprehensive FEM method. The trade-off between precision and time thus becomes compatible with an iterative procedure, used here for the optimization of the acoustic impedance of the lens for the chosen configuration. An experimental comparison was performed and found to be in good agreement with such an extension of the KLM model. The experiments confirm the accuracy of such a model in a validity domain up to -12 dB on the pulse-echo voltage within a relative error of 9% between experiment and modeling. This extended KLM model can advantageously be used for other transducer geometries satisfying the assumption of a predominantly longitudinal vibration or in an optimization procedure involving an adequate criteria for a particular application.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2007-03-27", "authors": ["PierreMar\u00e9chal", "FranckLevassort", "Louis-PascalTran-Huu-Hue", "MarcLethiecq"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2007.01.006"}

By the end of the sixth session, the stones incarcerated were fragmented and the debris in the intrahepatic bile duct was completely eliminated.

Oral surgeons have started using this newly developed ultrasonic bone scalpel when performing precise osteotomies. This technique is known as piezosurgery also and has found wide applications in dental and medical specialities. Numerous protocols including conventional diamond round bur, safe scraper, rongeur pliers and gouge shaped bone chisel have been proposed to simplify osteotomy and osteoplasty in bone surgery before this technique was created. But only ultrasonic osteotomy could reach high levels of precision and safety as compared to those instruments. Ultrasonic osteotomy device is characterized by piezoelectric ultrasonic vibrations of a frequency of 25-29 kHz and a range between 60-200 microm. Due to low-frequency ultrasonic vibration, the device precisely cuts bone without cutting soft tissue even in case of accidental contact. It also maintains a blood-free site during cutting bone. This technique was first used in sinus floor elevation for bony window osteotomy and sinus membrane elevation. After several years, this technique is utilized in more and more dental indications such as ridge expansion, maxillary sinus floor elevation, harvesting of bone graft, extraction and socket debridement for the installation of immediate-loaded implants, extraction of third molars, periodontal surgery, cyst exeresis and inferior alveolar nerve transposition.

This part feeder consists mainly of a horizontal platform vibrated by a pair of parallel piezoelectric bimorph beams. Owing to intermittent impacts with the platform, the transported part on the platform is able to march forward from one end to another. Dynamic modeling of the feeder is accomplished by essentially using the Rayleigh-Ritz decomposition method. The process of modeling first incorporates material properties and constitutive equations of the piezoelectric materials, and then captures the complex dynamics of the parallel-beam piezo-feeder by three low-order assumed-modes in the transverse direction of the vibrating beams. Applying Lagrange's equations on the kinetic and strain energies formulated in terms of generalized coordinates associated with the first three modes, the system dynamics is then represented by three coupled discrete equations of motion. Based on these equations, motions of the platform can be obtained. With platform motion in hand, the intermittent impacts between the parts and the platform are modeled, rendering the marching speed of the part. Numerical simulations are conducted along with the experiments. The closeness found between the theoretical predicted transporting speed of the part and the experimental counterparts verify the effectiveness of the models established.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2007-03-23", "authors": ["Paul C-PChao", "Chien-YuShen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2007.02.002"}

A slider placed atop two vibrating guide rails is levitated by an acoustic radiation force emitted from the rails. A flexural traveling wave propagating along the guide rails allows noncontact transportation of the slider. Permitting a transport mechanism that reduces abrasion and dust generation with an inexpensive and simple structure. The profile of the sliding table was designed using the finite-element analysis (FEA) for high levitation and transportation efficiency. The prototype sliding table was made of alumina ceramic (Al2O3) to increase machining accuracy and rigidity using a structure composed of a pair of guide rails with a triangular cross section and piezoelectric transducers. Two types of transducers were used: bolt-clamped Langevin transducers and bimorph transducers. A 40-mm long slider was designed to fit atop the two rail guides. Flexural standing waves and torsional standing waves were observed along the guide rails at resonance, and the levitation of the slider was obtained using the flexural mode even while the levitation distance was less than 10 microm. The levitation distance of the slider was measured while increasing the slider's weight. The levitation pressure, rigidity, and vertical displacement amplitude of the levitating slider thus were measured to be 6.7 kN/m2, 3.0 kN/microm/m2, and less than 1 microm, respectively.

The pulse techniques of dipolar-filter and T(1rho)-filter allow selective observation of the amorphous and crystalline domains, respectively. The temperature dependence of T(1rho) (F) revealed that the segmental motion in the amorphous domain becomes vigorous above ca 80 degrees C, which is well above the glass transition (T(g)) temperature (52 degrees C) and more close to the beta-relaxation temperature (95 degrees C). On the other hand, vigorous molecular motions in the crystalline domain occur above 120 degrees C, which is much below the melting temperature (212 degrees C). This indicates that the polymer chains in the PCTFE crystallites are more mobile than those of typical semicrystalline fluoropolymers like poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), which can be associated with structural imperfections in the crystallites.

Patients with thinner plantar fascia experienced less pain after treatment; high-intensity treatment and regular exercise were associated with lower pain level. The overall success rates were 63% and 60% at the 3- and 6-month followups. High- and low-intensity treatments were associated with similar improvements in pain and function.

The release of these structures is commonly accomplished by etching and destroying the templates. The 1D nanostructures and microstructures tend to condense because of the occurrence of capillary forces during drying of the specimens. It is shown that highly ordered arrays of polymer microfibers can be easily detached from silanized porous templates by mechanical lift-off. This procedure leaves the templates intact, thus allowing their recycling, and does not involve the use of solutions or solvents, thus circumventing condensation. Therefore, mechanical lift-off may enable the up-scaling of template-based approaches to the fabrication of highly ordered assemblies of 1D nanostructures and microstructures.", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2007-03-14", "authors": ["SilkoGrimm", "KathrinSchwirn", "PetraG\u00f6ring", "HeikoKnoll", "Paul TMiclea", "AndreasGreiner", "Joachim HWendorff", "Ralf BWehrspohn", "UlrichG\u00f6sele", "MartinSteinhart"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.200600544"}

{"title": "Production of cloned mice and ES cells from adult somatic cells by nuclear transfer: how to improve cloning efficiency?", "abstract": "Although it has now been 10 years since the first cloned mammals were generated from somatic cells using nuclear transfer (NT), most cloned embryos usually undergo developmental arrest prior to or soon after implantation, and the success rate for producing live offspring by cloning remains below 5%. The low success rate is believed to be associated with epigenetic errors, including abnormal DNA hypermethylation, but the mechanism of \"reprogramming\" is unclear. We have been able to develop a stable NT method in the mouse in which donor nuclei are directly injected into the oocyte using a piezo-actuated micromanipulator. Especially in the mouse, only a few laboratories can make clones from adult somatic cells, and cloned mice are never successfully produced from most mouse strains. However, this technique promises to be an important tool for future research in basic biology. For example, NT can be used to generate embryonic stem (NT-ES) cell lines from a patient's own somatic cells. We have shown that NT-ES cells are equivalent to ES cells derived from fertilized embryos and that they can be generated relatively easily from a variety of mouse genotypes and cell types of both sexes, even though it may be more difficult to generate clones directly. In general, NT-ES cell techniques are expected to be applied to regenerative medicine; however, this technique can also be applied to the preservation of genetic resources of mouse strain instead of embryos, oocytes and spermatozoa.

Considering the reflection of classical Rayleigh waves in an isotropic half-space at oblique incidence by long topographic irregularities of small thickness, such as projections and grooves, it was found by a perturbation method that, independently from the shape of the irregularities, the reflection coefficient is equal to zero for some angle of incidence. The problem was never treated more accurately than by the first order perturbation method using the thickness/wavelength ratio as a small perturbation parameter. In this work, the impedance method is used for a correct investigation of the problem in the case of periodic projections. A strong dependence of the angle on the thickness/wavelength ratio is observed, if this parameter is more than 0.03. Moreover, a second such angle appears and both angles become closer and disappear for thick projections.

This modal-shaped electrode, based on the orthogonal property of structural vibration modes, is characterized by full modal filtering to ensure that only the desired vibration mode is excited during operation. The newly developed piezoelectric transformer is comprised of three layers: a multilayered input layer, an insulation layer, and a single output layer. The electrode shape of the input layer is derived from its structural vibration modal shape, which takes advantage of the orthogonal property of the vibration modes to achieve a full modal filtering effect. The insulation layer possesses two functions: first, to couple the mechanical vibration energy between the input and output, and second, to provide electrical insulation between the two layers. To meet the two functions, a low temperature, co-fired ceramic (LTCC) was used to provide the high mechanical rigidity and high electrical insulation. It can be shown that this newly developed piezoelectric transformer has the advantage of possessing a more efficient energy transfer and a wider optimal working frequency range when compared to traditional piezoelectric transformers.

The double-dynamic Taguchi method, which permits optimization of several control factors concurrently, is particularly suitable for optimizing the performance of a positioning device with multiple actuators. In this study, matrix experiments were conducted with L9(3(4)) orthogonal arrays (OAs). The two most critical processes for the optimization of positioning device are the identification of the nonlinear ideal function and the combination of the double-dynamic signal factors for the ideal function's response. The driving voltage of the VCM and the waveform amplitude of the PZT actuator are combined into a single quality characteristic to evaluate the positioning response.

{"title": "Spatial distributions of copper in microbial biofilms by scanning electrochemical microscopy.", "abstract": "The spatial distribution of Cu was determined in Escherichia coli PHL628 biofilms using a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) consisting of a microelectrode in conjunction with a piezoelectric micropositioning system. Aqueous labile copper species were determined using voltametric stripping after reductive deposition of Cu for 4 min on the microelectrode at -0.7 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The position of the bulk solution-biofilm interface was determined from the change in current produced by 0.4 mM hydroxymethyl ferrocene that was added as a redox indicator. After a 2 h exposure to 0.2 mM copper, Cu was located in the upper region of the biofilm with a penetration depth less than 150 microm. A one-dimensional diffusive transport model adequately described the spatial distribution of copper in the biofilm, but the Cu retardation factor in the biofilm was more than 6-fold larger than that calculated from the isotherm for Cu binding to suspensions of E. coli PHL628 cells. There are several possible reasons for this difference, including an increase in the amount of extracellular polymer per cell within the biofilm and/or tortuosity that might hinder Cu transport into biofilms. The SECM technique in combination with model calculations provides direct evidence in support of the concept that formation of a biofilm may confer resistance to transient spikes in the bulk solution concentration of toxic metal species by retarding metal diffusion and reducing the metal exposure of cells within the biofilm.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2007-03-03", "authors": ["ZhiqiangHu", "JingJin", "H\u00e9ctor DAbru\u00f1a", "Paul LHouston", "Anthony GHay", "William CGhiorse", "Michael LShuler", "GabrielaHidalgo", "Leonard WLion"], "doi": "10.1021/es061293k"}

Two different approaches were used to attach a genetically altered receptor to the gold electrode on the quartz surface: (1) the mutant receptor containing a single solvent-exposed cysteine was directly attached to the crystal via a sulfur to gold covalent bond, forming a self-assembled protein monolayer, and (2) the N-terminal histidine-tagged end was utilized to attach the receptor via a 3,3-dithiobis[N-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)propionamide-N',N'-diacetic acid] linker complexed with nickel. Previous studies have shown that these engineered constructs bind 17beta-estradiol and are fully functional. Exposure of the receptor directly attached to the piezoelectric crystal to the known ligand 17beta-estradiol resulted in a measurable frequency response, consistent with a change in conformation of the receptor with ligand binding. However, no response was observed when the receptor immobilized via the linker was exposed to the same ligand. The presence of the linker between the quartz surface and the protein receptor does not allow the crystal to sense the conformational change in the receptor that occurs with ligand binding. These results illustrate that the immobilization strategy used to bind the receptor to the sensor platform is key to eliciting an appropriate response from this biosensor.

These methods are also effective in holographic moir\u00e9 where incorporating two piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) yields two orthogonal displacement components simultaneously. Typically, when these methods are used, the first step involves estimating the phase steps pixelwise; then the interference phase distribution is computed by designing a Vandermonde system of equations. In this context, we present a statistical study of these methods for the case of single and dual PZTs. The performance of these methods is also compared with other conventional benchmarking algorithms involving the single PZT. The paper also discusses the significant issue of an allowable pair of phase steps in the presence of noise using a robust statistical tool such as the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. Furthermore, experimental validations of these high-resolution methods are presented for the estimation of single phase in holographic interferometry and for the estimation of multiple phases in holographic moir\u00e9.", "journal": "Journal of the Optical Society of America.

{"title": "Response properties of primary afferents supplying Eimer's organ.", "abstract": "The mole's nose is covered with mechanosensory structures called Eimer's organs. Each organ contains Merkel cell-neurite complexes, Paciniform corpuscles and intraepidermal free nerve endings. The function of Eimer's organ has been the subject of speculation since the 1800s, but responses from the afferents have never been investigated. Our goal was to explore the function of Eimer's organ by recording primary afferent responses to a range of mechanosensory stimuli. Unit activity from the trigeminal ganglion was recorded from coast (Scapanus orarius) and star-nosed (Condylura cristata) moles, while stimulating the nose with a Chubbuck mechanosensory stimulator, a piezo-electric sweeping stimulator, and hand-held probes. Stimuli included static indentations, sinusoidal displacements, different indentation velocities, displacement amplitudes, and directional stimuli across the skin. Receptive fields were small, sometimes restricted to single Eimer's organs. Responses were consistent with a slowly adapting Merkel cell-neurite complex-like receptor class and a dynamically sensitive Pacinian-like rapidly adapting class. A second rapidly adapting class was hypothesized to represent activity of prominent free nerve endings within a central cell column. Some receptors were most sensitive to stimuli applied in particular directions across the skin. Most receptors relayed mechanosensory input with high temporal fidelity. In addition some receptors were tuned to respond best when stimulated at a velocity matching the velocity of the nose during foraging. These results support the hypothesis that Eimer's organ functions to detect small surface features and textures by encoding and integrating deflection information for multiple Eimer's organs during brief touches.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2007-02-14", "authors": ["Paul DMarasco", "Kenneth CCatania"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.02690"}

Using metabolic engineering approaches, PHA structures and contents can be manipulated to achieve controllable monomer and PHA cellular contents. This paper focuses on metabolic engineering methods to produce PHA consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoates (3HA) in recombinant microbial systems. This type of copolyester has mechanical and thermal properties similar to conventional plastics such as poly(propylene) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). In addition, pathways containing engineered PHA synthases have proven to be useful for enhanced PHA production with adjustable PHA monomers and contents.

Mechanical forces that mimic muscle forces were experimentally applied to a piezoelectric generator to verify the accuracy of the simulations and to explore losses due to mechanical coupling.

{"title": "Pattern recognition of sleep in rodents using piezoelectric signals generated by gross body movements.", "abstract": "Current research on sleep using experimental animals is limited by the expense and time-consuming nature of traditional EEG/EMG recordings. We present here an alternative, noninvasive approach utilizing piezoelectric films configured as highly sensitive motion detectors. These film strips attached to the floor of the rodent cage produce an electrical output in direct proportion to the distortion of the material. During sleep, movement associated with breathing is the predominant gross body movement and, thus, output from the piezoelectric transducer provided an accurate respiratory trace during sleep. During wake, respiratory movements are masked by other motor activities. An automatic pattern recognition system was developed to identify periods of sleep and wake using the piezoelectric generated signal. Due to the complex and highly variable waveforms that result from subtle postural adjustments in the animals, traditional signal analysis techniques were not sufficient for accurate classification of sleep versus wake. Therefore, a novel pattern recognition algorithm was developed that successfully distinguished sleep from wake in approximately 95% of all epochs. This algorithm may have general utility for a variety of signals in biomedical and engineering applications. This automated system for monitoring sleep is noninvasive, inexpensive, and may be useful for large-scale sleep studies including genetic approaches towards understanding sleep and sleep disorders, and the rapid screening of the efficacy of sleep or wake promoting drugs.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2007-02-07", "authors": ["Aaron EFlores", "Judith EFlores", "HrishikeshDeshpande", "Jorge APicazo", "Xinmin SimonXie", "PaulFranken", "H CraigHeller", "Dennis AGrahn", "Bruce FO'Hara"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2006.886938"}

Coatings can be formed on a variety of surfaces, delaminated to generate stand-alone membranes or formulated as reactive inks for piezoelectric deposition of viable microbes. As the latex emulsion dries, cell preservation by partial desiccation occurs simultaneously with the formation of pores and adhesion to the substrate. The result is living cells permanently entrapped, surrounded by nanopores generated by partially coalesced polymer particles. Nanoporosity is essential for preserving microbial viability and coating reactivity. Cryo-SEM methods have been developed to visualize hydrated coating microstructure, confocal microscopy and dispersible coating methods have been developed to quantify the activity of the entrapped cells, and FTIR methods are being developed to determine the structure of vitrified biomolecules within and surrounding the cells in dry coatings. Coating microstructure, stability and reactivity are investigated using small patch or strip coatings where bacteria are concentrated 102- to 103-fold in 5-75 microm thick layers with pores formed by carbohydrate porogens. The carbohydrate porogens also function as osmoprotectants and are postulated to preserve microbial viability by formation of glasses inside the microbes during coat drying; however, the molecular mechanism of cell preservation by latex coatings is not known. Emerging applications include coatings for multistep oxidations, photoreactive coatings, stabilization of hyperthermophiles, environmental biosensors, microbial fuel cells, as reaction zones in microfluidic devices, or as very high intensity (>100 g.L-1 coating volume.h-1) industrial or environmental biocatalysts.

Single collagen fibrils, the basic components of the collagen fiber, have a characteristic highly organized structure.

In this study, we determined the Young's modulus of single collagen fibrils at ambient conditions from bending tests after depositing the fibrils on a poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) substrate containing micro-channels. Force-indentation relationships of freely suspended collagen fibrils were determined by loading them with a tip-less cantilever. From the deflection-piezo displacement curve, force-indentation curves could be deduced. With the assumption that the behavior of collagen fibrils can be described by the linear elastic theory of isotropic materials and that the fibrils are freely supported at the rims, a Young's modulus of 5.4 +/- 1.2 GPa was determined. After cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, the Young's modulus of a single fibril increases to 14.7 +/- 2.7 GPa.

Antibody (anti-BA) specific to BA spores was immobilized on the sensing area and exposed to various samples of BA, BT, and BC containing the same concentration of BA at 333 spores/mL, and the concentration of BT + BC was varied in concentration ratios of (BA:BT + BC) 0:1, 1:0, 1:1, 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000. In each case, the sensor responded with an exponential decrease in resonant frequency and the steady-state frequency changes reached were 14 +/- 31 (n = 11), 2742 +/- 38 (n = 3), 3053 +/- 19 (n = 2), 2777 +/- 26 (n = 2), 2953 +/- 24 (n = 2), and 3105 +/- 27 (n = 2) Hz, respectively, in 0, 27, 45, 63, 154, and 219 min. The bound BA spores were released in each experiment, and the sensor response was nearly identical to the frequency change during attachment. These results suggest that the transport of BA spores to the antibody immobilized surface was hindered by the presence of other Bacillus species. The observed binding rate constant, based on the Langmuir kinetic model, was determined to be 0.15 min-1.

The hybrid material was characterized by the UV-vis spectroscopy, the SEM and TEM measurements. The frequency and electrochemical impedance responses characteristics for the processes of immobilization and immunoreaction of anchored anti-AFP antibodies were studied in detail. The immunoresponse of the proposed immunosensor was compared with those antibodies immobilized by using HA or GNP alone. It was found that the developed sensing interface has some advantages such as the activation-free immobilization and the high antigen-binding activities of antibodies. The as-prepared immunosensor can allow for the determination of AFP in the concentration range of 15.3-600.0ngml(-1). Such an interface design with the nano-sized hybrid materials should be tailored as a new alternative used for biosensor design.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2007-01-30", "authors": ["YanjunDing", "JiaLiu", "HuaWang", "GuoliShen", "RuqinYu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.12.025"}
{"title": "Structural health monitoring using piezoelectric impedance measurements.", "abstract": "This paper presents an overview and recent advances in impedance-based structural health monitoring. The basic principle behind this technique is to apply high-frequency structural excitations (typically greater than 30kHz) through surface-bonded piezoelectric transducers, and measure the impedance of structures by monitoring the current and voltage applied to the piezoelectric transducers. Changes in impedance indicate changes in the structure, which in turn can indicate that damage has occurred. An experimental study is presented to demonstrate how this technique can be used to detect structural damage in real time. Signal processing methods that address damage classifications and data compression issues associated with the use of the impedance methods are also summarized. Finally, a modified frequency-domain autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) is described. The frequency-domain ARX model, constructed by measured impedance data, is used to diagnose structural damage with levels of statistical confidence.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

Even after mesh repair an altered collagen formation and insufficient mesh integration has been found as main reason for recurrences. Therefore, the development of bioactive mesh materials to achieve a local modification of the scar formation to improve patients outcome is advisable.\nA polyvinylidenfluoride mesh material (PVDF) was constructed and surface modified by plasma-induced graft polymerization of acrylic acid (PVDF + PAAc). Surface supplementation was sought by binding of gentamicin to the provided active sites of the grafted mesh surfaces (PVDF+PAAc+Gentamicin). In vivo modulation of collagen formation was evaluated in a standardized animal model where an abdominal wall replacement was performed in 45 Sprague-Dawley rats. Seven, 21, and 90 days after mesh implantation, collagen/protein ratio and the collagen type I/III ratio as well as the expression of type I alpha 1 collagen mRNA (SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR) were analyzed at the perifilamentary region. Additionally, expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-8/-13) has been investigated immunohistochemically.\nImplantation of the PVDF + PAAc + Gentamicin mesh induced a significantly decreased expression of MMP-8 and MMP-13 at the interface 21 and 90 days after implantation compared to the other groups. Whereas no significant effect was observed comparing the overall collagen/protein ratio, the quality of collagen formation expressed by the collagen type I/III ratio showed significantly higher ratios around the PVDF + PAAc + Gentamicin mesh 21 and 90 days after implantation. Correspondingly, an up to 5.3-fold expression of type I alpha 1 collagen mRNA was found.\nThe present data confirm that a surface modification of PVDF mesh samples using plasma-induced graft polymerization of acrylic acid and supplementation of gentamicin is able to improve scar quality and mesh integration.", "journal": "Langenbeck's archives of surgery", "date": "2007-01-24", "authors": ["KarstenJunge", "UweKlinge", "RaphaelRosch", "PetraLynen", "MarcelBinneb\u00f6sel", "JoachimConze", "Peter RMertens", "RobertSchwab", "VolkerSchumpelick"], "doi": "10.1007/s00423-006-0138-1"}

This drift increasingly limits the resolution of advanced surface-coupled, single-molecule experiments. We overcame this drift and achieved atomic-scale stabilization (0.1 nm) of an optical microscope in 3D. This was accomplished by measuring the position of a fiducial mark coupled to the microscope cover slip using back-focal-plane (BFP) detection and correcting for the drift using a piezoelectric stage. Several significant factors contributed to this experimental realization, including (i) dramatically reducing the low frequency noise in BFP detection, (ii) increasing the sensitivity of BFP detection to vertical motion, and (iii) fabricating a regular array of nanometer-sized fiducial marks that were firmly coupled to the cover slip. With these improvements, we achieved short-term (1 s) stabilities of 0.11, 0.10, and 0.09 nm (rms) and long-term (100 s) stabilities of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.35 nm (rms) in x, y, and z, respectively, as measured by an independent detection laser.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2007-01-18", "authors": ["Ashley RCarter", "Gavin MKing", "Theresa AUlrich", "WayneHalsey", "DavidAlchenberger", "Thomas TPerkins"], "doi": "10.1364/ao.46.000421"}

In particular, we consider the perovskite piezoelectric ceramic in which the polarization process in the material can be modeled by Landau theory for the first-order phase transformation, in which each polarization state is associated with a minimum of the Landau free-energy function. Nonlinear constitutive laws are obtained by using thermodynamical equilibrium conditions, and hysteretic behavior of the material can be modeled intrinsically. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory is used in the parameter identification involving hysteresis effects. We use the Chebyshev collocation method in the numerical simulations. The elastic field is assumed to be coupled linearly with other fields, and the nonlinearity is in the E-D coupling. We present numerical results for the reciprocal-transducer system and identify the influence of nonlinearities on the system dynamics at high and low frequency as well as electrical impedance effects due to tuning by a series inductance.

A parallel resistor connected to both input terminals of the PT is needed to improve the transient characteristics. An equivalent circuit for the PT is first given. Then, an open-circuit voltage, involving a direct current (DC) component and an alternating current (AC) component, and its related energy losses are derived from the equivalent circuit with initial conditions. Moreover, an AC power control system, including a DC-to-AC resonant inverter, a control switch and electronic instruments, is constructed to determine the electrical characteristics of the OFF transient state. Furthermore, the effects of the parallel resistor on the transient characteristics at different parallel resistances are measured. The advantages of adding the parallel resistor also are discussed.

The films were deposited at room temperature and had typical full-width, half-maximum value of the rocking curve of about 2 degrees. Thin film plate acoustic resonators were designed and micromachined using low resolution photolithography and deep silicon etching. Plate waves, having a 12-microm wavelength, were excited by means of both interdigital (IDT) and longitudinal wave transducers using lateral field excitation (LW-LFE), and reflected by periodical aluminum-strip gratings deposited on top of the membrane.

Specific probes [a 30-mer oligonucleotide with or without additional 12 deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate (12-dT)] for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 gene eaeA, synthetic oligonucleotide targets (30 and 104 mer) and PCR-amplified DNA fragments from the E. coli O157:H7 eaeA gene (104 bp), were used to evaluate the efficiency of the probe immobilization and hybridization with target DNA in the circulating-flow quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device. It was found that thiol modification on the 5'-end of the probes was essential for probe immobilization on the gold surface of the QCM device. The addition of 12-dT to the probes as a spacer, significantly enhanced (P<0.05) the hybridization efficiency (H%). The results indicate that the spacer enhanced the H% by 1.4- and 2-fold when the probes were hybridized with 30- and 104-mer targets, respectively.

We studied this mucus, its content of proteins and mucins, and the mucin O-glycosylation in cervical secretions before, during, and after ovulation. Cervical mucosal secretions from 12 subjects were collected, reduced-alkylated, separated with polyacrylamide or agarose/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and stained with silver, Alcian blue, or Coomassie Blue stain. Protein and mucin bands from before and during ovulation were digested and subsequently analyzed by nano-LC-FT-ICR MS and MS/MS. We identified 194 proteins after searches against the NCBI non-redundant protein database and an in-house mucin database. Three gel-forming (MUC5B, MUC5AC, and MUC6) and two transmembrane mucins (MUC16 and MUC1) were identified. For the analysis of mucin O-glycosylation, separated mucins from six individuals were blotted to PVDF membranes, and the O-glycans were released by reductive beta-elimination and analyzed with capillary HPLC-MS and -MS/MS. At least 50 neutral, sialic acid-, and sulfate-containing oligosaccharides were found. An increase of GlcNAc-6GalNAcol Core 2 structures and a relative decrease of NeuAc residues are typical for ovulation, and NeuAc-6GalNAcol and NeuAc-3Gal- epitopes are typical for the non-ovulatory phases. The cervical mucus at ovulation is thus characterized by a relative increase in neutral fucosylated oligosaccharides.

European community legislators have therefore restricted the veterinary use of antibiotics and banned them as growth-promoting food additives in stock breeding (1831/2003/EC). The monitoring of such legislation requires technology for precise and straightforward on-site quantification of antibiotics in farm samples and food products without the need for extensive laboratory equipment and trained personnel. Capitalizing on bacterial transcriptional regulators (TetR, PIP, E), which are dose-dependently released from their cognate operators (tetO, PIR, ETR) upon binding of specific classes of antibiotics (tetracycline, streptogramins, macrolides) we have designed an easy-to-handle dipstick-based assay for detection of antibiotic levels in serum, meat and milk whose detection limits are up to 40-fold below licensed threshold values. The generic dipstick consists of either nitrocellulose, nylon or polyvinylidenfluorid (PVDF) membrane strips coated with streptavidin and immobilized biotinylated operator DNA, which acts as capture DNA to bind hexa-histidine (His(6))-tagged bacterial biosensors. Antibiotics present in specific samples triggered the dose-dependent release of the capture DNA-biosensor interaction, which, after dipping into two different solutions, results in a correlated conversion of a chromogenic substrate by a standard His(6)-targeted enzyme complex. This can be quantified by comparison of the dipstick to a standardized color scale or by assessing the terminal solution at 450nm. As demonstrated using serum, meat and milk samples spiked with 14 different antibiotics, the dipstick technology provided sensitive detection in a rapid assay format, and could be employed to monitor non-authorized use of antibiotics and to discover novel antibiotics.", "journal": "Journal of biotechnology", "date": "2007-01-02", "authors": ["NilsLink", "WilfriedWeber", "MartinFussenegger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiotec.2006.11.011"}

{"title": "Piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance sensor for trace aqueous cyanide ion determination.", "abstract": "Using selective reaction chemistry, our present research has developed an online, real-time sensor capable of monitoring toxic cyanide at both drinking water standard and environmental regulatory concentrations. Through the use of a flow cell, aqueous samples containing cyanide are reacted with a gold electrode of a piezoelectric crystal to indirectly sense cyanide concentration by the dissolution of metallic gold. The quartz crystal is an AT-cut wafer sandwiched between two neoprene O-rings within the liquid flow cell. The presence of cyanide in solution results in the selective formation of a soluble dicyano-gold complex according to the Elsner reaction: 4Au + 8CN- + 2H2O + O2 <=> 4Au(CN)2- + 4OH-. The resulting loss of gold from the electrode is detected by the piezoelectric crystal as a resonant frequency change. Since free cyanide is a weak acid (pKa = 9.3), available protons compete for cyanide ligands. Therefore, increased sample pH provides higher sensitivity. The detection limits at pH 12 are 16.1 and 2.7 ppb for analysis times of 10 min and 1 h, respectively. The incorporation of the flow cell improves both analyte sensitivity and instrument precision, with an average signal intensity drift of only 5% over a 2-h analysis. The calibrations show excellent linearity over a variety of cyanide concentrations ranging from low ppb to hundreds of ppm. This detection method offers the advantage of selectively detecting cyanides posing a biohazard while avoiding detection of stable metal cyanides. This aspect of the system is based on competitive exchange of available metals and gold with cyanide ligands. Stable metal cyanide complexes possess a higher formation constant than cyanoaurate. This detection system has been configured into a flow injection analysis array for simple adaptation to automation. Anions commonly found in natural waters have been examined for interference effects. Additionally, the sensor is free from interference by aqueous cyanide analogues including thiocyanate. The developed detection system provides rapid cyanide determinations with little sample preparation or instrument supervision.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2006-12-30", "authors": ["Yegor GTimofeyenko", "Jeffrey JRosentreter", "SusanMayo"], "doi": "10.1021/ac060890m"}
{"title": "Hydration and energy dissipation measurements of biomolecules on a piezoelectric quartz oscillator by admittance analyses.", "abstract": "By using a 27-MHz piezoelectric quartz oscillator connected with a vector network analyzer, we obtained resonance frequency decreases (-DeltaFwater) and energy dissipation increases (DeltaDwater) during binding of biotinylated bovine serum albumin, biotinylated ssDNA, biotinylated dsDNA, and biotinylated pullulan to a NeutrAvidin-immobilized 27-MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) plate in aqueous solution, as well as in the wet air phase (98% humidity, -DeltaFwet and DeltaDwet) and in the dry air phase (-DeltaFair and DeltaDair). -DeltaFwater indicates the total mass of the molecule, bound water, and vibrated water in aqueous solutions. -DeltaFwet indicates the total mass of the molecule and bound water. -DeltaFair simply shows the real mass of the molecule on the QCM. In terms of results, (-DeltaFwet)/(-DeltaFair) values indicated the bound water ratios per unit biomolecular mass were on the order of pullulan (2.1-2.2) > DNAs = proteins (1.4-1.6) > polystyrene (1.0). The (-DeltaFwater)/(-DeltaFair) values indicated the hydrodynamic water (bound and vibrated water) ratios per unit biomolecular mass were on the order of dsDNA (6.5) > ssDNA = pullulan (3.5-4.4) > proteins (2.4-2.5) > polystyrene (1.0). Energy dissipation parameters per unit mass in water (DeltaDwater/(-DeltaFair)) were on the order of pullulan > dsDNA > ssDNA > proteins > polystyrene. Energy dissipation in the wet and dry air phases (DeltaDwet and DeltaDair) were negligibly small, which indicates even these biomolecules act as elastic membranes in the air phase (without aqueous solution). We obtained a good linear relationship between [(-DeltaFwater)/(-DeltaFair) - 1], which is indicative of hydration and DeltaDwater/(-DeltaFair) of proteins. The aforementioned values suggest that the energy dissipation of proteins was mainly caused by hydration and that proteins themselves are elastic molecules without energy dissipation in aqueous solutions. On the contrary, plots in cases of denatured proteins, DNAs, and pullulans were relatively deviant toward the large hydration and energy dissipation from the theoretical line as perfect elastic materials, meaning that the large energy dissipation occurs because of viscoelastic properties of denatured proteins, linear DNAs, and pullulans in the water phase, in addition to energy dissipation due to the hydration of molecules. These two parameters could characterize various biomolecules with structural properties in aqueous solutions.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2006-12-30", "authors": ["TomomitsuOzeki", "MizukiMorita", "HiroshiYoshimine", "HiroyukiFurusawa", "YoshioOkahata"], "doi": "10.1021/ac060873x"}

The focus of this work is to collect cells in distinct point locations for potential drug screening array applications. A device to create two-dimensional arrays of cells within a micromachined chamber is described. The chamber is etched into a silicon wafer and sealed with glass; on the underside of the silicon layer a piezoelectric actuator is attached. A signal is applied to each of two orthogonally aligned strips electrodes defined on the surface of the piezoelectric plate. These two strip electrodes create independently addressable approximately one-dimensional pressure fields. It is shown that by applying the same signal to each electrode a diagonally aligned grid of cells can be produced. However, the independence of the two electrodes allows the application of two signals with slightly different frequencies to be applied which creates a grid of circular cell clumps highly suitable for the identified application.

Non-invasive simple tests are needed for the evaluation of children with neurogenic dysphagia including the patients with cerebral palsy. So we aimed to evaluate non-invasive ways to screen for dysphagia in children and the usefulness of this almost new electrophysiologic method for the detection of dysphagia in children with cerebral palsy. Twenty-eight healthy children and 12 patients with cerebral palsy were investigated for the applicability of this method. The movement of the larynx was monitored using a simple piezoelectric wafer sensor and submental surface EMG activity was recorded by bipolar silver-chloride electrodes taped under the chin over the submental muscle complex. The onset and duration of pharyngeal swallowing was recorded from submental-suprahyoid muscles such as the mylohyoid-genitohyoid-anterior digastric complex. By this method, the maximal water volume capacity was measured in single swallows with progressively increasing water volumes, this was called 'dysphagia limit'. The healthy control children revealed to swallow the bolus at once maximally 11.2+/-0.4 and 2.5 ml in average. Dysphagia limit varied from 7 to above 20 ml water volume from age 5-16 years old. Patients with cerebral palsy had the dysphagia limit of 7.7+/-1.8 and 6.4 ml in average. The dysphagia limit was significantly reduced in patients with cerebral palsy (p<0.05). Dysphagia limit seemed to be less sensitive in demonstrating the oropharyngeal swallowing disorders in childhood period (90% in the adult dysphagic patients). But the majority of patients with cerebral palsy (58%) showed abnormality. This electrophysiologic method is completely non-invasive, devoid from any hazard and applicable to children above 5 years.

We utilized the whole-cell QCM biosensors for the detection of the effects of varying concentrations of the microtubule binding drugs taxol and nocodazole by measuring changes in the QCM steady state frequency (Deltaf) and motional resistance (DeltaR), shift values. Using 0.11-50 microM nocodazole, we observed the Deltaf shift values of the biosensors, consisting of 20,000 ECs, to decrease significantly in magnitude (nearly 100%) to a limiting value, in a dose-dependent fashion, over a 5- to 6-h incubation period following drug addition. This effect is consistent with nocodazole's known disruption of intracellular microtubules. On the other hand, 10 microM taxol caused little alteration in Deltaf over the same time period, consistent with its microtubule hyperstabilization effect. When the EC QCM biosensor Deltaf shift values were normalized by the number of ECs found firmly attached to the QCM surface via trypsin removal and electronic counting, the dose curve was shifted to lower nocodazole concentrations, resulting in a more sensitive drug biosensor. The kinetics of the Deltaf decrease with increasing nocodazole concentrations measured by the EC QCM biosensor was found to be similar at all drug concentrations and was well fit by a single first-order exponential decay equation. For all nocodazole doses, t(0.5) was invariant, averaging t(0.5)=0.83+/-0.14 h. These data demonstrate that a single dynamic sensing system within the cell, the microtubules, is disrupted by the addition of nocodazole and this process is sensed by the cell QCM biosensor. This interpretation of the data was confirmed by a fluorescence light microscopy investigation of ECs undergoing treatment with increasing nocodazole doses using a fluorescent antibody to alpha-tubulin. These studies revealed a corresponding loss of the spread morphology of the cells, concomitant with a rearrangement of the extended native microtubules into increasingly large aggregates with the cells eventually lifting from the surface in significant numbers at 50 microM. At 6 microM nocodazole, partial reversibility of the EC QCM biosensor was demonstrated. These results indicate that the EC QCM biosensor can be used to detect and study EC cytoskeleton alterations and dynamics.

Coupons of each material were placed in a biologically active annular reactor for up to 300 days, and subjected to a constant shear field (0.12 N m(-2)), which induced sessile microbial growth from acetate amended municipal tap water. Acoustic monitoring was non-destructively executed by traversing coupons in a constant temperature water bath using a spherically focused 20-MHz immersion transducer. This semi-automated system was configured to obtain reflections from 50 regions (c.a. 120x10(3) microm2) distributed evenly near the centerline of each coupon. The resulting reflected power distributions were compared with standard biochemical and microscopic assays that described surface associated biofilms. When compared to clean (virgin) conditions, biofilms growing on coupons induced consistent attenuations in reflection amplitude, which caused statistically significant shifts in reflected power (p<0.01). Using exocellular polysaccharides as a surrogate measure of total biofilm mass, UFDR was able to detect biofilms developing on any of the materials tested at surface-averaged masses < or = 150 microg cm(-2). Above these threshold levels, increasing amounts of exocellular polysaccharides correlated with significant decreases in total reflected power (TRP). The distribution of biomass on the coupon surfaces determined by acoustic spectra was consistent with that observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM).

Extension of treatment time with cysteine beyond 3h did not further increase fertilization rates, suggesting that cysteine promoted early developmental events after ICSI (e.g. decondensation of sperm chromatin). There was no effect of cysteine supplementation on oocyte glutathione levels after ICSI. Pretreatment of spermatozoa for 3h with 1.71 mM cysteine did not improve fertilization rates. The incidence of blastocysts formation when cultured in 1.71 mM cysteine for 3h after ICSI was 31%, which was higher (P<0.05) than controls (18%). Transfer of 20-38 embryos cultured with 1.71 mM cysteine for 3h after ICSI to each of seven recipients yielded three deliveries with an average litter size of 4.0.

When patterns were made from BSA the neurites preferred to grow in between the lines on the unpatterned plastic surface. We conclude that microdispensing can be used for guidance of sensory neurites. The advantages of microdispensing is that it is fast, flexible, allows deposition of different protein concentrations and enables patterning on delicate surfaces due to its non-contact mode of operation.

{"title": "Intra-operative evaluation of cementless hip implant stability: a prototype device based on vibration analysis.", "abstract": "Cementless implants are mechanically stabilized during surgery by a press-fitting procedure. Good initial stability is crucial to avoid stem loosening and bone cracking, therefore, the surgeon must achieve optimal press-fitting. A possible approach to solve this problem and assist the surgeon in achieving the optimal compromise, involves the use of vibration analysis. The present study aimed to design and test a prototype device able to evaluate the primary mechanical stability of a cementless prosthesis, based on vibration analysis. In particular, the goal was to discriminate between stable and quasi-stable implants; thus the stem-bone system was assumed to be linear in both cases. For that reason, it was decided to study the frequency responses of the system, instead of the harmonic distortion. The prototype developed consists of a piezoelectric exciter connected to the stem and an accelerometer attached to the femur. Preliminary tests were performed on four composite femurs implanted with a conventional stem. The results showed that the input signal was repeatable and the output could be recorded accurately. The most sensitive parameter to stability was the shift in resonance frequency of the stem-bone system, which was highly correlated with residual micromotion on all four specimens.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2006-11-15", "authors": ["MaurizioLannocca", "ElenaVarini", "AngeloCappello", "LucaCristofolini", "EwaBialoblocka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2006.09.011"}
{"title": "Force-length relations in isolated intact cardiomyocytes subjected to dynamic changes in mechanical load.", "abstract": "We developed a dynamic force-length (FL) control system for single intact cardiomyocytes that uses a pair of compliant, computer-controlled, and piezo translator (PZT)-positioned carbon fibers (CF). CF are attached to opposite cell ends to afford dynamic and bidirectional control of the cell's mechanical environment. PZT and CF tip positions, as well as sarcomere length (SL), are simultaneously monitored in real time, and passive/active forces are calculated from CF bending. Cell force and length were dynamically adjusted by corresponding changes in PZT position, to achieve isometric, isotonic, or work-loop style contractions. Functionality of the technique was assessed by studying FL behavior of guinea pig intact cardiomyocytes. End-diastolic and end-systolic FL relations, obtained with varying preload and/or afterloads, were near linear, independent of the mode of contraction, and overlapping for the range of end-diastolic SLs tested (1.85-2.05 micro m). Instantaneous elastance curves, obtained from FL relation curves, showed an afterload-dependent decrease in time to peak elastance and slowed relaxation with both increased preload and afterload. The ability of the present system to independently and dynamically control preload, afterload, and transition between end-diastolic and end-systolic FL coordinates provides a valuable extension to the range of tools available for the study of single cardiomyocyte mechanics, to foster its interrelation with whole heart pathophysiology.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

A protein sample is transferred from a 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) gel onto a PVDF membrane by electroblotting. The membrane carrying the protein is directly subjected to protein sequencing. If sequencing fails after a few cycles, the PVDF membrane is removed from the sequencer and treated with deblocking solution. If this attempt at sequencing fails, alternative methods such as the Cleveland method are required.

{"title": "Knee loading dynamically alters intramedullary pressure in mouse femora.", "abstract": "Dynamic mechanical loads have been known to stimulate bone formation. Many biophysical factors such as number of daily loading cycles, bone strain, strain-induced interstitial fluid flow, molecular transport, and modulation of intramedullary pressure have been considered as potential mediators in mechanotransduction of bone. Using a knee loading modality that enhances anabolic responses in mouse hindlimb, we addressed a question: Do oscillatory loads applied to the knee induce dynamic alteration of intramedullary pressure in the femoral medullary cavity? To answer this question, mechanical loads were applied to the knee with a custom-made piezoelectric loader and intramedullary pressure in the femoral medullary cavity was measured with a fiber optic pressure sensor. We observed that in response to sinusoidal forces of 0.5 Hz and 10 Hz, pressure amplitude increased up to 4-N loads and reached a plateau at 130 Pa. This amplitude significantly decreased with a loading frequency above 20 Hz. To confirm alteration of intramedullary pressure, real-time motion of microparticles in a glass tube inserted to the femoral medullary cavity ex vivo was visualized. Taken together, these data reveal that knee loading dynamically alters intramedullary pressure as a function of loading intensities and frequencies.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2006-10-31", "authors": ["PingZhang", "MinSu", "YunlongLiu", "AndrewHsu", "HirokiYokota"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2006.09.018"}

The polymer biomaterials used in this study included polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVAL), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). For cells cultured in the presence of serum, cell mobility after being cultured on PVA substrates was considerably higher than that on EVAL or PVDF substrates. This effect was completely suppressed by cycloheximide (CHX) in the serum-free medium. Taken together, the cell surface charge property can be altered after cells cultured on different polymer substrates.

The cells were adhered and grown on the gold surface of the sensor pre-coated with adsorbed layer of extracellular matrix proteins as vitronectin and laminin. The process of cell attachment and spreading on the gold surface was continuously monitored and displayed by changes of the resonant frequency Deltaf and resistance DeltaR values of the piezoelectric resonators. The initial phase of cell attachment and spreading induced a decrease of frequency and increase of resistance relating viscoelastic properties of the cell monolayer on the sensing surface. The steady-state of both shifts was achieved after a few hours. The presence and state of cells on the surface was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy.

Separate and multiple, equally tensioned strands of hamstring grafts used for the reconstruction of the ACL were biomechanically tested and compared to original ACL and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts, using tissue samples from cadavers. The study was focused on measuring such material properties as the strength, stiffness, maximum load, and elongation at maximum load of the original ACL, BPTB graft, and single tendon hamstring (gracilis and semitendinosus) grafts, continued by double strands and finally by four-strand graft (STG) evaluation. Fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used, which had been clamped and tensioned equally. The measurement was performed by drop-weight testing, using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer as a basic sensor of the dynamic movements of the gripping clamps, with parallel correlation by a piezoelectric transducer. The grafts for experiments were obtained from 21-paired knees. The measurement was performed at room temperature (21 degrees C) after 24 h of thawing at 4 degrees C. All the specimens were measured for their response to the dynamic tensile load. The maximum strength values were obtained and calculated for the appropriate section area of the specimen. The tensioned strands of the original ACL showed a maximum average load of 1,246 +/- 243 N in the section area of about 30 mm(2) (max. stress 41.3 MPa); the strands of BPTB grafts showed values of 3,855 +/- 550 N in the section area of 80 mm(2) (max. stress 40.6 MPa); the gracilis tendons showed 925 +/- 127 N in the section area of 10 mm(2) (max. stress 95.1 MPa) and the semitendinosuss yielded a result of 2,050 +/- 159 N in the area of 20 mm(2) (max. stress 88.7 MPa). Of all the materials, the original ACL have the lowest strength and stiffness in respect of their biomechanical properties. BPTB grafts showed a slightly higher value of maximum stress, while both the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons showed double the value of maximum load per section area-tensile stress. Two- and four- combined hamstring strands clamped together and equally tensioned with a drop-weight had the combined tensile strength properties of the individual strands within the estimated range of measurement errors. No significant changes in maximum loads/stresses were observed under impact loading conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that equally tensioned four-strand hamstring-tendon grafts have higher initial tensile properties than those in other varieties of samples.

Material properties in the model are determined from experimental measurements reported in the literature, and the variation of material properties with the cell length is studied. The cortical lattice's Poisson ratios are found to remain fairly constant with cell length, while its stiffness changes significantly with cell length. The natural frequencies corresponding to several modes of deformation of an OHC with intracellular and extracellular fluids are calculated from this model. Our results suggest that the best frequency in the cochlea at the position where the OHC is located corresponds to different modes of deformation of the OHC, depending on the OHC length. For short OHCs, the best frequency is close to the natural frequency of the axisymmetric mode; for long OHCs, it is close to the natural frequencies of the beam-like bending and pinched modes. Such a difference in resonant modes for short and long OHCs at the best frequency suggests that different modes of OHC elongation motility may be present in amplifying the basilar membrane motion in the high and low frequency regions of the cochlea.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2006-07-11", "authors": ["Kian-MengLim", "HaiLongLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.05.009"}
