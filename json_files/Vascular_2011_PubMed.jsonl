There is a slight predilection for the mandible. More frequent sites for this tumor are the vertebral column, sacrum, long bones, and calvarium. A small predilection in males exists. The age of occurrence ranges from 5 to 37 years, with an average of 16.5. Clinically, patients have pain and swelling. The tumor contains a well-vascularized, osteoblastic connective tissue stroma. Osteoclasts may also be present. Osteoid with varying degrees of calcification, as well as immature bone, is noted.\nVery few cases of osteoblastomas occurring in the jaws have been reported in the literature. This is one such a rare case report of OB occurring in a 45 year old female patient with a swelling in right lower back region since 5 years.\nOsteoblastoma has to be differentiated from other bone lesions for correct diagnosis. Many bone producing lesions possess some overlapping clinical, radiographic or histopathological findings similar to osteoblastoma.

{"title": "US imaging in operated tendons.", "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) plays an essential role in the follow-up of operated tendons. The US operator must keep in mind three main elements: healing of traumatic injuries of the tendons seems to follow the biological model of histologic healing, surgical repair of a tendon rupture improves the structural parameters of the operated tendon, but it does not grant restitutio ad integrum, and US findings therefore seem poorly correlated with the functional evolution.Before examination, the US operator should be familiar with the nature of the tendon injury that has led to surgery including location, severity, time elapsed between tendon injury and surgical repair, surgical technique, postoperative course and possible complications. US findings in operated as well as non-operated tendons depend on several factors: morphology, structure, vascularization of the tendon, mobility of the tendon and mobility of the peritendinous tissues. Particular features are therefore considered according to the location: shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, knee, ankle and foot. Interpretation of the US image requires knowledge of the surgical technique and \"normal\" postoperative appearance of the operated tendon in order to detect pathological findings such as thinning, persistent fluid collections within or around the tendon, persistent hypervascularization, intratendinous calcifications and adhesions.\nSommarioL\u2019ecografia riveste un ruolo essenziale nel follow-up dei tendini operati.

Simple reconstructive methods such as skin grafts, locoregional flaps, or tissue expanders are often not feasible due to a myriad of reasons. Vascularized free tissue transfer coverage offers distinct advantages in managing these defects. A retrospective case series was performed on all patients at the University of Washington Medical Center who had scalp or LTB defects reconstructed with free tissue transfer from May 1996 to July 2009. Cases were analyzed for defect characteristics, flap type, vessel selection, radiation status, dural exposure, complications, and outcomes. Sixty-eight free flaps were performed in 65 patients with scalp or LTB defects. Twenty-two resections included craniotomy, and 48 patients had pre- or postoperative radiation. Defects ranged from 6 to 836 cm(2). All flaps (46 latissimus, 11 rectus, 4 radial forearm, 6 anterolateral thigh, and 1 omental) were transferred successfully. Vein grafts were required in five cases. Complications included delayed flap failure requiring secondary reconstruction, neck hematoma, venous thrombosis, skull base infection, large wound dehiscence, small wound dehiscence, donor site hematoma and seroma, and cerebrospinal fluid leak. Cosmetic results were consistent and durable. Microvascular free tissue transfer is a safe, reliable method of reconstructing scalp and LTB defects and offers favorable cosmetic results.

Therefore, we designed a consecutive and prospective study to investigate post-operative pain relief in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head by FVFG.\nOne hundred and fifty-one patients with unilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head were enrolled consecutively for current prospective study from January to August of 2006. Patients were managed by modified technique of free vascularized fibular grafting.

{"title": "Concise review: clinical translation of wound healing therapies based on mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "There is enormous worldwide demand for therapies to promote the efficient resolution of hard-to-heal wounds with minimal appearance of scarring. Recent in vitro studies with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have identified numerous mechanisms by which these cells can promote the process of wound healing, and there is significant interest in the clinical translation of an MSC-based therapy to promote dermal regeneration. This review provides a systematic analysis of recent preclinical and clinical research to evaluate the use of MSCs in wound healing applications. These in vivo studies provide overwhelming evidence that MSCs can accelerate wound closure by modulating the inflammatory environment, promoting the formation of a well-vascularized granulation matrix, encouraging the migration of keratinocytes, and inhibiting apoptosis of wound healing cells. The trophic effects of MSC therapy also appear to augment wound healing in diabetic tissues, thereby preventing the formation of nonhealing ulcers. Finally, a number of delivery systems have been evaluated and indicate that MSCs could be the basis of a versatile therapy to fulfill the clinical needs for dermal regeneration. However, despite the apparent advantages of MSC-based therapies, there have been only limited clinical investigations of this type of therapy in humans. Thus, our review concludes with a discussion of the translational barriers that are limiting the widespread clinical use of MSCs to enhance wound healing.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2012-12-01", "authors": ["Wesley MJackson", "Leon JNesti", "Rocky STuan"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2011-0024"}

{"title": "Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis: good and evil.", "abstract": "The vascular network delivers oxygen (O(2)) and nutrients to all cells within the body. It is therefore not surprising that O(2) availability serves as a primary regulator of this complex organ. Most transcriptional responses to low O(2) are mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), highly conserved transcription factors that control the expression of numerous angiogenic, metabolic, and cell cycle genes. Accordingly, the HIF pathway is currently viewed as a master regulator of angiogenesis. HIF modulation could provide therapeutic benefit for a wide array of pathologies, including cancer, ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease, wound healing, and neovascular eye diseases. Hypoxia promotes vessel growth by upregulating multiple pro-angiogenic pathways that mediate key aspects of endothelial, stromal, and vascular support cell biology. Interestingly, recent studies show that hypoxia influences additional aspects of angiogenesis, including vessel patterning, maturation, and function. Through extensive research, the integral role of hypoxia and HIF signaling in human disease is becoming increasingly clear. Consequently, a thorough understanding of how hypoxia regulates angiogenesis through an ever-expanding number of pathways in multiple cell types will be essential for the identification of new therapeutic targets and modalities.", "journal": "Genes & cancer", "date": "2012-08-07", "authors": ["Bryan LKrock", "NicolasSkuli", "M CelesteSimon"], "doi": "10.1177/1947601911423654"}

Next, we contrast dynamic pattern formation in embryos to the vascularization of relatively static tissues, such as the retina.

Dynamic empirical data, derived from quail embryos, show that vascular beds readily form within a moving extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment-which we analogize to the de novo vascularization of small rapidly growing tumors.

Six anesthetized albino rabbits received a single transcorneal intravitreal injection of 1 \u03bcg (group A) or 2 \u03bcg (group B) of topotecan. Vitreous and blood samples were collected until 168 h. Left eyes were treated with the same volume of saline. Plasma and vitreous levels of topotecan were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) was calculated using trapezoidal rule. Clinical evidence of toxicity was classified into four grades according to anatomical structures. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded.\nTime to maximum concentration was observed up to 2 h after drug injection in group A whereas up to 1 h in group B. Low levels of topotecan were detected in plasma in both groups and in the vitreous humor of the contralateral eye in group B. Topotecan levels (mean vitreous AUC in group A 2.55 \u03bcg/mL.h and in group B 5.338 \u03bcg/mL.h) were detectable up to 6 h in both groups. We observed following structural changes in rabbit eyes: corneal vascularization, cataract, hemophthalmus, choroidal edema and focal retinal atrophy. Abnormal ERGs were obtained.\nOur findings proved that transcorneal intravitreal administration of 1 \u03bcg and 2 \u03bcg of topotecan results in potentially cytotoxic intraocular concentrations.

{"title": "Usefulness of blood supply visualization by indocyanine green fluorescence for reconstruction during esophagectomy.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adequate blood supply for the reconstructed organ is important for safe esophagogastric anastomosis during esophagectomy. Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) has been used for visualization of the blood supply when anastomosis is performed in vascular surgery. To visualize the blood supply for reconstruction, we employed ICG fluorescence during esophagectomy. METHODS: From August 2008, 40 patients received cervical or thoracic esophagectomy. They consisted of 33 patients having esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer, 3 being treated for cervical esophageal cancer, and 4 with double cancer of the thoracic and cervical regions. Before and after pulling up the reconstructed organ, 2.5\u00a0mg of ICG was injected as a bolus. Then ICG fluorescence was detected by a camera and recorded. RESULTS: ICG fluorescence was easily detected in all patients at 1\u00a0min after injection. The vascular network was well visualized in the gastric wall, colonic grafts, and free jejunal grafts. In five patients, we also performed anastomosis between the short gastric vein and the external cervical vein or superficial cervical vein. The intraoperative and postoperative course of all patients was uneventful apart from three anastomotic leakages. CONCLUSIONS: ICG fluorescence can be employed to evaluate the blood supply to reconstructed organs and can be useful in selecting the patients who do not need additional vessel anastomosis. However, anastomotic leakage was not reduced, so the microcirculation detected by ICG fluorescence did not necessarily provide appropriate blood supply for a viable anastomosis.", "journal": "Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society", "date": "2012-05-05", "authors": ["YutakaShimada", "TomoyukiOkumura", "TakuyaNagata", "ShigeakiSawada", "KoshiMatsui", "RyotaHori", "IsakuYoshioka", "ToruYoshida", "RyusukeOsada", "KazuhiroTsukada"], "doi": "10.1007/s10388-011-0291-7\n10.1046/j.1442-2050.2001.00166.x\n10.1097/00000658-200008000-00013\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.05.016\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.04.020\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2004.02.034\n10.1007/BF01676880\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2007.09.016\n10.1159/000171780\n10.1007/s00268-002-6366-9\n10.1067/mtc.2001.117835\n10.2325/jbcs.12.211\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181927267\n10.1245/s10434-009-0711-2\n10.1016/S0003-4975(02)04669-6\n10.1055/s-2001-19929\n10.1016/j.ejvs.2007.09.001\n10.1159/000121905\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2004.02.068\n10.1378/chest.128.5.3461\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.11.033\n10.1111/j.1758-5910.2009.00025.x\n10.1007/s00268-008-9620-y\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.09.001\n10.1055/s-2004-826102\n10.1007/s00595-008-3827-2\n10.1159/000052018\n10.1016/S0002-9610(99)00161-0\n10.1016/S1072-7515(99)00234-3"}

This study was conducted prospectively and focused on ureteral stricture, which occurs mainly during the 2 years after surgery.\nBetween January1999 and June 2009, a total of 100 consecutive patients (five women and 95 men) with bladder cancer underwent cystectomy followed by construction of a Hautmann neobladder. The median age of the patients was 62 (36-78) years.

In eleven RU, hydronephrosis was present preoperatively and improved postoperatively. In ten others RU, hydronephrosis persisted postoperatively without symptoms. The anastomotic stricture rate was 4%, concerning eight RU by seven patients. Five inflammatory strictures (2.5%) occurred early on the 5th, 6th, 8th and 13th postoperative weeks and were revealed by pyelonephritis.

This study was performed to assess CT features of the low attenuation and to correlate them with histological features. Chest CT scans of 80 patients without chest wall abnormalities in the first eight decades of age with ten consecutive patients in each decade were reviewed. Histological examinations and CT of three costal cartilage specimens, one each from three cadavers, were done. Of the 80 patients, low attenuation areas were noted in 32% of the upper seven costal cartilages and in 64 patients (80%) without significant sexual difference (P = 0.503 and 0.786, respectively). The areas appeared more frequently in the lower costal cartilages than the upper ones, and were mostly symmetrical in distribution (82%). They were usually ill defined (74%) and similar in attenuation to the chest wall muscle (94%), located centrally (100%), and at most a half of the cartilage diameter. In all three cartilage specimens, central areas were grossly distinct from surrounding areas, and were corresponded to low attenuation areas on CT. At histological exam, the central areas showed multiple foci of vascularized loose connective tissue and fat on myxoid background, generally agreeing with the previous description of cartilage canals, a kind of nutrient channel.

Perlecan is a large proteoglycan (400-500 kDa) present in virtually all vascularized tissues with a distribution that is primarily confined to basement membranes including those of oral mucosa.

Perlecan is also synthesized by vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells present in the extracellular matrix. It has been demonstrated in recent years that perlecan is distributed in the stromal space of various pathophysiological conditions. The complex pleiotropy of perlecan suggests that this gene product is involved in several developmental processes, at both early and late stages of embryogenesis, as well as in cancer and diabetes. In the oral cavity, perlecan expression is reported to basal cells in normal mucosa and its expression increases in precancer and cancerous conditions.

{"title": "Arterial spin labeling measurements of cerebral perfusion territories in experimental ischemic stroke.", "abstract": "Collateral circulation, defined as the supplementary vascular network that maintains cerebral blood flow (CBF) when the main vessels fail, constitutes one important defense mechanism of the brain against ischemic stroke. In the present study, continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) was used to quantify CBF and obtain perfusion territory maps of the major cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Results show that both WKY and SHR have complementary, yet significantly asymmetric perfusion territories. Right or left dominances were observed in territories of the anterior (ACA), middle and posterior cerebral arteries, and the thalamic artery. Magnetic resonance angiography showed that some of the asymmetries were correlated with variations of the ACA. The leptomeningeal circulation perfusing the outer layers of the cortex was observed as well. Significant and permanent changes in perfusion territories were obtained after temporary occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in both SHR and WKY, regardless of their particular dominance. However, animals with right dominance presented a larger volume change of the left perfusion territory (23\u2009\u00b1\u20099%) than animals with left dominance (7\u2009\u00b1\u20095%, P\u2009<\u20090.002). The data suggest that animals with contralesional dominance primarily safeguard local CBF values with small changes in contralesional perfusion territory, while animals with ipsilesional dominance show a reversal of dominance and a substantial increase in contralesional perfusion territory.

{"title": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in Crohn's disease: technique, image interpretation and clinical applications.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analysis has demonstrated no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy among different imaging techniques (US, MRI and CT) in the evaluation of Crohn's disease (CD). High-resolution bowel ultrasound has emerged as an alternative imaging technique for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CD, being as accurate as CT and MR for detecting intramural and extramural extension of the disease. B-Mode US can evaluate the localization and length of the affected intestinal segments and allow identification of transmural complications, stenosis and intestinal obstruction. Doppler techniques are tools that visualize and quantify bowel vascularization. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a new technique that involves IV administration of an ultrasound contrast agent with real-time examination, providing an accurate depiction of the bowel wall microvascularization and the perienteric tissues. The introduction of imaging quantification techniques enables an objective quantitative measurement of the enhancement. METHOD AND RESULTS: The article reviews the technique, sonographic findings, advantages and limitations, and clinical applications of contrast-enhanced US in the evaluation of Cohn's disease. Current CEUS applications in CD are: CD activity assessment, evaluation of inflammatory masses, distinguishing phlegmons from abscesses, characterization of stenosis by differentiating fibrosis from inflammation, monitoring the efficacy of drug treatments and improving the detection of disease recurrence. CONCLUSION: CEUS is an emerging technique that is part of the entire sonographic evaluation, with a role in the diagnosis and follow-up of CD, thus improving therapy planning and monitoring of the efficacy of treatment.

{"title": "Biologic scaffold remodeling in a dog model of complex musculoskeletal injury.", "abstract": "Current treatment principles for muscle injuries with volumetric loss have been largely derived from empirical observations. Differences in severity or anatomic location have determinant effects on the tissue remodeling outcome. Biologic scaffolds composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) have been successfully used to restore vascularized, innervated, and contractile skeletal muscle in animal models but limited anatomic locations have been evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of a xenogeneic ECM scaffold to restore functional skeletal muscle in a canine model of a complex quadriceps injury involving bone, tendon, and muscle.\nSixteen dogs were subjected to unilateral resection of the distal third of the vastus lateralis and medial half of the distal third of the vastus medialis muscles including the proximal half of their associated quadriceps tendon. This defect was replaced with a biologic scaffold composed of small intestinal submucosa extracellular matrix (SIS-ECM) and the remodeling response was evaluated at 1, 2, 3, and 6 mo (N = 4 per group).\nThe initial remodeling process followed a similar pattern to other studies of ECM-mediated muscle repair with rapid vascularization and migration of myoblasts into the defect site. However, over time the remodeling response resulted in the formation of dense collagenous tissue with islands of muscle in the segments of the scaffold not in contact with bone, and foci of bone and cartilage in the segments that were adjacent to the underlying bone.\nSIS-ECM was not successful at restoring functional muscle tissue in this model. However, the results also suggest that SIS-ECM may have potential to promote integration of soft and boney tissues when implanted in close apposition to bone.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2012-02-22", "authors": ["Neill JTurner", "John SBadylak", "Douglas JWeber", "Stephen FBadylak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2011.11.1029"}

The aim of this study was to characterize this disorder of post-operative partial hypoparathyroidism and to identify any risk factors.\nA retrospective study of patients undergoing a total thyroidectomy was performed. Patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism were excluded. Patients completed a telephone interview and had serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measured. Patient demographics, operative indications and intervention, the number of parathyroid glands autotransplanted, the presence of ongoing symptoms and calcium requirements were documented.\nOne hundred ninety-six patients participated. The overall rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism over the duration of the study was 0.77%. An additional 10 (5%) patients were identified with a normal PTH level but who were still requiring calcium supplementation to prevent the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia and to maintain a normal serum calcium level. Nine patients were female with a mean age of 48.5 years. A mean of 1.4 parathyroid glands were autotransplanted and the mean PTH level was 3.95 pmol/L.\nThis study demonstrates that in a small group of patients following total thyroidectomy, re-vascularization of parathyroid cells may be partial, with inadequate parathyroid reserve to avoid symptoms despite measurable PTH levels.

Although modern reconstruction methods with various muscle flaps have reduced morbidity and mortality, chest wall reconstruction presents unique challenges. Major categories of adverse outcomes include (1) persistent infection; (2) interference with respiratory mechanics; (3) functional deficits of the shoulder; and (4) hernias. Persistent infection may be resolved by providing coverage via muscle or omental flap, performing thorough debridement, filling the \"dead space\" with adequate volume, buttressing repair of visceral fistulae, and covering exposed prosthetic material with vascularized flaps. Potential deficits in respiratory mechanics and shoulder function may be avoided by stabilizing the chest wall skeleton and decreasing donor muscle functional loss.

{"title": "A quantitative study to design an experimental setup for photoacoustic imaging.", "abstract": "During the last decade, a new modality called photoacoustic imaging has emerged. The increasing interest for this new modality is due to the fact that it combines advantages of ultrasound and optical imaging, i.e. the high contrast due to optical absorption and the low acoustic attenuation in biological tissues. It is thus possible to study vascularization because blood has high optical absorption coefficient. Papers in the literature often focus on applications and rarely discuss quantitative parameters. The goal of this paper is to provide quantitative elements to design an acquisition setup. By defining the targeted resolution and penetration depth, it is then possible to evaluate which kind of excitation and reception systems have to be used. First, we recall theoretical background related to photoacoustic effect before to describe the experiments based on a nanosecond laser at 1064 nm and 2.25-5 MHz transducers. Second, we present results about the relation linking fluence laser to signal amplitude and axial and lateral resolutions of our acquisition setup. We verify the linear relation between fluence and amplitude before to estimate axial resolution at 550 \u03bcm for a 2.25 MHz ultrasonic transducer.

{"title": "Spatiotemporal control of cell fate and cardiac differentiation.", "abstract": "Congestive heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide [1]. Although not the only cause of congestive heart failure, loss of myocardium due to obstructive coronary artery disease is a major contributor to this condition [2,3]. The loss of myocardium is mainly regional and, therefore, localized therapy holds the most promise. In recent years, many clinical studies have been initiated to deliver localized therapy in the form of various cell types for reconstitution of the myocardium [4-6]. However, there is much debate on the optimal cell type, whether or not stem cells can differentiate into functional myocardium and the long-term effects of these non-myocytes. In addition to exogenous cell delivery, paracrine effects arising from delivery of angiogenic factors and other biochemical agents suggest that the myocardium retains the ability to remodel and heal [7,8]. Understandably, there has been tremendous focus on both growth factor- and gene therapy-based therapeutics. While a source of great promise, direct growth factor delivery to the myocardium will most likely be inefficient as several studies have noted that many of these small proteins are carried away in the highly vascularized cardiac tissue [9,10]. Gene therapy, while providing an excellent analytical tool, has not met with enthusiasm clinically, mostly due to the inability to quantify delivery and nonspecific targeting in vivo. This body of work supports two crucial conclusions: (1) appropriate biological cues that act locally on the myocardium can improve functional outcomes, and (2) spatiotemporal control over the delivery and presentation of these cues remains challenging and inefficient. The current body of work on cardiac drug delivery and stem cell therapy support two crucial conclusions: (1) appropriate biological cues that act locally on the myocardium can improve functional outcomes, and (2) spatiotemporal control over the delivery and presentation of these cues remains challenging and inefficient. Using specialized biomaterials, we are able to address this. Our laboratory has used functional nanoparticles to deliver regenerative cues with both spatial and temporal control. By adding biomimetic signals to the surface of the nanoparticles, we are able to enhance nonphagocytic cell uptake, achieve cell-specific targeting, and deliver molecules in a time-controlled manner. Furthermore, by combining our nanoparticles with self-assembling peptide nanofibers, we can achieve some of these in 3D while retaining implanted cells. Following infarction, and during cell differentiation and survival, there are unique sequences of events that contribute to the pathophysiology of the processes. By enhanced understanding of these signals, and the spatiotemporal control needed to deliver them, it will help design better therapeutics for cardiac regeneration. Using high-throughput screening, we have identified several carbohydrates that bind with high affinity to both cardiomyocytes and cardiac progenitor cells. For example, n-acetylglucasmine (GlcNAc) and related sugars bound with high affinity to both of these important cell types. Modification of the sugars with phospholipds allowed incorporation of into hydrophobic nanoparticles with high fidelity. When delivered to cardiomyocytes or cardiac progenitor cells, these biologically-modified nanoparticles enhanced uptake by several fold. In addition to using sugars, we also used metal affinity chromatography chemistry to link Nickel-NTA to the outside of nanoparticles. This not only allowed for conjugation of Histidine-tagged proteins to the outside for temporal delivery, but also allowed for conjugation of cell-specific targeting agents as well. Indeed, when His-VE-Cadherin was used as a model targeting agent, binding and uptake by endothelial cells increased significantly. For cell therapy, incorporation of proper signals to the micoenvironment is critical. One such signal that greatly impacts differentiation is the Notch1 pathway. We were able to immobilize Jagged1, the ligand of Notch1, on to self-assembling peptide nanofibers. Inclusion of this bioactive signal significantly enhanced cardiogenic differentiation. Morever, by including time release nanoparticles, we were able to improve differentiation and survival significantly more, underscoring the need to spatiotemporal control of drug delivery for enhancing cell therapy.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Signaling pathways governing tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is regulated by the highly coordinated function of various proteins with pro- and antiangiogenic functions. Proangiogenic factors include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, transforming growth factor, angiopoietins, and several chemokines; antiangiogenic factors include thrombospondin-1, angiostatin, and endostatin. Matrix metalloproteinases display a dual role in vascular development. Notch signaling affects remodeling of the primary vascular network of uniformly sized vessels into functionally and morphologically distinct arteries, veins, and capillaries. Tumors, described as 'wounds that never heal', lose the appropriate balance among these factors.

{"title": "The formation of an angiogenic astrocyte template is regulated by the neuroretina in a HIF-1-dependent manner.", "abstract": "The vascular and nervous systems display a high degree of cross-talk and depend on each other functionally. In the vascularization of the central nervous system, astrocytes have been thought to sense tissue oxygen levels in hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)-dependent manner and control the vascular growth into the hypoxic area by secreting VEGF. However, recent genetic evidences demonstrate that not only astrocyte HIFs but also astrocyte VEGF expression is dispensable for developmental angiogenesis of the retina. This study demonstrates that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF-1\u03b1), a key transcription factor involved in cellular responses to hypoxia, is most abundantly expressed in the neuroretina, especially retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). A neuroretina-specific knockout of HIF-1\u03b1 (\u03b1Cre(+)Hif1\u03b1(flox/flox)) showed impaired vascular development characterized by decreased tip cell filopodia and reduced vessel branching. The astrocyte network was hypoplastic in \u03b1Cre(+)Hif1\u03b1(flox/flox) mice. Mechanistically, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A), a mitogen for astrocytes, was downregulated in the neuroretina of \u03b1Cre(+)Hif1\u03b1(flox/flox) mice. Supplementing PDGF-A restored reduced astrocytic and vascular density in \u03b1Cre(+)Hif1\u03b1(flox/flox) mice.

{"title": "Folic acid improves inner ear vascularization in hyperhomocysteinemic mice.", "abstract": "More than 29 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with hearing loss. Interestingly, elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), are also associated with impaired hearing. However, the associated mechanism remains obscure. The collagen receptor such as discoidin domain receptor 1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) play a significant role in inner ear structure and function. We hypothesize that HHcy increases hearing thresholds by compromise in inner ear vasculature resulted from impaired Hcy metabolism, increased oxidative stress, collagen IVa and collagen Ia turnover. The treatment with folic acid (FA) protects elevated hearing thresholds and prevents reduction in vessel density by lowering abundant collagen deposition and oxidative stress in inner ear. To test this hypothesis we employed 8 weeks old male wild type (WT), cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice, WT + FA (0.0057 \u03bcg/g/day, equivalent to a 400 \u03bcg/70 kg/day human dose in drinking water); and CBS(+/-) +FA. The mice were treated for four weeks. The hearing thresholds were determined by recording the auditory brainstem responses. Integrity of vessels was analyzed by perfusion of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracer. Endothelial permeability was assessed, which indicated restoration of HRP leakage by FA treatment. A total Hcy level was increased in stria vascularis (SV) and spiral ligament (SL) of CBS+/- mice which was lowered by FA. Interestingly, FA treatment lowered Col IVa Immunostaining by affecting its turnover. The levels of MMP-2, -9, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathione gamma lyase (CSE) were measured by Western blot analysis. The oxidative stress was high in SV and SL of CBS+/- compared to WT however the treatment with FA lowered oxidative stress in CBS+/- mice. These data suggested that hearing loss in CBS+/- mice was primarily due to leakage in inner ear circulation, also partly by induced collagen imbalance, increase in Hcy and oxidative stress in inner ear.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2012-01-10", "authors": ["SoumiKundu", "CharuMunjal", "NeetuTyagi", "UtpalSen", "Aaron CTyagi", "Suresh CTyagi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2011.12.006"}

{"title": "Tracking hypoxic signaling within encapsulated cell aggregates.", "abstract": "In Diabetes mellitus type 1, autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic \u03b2-cells results in loss of insulin production and potentially lethal hyperglycemia. As an alternative treatment option to exogenous insulin injection, transplantation of functional pancreatic tissue has been explored. This approach offers the promise of a more natural, long-term restoration of normoglycemia. Protection of the donor tissue from the host's immune system is required to prevent rejection and encapsulation is a method used to help achieve this aim. Biologically-derived materials, such as alginate and agarose, have been the traditional choice for capsule construction but may induce inflammation or fibrotic overgrowth which can impede nutrient and oxygen transport. Alternatively, synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels are non-degrading, easily functionalized, available at high purity, have controllable pore size, and are extremely biocompatible. As an additional benefit, PEG hydrogels may be formed rapidly in a simple photo-crosslinking reaction that does not require application of non-physiological temperatures. Such a procedure is described here. In the crosslinking reaction, UV degradation of the photoinitiator, 1-[4-(2-Hydroxyethoxy)-phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propane-1-one (Irgacure 2959), produces free radicals which attack the vinyl carbon-carbon double bonds of dimethacrylated PEG (PEGDM) inducing crosslinking at the chain ends. Crosslinking can be achieved within 10 minutes. PEG hydrogels constructed in such a manner have been shown to favorably support cells, and the low photoinitiator concentration and brief exposure to UV irradiation is not detrimental to viability and function of the encapsulated tissue. While we methacrylate our PEG with the method described below, PEGDM can also be directly purchased from vendors such as Sigma. An inherent consequence of encapsulation is isolation of the cells from a vascular network. Supply of nutrients, notably oxygen, is therefore reduced and limited by diffusion. This reduced oxygen availability may especially impact \u03b2-cells whose insulin secretory function is highly dependent on oxygen. Capsule composition and geometry will also impact diffusion rates and lengths for oxygen. Therefore, we also describe a technique for identifying hypoxic cells within our PEG capsules. Infection of the cells with a recombinant adenovirus allows for a fluorescent signal to be produced when intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways are activated. As HIFs are the primary regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia, they represent an ideal target marker for detection of hypoxic signaling. This approach allows for easy and rapid detection of hypoxic cells. Briefly, the adenovirus has the sequence for a red fluorescent protein (Ds Red DR from Clontech) under the control of a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) trimer. Stabilization of HIF-1 by low oxygen conditions will drive transcription of the fluorescent protein (Figure 1). Additional details on the construction of this virus have been published previously. The virus is stored in 10% glycerol at -80\u00b0 C as many 150 \u03bcL aliquots in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes at a concentration of 3.4 x 10(10) pfu/mL. Previous studies in our lab have shown that MIN6 cells encapsulated as aggregates maintain their viability throughout 4 weeks of culture in 20% oxygen. MIN6 aggregates cultured at 2 or 1% oxygen showed both signs of necrotic cells (still about 85-90% viable) by staining with ethidium bromide as well as morphological changes relative to cells in 20% oxygen. The smooth spherical shape of the aggregates displayed at 20% was lost and aggregates appeared more like disorganized groups of cells. While the low oxygen stress does not cause a pronounced drop in viability, it is clearly impacting MIN6 aggregation and function as measured by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Western blot analysis of encapsulated cells in 20% and 1% oxygen also showed a significant increase in HIF-1\u03b1 for cells cultured in the low oxygen conditions which correlates with the expression of the DsRed DR protein.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-01-05", "authors": ["Matthew LSkiles", "SuchitSahai", "James OBlanchette"], "doi": "10.3791/3521"}

Optical imaging was performed by optical tomography (3D) and 2D reflectance imaging (control, n = 7; therapy, n = 6). Accumulation of the radioactive tracer was determined ex vivo (control, n = 5; therapy, n = 6). Tumor vascularization was investigated with an optical blood pool marker (study part I) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (both studies). Data were validated by immunohistology.\nA significantly higher apoptosis rate was detected in treated tumors by immunohistological terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining (area fraction: control, 0.023 \u00b1 0.015%; therapy, 0.387 \u00b1 0.105%; P < 0.001). However, both 2D reflectance imaging using Annexin Vivo (control, 13 \u00b1 15 FI/cm2; therapy, 11 \u00b1 7 FI/cm2) and gamma counting using 99 mTc-HYNIC-Annexin V (tumor-to-muscle ratio control, 5.66 \u00b1 1.46; therapy, 6.09 \u00b1 1.40) failed in showing higher accumulation in treated tumors.

{"title": "Cost-effectiveness analysis of free vascularized fibular grafting for osteonecrosis of the femoral head.", "abstract": "Management of symptomatic pre-collapse osteonecrosis of the femoral head continues to be controversial. Patients are often young and active, therefore hip-preserving procedures such as free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) have been developed to relieve pain and restore function, thereby delaying or preventing the need for joint arthroplasty. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of FVFG to total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the young adult. A Markov decision model was created for a cost-utility analysis of FVFG compared to THA. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness, expressed in QALYs gained, were derived from existing literature. Principal outcome measures included average incremental costs, effectiveness, and net health benefits. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to validate the model. THA resulted in a greater average incremental cost (+$5,933) while at a lower average incremental effectiveness (-0.15 QALY) compared to FVFG. On average, THA gained 22.08 QALYs at a cost-effectiveness (C/E) ratio of $1026/QALY, whereas FVFG gained 22.23 QALYs at a C/E ratio of $752/QALY. Threshold sensitivity analysis determined that the yearly all-cause probability of revision for FVFG would have to be more than three times greater than THA before THA became more cost-effective. Free vascularized fibular grafting is a more cost-effective procedure to treat osteonecrosis in certain populations. Markov decision analysis accounts for the impact of treatment strategies over the lifetime of a patient cohort. These findings can inform clinical decision making in the absence of universally accepted management strategies.", "journal": "Journal of surgical orthopaedic advances", "date": "2012-01-05", "authors": ["Tyler StevenWatters", "James ABrowne", "Lori AOrlando", "Samuel SWellman", "James RUrbaniak", "Michael PBolognesi"], "doi": null}

In this study, we directly made the extracellular matrix of the tissue or organ into scaffold for spinal cord injuries, a strategy that is seldomly tried in spinal cord engineering. The aim of this study was to determine if the chemically extracted acellular muscle could be a potential scaffold for spinal cord injury. The chemically extracted acellular muscle was implanted in the lateral hemisected adult rat thoracic spinal cord. Control rats were similarly injured. After 1 and 4 weeks, scaffold integration and biocompatibility, axon sprouting, and myelination were evaluated. The chemically extracted acellular muscle scaffolds were found to be well integrated with the host tissue. Sprouting axons grew into the full length of the scaffold in a strikingly parallel and linear fashion. A few remyelinated axons were also detected in the scaffolds. The tracing results in another six rats showed that labeled fibers entered the chemically treated muscle grafts. Furthermore, there were no apparent quantitative differences in the ED-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells between groups. Neuron counting showed more surviving neurons in the acellular muscle treated group than those of the injured only group. Vascularization of the grafts was also confirmed.

To improve angiogenesis, we incorporated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in collagen-coating over the porous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds. The release kinetics of loaded VEGF from collagen-coated PCL (col-PCL) scaffolds was same as from scaffolds without the collagen. The bioactivity of VEGF delivered by the col-PCL scaffolds was confirmed by human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The col-PCL scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in mice for 7 and 14 days. At day 7, vascularization within scaffolds loaded with VEGF was superior to that in the scaffolds without VEGF. However, the vessel connectivity to host circulatory system was incomplete and restricted to the scaffold edges. At day 14, blood vessels in scaffolds reached density similar to the subcutaneous tissue and were perfusable throughout the implant thickness. Prewashing the scaffolds with saline to remove the unbound growth factor decreased the initial burst release and sustained the VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in vivo.

{"title": "Molecular pathways: hypoxia response in immune cells fighting or promoting cancer.", "abstract": "Both malignant and stromal components in tumors are influenced by the physiologic conditions of the microenvironment. Hypoxia is a prominent feature of solid tumors as a result of defective vascularization and intense metabolic activity. The gene-expression control mechanisms that adapt tissues to hypoxia are exploited by tumors to promote angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The functions of infiltrating immune cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) and other stromal components are also influenced by a limited O(2) supply. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are the main molecular transcriptional mediators in the hypoxia response. The degradation and activity of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 are tightly controlled by the fine-tuned action of oxygen-sensing prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylase enzymes. Recent evidence indicates that hypoxia can modulate the differentiation and function of T lymphocytes and myeloid cells, skewing their cytokine-production profiles and modifying the expression of costimulatory receptors. This conceivably includes tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Hypoxia not only directly affects tumor-infiltrating leukocytes but also exerts effects on tumor cells and vascular cells that indirectly cause selective chemokine-mediated recruitment of suppressive and proangiogenic T-cell subsets. This review focuses on changes induced by hypoxia in immune cells infiltrating solid malignancies.

Knock-in of the BRAF(V600E) allele into the genome of human epithelial cells triggered their angiogenic response. In cancer cells harboring oncogenic BRAF, the inhibitor PLX4720 switches off the ERK pathway and inhibits the expression of proangiogenic molecules. In tumor xenografts harboring the BRAF(V600E), PLX4720 extensively modifies the vascular network causing abrogation of hypoxia.

{"title": "Promotion of lymphatic integrity by angiopoietin-1/Tie2 signaling during inflammation.", "abstract": "The cutaneous lymphatic system plays a major role in tissue fluid homeostasis and inflammation of the skin. Although several lymphangiogenic factors are known to be involved in the formation of lymphatic vessels, the molecular mechanisms that maintain lymphatic integrity and control the functional drainage of interstitial fluid and resolution of inflammation remain unknown. Here we show that angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) enhances lymphatic integrity and function during inflammation. Ang1 transgenic mice under the control of keratin-14 (K14-Ang1) showed attenuated edema formation and inflammation after UV B (UVB) exposure. After UVB irradiation, blood vascular permeability was inhibited in K14-Ang1 mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, lymphatic vessels of WT mice were markedly enlarged and leaky in inflamed skin, whereas K14-Ang1 mice showed relatively contracted lymphatic vessels together with enhanced lymphatic vascularization. Expression of endothelial-specific tight junction molecules claudin-5 and zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) was strongly down-regulated in the inflamed lymphatic vessels of UVB-exposed WT mice, whereas down-regulation of both claudin-5 and ZO-1 was blocked in UVB-exposed K14-Ang1 mice. In vitro studies revealed that the stability of lymphatic endothelial cells was enhanced in the presence of Ang1, presumably via up-regulation of claudin-5, as well as ZO-1. Claudin-5 knockdown markedly increased the permeability of lymphatic endothelial cells.

We aimed to target cerebral pericytes in vivo using dual gene transcript-targeted MRI (GT-tMRI) in male C57black6 mice after a 60-min bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO).

We demonstrated that the surge in cerebral iron content by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry matched the increase in the frequency of relaxivity.

Phenotypic analysis using wild-type zebrafish larvae revealed BPA early-life exposure toxicity caused cardiac edema, cranio-facial abnormality, failure of swimbladder inflation and poor tactile response. Fluorescent imaging analysis using three transgenic lines revealed suppressed neuron branching from the spinal cord, abnormal development of neuromast cells, and suppressed vascularization in the abdominal region. Using knowledge-based data mining algorithms, transcriptome analysis suggests that several signaling pathways involving ephrin receptor, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, synaptic long-term potentiation, axonal guidance, vascular endothelial growth factor, integrin and tight junction were deregulated. Physiological systems with related disorders associated with the nervous, cardiovascular, skeletal-muscular, blood and reproductive systems were implicated, hence corroborated with the phenotypic analysis. Further analysis identified a common set of BPA-targeted genes and revealed a plausible mechanism involving disruption of endocrine-regulated genes and processes in known susceptible tissue-organs. The expression of 28 genes were validated in a separate experiment using quantitative real-time PCR and 6 genes, ncl1, apoeb, mdm1, mycl1b, sp4, U1SNRNPBP homolog, were found to be sensitive and robust biomarkers for BPA early-life exposure toxicity. The susceptibility of sp4 to BPA perturbation suggests its role in altering brain development, function and subsequently behavior observed in laboratory animals exposed to BPA during early life, which is a health-risk concern of early life exposure in humans. The present study further established zebrafish as a model for toxicogenomic inference of early-life chemical exposure toxicity.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-12-24", "authors": ["Siew HongLam", "Mya MyintzuHlaing", "XiaoyanZhang", "ChuanYan", "ZhenghuaDuan", "LinZhu", "Choong YongUng", "SinnakaruppanMathavan", "Choon NamOng", "ZhiyuanGong"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0028273"}
{"title": "Tumor-Endothelial Cell Three-dimensional Spheroids: New Aspects to Enhance Radiation and Drug Therapeutics.", "abstract": "Classic cancer research for several decades has focused on understanding the biology of tumor cells in vitro. However, extending these findings to in vivo settings has been impeded owing to limited insights on the impact of microenvironment on tumor cells. We hypothesized that tumor cell biology and treatment response would be more informative when done in the presence of stromal components, like endothelial cells, which exist in the tumor microenvironment. To that end, we have developed a system to grow three-dimensional cultures of GFP-4T1 mouse mammary tumor and 2H11 murine endothelial cells in hanging drops of medium in vitro. The presence of 2H11 endothelial cells in these three-dimensional cocultures was found to sensitize 4T1-GFP tumor cells to chemotherapy (Taxol) and, at the same time, protect cells from ionizing radiation. These spheroidal cultures can also be implanted into the dorsal skinfold window chamber of mice for fluorescence imaging of vascularization and disease progression/treatment response. We observed rapid neovascularization of the tumor-endothelial spheroids in comparison to tumor spheroids grown in nude mice. Molecular analysis revealed pronounced up-regulation of several proangiogenic factors in the tumor tissue derived from the tumor-endothelial spheroids compared with tumor-only spheroids. Furthermore, the rate of tumor growth from tumor-endothelial spheroids in mice was faster than the tumor cell-only spheroids, resulting in greater metastasis to the lung. This three-dimensional coculture model presents an improved way to investigate more pertinent aspects of the therapeutic potential for radiation and/or chemotherapy alone and in combination with antiangiogenic agents.", "journal": "Translational oncology", "date": "2011-12-23", "authors": ["MeenakshiUpreti", "AzematJamshidi-Parsian", "Nathan AKoonce", "Jessica SWebber", "Sunil KSharma", "Alexzander AaAsea", "Mathew JMader", "Robert JGriffin"], "doi": "10.1593/tlo.11187\n10.1101/pdb.prot5452"}

The PK profile was evaluated at 0.1-5 mg\u00b7kg(-1) IV using unlabeled or [(14)C]-labeled peginesatide. Mass balance, tissue distribution and metabolism were evaluated following IV administration of 5 mg\u00b7kg(-1) [(14)C]-peginesatide, with tissue distribution also evaluated by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) following an IV dose of 17 mg\u00b7kg(-1) [(14)C]-peginesatide. Plasma clearance was slow and elimination was biphasic with unchanged peginesatide representing >90% of the total radioactivity of the total radioactive exposure. Slow uptake of the radiolabeled compound from the vascular compartment into the tissues was observed. Biodistribution to bone marrow and extramedullary hematopoietic sites, and to highly vascularized lymphatic and excretory tissues occurred. A predominant degradation event to occur in vivo was the loss of one PEG chain from the branched PEG moiety to generate mono-PEG. Renal excretion was the primary mechanism (41%) of elimination, with parent molecule (67%) the major moiety excreted. In conclusion, elimination of [(14)C]-peginesatide-derived radioactivity was extended, retention preferentially occurred at sites of erythropoiesis (bone marrow), and urinary excretion was the primary elimination route.", "journal": "Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems", "date": "2011-12-23", "authors": ["Kathryn WWoodburn", "Christopher PHolmes", "Susan DWilson", "Kei-LaiFong", "Randall JPress", "YuuMoriya", "YoshihikoTagawa"], "doi": "10.3109/00498254.2011.649310"}

The cytokine interleukin-17A supports tumour vascularization and growth, however, its role in lung cancer is unknown. Here we show, in the lungs of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, an increase in interleukin-17A that is inversely correlated with the expression of T-bet and correlated with the T regulatory cell transcription factor Foxp3. Local targeting of interleukin-17A in experimental lung adenocarcinoma results in a reduction in tumour load, local expansion of interferon-\u03b3-producing CD4(+) T cells and a reduction in lung CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. T-bet((-/-)) mice have a significantly higher tumour load compared with wild-type mice. This is associated with the local upregulation of interleukin-23 and induction of interleukin-17A/interleukin-17R-expressing T cells infiltrating the tumour.

Stained corrosion casts of the microvasculature network guarantee superior X-ray absorption contrast and highest reproduction fidelity. Tomography of a centimeter-size tumor, however, is unfeasible at the spatial resolution needed to reveal the smallest vessels. Therefore, local tomography has been performed to visualize the smallest capillaries within the region of interest. These three-dimensional data show the detailed morphology, but the reconstructed absorption coefficients obtained in local tomography differ substantially from the absorption coefficients retrieved from the less detailed global tomography data. This paper deals with the adaptation of local tomography data using the global data and considers two-parameter histogram matching of the radiographs, sinogram extension, and multi-parameter cupping correction. It is demonstrated that two-parameter histogram matching of the radiographs already provides reasonable agreement. The change of the lens in front of the detector's camera, however, significantly affects the obtained local X-ray absorption coefficients in the tomograms predominantly owing to the dissimilar point-spread functions of the two configurations used, and much less to the fact that one of the data sets was acquired in a local geometry.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2011-12-22", "authors": ["SabrinaLang", "MarcoDominietto", "PhilippeCattin", "AlexandraUlmann-Schuler", "TimmWeitkamp", "BertM\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.1107/S0909049511046139"}

The present study explored the effect of abrogation of the p40 subunit, which is shared by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, on wound closure of excisional oral mucosal wounds.\nDouble IL-12 and IL-23 KO mice and C57BL \u2044 6J wildtype mice were wounded on the dorsal surface of the tongue using a 2 mm biopsy punch. The degree of epithelialization was examined histologically. At specific timepoints wounds were examined for cellular and molecular markers for inflammation and angiogenesis using 1) immunohistochemistry; 2) analysis of RNA expression; and 3) flow cytometric analysis.\nCompared to wild type controls, KO mice displayed enhanced healing, which was driven by a greater influx of neutrophils and macrophages during the early stages of wound healing, and increased induction of messenger RNA (mRNA) for endothelial derived neutrophil attractant (ENA78) chemokine and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 alpha (MIP-2\u03b1). Increased mRNA for monocyte-attracting chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and MCP-3 was seen from day 1, together with higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 within 24 hours after wounding. In addition, mRNA for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A was upregulated in KO mice within 2 hours after injury, and higher expression of this mediator was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\nOverall, the accelerated oral mucosal wound healing seen in IL-12/IL-23p40 KO compared to wildtype mice was associated with the early establishment of an inflammatory response and vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of inflammation (London, England)", "date": "2011-12-22", "authors": ["Marie AtMatias", "Jodi MSaunus", "SasoIvanovski", "Laurence JWalsh", "Camile SFarah"], "doi": "10.1186/1476-9255-8-39\n10.1006/jsre.1998.5495\n10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00396-8\n10.1186/gb-2005-6-4-p5\n10.1096/fj.00-0073com\n10.1096/fj.01-0776com\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.060370\n10.1172/JCI117528\n10.1016/S1074-7613(03)00296-6\n10.1164/rccm.200512-1886OC\n10.1111/j.2041-1014.2010.00570.x\n10.1093/jnci/87.8.581\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3134\n10.1084/jem.182.1.219\n10.1002/eji.1830250133\n10.1084/jem.20052545\n10.1038/nature04808\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80413-6\n10.1038/jid.2009.65\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61717-8\n10.1172/JCI1020\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2000.00029.x\n10.1002/1096-9896(200108)194:4<393::AID-PATH907>3.0.CO;2-7\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65699-4\n10.1016/j.it.2004.02.006\n10.1016/S0379-0738(00)00218-8\n10.1002/dvdy.10064\n10.1006/cyto.1996.0074\n10.1074/jbc.271.46.29393\n10.1016/0006-291X(92)92277-5\n10.1038/sj.onc.1201033\n10.1006/jsre.2002.6444\n10.1097/00000637-198508000-00004\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19981029)78:3<361::AID-IJC17>3.0.CO;2-9\n10.1038/35074588\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.596452\n10.1189/jlb.1107753\n10.1111/j.1529-8019.2010.01303.x"}

The main cell type of KS tumors is the spindle cell, a cell of endothelial origin, the primary cell type involved in angiogenesis. Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of KS and is likely involved in both tumor formation and the induction of angiogenesis. Integrins, and specifically integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, have known roles in both tumor induction and angiogenesis. \u03b1V\u03b23 is also important for KSHV infection as it has been shown to be involved in KSHV entry into cells. We found that during latent infection of endothelial cells KSHV induces the expression of integrin \u03b23 leading to increased surface levels of \u03b1V\u03b23. Signaling molecules downstream of integrins, including FAK and Src, are activated during viral latency. Integrin activation by KSHV is necessary for the KSHV-associated upregulation of a number of angiogenic phenotypes during latent infection including adhesion and motility. Additionally, KSHV-infected cells become more reliant on \u03b1V\u03b23 for capillary like formation in three dimensional culture.

{"title": "Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nfe2) regulates JunD DNA-binding activity via acetylation: a novel mechanism regulating trophoblast differentiation.", "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that the bZip transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nfe2) represses protein acetylation and expression of the transcription factor glial cell missing 1 (Gcm1) in trophoblast cells, preventing excess syncytiotrophoblast formation and permitting normal placental vascularization and embryonic growth. However, the Gcm1 promoter lacks a Nfe2-binding site and hence the mechanisms linking Nfe2 and Gcm1 expression remained unknown. Here we show that Nfe2 represses JunD DNA-binding activity to the Gcm1 promoter during syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. Interventional studies using knockdown and knockin approaches show that enhanced JunD DNA-binding activity is required for increased expression of Gcm1 and syncytiotrophoblast formation as well as impaired placental vascularization and reduced growth of Nfe2(-/-) embryos. Induction of Gcm1 expression requires binding of JunD to the -1441 site within the Gcm1 promoter, which is distinct from the -1314 site previously shown to induce Gcm1 expression by other bZip transcription factors. Nfe2 modulates JunD binding to the Gcm1 promoter via acetylation, as reducing JunD acetylation using the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor curcumin reverses the increased JunD DNA-binding activity observed in the absence of Nfe2. This identifies a novel mechanism through which bZip transcription factors interact.

We report our 20-year experience using CC7 transfer for BPI, all of which had at least 4 years of follow-up.\nA total of 137 adult BPI patients underwent CC7 transfer from 1989 to 2006. Of these patients, 101 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this study. A single surgeon performed all surgeries. A vascularized ulnar nerve graft, either pedicled or free, was used for CC7 elongation. The vascularized ulnar nerve graft was transferred to the median nerve (group 1, 1 target) in 55 patients, and to the median and musculocutaneous nerves (group 2, 2 targets) in 23 patients. In another 23 patients (group 3, 2 targets, 2 stages), the CC7 was transferred to the median nerve (17 patients) or to the median and musculocutaneous nerve (6 patients) during the first stage, followed by functioning free muscle transplantation for finger flexion.\nWe considered finger flexion strength greater or equal to M3 to be a successful functional result. Success rates of CC7 transfer were 55%, 39%, and 74% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In addition, the success rate for recovery of elbow flexion (strength M3 or better) in group 2 was 83%.\nIn reconstruction of total brachial plexus root avulsion, the best option may be to adopt the technique of using CC7 transfer to the musculocutaneous and median nerve, followed by FFMT in the early stage (18 mo or less) for finger flexion. Such a technique can potentially improve motor recovery of elbow and finger flexion in a shorter rehabilitation period (3 to 4 y) and, more importantly, provide finger sensation to the completely paralytic limb.\nTherapeutic II.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "date": "2011-12-17", "authors": ["David Chwei-ChinChuang", "CatherineHernon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhsa.2011.10.014"}

A gene-enhanced tissue engineering represents a promising approach for vascularization. Our previous study indicated that hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) can up-regulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The angiogenesis is a co-ordinated process that requires the participation of multiple angiogenic factors. To further explore the angiogenic effect of HIF-1\u03b1 mediated stem cells, in this study, we systematically evaluated the function of HIF-1\u03b1 in enhancing BMSCs angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. A constitutively active form of HIF-1\u03b1 (CA5) was inserted into a lentivirus vector and transduced into BMSCs, and its effect on vascularization and vascular remodeling was further evaluated in a rat critical-sized calvarial defects model with a gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold. The expression of the key angiogenic factors including VEGF, SDF-1, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PLGF), angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1), and stem cell factor (SCF) at both mRNAs and proteins levels in BMSCs were significantly enhanced by HIF-1\u03b1 overexpression compared to the in vitro control group. In addition, HIF-1\u03b1-over expressing BMSCs showed dramatically improved blood vessel formation in the tissue-engineered bone as analyzed by photography of specimen, micro-CT, and histology. These data confirm the important role of HIF-1\u03b1 in angiogenesis in tissue-engineered bone.

{"title": "Design concepts and strategies for tissue engineering scaffolds.", "abstract": "In the emerging field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, new viable and functional tissue is fabricated from living cells cultured on an artificial matrix in a simulated biological environment. It is evident that the specific requirements for the three main components, cells, scaffold materials, and the culture environment, are very different, depending on the type of cells and the organ-specific application. Identifying the variables within each of these components is a complex and challenging assignment, but there do exist general requirements for designing and fabricating tissue engineering scaffolds. Therefore, this review explores one of the three main components, namely, the key concepts, important parameters, and required characteristics related to the development and evaluation of tissue engineering scaffolds. An array of different design strategies will be discussed, which include mimicking the extra cellular matrix, responding to the need for mass transport, predicting the structural architecture, ensuring adequate initial mechanical integrity, modifying the surface chemistry and topography to provide cell signaling, and anticipating the material selection so as to predict the required rate of bioresorption.

Both fibroblast-rich tissues have high vascularity, and tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with osteoarthritis (OA) demonstrates conversion of androgenic prehormones to downstream estrogens. We undertook this study to investigate similarities between proliferating pannus and placental tissue by focusing on angiogenic placenta growth factor 1 (PlGF-1) in patients with OA and patients with RA.\nWe used immunohistochemistry to study the presence of PlGF-1, its synovial distribution, and the PlGF-1-expressing synovial cell type. The relationship between PlGF-1 and conversion of the biologically inactive placental prehormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) to the biologically active dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was investigated in mixed synovial cells. The effects of DHEA on PlGF-1 expression were studied by intracellular fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.\nPlGF-1-positive cells were detected in the lining and sublining areas in patients with RA and patients with OA, and cellular density was similar. Double staining revealed that PlGF-1-positive cells were macrophages. In RA and OA, the density of PlGF-1-positive cells correlated positively with the density of macrophages and the density of type IV collagen-positive vessels. The supernatant concentration of (3) H-DHEA after conversion from (3) H-DHEAS and the density of aromatase-positive cells were positively correlated with the density of PlGF-1-positive cells only in OA.

Saline, cbMSC bodies and HUVEC bodies were used as controls. In vitro results indicated that cbMSC/HUVEC bodies possessed the capability of heterotypic assembly of cbMSCs and HUVECs into robust and durable tubular networks on Matrigel. The up-regulated gene expressions of VEGF and IGF-1 reflected the robust expansion of tubular networks; in addition, the augmented levels of SMA and SM22 suggested smooth muscle differentiation of cbMSCs, possibly helping to improve the durability of networks. Moreover, according to the in vivo echocardiographic, magnetic resonance and computed-tomographic results, transplantation of cbMSC/HUVEC bodies benefited post-MI dysfunction. Furthermore, the vascularization analyses demonstrated the robust vasculogenic potential of cbMSC/HUVEC bodies in vivo, thus contributing to the greater viable myocardium and the less scar region, and ultimately restoring the cardiac function.

Tissue engineered grafts can also be used as high fidelity models to probe cellular and molecular interactions underlying developmental processes. In this study, we co-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under various environmental conditions to elicit synergistic interactions leading to the colocalized development of capillary-like and bone-like tissues. Cells were encapsulated at the 1:1 ratio in fibrin gel to screen compositions of endothelial growth medium (EGM) and osteogenic medium (OM). It was determined that, to form both tissues, co-cultures should first be supplied with EGM followed by a 1:1 cocktail of the two media types containing bone morphogenetic protein-2. Subsequent studies of HUVECs and MSCs cultured in decellularized, trabecular bone scaffolds for 6 weeks assessed the effects on tissue construct of both temporal variations in growth-factor availability and addition of fresh cells. The resulting grafts were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice to determine the phenotype stability and functionality of engineered vessels. Two important findings resulted from these studies: (i) vascular development needs to be induced prior to osteogenesis, and (ii) the addition of additional hMSCs at the osteogenic induction stage improves both tissue outcomes, as shown by increased bone volume fraction, osteoid deposition, close proximity of bone proteins to vascular networks, and anastomosis of vascular networks with the host vasculature.

{"title": "Challenges posed to the maternal circulation by pregnancy.", "abstract": "In primates, adequate growth of the fetus depends on the development of the uteroplacental unit. On the fetal side, this is achieved by the creation of the vascular network of the placenta. On the maternal side, the transformation of the spiral arteries into saccular nonreactive vessels by the trophoblast provides high blood flow to the intervillous space. Apart from the changes in the uterine arteries, the mother expands her plasma volume - at the expense of stimulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system - and her cardiac output. In the maintaining of normotension in the face of an increased cardiac output and plasma volume, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system requires an enhanced vasodilator synthesis. Finally, in the late stages of pregnancy, a normal endothelial function is required to provide an ample margin to the activation provoked by deportation of syncytiotrophoblast fragments/factors to the maternal circulation. These four adaptative processes require various interrelated vasodilator systems. Deficient adaptations cause isolated or proteinuric arterial hypertension, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirths, among others. Moreover, a normal or a defective adaptation to pregnancy influences maternal cardiovascular health in later life, as evidenced by various studies, most of them epidemiological; thus, pregnancy is now considered a stress test to the maternal cardiovascular system. Because of this, women planning to become pregnant should be screened for clinical and biochemical cardiovascular risks. Inversely, women presenting with hypertension in pregnancy should be thoroughly studied to detect and correct cardiovascular risks.

{"title": "Depth dependence of vascular fluorescence imaging.", "abstract": "In vivo surface imaging of fluorescently labeled vasculature has become a widely used tool for functional brain imaging studies. Techniques such as phosphorescence quenching for oxygen tension measurements and indocyanine green fluorescence for vessel perfusion monitoring rely on surface measurements of vascular fluorescence. However, the depth dependence of the measured fluorescence signals has not been modeled in great detail. In this paper, we investigate the depth dependence of the measured signals using a three-dimensional Monte Carlo model combined with high resolution vascular anatomy. We found that a bulk-vascularization assumption to modeling the depth dependence of the signal does not provide an accurate picture of penetration depth of the collected fluorescence signal in most cases. Instead the physical distribution of microvasculature, the degree of absorption difference between extravascular and intravascular space, and the overall difference in absorption at the excitation and emission wavelengths must be taken into account to determine the depth penetration of the fluorescence signal. Additionally, we found that using targeted illumination can provide for superior surface vessel sensitivity over wide-field illumination, with small area detection offering an even greater amount of sensitivity to surface vasculature.

{"title": "Tissue engineering based on electrochemical desorption of an RGD-containing oligopeptide.", "abstract": "This paper describes a non-invasive approach for efficient detachment of cells adhered to a gold substrate via a specific oligopeptide. Detachment is effected by an electrical stimulus. The oligopeptide contains cysteine, which spontaneously forms a gold-thiolate bond on a gold surface. This chemical adsorption reaches > 95% equilibrium within 10 min after immersion of a gold-coated substrate in a solution containing the peptide. The peptide is reversibly desorbed from the surface within 5 min of application of a negative electrical potential. By taking advantage of this simple adsorption and desorption mechanism, cells can be grown on an oligopeptide-functionalized gold surface and can be efficiently detached as single cells or cell sheets by application of a negative electrical potential. This approach was also applied to the surface of gold-coated microrods. Capillary-like microchannels were formed in collagen gel by transferring endothelial cells to the internal surfaces of the microchannels. During subsequent perfusion culture, the enveloped endothelial cells migrated into the collagen gel and formed luminal structures, which sprouted from the microchannels. This technique has the potential to provide a fundamental tool for the engineering of thick cell sheets as well as vascularized tissues and organs.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["NaotoMochizuki", "TakahiroKakegawa", "TatsuyaOsaki", "NasserSadr", "Nezamoddin NKachouie", "HiroakiSuzuki", "JunjiFukuda"], "doi": "10.1002/term.519"}

To facilitate proangiogenic outcomes and promote tissue growth, an elastomeric scaffold previously shown to be instrumental in the urinary bladder regenerative process was modified to release proangiogenic growth factors. Carboxylic acid groups on poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) films (POCfs) were modified with heparan sulfate creating a heparan binding POCf (HBPOCf). Release of proangiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) from HBPOCfs demonstrated an approximate threefold increase over controls during a 30-day time course in vitro. Atomic force microscopy demonstrated significant topological differences between films. Subcutaneous implantation of POCf alone, HBPOCf, POCf-VEGF, and HBPOCf-VEGF within the dorsa of nude rats yielded increased vascular growth in HBPOCf-VEGF constructs. Vessel quantification studies revealed that POCfs alone contained 41.1 \u00b1 4.1 vessels/mm\u00b2, while HBPOCf, POCf-VEGF, and HBPOCF-VEGF contained 41.7 \u00b1 2.6, 76.3 \u00b1 9.4, and 167.72 \u00b1 15.3 vessels/mm\u00b2, respectively.

TNF-\u03b1 is implicated in the processes of tumor growth, survival, differentiation, invasion, metastases, secretion of cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors. We have shown that TNFR2/p75 signaling promotes ischemia-induced angiogenesis via modulation of several angiogenic growth factors. We hypothesized that TNFR2/p75 may promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. Growth of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) and/or mouse melanoma B16 cell was evaluated in wild type (WT), p75 knockout (KO) and double p55KO/p75KO mouse tumor xenograft models. Compared with WT and p55KO/p75KO mice, growth of tumors in p75KO mice was significantly decreased (twofold) in both LLC and B16 tumors. Tumor growth inhibition was correlated with decreases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and capillary density, as well as bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells incorporation into the functional capillary network, and an increase in apoptotic cells in LLC xenografts. Gene array analysis of tumor tissues showed a decrease in gene expression in pathways that promote tumor angiogenesis and cell survival. Blocking p75 by short-hairpin RNA in cultured LLCs led to increases in TNF-mediated apoptosis, as well as decreases in the constitutive and TNF-mediated expression of angiogenic growth factors (VEGF, HGF, PLGF), and SDF-1\u03b1 receptor CXCR4. In summary, p75 is essential for tumor angiogenesis and survival in highly vascularized murine lung tumor xenografts. Blocking p75 expression may lead to tumor regression.

Due to the similar anatomy of the mammary gland in both species, the dog has become an important animal model for this cancer entity. In human breast carcinomas, the overexpression of a protein named high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was reported. Cells of the immune system were described to release HMGB1 actively exerting cytokine function. Thereby it is involved in the immune system activation, tissue repair, and cell migration. Passive release of HMGB1 by necrotic cells at sites of tissue damage or in necrotic hypoxic regions of tumors induces cellular responses e.g. release of proinflammatory cytokines leading to elevated inflammatory response and neo-vascularization of necrotic tumor areas. Herein we investigated if a time-dependent stimulation with the separately applied proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 can cause secretion of HMGB1 in a non-immune related HMGB1-non-secreting epithelial canine mammary cell line (MTH53A) derived from non-neoplastic tissue.\nThe canine cell line was transfected with recombinant HMGB1 bicistronic expression vectors and stimulated after transfection with the respective cytokine independently for 6, 24 and 48 h. HMGB1 protein detection was performed by Western blot analysis and quantified a by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Live cell laser scanning multiphoton microscopy of MTH53A cells expressing a HMGB1-GFP fusion protein was performed in order to examine, if secretion of HMGB1 under cytokine stimulating conditions is also visible by fluorescence imaging.\nThe observed HMGB1 release kinetics showed a clearly time-dependent manner with a peak release 24h after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, while stimulation with IFN-\u03b3 had only small effects on the HMGB1 release. Multiphoton HMGB1 live cell microscopy showed diffuse cell membrane structure changes 29 h after cytokine-stimulation but no clear secretion of HMGB1-GFP after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation was visible.\nOur results demonstrate that non-immune HMGB1-non-secreting cells of epithelial origin derived from mammary non-neoplastic tissue can be induced to release HMGB1 by single cytokine application.

The aim of the present investigation was to characterize the mammary adipose phenotype from Brca1 mutant mice in the expectation that this would shed light on the role of the mammary tissue environment in the early stages of breast tumorigenesis. We observed that histological sections of mammary tissue from adult Brca1 mutant mice abnormally display small, multilocular adipocytes that are reminiscent of brown adipose tissue (BAT) as compared to wildtype mice. Using a marker for BAT, the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), we demonstrated that these multilocular adipose regions in Brca1 mutant mice stain positive for UCP1. Transcriptionally, UCP1 mRNA levels in the Brca1 mutant mice were elevated greater than 50-fold compared to age-matched mammary glands from wildtype mice. Indeed, BAT has characteristics that are favorable for tumor growth, including high vascularity. Therefore, we also demonstrated that the multilocular brown adipose phenotype in the mammary fat pad of Brca1 mutant mice displayed regions of increased vascularity as evidenced by a significant increase in the protein expression of CD31, a marker for angiogenesis.

The Sca-1+ cell population was observed distributed in the epidermis, hair follicle bulges, and tumor capsule. The CD146+ population was found distributed within the tumor, mainly associated with blood vessels in a perivascular location. In addition to a perivascular distribution, CD146+ cells expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, lacked expression of endothelial markers CD31 and CD34, and were therefore identified as pericytes. Pericytes were found to be associated with CD31+ endothelial cells; however, some pericytes were also observed associated with CD31-, MART-1+ B16 melanoma cells that appeared to form blood vessel structures. Furthermore, the authors observed extensive nuclear expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in melanoma and stroma cells, suggesting hypoxia is an important factor associated with the melanoma microenvironment and vascularization.

Bovine cartilage explants were treated with hyaluronidase to deplete GAG content and then seeded with fluorescently tagged human endothelial cells (HMEC-1). HMEC-1 adherence was assessed after 4 hr and 7 days. The effect of hyaluronidase treatment on GAG content, chondrocyte viability, and biochemical composition of the extracellular matrix was also determined. Hyaluronidase treatment reduced the GAG content of cartilage explants by 78 \u00b1 3% compared with that of controls (p < 0.0001). GAG depletion was associated with significantly more HMEC-1 adherence on both the surface (superficial zone) and the underside (deep zone) of the explants (both p < 0.0001). The latter provided a more favorable environment for extended culture of HMEC-1 compared with the articulating surface. Hyaluronidase treatment altered the immunostaining for chondroitin sulfate epitopes, but not for lubricin.

Furthermore, fisetin inhibited capillary-like tube formation on Matrigel (up to 85%, P < 0.001) as well as migration (up to 66%, P < 0.001), which were associated with decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and VEGF in HUVEC. It also decreased the expression of eNOS, VEGF, inducible nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in A549 and DU145 human cancer cells. In vivo matrigel plug assay in mice showed significant decrease in size (up to 43%, P < 0.001), vascularization and hemoglobin content (up to 94%, P < 0.001) in the plugs from fisetin-treated, compared with control mice.

One example of this is the extensive angiogenesis that is a typical feature of high-grade gliomas. Here, we show that expression of the constitutively active mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, \u0394EGFR (EGFRvIII, EGFR*, de2-7EGFR) is associated with significantly higher expression levels of the pro-angiogenic factor interleukin (IL)-8 in human glioma specimens and glioma stem cells. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of \u0394EGFR in different glioma cell lines caused up to 60-fold increases in the secretion of IL-8. Xenografts of these cells exhibit increased neovascularization, which is not elicited by cells overexpressing wild-type (wt)EGFR or \u0394EGFR with an additional kinase domain mutation. Analysis of the regulation of IL-8 by site-directed mutagenesis of its promoter showed that \u0394EGFR regulates its expression through the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, activator protein 1 (AP-1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). Glioma cells overexpressing \u0394EGFR showed constitutive activation and DNA binding of NF-\u03baB, overexpression of c-Jun and activation of its upstream kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and overexpression of C/EBP\u03b2. Selective pharmacological or genetic targeting of the NF-\u03baB or AP-1 pathways efficiently blocked promoter activity and secretion of IL-8. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated knock-down of either IL-8 or the NF-\u03baB subunit p65, in \u0394EGFR-expressing cells attenuated their ability to form tumors and to induce angiogenesis when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. On the contrary, the overexpression of IL-8 in glioma cells lacking \u0394EGFR potently enhanced their tumorigenicity and produced highly vascularized tumors, suggesting the importance of this cytokine and its transcription regulators in promoting glioma angiogenesis and tumor growth.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-12-06", "authors": ["RBonavia", "M MInda", "SVandenberg", "S-YCheng", "MNagane", "PHadwiger", "PTan", "D W YSah", "W KCavenee", "F BFurnari"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.563"}

However, EOS was found to be noncytotoxic to colon cancer and endothelial cells. In vitro, EOS significantly inhibited the migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). EOS suppressed VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 in HUVECs.

{"title": "A dynamic magnetic shift method to increase nanoparticle concentration in cancer metastases: a feasibility study using simulations on autopsy specimens.", "abstract": "A nanoparticle delivery system termed dynamic magnetic shift (DMS) has the potential to more effectively treat metastatic cancer by equilibrating therapeutic magnetic nanoparticles throughout tumors. To evaluate the feasibility of DMS, histological liver sections from autopsy cases of women who died from breast neoplasms were studied to measure vessel number, size, and spatial distribution in both metastatic tumors and normal tissue. Consistent with prior studies, normal tissue had a higher vascular density with a vessel-to-nuclei ratio of 0.48 \u00b1 0.14 (n = 1000), whereas tumor tissue had a ratio of 0.13 \u00b1 0.07 (n = 1000). For tumors, distances from cells to their nearest blood vessel were larger (average 43.8 \u03bcm, maximum 287 \u03bcm, n \u2248 5500) than normal cells (average 5.3 \u03bcm, maximum 67.8 \u03bcm, n \u2248 5500), implying that systemically delivered nanoparticles diffusing from vessels into surrounding tissue would preferentially dose healthy instead of cancerous cells. Numerical simulations of magnetically driven particle transport based on the autopsy data indicate that DMS would correct the problem by increasing nanoparticle levels in hypovascular regions of metastases to that of normal tissue, elevating the time-averaged concentration delivered to the tumor for magnetic actuation versus diffusion alone by 1.86-fold, and increasing the maximum concentration over time by 1.89-fold.

By creating a new Flk1/Pax3 double reporter mouse line, we have established the precise timetable for angioblast and myoblast delamination/migration from the somite to the limb bud. This timetable was conserved when mouse PSM was grafted into a chicken host, which further validates the experimental model. The use of Pax3(GFP/GFP) knockout mice showed that establishment of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is not compromised by the absence of Pax3. Of note, Pax3(GFP/GFP) knockout mouse PSM-derived cells can contribute to aortic, but not to limb, SMCs that are derived from the somatopleure.

{"title": "Functional resurfacing of the palm: flap selection based on defect analysis.", "abstract": "Extensive defect coverage of the palm and anatomical reconstruction of its unique functional capacity remains difficult. In manual laborers, reconstruction of sensation, range of motion, grip strength but also mechanical stability is required. Sensate musculo-/fasciocutaneous flaps bear disadvantages of tissue mobility with shifting/bulkiness under stress. Thin muscle and fascial flaps show adherence but preclude sensory nerve coaptation. The purpose of this review is to present our algorithm for reliable selection of the most appropriate procedure based on defect analysis. Defect analysis focusing on units of tactile gnosis provides information to weigh needs for sensation or soft tissue stability. We distinguish radial unit (r)-thenar, ulnar unit (u)-hypothenar and unit (c)-central plus distal palm. Individual parameters need similar consideration to choose adequate treatment. Unit (r) and unit (u) are regions of secondary touch demanding protective sensation. Restoration of sensation using neurovascular, fasciocutaneous flaps is recommended. In unit (c), tactile gnosis is of less, mechanical resistance of greater value. Reconstruction of soft tissue resistance is suggested first in this unit. In laborers, free fascial- or muscle flaps with plantar instep skin grafts may achieve near to anatomical reconstruction with minimal sensation. Combined defects involving unit (c) require correlation with individual parameters for optimal flap selection. Defect coverage of the palm should not consist of merely providing sensate vascularized tissue. The most appropriate procedure should be derived from careful defect analysis to achieve near to anatomical reconstruction.

He was diagnosed with pyriform sinus poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma T3N0M0 (Stage II) and underwent partial laryngopharyngectomy, lymphadenectomy in the right neck, tracheostomy, and reconstruction of the larynx and aryepiglottic fold with a free radial forearm flap and the associated vascularized palmaris longus tendon. No particular problems occurred after surgery, and swallowing and articulation functions were successfully recovered. A free jejunum transfer is the first choice for reconstruction of a defect after partial hypopharyngectomy, but reconstruction of the supracricoid complex structure of the larynx using a free jejunum transfer after partial laryngopharyngectomy may lead to aspiration of intestinal fluids. In this case, we performed functional reconstruction of the laryngopharyngeal defect using a free radial forearm flap including a vascularized tendon of the palmaris longus, and satisfactory postoperative function was achieved.

{"title": "Hypoxia-induced insulin-like growth factor II contributes to retinal vascularization in ocular development.", "abstract": "In ocular development, retinal physiological hypoxia in response to the retinal metabolic activity controls retinal vascular development, which is regulated by variable angiogenic factors. Herein, we demonstrated that hypoxia-induced IGF-II could contribute to retinal vascularization in ocular development. In the developing retina, IGF-II expression appears to be predominant on retinal vessels, which was chronologically increased and peaked during active retinal angiogenesis similar to VEGF expression. Under hypoxic condition, IGF-II as well as VEGF was significantly up-regulated in retinal vascular endothelial cells. In addition, IGF-II treatment could also increase VEGF expression in retinal vascular endothelial cells. The VEGF expression induced by IGF-II was mediated by ERK-1/2 activation. Moreover, IGF-II strongly promoted angiogenic processes of migration and tube formation of retinal microvascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, our results provided that hypoxia-induced IGF-II may regulate retinal vascular development not only directly by IGF-II-mediated angiogenic activity, but also indirectly by IGF-II-induced VEGF expression. Therefore, the potential contribution of IGF-II to pathological retinal angiogenesis should be furthermore explored for the development of novel treatments to vaso-proliferative retinopathies.", "journal": "Biochimie", "date": "2011-11-29", "authors": ["Jin HyoungKim", "Sung WookPark", "Young SukYu", "Kyu-WonKim", "Jeong HunKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biochi.2011.11.003"}

According to the Simple Endoscopic Score, Crohn disease was divided into inactive and active disease by colonoscopy. To assess the vascularization of the involved bowel loop in a region expected to be seen at colonoscopy, the contrast agent uptake was measured by using quantitative analysis.

In many cases cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is the only option for fertility preservation. Although autologous transplantation of cryopreserved-thawed ovarian tissue has resulted in live births, slow graft revascularization and ischemia after transplantation leads to substantial follicular loss. Therefore, methods to improve and hasten graft vascularization are needed. The aim of the study was to examine the benefits of host and graft treatments with melatonin, hyaluronan (HA), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and vitamin E with regard to the outcome of human ovarian tissue grafting.\nFive young cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic ovarian surgery for fertility preservation donated ovarian tissue. Thawed ovarian samples were transplanted into immunodeficient mice divided into seven groups: (A) no treatment; (B) host treatment with melatonin before and after grafting; (C) graft incubation with HA-rich biological glue before transplantation; (D) host as in (B), graft as in (C); (E) host as in (B), graft incubation with VEGF-A and vitamin E; (F) graft as in (C) combined with VEGF-A and vitamin E; (G) host as in (B), graft as in (F). Graft survival was assessed by follicle counts, apoptosis assay and immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and VEGF-A expression.\nOnly grafts implanted in melatonin-treated hosts and grafts incubated with HA-rich biological glue retained their original size. Apoptosis was significantly lower after host treatment with melatonin and graft incubation with HA-rich biological glue plus VEGF-A and vitamin E than in untreated grafts; apoptosis was specifically low in Group G. There were significantly more atretic follicles in the untreated group than in most treated groups.\nThe findings suggest that host treatment with melatonin or graft incubation with HA-rich biological glue, especially when combined with VEGF-A and vitamin E improves graft survival.

Rats with chemically induced mammary tumors were divided into two nutritional groups: a control group and a group fed with an n-3 PUFA-enriched diet. Both groups were treated with docetaxel. Functional vascular parameters (ultrasounds, interstitial fluid pressure) were determined for both nutritional groups before (W(0)) and during docetaxel treatment [every 2 h up to 1 week (W(+1)) for interstitial fluid pressure, at W(+1) for Evans blue extravasation and at W(+2) and W(+6) for ultrasounds]. In vitro n-3 PUFA-induced changes in endothelial cell migration, permeability and phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase were evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Whereas docetaxel stabilized tumor growth in the rat control group, it induced a 50% tumor regression in the n-3 PUFA group. Ultrasounds parameters were consistently lower in the n-3 PUFA group at all time points measured, down to \u223c50% at W(+6). A single dose of docetaxel in the n-3 PUFA group markedly reduced interstitial fluid pressure from 2 h after injection up to W(+1) when Evans blue extravasation was increased by 3-fold. A decreased activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in tumors of the n-3 PUFA group, and in human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultured with n-3 PUFA, points toward a PUFA-induced disruption of nitric oxide signaling pathway. This normalization of tumor vasculature functions under n-3 PUFA diet indicates that such a supplementation, by improving drug delivery in mammary tumors, could be a complementary clinical strategy to decrease anticancer drug resistance.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2011-11-25", "authors": ["SophieKornfeld", "CarolineGoupille", "SophieVibet", "StephanChevalier", "AmandinePinet", "JustineLebeau", "Fran\u00e7oisTranquart", "PhilippeBougnoux", "EricMartel", "AnneMaurin", "SergeRichard", "PascalChamperoux", "KarineMah\u00e9o"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgr274"}

In this study, we introduce a significant modification to a previously described rat model of combined superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) myocutaneous/vascularized femur transplantation. We previously noted autocannibalization in orthotopic myocutaneous SIEA allotransplants, which complicated clinical and histologic evaluation of rejection. We therefore designed syngeneic experiments in eight Lewis (RTl(1) ) rat pairs to explore the feasibility of tunneling the SIEA component of chimeric SIEA myocutaneous/vascularized femur flaps to the recipient dorsum. Vascularized SIEA myocutaneous/femur transplants survived in their entirety to POD 63 study endpoint with patent anastomoses in seven of eight (87.5%) transplants as confirmed clinically, histologically, and via near-infrared fluorescent angiography.

The critical step in bone formation is to replace the avascular cartilage template with vascularized bone. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are associated with each other, sharing some essential regulators. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in both angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of VEGF expression is not well known in osteoblasts. In this study, quantitative real-time RT-PCR results revealed that VEGF expression was down-regulated in Osx-null calvarial cells and that osteoblast marker osteocalcin expression was absent. Overexpression of Osx in stable C2C12 mesenchymal cells using a Tet-off system resulted in up-regulation of both osteocalcin and VEGF expression. The inhibition of Osx by siRNA led to repression of VEGF expression in osteoblasts. These results suggest that Osx controls VEGF expression. Transfection assays demonstrated that Osx activated VEGF promoter activity. A series of VEGF promoter deletion mutants were examined and the minimal Osx-responsive region was defined to the proximal 140-bp region of the VEGF promoter. Additional point mutants were used to identify two GC-rich regions that were responsible for VEGF promoter activation by Osx. Gel shift assay showed that Osx bound to the VEGF promoter sequence directly. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that endogenous Osx associated with the native VEGF promoter in primary osteoblasts. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed decreased VEGF protein levels in the tibiae of Osx conditional knock-out mice.

{"title": "Fibroblast growth factor-1-induced ERK1/2 signaling reciprocally regulates proliferation and smooth muscle cell differentiation of ligament-derived endothelial progenitor cell-like cells.", "abstract": "The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a fibrous connective tissue located between the tooth root and the alveolar bone. We previously demonstrated that a single cell-derived culture of primarily cultured PDL fibroblasts has the potential to construct an endothelial cell (EC) marker-positive blood vessel-like structure, suggesting that the fibroblastic lineage cells in ligament tissue could act as the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which regenerate to construct a vascular system around the damaged ligament tissue. Moreover, we showed that EPC-like fibroblasts expressed not only EC markers but also smooth muscle cell (SMC) markers. Generally, an interaction between ECs and SMCs regulates blood vessel development and remodeling, and is required for the formation of a mature and functional vascular network. However, the mechanism underlying the SMC differentiation of the ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts remains to be clarified. In this study, we showed that suppression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1)-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling with the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 completely abolished the FGF-1-induced proliferation of the ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts. In addition, U0126 treatment of FGF-1-stimulated ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts significantly induced the SMC differentiation of the cells. Thus, FGF-1-induced ERK1/2 signaling not only promoted the proliferation of the ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts, but also suppressed the SMC differentiation of the cells, suggesting that FGF-1 controls the construction of a vascular network around the ligament tissue by regulating the proliferation and SMC differentiation of the EPC-like cells through ERK-mediated signaling.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2011-11-24", "authors": ["MikakoTakahashi", "NaotoOkubo", "NaoyukiChosa", "NorikoTakahashi", "MihoIbi", "MasaharuKamo", "HarumiMizuki", "AkiraIshisaki", "SeikoKyakumoto"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2011.847"}

We describe two patients who experienced high-energy traumatic injuries to their limbs that resulted in significant destruction of their first and second metatarsal bones with overlying soft-tissue trauma not amenable to local coverage. In both cases, a vascularized free fibular osteocutaneous flap was used to reconstruct the metatarsal bone defect and traumatized soft tissues so that a proximal amputation was avoided. At an average of 14 months of follow-up, both patients had recovered well and regained independent ambulation, with one patient being able to play soccer. We show that the free fibular osteoseptocutaneous flap is useful in reconstructing significant metatarsal bone defects and in avoiding amputations in this patient population.

{"title": "Angiogenic properties of the chemokine RANTES/CCL5.", "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease that is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. This disease is defined by the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque, which is responsible for artery obstruction and affects the heart by causing myocardial infarction. The vascular wall is composed of three cell types and includes a monolayer of endothelial cells and is irrigated by a vasa vasorum. The formation of the vascular network from the vasa vasorum is a process involved in the destabilization of this plaque. Cellular and molecular approaches are studied by in vitro assay of activated endothelial cells and in in vivo models of neovascularization. Chemokines are a large family of small secreted proteins that have been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of angiogenesis during several pathophysiological processes such as ischaemia. Chemokines may exert their regulatory activity on angiogenesis directly by activating the vasa vasorum, or as a consequence of leucocyte infiltration through the endothelium, and/or by the induction of growth factor expression such as that of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). The present review focuses on the angiogenic activity of the chemokines RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted)/CCL5 (CC chemokine ligand 5). RANTES/CCL5 is released by many cell types such as platelets or smooth muscle cells. This chemokine interacts with GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) and GAG (glycosaminoglycan) chains bound to HSPGs (heparan sulfate proteoglycans). Many studies have demonstrated, using RANTES/CCL5 mutated on their GAG or GPCR-binding sites, the involvement of these chemokines in angiogenic process. In the present review, we discuss two controversial roles of RANTES/CCL5 in the angiogenic process.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2011-11-23", "authors": ["NadineSuffee", "BenjaminRichard", "HannaHlawaty", "OlivierOudar", "NathalieCharnaux", "AngelaSutton"], "doi": "10.1042/BST20110651"}

Endothelial cell (EC) differentiation and vasculature formation are dependent on spatio-temporal cues in the extracellular matrix that dynamically interact with cells, a process difficult to reproduce in artificial systems. Here we present a novel bifunctional peptide that mimics matrix-bound vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and can be used to encode spatially controlled angiogenic signals in collagen scaffolds. The peptide is comprised of a collagen mimetic domain that was previously reported to bind to type I collagen by a unique hybridization mechanism, and a VEGF mimetic domain with pro-angiogenic activity. Circular dichroism and collagen binding studies confirm the triple helical structure and the collagen binding affinity of the collagen mimetic domain, and EC culture studies demonstrate the peptide's ability to induce endothelial cell morphogenesis and network formation as a matrix-bound factor in 2D and 3D collagen scaffolds. We also show spatial modification of collagen substrates with this peptide that allows localized EC activation and network formation.

In an in vivo incisional hernia repair model in rats, the antibiotic-coated mesh results in appropriate tissue integration with adequate vascularization and collagen formation.

To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) alterations of microvasculature following SCI, we utilized an established rat SCI model. Based on the hypothesis that the spinal cord would undergo reorganization and postinjury modification of the vascular networks after SCI, we reconstructed the normal and injured angioarchitecture using micro-CT images of silicone rubber microsphere-perfused specimens. Several morphometric parameters were used to study the 3D vascular alterations in the SCI rat model, including the casting-based vessel volume fraction, connectivity density, separation, thickness and thickness distribution. Our results indicated that the microvascular spatial conformations were significantly different between the normal and injured spinal cord segments. The morphometric changes showed an increase of the vessel volume fraction and separation and a decrease of vessel connectivity density during the vascular healing process after SCI. Our results may contribute to elucidation of the mechanisms of compensatory vascular reconstitution in traumatized spinal cord. The method used here has the potential to improve our understanding of changes in the spatial architecture of vascular networks after SCI compared to the conventional histomorphology techniques. In summary, we developed a new methodology to analyze neurovascular pathology based on 3D vascular network patterns and features in an experimental rat SCI model.

Gastric ulcers were induced by thermal cauterization under ether anesthesia, and healing was observed for 14 days after ulceration. The numbers of macrophages and microvessels in the gastric mucosa were determined immunohistochemically with anti-CD68 and anti-CD31 antibodies, respectively. Expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA was determined via real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the mucosal content of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) was determined via enzyme immunoassay on day 10 after ulceration. The healing of gastric ulcers was significantly delayed in op/op mice compared with +/? mice. Further, significantly fewer macrophages were observed in the normal gastric mucosa of op/op mice than in +/? mice. Ulcer induction caused a marked accumulation of macrophages around the ulcer base in +/? mice, but this response was attenuated in op/op mice. The mucosal PGE(2) content as well as the expression of COX-2, VEGF, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA were all upregulated in the ulcerated area of +/? mice but significantly suppressed in op/op mice. The degree of vascularization in the ulcerated area was significantly lower in op/op mice than in +/? mice.

Furthermore, significant differences in length density at day 0 and day 3 were found between recently STZ-induced moderately diabetic and nondiabetic animals in response to FTY720 local release (P < .05, Student t test).\nDriving the islet revascularization process using local release of factors, such as FTY720, from biodegradable polymers makes an attractive system for the improvement of islet transplant success. Preliminary study results suggest that a recently induced moderately diabetic state may potentiate the mechanism by which local release of FTY720 from polymer fibers increases length density of microvessels.

{"title": "New alginate microcapsule system for angiogenic protein delivery and immunoisolation of islets for transplantation in the rat omentum pouch.", "abstract": "Severe hypoxia caused by a lack of vascular supply and an inability to retrieve encapsulated islets transplanted in the peritoneal cavity for biopsy and subsequent evaluation are obstacles to clinical application of encapsulation strategies for islet transplantation. We recently proposed an omentum pouch model as an alternative site of encapsulated islet transplantation and have also described a multi-layer microcapsule system suitable for coencapsulation of islets with angiogenic protein in which the latter could be encapsulated in an external layer to induce vascularization of the encapsulated islet graft. The purpose of the present study was to determine the angiogenic efficacy of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) released from the external layer of the new capsule system in the omentum pouch graft. We prepared 2 groups of alginate microspheres, each measuring \u223c600 \u03bcm in diameter with a semipermeable poly-L-ornithine (PLO) membrane separating 2 alginate layers. While one group of microcapsules contained no protein (control), FGF-1 (1.794 \u03bcg/100 microcapsules) was encapsulated in the external layer of the other (test) group. From each of the 2 groups, 100 microcapsules were transplanted separately in an omentum pouch created in each normal Lewis rat and were retrieved after 14 days for analysis of vessel density using the technique of serial sample sections stained for CD31 with quantitative three-dimensional imaging. We found that FGF-1 released from the external layer of the test microcapsules induced a mean \u00b1 SD vessel density (mm(2)) of 198.8 \u00b1 59.2 compared with a density of 128.9 \u00b1 10.9 in pouches measured in control capsule implants (P = .03; n = 5 animals/group).

{"title": "Cellular immunoisolation for islet transplantation by a novel dual porosity electrospun membrane.", "abstract": "Immunoisolation strategies have the potential to impact the treatment of several diseases, such as hemophilia, Parkinson's and endocrine disorders, such as parathryroid disorders and diabetes. The hallmark of these disease states is the amelioration of the disease process by replacement of the deficient protein. Naturally, several cellular therapeutic strategies like genetically modified host cells, stem cells, donor cells, or even complex tissues like pancreatic islets have been investigated. Current evidence suggests that successful strategies must incorporate considerations for local hypoxia, vascularity, and immunoisolation. Additional regulatory concerns also include safe localization of implanted therapeutic cells to allow for monitoring, dose adjustment, or removal when indicated. Local hypoxia and cellular toxicity can be detrimental to the survival of freshly implanted pancreatic islets, leading to a need for a larger initial number of islets or repeated implantation procedures. The lack of adequate donors and the large number of islet equivalents needed to achieve euglycemic states amplify the nature of this problem. We have developed a novel immunoisolation device based on electrospun nylon, primarily for islet transplantation, such that the inner component functions as a cellular barrier while allowing diffusion, whereas the outer component can be optimized for tissue integration and accelerated vascularization. Devices explanted after subcutaneous implantation in wild-type B6 mice after a period of 30 days show vascular elements in the outer layer of the electrospun device. The inner layer when intact functioned as an effective barrier to cellular infiltration. The preimplantation of such a device, with a relatively thin inner barrier membrane, will allow for adequate vascularization and reduce postimplantation hypoxia. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an electrospun isolation device that can be easily assembled, modified by varying the electrospinning parameters, and functionalized with surface-active molecules to accelerate vascularization.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2011-11-22", "authors": ["LKrishnan", "L RClayton", "E DBoland", "R MReed", "J BHoying", "S KWilliams"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.10.031"}

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether R2/Fc (a VEGF neutralizing antibody) and SU5416 (a VEGF receptor II [Flk-1] inhibitor) could ameliorate particle-induced inflammatory osteolysis in a mouse model.\nUltrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) particles were introduced into established air pouches in BALB/c mice, followed by implantation of calvaria bone from syngeneic littermates. Drug treatment was started 2 weeks after bone implantation, and mice without drug treatment were included as controls. Pouch tissues were harvested 4 weeks after bone implantation for molecular and histological analysis, and implanted bone degradation was analyzed by microcomputed tomography.\nExposure to UHMWPE particles induced inflammatory osteolysis, which was associated with increased expression of VEGF/Flt-1 proteins. Treatment with R2/Fc significantly improved UHMWPE particle-induced inflammatory osteolysis, and reduced the expression of VEGF/Flt-1 proteins. However, SU5416 treatment showed no effect on UHMWPE particle-induced inflammatory osteolysis.\nOur findings indicate that VEGF signaling exerts a regulatory effect on the development of UHMWPE-induced inflammatory osteolysis, through its unique Flt-1, rather than Flk-1, receptor located on monocyte/macrophage cell lineages.

{"title": "Low intracellular ATP levels exacerbate carcinogen-induced inflammatory stress response and inhibit in vitro tubulogenesis in human brain endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Solid tumor development requires angiogenesis and is correlated to the expression of inflammatory markers through cellular metabolic and energetic adaptation. While high glycolysis rates enable the cancer cell compartment to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), very little is known about the impact of low intracellular ATP concentrations within the vascular endothelial cell compartment, which is responsible for tumor angiogenesis. Here, we investigated the effect of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glucose analog that inhibits glycolysis through intracellular ATP depletion, on human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) angiogenic properties. While preformed capillaries remained unaffected, we found that in vitro tubulogenesis was dose-dependently decreased by 2-DG and that this correlated with reduced intracellular ATP levels. Procarcinogenic signaling was induced with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and found to trigger the proinflammatory marker cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker GRP78 expression, whose inductions were potentiated when PMA was combined with 2-DG treatment. Inversely, PMA-induced matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene expression and protein secretion were abrogated in the presence of 2-DG, and this can be partially explained by reduced nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling. Collectively, we provide evidence for an intracellular ATP requirement in order for tubulogenesis to occur, and we link increases in ER stress to inflammation.

Biopsies of muscle and skin of vascularized composite allografts from mixed chimeras showed few infiltrating cells compared with extensive infiltrates in biopsies of vascularized composite allografts from marrow donors. Elevated levels of CD3+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells were found in skin and muscle of vascularized composite allografts of mixed chimeras compared with normal tissues. In mixed chimeras, increased numbers of T-regulatory cells were found in draining compared with nondraining lymph nodes of vascularized composite allografts.\nThese data suggest that nonmyeloablative HCT may form the basis for future clinical applications of solid organ transplantation and that T-regulatory cells may function toward maintenance of the vascularized composite allograft.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2011-11-16", "authors": ["David WMathes", "BillannaHwang", "Scott SGraves", "JamesEdwards", "JeffChang", "Barry EStorer", "TiffanyButts-Miwongtum", "George ESale", "Richard ANash", "RainerStorb"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0b013e318237d6d4"}

For example, overexpression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at controlled levels is an attractive strategy to overcome the crucial bottleneck of graft vascularization and to avoid aberrant vascular growth. Since the regenerative potential of MSCs is rapidly lost during in vitro expansion, we sought to develop an optimized technique to achieve high-efficiency retroviral vector transduction of MSCs derived from both adipose tissue (adipose stromal cells, ASCs) or bone marrow (BMSCs) and rapidly select cells expressing desired levels of VEGF with minimal in vitro expansion. The proliferative peak of freshly isolated human ASCs and BMSCs was reached 4 and 6 days after plating, respectively. By performing retroviral vector transduction at this time point, >90% efficiency was routinely achieved before the first passage. MSCs were transduced with vectors expressing rat VEGF(164) quantitatively linked to a syngenic cell surface marker (truncated rat CD8). Retroviral transduction and VEGF expression did not affect MSC phenotype nor impair their in vitro proliferation and differentiation potential. Transgene expression was also maintained during in vitro differentiation. Furthermore, three subpopulations of transduced BMSCs homogeneously producing specific low, medium, and high VEGF doses could be prospectively isolated by flow cytometry based on the intensity of their CD8 expression already at the first passage. In conclusion, this optimized platform allowed the generation of populations of genetically modified MSCs, expressing specific levels of a therapeutic transgene, already at the first passage, thereby minimizing in vitro expansion and loss of regenerative potential.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The slowly adhering cell (SAC) population also survived better than the RAC population in kinetic in vitro assays that simulate conditions of oxidative and inflammatory stress. When evaluated for the treatment of a myocardial infarction (MI), intramyocardial injection of the SACs more effectively improved echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular (LV) remodeling and contractility than the transplantation of the RACs. Immunohistological analysis revealed that hearts injected with SACs displayed a reduction in myocardial fibrosis and an increase in infarct vascularization, donor cell proliferation, and endogenous cardiomyocyte survival and proliferation in comparison with the RAC-treated hearts.

Current screening and diagnostic imaging modalities, like x-ray mammography and ultrasonography, focus on morphological changes of breast tissue. However, these techniques still miss some cancers and often falsely detect cancer. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting the disease can probably be improved by focusing on the consequences of tumor angiogenesis: the increased microvessel density with altered vascular characteristics. In this review, various techniques for imaging breast tumor vasculature are discussed. Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is the most-used imaging modality in this field. It has a proven high sensitivity, but a low specificity and cannot be applied in all women. Moreover, it has problems with detecting ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On the contrary, contrast enhanced digital mammography can detect DCIS, but requires the use of ionizing radiation. Contrast enhanced ultrasound provides real-time information about true intravascular blood volume and flow. However, this technique still has difficulties with discriminating benign from malignant tissue. Moreover, these three imaging modalities all require the injection of contrast agents. Two relatively new techniques that do not use external contrast agents are diffuse optical imaging and photoacoustic imaging.

In vitro studies on HUVEC showed that GNX-686 inhibited cell growth with an ED(50) of 20-25 \u03bcM, while human HeLa tumor cells and non-transformed embryonic mouse fibroblasts were less sensitive for the drug. More importantly, at 4 \u03bcM, a concentration that was non-toxic to any cell in culture, GNX-686 showed a significant inhibitory effect on tube formation by HUVEC, indicating a profound anti-angiogenic activity. Angiogenesis inhibition was subsequenly tested in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo. A significant angiostatic activity was observed in the CAM model, and results were compared with the effect of bevacizumab, a well known and clinically used VEGF inhibitor. Under our experimental conditions, GNX-686 was found to be as effective as bevacizumab, significantly changing the morphology of the vascular network, as illustrated and quantified by the relative number of branching points and the relative mean mesh size of the vascular network. In another in vivo model of neovascularization, the mouse retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the vascular network of GNX-686-treated mice was significantly altered, reducing the density of the retinal microvasculature, as compared to the control retinas. Immunohistochemical processing of the GNX-686 treated (4\u03bcM) eyes showed over 50% reduction of the number of cell nuclei associated with neovasculature, as compared to the control-treated eye.

{"title": "IL-12 triggers a programmatic change in dysfunctional myeloid-derived cells within mouse tumors.", "abstract": "Solid tumors are complex masses with a local microenvironment, or stroma, that supports tumor growth and progression. Among the diverse tumor-supporting stromal cells is a heterogeneous population of myeloid-derived cells. These cells are alternatively activated and contribute to the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor; overcoming their immunosuppressive effects may improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. We recently found that engineering tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells to secrete the inflammatory cytokine IL-12 improved their therapeutic efficacy in the B16 mouse model of established melanoma. Here, we report the mechanism underlying this finding. Surprisingly, direct binding of IL-12 to receptors on lymphocytes or NK cells was not required. Instead, IL-12 sensitized bone marrow-derived tumor stromal cells, including CD11b(+)F4/80(hi) macrophages, CD11b(+)MHCII(hi)CD11c(hi) dendritic cells, and CD11b(+)Gr-1(hi) myeloid-derived suppressor cells, causing them to enhance the effects of adoptively transferred CD8(+) T cells. This reprogramming of myeloid-derived cells occurred partly through IFN-\u03b3. Surprisingly, direct presentation of antigen to the transferred CD8(+) T cells by tumor was not necessary; however, MHCI expression on host cells was essential for IL-12-mediated antitumor enhancements. These results are consistent with a model in which IL-12 enhances the ability of CD8(+) T cells to collapse large vascularized tumors by triggering programmatic changes in otherwise suppressive antigen-presenting cells within tumors and support the use of IL-12 as part of immunotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2011-11-08", "authors": ["Sid PKerkar", "Romina SGoldszmid", "PawelMuranski", "DhanalakshmiChinnasamy", "ZhiyaYu", "Robert NReger", "Anthony JLeonardi", "Richard AMorgan", "EnaWang", "Francesco MMarincola", "GiorgioTrinchieri", "Steven ARosenberg", "Nicholas PRestifo"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI58814\n10.1038/nature01322\n10.4049/jimmunol.0802740\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1016/j.coi.2010.01.009\n10.1126/science.7513904\n10.1038/nm1096-1096\n10.1002/eji.200939892\n10.1200/JCO.2004.10.041\n10.1172/JCI45862\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5324\n10.1172/JCI33522\n10.1084/jem.20062056\n10.1517/14712598.2.5.513\n10.1084/jem.20061104\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00442.x\n10.1016/j.intimp.2011.01.030\n10.1517/14712598.7.11.1705\n10.1016/S1359-6101(01)00032-6\n10.1084/jem.178.4.1223\n10.1038/ni.1947\n10.1126/science.1065543\n10.1172/JCI118843\n10.1200/JCO.2005.00.463\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0735\n10.1038/mt.2010.313\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3037\n10.1182/blood-2007-07-099226\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.06.017\n10.1073/pnas.1015855107\n10.1016/j.coi.2010.01.021\n10.1189/jlb.0705358\n10.1006/smim.1997.0091\n10.1084/jem.20050732\n10.1200/JCO.2003.12.119\n10.1056/NEJM199008303230904\n10.1007/BF01741329\n10.1126/science.270.5235.475\n10.1016/1074-7613(94)90087-6\n10.1126/science.1129003\n10.1038/nri2635\n10.1016/j.coi.2010.01.020\n10.1097/PPO.0b013e3181c51f37\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2000.00157.x\n10.1084/jem.20030590\n10.1097/CJI.0b013e3182187600"}
{"title": "ThyroScreen system: high resolution ultrasound thyroid image characterization into benign and malignant classes using novel combination of texture and discrete wavelet transform.", "abstract": "Using right equipment and well trained personnel, ultrasound of the neck can detect a large number of non-palpable thyroid nodules. However, this technique often suffers from subjective interpretations and poor accuracy in the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign thyroid lesions. Therefore, we developed an automated identification system based on knowledge representation techniques for characterizing the intra-nodular vascularization of thyroid lesions. Twenty nodules (10 benign and 10 malignant), taken from 3-D high resolution ultrasound (HRUS) images were used for this work. Malignancy was confirmed using fine needle aspiration biopsy and subsequent histological studies. A combination of discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and texture algorithms were used to extract relevant features from the thyroid images. These features were fed to different configurations of AdaBoost classifier. The performance of these configurations was compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our results show that the combination of texture features and DWT features presented an accuracy value higher than that reported in the literature. Among the different classifier setups, the perceptron based AdaBoost yielded very good result and the area under the ROC curve was 1 and classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 100%. Finally, we have composed an Integrated Index called thyroid malignancy index (TMI) made up of these DWT and texture features, to facilitate distinguishing and diagnosing benign or malignant nodules using just one index or number. This index would help the clinicians in more quantitative assessment of the thyroid nodules.", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "date": "2011-11-08", "authors": ["U RajendraAcharya", "OliverFaust", "S VinithaSree", "FilippoMolinari", "Jasjit SSuri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2011.10.001"}
{"title": "The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 are activated during implantation and placentation in sheep.", "abstract": "The progression of implantation and placentation in ruminants is complex and is regulated by interplay between sex steroids and local signaling molecules, many of which have immune function. Chemokines and their receptors are pivotal factors in implantation and vascularization of the placenta. Based on known critical roles for chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) during early pregnancy in other species, we hypothesized that CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 would increase in the endometrium and conceptus in response to implantation in ewes. The objectives of the current study were to determine if CXCL12 and CXCR4 were upregulated in: endometrium from pregnant compared to non-pregnant ewes and in, conceptuses, cotyledons, caruncles and intercaruncular tissue.\nTissues were collected from sheep on Days 12, 13, 14, and 15 of either the estrous cycle or pregnancy and from pregnant ewes on Days 35 and 50. Blood samples from jugular and uterine vein were also collected on all days. Conceptuses were collected from mature ewes on Days 13, 15, 16, 17, 21 and 30 of gestation. Real time PCR was used to determine relative mRNA concentrations for CXCL12 and CXCR4 and Western blot analysis was employed to confirm protein concentration.\nDifferences described are P < 0.05. In the endometrium, CXCR4 mRNA and protein was greater on Day 15 of pregnancy compared to the estrous cycle. CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA in conceptuses was greater on Days 21 and 30 compared to earlier days. CXCL12 mRNA was greater in cotyledons on Day 35 compared to Day 50. On Day 35 of gestation, CXCR4 was greater compared to Day 50 in caruncle and intercaruncular tissue. White blood cells obtained from jugular and uterine vein collection had the greatest mRNA concentration of CXCL12 on Day 35 of pregnancy.\nA comprehensive analysis of CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression in fetal and maternal tissues during early pregnancy is reported with noteworthy differences occurring during implantation and placentation in sheep.

However, this beta-blocking drug could be responsible for an eventually increased risk of ischemic stroke due to the underlying cerebral vascular disease. To more accurately understand the effects of propranolol on brain vascularization, we examined PS patients treated with this drug for airway or visual complications using brain perfusion SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography). In the past, this examination has been shown to be useful in the management of patients with different neurovascular disorders.\nClinical records and imaging studies were reviewed in 7 patients with a diagnosis of PS. All patients underwent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), echocardiography, chest X-ray and ophthalmologic, neurological, and cardiologic assessments. They received 2-3 mg/kg/day propranolol in an attempt to treat stridor or avoid ophthalmologic occlusion. We performed SPECT after 3-6 months of treatment.\nSPECT showed a normal uptake in the frontal and temporal regions despite vascular abnormalities found with MRA imaging. Significant improvements of symptoms and in the volume of the hemangioma were noted in all cases without signs of a reduction of brain blood perfusion.\nPropranolol treatment was safe in our patients who did not show signs of perfusion changes. The high sensitivity for detecting functional impairment makes brain perfusion SPECT useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PS considered at risk of neurovascular impairment. Accurate knowledge of its pathophysiological basis, together with the appropriate technique and careful interpretation of reporting, will enhance the clinical use of brain SPECT in those patients.", "journal": "European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

However, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the quantitative role of marrow-derived EPCs in cancer vascularization is extremely variable. We have found that human and murine white adipose tissue (WAT) is a very rich reservoir of CD45-CD34(+) EPCs with endothelial differentiation potential, containing a mean of 263 times more CD45-CD34(+) cells/mL than bone marrow. Compared with marrow-derived CD34(+) cells mobilized in blood by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, purified WAT-CD34(+) cells expressed similar levels of stemness-related genes, significantly increased levels of angiogenesis-related genes, and increased levels of FAP-\u03b1, a crucial suppressor of antitumor immunity. In vitro, WAT-CD34(+) cells generated mature endothelial cells and capillary tubes as efficiently as mature mesenchymal cells. The coinjection of human WAT-CD34(+) cells from lipotransfer procedures contributed to tumor vascularization and significantly increased tumor growth and metastases in several orthotopic models of human breast cancer in immunodeficient mice. Endothelial cells derived from human WAT-CD34(+) cells lined the lumen of cancer vessels. These data indicate that CD34(+) WAT cells can promote cancer progression and metastases.

Clinical studies on the effect of additional systemic application of bevacizumab (BE), a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor, to SCT showed a slight increase of patient survival. Herein, we studied in a rat model of colorectal liver metastasis whether a locoregional application of oxaliplatin (OX) and BE via hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) is more effective to inhibit metastatic growth compared to systemic drug application. Ten days after implantation of CC531 colorectal cancer cells into the left liver lobe of WAG/Rij rats, animals underwent either HAI or systemic intravenous application of BE (5\u00a0mg/kg body weight), OX (85\u00a0mg/m(2) body surface) or a combination of both. Sham-treated animals received saline and served as controls. Tumor volume was measured at days 10 and 13 using three dimensional ultrasound. At day 13 tumor tissue was analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically. Systemic application of OX, BE or their combination did not affect tumor volume when compared to controls. In contrast, HAI of BE and particularly the combination of BE and OX significantly reduced tumor volume. In the tumor tissue this was associated with a decrease of vascularization and cell proliferation as well as an increase of cell apoptosis, as indicated by a decreased number of PECAM-1- and PCNA-positive cells and an increased number of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells. Locoregional administration of BE, particularly in combination with OX, enhances the inhibitory effect on hepatic metastatic growth compared to systemic application of the drugs.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2011-11-05", "authors": ["JensSperling", "ThiloSch\u00e4fer", "ChristianZiemann", "AnnaBenz-Weiber", "OttoKollmar", "Martin KSchilling", "Michael DMenger"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-011-9432-6"}

The spectrum of ophthalmological findings in ROP exists from minimal sequelae, which do not affect vision, to bilateral retinal detachment and total blindness. With the increased survival of very small infants, retinopathy of prematurity has become one of the leading causes of childhood blindness. Over the past two decades, major advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of ROP, to a large extent as a result of changes in clinical risk factors (oxygen and non-oxygen related) and characteristics observed in ROP cases. This article provides a literature review on the evolution in clinical characteristics, classification and treatment modalities and indications of ROP. Special attention is hereby paid to the neonatal factors influencing the development of ROP and to the necessity for everyone caring for premature babies to have a well-defined screening and treatment protocol for ROP. Such screening protocol needs to be based on a unit-specific ROP risk profile and, consequently, may vary between different European regions.\nRetinopathy of prematurity is an important cause of ocular morbidity and blindness in children.

Mechanisms that govern the development of the kidney vasculature are poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the anatomical development, embryological origin, lineage relationships, and key regulators of the kidney arterioles and postglomerular circulation.

More recently, Masquelet described the use of a cement spacer placed within the osseous void followed by staged bone grafting within the induced biomembrane formed around the spacer as a potential treatment strategy to manage these large defects.This article describes a series of 11 patients for which we used this technique of staged bone grafting following placement of an antibiotic spacer to successfully manage osseous long bone defects ranging from 4 to 15 cm. The limbs were stabilized and aligned at the time of initial spacer placement with a plate and screw construct, intramedullary nail, or fine wire fixator. Osteoinductive substances including bone morphogenic protein-2 and platelet rich concentrate were used in addition to allograft to improve bony healing. In our series, osseous consolidation and full weight bearing was achieved in 10 of 11 patients. Two patients developed heterotopic ossification.

{"title": "Preparation of chitosan films using different neutralizing solutions to improve endothelial cell compatibility.", "abstract": "The development of chitosan-based constructs for application in large-size defects or highly vascularized tissues is still a challenging issue. The poor endothelial cell compatibility of chitosan hinders the colonization of vascular endothelial cells in the chitosan-based constructs, and retards the establishment of a functional microvascular network following implantation. The aim of the present study is to prepare chitosan films with different neutralization methods to improve their endothelial cell compatibility. Chitosan salt films were neutralized with either sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution, NaOH ethanol solution, or ethanol solution without NaOH. The physicochemical properties and endothelial cell compatibility of the chitosan films were investigated. Results indicated that neutralization with different solutions affected the surface chemistry, swelling ratio, crystalline conformation, nanotopography, and mechanical properties of the chitosan films. The NaOH ethanol solution-neutralized chitosan film (Chi-NaOH/EtOH film) displayed a nanofiber-dominant surface, while the NaOH aqueous solution-neutralized film (Chi-NaOH/H(2)O film) and the ethanol solution-neutralized film (Chi-EtOH film) displayed nanoparticle-dominant surfaces. Moreover, the Chi-NaOH/EtOH films exhibited a higher stiffness as compared to the Chi-NaOH/H(2)O and Chi-EtOH films. Endothelial cell compatibility of the chitosan films was evaluated with a human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. Compared with the Chi-NaOH/H(2)O and Chi-EtOH films, HMECs cultured on the Chi-NaOH/EtOH films fully spread and exhibited significantly higher levels of adhesion and proliferation, with retention of the endothelial phenotype and function. Our findings suggest that the surface nanotopography and mechanical properties contribute to determining the endothelial cell compatibility of chitosan films.

{"title": "Application of microtechnologies for the vascularization of engineered tissues.", "abstract": "Recent advances in medicine and healthcare allow people to live longer, increasing the need for the number of organ transplants. However, the number of organ donors has not been able to meet the demand, resulting in an organ shortage. The field of tissue engineering has emerged to produce organs to overcome this limitation. While tissue engineering of connective tissues such as skin and blood vessels have currently reached clinical studies, more complex organs are still far away from commercial availability due to pending challenges with in vitro engineering of 3D tissues. One of the major limitations of engineering large tissue structures is cell death resulting from the inability of nutrients to diffuse across large distances inside a scaffold. This task, carried out by the vasculature inside the body, has largely been described as one of the foremost important challenges in engineering 3D tissues since it remains one of the key steps for both in vitro production of tissue engineered construct and the in vivo integration of a transplanted tissue.

However, those nonunions that are secondary to primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of bone and often related to irradiation still remain a challenging problem. The condition could be more perplexing when bone healing abilities are greatly compromised and reliable stabilization is difficult.\nWe performed an operation using free vascularized fibular graft in combination with a locking plate on a 47-year-old female patient who had suffered from a three-year femoral nonunion after courses of radiochemotherapy for the treatment of primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of bone, a spontaneous femoral shaft fracture, an intramedullary nailing, and some nonoperative interventions in sequence. Primary union of the graft was obtained at 9 months without wound infection. No recurrence of lymphoma occurred in the 61-month follow-up, nor did a stress fracture or failure of fixation.

A portable blood oxygenator or a lung assist device for ambulatory or long-term use would greatly benefit patients with chronic lung disease. In this work, a biomimetic blood oxygenator system was developed which consisted of a microfluidic vascular network covered by a gas permeable silicone membrane. This system was used to determine the influence of key microfluidic parameters-channel size, oxygen exposure length, and blood shear rate-on blood oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. Total gas transfer increased linearly with flow rate, independent of channel size and oxygen exposure length. On average, CO(2) transfer was 4.3 times higher than oxygen transfer. Blood oxygen saturation was also found to depend on the flow rate per channel but in an inverse manner; oxygenation decreased and approached an asymptote as the flow rate per channel increased. These relationships can be used to optimize future biomimetic vascular networks for specific lung applications: gas transfer for carbon dioxide removal in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or oxygenation for premature infants requiring complete lung replacement therapy.", "journal": "ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)", "date": "2011-11-01", "authors": ["Erik KBassett", "David MHoganson", "Justin HLo", "Elliot J NPenson", "Joseph PVacanti"], "doi": "10.1097/MAT.0b013e318234a3ac"}

Circulating numbers of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells (BMDECs), which facilitate angiogenesis and contribute to repair of vascular endothelium, increase during pregnancy. Thus, we hypothesized that relaxin enhances BMDEC NO production, circulating numbers, and function. Recombinant human relaxin-2 (rhRLX) stimulated PI3K/Akt B-dependent NO production in human BMDECs within minutes, and activated BMDEC migration that was inhibited by L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester. In BMDECs isolated from relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 2 gene (Rxfp2) knockout and wild-type mice, but not Rxfp1 knockout mice, rhRLX rapidly increased NO production. Similarly, rhRLX increased circulating BMDEC number in Rxfp2 knockout and wild-type mice, but not Rxfp1 knockout mice as assessed by colony formation and flow cytometry. Taken together, these results indicate that relaxin effects BMDEC function through the RXFP1 receptor. Finally, both vascularization and incorporation of GFP-labeled BMDECs were stimulated in rhRLX-impregnated Matrigel pellets implanted in mice.

The chorioallantoic placenta contains an elliptical-shaped region, the placentome, characterized by hypertrophied uterine and embryonic epithelial cells supported by dense vascular networks. The remainder of the chorioallantoic placenta, the paraplacentome, is also highly vascularized but uterine and chorionic epithelia are thin. An omphaloplacenta with hypertrophied epithelia is located in the abembryonic hemisphere of the egg. There is extensive placental transport of organic and inorganic nutrients, e.g., 85-90% of neonatal calcium is received via placental transfer. Calcium uptake by extraembryonic membranes of squamates correlates with expression of the intracellular calcium binding protein, calbindin-D(28K) , and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) is a marker for active calcium transport. We estimated expression of calbindin-D(28K) and PMCA in the chorioallantoic membrane in a developmental series of embryos using immunoblotting and used immunohistochemistry to define the cellular localization of calbindin-D(28K) to test the hypotheses that 1) expression of calcium transporting proteins is coincident with placental transport of calcium and 2) the placenta is functionally specialized for calcium transport in regions of structural differentiation. Calbindin-D(28K) and PMCA were detected at low levels in early stages of development and increased significantly prior to birth, when embryonic calcium uptake peaks. These data support the hypothesis that placental calcium secretion occurs over an extended interval of gestation, with increasing activity as embryonic demand escalates in late development. In addition, calbindin-D(28K) expression is localized in chorionic epithelial cells of the placentome and in the epithelium of the omphalopleure of the omphaloplacenta, which supports the hypothesis that regional structural differentiation in the placenta reflects functional specializations for calcium transport.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["Haley KStinnett", "James RStewart", "Tom WEcay", "Rebecca APyles", "Jacquie FHerbert", "Michael BThompson"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.11030"}

To better summarize the findings of the studies, the fat grafting procedure was arbitrarily divided into 4 essential parts to determine the best donor sites and how the fat grafts should be harvested, processed, and placed.\nWhile most studies show no difference in the viability of fat grafts harvested from different donor sites, one study shows that more adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are found within the fat grafts harvested from the lower abdomen or inner thigh. Fat grafts harvested with syringe aspiration and processed with centrifugation at 1200 g for 3 min clearly have better viability. In addition, viable adipocytes and ADSCs as well as growth factors can be concentrated within the fat grafts after proper centrifugation. The studies also reinforce the principle that fat grafts, once placed, should have a maximal amount of contact with the vascularized tissue in the recipient site for better survival.\nMost scientific studies in fat grafting research support a more rationalized technique that should be selected by surgeons for fat grafting. The technique includes proper selection of donor sites, proper harvest and process of fat grafts, and proper placement of fat grafts.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["Lee L QPu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2011.09.033"}

{"title": "Necessity for re-vascularization after spinal cord injury and the search for potential therapeutic options.", "abstract": "Disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and microvascular changes leading to reduction of blood supply represent hallmarks of spinal cord secondary injury causing further deterioration of the traumatized patient. Injury to the blood vessels starts with prominent hemorrhage and generation of inflammation. Furthermore, spinal cord ischemia and extravasation of blood components contribute to edema formation resulting in death of neural cells. Endogenous attempts of re-vascularization have been observed although these newly formed vessels display morphological and functional abnormalities. The unfavorable regulation of angiogenic and counterregulatory anti-angiogenic factors during the complicated course of vessel remodeling after SCI is suspected to participate in the failure of re-vascularization and vessel stabilization. Repression of the expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), placental growth factor (PlGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) contributes to vessel regression. Therefore, therapeutic applications of angiogenic factors following SCI are promising strategies to restore blood flow in the lesion.", "journal": "Current neurovascular research", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["UrsulaGraumann", "Marie-Fran\u00e7oiseRitz", "OliverHausmann"], "doi": "10.2174/156720211798121007"}
{"title": "Comparison of different fabrication techniques for human adipose tissue engineering in severe combined immunodeficient mice.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue engineering has been advocated for soft-tissue augmentation and for the treatment of soft tissue defects. The efficacy in terms of persistence of the engineered fat is, however, not yet understood and could depend on the nature of fabrication and application. The high metabolic demand of adipose tissue also points to the problem of vascularization. Endothelial cell (EC) cotransplantation could be a solution. Human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells were seeded on collagen microcarriers and submitted to adipogenic differentiation (\"microparticles\"). In a first run of experiments, these microparticles were implanted under the skin of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (n\u2003=\u200345) with and without the addition of human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). A group of carriers without any cells served as control. In a second run, adipose tissue constructs were fabricated by embedding microparticles in fibrin matrix with and without the addition of HUVEC, and were also implanted in SCID mice (n\u2003=\u200330). The mice were sacrificed after 12 days, 4 weeks, and 4 months. Mature adipose tissue, fibrous tissue, and acellular regions were quantified on whole-specimen histological sections. The implantation of microparticles showed a better sustainment of tissue volume and a higher degree of mature adipose tissue compared with adipose tissue constructs. Immunohistology proved obviously perfused human tissue-engineered vessels. There was a limited but not significant advantage in EC cotransplantation after 4 weeks in terms of tissue volume. In groups with EC cotransplantation, there were significantly fewer acellular/necrotic areas after 4 weeks and 4 months. In conclusion, the size of the implanted tissue equivalents is a crucial parameter, affecting volume maintenance and the gain of mature adipose tissue. EC cotransplantation leads to functional stable vascular networks connecting in part to the host vasculature and contributing to tissue perfusion; however, the long-term benefit depends on additional basic conditions that need further research.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["BernhardFrerich", "KarstenWinter", "KonstanzeScheller", "Ulf-DietrichBraumann"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1525-1594.2011.01346.x"}

{"title": "MULTIMERIN2 impairs tumor angiogenesis and growth by interfering with VEGF-A/VEGFR2 pathway.", "abstract": "MULTIMERIN2 (MMRN2), also known as Endoglyx-1, is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein whose function has so far remained elusive. Given its specific localization in tight association with the endothelium we hypothesized that this protein could modulate neo-angiogenesis. By multiple assays we showed that MMRN2 significantly impaired endothelial cell (EC) migration and organization of a functional vessel network. The interaction of ECs with MMRN2 induced a striking impairment of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation. We focused our attention on VEGFR2, a chief regulator of angiogenesis, and clarified that MMRN2 interfered with the VEGF/VEGFR2 axis through a direct binding with VEGF-A. This novel interaction was assessed in several assays and the affinity was estimated (Kd \u223c50\u2009 nM). We next questioned whether the anti-angiogenic properties of MMRN2 could impair tumor growth. Although overexpression of MMRN2 by HT1080 cells did not affect their growth and apoptotic rate in vitro, it remarkably affected their growth in vivo. In fact, MMRN2-positive cells failed to efficiently grow and form well-vascularized tumors; a similar outcome was observed following treatment of established tumors with a MMRN2 adenoviral construct. Tumor-section immunostaining revealed a strong co-localization of VEGF-A with the ectopically expressed MMRN2. These novel findings suggest that VEGF may be sequestered by MMRN2 and be less available for the engagement to the receptors. Taken together these results highlight MMRN2 as a crucial player in the regulation of EC function, neo-angiogenesis and hence tumor growth. We hypothesize that secreted and deposited MMRN2 may function as a homeostatic barrier halting the sprouting of novel vessels, and suggest that these studies may embody the potential for the development of novel tools for cancer treatment.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-10-25", "authors": ["ELorenzon", "RColladel", "EAndreuzzi", "SMarastoni", "FTodaro", "MSchiappacassi", "GLigresti", "AColombatti", "MMongiat"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.487"}

Despite meticulous surgical care and employment of adjunctive therapies, infection rates remain at 20%, due to the limitations of conventional therapies.\nPersistent bacteria often survive initial debridement and treatment with antibiotics. Thus, the bone graft subsequently implanted to promote healing can be the nidus for infection. The principles of biofilm theory and the \"race to the surface\" have been applied to develop dual-purpose bone grafts that are protected by a sustained release of an antibiotic, thereby preventing bacterial colonization. A simultaneous sustained release of a recombinant human growth factor allows the defect to become vascularized and heal.\nCurrent therapies fail to meet the challenges of open fractures. Tissue engineering and drug delivery approaches can address the challenges of healing large bone defects while protecting the implant from infection. When combined as an adjunctive therapy with existing clinical practices for management of open fractures, dual-purpose bone grafts that release both an antibiotic and a growth factor at biologically relevant time scales can potentially reduce infection rates and improve patient outcomes.", "journal": "Expert opinion on drug delivery", "date": "2011-10-25", "authors": ["Joseph CWenke", "Scott AGuelcher"], "doi": "10.1517/17425247.2011.628655"}

However, the small pore sizes in electrospun scaffolds hinder cell infiltration in vitro and tissue-ingrowth into the scaffold in vivo, limiting their clinical potential. In this study, three separate techniques were evaluated for their capability to increase the pore size of the PCL/col I/nanoHA scaffolds: limited protease digestion, decreasing the fiber packing density during electrospinning, and inclusion of sacrificial fibers of the water-soluble polymer PEO. The PEO sacrificial fiber approach was found to be the most effective in increasing scaffold pore size. Furthermore, the use of sacrificial fibers promoted increased MSC infiltration into the scaffolds, as well as greater infiltration of endogenous cells within bone upon placement of scaffolds within calvarial organ cultures. These collective findings support the use of sacrificial PEO fibers as a means to increase the porosity of complex, bone-mimicking electrospun scaffolds, thereby enhancing tissue regenerative processes that depend upon cell infiltration, such as vascularization and replacement of the scaffold with native bone tissue.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-10-22", "authors": ["Matthew CPhipps", "William CClem", "Jessica MGrunda", "Gregory AClines", "Susan LBellis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.080\n10.3791/1589"}

Among the patients, 19 patients were male and 6 patients were female, ranging in age from 21 years to 57 years, with an average of 41 years. After debridement, the patients got reattachment of skin graft with subdermal vascular network or split-thickness skin graft, and the wound surface was covered with polyvinyl sponge. VSD was removed after 7 to 14 days. The color, survival rate and sensory function of the skin were observed after operation.\nAll the wounds infection was controlled with VSD. The skin survival rate was more than 96% in 16 cases, more than 90% in 7 cases, and skin edge of 2 cases had little necrosis but rehabilitated after dress-changing. The reattached skins had almost normal skin color, soft and abrasion resistant, satisfactory sensory function, and no compression ulcer was observed after 4 weeks.\nVSD combined with graft with subdermal vascular network or split-thickness skin graft helps to promote wound drainage, reattachment of skin, and decrease infection.

{"title": "Transgenic insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulates activation of COX-2 signaling in mammary glands.", "abstract": "Studies show that elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer; however, mechanisms through which IGF-1 promotes mammary tumorigenesis in vivo have not been fully elucidated. To assess the possible involvement of COX-2 signaling in the pro-tumorigenic effects of IGF-1 in mammary glands, we used the unique BK5.IGF-1 mouse model in which transgenic (Tg) mice have significantly increased incidence of spontaneous and DMBA-induced mammary cancer compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Studies revealed that COX-2 expression was significantly increased in Tg mammary glands and tumors, compared to age-matched WTs. Consistent with this, PGE(2) levels were also increased in Tg mammary glands. Analysis of expression of the EP receptors that mediate the effects of PGE(2) showed that among the four G-protein-coupled receptors, EP3 expression was elevated in Tg glands. Up-regulation of the COX-2/PGE(2) /EP3 pathway was accompanied by increased expression of VEGF and a striking enhancement of angiogenesis in IGF-1 Tg mammary glands. Treatment with celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, caused a 45% reduction in mammary PGE(2) levels, attenuated the influx of mast cells and reduced vascularization in Tg glands. These findings indicate that the COX-2/PGE(2) /EP3 signaling pathway is involved in IGF-1-stimulated mammary tumorigenesis and that COX-2-selective inhibitors may be useful in the prevention or treatment of breast cancer associated with elevated IGF-1 levels in humans. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "journal": "Molecular carcinogenesis", "date": "2011-10-19", "authors": ["JieTian", "IsabelLambertz", "Thomas RBerton", "Joyce ERundhaug", "KaoruKiguchi", "Stephanie HShirley", "JohnDigiovanni", "Claudio JConti", "Susan MFischer", "RobinFuchs-Young"], "doi": "10.1002/mc.20868"}

The correction of such fistula is associated with a failure rate of 10 to 40%. The step in successful repair of a fistula is separation of the suture lines in the urethra and skin using well vascularized elastic tissue. We report our experience of using the tunica vaginalis flap as a layer between the neourethra and skin suture line in repair of recurrent urethrocutaneous fistula.\nWe have used the tunica vaginalis flap for the repair of recurrent urethrocutaneous fistula in 14 children with a mean age of 6.5 years (range 3-14 years). All patients had undergone previous hypospadias repair and at least one previous attempt to close the fistula had failed. Surgery was initiated by injecting a povidone solution via urethral meatus to identify all fistulae. The fistulae were closed primarily and urethral suture line was covered with a flap of tunica vaginalis which was harvested either through a small scrotal incision and mobilized via a subcutaneous tunnel into the penile shaft (8/14) or by the same incision as for fistula closure (6/14). The testis was fixed to the scrotum. A urethral catheter was kept for urinary diversion for 10 days.\nThe repair was successful in all but one patient in whom there was leak from the fistula site. One patient in whom tunica vaginalis fascia was tunnelled into neourethra developed scrotal haematoma which needed drainage. Penile cosmesis was acceptable without any significant postoperative testicular complication in 13/14 patients.\nRepair of recurrent urethrocutaneous fistula with a tunica vaginalis flap is highly effective regardless of fistula location. This flap is easy to mobilize and provide effective coverage of urethral suture line.

Some preliminary results are presented and compared with published ultrasonography and phase contrast MRA data. We further simulate a surgical procedure (portacaval shunting) that connects the portal vein with the inferior vena cava (IVC). The simulation confirms that the high pressure gradient between the portal vein and IVC leads to substantially reduced portal perfusion or even reversed flow in the portal veins, thus makes the shunting graft a flow 'highway' in directing portal flow.", "journal": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

{"title": "Lack of angiogenesis in experimental brain metastases.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is believed to be essential for the growth of metastatic tumors in the brain. We analyzed the vascularization of tumors formed by 4 epithelial cell lines (C38, ZR75, HT25, and H1650) and a fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cell line injected into the brains of mice. No peritumoral angiogenesis was observed. Tumors apparently acquired their vasculature by incorporation of native vessels. Vessel density was lower, but vessel diameter and vascular cell proliferation were higher within all tumors versus those in the peritumoral tissue. There was an inverse correlation between the number of incorporated vessels and vascular cell proliferation. Epithelial tumors with pushing growth patterns had lower vessel density and elevated vascular cell proliferation compared with invasive tumors. The incorporated vessels retained their normal structure, with the exception of astrocyte foot processes that were replaced by tumor cells. Attachment to the vascular basement membrane led to the differentiation of the ZR75 breast cancer cells. In the HT1080 metastases, there was intussusceptive angiogenesis, that is, the fibrosarcoma cells that were attached to the vessel caused lumen splitting and filled the developing pillars. Branching angiogenesis was not observed either in the tumors or in control cerebral wounds. These data suggest that sprouting angiogenesis is not needed for the incipient growth of cerebral metastases and that tumor growth in this model is a result of incorporation of host vessels.", "journal": "Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology", "date": "2011-10-18", "authors": ["EdinaBugyik", "KatalinDezso", "LillaReiniger", "Vikt\u00f3riaL\u00e1szl\u00f3", "J\u00f3zsefT\u00f3v\u00e1ri", "J\u00f3zsefT\u00edm\u00e1r", "P\u00e9terNagy", "WalterKlepetko", "Bal\u00e1zsD\u00f6me", "S\u00e1ndorPaku"], "doi": "10.1097/NEN.0b013e318233afd7"}

Clinically, revascularization procedures render completion of root formation in immature teeth. The generation of a pulp-like tissue after seeding of dental pulp stem cells into dentin discs or cylinders and transplantation in\u00a0vivo is possible. In this experimental setup, which mimics the situation in the root canal, the pretreatment of dentin might influence cellular behavior at the cell-dentin interface. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether dentin conditioning can determine cell fate.\nDental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were seeded into a growth factor-laden peptide hydrogel, transferred into dentin cylinders, and transplanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice. Before cell seeding, dentin cylinders were either pretreated with sodium hypochloride (NaOCl) or conditioned with EDTA. The constructs were explanted after 6 weeks and subjected to histological and immunohistochemical analysis.\nIn dentin treated with NaOCl, resorption lacunae were found at the cell-dentin interface created by multinucleated cells with clastic activity. After conditioning with EDTA, DPSCs adjacent to the dentin formed an intimate association with the surface, differentiated into odontoblasts-like cells that expressed dentin sialoprotein, and extended cellular processes into the dentinal tubules. A vascularized soft connective tissue similar to dental pulp was observed inside the dentin cylinder.\nDentin conditioning considerably influences DPSC fate when seeded in close proximity to dentin.

Although the relationship between CPT and type 1 neurofibromatosis is well known, the exact pathogenesis still remains unclear. The fibrous soft tissue found in the pseudarthosis and the abnormal periosteum are certainly a key to the pathology, possibly due to decreased osteogenic capacities and impaired local vascularization.

Numerous treatments based on biological and/or mechanical concepts, surgical or not, have been reported with variable success rates. Vascularized fibular grafts and the Ilizarov technique have greatly transformed the prognosis of CPT.

There was no significant difference of corneal scarring and vascularization between the 2 groups before surgery. Choosing PK or full-bed DLK depended on the patient's own willingness, except those patients with a preoperative endothelial cell count of less than 700 cells/mm(2) or whose endothelial cell count was undetectable were encouraged to undergo only PK. Exclusion criteria were patients with a past history of corneal perforation, nonprimary graft, non-HSK-related corneal scars, and failure to complete a minimum of 12 months of postoperative follow-up. Fifty-eight eyes of 58 patients in the full-bed DLK group and 63 eyes of 63 patients in the PK group met the inclusion criteria. main outcome measures: Postoperative managements, recurrence of HSK, graft rejection, graft survival rate, visual acuity, and corneal endothelial density.\nThe mean postoperative follow-up duration was 45.8 \u00b1 30.9 months in the full-bed DLK group and 47.9 \u00b1 27.2 months in the PK group (P = .70). As compared with the PK group, the full-bed DLK group experienced earlier suture removal (P = .01), needed fewer postoperative visits (P < .001), and had a higher proportion of eyes with full withdrawal of oral acyclovir (P < .001) and topical corticosteroid (P < .001). There were a total of 21 episodes of recurrent HSK in the PK group, more frequent than the 7 episodes in the full-bed DLK group, among which recurrent epithelial keratitis amounted to 13 episodes in the PK group, remarkably more frequent than the 1 episode in the full-bed DLK group. Twenty-six eyes (41.3%) encountered rejection episodes in the PK group, but no rejection episode was found in the full-bed DLK group (P < .001). In 14 eyes in the PK group, graft failure developed because of graft rejection, recurrence of HSK, or both, whereas only in 1 eye in the full-bed DLK group did graft failure develop because of recurrence of HSK (P = .001). The clear graft survival rate in the full-bed DLK group was significantly higher than that in the PK group (P = .01). Corneal endothelial cell density was stable from 1 month through 5 years in the full-bed DLK group, but 51.3% cell loss was found in the PK group at 5 years after surgery. At the last visit, 66.1% of eyes with full-bed DLK grafts and 50.9% of eyes with PK grafts achieved a best-correct visual acuity of 0.5 or better (P = .10).\nAdvantages of full-bed DLK over PK are no allograft rejection, longer graft survival, earlier drug withdrawal of topical steroid and oral acyclovir, less recurrence of HSK, and fewer follow-up visits.

The main advantages of IVM include the real -time analysis of dynamic processes with single-cell resolution. The application of IVM, however, is limited by the availability of animal models that carry visually accessible tumors. These models have evolved over time to become more and more relevant to human tumors. The latest step is the development of a pseudo-orthotopic, syngeneic model for tumor growth and metastasis. In this model, tissue from a variety of mouse organs are grafted in a dorsal skinfold chamber and allowed to revascularize, whereupon tumor cell spheroids are implanted. These spheroids develop into tumors that bear a much closer resemblance to human tumors than xenografts. Unlike xenografts, the vasculature is well-ordered and, because the model is syngeneic, there are no cross-species host immune reactions. The use of fluorescence-tagged pseudo-organs and tumor cells allows IVM analysis and provides real-time access to the development of tumors that closely resemble the real disease.

However, other tissues such as the vasculature exert a critical role before that phase. This study aims to investigate the consequences of overexposure to exogenous glucocorticoids during different time-windows of gestation for the development of the fetal endocrine pancreas.\nPregnant Wistar rats received dexamethasone acetate in their drinking water (1 \u00b5g/ml) during the last week or throughout gestation. Fetuses and their pancreases were analyzed at day 15 and 21 of gestation. Morphometrical analysis was performed on pancreatic sections after immunohistochemistry techniques and insulin secretion was evaluated on fetal islets collected in vitro.\nDexamethasone given the last week or throughout gestation reduced the beta-cell mass in 21-day-old fetuses by respectively 18% or 62%. This was accompanied by a defect in insulin secretion. The alpha-cell mass was reduced similarly. Neither islet vascularization nor beta-cell proliferation was affected when dexamethasone was administered during the last week, which was however the case when given throughout gestation. When given from the beginning of gestation, dexamethasone reduced the number of cells expressing the early marker of endocrine lineage neurogenin-3 when analyzed at 15 days of fetal age.\nGCs reduce the beta- and alpha-cell mass by different mechanisms according to the stage of development during which the treatment was applied. In fetuses exposed to glucocorticoids the last week of gestation only, beta-cell mass is reduced due to impairment of beta-cell commitment, whereas in fetuses exposed throughout gestation, islet vascularization and lower beta-cell proliferation are involved as well, amplifying the reduction of the endocrine mass.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-10-13", "authors": ["OlivierDumortier", "NicolasTheys", "Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8seAhn", "ClaudeRemacle", "BrigitteReusens"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0025576"}

Urethral glanular reconstruction included a deep dorsal incision followed by complete scar excision to create a deep groove presenting well-vascularized recipient bed ensuring appropriate graft healing.\nBetween April 2002 and January 2008, a total of 34 patients (mean age 51.5 years, 14-85 years) were enrolled in the study. Congenital anomalies included hypospadia (n = 19, 53%) and epispadia (n = 2, 6%). Condition of strictures was either iatrogenic (n = 7), due to infection (n = 5), or traumatic (n = 1). Foreskin grafts were used in 13 cases, foreskin and buccal mucosa in one case, penile skin in 6 cases, and inguinal skin/thigh (harvested by electrodermatom) in 14 cases. The combination of meticulous scar excision with a deep incision of the glans was used to provide a well-vascularized grafting bed, thus ensuring excellent graft healing. The outcome analysis included urinary flow, urethral calibration >18 ch, voiding cystometry, and patient's satisfaction in a follow-up regime every 3 months.\nThe average graft length was 4.7 cm (median 8, range 1.5-14). Mean follow-up was 70 months. In 31 patients (91%), no recurrent glanular stenosis was observed resulting in a post-operative flow of average 26.2 ml/s (11-53). Three post-operative wound infections occurred resulting in stricture recurrence, which was treated with internal urethrotomy, buccal mucosa, or penile skin inlay, respectively. Cosmetic results were satisfactory in all patients. Post-operative voiding parameters were significantly improved (P < 0.001).\nThe single-stage dorsal inlay for reconstruction of peno-glandular stenosis represents a reliable method even if the urethral plate is severely scarred or has been excised during previous surgery.

In this study, lung epithelial carcinoma cell functions including adhesion (up to 4 h), proliferation (up to 3 days), apoptosis (up to 5 days), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis (up to 5 days) on poly-lactic-co-glycolic (PLGA) films with various nanotopographies were systematically investigated. Importantly, this study created PLGA films with various nanotopographies (specifically, nano-smooth, 23, 300, and 400 nm hemispherical surface features) but similar surface chemistry in order to focus only on the effect of PLGA topography on cancer cell functions. Simple and effective cast-molding and solvent evaporation methods were used to accomplish this. Atomic force microscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and water contact angle measurements verified similar surface chemistry and energy but varied topographies for all of the PLGA films prepared in this study. Lung epithelial carcinoma cell adhesion, proliferation, and morphology results indicated less cell growth and spreading on nano-smooth and 400 nm surface-featured PLGA compared to any other samples. However, results also demonstrated decreased lung epithelial carcinoma cell VEGF (a key growth factor secreted for the vascularization of tumors) synthesis on the 23 nm surface-featured PLGA compared to the nano-smooth substrates for up to 5 days. In summary, these results provided the first insights into understanding the role that PLGA nanotography may play in mediating lung carcinoma cell functions for a wide range of applications in regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

By dissecting the biological complexity into an amenable number of parameters, systemic manipulation and study in controllable environments closely resembling the in vivo situation is possible. Novel strategies that address the evaluation of either ECM components, growth factors or cell-cell interactions on cellular behaviour are being developed. However, reliable methods that simultaneously recapitulate the natural instructive microenvironments in terms of cell and matrix composition, biological cues, heterogeneity and geometry are not yet available. Such spatially-defined microenvironments may be necessary to initiate and guide the formation of artificial tissues by morphogenetic processes.

Our aim was to evaluate a new method for biliary reconstruction using an isolated pedicled gastric tube in a live animal trial and also to present the first clinical case.\nSeven mongrel dogs underwent biliary reconstruction using gastric tube harvested, completely separated from the greater curvature, and based on a vascularized pedicle with the right gastroepiploic vessels. The tube was interposed between the common bile duct (CBD) and the duodenum. Postoperative mortality, morbidity, liver functions, gross and microscopic histological picture were assessed. The first clinical case was also presented where, in a patient with post-cholecystectomy biliary injury, an isolated pedicled gastric tube was interposed between the proximal and distal ends of the CBD.\nOne dog did not recover from anesthesia and another one died postoperatively from septic peritonitis. Five dogs survived the procedure and showed uneventful course and no cholestasis. The mean anastomotic circumference was 4.8 mm (range 4-6) for CBD anastomosis and 6.2 mm (range 5-7) for duodenal anastomosis. Histologically, anastomotic sites showed good evidence of healing. In the first clinical case, the patient showed clinical and biochemical improvement. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was feasible and assured patent biliary anastomoses.\nIn mongrel dogs, biliary reconstruction using pedicled gastric tube interposition between CBD and duodenum is feasible with satisfactory clinical results, anastomotic circumference and histological evidence of healing.

In this study we aimed to focus on the area postrema, which is so far little studied in humans, in a large sample of subjects aged from 25 gestational weeks to 10 postnatal months, who died of unknown (sudden unexplained perinatal and infant deaths) and known causes (controls). Besides we investigated a possible link between alterations of this structure, sudden unexplained fetal and infant deaths and maternal smoking. By the application of morphological and immunohistochemical methods, we observed a significantly high incidence of alterations of the area postrema in fetal and infant victims of sudden death as compared with age-matched controls. These pathological findings, including hypoplasia, lack of vascularization, cystic formations and reactive gliosis, were related to maternal smoking. We hypothesize that components from maternal cigarette smoke, particularly in pregnancy, could affect neurons of the area postrema connected with specific nervous centers involved in the control of vital functions.

We observed almost total resolution of brain edema in three of five patients after initiation of bevacizumab therapy. In one case with rapid increase of the lesion size despite bevacizumab therapy, SWI showed progressive increase of irregular hypointense structures, most likely corresponding to increasing amounts of pathological microvasculature. In one case with progressive neurological decline, 7-T images showed multiple intratumoral microhemorrhages after the first bevacizumab application.

{"title": "A quantitative theory of solid tumor growth, metabolic rate and vascularization.", "abstract": "The relationships between cellular, structural and dynamical properties of tumors have traditionally been studied separately. Here, we construct a quantitative, predictive theory of solid tumor growth, metabolic rate, vascularization and necrosis that integrates the relationships between these properties. To accomplish this, we develop a comprehensive theory that describes the interface and integration of the tumor vascular network and resource supply with the cardiovascular system of the host. Our theory enables a quantitative understanding of how cells, tissues, and vascular networks act together across multiple scales by building on recent theoretical advances in modeling both healthy vasculature and the detailed processes of angiogenesis and tumor growth. The theory explicitly relates tumor vascularization and growth to metabolic rate, and yields extensive predictions for tumor properties, including growth rates, metabolic rates, degree of necrosis, blood flow rates and vessel sizes. Besides these quantitative predictions, we explain how growth rates depend on capillary density and metabolic rate, and why similar tumors grow slower and occur less frequently in larger animals, shedding light on Peto's paradox.

Recent accumulating evidence suggests that during development the neuronal wiring follows the same routes as the vasculature and that these two systems may share some of the same factors for guidance. Thus, expression of dual angiogenic/neurogenic growth factors was evaluated by in situ hybridization in human primary brain tumors of three different types, i.e., astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas, of increasing grades, in relation with the grade and type of the tumor. For this evaluation we selected vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) and its receptors VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 and the neuropilins 1 and 2 (NRP-1 and NRP-2), which have proangiogenic properties, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-beta (PDGF-R\u03b2), which is required for the functional maturation of blood vessels, the ephrins and their Eph receptors, angiotensinogen (AGT) and thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2), which have potential antiangiogenic properties, and netrin-1 (Net-1), which regulates vascular architecture. We show that the expression of the VEGF-NRP system, PDGF-R\u03b2, TSP-2, AGT, and Net-1 are differentially regulated, either increased or decreased, in relation with the type and grade of the tumor, whereas regulation of the ephrinB system does not seem to be relevant in these human brain tumors.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2011-10-08", "authors": ["MaudClemessy", "Robert CJanzer", "Beno\u00ectLhermitte", "Jean-MarieGasc", "LucienneJuillerat-Jeanneret"], "doi": "10.1007/s11060-011-0715-1"}

{"title": "Bone Marrow Suppression by c-Kit Blockade Enhances Tumor Growth of Colorectal Metastases through the Action of Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1.", "abstract": "Background. Mobilization of c-Kit(+) hematopoietic cells (HCs) contributes to tumor vascularization. Whereas survival and proliferation of HCs are regulated by binding of the stem cell factor to its receptor c-Kit, migration of HCs is directed by stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1. Therefore, targeting migration of HCs provides a promising new strategy of anti-tumor therapy. Methods. BALB/c mice (n = 16) were pretreated with an anti-c-Kit antibody followed by implantation of CT26.WT-GFP colorectal cancer cells into dorsal skinfold chambers. Animals (n = 8) additionally received a neutralizing anti-SDF-1 antibody. Animals (n = 8) treated with a control antibody served as controls. Investigations were performed using intravital fluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Results. Blockade of c-Kit significantly enhanced tumor cell engraftment compared to controls due to stimulation of tumor cell proliferation and invasion without markedly affecting tumor vascularization. C-Kit blockade significantly increased VEGF and CXCR4 expression within the growing tumors. Neutralization of SDF-1 completely antagonized this anti-c-Kit-associated tumor growth by suppression of tumor neovascularization, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and reduction of muscular infiltration. Conclusion. Our study indicates that bone marrow suppression via anti-c-Kit pretreatment enhances tumor cell engraftment of colorectal metastases due to interaction with the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway which is involved in HC-mediated tumor angiogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of oncology", "date": "2011-10-07", "authors": ["KathrinRupertus", "Gudrun C YHaberl", "ClaudiaScheuer", "Michael DMenger", "Martin KSchilling", "OttoKollmar"], "doi": "10.1155/2012/196957"}
{"title": "Calvaria bone chamber--a new model for intravital assessment of osseous angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The faith of tissue engineered bone replacing constructs depends on their early supply with oxygen and nutrients, and thus on a rapid vascularization. Although some models for direct observation of angiogenesis are described, none of them allows the observation of new vessel formation in desmal bone. Therefore, we developed a new chamber model suitable for quantitative in vivo assessment of the vascularization of bone substitutes by intravital fluorescence microscopy. In the parietal calvaria of 32 balb/c mice a critical size defect was set. Porous 3D-poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-blocks were inserted into 16 osseous defects (groups 3 and 4) while other 16 osseous defects remained unequipped (groups 1 and 2). By placing a polyethylene membrane onto the dura mater, the angiogenesis was mainly restricted to the osseous margins (groups 2 and 4). Microvascular density, angiogenesis, and microcirculatory parameters were evaluated repetitively during 22 days. In all animals, only a mild inflammatory reaction was observed with a climax after 2 weeks. The implantation of PLGA scaffolds resulted in a vascular growth directed towards the center of the defect as demonstrated by the significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced central microvascular densitiy from day 3 to day 22 when compared with unequipped chambers. The additional application of polyethylene membrane was found to reduce significantly the microvessel density mainly in the center of both scaffolds and defects. The present calvaria bone chamber allows for the first time to assess quantitatively the angiogenesis arising from desmal bone directly in vivo. Therefore, this chronic model may support the future research in the biological adequacy of bone substitutes.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The formation of abnormal, dysfunctional tumor vasculature and glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are believed to be the major components of the inability to treat these tumors effectively. We analyzed 70 glioblastoma samples by immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence staining. The immunohistochemical expression of the putative brain tumor stem cell markers CD133 and Nestin in paraffin sections was analyzed using morphometry. In all GBM samples, CD133 or Nestin was expressed in tumor and endothelial cells. Double immunofluorescence stainings showed that the two different marked GSCs were found accumulated around the CD31+ blood vessels and CD133/CD31 or Nestin/CD31 co-expression was found in the endothelial cells and GSCs. Furthermore, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the endothelial marker CD31 were co-expressed in GSCs. Therefore, GSCs not only showed distinct perivascular distribution but were capable of differentiating into endothelial cells. We demonstrate that GSCs contribute directly to the tumor vasculature by endothelial cell differentiation.

In 20 consecutive patients suffering from VS and elected for microsurgery via the MCF approach, tumor resection was performed with the aid of the flexible CO(2) laser (\"laser group\", LG).

{"title": "Single-stage reconstruction of skin-involving nasal paraffinoma with pericraniosubgaleal flap.", "abstract": "The removal of a paraffinoma over the nasal bridge may result in thinning and even loss of involved skin as well as a saddle nose deformity. For nasal reconstruction, a variety of techniques using a free graft of autogenous tissue such as fascia, dermofat, or cartilage have been used, either in immediate, single-stage or in delayed, multiphase treatment. However, such reconstructions can be challenging largely due to absorption of the grafted tissue and poor blood supply to the surrounding nasal tissue infiltrated with paraffin. This article reports the successful clinical outcomes of immediate, single-stage reconstructions by wrapping a pericraniosubgaleal flap over the nasal implant after removing a paraffinoma.\nEleven patients with a paraffinoma showing a palpable lump, redness, or telangiectasia over the nasal skin were treated between November 1998 and March 2011. The mean follow-up period was 20.1\u00a0months. As much of the paraffinoma as possible was removed via a bidirectional approach (open rhinoplasty and frontal hairline incision), and the resulting deformity was reconstructed simultaneously using a pericraniosubgaleal flap and turning it over the sculpted nasal implant (ePTFE; GORE-TEX(\u00ae) in nine cases and silicone in two cases).\nNine patients (81.8%) were treated successfully without complications and were satisfied with their results. However, the other two patients complained of incomplete removal of the paraffinoma requiring additional removal. Telangiectasia over the nose improved in four out of six patients after surgery.\nNasal reconstruction using a pericraniosubgaleal flap is one of the most reliable surgical options for treating skin-involving nasal paraffinomas. The advantage of such a method is that a well-vascularized and durable flap, which is resistant to infection, is wrapped over the sculpted nasal implant in a single step. It also reinforces the thinned skin, which makes it easier to form various shapes, producing excellent cosmetic results. Finally, it can also serve as a tolerable graft bed in the case of overlying skin loss.", "journal": "Aesthetic plastic surgery", "date": "2011-10-04", "authors": ["Seung-IlChung", "Young-CheunYou", "Ki-YupKim", "Won-YongYang", "Seok-MinKwon", "Sang-YoonKang"], "doi": "10.1007/s00266-011-9815-8"}

This structure is maintained immediately post-isolation; however, in culture the ECs slowly deteriorate, losing density and branched morphology. We postulate that this deterioration occurs in the absence of blood flow due to limited diffusion of media inside the tissue. To improve exchange of media inside the tissue, we created a microfluidic device to culture islets in a range of flow-rates. Culturing the islets from C57BL6 mice in this device with media flowing between 1 and 7 ml/24 hr resulted in twice the EC-density and -connected length compared to classically cultured islets. Media containing fluorescent dextran reached the center of islets in the device in a flow-rate-dependant manner consistent with improved penetration. We also observed deterioration of EC morphology using serum free media that was rescued by addition of bovine serum albumin, a known anti-apoptotic signal with limited diffusion in tissue. We further examined the effect of flow on beta-cells showing dampened glucose-stimulated Ca(2+)-response from cells at the periphery of the islet where fluid shear-stress is greatest. However, we observed normal two-photon NAD(P)H response and insulin secretion from the remainder of the islet. These data reveal the deterioration of islet EC-morphology is in part due to restricted diffusion of serum albumin within the tissue.

The healing effect of ME and EAF was evaluated by macroscopic and morphometric analyses, immunohistochemical assay (PCNA and SOD) and anti-Helicobacter pylori effect was evaluated by in vitro assay.\nOur results demonstrated that EAF significantly reduced border internal (42%) and external (38%) lesion area (mm(2)) by macroscopic analyses (P<0.05). Animals treated with EAF stimulated some proliferative factors by increasing the height of epithelial regenerative area and the expression of PCNA-positive nuclei. The number of vessels in gastric mucosa of rats treated with EAF reveals an expressive increase (4 times more than vehicle treatment) of vessels that stimulate cells proliferation in the healing region. These results suggest that the recovery of vascularization of the ulcerated area is involved in the healing action of alkaloid fraction of Strychnos pseudoquina. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of 75 \u03bcg/ml from EAF showed an effective in vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of this fraction. EAF also was quite effective in the process of SOD release that is an important protective factor against bacterial agents. The efficacy of EAF was accomplished safely without presenting any alteration of toxicological parameters during 14 day of treatment.\nThe expressive gastric healing effect by increasing cellular proliferation together with expression of SOD activity and antibacterial action against Helicobacter pylori confirm the efficacy of this species in heal gastric mucosa and these results are a important contribution to the knowledge of a crude drug presents at the Brazilian Official Pharmacopoeia since 1929.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2011-10-01", "authors": ["Fl\u00e1viaBonamin", "Thiago MelloMoraes", "H\u00e9lioKushima", "Marcelo AparecidoSilva", "Ariane LeiteRozza", "Cl\u00e1udia HelenaPellizzon", "Tais MariaBauab", "Lucia Regina MachadoRocha", "WagnerVilegas", "Cl\u00e9lia AkikoHiruma-Lima"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2011.08.020"}

Over the past several years, significant effort has been devoted to explore novel delivery strategies, whereas relatively little attention has been paid to understand the impact of physiological constrains such as tumor vasculature on the efficiency of siRNA delivery. Using the previously described positive-readout tumor models where successful siRNA delivery leads to an upregulation of \u03b2-galactosidase within tumor sections, we analyzed the spatial distribution of localized target knockdown within tumor sections relative to tumor hypoxia and found that stable nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP), a lipid nanoparticle-based delivery system, predominantly delivers siRNA to areas adjacent to functional tumor blood vessels. Increasing tumor vascularity by ectopic expression of VEGF resulted in more efficient siRNA delivery to tumors using SNALP. SNALP-mediated delivery of a siRNA-targeting Ran GTPase led to target knockdown and significant antitumor efficacy in the highly vascularized HepG2-derived liver tumors, but not in the poorly vascularized HCT-116-derived liver tumors.

{"title": "Quantitative analysis of venation patterns of Arabidopsis leaves by supervised image analysis.", "abstract": "The study of transgenic Arabidopsis lines with altered vascular patterns has revealed key players in the venation process, but details of the vascularization process are still unclear, partly because most lines have only been assessed qualitatively. Therefore, quantitative analyses are required to identify subtle perturbations in the pattern and to test dynamic modeling hypotheses using biological measurements. We developed an online framework, designated Leaf Image Analysis Interface (LIMANI), in which venation patterns are automatically segmented and measured on dark-field images. Image segmentation may be manually corrected through use of an interactive interface, allowing supervision and rectification steps in the automated image analysis pipeline and ensuring high-fidelity analysis. This online approach is advantageous for the user in terms of installation, software updates, computer load and data storage. The framework was used to study vascular differentiation during leaf development and to analyze the venation pattern in transgenic lines with contrasting cellular and leaf size traits. The results show the evolution of vascular traits during leaf development, suggest a self-organizing mechanism for leaf venation patterning, and reveal a tight balance between the number of end-points and branching points within the leaf vascular network that does not depend on the leaf developmental stage and cellular content, but on the leaf position on the rosette.

In common practice the reconstruction of a bone defect is dependent on the site and size of the lesion: in long bones intercalary defects may be managed with Ilizarov technique of bone transport and distraction osteogenesis or the use of a free or pedicled vascularized bone graft, or with Masquelet technique. For cavitary defects the available surgical options include autograft, allograft or xenograft or the use of synthetic scaffolds to promote bone regeneration. In order to promote a faster bone healing tissue engineering proposed the application of enriched graft to fill bone defects.

{"title": "Fetal HDL/apoE: a novel regulator of gene expression in human placental endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Maternal lipoproteins have been studied extensively in human pregnancies, but little is known about the role of fetal lipoproteins. The vascularized human placenta interfaces between the mother and fetus to transfer nutrients for sustaining pregnancy. Unlike that of adults, fetal high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is in contact with placental vessels, is characterized by a high proportion of apolipoprotein E (apoE). We hypothesize this unique composition of fetal HDL affects key functions of the growing fetal tissues. The aim was to identify genes regulated by apoE-HDL by incubating human placental endothelial cells (HPEC) with either fetal HDL or apoE-rich reconstituted HDL particles (apoE-rHDL). HPEC were exposed to 15 \u03bcg/ml fetal HDL, 15 \u03bcg/ml apoE-rHDL, or medium for 16 h, respectively. Microarray analysis determined genes regulated by fetal HDL and apoE. Characterization of HDL particles revealed a different hydrodynamic radius for apoE-rHDL (13.70 nm) compared with fetal HDL (18.11 nm). Stepwise gene clustering after microarray experiments identified 79 differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) when cells were exposed to HDL compared with controls. Among them 16 genes were downregulated, whereas five genes were upregulated by twofold, respectively. When HPEC were incubated with apoE-rHDL 18-fold more genes (1,417, 12% of transcripts) were regulated (P < 0.05) in contrast to HDL. Thereof, 172 genes were downregulated and 376 genes upregulated (twofold). In the common subset of 38 genes regulated by both HDL particles, genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and cell protection prevailed. Strikingly, results suggest that HDL has the capability of regulating metallothioneins, which may have an effect on oxidative stress in HPEC.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2011-09-29", "authors": ["ManuelaAugsten", "HubertHackl", "BirgitEbner", "AngelaChemelli", "OttoGlatter", "GuntherMarsche", "UweLang", "GernotDesoye", "ChristianWadsack"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00109.2011"}
{"title": "Noninvasive imaging identifies new roles for cyclooxygenase-2 in choline and lipid metabolism of human breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is observed in approximately 40% of breast cancers. A major product of the COX-2-catalyzed reaction, prostaglandin E(2), is an inflammatory mediator that participates in several biological processes, and influences invasion, vascularization and metastasis. Using noninvasive MRI and MRS, we determined the effect of COX-2 downregulation on the metabolism and invasion of intact poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably expressing COX-2 short hairpin RNA. Dynamic tracking of invasion, extracellular matrix degradation and metabolism was performed with an MRI- and MRS-compatible cell perfusion assay under controlled conditions of pH, temperature and oxygenation over the course of 48 \u2009h. COX-2-silenced cells exhibited a significant decrease in invasion relative to parental cells that was consistent with the reduced expression of invasion-associated matrix metalloproteinase genes and an increased level of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. We identified, for the first time, a role for COX-2 in mediating changes in choline phospholipid metabolism, and established that choline kinase expression is partly dependent on COX-2 function. COX-2 silencing resulted in a significant decrease in phosphocholine and total choline that was detected by MRS. In addition, a significant increase in lipids, as well as lipid droplet formation, was observed. COX-2 silencing transformed parental cell metabolite patterns to those characteristic of less aggressive cancer cells. These new functional roles of COX-2 may identify new biomarkers and new targets for use in combination with COX-2 targeting to prevent invasion and metastasis.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2011-09-29", "authors": ["TariqShah", "IoannisStasinopoulos", "FlonneWildes", "SamataKakkad", "DmitriArtemov", "Zaver MBhujwalla"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.1789"}

While focusing on two-dimensional color fundus photography, the authors address the evolution from nondigital to digital imaging and its impact on diagnosis. They also compare several studies performed along the transitional path of this technology. Retinal image processing and analysis, automated disease detection and identification of the stage of diabetic retinopathy (DR) are addressed as well. The authors emphasize the problems of image segmentation, focusing on the major landmark structures of the ocular fundus: the vascular network, optic disk and the fovea. Several proposed approaches for the automatic detection of signs of disease onset and progression, such as microaneurysms, are surveyed. A thorough comparison is conducted among different studies with regard to the number of eyes/subjects, imaging modality, fundus camera used, field of view and image resolution to identify the large variation in characteristics from one study to another.

{"title": "Islets transplanted in immunoisolation devices: a review of the progress and the challenges that remain.", "abstract": "The concept of using an immunoisolation device to facilitate the transplantation of islets without the need for immunosuppression has been around for more than 50 yr. Significant progress has been made in developing suitable materials that satisfy the need for biocompatibility, durability, and permselectivity. However, the search is ongoing for a device that allows sufficient oxygen transfer while maintaining a barrier to immune cells and preventing rejection of the transplanted tissue. Separating the islets from the rich blood supply in the native pancreas takes its toll. The immunoisolated islets commonly suffer from hypoxia and necrosis, which in turn triggers a host immune response. Efforts have been made to improve the supply of nutrients by using proangiogenic factors to augment the development of a vascular supply in the transplant site, by using small islet cell aggregates to reduce the barrier to diffusion of oxygen, or by creating scaffolds that are in close proximity to a vascular network such as the omental blood supply. Even if these efforts are successful, the shortage of donor islet tissue available for transplantation remains a major problem. To this end, a search for a renewable source of insulin-producing cells is ongoing; whether these will come from adult or embryonic stem cells or xenogeneic sources remains to be seen. Herein we will review the above issues and chart the progress made with various immunoisolation devices in small and large animal models and the small number of clinical trials carried out to date.", "journal": "Endocrine reviews", "date": "2011-09-29", "authors": ["Esther SO'Sullivan", "ArturoVegas", "Daniel GAnderson", "Gordon CWeir"], "doi": "10.1210/er.2010-0026"}

This study was to investigate whether puerarin could suppress the invasion and vascularization of E2-stimulated endometriotic tissue.\nThe endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) were successfully established and their invasive ability under different treatments was assessed through a Transwell Assay. Simultaneously, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) were detected by western blotting. Vascularization of endometriotic tissues was observed by chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The staining of MMP-9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), TIMP-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in grafted endometriotic tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry analysis. The purity of ESCs in isolated cells was >95%, as determined by the fluoroimmunoassay of vimentin. E2 (10(-8) mol/L) promoted the invasiveness of ESCs by increasing MMP-9 accumulation and decreasing TIMP-1 accumulation. Interestingly, puerarin (10(-9) mol/L) significantly reversed these effects (P<0.01). The CAM assay indicated that puerarin (10(-9) mol/L) also inhibited the angiopoiesis of endometriotic tissue stimulated by the E2 (10(-8) mol/L) treatment (P<0.05). Accordingly, immunohistochemistry showed that the accumulation of MMP-9, ICAM-1, and VEGF was reduced whereas that of TIMP-1 increased in the combination treatment group compared with the E2 treatment group.\nThis study demonstrated that puerarin could suppress the tissue invasion by ESCs and the vascularization of ectopic endometrial tissues stimulated by E2, suggesting that puerarin may be a potential drug for the treatment of endometriosis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-09-29", "authors": ["DanWang", "YuhuanLiu", "JieHan", "DongxiaZai", "MeiJi", "WenCheng", "LingXu", "LuxiYang", "MiaoxiaHe", "JianNi", "ZailongCai", "ChaoqinYu"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0025011"}

Delta1 expression was upregulated on dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages upon transplantation in a BALB/c into B6 vascularized cardiac transplant model. Whereas administration of anti-Delta1 mAb only slightly delayed survival of cardiac allografts in this fully MHC-mismatched model, it significantly prolonged graft survival in combination with single-dose CTLA4-Ig or in CD28 knockout recipients. The prolongation of allograft survival was associated with Th2 polarization and a decrease in Th1 and granzyme B-producing cytotoxic T cells. The survival benefit of Delta1 blockade was abrogated after IL-4 neutralization and in STAT6KO recipients, but was maintained in STAT4KO recipients, reinforcing the key role of Th2 cell development in its graft-prolonging effects.

Recent advances have meant that endoscopic hemostatic methods are now associated with a reduced rate of re-bleeding, cost, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay and mortality. A prospective study of 50 cases was carried out between August 2001 and July 2003. Patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of upper GI bleeding (UGIB) such as hematemesis, melena, aspirated blood from nasogastric tubes, profuse hematochezia, etc., were included in the study. The patients were selected randomly. The most common cause of UGIB in the present study was acute erosive gastritis (34%) followed by portal hypertension (24%) and peptic ulcer (22%). All 50 patients underwent upper GI endoscopy, of whom 39 patients were treated conservatively and 11 patients underwent endotherapy to control bleeding. Out of 39 patients treated non-endoscopically, 6 cases required laparotomy to control UGIB. 8 of 50 cases had past history of UGIB, 5 of whom had a previous history of endotherapy. One case was treated with de-vascularization as routine hemostatic methods failed. So, initial method of choice to control the bleeding was endotherapy and surgery was undertaken if an endoscopic method failed.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a newly described vascular network structure that was first described in aggressive melanomas. To find out whether VM also exists in astrocytomas and to examine its clinical significance, we studied 80 malignant astrocytoma samples using immunohistochemistry coupled with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. To explore the possible therapeutic methods of anti-VM formation, we cultured astrocytoma cells using three-dimensional Matrigel and investigated the effects of Endostar, an endothelial cell growth inhibitor, on astrocytoma cell growth, invasion, and VM formation. VM structures were found in 8 samples of malignant astrocytomas, seven of which were grade IV astrocytomas. Glioblastoma U251 cells cultured in Matrigel formed vessel-like loops and networks, mimicking the features of VM in vivo, whereas such structures were not found in cultured normal astrocytes or well-differentiated astrocytoma SHG44 cells. In addition, treatment with Endostar led to a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and invasion of both U251and SHG44 cells, but VM formation by U251 cells in vitro was not prominently affected. In conclusion, VM is frequently detected in aggressive glioblastomas, and the presence of VM may constitute a new predictor for poor prognosis in astrocytoma patients.

The complexity of targeting has led to the development of mathematical models to facilitate understanding, but unfortunately, these studies are often only applicable to a particular molecule, making pharmacokinetic comparisons difficult. Here we develop and describe a framework for categorizing primary pharmacokinetics of drugs in tumors. For modeling purposes, we define drugs not by their mechanism of action but rather their rate-limiting step of delivery. Our simulations account for variations in perfusion, vascularization, interstitial transport, and non-linear local binding and metabolism. Based on a comparison of the fundamental rates determining uptake, drugs were classified into four categories depending on whether uptake is limited by blood flow, extravasation, interstitial diffusion, or local binding and metabolism. Simulations comparing small molecule versus macromolecular drugs show a sharp difference in distribution, which has implications for multi-drug therapies. The tissue-level distribution differs widely in tumors for small molecules versus macromolecular biologic drugs, and this should be considered in the design of agents and treatments. An example using antibodies in mouse xenografts illustrates the different in vivo behavior. This type of transport analysis can be used to aid in model development, experimental data analysis, and imaging and therapeutic agent design.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-09-22", "authors": ["Greg MichaelThurber", "RalphWeissleder"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0024696"}

While the precise role of tumor angiogenesis in lymphoma pathogenesis remains under active investigation, emerging data on the proangiogenic properties of the neoplastic lymphoma cells and mechanism of vascular assembly suggest that angiogenesis is highly relevant to the biology and therapy of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Antiangiogenic therapies in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are in various stages of clinical development aiming at distinct angiogenic pathways operative in endothelial cells and perivascular stromal cells. The major classes of available antiangiogenics include anti-VEGF, small molecule inhibitors targeting proangiogenic receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signal transduction pathways, as well as immunomodulatory compounds with antiangiogenic properties. Preliminary clinical data indicate therapeutic advantages associated with strategies targeting dual compartments of vascular cells and tumor cells, as well as multiple angiogenic pathways within the tumor microenvironment.

{"title": "Low-pressure foaming: a novel method for the fabrication of porous scaffolds for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Scaffolds for tissue engineering applications must incorporate porosity for optimal cell seeding, tissue ingrowth, and vascularization, but common fabrication methods for achieving porosity are incompatible with a variety of polymers, limiting widespread use. In this study, porous scaffolds consisting of poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) (POC) containing hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (HA) were fabricated using low-pressure foaming (LPF). LPF is a novel method of fabricating an interconnected, porous scaffold with relative ease. LPF takes advantage of air bubbles that act as pore nucleation sites during a polymer mixing step. Vacuum is applied to expand the nucleation sites into interconnected pores that are stabilized through cross-linking. POC was combined with 20%, 40%, and 60% by weight HA, and the effect of increasing HA particle content on porosity, mechanical properties, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) was evaluated. The effect of the prepolymer viscosity on porosity and the mechanical properties of POC with 40% by weight HA (POC-40HA) were also assessed. POC-40HA scaffolds were also implanted in an osteochondral defect of a rabbit model, and the explants were assessed at 6 weeks using histology. With increasing HA content, the pore size of POC-HA scaffolds can be varied (85 to 1,003 \u03bcm) and controlled to mimic the pore size of native trabecular bone. The compression modulus increased with greater HA content under dry conditions and were retained to a greater extent than with porous scaffolds fabricated using salt-leaching under wet conditions. Furthermore, all POC-HA scaffolds prepared using LPF supported hMSC attachment, and an increase in ALP activity correlated with an increase in HA content. An increase in the prepolymer viscosity resulted in increased compression modulus, greater distance between pores, and less porosity. After 6 weeks in vivo, cell and tissue infiltration was present throughout the scaffold. This study describes a novel method of creating porous osteoconductive POC scaffolds without the need for porogen leaching and provides the groundwork for applying LPF to other elastomers and composites.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

We established a birth cohort in Nigeria to evaluate the early impact of maternal malaria on newborn blood pressure (BP).\nAnthropometric measurements, BP, blood films for malaria parasites and haematocrit were obtained in 436 mother-baby pairs. Women were grouped to distinguish between the timing of malaria parasitaemia as 'No Malaria', 'Malaria during pregnancy only' or 'Malaria at delivery', and parasite density as low (<1000 parasites/\u00b5l of blood) and high (\u2265 1000/\u00b5l).\nPrevalence of maternal malaria parasitaemia was 48%, associated with younger maternal age (p<0.001), being primigravid (p = 0.022), lower haematocrit (p = 0.028). High parasite density through pregnancy had the largest effect on mean birth indices so that weight, length, head and mid-upper arm circumferences were smaller by 300 g, 1.1 cm, 0.7 cm and 0.4 cm respectively compared with 'No malaria' (all p \u2264 0.005). In babies of mothers who had 'malaria at delivery', their SBPs adjusted for other confounders were lower respectively by 4.3 and 5.7 mmHg/kg compared with 'malaria during pregnancy only' or 'none'. In contrast the mean newborn systolic (SBP) and diastolic BPs (DBP) adjusted for birth weight were higher by 1.7 and 1.4 mmHg/kg respectively in babies whose mothers had high compared with low parasitaemia.\nAs expected, prenatal malarial exposure had a significant impact on fetal growth rates.

{"title": "New insights into the biological effects of anthrax toxins: linking cellular to organismal responses.", "abstract": "The anthrax toxins lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET) are essential virulence factors produced by Bacillus anthracis. These toxins act during two distinct phases of anthrax infection. During the first, prodromal phase, which is often asymptomatic, anthrax toxins act on cells of the immune system to help the pathogen establish infection. Then, during the rapidly progressing (or fulminant) stage of the disease bacteria disseminate via a hematological route to various target tissues and organs, which are typically highly vascularized. As bacteria proliferate in the bloodstream, LT and ET begin to accumulate rapidly reaching a critical threshold level that will cause death even when the bacterial proliferation is curtailed by antibiotics. During this final phase of infection the toxins cause an increase in vascular permeability and a decrease in function of target organs including the heart, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, and brain. In this review, we examine the various biological effects of anthrax toxins, focusing on the fulminant stage of the disease and on mechanisms by which the two toxins may collaborate to cause cardiovascular collapse. We discuss normal mechanisms involved in maintaining vascular integrity and based on recent studies indicating that LT and ET cooperatively inhibit membrane trafficking to cell-cell junctions we explore several potential mechanisms by which the toxins may achieve their lethal effects. We also summarize the effects of other potential virulence factors secreted by B. anthracis and consider the role of toxic factors in the evolutionarily recent emergence of this devastating disease.", "journal": "Microbes and infection", "date": "2011-09-21", "authors": ["AnnabelGuichard", "VictorNizet", "EthanBier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micinf.2011.08.016"}

IKs were prepared in baboons by isolating islets from 50% to 70% partial pancreatectomies and injecting them under the autologous renal capsule, allowing vascularization before allogeneic Tx. Baboons with diabetes induced by stereptozotocin or total pancreatectomy, received composite IKs (n = 3) or free islets under the renal capsule or intraportally (n = 3), across fully allogeneic barriers with an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of ATG followed by MMF and tacrolimus. FBS of two of IK recipients decreased immediately after Tx and no insulin therapy was required throughout the experimental period (225 and 301 days). In contrast, all recipients of allogeneic free islets showed unstable FBS levels and required insulin within 2 months. We conclude that in addition to maintaining creatinine in the normal range, fully allogeneic IKs from single primate donors can achieve glucose regulation without insulin therapy, while free islets do not.

It employs the principles from the fields of materials science, cell biology, transplantation, and engineering in an effort to treat or replace damaged tissues. Tissue engineering and development of complex tissues or organs, such as heart, muscle, kidney, liver, and lung, are still a distant milestone in twenty-first century. Generally, there are four main challenges in tissue engineering which need optimization. These include biomaterials, cell sources, vascularization of engineered tissues, and design of drug delivery systems. Biomaterials and cell sources should be specific for the engineering of each tissue or organ. On the other hand, angiogenesis is required not only for the treatment of a variety of ischemic conditions, but it is also a critical component of virtually all tissue-engineering strategies. Therefore, controlling the dose, location, and duration of releasing angiogenic factors via polymeric delivery systems, in order to ultimately better mimic the stem cell niche through scaffolds, will dictate the utility of a variety of biomaterials in tissue regeneration.

It has recently been shown that red blood cells (RBCs) velocity and its changes can be extracted from wide-field optical imaging recordings of intrinsic absorption changes in cortex. Here, we describe a complete processing work-flow for reliable RBC velocity estimation in cortical networks. Several pre-processing steps are implemented: image co-registration, necessary to correct for small movements of the vasculature, semi-automatic image segmentation for fast and reproducible vessel selection, reconstruction of RBC trajectories patterns for each micro-vessel, and spatio-temporal filtering to enhance the desired data characteristics. The main analysis step is composed of two robust algorithms for estimating the RBCs' velocity field. Vessel diameter and its changes are also estimated, as well as local changes in backscattered light intensity. This full processing chain is implemented with a software suite that is freely distributed. The software uses efficient data management for handling the very large data sets obtained with in vivo optical imaging. It offers a complete and user-friendly graphical user interface with visualization tools for displaying and exploring data and results.

{"title": "Semaphorin-plexin signalling genes associated with human breast tumourigenesis.", "abstract": "Gene expression profiling has enabled us to demonstrate the heterogeneity of breast cancers. The potential of a tumour to grow and metastasise is partly dependant on its ability to initiate angiogenesis or growth and remodelling of new blood vessels, usually from a pre-existing vascular network, to ensure delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors to rapidly dividing transformed cells along with access to the systemic circulation. Cell-cell signalling of semaphorin ligands through interaction with their plexin receptors is important for the homeostasis and morphogenesis of many tissues and has been widely studied for a role in neural connectivity, cancer, cell migration and immune responses. This study investigated the role of four semaphorin/plexin signalling genes in human breast cancers in vivo and in vitro.\nmRNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded archival breast invasive ductal carcinoma tissue samples of progressive grades (grades I-III) and compared to tissue from benign tumours. Gene expression profiles were determined by microarray using the Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays and validated by Q-PCR using a Corbett RotorGene 6000. Following validation, the gene expression profile of the identified targets was correlated with those of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231.\nThe array data revealed that 888 genes were found to be significantly (p\u22640.05) differentially expressed between grades I and II tumours and 563 genes between grade III and benign tumours. From these genes, we identified four genes involved in semaphorin-plexin signalling including SEMA4D which has previously been identified as being involved in increased angiogenesis in breast cancers, and three other genes, SEMA4F, PLXNA2 and PLXNA3, which in the literature were associated with tumourigenesis, but not directly in breast tumourigenesis. The microarray analysis revealed that SEMA4D was significantly (P=0.0347) down-regulated in the grade III tumours compared to benign tumours; SEMA4F, was significantly (P=0.0159) down-regulated between grades I and II tumours; PLXNA2 was significantly (P=0.036) down-regulated between grade III and benign tumours and PLXNA3 significantly (P=0.042) up-regulated between grades I and II tumours. Gene expression of SEMA4D was validated using Q-PCR, demonstrating the same expression profile in both data sets. When the sample set was increased to incorporate more cases, SEMA4D continued to follow the same expression profile, including statistical significance for the differences observed and small standard deviations. In vitro the same pattern was present where expression for SEMA4D was significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 cells when compared to MCF-7 cells. The expression of SEMA4F, PLXNA2 and PLXNA3 could not be validated using Q-PCR, however in vitro analysis of these three genes revealed that both SEMA4F and PLXNA3 followed the microarray trend in expression, although they did not reach significance. In contrast, PLXNA2 demonstrated statistical significance and was in concordance with the literature.\nWe, and others, have proposed SEMA4D to be a gene with a potentially protective effect in benign tumours that contributes to tumour growth and metastatic suppression. Previous data supports a role for SEMA4F as a tumour suppressor in the peripheral nervous system but our data seems to indicate that the gene is involved in tumour progression in breast cancer. Our in vitro analysis of PLXNA2 revealed that the gene has higher expression in more aggressive breast cancer cell types. Finally, our in vitro analysis on PLXNA3 also suggest that this gene may have some form of growth suppressive role in breast cancer, in addition to a similar role for the gene previously reported in ovarian cancer. From the data obtained in this study, SEMA4D may have a role in more aggressive and potentially metastatic breast tumours.\nSemaphorins and their receptors, the plexins, have been implicated in numerous aspects of neural development, however their expression in many other epithelial tissues suggests that the semaphorin-plexin signalling system also contributes to blood vessel growth and development. These findings warrant further investigation of the role of semaphorins and plexins and their role in normal and tumour-induced angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro.

Acoustic radiation forces associated with USWF were used to noninvasively organize human endothelial cells into distinct, multicellular planar bands within 3-D collagen gels. The formation and maturation of capillary-like endothelial cell sprouts were monitored over time and compared with sham-exposed collagen constructs, which were characterized by a homogeneous cell distribution. USWF-induced cell banding accelerated the formation and elongation of capillary-like sprouts, promoted collagen fiber alignment and resulted in the maturation of endothelial cell sprouts into lumen-containing, anastomosing networks found throughout the entire volume of the collagen gel. USWF-induced endothelial cell networks contained large, arteriole-sized lumen areas that branched into smaller, capillary-sized structures indicating the development of vascular tree-like networks. In contrast, sprout formation was delayed in sham-exposed collagen gels and endothelial cell networks were absent from sham gel centers and failed to develop into the vascular tree-like structures found in USWF-exposed constructs.

The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound would facilitate the novel assessment of adnexal masses. With the recent advance in 3D power Doppler (3DPD) ultrasound as well as quantitative 3DPD histogram analysis, quantitative and qualitative assessments of the vascularization and blood flow of adnexal masses have become feasible.

It is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays key roles in tumor angiogenesis and has become an important target for antitumor therapy. Pancreatic cancer is a representative of the most highly vascularized and angiogenic solid tumors, which responds poorly to chemotherapy and radiation. Thus, seeking new treatment strategies targeting which have anti-angiogenic capability is urgent in clinical practice. In this study, a co-culture system between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and pancreatic carcinoma cells (PANC-1) was used to investigate the direct effect of melatonin on the tumor angiogenesis and its possible action on VEGF expression. We found HUVECs exhibited an increased cell proliferation and cell migration when co-cultured with PANC-1 cells, but the process was prevented when melatonin added to the incubation medium. Melatonin at concentrations of 1\u2003\u03bcm and 1\u2003mm inhibited the cell proliferation and migration of HUVECs and also decreased both the VEGF protein secreted to the cultured medium and the protein produced by the PANC-1 cells. In addition, the VEGF mRNA expression was also down-regulated by melatonin. Taken together, our present study shows that melatonin at pharmacological concentrations inhibited the elevated cell proliferation and cell migration of HUVECs stimulated by co-culturing them with PANC-1 cells; this was associated with a suppression of VEGF expression in PANC-1 cells.", "journal": "Journal of pineal research", "date": "2011-09-15", "authors": ["PeilinCui", "MinghuaYu", "XingchunPeng", "LvDong", "ZhaoxuYang"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-079X.2011.00933.x"}
{"title": "Impact of drug conjugation on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of anti-STEAP1 antibody-drug conjugates in rats.", "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are designed to combine the exquisite specificity of antibodies to target tumor antigens with the cytotoxic potency of chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition to the general chemical stability of the linker, a thorough understanding of the relationship between ADC composition and biological disposition is necessary to ensure that the therapeutic window is not compromised by altered pharmacokinetics (PK), tissue distribution, and/or potential organ toxicity. The six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 (STEAP1) is being pursued as a tumor antigen target. To assess the role of ADC composition in PK, we evaluated plasma and tissue PK profiles in rats, following a single dose, of a humanized anti-STEAP1 IgG1 antibody, a thio-anti-STEAP1 (ThioMab) variant, and two corresponding thioether-linked monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) drug conjugates modified through interchain disulfide cysteine residues (ADC) and engineered cysteines (TDC), respectively. Plasma PK of total antibody measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed \u223c45% faster clearance for the ADC relative to the parent antibody, but no apparent difference in clearance between the TDC and unconjugated parent ThioMab. Total antibody clearances of the two unconjugated antibodies were similar, suggesting minimal effects on PK from cysteine mutation. An ELISA specific for MMAE-conjugated antibody indicated that the ADC cleared more rapidly than the TDC, but total antibody ELISA showed comparable clearance for the two drug conjugates. Furthermore, consistent with relative drug load, the ADC had a greater magnitude of drug deconjugation than the TDC in terms of free plasma MMAE levels. Antibody conjugation had a noticeable, albeit minor, impact on tissue distribution with a general trend toward increased hepatic uptake and reduced levels in other highly vascularized organs. Liver uptakes of ADC and TDC at 5 days postinjection were 2-fold and 1.3-fold higher, respectively, relative to the unmodified antibodies. Taken together, these results indicate that the degree of overall structural modification in anti-STEAP1-MMAE conjugates has a corresponding level of impact on both PK and tissue distribution.", "journal": "Bioconjugate chemistry", "date": "2011-09-15", "authors": ["C AndrewBoswell", "Eduardo EMundo", "CrystalZhang", "DanielaBumbaca", "Nicole RValle", "Katherine RKozak", "AimeeFourie", "JosefaChuh", "NeelimaKoppada", "OlaSaad", "HermanGill", "Ben-QuanShen", "BonneeRubinfeld", "JayTibbitts", "SurinderKaur", "Frank-PeterTheil", "Paul JFielder", "Leslie AKhawli", "KedanLin"], "doi": "10.1021/bc200212a"}

{"title": "Acceleration of clear cell renal cell carcinoma growth in mice following bevacizumab/Avastin treatment: the role of CXCL cytokines.", "abstract": "The anti-VEGF targeted antibody bevacizumab (BVZ) has been approved for treating renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Although BVZ increases the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic RCC, the effect on overall survival is poor. To gain insight into the limited efficacy of BVZ on overall survival, we analyzed patient samples of RCC for angiogenic factors that may participate in escape from anti-VEGF therapy. Our study shows that the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumors was increased compared with normal tissue. The level of interleukin-8/CXCL8, a pro-angiogenic member of the CXCL family of cytokines, was also increased in tumors. These observations gave us a good reason to analyze the combined effects of BVZ and anti-CXCL8 antibodies on tumor growth. Surprisingly, we report that BVZ accelerates the growth of RCC in nude mice with in vivo selection of tumor cells with an increased growth capacity. Downregulation of receptor tyrosine phosphatase-\u03ba, a phosphatase implicated in EGF receptor regulation, may partly explain this phenomenon. Modification of the vascular network and development of lymphatic vessels through VEGF-C production and compensatory production of pro-angiogenic CXCL cytokines were also observed. The apparent normalization of the vascular network prompted us to associate BVZ with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. While efficient in vitro, paclitaxel did not reverse the anti-VEGF effects in vivo. Anti-CXCL8-targeting antibodies were promising as they decreased intra-tumor VEGF production; decreased the pro-angiogenic CXCL/anti-angiogenic CXCL ratio and did not induce lymphangiogenesis. These observations hold clinical implication as they highlight putative markers implicated in escape from BVZ treatment.

{"title": "Vascular growth in health and disease.", "abstract": "Vascular growth forms the first functional organ system during development, and continues into adult life, wherein it is often associated with disease states. Genetically determined vasculogenesis produces a primary vascular plexus during ontogenesis. Angiogenesis, occurring, e.g., in response to metabolic stress within hypoxic tissues, enhances tissue capillarization. Arteriogenesis denotes the adaptive outgrowth of pre-existent collateral arteries to bypass arterial stenoses in response to hemodynamic changes. It has been debated whether vasculogenesis occurs in the adult, and whether or not circulating progenitor cells structurally contribute to vessel regeneration. Secondly, the major determinants of vascular growth - genetic predisposition, metabolic factors (hypoxia), and hemodynamics - cannot be assigned in a mutually exclusive fashion to vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and arteriogenesis, respectively; rather, mechanisms overlap. Lastly, all three mechanisms of vessel growth seem to contribute to physiological embryogenesis as well as adult adaptive vascularization as occurs in tumors or to circumvent arterial stenosis. Thus, much conceptual and terminological confusion has been created, while therapies targeting neovascularization have yielded promising results in the lab, but failed randomized studies when taken to the bedside. Therefore, this review article aims at providing an exact definition of the mechanisms of vascular growth and their contribution to embryonic development as well as adult adaptive revascularization. We have been looking for potential reasons for why clinical trials have failed, how vitally the application of appropriate methods of measuring and assessment influences study outcomes, and how relevant, e.g., results gained in models of vascular occlusive disease may be for antineoplastic strategies, advocating a reverse bedside-to-bench approach, which may hopefully yield successful approaches to therapeutically targeting vascular growth.", "journal": "Frontiers in molecular neuroscience", "date": "2011-09-10", "authors": ["Anja BondkePersson", "Ivo RBuschmann"], "doi": "10.3389/fnmol.2011.00014\n10.1016/0026-2862(77)90141-8\n10.1038/nm884\n10.1172/JCI17929\n10.1189/jlb.0206087\n10.1016/S0022-1759(02)00420-9\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.01.038\n10.1024/0301-1526/a000092\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02192.x\n10.1080/713773650\n10.1242/dev.045351\n10.1006/dbio.2001.0362\n10.1038/80430\n10.1038/nm0603-653\n10.1038/nm1201-1269\n10.1038/nature03875\n10.1038/nrc2868\n10.1002/dvdy.20407\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02205.x\n10.1161/hh2101.098613\n10.1385/CBB:43:1:001\n10.1096/fj.05-4763fje\n10.1016/j.acthis.2007.02.008\n10.1186/1471-2407-10-641\n10.1095/biolreprod.103.019612\n10.1038/jcbfm.2011.113\n10.1016/S1054-8807(98)00006-4\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64309-X\n10.1080/mic.10.1.45.61\n10.1161/01.RES.0000242560.77512.dd\n10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80221-X\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000132468.82942.F5\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000183609.55154.44\n10.1038/nm0603-669\n10.1007/3-540-36028-X_6\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199711)173:2<206::AID-JCP22>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1056/NEJM197111182852108\n10.1136/hrt.26.1.39\n10.3389/fnmol.2011.00007\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.143990\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90550-V\n10.1002/1521-4141(200102)31:2<480::AID-IMMU480>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1016/j.jvs.2006.02.049\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2007.01861.x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.03.046\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00735.x\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.036\n10.1078/0171-9335-00113\n10.1038/nature05571\n10.1038/jcbfm.2008.69\n10.1007/BF00315706\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.02.094\n10.1038/nature03122\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.013\n10.1038/nm0603-685\n10.1038/ncpgasthep0388\n10.1038/ncb2103\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.161539\n10.1038/nature04923\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.08.025\n10.1093/cvr/cvn055\n10.1038/nature07679\n10.1093/cvr/cvn058\n10.1016/S0021-9290(02)00441-4\n10.1038/nprot.2009.185\n10.1101/gad.266803\n10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00516-7\n10.1242/dev.02883\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00258-X\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65173-5\n10.1242/dev.022830\n10.1098/rspb.1932.0070\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604929\n10.1016/S1050-1738(01)00140-2\n10.1023/A:1006493130855\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.05.002\n10.1016/j.mvr.2010.01.007\n10.1182/blood-2010-07-296731\n10.1182/blood-2002-05-1511\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000138028.14390.e4\n10.1038/nrc1256\n10.1016/j.devcel.2006.04.018\n10.1242/dev.01310\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.177311\n10.1378/chest.128.2.787\n10.1093/cvr/cvq045\n10.1038/leu.2008.381\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1146/annurev.cb.11.110195.000445\n10.1083/jcb.200603176\n10.1007/BF00427580\n10.1007/s00395-008-0760-x\n10.1016/0033-0620(88)90011-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.171827\n10.1073/pnas.0404880101\n10.1023/A:1016094004084\n10.1007/s004280050039\n10.1006/jmcc.2002.2013\n10.3389/fnmol.2011.00004\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.10.045\n10.1161/hc4201.097835\n10.1113/expphysiol.2006.036343\n10.1002/jcb.21523\n10.1038/376062a0\n10.1161/hc2301.092122\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.597799\n10.1177/1358863X09106549\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.526954\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00579.x\n10.1038/nature03952\n10.1093/cvr/cvm102\n10.1161/01.RES.0000052313.23087.3F\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.058\n10.1038/nature05045\n10.1074/jbc.270.37.21453\n10.1074/jbc.273.29.18514\n10.1007/s11010-010-0517-3\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000066321.03474.DA\n10.1038/35025215\n10.1186/bcr573\n10.1016/j.ceb.2010.07.003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000110419.50982.1C"}

The microstructure of the composite scaffolds possessed a well-developed interconnected porosity with approximate optimal pore size ranging from 200 to 500 \u03bcm, ideal for bone regeneration and vascularization. The mechanical properties of the composite scaffolds were evaluated by compressive strength and modulus tests, and the results confirmed their similarity to cortical bone.

Because of its intrinsic poor healing ability, a torn ACL is usually reconstructed by a graft. We developed a multi-phasic, or bone-ligament-bone, tissue-engineered construct for ACL grafts using bone marrow stromal cells and sheep as a model system. After 6 months in vivo, the constructs increased in cross section and exhibited a well-organized microstructure, native bone integration, a functional enthesis, vascularization, innervation, increased collagen content, and structural alignment. The constructs increased in stiffness to 52% of the tangent modulus and 95% of the geometric stiffness of native ACL. The viscoelastic response of the explants was virtually indistinguishable from that of adult ACL. These results suggest that our constructs after implantation can obtain physiologically relevant structural and functional characteristics comparable to those of adult ACL.

{"title": "Human adipose tissue extract induces angiogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro.", "abstract": "The induction of adequate vascularization, a major challenge in tissue engineering, has been tried with numerous methods but with unsatisfactory results. Adipose tissue, an active endocrine organ with dense vasculature, secretes a wide number of angiogenic and adipogenic factors and seems an attractive source for these bioactive factors. We produced a novel cell-free extract from mature human adipose tissue (adipose tissue extract [ATE]) and analyzed the ability of this extract to induce angiogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro and studied the cytokine and growth factor composition of ATE with ELISA and cytokine array. We demonstrate that ATE, when added as cell culture supplement, effectively induced triglyceride accumulation in human adipose stem cells at concentrations from 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL upward in less than a week and caused elevated levels of adipocyte differentiation markers (proliferator-activated receptor gamma and acyl-CoA-binding protein) when treated with at least 350\u2009\u03bcg/mL of ATE. ATE induced angiogenesis from 450\u2009\u03bcg/mL upward after a week in vitro. ATE contained numerous angiogenic and adipogenic factors, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-6, adiponectin, angiogenin, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor-I, as well as lower levels of a wide variety of other cytokines. We here present a novel cell-free angiogenesis- and adipogenesis-inducing agent that is cell-free and easy to produce, and its effect is dose dependent and its composition can be easily modified. Therefore, ATE is a promising novel agent to be used for angiogenesis induction to overcome the challenge of vascularization and for adipogenesis induction in a wide variety of tissue engineering applications in vitro and in vivo. ATE is also efficient for reproduction and modeling of natural adipogenesis in vitro for, for example, obesity and diabetes studies.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Primary vascularization of the graft determines the immunodominance of murine minor H antigens during organ transplantation.", "abstract": "Grafts can be rejected even when matched for MHC because of differences in the minor histocompatibility Ags (mH-Ags). H4- and H60-derived epitopes are known as immunodominant mH-Ags in H2(b)-compatible BALB.B to C57BL/6 transplantation settings. Although multiple explanations have been provided to explain immunodominance of Ags, the role of vascularization of the graft is yet to be determined. In this study, we used heart (vascularized) and skin (nonvascularized) transplantations to determine the role of primary vascularization of the graft. A higher IFN-\u03b3 response toward H60 peptide occurs in heart recipients. In contrast, a higher IFN-\u03b3 response was generated against H4 peptide in skin transplant recipients. Peptide-loaded tetramer staining revealed a distinct antigenic hierarchy between heart and skin transplantation: H60-specific CD8(+) T cells were the most abundant after heart transplantation, whereas H4-specific CD8(+) T cells were more abundant after skin graft. Neither the tissue-specific distribution of mH-Ags nor the draining lymph node-derived dendritic cells correlated with the observed immunodominance. Interestingly, non-primarily vascularized cardiac allografts mimicked skin grafts in the observed immunodominance, and H60 immunodominance was observed in primarily vascularized skin grafts. However, T cell depletion from the BALB.B donor prior to cardiac allograft induces H4 immunodominance in vascularized cardiac allograft. Collectively, our data suggest that immediate transmigration of donor T cells via primary vascularization is responsible for the immunodominance of H60 mH-Ag in organ and tissue transplantation.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2011-09-09", "authors": ["JeanKwun", "SubramaniamMalarkannan", "William JBurlingham", "Stuart JKnechtle"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.1003918"}

Although several surgical treatments have been proposed for aural atresia, revision surgery is often required to address complications associated with the initial procedure, which include external auditory canal stenosis, lateralization of the tympanic membrane and chronic recurrent otorrhea. However, such problems may be addressed by using vascularized skin. We herein report a new method of reconstruction for congenital aural atresia in three cases using the superficial circumflex iliac artery as a pure skin perforator flap.\nThe branch of the superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator was traced distally to a point where it penetrated the dermis. After identifying the branch of the perforator penetrating the dermis (termed the \"pure skin perforator\"), the pure skin perforator flap was elevated. A new external auditory canal was then created by drilling through the mastoid air cells and atresia plate. The pure skin perforator flap was folded into a 1.5\u00d73 cm sac, which was placed into the external auditory canal. The superficial circumflex iliac artery and the superficial circumflex iliac vein were anastomosed to the superficial temporal artery and the superficial temporal vein, respectively.\nAll of the pure skin perforator flaps survived. The flap sizes varied from 10\u00d72.5 to 10\u00d74 cm (average area of 32.5 cm2). These skin perforator flaps were all 2 mm thick.\nPure skin perforator flaps fed only by the dermal subpapillary plexus survived, regardless of the presence of the subdermal plexus.

The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of AMT for various indications of OSD.\nExperience of AMT in 65 patients with different OSD was evaluated. The aim of AMT was to achieve symptomatic relief, reduced inflammation, recurrence, and corneal haze; improve epithelization, stromal healing and visual acuity; and delay keratoplasty. Fresh amniotic membrane was used in all cases by a single surgeon. Follow-up and observations were done to evaluate success of achieving the goal.\nIndications for AMT included primary and recurrent pterygium, various types of corneal ulcers (non-healing ulcer, descemetocele, corneal thinning and perforation), spheroidal degenerations, chemical burn and bullous keratopathy. The aim of AMT was different in different etiological indications. Postoperative follow-up was between 6 and 18 months. Success and complication rate were observed. Symptomatic relief (reduced pain and redness) was seen in patients with various corneal ulcers, chemical burn and bullous keratopathy. Improved epithelialization and stromal healing was noted in corneal ulcer cases. In spheroidal degenerations, keratectomy with AMT improved vision. Recurrence of pterygium was low (4.61%); graft failure in the form of graft rejection was seen in only 3.07% cases of acute keratitis. Corneal vascularization (4.61%) was present but not severe enough to hamper vision.

Wounds and Matrigel plugs were examined histologically and morphometrically for determination of percentage vascular volume (PVV).\nThe PVV in NOS 2-/- incisional wounds and excisional wounds was significantly less than in WT wounds (P = 0\u00b705 and P < 0\u00b7001, respectively). The PVV was significantly less in VEGF-A stimulated Matrigel plugs compared with FGF-2 stimulated plugs in NOS 2-/- mice (P < 0\u00b701), but not in WT mice.\nNOS 2 is significantly involved in angiogenic signalling in healing skin wounds, particularly within the first 7 days. However, Matrigel plug vascularization suggests that the role of NOS 2 in angiogenesis is related to VEGF-A but not FGF-2 stimulated angiogenesis.", "journal": "The British journal of dermatology", "date": "2011-09-08", "authors": ["L CChin", "PKumar", "J APalmer", "J ARophael", "J HDolderer", "G P LThomas", "W AMorrison", "A JPenington", "A GStewart", "G MMitchell"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2133.2011.10599.x"}

We have employed a freely interconnecting porous scaffold developed by us to determine the utility of a covalently bound heparin surface coating for the delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) in vivo. The heparin surface was shown to release VEGF far more rapidly than PDGF-BB in vitro (VEGF: 75\u2009ng/h for 24\u2009h; PDGF-BB: 86\u2009pg/h for >7 days). In rat subcutaneous implants, at 10 days the heparin surface alone increased vessel ingrowth substantially (p<0.05 vs. unmodified scaffold), release of VEGF resulted in a further increase (p<0.05 vs. heparinized scaffold), whereas PDGF-BB had no additional effect. The increase induced by the combination of growth factors was similar to VEGF alone. After 2 months, PDGF-BB, but not VEGF delivery, resulted in a substantial increase in vascularization above that induced by heparin (p<0.05). At the longer time point the combination of growth factors was similar to PDGF-BB. However, only the combination of growth factors significantly elevated the number of ingrowing arterioles (p<0.05 vs. heparinized scaffold). Thus, the covalent modification of a porous scaffold with heparin allows for the differential release of VEGF and PDGF-BB that results in both a rapid and sustained increase in scaffold vascularization.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Restoring the vascular network after burn injury is essential for healing, as it brings oxygen and nutrients to injured tissues, improves the contribution of inflammatory cells and prepares the damaged area for repair and tissue regeneration. To study the process of angiogenesis we used seven groups of five animals, each of adult Wistar rats, which were inflicted with third degree skin burns. From each group of animals, we sampled at successive intervals of three days the entire burnt wound with a ring of surrounding normal skin. Sampled skin fragments were processed for paraffin inclusion, sectioned with a microtome and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin or Masson trichrome. The samples were also analyzed using single chromogenic immunohistochemistry or double immunofluorescence for the presence of CD34 and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Angiogenesis process started at about three days after the burn infliction, with the appearance of tubular structures lined by CD34-positive cells. Subsequently, these cells showed intense proliferative activity that generated a network that included progressive neovascularization around the wound surface. Maximum vascular proliferation occurred at 9-15 days after injury, when the number of capillaries reached 229/mm\u00b2, and the total area of capillary angiogenesis at 100.27 \u03bcm\u00b2 (about 10% of the section area). Subsequently, the process of angiogenesis was gradually reduced, but remained at moderate levels after wound healing.

The material used for this study consisted of 21 pterygion fragments surgically removed in the Ophthalmology Clinic of the Emergency County Hospital, Craiova. Nine patients were men, 22 were women, and they were aged between 58 and 81 years. Ten fragments of epibulbar conjunctiva from the vicinity of the sclero-corneal limbus were used as control tissue. They were initially histological processed by paraffin inclusion. The immunohistochemical processing was made in the Histological, Histopathological and Immunohistochemical Techniques Laboratory of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova. The working technique used was ABC\u00f7HRP (Avidin complexed with biotinylated peroxidase). Angiogenesis in the pterygion was investigated with CD31 marker that allows the identification of the vascular endothelium and the establishment of the vascular microdensity and with VEGF, which allowed the identification of the main source of proangiogenic factors in pterygium. Our study emphasized the existence of a much richer vascularization at the level of the pterygium, compared with the one of the normal conjunctiva. The respective blood vessels were best represented in the subepithelial conjunctive, due to the increased necessities of the proliferating pterygium epithelium. The morphology of the blood vessels is specific for the neoformation vessels, which have a small caliber, are branched and have a rarely visible lumen.

Whether due to trauma or disease, vascular collapse may delay or preclude even experienced medical providers from obtaining standard intravenous (IV) access. Access to the highly vascular intramedullary space of long bones provides a direct link to central circulation. The sternum is a thin bone easily identified by external landmarks that contains well-vascularized marrow. The intraosseous (IO) route rapidly and reliably delivers fluids, blood products, and medications. Resuscitation fluids administered by IV or IO achieve similar transit times to central circulation. The FAST-1 Intraosseous Infusion System is the first FDA-approved mechanical sternal IO device. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the success rate of FAST-1 sternal IO device deployment in the prehospital setting; (2) compare the time of successful sternal IO device placement to published data regarding time to IV access; and (3) describe immediate complications of sternal IO use.\nAll paramedics in the City of Portsmouth, Virginia were trained to correctly deploy the FAST-1 sternal IO device during a mandatory education session with the study investigators. The study subjects were critically ill or injured adult patients in cardiac arrest treated by paramedics during a one-year period. When a patient was identified as meeting study criteria, the paramedic initiated standard protocols; the FAST-1 sternal IO was substituted for the peripheral IV to establish vascular access. Time to deployment was measured and successful placement was defined as insertion of the needle, with subsequent aspiration and fluid flow without infiltration.\nOver the one-year period, paramedics attempted 41 FAST-1 insertions in the pre-hospital setting. Thirty (73%) of these were placed successfully. The mean time to successful placement was 67 seconds for 28 attempts; three of the 31 insertions did not have times recorded by the paramedic. Paramedics listed the problems with FAST-1 insertion, including: (1) difficulty with adhesive after device placement (3 events); (2) failure of needles to retract and operator had to pull the device out of the skin (2 events); and (3) slow flow (1 event). Emergency department physicians noted two events of minor bleeding around the site of device placement.\nThis is the first study to prospectively evaluate the prehospital use of the FAST-1 sternal IO as a first-line device to obtain vascular access in the critically ill or injured patient. The FAST-1 sternal IO device can be a valuable tool in the paramedic arsenal for the treatment of the critically ill or injured patient.

In this study, we investigated the effects of TKI258, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to FGFR, PDGFR, and VEGFR on pancreatic cancer cell lines (HPAF-II, BxPC-3, MiaPaCa2, and L3.6pl), endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Results showed that treatment with TKI258 impaired activation of signaling intermediates in pancreatic cancer cells, endothelial cells, and VSMCs, even upon stimulation with FGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF-A, and PDGF-B. Furthermore, blockade of FGFR/PDGFR/VEGFR reduced survivin expression and improved activity of gemcitabine in MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, motility of cancer cells, endothelial cells, and VSMCs was reduced upon treatment with TKI258. In vivo, therapy with TKI258 led to dose-dependent inhibition of subcutaneous (HPAF-II) and orthotopic (L3.6pl) tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed effects on tumor cell proliferation [bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)] and tumor vascularization (CD31). Moreover, lymph node metastases were significantly reduced in the orthotopic tumor model when treatment was initiated early with TKI258 (30 mg/kg/d). In established tumors, TKI258 (30 mg/kg/d) led to significant growth delay and improved survival in subcutaneous and orthotopic models, respectively.

In order to improve angiogenesis and accelerate osteogenesis, the synergism of co-cultured cells with genetic modification in bone regeneration was investigated in this study. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were transfected with the genes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) by adenovirus, respectively. The co-cultured cells, designated as four groups including BMSC + EPC, Ad-BMP2-BMSC + EPC, BMSC + Ad-VEGF-EPC, and Ad-BMP2-BMSC + Ad-VEGF-EPC groups, were seeded on an alginate gel and then implanted into rat intramuscularly to evaluate the effects on angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Both VEGF and BMP2 could induce the overexpression of inhibitor of DNA-binding 1(Id1) gene which significantly promoted tube formation in vitro and increase the amount of blood vessels in the Ad-BMP2-BMSC + Ad-VEGF-EPC group after implantation. Nevertheless, overexpression of Id1 retarded the terminal differentiation of osteoblasts and the bone formation. Later, osteogenic gene expression at transcriptional level, calcium nodules, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity showed a gradual decrease and the amount of newly formed osteogenesis area exhibited a small increase in the Ad-BMP2-BMSC + Ad-VEGF-EPC group.

While one-day in vitro was sufficient for graft integration, a three-week culturing period, yielding semiorganized vessel structures and muscle fibers, significantly improved grafting efficacy.

Upregulation of key graft angiogenic factors suggest its active role in promoting the angiogenic response. Transition from satellite cells to mature fibers was indicated by increased gene expression, increased capillary to fiber ratio, and similar morphology to normal muscle.

Cochlear response tissues, which express thyroid hormone receptor \u03b2 (encoded by Thrb), include the greater epithelial ridge and sensory epithelium residing inside the bony labyrinth. However, these response tissues lack direct blood flow, implying that mechanisms exist to shuttle hormone from the circulation to target tissues. Therefore, we investigated expression of candidate thyroid hormone transporters L-type amino acid transporter 1 (Lat1), monocarboxylate transporter (Mct)8, Mct10, and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1c1 (Oatp1c1) in mouse cochlear development by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analysis. L-type amino acid transporter 1 localized to cochlear blood vessels and transiently to sensory hair cells. Mct8 localized to the greater epithelial ridge, tympanic border cells underlying the sensory epithelium, spiral ligament fibrocytes, and spiral ganglion neurons, partly overlapping with the Thrb expression pattern. Mct10 was detected in a highly restricted pattern in the outer sulcus epithelium and weakly in tympanic border cells and hair cells. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1c1 localized primarily to fibrocytes in vascularized tissues of the spiral limbus and spiral ligament and to tympanic border cells. Investigation of hypothyroid Tshr(-/-) mice showed that transporter expression was delayed consistent with retardation of cochlear tissue maturation but not with compensatory responses to hypothyroidism.

We will term this condition in the adolescent age, \"juvenile osteonecrosis,\" as we understand that the osteonecrosis pattern responds differently to that in younger patients who develop Perthes and it is similar to adult osteonecrosis. Most of the deformity comes from the collapse and enlargement in size of the femoral head. Therefore, the treatment rationale should be tailored to address these differences. We believe that early core decompression combined with containment in the form of a shelf acetabuloplasty can change the natural history of the disease based on both adolescent and adult literature. The core allows removal of the necrotic segment; it improves vascularization to the affected area and may provide structural support in some cases.

Key problems with synthetic scaffold materials are shrinkage and fast degradation of the scaffolds, a lack of blood supply and nutrition in the central scaffold volume and the absent or the scarce development of bone tissue along the scaffold to bridge the bone defect. The use of composite scaffolds made of biopolymers like polylactidglycolid acid (PLGA) coated and loaded with calcium phosphates (CaP) revealed promising therapeutical options for the regeneration of critical sized bone defects. In this study interconnectively macroporous PLGA scaffolds loaded with microporous and coated with nanoporous calcium phosphates were either seeded in fixed bed bioreactors with allogenic osteogenically induced mesenchymal stem cells and implanted or implanted unseeded into critical sized femoral bone defects. As CSD a 12 mm long segment of the chinchilla femur was excised where the proximal and distal parts of the femur were fixed and stabilized by the use of an eight-hole linear reconstruction plate and secured with three bicortical screws (2.7 mm diameter) on every side of the osteotomy. Aim of the study was if we could find a way to load and coat PLGA scaffolds with CaP so that shrinkage of scaffolds could be avoided, which would favour angiogenesis, blood supply and nutrition in the construct and thus avoid central necroses regularly observed so far in transplants not vascularized and which would be inhabited by cells of he bone lineage forming new bone and healing the defect. Four weeks, at least, a notable shrinkage of the scaffolds was avoided and scaffolds were practically not degraded. Both scaffolds, loaded and loaded and coated, revealed blood vessels in all parts of the implants after 4 weeks. Only in scaffolds seeded with allogenic mesenchymal stem cells the development of bridging bone constructs between proximal and distal edges of the femur was observed after four weeks without further supplementation of growth factors.

Like many tissues, neovascular networks have been shown in vitro to be highly sensitive to mechanical conditions; however, the effects of matrix deformations on neovascular network formation and remodeling in engineered tissue regeneration in vivo have not been evaluated. We quantified the effects of early and delayed functional loading on neovascular growth in a rat model of large bone defect regeneration using compliant fixation plates that were unlocked to allow transfer of ambulatory loads to the defect either at the time of implantation (early), or after 4 wk of stiff fixation (delayed). Neovascular growth and bone regeneration were quantitatively evaluated 3 wk after the onset of loading by contrast-enhanced microcomputed tomography and histology. The initial vascular response to bone injury featured robust angiogenesis and collateral vessel formation, increasing parameters such as vascular volume and connectivity while decreasing degree of anisotropy. Application of early mechanical loading significantly inhibited vascular invasion into the defect by 66% and reduced bone formation by 75% in comparison to stiff plate controls. In contrast, delaying the onset of loading by 4 wk significantly enhanced bone formation by 20% and stimulated vascular remodeling by increasing the number of large vessels and decreasing the number of small vessels. Together, these data demonstrate the mechanosensitivity of neovascular networks and highlight the capacity of biomechanical stimulation to modulate postnatal vascular growth and remodeling.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2011-08-31", "authors": ["Joel DBoerckel", "Brent AUhrig", "Nick JWillett", "NathanielHuebsch", "Robert EGuldberg"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1107019108"}

The aim of this study was to explore whether angiogenesis is increased in relation to certain molecular subtypes of breast cancer with special focus on the basal-like category. Altogether, we analyzed a total of 431 breast cancers from two independent series after dual immunohistochemical staining of Factor VIII for endothelial cells and Ki-67 for proliferating cells. We then determined vascular proliferation in the most vascularized areas of the tumor. In both Series I and II, high vascular proliferation index (VPI) was significantly associated with expression of cytokeratin 5/6 (P = 0.001, 0.010), P-cadherin (P < 0.0005, <0.0005), epidermal growth factor receptor (P = 0.003, 0.001), the basal-like subtype (P = 0.001, 0.011), and the core basal phenotype (P = 0.002, 0.002), respectively.

Recent applications of this donor site as a corticocancellous flap for large intercalary defects bring into question the vascular territory of bone supplied by the descending genicular artery (DGA). This study's purpose is to delineate the proximal extent of periosteal blood supply of the medial column of the femur provided by the DGA system.\nIn 18 cadaveric specimens, the DGA was isolated, measured, and cannulated. Using subtraction techniques of fluoroscopic angiography, the vascular network and proximal-most extent of periosteal perfusion were recorded using radiopaque contrast dye.\nThe DGA branched from the superficial femoral artery 14.2 \u00b1 2.4 cm proximal to the joint line of the knee. The length of the vascular pedicle to its attachment onto the periosteum was 7.7 \u00b1 2.2 cm. All specimens demonstrated a filigree of periosteal vessels dominated by a transverse and a longitudinal branch at the level of the condyle. Proximal perfusion was consistently noted by a large, longitudinal medial metaphyseal periosteal artery. The medial metaphyseal periosteal artery demonstrated that the proximal-most perfusion of the DGA was 13.7 \u00b1 1.3 cm proximal to the joint line. Average femur length was 47.1 \u00b1 3.1 cm. The DGA provided perfusion of 29% \u00b1 2% of the total length of the medial femur.\nThe DGA provides a large and reliable region of periosteal perfusion, suggesting that corticocancellous MFC harvest might provide the benefits of vascularized bone for large, intercalary nonunion defects conventionally treated with fibula flaps.\nHarvest of MFC osseous flaps extending up to 13.7 cm proximal to the joint line can be perfused from the DGA pedicle.

SPECT/CT quantitative analysis was used for the measurement of the volume of distribution of the albumin macroaggregates (MAA; i.e., the vascularized volume) in the liver and the tumor, and the total activity contained in the liver and the tumor in four consecutive patients presenting with a complex liver vascularization referred for a treatment with TheraSphere. SPECT/CT volume measurement proved to be accurate (mean error <7%) and reproducible (interobserver concordance 0.99). For eight treatments, in cases of complex hepatic vascularization, the hepatic volumes based on angiography and CT led to a relative overestimation or underestimation of the vascularized hepatic volume by 43.2 \u00b1 32.7% (5-87%) compared with SPECT/CT analyses. The vascularized liver volume taken into account calculated from SPECT/CT data, instead of angiography and CT data, results in modifying the activity injected for three treatments of eight. Moreover, quantitative analysis of SPECT/CT allows us to calculate the absorbed dose in the tumor and in the healthy liver, leading to doubling of the injected activity for one treatment of eight.

The growth of endometriotic foci is impaired by commercial oncological antiangiogenic drugs used to block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. The dopamine agonist cabergoline (Cb2) inhibits the growth of established endometriosis lesions by exerting antiangiogenic effects through VEGFR2 inactivation. However, the use of ergot-derived Cb2 is associated with an increased incidence of cardiac valve regurgitation. To evaluate the potential usage of non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists for the treatment of human endometriosis, we compared the efficacy of quinagolide with that of Cb2 in preventing angiogenesis and vascularization in a heterologous mouse model of endometriosis. Nude mice whose peritoneum had been implanted with eutopic human endometrial fragments were treated with vehicle, 50\u200a \u03bcg/kg per day oral Cb2, or 50 or 200\u200a \u03bcg/kg per day quinagolide during a 14-day period.

{"title": "Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells enhance chimeric vessel development driven by endothelial cell-coated microtissues.", "abstract": "Adding bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bmMSCs) to endothelialized collagen gel modules resulted in mature vessel formation, presumably caused in part by the observed display of pericyte-like behavior for the transplanted GFP(+) bmMSCs. A previous study determined that rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) delivered on the surface of small (\u223c0.8\u2009mm long\u00d70.5\u2009mm diameter) collagen gel cylinders (microtissues, modular tissue engineering) formed vessels after transplantation into immunosuppressed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Although the RAECs formed vessels in this allogeneic transplant model, there was a robust inflammatory response and the vessels that formed were leaky as shown by microcomputed tomography (microCT) perfusion studies. In vitro assays showed that SD rat bmMSCs embedded into the collagen gel modules increased the extent of EC proliferation and enhanced EC sprouting. In vivo, although vessel number was not affected, the new vessels formed by the bmMSCs and RAECs were more stable and leaked less in the microCT perfusion analysis than vessels formed by implanted RAECs alone. Addition of the bmMSCs also decreased the total number of CD68(+) macrophages that infiltrated the implant and changed the distribution of CD163(+) (M2) macrophages so that they were found within the newly developed vascularized tissue. Most interestingly, the bmMSCs became smooth muscle actin positive and migrated to surround the EC layer of the vessel, which is the location typical of pericytes. The combination of these two effects was presumed to be the cause of improved vascularity when bmMSCs were embedded in the EC-coated modules. Further exploration of these observations is warranted to exploit modular tissue engineering as a means of forming large vascularized functional tissues using microtissue components.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "The role of blood flow and microRNAs in blood vessel development.", "abstract": "The circulatory system is the first organ system that develops during embryogenesis, and is essential for embryo viability and survival. Crucial for developing a functional vasculature are the specification of arterial-venous identity in vessels and the formation of a hierarchical branched vascular network. Sprouting angiogenesis, intussusception, and flow driven remodeling events collectively contribute to establishing the vascular architecture. At the molecular level, arterial-venous identity and branching are regulated by genetically hardwired mechanisms involving Notch, vascular endothelial growth factor and neural guidance molecule signaling pathways, modulated by hemodynamic factors. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that act as silencers to fine-tune the gene expression profile. MicroRNAs are known to influence cell fate decisions, and microRNA expression can be controlled by blood flow, thus placing microRNAs potentially at the center of the genetic cascades regulating vascular differentiation.

{"title": "Heparin mimetic peptide nanofibers promote angiogenesis.", "abstract": "New blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) is one of the most important processes required for functional tissue formation. Induction of angiogenesis is usually triggered by growth factors released by cells. Glycosaminoglycans (e.g., heparan sulphates) in the extracellular matrix aid in proper functioning of these growth factors. Therefore, exogeneous heparin or growth factors were required for promoting angiogenesis in previous regenerative medicine studies. Here we report for the first time induction of angiogenesis by a synthetic nanofibrous peptide scaffold without the addition of any exogenous growth factors or heparin. We designed and synthesized a self-assembling peptide amphiphile molecule that is functionalized with biologically active groups to mimic heparin. Like heparin, this molecule has the ability to interact with growth factors and effectively enhance their bioactivity. The nanofibers formed by these molecules were shown to form a 3D network mimicking the structural proteins in the extracellular matrix. Because of heparin mimicking capabilities of the peptide nanofibers, angiogenesis was induced without the addition of exogenous growth factors in vitro. Bioactive interactions between the nanofibers and the growth factors enabled robust vascularization in vivo as well. Heparin mimetic peptide nanofibers presented here provide new opportunities for angiogenesis and tissue regeneration by avoiding the use of heparin and exogenous growth factors.

This contrasts with first making a pattern for the mastopexy, resecting the skin, and then tailor tacking the tissues together. Over a 7-year period, 55\u00a0women had simultaneous augmentation mastopexy with this approach. Saline implants were placed in the subpectoral dual-plane position before the mastopexy was started. All surgeries were performed with the patient under general anesthesia, and the patients were discharged the same day. In a retrospective chart review, breast implant size, degree of preoperative asymmetry, length of procedure, and complications were recorded. The patient follow-up period ranged from 3\u00a0months to 7\u00a0years (median, 9\u00a0months).\nSymmetric, aesthetic results were achieved for all the patients. The range of saline implants used was 375-775\u00a0ml (average, 500\u00a0ml). Of the 55\u00a0women, 15 had two different size implants measuring at least 50 ml or larger, with the greatest size disparity in a patient being 225\u00a0ml (left breast, 700\u00a0ml; right breast, 475\u00a0ml). Six of the patients (10.9%) had small areas that healed by secondary intention, occurring mostly at the inferior junction of the inverted T. Only two patients (3.6%) had recurrence of breast ptosis, and only one patient (1.8%) had a mildly hypertrophic scar. There were no incidences of hematoma, infection, rippling, malposition of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC), NAC loss, capsular contraction, implant malposition, or dissatisfaction with implant size. The bilateral augmentation/mastopexy surgery time ranged from 2\u00a0h and 29\u00a0min to 4\u00a0h and 30\u00a0min (average, 3\u00a0h and 8\u00a0min).\nThe described technique maximizes the amount of tissue to be resected in simultaneous augmentation mastopexy for moderately to severely ptotic breasts. Symmetry is more easily achieved with this approach regardless of the implant size used or the amount of skin to be resected. This technique minimizes the chance of tissue necrosis from devascularized skin edges. It also may shorten the inverted T scar and reduce the operative time.", "journal": "Aesthetic plastic surgery", "date": "2011-08-20", "authors": ["TedEisenberg"], "doi": "10.1007/s00266-011-9796-7"}

{"title": "Interaction between granulosa-lutein cells and monocytes regulates secretion of angiogenic factors in vitro.", "abstract": "Leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis in the forming corpus luteum are prerequisites for normal ovarian function and may also underlie disorders like ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We examined whether ovarian angiogenesis could be affected by an interaction between granulosa-lutein (GL) cells and leukocytes.\nWe found that GL cells isolated from the follicular fluid synthesize and secrete the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), which activates IL-8-receptor-specific Ca(2+) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling in monocytes and induces a directed migration of these cells towards the chemical gradient. Monocytes were found to further enhance IL-8 release, which suggests that these cells promote a massive leukocyte infiltration of the forming corpus luteum. A possible utility of leukocyte infiltration is the modulation of angiogenesis. We found that GL cells induce migration and capillary tube formation by endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, monocytes altered the profile of angiogenic factors released by GL cells, which supports the theory that an interaction between GL cells and leukocytes regulates ovarian angiogenesis. In addition, we found a correlation between increased secretion of pro-angiogenic cytokines and number of oocytes collected during IVF, which suggests that ovarian angiogenesis is related to the clinical response during ovarian stimulation.\nAn intricate communication may exist between infiltrating leukocytes and ovarian GL cells during the formation of corpus luteum, affecting neo-vascularization of the luteal tissue.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2011-08-19", "authors": ["AnnaPo\u0142e\u0107", "MelindaR\u00e1ki", "Thomas\u00c5byholm", "Tom GTanbo", "PeterFedorcs\u00e1k"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/der216"}

Animals were transplanted with 500 islets and observed at 1, 4, 8 and 16 weeks post transplantation.

The authors developed a fibular vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation model in nonhuman primates to investigate healing and rejection patterns of bone and associated tissues.\nFive fibular vascularized composite tissue allotransplantations were performed between mismatched cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Vascularized fibular segments with associated muscle and skin were transplanted to recipient forearm radius defects. Recipients were treated with either tacrolimus monotherapy or tacrolimus plus co-stimulatory blockade with a novel anti-CD28 antibody. Animals were followed for 6 months with serial radiographs, blood sample collection, and biopsies. At the study endpoint, angiographic, biomechanical, histologic, and immunologic assays were performed.\nAll animals survived to the experimental endpoint of 180 days. Rapid or immediate skin loss was evident secondary to vascular compromise (n = 3) or rejection (n = 1) in four animals. Despite loss of nonbony segments and the development of transplant arteriopathy consistent with chronic rejection in two animals, serial radiologic imaging and histology demonstrated bone healing and donor-recipient bony union by 10 weeks in all animals. Histology confirmed the presence of viable cortical and marrow elements. Biomechanical analysis supported donor-recipient bony union. Short-tandem repeated genotypic analysis revealed that donor marrow had been completely replaced by recipient marrow.\nIn contrast to successes in extremity vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation, the authors' nonhuman primate fibular vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation model showed early skin loss, replacement of donor bone marrow, and chronic rejection.

Current methods are mainly through releasing angiogenesis-related factors (ARF) or seeding angiogenesis-related cells (ARC), but the efficacy of these methods is not satisfactory, because angiogenesis needs participation of multiple factors, extracellular matrix and related cells. The latest research has demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) originating from bone marrow and existing in peripheral blood are the key element participating in revascularization of adult tissues. They directly participate in both stem cell vasculogenesis of ischemic tissues and local angiogenesis.

At this time, the only definitive treatment of hepatic failure is orthotopic transplantation. However, there is a critical shortage of organs with the total waiting list for all organs currently at 100,000 requests. The number is increasing by 5% every year. Given that only organs in pristine condition are transplantable and that the hidden demand for organs as an anti-aging solution will be many times the current figures, orthotopic transplantation will always remain a limited pool. The increasing donor organ shortage requires consideration of alternative emerging technologies. Regenerative medicine may offer novel strategies to treat patients with end-stage organ failure. The ultimate aim of cell transplantation, tissue engineering, and stem cells is to regenerate tissues and organs. With the development of whole organ decellularization methods, the equation of organ shortage may dramatically change in the near future. Decellularized organs provide the ideal transplantable scaffold with all the necessary microstructure and extracellular cues for cell attachment, differentiation, vascularization, and function.

In case of bone, this requires the synthesis of three-dimensional constructs able to exchange chemical signals promoting osteogenesis and to progressively be resorbed during the formation and remodelling of new bone. Besides, particularly for the regeneration of extensive portions of bone, a morphological and mechanical biomimesis is also required, to allow cell colonization and formation of a proper vascularization tree. The healing of load-bearing bones also requires scaffolds with a hierarchically organized morphology, to provide improved biomechanical behaviour and allow a proper mechano-transduction of the mechanical stimuli down to the cell level. The present paper is an overview of the current technologies and devices developed in the last decade for the regeneration of bone tissue.

We studied 14S,21R-diHDHA generation from macrophages using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The role in macrophage-mediated wound healing functions was determined using a murine splinted excisional wound healing model and in vitro assays. 14S,21R-diHDHA acts as a macrophage-generated autacoid, and its attenuated formation in macrophages of diabetic db/db mice was accompanied by impairment of macrophage prohealing functions. 14S,21R-diHDHA restored db/db macrophage-impaired prohealing functions by promoting wound re-epithelialization, formulation of granulation tissue, and vascularization. Additionally, 12/15-lipoxygenase-deficient macrophages, which are unable to produce 14S,21R-diHDHA, exhibited impaired prohealing functions, which also were restored by 14S,21R-diHDHA treatment. The molecular mechanism for 14S,21R-diHDHA-induced recovery of impaired prohealing functions of db/db macrophages involves enhancing their secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor BB, decreasing hyperglycemia-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, and increasing IL-10 expression under inflammatory stimulation. Taken together, these results indicate that deficiency of 14S,21R-diHDHA formation by diabetic macrophages contributes to their impaired prohealing functions.

Yet the mechanism by which implanted vascular networks inosculate, or anastomose, with the host vasculature has been unknown, making it difficult to develop optimized strategies for facilitating perfusion. Here we show that implanted vascular networks anastomose with host vessels through a previously unidentified process of \"wrapping and tapping\" between the engrafted endothelial cells (ECs) and the host vasculature. At the host-implant interface, implanted ECs first wrap around nearby host vessels and then cause basement membrane and pericyte reorganization and localized displacement of the underlying host endothelium. In this way, the implanted ECs replace segments of host vessels to divert blood flow to the developing implanted vascular network. The process is facilitated by high levels of matrix metalloproteinase-14 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expressed by the wrapping ECs.

Furthermore, non-responder patients are candidate to radical cystectomy in the absence of valuable alternative options. These aspects have prompted the search for newer biological response modifiers (BRM) with a better benefit/side effects ratio. The toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand, Helicobacter pylori protein HP-NAP, has been shown to deserve a potential role as BRM. HP-NAP is capable of driving the differentiation of T helper (Th) 1 cells, both in vitro and in vivo, because of its ability to create an IL-12-enriched milieu.

The effect is accompanied by a significant accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells, within tumour and regional lymph nodes.

Vascularizing the tumor: TRP channels as molecular targets.", "abstract": "Tumor vascularization is a critical process that determines tumor growth and metastasis. In the last decade new experimental evidence obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies have challenged the classical angiogenesis model forcing us to consider new scenarios for tumor neovascularization. In particular, the genetic stability of tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) has been recently questioned in several studies, which show that TECs, as well as pericytes, differ significantly from their normal counterparts at genetic and functional levels. In addition to such an epigenetic action of tumor microenvironment on endothelial cells (ECs) commitment, the distinct characteristics of TECs could be due to differences in their origin compared with preexisting differentiated ECs. Intracellular Ca(2+) signals are involved at different critical phases in the regulation of the complex process of angiogenesis and tumor progression. These signals are generated by a wide variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Several key components of Ca(2+) signaling including Ca(2+) channels in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, calcium pumps, and mitochondria contribute to the generation, amplitude, and frequency of these Ca(2+) change. In particular, several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of calcium-permeable channels have profound effects on the function of ECs. Because of its multifaceted role in the control of cell function, proliferation, and motility, TRP channels have been suggested as a potential molecular target for control of tumor neovascularization. Since plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels are easily and directly accessible via the bloodstream, they are potential targets for a number of pharmacological and antibody-targeted therapeutic strategies, with specificity being the main limitation.

Mouse inactivation of the Tis11b gene has revealed disorganization of the vascular network and up-regulation of the proangiogenic factor VEGF. However, the VEGF deregulation alone cannot explain the phenotype of Tis11b knockouts. Therefore we investigated the role of Tis11b in expression of Dll4, another angiogenic gene for which haploinsufficiency is lethal. In this paper, we show that Tis11b silencing in endothelial cells leads to up-regulation of Dll4 protein and mRNA expressions, indicating that Dll4 is a physiological target of Tis11b. Tis11b protein binds to endogenous Dll4 mRNA, and represses mRNA expression without affecting its stability. In the Dll4 mRNA 3' untranslated region, we identified one particular AUUUA motif embedded in a weak noncanonical polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal as the major Tis11b-binding site. Moreover, we observed that inhibition of Tis11b expression changes the ratio between mRNAs that are cleaved or read through at the poly(A) signal position, suggesting that Tis11b can interfere with mRNA cleavage and poly(A) efficiency.

Given the conflicting role of angiopoietin-like-4 (ANGPTL4) reported in the current literature using gain of function systems both in vitro and in vivo, the goal of this study was to characterize angiogenesis, focusing on perinatal retinal vascularization and pathological circumstances in angpl4-deficient mice. We report altered organization of endothelial junctions and pericyte coverage, both leading to impaired angiogenesis and increased vascular leakage that were eventually caught up, suggesting a delay in vessel maturation. In a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, pathological neovascularization, which results from tissue hypoxia, was also strongly inhibited in angptl4-deficient mice.

Cell printing and prevascularization of engineered tissues are promising approaches to meet these challenges. However, the printing technologies used in biofabrication must balance the competing parameters of resolution, speed, and volume, which limit the resolution of thicker 3D structures.

Supernatants from TS/A WT cells, but not those from TS/A 1B8, generated tip cells and promoted the permeability of primary human umbilical vein ECs, via VE-cadherin redistribution and cytoskeletal disorganization. These effects were abrogated by mAb 5A8, a VS-1-blocking antibody. Furthermore, VS-1 inhibited hypoxia-driven EC morphological changes, VE-cadherin redistribution, intercellular gap formation, tube morphogenesis, and HIF-1\u03b1 nuclear translocation in vitro. Our findings highlight a previously undescribed function of VS-1 as a regulator of tumor vascularization.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2011-08-10", "authors": ["LorenzoVeschini", "LucaCrippa", "EleonoraDondossola", "ClaudioDoglioni", "AngeloCorti", "ElisabettaFerrero"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.11-182410"}

Lapachol, [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl and BiCl(3) were evaluated in a murine model of inflammatory angiogenesis induced by subcutaneous implantation of polyether polyurethane sponge discs. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of lapachol or [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl reduced the hemoglobin content in the implants suggesting that reduction of neo-vascularization was caused by lapachol. In the per os treatment only [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl decreased the hemoglobin content in the implants. Likewise, N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity decreased in the implants of the groups i.p. treated with lapachol and [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl while in the per os treatment inhibition was observed only for [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl. Histological analysis showed that the components of the fibro-vascular tissue (vascularization and inflammatory cell population) were decreased in lapachol- and complex-treated groups. Our results suggest that both lapachol and [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl exhibit anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities which have been attributed to the presence of the lapachol ligand.

Materials and Methods. This was a phantom study, involving volume measurements carried out by two operators using SPECT and SPECT/CT images. The percentage of error for each method was calculated, and interobserver reproducibility was evaluated. A treatment using Therasphere was planned in a patient with three hepatic arteries, and the quantitative analysis of SPECT/CT for this patient is provided. Results. SPECT/CT volume measurements proved to be accurate (mean error <6% for volumes \u226516\u2009cm(3)) and reproductive (interobserver agreement = 0.9). In the case report, (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT/CT identified a large liver volume, not previously identified with angiography, which was shown to be vascularized after selective MAA injection into an arterial branch, resulting in a large modification in the activity of Therasphere used.

{"title": "Sensitized recipients exhibit accelerated but not hyperacute rejection of vascularized composite tissue allografts.", "abstract": "Currently, the donor-recipient matching process for vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation (VCTA) closely follows the standard practices for solid organ transplantation. Sensitization is considered a contraindication to VCTA. However, the role of sensitization in VCTA rejection is largely unstudied.\nMajor histocompatibility-mismatched ACI (RT1) donors and Wistar Furth (WF) (RT1) recipients were used to determine whether sensitization would lead to hyperacute rejection in VCTA as in other organs, such as kidneys. WF rats were presensitized to ACI antigens by skin transplantation and received heterotopic osteomyocutaneous VCTA flaps. Kidney transplants served as controls.\nProduction of anti-donor antibody was detected in WF recipients after rejection of the ACI skin grafts. Sensitized WF rats rejected VCTA grafts from ACI rats significantly faster (P<0.05) than unsensitized recipients, but not hyperacutely. Rejection in the sensitized recipients was not prevented by immunosuppression with FK506 and mycophenolate mofetil. In contrast, kidney allografts from ACI rats were hyperacutely rejected within 30 min by sensitized recipients. To confirm the role of antibody-mediated rejection in the sensitized recipients, serum from presensitized rats was adoptively transferred into na\u00efve WF rats. Hyperacute rejection occurred only in transplanted kidneys but not VCTA. Histologic examination of tissues from acceleratedly rejected VCTA showed dense lymphocytic infiltrates, and no antibody deposition.\nVCTA are rejected in an accelerated fashion but not hyperacutely in the presence of allosensitization and preformed anti-donor antibody.

{"title": "Scaffold vascularization in\u00a0vivo driven by primary human osteoblasts in concert with host inflammatory cells.", "abstract": "Successful cell-based tissue engineering requires a rapid and thorough vascularization in order to ensure long-term implant survival and tissue integration. The vascularization of a scaffold is a complex process, and is modulated by the presence of transplanted cells, exogenous and endogenous signaling proteins, and the host tissue reaction, among other influencing factors. This paper presents evidence for the significance of pre-seeded osteoblasts for the in vivo vascularization of a biodegradable scaffold. Human osteoblasts, cultured on silk fibroin micronets in vitro, migrated throughout the interconnected pores of the scaffold and produced extensive bone matrix. When these constructs were implanted in SCID mice, a rapid and thorough vascularization of the scaffold by the host blood capillaries occurred. This profound response was not seen for the silk fibroin scaffold alone. Moreover, when the pre-cultivation time of human osteoblasts was reduced from 14 days to only 24 h, the significant effect these cells exerted on vascularization rate in vivo was still detectable. From these studies, we conclude that matrix and soluble factors produced by osteoblasts can serve to instruct host endothelial cells to migrate, proliferate, and initiate the process of scaffold vascularization. This finding represents a potential paradigm shift for the field of tissue engineering, especially in bone, as traditional strategies to enhance scaffold vascularization have focused on endovascular cells and regarded osteoblasts primarily as cell targets for mineralization. In addition, the migration of host macrophages and multinucleated giant cells into the scaffold was also found to influence the vascularization of the biomaterial. Therefore, the robust effect on scaffold vascularization seen by pre-culturing with osteoblasts appears to occur in concert with the pro-angiogenic stimuli arising from host immune cells.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-08-09", "authors": ["ShahramGhanaati", "Ronald EUnger", "Matthew JWebber", "MikeBarbeck", "CarinaOrth", "Jenny AKirkpatrick", "PatrickBooms", "AntonellaMotta", "ClaudioMigliaresi", "Robert ASader", "C JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.041"}

Specimens of 15 control, 20 leiomyoma, and 23 EC patients were investigated immunohistochemically using anti-CD31 and anti-tryptase antibodies. In EC, both stromal and myometrial expressions of CD31 were significantly higher than in the controls (p<0.01 and p=0.013; respectively). Stromal tryptase expression was not significantly lower than that of leiomyoma. In addition, in the leiomyoma group, CD31 and tryptase expressions were not much different compared to the controls. Moreover, a correlation was detected between cancer histological grade and both stromal and myometrial expressions of CD31 (p=0.017 and p=0.005; respectively). The findings show that high grade EC has a higher degree of vascularization than EC of lower grade, but MCD does not increase in parallel with the histological grade. This study has demonstrated that MCD does not correlate with angiogenesis and progression of grade in EC. Moreover, MCD in EC was found to be lower than in benign lesions of the uterus.

Creating a functional vascular network is an important concern so as to ensure vitality in regenerated tissues. Many strategies were developed to achieve this goal. One of these is cellular growth technique by perfusion bioreactor chamber. These new technical requirements came along with improved media and chamber receptacles: bioreactors (chapter 2). Some bone tissue engineering processes already have clinical applications but for volumes limited by the lack of vascularisation. Resorbable or non-resorbable membranes are an example. They are used separately or in association with bone grafts and they protect the graft during the revascularization process. Potentiated osseous regeneration uses molecular or cellular adjuvants (BMPs and autologous stem cells) to improve osseous healing. Significant improvements were made: integration of specific sequences, which may guide and enhance cells differentiation in scaffold; nano- or micro-patterned cell containing scaffolds. Finally, some authors consider the patient body as an ideal bioreactor to induce vascularisation in large volumes of grafted tissues. \"Endocultivation\", i.e., cellular culture inside the human body was proven to be feasible and safe.

In many cases, repeated osseous exposition and infection may occur. The currently recommended management of affected patients is antibiotic treatment and bony decortication, which is often complicated by soft tissue deficits due to chronic infection. In severe cases osteonecrosis can be managed often only by continuity resections of the mandible. For this purpose, we developed a new surgical procedure, which allows an effective closure of difficult jaw wounds in the lateral mandible. In the last 3 years, 20 patients with BP-associated osteonecrosis of the lower jaw were treated successfully with a modified defect-covering method using a myofascial flap. A mylohyoid muscle flap was detached from mylohyoid line and used to cover the bony defect. During 19 months mean follow-up, 90% of patients were asymptomatic, the oral mucosa was intact, and no exposed bone was observed. In consequence, we are able to demonstrate that a mylohyoid muscle flap provides a reliable wound closure in the lower jaw in patients treated with BPs. Although there are still no consensual therapy guidelines for patients affected by BP-associated ONJ, the results of the presented study provide evidence for an effective surgical therapy with long-term success.

In the last 20 years awareness of a subset of squamous cell carcinomas induced by oncogenic forms of the human papilloma virus (HPV) (high-risk types 16 and 18) has increased. The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer is rising, indicating the increased importance of the viral etiology. Cell proliferation, migration, induction of tumor vascularization and carcinogenesis, as well as invasion facilitation is regulated by a variety of angiogenic peptides like PDGF, PDGF-R and VEGF. They might be an encouraging target for biological anticancer therapy by inhibiting disrupted cellular signaling pathways. Imatinib has been shown to target specific tyrosine kinases, inhibiting proliferation in various cancer entities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression pattern of angiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF and PDGF-R) in HPV-positive (p16-CERV196 SCC) and (-negative squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The study also evaluated the vulnerability of anti-angiogenesis therapy depending on the HPV status as potential treatment modality compared to established platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs. The different squamous tumor cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of carboplatin (3 and 7.5 \u00b5mol) and imatinib (18 and 30 \u00b5mol). ELISA immunohistochemical methods were carried out after 48, 72, 120, 192 and 240 h. We demonstrated a significant reduction of VEGF and PDGF-R\u03b1/\u03b2 expression patterns after incubation of imatinib in ELISA and immunohistochemical methods, irrespective of the HPV status of the tumor cells, whereas the application of carboplatin had no impact on the expression of angiogenic peptides. Viral oncogen-transformed squamous cell carcinoma (CERV196) cells were characterized by a reduced susceptibility for an imatinib-altered VEGF expression. Further studies are planned to investigate this observance in HPV-positive HNSCC in vitro. The implementation of a selective molecular anti-angiogenic therapy in established chemotherapeutic regimens may enhance the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy without an increased toxicity profile and could thus improve the clinical outcome in HNSCC, irrespective of the HPV status.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2011-08-02", "authors": ["J DSchultz", "KM\u00fchlheim", "PErben", "R DHofheinz", "AFaber", "CThorn", "J USommer", "KH\u00f6rmann", "ASauter"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2011.1403"}
{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cell-dependent angiogenesis requires localization of the full-length form of uPAR in caveolae.", "abstract": "Endothelial urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is thought to provide a regulatory mechanism in angiogenesis. Here we studied the proangiogenic role of uPAR in endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), a cell population identified in human umbilical blood that embodies all of the properties of an endothelial progenitor cell matched with a high proliferative rate. By using caveolae-disrupting agents and by caveolin-1 silencing, we have shown that the angiogenic properties of ECFCs depend on caveolae integrity and on the presence of full-length uPAR in such specialized membrane invaginations. Inhibition of uPAR expression by antisense oligonucleotides promoted caveolae disruption, suggesting that uPAR is an inducer of caveolae organization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoted accumulation of uPAR in ECFC caveolae in its undegraded form. We also demonstrated that VEGF-dependent ERK phosphorylation required integrity of caveolae as well as caveolar uPAR expression. VEGF activity depends on inhibition of ECFC MMP12 production, which results in impairment of MMP12-dependent uPAR truncation. Further, MMP12 overexpression in ECFC inhibited vascularization in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that intratumor homing of ECFCs suitably engineered to overexpress MMP12 could have the chance to control uPAR-dependent activities required for tumor angiogenesis and malignant cells spreading.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2011-08-02", "authors": ["FrancescaMargheri", "AnastasiaChill\u00e0", "AnnaLaurenzana", "SimonaSerrat\u00ec", "BenedettaMazzanti", "RiccardoSaccardi", "MichelaSantosuosso", "GiovannaDanza", "Niccol\u00f2Sturli", "FabianaRosati", "LuciaMagnelli", "LauraPapucci", "LidoCalorini", "FrancescaBianchini", "MarioDel Rosso", "GabriellaFibbi"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2011-02-338681"}

Acellular scaffolds derived from organ decellularization are promising, widely used biomaterials for tissue engineering. However, the acellular skeletal muscle extra cellular matrix (ECM) has been poorly characterized in terms of production, storage and host-donor interactions. We have produced acellular scaffolds at the whole organ scale from various skeletal muscles explanted from mice. The acellular scaffolds conserve chemical and architectural features of the tissue of origin, including the vascular bed. Scaffolds can be sterilely stored for weeks at\u00a0+4\u00b0C or\u00a0+37\u00b0C in tissue culture grade conditions. When transplanted in wt mice, the grafts are stable for several weeks, whilst being colonized by inflammatory and stem cells. We demonstrate that the acellular scaffold per se represents a pro-myogenic environment supporting de novo formation of muscle fibers, likely derived from host cells with myogenic potential.

Current approaches still lack a network of perfusable vessels with native 3D structural organization. Here we present a new method combining self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-based cell transfer and gelatin methacrylate hydrogel photopatterning techniques for microengineering vascular structures. Human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC) transfer from oligopeptide SAM-coated surfaces to the hydrogel revealed two SAM desorption mechanisms: photoinduced and electrochemically triggered. The former, occurs concomitantly to hydrogel photocrosslinking, and resulted in efficient (>97%) monolayer transfer. The latter, prompted by additional potential application, preserved cell morphology and maintained high transfer efficiency of VE-cadherin positive monolayers over longer culture periods. This approach was also applied to transfer HUVECs to 3D geometrically defined vascular-like structures in hydrogels, which were then maintained in perfusion culture for 15 days. As a step toward more complex constructs, a cell-laden hydrogel layer was photopatterned around the endothelialized channel to mimic the vascular smooth muscle structure of distal arterioles. This study shows that the coupling of the SAM-based cell transfer and hydrogel photocrosslinking could potentially open up new avenues in engineering more complex, vascularized tissue constructs for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-08-02", "authors": ["NasserSadr", "MojunZhu", "TatsuyaOsaki", "TakahiroKakegawa", "YunzhiYang", "MatteoMoretti", "JunjiFukuda", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.034"}

The inhibitory effect of IGFBP7 on U87MG cell growth was further assessed in vivo using U87MG cells grafted on the chick chorioallantoic membrane. In this model, U87MG cells formed solid and highly vascularized tumors that were reduced in size (~40%) when treated with 500 nM IGFBP7 compared with control tumors. Vessels in IGFBP7-treated tumors were clustered, unevenly distributed and associated with higher number of \u03b1-SMA positive cells compared with those in untreated tumors.

On average, relative leaf growth rate was increased 16% in the Y831F plants (in the bri1-5 background), and the gain of function of the Y831F-directed mutant was dominant in the wild-type background. Leaves were larger as a result of increased cell numbers and had substantially increased vascularization. Transcriptome analysis indicated that genes associated with brassinolide biosynthesis, secondary cell wall biosynthesis and vascular development, and regulation of growth were altered in expression and may contribute to the observed changes in leaf architecture and whole plant growth. Analysis of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence indicated that Y831F mutant plants had higher rates of photosynthesis, and metabolite analysis documented enhanced accumulation of starch, sucrose, and several amino acids, most prominently glycine and proline.

Those metastases normally appear as hypoechoic or even anechoic lesions on sonography. It has been assumed that this appearance is due to necrosis of the lesions, but so far, that assumption has never been proven. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate whether the hypoechoic appearance of melanoma metastasis is really due to tumor necrosis.\nFrom a radiographic database, we retrieved 212 melanoma cases imaged with sonography over a 2-year period for disease staging or follow-up. We selected 37 positive cases with 84 nodal and extranodal (satellite and in-transit) metastatic lesions and reviewed the sonograms and pathologic slides (slides available for 40 of 84 lesions). We retrospectively assessed the vascularization pattern (color Doppler images available for 78 of 84 lesions), categorizing it as poor, intermediate, or consistent. We also looked for necrosis on the histopathologic material, categorizing it into scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 for absence of necrosis, less than 20% necrosis, 20% to 40% necrosis, and greater than 40% necrosis, respectively.\nDespite their gray scale appearance, most melanoma lesions were vascularized on color Doppler imaging and showed limited necrosis at histopathologic analysis. Consistent vascularization on Doppler imaging, excluding substantial necrosis, was found in 44 of 78 lesions (56.4%). Poor vascularization on Doppler imaging, suggesting necrosis, was present in only 14% of the lesions. Substantial necrosis (scores of 2 and 3) was found pathologically in only 10% of the lesions.\nNecrosis seems to be an uncommon event in melanoma metastasis and is probably not the basis for its low-level echo pattern on sonography. The hypoechoic appearance is very typical of melanoma metastasis and is likely due to massive melanomatous infiltration (with the poor echo reflectivity of melanin).

First, DNA from five different sites of the identical membrane showed the same genotypes at either of two loci examined. Second, DNA from the membrane of each full-sibling birds and blood of their parents showed the genotypes that were consistent with Mendelian parent-offspring relationships at any of eight loci examined.

{"title": "Physical and functional interactions between Runx2 and HIF-1\u03b1 induce vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis and bone formation are intimately related processes. Hypoxia during early bone development stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and increases angiogenic signals including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Furthermore, stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 by genetic or chemical means stimulates bone formation. On the other hand, deficiency of Runx2, a key osteogenic transcription factor, prevents vascular invasion of bone and VEGF expression. This study explores the possibility that HIF-1\u03b1 and Runx2 interact to activate angiogenic signals. Runx2 over-expression in mesenchymal cells increased VEGF mRNA and protein under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In normoxia, Runx2 also dramatically increased HIF-1\u03b1 protein. In all cases, the Runx2 response was inhibited by siRNA-mediated suppression of HIF-1\u03b1 and completely blocked by the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor, echinomycin. Similarly, treatment of preosteoblast cells with Runx2 siRNA reduced VEGF mRNA in normoxia or hypoxia. However, Runx2 is not essential for the HIF-1\u03b1 response since VEGF is induced by hypoxia even in Runx2-null cells. Endogenous Runx2 and HIF-1\u03b1 were colocalized to the nuclei of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells. Moreover, HIF-1\u03b1 and Runx2 physically interact using sites within the Runx2 RUNT domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation also provided evidence for colocalization of Runx2 and HIF-1\u03b1 on the VEGF promoter. In addition, Runx2 stimulated HIF-1\u03b1-dependent activation of an HRE-luciferase reporter gene without requiring a separate Runx2-binding enhancer. These studies indicate that Runx2 functions together with HIF-1\u03b1 to stimulate angiogenic gene expression in bone cells and may in part explain the known requirement for Runx2 in bone vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2011-07-28", "authors": ["Tae-GeonKwon", "XiangZhao", "QianYang", "YanLi", "ChunxiGe", "GuishengZhao", "Renny TFranceschi"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.23289\n10.1038/mt.2011.101"}

Active angiogenesis and metastasis are responsible for rapid recurrence and poor survival of HCC. We previously found that microRNA-29b (miR-29b) down-regulation was significantly associated with poor recurrence-free survival of HCC patients. Therefore, the role of miR-29b in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis was further investigated in this study using in vitro capillary tube formation and transwell assays, in vivo subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft mouse models, and Matrigel plug assay, and human HCC samples. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-29b dramatically suppressed the ability of HCC cells to promote capillary tube formation of endothelial cells and to invade extracellular matrix gel in vitro. Using mouse models, we revealed that tumors derived from miR-29b-expressed HCC cells displayed significant reduction in microvessel density and in intrahepatic metastatic capacity compared with those from the control group. Subsequent investigations revealed that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was a direct target of miR-29b. The blocking of MMP-2 by neutralizing antibody or RNA interference phenocopied the antiangiogenesis and antiinvasion effects of miR-29b, whereas introduction of MMP-2 antagonized the function of miR-29b. We further disclosed that miR-29b exerted its antiangiogenesis function, at least partly, by suppressing MMP-2 expression in tumor cells and, in turn, impairing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-signaling in endothelial cells. Consistently, in human HCC tissues and mouse xenograft tumors miR-29b level was inversely correlated with MMP-2 expression, as well as tumor angiogenesis, venous invasion, and metastasis.\nmiR-29b deregulation contributes to angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of HCC.

This technique was introduced into the clinic some 10 years ago as a means of avoiding the mutilation of a total laryngectomy in selected patients with laryngeal cancer. Our goal was to give the morphometric guidelines that guarantee an optimal functional outcome.\nRetrospective case study.\nWe morphometrically evaluated the structure and function of the larynx after autotransplantation. The close anatomic relationship between the larynx and the trachea made it possible to perform a morphometric analysis of the defect and the repair tissue before and after transplantation. Computed tomography images were used to measure the laryngeal and tracheal airway lumen and the length and width of the tracheal autotransplant. A 4-cm long cartilaginous tracheal transplant was available for reconstruction.\nLaryngeal repair was achieved with optimal restoration of the airway lumen at all laryngeal levels. We used the maximal amount of trachea that might reasonably be available for autotransplantation. This optimal morphologic repair led to the restoration of speech, swallowing, and respiratory functions.\nThis study highlights a standardized approach for repairing a hemilaryngeal defect and selecting the appropriate amount of repair tissue.

Anterior approaches remain challenging, however, because of the considerable risk of vascular injury.

After implantation, the triphasic bone-substitute material was present as a bulk-like structure with an inner and outer core.

The implantation bed of the \u03b2-TCP granule control group was invaded by phagocytes and formed a poorly vascularized connective tissue soon after implantation. This inflammatory response continued throughout the study period and filled the implantation bed. Significantly, the combination of the three biocompatible materials into one injectable paste-like bone-substitute material enabled modification of the tissue reaction to the implant and resulted in a longer in vivo lifetime than that of \u03b2-TCP granules alone.

The aim of this study was to identify the origination of the vasculature during skin graft revascularization in vivo and to track vessel development over time.\nWe created a crossover wild-type/GFP skin transplantation model, in which each animal carried the graft from the other strain. The preparation of the modified dorsal skin fold chamber including cross-over skin grafting was performed in male C57BL/6J wild-type mice (n=5) and C57BL/6-Tg(ACTB-EGFP)1O sb/J mice (n=5). Intravital microscopy in 12 areas of wild-type and GFP skin grafts was performed daily over a time period of 10 days.\nGraft reperfusion started after 48-72 h. After reperfusion GFP-positive structures from the wound bed were visible in the graft capillaries with the highest density in the center of the graft. Overall, we observed a replacement of existing graft capillaries with vessels from the wound bed in 68% of the vessels. Of note, vessel replacement occurred in almost 100% of graft vessels in the periphery. Additionally, vessels within the graft showed a temporary angiogenic response between days 3-8, which originated predominantly from the autochthonous graft vasculature, but also contained already grown-in vessels from the wound bed.\nThese in vivo data indicate an early in-growth of angiogenic bed vessels into the existing vascular channels of the graft and subsequent centripetal replacement. Additionally we observed a temporary angiogenic response of the autochthonous capillaries of the skin graft with contribution from bed vessels. These findings further support the theory that sprouting angiogenesis from the wound bed in combination with the replacement of existing graft vessels are the key factors in skin graft taking.

However, the mechanism by which IL-17 mediates angiogenesis is undefined. Therefore, the pathologic role of CXCL1 and CXCL5 was investigated in arthritis mediated by local expression of IL-17, employing a neutralizing antibody to each chemokine. Next, endothelial chemotaxis was utilized to examine whether endothelial migration was differentially mediated by CXCL1 and CXCL5. Our results demonstrate that IL-17-mediated disease activity was not affected by anti-CXCL1 treatment alone. In contrast, mice receiving anti-CXCL5 demonstrated significantly reduced clinical signs of arthritis, compared to the mice treated with IgG control. Consistently, while inflammation, synovial lining thickness, bone erosion and vascularization were markedly reduced in both the anti-CXCL5 and combination anti-CXCL1 and 5 treatment groups, mice receiving anti-CXCL1 antibody had clinical scores similar to the control group. In contrast to joint FGF2 and VEGF levels, TNF-\u03b1 was significantly reduced in mice receiving anti-CXCL5 or combination of anti-CXCL1 and 5 therapies compared to the control group. We found that, like IL-17, CXCL1-induced endothelial migration is mediated through activation of PI3K. In contrast, activation of NF-\u03baB pathway was essential for endothelial chemotaxis induced by CXCL5. Although CXCL1 and CXCL5 can differentially mediate endothelial trafficking, blockade of CXCR2 can inhibit endothelial chemotaxis mediated by either of these chemokines.

We recently described vascular heterogeneity in tumours derived from cell clones of a human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) strain (hMSC-TERT20) immortalized by retroviral vector mediated human telomerase (hTERT) gene expression. Histological analysis showed that cells of the most vascularized tumorigenic clone, -BD11 had a pericyte-like alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA+) and CD146+ positive phenotype. Upon serum withdrawal in culture, -BD11 cells formed cord-like structures mimicking capillary morphogenesis. In contrast, cells of the poorly tumorigenic clone, -BC8 did not stain for ASMA, tumours were less vascularized and serum withdrawal in culture led to cell death. By exploring the heterogeneity in hMSC-TERT20 clones we aimed to understand molecular mechanisms by which mesenchymal stem cells may promote neovascularization.\nQuantitative qRT-PCR analysis revealed similar mRNA levels for genes encoding the angiogenic cytokines VEGF and Angiopoietin-1 in both clones. However, clone-BD11 produced a denser extracellular matrix that supported stable ex vivo capillary morphogenesis of human endothelial cells and promoted in vivo neovascularization. Proteomic characterization of the -BD11 decellularized matrix identified 50 extracellular angiogenic proteins, including galectin-1. siRNA knock down of galectin-1 expression abrogated the ex vivo interaction between decellularized -BD11 matrix and endothelial cells.

{"title": "MicroRNA regulation in angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The term angiogenesis derives from the Greek words 'angeio' meaning blood vessel, and 'genesis' meaning production or birth, together referring to the creation of blood vessels within the body. This term has been used to generally indicate the growth and remodeling process of the primitive vascular network into a complex network during pre-natal development. After birth, reparative angiogenesis is activated during wound healing and in response to ischemia, while pathological angiogenesis contributes to tumor growth and metastasis, arthritis and ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small, non-coding RNAs that control gene expression by acting on target mRNAs for promoting either their degradation or translational repression. There is increasing evidence that miRNAs play important roles in vascular development as well as in vascular diseases. In this review, we aim at describing the role of miRNAs in angiogenesis, focusing, in particular, on post-ischemic neovascularization. First, we will describe the regulation and the expression of miRNAs in endothelial cells. Then, we will analyze the role of miRNAs in reparative and pathological angiogenesis. Finally, we will discuss the innovative strategies available to inhibit the level of pathogenic anti-angiogenic miRNAs and to increase expression of therapeutic miRNAs.", "journal": "Vascular pharmacology", "date": "2011-07-23", "authors": ["AndreaCaporali", "CostanzaEmanueli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vph.2011.06.006"}
{"title": "Bioengineering human microvascular networks in immunodeficient mice.", "abstract": "The future of tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for tissue regeneration will likely rely on our ability to generate functional vascular networks in vivo. In this regard, the search for experimental models to build blood vessel networks in vivo is of utmost importance. The feasibility of bioengineering microvascular networks in vivo was first shown using human tissue-derived mature endothelial cells (ECs); however, such autologous endothelial cells present problems for wide clinical use, because they are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities and require harvesting from existing vasculature. These limitations have instigated the search for other sources of ECs. The identification of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) in blood presented an opportunity to non-invasively obtain ECs (5-7). We and other authors have shown that adult and cord blood-derived ECFCs have the capacity to form functional vascular networks in vivo. Importantly, these studies have also shown that to obtain stable and durable vascular networks, ECFCs require co-implantation with perivascular cells. The assay we describe here illustrates this concept: we show how human cord blood-derived ECFCs can be combined with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a single cell suspension in a collagen/fibronectin/fibrinogen gel to form a functional human vascular network within 7 days after implantation into an immunodeficient mouse. The presence of human ECFC-lined lumens containing host erythrocytes can be seen throughout the implants indicating not only the formation (de novo) of a vascular network, but also the development of functional anastomoses with the host circulatory system. This murine model of bioengineered human vascular network is ideally suited for studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human vascular network formation and for the development of strategies to vascularize engineered tissues.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2011-07-22", "authors": ["Ruei-ZengLin", "Juan MMelero-Martin"], "doi": "10.3791/3065"}

Here, we demonstrate the mechanism of C-1311 inhibitory action on novel targets: hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and angiogenesis. In a cell-free system, C-1311 prevented HIF-1\u03b1 binding to an oligonucleotide encompassing a canonical hypoxia-responsive element (HRE), but did not directly interfere with HIF-1\u03b1 protein. Whereas C-1311 did not affect HIF-1\u03b1 transcription, at higher concentrations (10 \u00b5M), it decreased HIF-1\u03b1 protein accumulation. Furthermore, C-1311 potently reduced the transcription of HIF-1-dependent reporter gene as well as endogenous HIF-1 target gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor. In colon cancer HCT116 and murine melanoma B16/F10 cells, C-1311-induced down-regulation of VEGF, resulted in decreased VEGF protein expression. C-1311 did not alter normoxic VEGF secretion. Consistent with VEGF depletion, C-1311 significantly affected angiogenesis in vivo. A single dose of C-1311 (40 mg/kg), inhibited angiogenesis by 70%, as measured by vascularization of Matrigel plugs in mice. Continuous low C-1311 dosing (8 mg/kg/day for 5 days) gave similar inhibition of angiogenesis (80%), suggesting that low-dose, frequent C-1311 administration may be more effective in terms of reducing toxicity. Anti-angiogenic activity of C-1311 was further demonstrated in an experimental model in which B16/F10 cells were encapsulated in alginate beads and implanted into mice. C-1311 (8 mg/kg/day for 9 days), completely abrogated vascularization of the alginate implants.

We have previously described angiogenesis, aberrant vascularization, and BBB alteration in drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we investigated the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in an in vitro integrative model of vascular remodeling induced by epileptiform activity in rat organotypic hippocampal cultures. After kainate-induced seizure-like events (SLEs), we observed an overexpression of VEGF and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) as well as receptor activation. Vascular density and branching were significantly increased, whereas zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), a key protein of tight junctions (TJs), was downregulated. These effects were fully prevented by VEGF neutralization. Using selective inhibitors of VEGFR-2 signaling pathways, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is involved in cell survival, protein kinase C (PKC) in vascularization, and Src in ZO-1 regulation. Recombinant VEGF reproduced the kainate-induced vascular changes. As in the kainate model, VEGFR-2 and Src were involved in ZO-1 downregulation. These results showed that VEGF/VEGFR-2 initiates the vascular remodeling induced by SLEs and pointed out the roles of PKC in vascularization and Src in TJ dysfunction, respectively. This suggests that Src pathway could be a therapeutic target for BBB protection in epilepsies.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2011-07-22", "authors": ["M\u00e9lanieMorin-Brureau", "AuroreLebrun", "Marie-ClaudeRousset", "LaurentFagni", "Jo\u00eblBockaert", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricde Bock", "MireilleLerner-Natoli"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5692-10.2011"}

The main advantage of a bioresorbable plate over the typical metallic plate is that it will resorb after fusion has occurred, thus mitigating any long-term instrumentation-related complications. Furthermore, the plates are radiolucent, allowing complete visualization of the fusion site and eliminating imaging artifact.\nTo evaluate radiographic fusion, mechanical success rates, and histologic characteristics of a bioresorbable containment plate and screws in a 3-month ovine model of ACDF.\nAn in\u00a0vivo prospective analysis of resorbable anterior cervical plates and screws for use in ACDF in an ovine model.\nSix sheep underwent C2-C3 and C4-C5 discectomies. Fusions were performed using a polyetheretherketone cage filled with autograft bone. A polymeric plate (70/30 poly-dl-lactic acid), and four screws were placed over an intervertebral disc spacer at each of these two levels. After 3 months, the animals were euthanized and radiographically imaged. Radiographs were analyzed for fusion and instrumentation failures. Functional spinal units were harvested for histologic processing and evaluation.\nRadiographic fusion was noted in three of the 12 levels with no evidence of device failure at any of the levels. However, at necropsy, it was observed that six of the 12 specimens had either a broken screw or a cracked plate. These gross observations were confirmed within the histologic sections. Fusion was verified histologically at C2-C3 in three of the six sheep; none of the fusions were successful at C4-C5. Histologic analysis also found that the tissue surrounding the plate and disc spacer consisted of vascularized fibrous tissue with islands of active woven bone. Inflammatory cells were rarely observed.\nAlthough the bioresorbable plates and screws did not elicit an iatrogenic tissue response, a high percentage of them failed mechanically. This phenomenon was difficult to observe radiographically, as the radiolucent markers were not able to convey these instrumentation failures. Additionally, there was only a 25% fusion rate. These findings suggest that resorbable implant materials with the current biomechanical and chemical properties are inadequate for cervical fusion.

The research hypothesis was that the graft length and intact ipsilateral fibula influenced hypertrophy and stress fracture. We retrospectively studied the graft hypertrophy in 15 patients, in whom vascularized fibular graft was done for post-traumatic tibial defects with infection.\n15 male patients with mean age 33.7 years (range 18 - 56 years) of post traumatic tibial bone loss were analysed. The mean bony defect was 14.5 cm (range 6.5 - 20 cm). The mean length of the graft was 16.7 cm (range 11.5 - 21 cm). The osteoseptocutaneous flap (bone flap with attached overlying skin flap) from the contralateral side was used in all patients except one. The graft was fixed to the recipient bone at both ends by one or two AO cortical screws, supplemented by a monolateral external fixator. A standard postoperative protocol was followed in all patients. The hypertrophy percentage of the vascularized fibular graft was calculated by a modification of the formula described by El-Gammal. The followup period averaged 46.5 months (range 24 - 164 months). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was worked out, to find the relationship between graft length and hypertrophy. The t-test was performed to find out if there was any significant difference in the graft length of those who had a stress fracture and those who did not and to find out whether there was any significant difference in hypertrophy with and without ipsilateral fibula union. The Chi square test was performed to identify whether there was any association between the stress fracture and the fibula union. Given the small sample size we have not used any statistical analysis to determine the relation between the percentage of the graft hypertrophy and stress fracture.\nGraft union occurred in all patients in a mean time of 3.3 months, at both ends. At a minimum followup of 24 months the mean hypertrophy noted was 63.6% (30 - 136%) in the vascularized fibular graft. Ten stress fractures occurred in seven patients. The mean duration of the occurrence of a stress fracture in the graft was 11.1 months (2.5 - 18 months) postoperatively. The highest incidence of stress fractures was when the graft hypertrophy was less than 20%. The incidence of stress fractures reduced significantly after the graft hypertrophy exceeded 20%.\nIn most cases hypertrophy of the vascularized fibular graft occurs in response to mechanical loading by protected weight bearing, and the amount of hypertrophy is variable.

Understanding this process, especially the initial stage, has been limited by the difficulties of real-time visualizing the neovascularization embedded in tumor tissues in living animal models. In the present study, we have established a xenograft model in zebrafish by implanting mammalian tumor cells into the perivitelline space of 48 hours old Tg(Flk1:EGFP) transgenic zebrafish embryos. With this model, we dynamically visualized the process of tumor neovascularization, with unprecedented high-resolution, including new sprouts from the host vessels and the origination from VEGFR2(+) individual endothelial cells. Moreover, we quantified their contributions during the formation of vascular network in tumor. Real-time observations revealed that angiogenic sprouts in tumors preferred to connect each other to form endothelial loops, and more and more endothelial loops accumulated into the irregular and chaotic vascular network. The over-expression of VEGF165 in tumor cells significantly affected the vascularization in xenografts, not only the number and size of neo-vessels but the abnormalities of tumor vascular architecture. The specific inhibitor of VEGFR2, SU5416, significantly inhibited the vascularization and the growth of melanoma xenografts, but had little affects to normal vessels in zebrafish. Thus, this zebrafish/tumor xenograft model not only provides a unique window to investigate the earliest events of tumoral neoangiogenesis, but is sensitive to be used as an experimental platform to rapidly and visually evaluate functions of angiogenic-related genes.

Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is an antagonist of BMPs that is highly expressed in lungs and kidneys and is regulated by ALK1. The objective of this study was to determine the role of MGP in the vasculature of the lungs and kidneys. We found that Mgp gene deletion in mice caused striking AVMs in lungs and kidneys, where overall small organ size contrasted with greatly increased vascularization. Mechanistically, MGP deficiency increased BMP activity in lungs. In cultured lung epithelial cells, BMP-4 induced VEGF expression through induction of ALK1, ALK2, and ALK5. The VEGF secretion induced by BMP-4 in Mgp-/- epithelial cells stimulated proliferation of ECs. However, BMP-4 inhibited proliferation of lung epithelial cells, consistent with the increase in pulmonary vasculature at the expense of lung tissue in the Mgp-null mice. Similarly, BMP signaling and VEGF expression were increased in Mgp-/- mouse kidneys. We therefore conclude that Mgp gene deletion is what we believe to be a previously unidentified cause of AVMs. Because lack of MGP also causes arterial calcification, our findings demonstrate that the same gene defect has drastically different effects on distinct vascular beds.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2011-07-19", "authors": ["YuchengYao", "MedetJumabay", "AnthonyWang", "Kristina IBostr\u00f6m"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI57567\n10.1074/jbc.M109683200\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.166124\n10.1038/386078a0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.183053\n10.1074/jbc.M704297200\n10.1038/5102\n10.1007/s00247-005-0036-7\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2009.05.001\n10.1038/ejhg.2009.35\n10.1038/81634\n10.1182/blood-2009-01-199166\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.219071\n10.1073/pnas.0802743105\n10.1177/44.10.8813084\n10.1074/jbc.M604239200\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.176958\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.165530\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2005.02.010\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00621.x\n10.1093/hmg/ddg050\n10.1183/09031936.98.11051153\n10.1002/clc.20865\n10.1093/ndt/17.2.291\n10.1016/S0022-5347(05)67159-5\n10.1097/01.ju.0000146601.49061.a4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.219071\n10.1038/nm.2252\n10.1006/excr.1997.3739\n10.1074/jbc.M406868200\n10.1161/01.ATV.14.9.1480\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.236596\n10.1161/01.RES.0000232352.90786.fa\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80132-4"}
{"title": "Long pentraxin-3 inhibits FGF8b-dependent angiogenesis and growth of steroid hormone-regulated tumors.", "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-8b (FGF8b) exerts nonredundant autocrine/paracrine functions in steroid hormone-regulated tumors. Previous observations had shown that the soluble pattern recognition receptor long pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a natural selective antagonist for a restricted number of FGF family members, inhibiting FGF2 but not FGF1 and FGF4 activity. Here, we assessed the capacity of PTX3 to antagonize FGF8b and to inhibit the vascularization and growth of steroid hormone-regulated tumors. Surface plasmon resonance analysis shows that PTX3 binds FGF8b with high affinity (K(d) = 30-90 nmol/L). As a consequence, PTX3 prevents the binding of FGF8b to its receptors, inhibits FGF8b-driven ERK1/2 activation, cell proliferation, and chemotaxis in endothelial cells, and suppresses FGF8b-induced neovascularization in vivo. Also, PTX3 inhibits dihydrotestosterone (DHT)- and FGF8b-driven proliferation of androgen-regulated Shionogi 115 (S115) mouse breast tumor cells.

{"title": "The knee meniscus: structure-function, pathophysiology, current repair techniques, and prospects for regeneration.", "abstract": "Extensive scientific investigations in recent decades have established the anatomical, biomechanical, and functional importance that the meniscus holds within the knee joint. As a vital part of the joint, it acts to prevent the deterioration and degeneration of articular cartilage, and the onset and development of osteoarthritis. For this reason, research into meniscus repair has been the recipient of particular interest from the orthopedic and bioengineering communities. Current repair techniques are only effective in treating lesions located in the peripheral vascularized region of the meniscus. Healing lesions found in the inner avascular region, which functions under a highly demanding mechanical environment, is considered to be a significant challenge. An adequate treatment approach has yet to be established, though many attempts have been undertaken. The current primary method for treatment is partial meniscectomy, which commonly results in the progressive development of osteoarthritis. This drawback has shifted research interest toward the fields of biomaterials and bioengineering, where it is hoped that meniscal deterioration can be tackled with the help of tissue engineering. So far, different approaches and strategies have contributed to the in\u00a0vitro generation of meniscus constructs, which are capable of restoring meniscal lesions to some extent, both functionally as well as anatomically. The selection of the appropriate cell source (autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic cells, or stem cells) is undoubtedly regarded as key to successful meniscal tissue engineering. Furthermore, a large variation of scaffolds for tissue engineering have been proposed and produced in experimental and clinical studies, although a few problems with these (e.g., byproducts of degradation, stress shielding) have shifted research interest toward new strategies (e.g., scaffoldless approaches, self-assembly). A large number of different chemical (e.g., TGF-\u03b21, C-ABC) and mechanical stimuli (e.g., direct compression, hydrostatic pressure) have also been investigated, both in terms of encouraging functional tissue formation, as well as in differentiating stem cells. Even though the problems accompanying meniscus tissue engineering research are considerable, we are undoubtedly in the dawn of a new era, whereby recent advances in biology, engineering, and medicine are leading to the successful treatment of meniscal lesions.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-07-19", "authors": ["Eleftherios AMakris", "PashaHadidi", "Kyriacos AAthanasiou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.037"}

Microvascular proliferative disease in patients with diabetes results in renal damage and visual loss. We assessed the hypothesis that vascularization in carotid atherosclerotic tissue is increased in diabetic patients, especially in the critical shoulder regions of the plaque.\nCarotid endarterectomy specimens, clinical data, and blood samples were collected from patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (median 85 days after clinical event) and pharmacologic treatment for diabetes (n = 26) or no diabetes (n = 85). Plaques were fixed in formalin and transverse tissue sections prepared. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed for detection of endothelial cells (anti-CD34), macrophages (anti-CD68), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its receptor (VEGFR-2). Neovascularization was assessed as CD34(+) neovessel density in the entire section area and by the presence or absence of CD34(+) vessels in the shoulder and cap regions of the plaques.\nThe patient groups did not differ significantly in neovascularization in the entire transverse sections (2.0 vs 2.1 vessels/mm(2); P = .61) or in the fibrous cap (52% of the patients in both groups; P = .95). Neovascularization of the plaque shoulder regions was observed in 52% of the diabetic patients and in 26% of the nondiabetic patients (P = .028). VEGF-stained areas were similar in the two patient groups (0.4% and 0.2% of shoulder area; P = .61).

{"title": "A role for vascular deficiency in retinal pathology in a mouse model of ataxia-telangiectasia.", "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia is a multifaceted syndrome caused by null mutations in the ATM gene, which encodes the protein kinase ATM, a key participant in the DNA damage response. Retinal neurons are highly susceptible to DNA damage because they are terminally differentiated and have the highest metabolic activity in the central nervous system. In this study, we characterized the retina in young and aged Atm-deficient mice (Atm(-/-)). At 2 months of age, angiography revealed faint retinal vasculature in Atm(-/-) animals relative to wild-type controls. This finding was accompanied by increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor protein and mRNA. Fibrinogen, generally absent from wild-type retinal tissue, was evident in Atm(-/-) retinas, whereas mRNA of the tight junction protein occludin was significantly decreased. Immunohistochemistry labeling for occludin in 6-month-old mice showed that this decrease persists in advanced stages of the disease. Concurrently, we noticed vascular leakage in Atm(-/-) retinas. Labeling for glial fibrillary acidic protein demonstrated morphological alterations in glial cells in Atm(-/-) retinas. Electroretinographic examination revealed amplitude aberrations in 2-month-old Atm(-/-) mice, which progressed to significant functional deficits in the older mice.

{"title": "Near-infrared light modulated photothermal effect increases vascular perfusion and enhances polymeric drug delivery.", "abstract": "Hyperthermia, which is heating of tumors above 43\u00b0C for about 30min, has been known to modulate vascular permeability for enhanced chemotherapy. However, it is not clear whether a similar effect exists when temperature at tumor sites is elevated above 43\u00b0C, such as temperature achieved in laser-induced photothermal ablation (PTA) therapy. Also, the effect of timing of chemotherapeutic drug administration following heating in the efficiency of drug delivery is not established. In this study, we investigated the impact of near infrared (NIR) laser irradiated anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody C225-conjugated hollow gold nanospheres (C225-HAuNS) on vascular permeability and subsequent tumor uptake of a water-soluble polymer using combined MRI, ultrasound and optical imaging approaches. Magnetic temperature imaging showed a maximum temperature of 65.2\u00b10.10 \u00b0C in A431 tumor xenograft of mice treated with C225-HAuNS plus laser and 47.0\u00b10.33 \u00b0C in tumors of mice treated with saline plus laser at 4 W/cm\u00b2 for 3 min (control) at 2 mm from the light incident surface. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI demonstrated greater than 2-fold increase of DTPA-Gd in the initial area under the curve (IAUC\u2089\u2080) in mice injected with C225-HAuNS and exposed to NIR laser compared with control mice at 3 min after laser treatment. Similarly, Power Doppler (PD) ultrasound revealed a 4- to 6-fold increase in percentage vascularization in mice treated with C225-HAuNS plus NIR laser compared to control mice and confirmed increased vascular perfusion immediately after laser treatment. Twenty-four hours later, the blood perfusion was shut down. On optical imaging, tumor uptake of PG-Gd-NIR813, which is the model polymeric drug used, was significantly higher (p-value<0.05) in mice injected with PG-Gd-NIR813 at 5 min after laser treatment than in mice injected with PG-Gd-NIR813 at 24h after laser treatment and the saline-treated mice.

While simultaneous administration of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been previously demonstrated to boost angiogenesis, the combined long-term delivery of both growth factors from biomaterials is still a major challenge. In this work, two important heparin binding cytokines were delivered in parallel from a modular starPEG (multi-armed polyethylene glycol)--heparin hydrogel system to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) grown in culture and in a chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. As the utilized gels contain high quantities of heparin, loading and subsequent release of both growth factors (as determined by radiolabeling studies and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [ELISA]) occurred independently from each other. The combined delivery of FGF-2 and VEGF through starPEG-heparin hydrogels resulted in pro-angiogenic effects in vitro (study of cell survival/proliferation, morphology and migration) and in vivo (quantification of CAM vascularization) being clearly superior over those of the administration of single factors.

This process is mediated by the coordinated response of vascular endothelial and mural cells to the heterogeneous angiogenic cues provided by tissues and organs, whereas aberrant regulation and coordination of angiogenic signals during development result in lethality, impaired organ development, or disease states.

Endothelialized skin equivalents comprising human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) survive significantly longer due to inosculation with the capillaries of the host, but these cells are allogeneic by definition. The aim of this study was to reconstruct an autologous endothelialized skin equivalent by incorporating progenitor or pre-differentiated endothelial cells derived from adipose tissue, easily accessible source for autologous transplantation. Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells were isolated from lipoaspirates and amplified to obtain endothelial progenitor cells, which were subsequently differentiated into endothelial cells. These cells were then seeded along with human fibroblasts into a porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan-chitosan scaffold to obtain an endothelialized dermal equivalent. Then, human keratinocytes give rise to a endothelialized skin equivalent. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate the presence of capillary-like tubular structures in skin equivalents comprising pre-differentiated endothelial cells, but not endothelial progenitor cells. The former expressed both EN4 and von Willebrand factor, and Weibel-Palade bodies were detected in their cytoplasm.

{"title": "Neurovascular development in the embryonic zebrafish hindbrain.", "abstract": "The brain is made of billions of highly metabolically active neurons whose activities provide the seat for cognitive, affective, sensory and motor functions. The cerebral vasculature meets the brain's unusually high demand for oxygen and glucose by providing it with the largest blood supply of any organ. Accordingly, disorders of the cerebral vasculature, such as congenital vascular malformations, stroke and tumors, compromise neuronal function and survival and often have crippling or fatal consequences. Yet, the assembly of the cerebral vasculature is a process that remains poorly understood. Here we exploit the physical and optical accessibility of the zebrafish embryo to characterize cerebral vascular development within the embryonic hindbrain. We find that this process is primarily driven by endothelial cell migration and follows a two-step sequence. First, perineural vessels with stereotypical anatomies are formed along the ventro-lateral surface of the neuroectoderm. Second, angiogenic sprouts derived from a subset of perineural vessels migrate into the hindbrain to form the intraneural vasculature. We find that these angiogenic sprouts reproducibly penetrate into the hindbrain via the rhombomere centers, where differentiated neurons reside, and that specific rhombomeres are invariably vascularized first. While the anatomy of intraneural vessels is variable from animal to animal, some aspects of the connectivity of perineural and intraneural vessels occur reproducibly within particular hindbrain locales. Using a chemical inhibitor of VEGF signaling we determine stage-specific requirements for this pathway in the formation of the hindbrain vasculature. Finally, we show that a subset of hindbrain vessels is aligned and/or in very close proximity to stereotypical neuron clusters and axon tracts. Using endothelium-deficient cloche mutants we show that the endothelium is dispensable for the organization and maintenance of these stereotypical neuron clusters and axon tracts in the early hindbrain. However, the cerebellum's upper rhombic lip and the optic tectum are abnormal in clo. Overall, this study provides a detailed, multi-stage characterization of early zebrafish hindbrain neurovascular development with cellular resolution up to the third day of age.

{"title": "Terminal differentiation is not a major determinant for the success of stem cell therapy - cross-talk between muscle-derived stem cells and host cells.", "abstract": "We have found that when muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) are implanted into a variety of tissues only a small fraction of the donor cells can be found within the regenerated tissues and the vast majority of cells are host derived. This observation has also been documented by other investigators using a variety of different stem cell types. It is speculated that the transplanted stem cells release factors that modulate repair indirectly by mobilizing the host's cells and attracting them to the injury site in a paracrine manner. This process is loosely called a 'paracrine mechanism', but its effects are not necessarily restricted to the injury site. In support of this speculation, it has been reported that increasing angiogenesis leads to an improvement of cardiac function, while inhibiting angiogenesis reduces the regeneration capacity of the stem cells in the injured vascularized tissues. This observation supports the finding that most of the cells that contribute to the repair process are indeed chemo-attracted to the injury site, potentially through host neo-angiogenesis. Since it has recently been observed that cells residing within the walls of blood vessels (endothelial cells and pericytes) appear to represent an origin for post-natal stem cells, it is tempting to hypothesize that the promotion of tissue repair, via neo-angiogenesis, involves these blood vessel-derived stem cells. For non-vascularized tissues, such as articular cartilage, the regenerative property of the injected stem cells still promotes a paracrine, or bystander, effect, which involves the resident cells found within the injured microenvironment, albeit not through the promotion of angiogenesis. In this paper, we review the current knowledge of post-natal stem cell therapy and demonstrate the influence that implanted stem cells have on the tissue regeneration and repair process. We argue that the terminal differentiation capacity of implanted stem cells is not the major determinant of the cells regenerative potential and that the paracrine effect imparted by the transplanted cells plays a greater role in the regeneration process.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2011-07-13", "authors": ["BurhanGharaibeh", "MitraLavasani", "James HCummins", "JohnnyHuard"], "doi": "10.1186/scrt72\n10.1038/nprot.2008.142\n10.1083/jcb.200108150\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.09.008\n10.1053/j.oto.2009.10.013\n10.1038/ncpcardio0073\n10.1038/nbt1117\n10.1177/1074248410376382\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1391\n10.1016/S0003-4975(96)00389-X\n10.1016/S0963-6897(98)00011-6\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0882\n10.1016/S0022-5223(95)70067-6\n10.1016/S0003-4975(99)01148-0\n10.1016/S0022-5223(00)70193-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001789\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.61.1.219\n10.1038/nm0898-929\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2008.09.015\n10.1172/JCI118769\n10.1063/1.1481962\n10.1089/ars.2009.2455\n10.1067/mtc.2001.116317\n10.1038/nm0405-367\n10.1038/sj.gt.3301722\n10.1038/35070587\n10.1073/pnas.181177898\n10.1038/86498\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1038/7434\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2003.09.028\n10.1073/pnas.2132126100\n10.1038/nature06969\n10.1038/nature07060\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.4065/84.10.876\n10.1016/j.addr.2010.03.001\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.041\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.547810\n10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03617-5\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1507\n10.1097/00001573-200403000-00016\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199607)19:7<853::AID-MUS7>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.1083/jcb.144.6.1113\n10.1089/hum.1994.5.8-949\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.07.686\n10.1016/S1050-1738(01)00161-X\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302521\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.04.100\n10.1038/mt.2009.136\n10.1196/annals.1349.006\n10.1038/nbt1334\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.003\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.07.064\n10.1186/1479-5876-6-30\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000124062.31102.57\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001886\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.02.072\n10.1038/nature02460\n10.1152/ajpheart.01082.2008\n10.1161/01.RES.0000265848.55035.5d\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.503433\n10.1038/ki.2008.304\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.002\n10.1016/j.bone.2008.05.001\n10.1002/jcp.21309\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.060064\n10.1091/mbc.E08-03-0274\n10.1038/mt.2010.160\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.07.071\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0771\n10.1002/dvdy.1212\n10.1038/9467\n10.1053/joca.2001.0505\n10.1097/BOR.0b013e3283103d12\n10.1002/path.1527\n10.1002/1529-0131(200105)44:5<1082::AID-ANR188>3.0.CO;2-X\n10.1136/ard.60.11.1070\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63808-4\n10.1056/NEJM199410063311401\n10.1302/0301-620X.84B4.11947\n10.1302/0301-620X.85B2.13543\n10.1001/jama.281.10.876\n10.3727/000000004783983747\n10.1016/j.joca.2006.08.008\n10.1002/art.21632\n10.1002/1529-0131(199809)41:9<1632::AID-ART14>3.0.CO;2-A\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63109-4\n10.1007/s00418-005-0773-6\n10.1182/blood-2006-04-016030\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302104\n10.1002/art.24443\n10.1002/art.24153\n10.1002/jor.1100150616\n10.1002/jor.20874\n10.1359/JBMR.040102\n10.1002/jgm.588\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2004.02.023\n10.1007/s00223-009-9288-9\n10.1038/nature03260\n10.1083/jcb.200612094\n10.1359/jbmr.070702\n10.1016/j.ejheart.2008.08.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.03.083\n10.1161/01.STR.0000141893.33677.5d\n10.1152/ajprenal.00339.2006\n10.2174/1874325001004010204\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.096\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0716\n10.1002/art.11365\n10.1038/6529"}

{"title": "Haem oxygenase-1 dictates intrauterine fetal survival in mice via carbon monoxide.", "abstract": "Pregnancy establishment implies the existence of a highly vascularized and transient organ, the placenta, which ensures oxygen supply to the fetus via haemoproteins. Haem metabolism, including its catabolism by haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), should be of importance in maintaining the homeostasis of haemoproteins and controlling the deleterious effects associated with haem release from maternal or fetal haemoglobins, thus ensuring placental function and fetal development. We demonstrate that HO-1 expression is essential to promote placental function and fetal development, thus determining the success of pregnancy. Hmox1 deletion in mice has pathological consequences for pregnancy, namely suboptimal placentation followed by intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR) and fetal lethality. These pathological effects can be mimicked by administration of exogenous haem in wild-type mice. Fetal and maternal HO-1 is required to prevent post-implantation fetal loss through a mechanism that acts independently of maternal adaptive immunity and hormones. The protective HO-1 effects on placentation and fetal growth can be mimicked by the exogenous administration of carbon monoxide (CO), a product of haem catabolism by HO-1 that restores placentation and fetal growth. In a clinical relevant model of IUGR, CO reduces the levels of free haem in circulation and prevents fetal death. We unravel a novel physiological role for HO-1/CO in sustaining pregnancy which aids in understanding the biology of pregnancy and reveals a promising therapeutic application in the treatment of pregnancy pathologies.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2011-07-12", "authors": ["Maria LauraZenclussen", "Pablo ArielCasalis", "TarekEl-Mousleh", "SofiaRebelo", "StefanieLangwisch", "NadjaLinzke", "Hans-DieterVolk", "StefanFest", "Miguel ParreiraSoares", "Ana ClaudiaZenclussen"], "doi": "10.1002/path.2946"}

{"title": "Frizzled 4 is required for retinal angiogenesis and maintenance of the blood-retina barrier.", "abstract": "PURPOSE. Mice deficient in the secreted protein Norrin or its receptor Frizzled-4 (FZD4) exhibit incomplete vascularization of the neural retina. However, because of early retinal vascular defects in the knockout models, it has not been possible to study FZD4 contribution in ocular neovascular disease. To further understand the role of this signaling pathway in physiological and pathologic angiogenesis, the authors generated a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes FZD4 function in vivo. METHODS. Antibodies were generated by immunizing Fzd4 knockout mice with the cysteine-rich domain of FZD4. A monoclonal antibody (1.99.25) was discovered that antagonizes Norrin- and WNT3A-induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation in vitro. 1.99.25 and an isotype-matched negative control antibody were evaluated in models of developmental retinal angiogenesis, oxygen-induced retinopathy, and retinal angiomatous proliferation. The authors also investigated the role of FZD4 in maintaining the blood-retina barrier in normal adult mice. RESULTS. Administration of 1.99.25 inhibited physiological and pathologic sprouting angiogenesis within the retina. Inhibition of FZD4 in developing retinal vascular networks caused the upregulation of PLVAP, a protein normally associated with fenestrated, immature endothelium in the CNS. In the adult neural retina, the administration of 1.99.25 induced PLVAP expression in the deep capillary bed and enabled extravasation of small and large molecules through the blood-retina barrier. CONCLUSIONS. These results demonstrate that FZD4 is required for physiological and pathologic angiogenesis in the retina and for regulation of retinal endothelial cell differentiation.

{"title": "Normalization of the vasculature for treatment of cancer and other diseases.", "abstract": "New vessel formation (angiogenesis) is an essential physiological process for embryologic development, normal growth, and tissue repair. Angiogenesis is tightly regulated at the molecular level. Dysregulation of angiogenesis occurs in various pathologies and is one of the hallmarks of cancer. The imbalance of pro- and anti-angiogenic signaling within tumors creates an abnormal vascular network that is characterized by dilated, tortuous, and hyperpermeable vessels. The physiological consequences of these vascular abnormalities include temporal and spatial heterogeneity in tumor blood flow and oxygenation and increased tumor interstitial fluid pressure. These abnormalities and the resultant microenvironment fuel tumor progression, and also lead to a reduction in the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. With the discovery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a major driver of tumor angiogenesis, efforts have focused on novel therapeutics aimed at inhibiting VEGF activity, with the goal of regressing tumors by starvation. Unfortunately, clinical trials of anti-VEGF monotherapy in patients with solid tumors have been largely negative. Intriguingly, the combination of anti-VEGF therapy with conventional chemotherapy has improved survival in cancer patients compared with chemotherapy alone. These seemingly paradoxical results could be explained by a \"normalization\" of the tumor vasculature by anti-VEGF therapy. Preclinical studies have shown that anti-VEGF therapy changes tumor vasculature towards a more \"mature\" or \"normal\" phenotype. This \"vascular normalization\" is characterized by attenuation of hyperpermeability, increased vascular pericyte coverage, a more normal basement membrane, and a resultant reduction in tumor hypoxia and interstitial fluid pressure. These in turn can lead to an improvement in the metabolic profile of the tumor microenvironment, the delivery and efficacy of exogenously administered therapeutics, the efficacy of radiotherapy and of effector immune cells, and a reduction in number of metastatic cells shed by tumors into circulation in mice. These findings are consistent with data from clinical trials of anti-VEGF agents in patients with various solid tumors. More recently, genetic and pharmacological approaches have begun to unravel some other key regulators of vascular normalization such as proteins that regulate tissue oxygen sensing (PHD2) and vessel maturation (PDGFR\u03b2, RGS5, Ang1/2, TGF-\u03b2).

{"title": "The role of fibrin E on the modulation of endothelial progenitors adhesion, differentiation and angiogenic growth factor production and the promotion of wound healing.", "abstract": "Severe skin loss constitutes a major unsolved clinical problem worldwide. For this reason, in the last decades there has been a major push towards the development of novel therapeutic approaches to enhance skin wound healing. Neo-vessel formation through angiogenesis is a critical step during the wound healing process. Besides the contribution of pre-existing endothelial cells (EC), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have also been implicated in wound healing acting either by differentiating into EC that incorporate the neo-vessels, or via the production of paracrine factors that improve angiogenesis. Here we tested the importance of different extracellular matrices (ECM) in regulating the angiogenic and wound healing potential of cord blood-derived EPC (CB-EPC). We compared the properties of several ECM and particularly of fibrin fragment E (FbnE) in regulating EPC adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and healing-promotion in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that CB-EPCs have increased adhesion and endothelial differentiation when plated on FbnE compared to collagens, fibronectin or fibrin. Using integrin neutralizing antibodies, we show that CB-EPC adhesion to FbnE is mediated by integrin \u03b15\u03b21. Gene expression analysis of CB-EPCs plated on different substrates revealed that CB-EPC grown on FbnE shows increased expression of paracrine factors such as VEGF-A, TGF-\u03b21, SDF-1, IL-8 and MIP-1\u03b1. Accordingly, conditioned media from CB-EPC grown on FbnE induced EC tube formation and monocyte migration in vitro. To test the wound healing effects of FbnE in vivo we used an FbnE enriched scaffold in a cutaneous wound healing mouse model. In accordance with our in vitro data, co-administration of the FbnE enriched scaffold with CB-EPC significantly accelerated wound closure and wound vascularization, compared FbnE enriched scaffold alone or to using collagen-based scaffolds. Our results show that FbnE modulates several CB-EPC properties in vivo and in vitro, and as such promotes wound healing. We suggest the use of FbnE-based scaffolds represents a promising approach to resolve wound healing complications arising from different pathologies.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-07-12", "authors": ["FranciscoCaiado", "T\u00e2niaCarvalho", "FernandaSilva", "CatarinaCastro", "NunoClode", "Julian FDye", "S\u00e9rgioDias"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.022"}

The dynamic signals obtained from DCE-imaging are modeled by pharmacokinetic compartmental models which integrate the Arterial Input Function. These models use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the exchanges between the arterial and capillary plasma and the extravascular-extracellular space. Their least squares fitting takes into account measurement noises but fails to deal with unpredictable fluctuations due to external/internal sources of variations (patients' anxiety, time-varying parameters, measurement errors in the input function, etc.). Adding Brownian components to the ODEs leads to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In DCE-imaging, SDEs are discretely observed with an additional measurement noise. We propose to estimate the parameters of these noisy SDEs by maximum likelihood, using the Kalman filter. In DCE-imaging, the contrast agent injected in vein arrives in plasma with an unknown time delay. The delay parameter induces a change-point in the drift of the SDE and ODE models, which is estimated also. Estimations based on the SDE and ODE pharmacokinetic models are compared to real DCE-MRI data. They show that the use of SDE provides robustness in the estimation results.

Therefore, VEGF and PEDF expression was determined in the ROP model and in RA-raised rat pups at P14 and P18.\nOlder age was associated with increased PEDF mRNA (p<0.001), PEDF protein (p=0.005), and VEGF protein (p=0.005), and VEGF protein (p<0.0001). Exposure to fluctuations of oxygen in the 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy model compared to RA was associated with increased PEDF mRNA (p=0.0185), PEDF protein (p<0.0001), or VEGF protein (p<0.0001). The VEGF/PEDF ratio favored angiogenic inhibition (<1.0) before but not on P14, when avascular retina persisted in the ROP model but not in RA. The VEGF/PEDF ratio favored angiogenesis (>1.0) at P14 and P 18 when intravitreous neovascularization occurred in the ROP model.\nIncreased expression levels of VEGF and PEDF are associated with older postnatal day age or with exposure to fluctuations in oxygen in the 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy model compared to RA. PEDF protein more closely associates with avascular retinal features and neovascularization than does VEGF protein or the VEGF/PEDF in the ROP model. Although PEDF has been proposed as a potential treatment in ROP, interventional studies using PEDF in an ROP model to potentially reduce intravitreous neovascularization are required to determine timing, efficacy, and dose of PEDF.", "journal": "Molecular vision", "date": "2011-07-09", "authors": ["John SHartmann", "HilaryThompson", "HaiboWang", "ShamiKanekar", "WeiHuang", "Steven JBudd", "M ElizabethHartnett"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Dual-purpose bone grafts improve healing and reduce infection.", "abstract": "To determine if a dual-purpose bone graft can regenerate bone and reduce infection in highly contaminated bone critical size defects in rats.\nBiodegradable polyurethane (PUR) scaffolds were loaded with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and vancomycin (Vanc). The release kinetics of the BMP-2 were tuned to take advantage of its mechanism of action (ie, an initial burst to recruit cells and sustained release to induce differentiation of the migrating cells). The Vanc release kinetics were designed to protect the graft from contamination until it is vascularized by having a burst for a week and remaining well over the minimum inhibitory concentration for Staphylococcus aureus for 2 months. The bone regeneration and infection reduction capability of these dual-purpose grafts (PUR+Vanc+BMP-2) were compared with collagen sponges loaded with BMP-2 (collagen+BMP-2) and PUR+BMP-2 in infected critical size rat femoral segmental defects.\nThe dual-delivery approach resulted in substantially more new bone formation and a modest improvement in infection than PUR+BMP-2 and collagen+BMP-2 treatments.\nThe PUR bone graft is injectable, provides a more sustained release of BMP-2 than the collagen sponge, and can release antibiotics for more than 8 weeks. Thus, the dual-delivery approach may improve patient outcomes of open fractures by protecting the osteoinductive graft from colonization until vascularization occurs. In addition, the more optimal release kinetics of BMP-2 may reduce nonunions and the amount of growth factor required.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic trauma", "date": "2011-07-09", "authors": ["Scott AGuelcher", "Kate VBrown", "BingLi", "TejaGuda", "Baek-HeeLee", "Joseph CWenke"], "doi": "10.1097/BOT.0b013e31821f624c"}

Quantitative analysis showed that nonstabilized fractures had higher length density and surface density than stabilized fractures at 3 days after injury, suggesting that nonstabilized fractures were more vascularized. Oximetry analysis did not detect a significant difference in oxygen tension at the fracture site between stabilized and nonstabilized fractures during the first 3 days after injury. Further microarray analysis was performed to determine the effects of mechanical stability on the expression of angiogenic factors.

Recent development of computer resource has enabled 3D haemodynamic computations in wide-spread arterial network but there are still difficulties in modelling vascular geometry because of noise and limited resolution in medical images. In this paper, an integrated framework to model an arterial network tree for patient-specific computational haemodynamic study is developed. With this framework, 3D vascular geometry reconstruction of an arterial network and quantification of its geometric feature are aimed. The combination of 3D haemodynamic computation and vascular morphology quantification helps better understand the relationship between vascular morphology and haemodynamic force behind 'geometric risk factor' for cardiovascular diseases. The proposed method is applied to an intracranial arterial network to demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness. The results are compared with the marching-cubes (MC) method. The comparison shows that the present modelling method can reconstruct a wide-ranged vascular network anatomically more accurate than the MC method, particularly in peripheral circulation where the image resolution is low in comparison to the vessel diameter, because of the recognition of an arterial network connectivity based on its centreline.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2011-07-09", "authors": ["RyoTorii", "MarieOshima"], "doi": "10.1080/10255842.2011.554407"}

{"title": "[Tumor blood vessels].", "abstract": "Growth of tumors usually depends on the development of the tumor\u2019s own vasculature. Small avascular tumors (1\u20132 mm3) cannot continue growth provided an equilibrium between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is maintained within the tumor environment. Angiogenesis is not the only factor responsible for tumor blood vessels forming, as vasculogenic mimicry plays an equally substantial role in this process. Vessel-like structures formed during this process are made up from cancer cells, macrophages and mast cells. Certain neoplasms are capable of growing without developing their own vasculature; instead they secure growth via normal blood vessels of the host. Slowed-down blood flow through an abnormally built tumor vascular network is the main reason for cancer cells\u2019 underoxygenation (hypoxia). Defective blood vessels, with hypoxia resulting, play a major role in tumor progression. Underoxygenation induces formation of novel vessels and these new defective vessels are in turn the principal reason for hypoxia. The latter increases cancer cells\u2019 malignancy and invasiveness. A particular process, called transdifferentiation, takes place in tumor vasculature when hypoxia is present and involves neoplastic cells transforming into endothelial cells. Since growth of a tumor is dependent on its own blood supply, inhibition of such vascular network growth and/or damage to this network should exert a strong impact on tumor growth. Long-term administration of anti-angiogenic drugs, however, encounters unexpected problems. Anti-angiogenic drug resistance, together with paradoxical stimulation of invasiveness and metastasis by these drugs, has lately become a dominant issue in anticancer therapy.", "journal": "Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online)", "date": "2011-07-08", "authors": ["Stanis\u0142awSzala", "MagdalenaJarosz"], "doi": "10.5604/17322693.951193"}
{"title": "Dual function of ERR\u03b1 in breast cancer and bone metastasis formation: implication of VEGF and osteoprotegerin.", "abstract": "Bone metastasis is a complication occurring in up to 70% of advanced breast cancer patients. The estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERR\u03b1) has been implicated in breast cancer and bone development, prompting us to examine whether ERR\u03b1 may function in promoting the osteolytic growth of breast cancer cells in bone. In a mouse xenograft model of metastatic human breast cancer, overexpression of wild-type ERR\u03b1 reduced metastasis, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative mutant promoted metastasis. Osteoclasts were directly affected and ERR\u03b1 upregulated the osteoclastogenesis inhibitor, osteoprotegerin (OPG), providing a direct mechanistic basis for understanding how ERR\u03b1 reduced breast cancer cell growth in bone. In contrast, ERR\u03b1 overexpression increased breast cancer cell growth in the mammary gland. ERR\u03b1-overexpressing primary tumors were highly vascularized, consistent with an observed upregulation of angiogenic growth factor, the VEGF. In support of these findings, we documented that elevated expression of ERR\u03b1 mRNA in breast carcinomas was associated with high expression of OPG and VEGF and with disease progression. In conclusion, our results show that ERR\u03b1 plays a dual role in breast cancer progression in promoting the local growth of tumor cells, but decreasing metastatic growth of osteolytic lesions in bone.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2011-07-08", "authors": ["Ana\u00efsFradet", "Hel\u00e8neSorel", "LamiaBouazza", "DelphineGoehrig", "BaptisteD\u00e9palle", "AkeilaBellahc\u00e8ne", "VincentCastronovo", "H\u00e9l\u00e8neFollet", "Fran\u00e7oiseDescotes", "Jane EAubin", "PhilippeCl\u00e9zardin", "EdithBonnelye"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1431"}

Here, we use high-resolution intravital imaging to evaluate nanoparticle uptake in human tumor xenografts in a modified, shell-less chicken embryo model. The chicken embryo model is particularly well-suited for these in vivo analyses because it supports the growth of human tumors, is relatively inexpensive and does not require anesthetization or surgery 4,5. Tumor cells form fully vascularized xenografts within 7 days when implanted into the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)( 6). The resulting tumors are visualized by non-invasive real-time, high-resolution imaging that can be maintained for up to 72 hours with little impact on either the host or tumor systems. Nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and formulations administered distal to the tumor can be visualized and quantified as they flow through the bloodstream, extravasate from leaky tumor vasculature, and accumulate at the tumor site. We describe here the analysis of nanoparticles derived from Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) decorated with near-infrared fluorescent dyes and/or polyethylene glycol polymers (PEG) (7, 8, 9,10,11). Upon intravenous administration, these viral nanoparticles are rapidly internalized by endothelial cells, resulting in global labeling of the vasculature both outside and within the tumor(7,12). PEGylation of the viral nanoparticles increases their plasma half-life, extends their time in the circulation, and ultimately enhances their accumulation in tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (7, 10,11).

On days 5, 7, 12, 14, 17 and 19 post-AI, each animal underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography of the corpus luteum and blood samples were collected for cell counts and plasma progesterone determination. Through general linear model repeated measures analysis of variance, significant effects were observed of treatment, parity, inseminating bull, reduced vascularization of the CL and pregnancy on plasma progesterone concentrations, whereas mean plasma progesterone and time luteal phase day, and treatment and plasma progesterone concentration on day 5 post-AI were found to, respectively, affect neutrophil and lymphocyte counts throughout the luteal phase.

{"title": "Loss of transcription factor early growth response gene 1 results in impaired endochondral bone repair.", "abstract": "Transcription factors that play a role in ossification during development are expected to participate in postnatal fracture repair since the endochondral bone formation that occurs in embryos is recapitulated during fracture repair. However, inherent differences exist between bone development and fracture repair, including a sudden disruption of tissue integrity followed by an inflammatory response. This raises the possibility that repair-specific transcription factors participate in bone healing. Here, we assessed the consequence of loss of early growth response gene 1 (EGR-1) on endochondral bone healing because this transcription factor has been shown to modulate repair in vascularized tissues. Model fractures were created in ribs of wild type (wt) and EGR-1(-/-) mice. Differences in tissue morphology and composition between these two animal groups were followed over 28 post fracture days (PFDs). In wt mice, bone healing occurred in healing phases characteristic of endochondral bone repair. A similar healing sequence was observed in EGR-1(-/-) mice but was impaired by alterations. A persistent accumulation of fibrin between the disconnected bones was observed on PFD7 and remained pronounced in the callus on PFD14. Additionally, the PFD14 callus was abnormally enlarged and showed increased deposition of mineralized tissue. Cartilage ossification in the callus was associated with hyper-vascularity and -proliferation. Moreover, cell deposits located in proximity to the callus within skeletal muscle were detected on PFD14. Despite these impairments, repair in EGR-1(-/-) callus advanced on PFD28, suggesting EGR-1 is not essential for healing.

{"title": "Preferred use of the ipsilateral pedicled TRAM flap for immediate breast reconstruction: an illustrated approach.", "abstract": "Recent experience with the ipsilateral TRAM flap has shown that it has the advantage of a longer functional pedicle length, which allows tension-free inset of well-vascularized tissue into the breast pocket. This leads to better positioning and shaping of the reconstructed breast with minimal disruption of the inframammary fold. The purpose of this article was to provide an illustrated approach to the ipsilateral TRAM flap and to clarify the technique when applied in the context of immediate breast reconstruction following cancer extirpation.\nA prospective evaluation of 89 patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction following skin-sparing mastectomy for breast cancer was performed. All patients underwent ipsilateral TRAM reconstruction. The innate insetting advantage of the ipsilateral TRAM flap is illustrated in the article. The key steps of the technique were as follows: (1) The ipsilateral corner of the flap was used as the axillary tail, leaving the more bulky part to form the main body of the breast; (2) To avoid undesirable twists, a right TRAM was rotated clockwise so that its apex points superiorly; (3) This flap was subsequently tunneled into the breast pocket while preserving the inframammary fold. The opposite maneuvers were done for the left side; (4) If the flap was congested, venous augmentation was performed where the tributary of the axillary vein or the thoracodorsal vein was anastomosed with the inferior epigastric vein from the flap with an interposed vein graft (17% of cases).\nAll flaps survived and flap-related complications included partial necrosis of tissue across the midline (2.2%), palpable fat necrosis (22%), and hematoma requiring drainage (2.2%). All flaps were raised concurrent with the resection, and the combined operative time ranged from 3.5 to 6\u00a0h, with a mean hospital stay of 7\u00a0days.\nThe ipsilateral TRAM flap was a reliable flap with low complication rates and short surgery time.

{"title": "Semaphorin 3E-Plexin-D1 signaling regulates VEGF function in developmental angiogenesis via a feedback mechanism.", "abstract": "Blood vessel networks are typically formed by angiogenesis, a process in which new vessels form by sprouting of endothelial cells from pre-existing vessels. This process is initiated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated tip cell selection and subsequent angiogenic sprouting. Surprisingly, we found that VEGF directly controls the expression of Plexin-D1, the receptor for the traditional repulsive axon guidance cue, semaphorin 3E (Sema3E). Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling then negatively regulates the activity of the VEGF-induced Delta-like 4 (Dll4)-Notch signaling pathway, which controls the cell fate decision between tip and stalk cells. Using the mouse retina as a model system, we show that Plexin-D1 is selectively expressed in endothelial cells at the front of actively sprouting blood vessels and its expression is tightly controlled by VEGF secreted by surrounding tissues. Therefore, although the Sema3E secreted by retinal neurons is evenly distributed throughout the retina, Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling is spatially controlled by VEGF through its regulation of Plexin-D1. Moreover, we show that gain and loss of function of Sema3E and Plexin-D1 disrupts normal Dll4 expression, Notch activity, and tip/stalk cell distribution in the retinal vasculature. Finally, the retinal vasculature of mice lacking sema3E or plexin-D1 has an uneven growing front, a less-branched vascular network, and abnormal distribution of dll4-positive cells. Lowering Notch activity in the mutant mice can reverse this defect, solidifying the observation that Dll4-Notch signaling is regulated by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 and is required for its function in vivo. Together, these data reveal a novel role of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 function in modulating angiogenesis via a VEGF-induced feedback mechanism.", "journal": "Genes & development", "date": "2011-07-05", "authors": ["JihaKim", "Won-JongOh", "NicholasGaiano", "YutakaYoshida", "ChenghuaGu"], "doi": "10.1101/gad.2042011"}

Treatment of avascular necrosis of the humeral head is dependent upon the stage of disease as well as the dimension and location of necrosis. In general, the outcome is poor and complete restoration of the shoulder function is rarely attained. Contrary to osteonecrosis of carpal bones (where vascularized bone grafts have been routinely carried out for decades), reports of analogous procedures at the humeral head are anecdotal.\nBased on selective post-mortem computer-tomographic angiography of 5 and the dissection of 30 embalmed human cadaver shoulders, we describe the anatomy of the acromial branch of the thoracoacromial trunk. The main focus was the constancy of its anatomical course, its dimensions and potential use as a nutrient vessel for a pedicled bone graft from the acromion.\nThe course of the acromial branch revealed a constant topographic relationship to anatomical landmarks. Its terminal branches reliably supplied the anterior part of the acromion. The vascularized bone graft could be sufficiently mobilized to allow tension-free transfer to the humeral head as well as to the lateral two-thirds of the clavicle.\nWe demonstrated the feasibility of vascularized bone graft harvesting from the acromion.

A 23-year-old woman with history of recurrent respiratory infections and three episodes of hemoptysis was admitted at the hospital. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration. The angiographic study showed the presence of three inflow arteries arising from the thoracic aorta (T10) and supplying the abnormal lung parenchyma at the base of the left hemithorax. The patient underwent endovascular treatment consisting of exclusion of the inflow vessels with Amplatzer occlusive devices and coils. Subsequent computed tomography angiogram confirmed complete infarction of the sequestration. At 7 months, the patient presented with a new episode of bronchial infection. Repeated angiography showed persistence of intermediate small nutrient branches that were treated with coil embolization. The patient is symptom-free at 41 months after this secondary procedure.

{"title": "Double-barrel fibula vascularized free flap with dental rehabilitation for mandibular reconstruction.", "abstract": "The vascularized free fibula flap has become the most popular reconstruction method after mandibular resection because of adequate bone graft length and acceptance of dental implants. However, using 1 fibula bone may produce a height discrepancy between the native mandible and the grafted fibula that results in subsequent difficulty in wearing conventional dentures or osteointegrated implants. Several options can be used to resolve this problem such as delayed onlay bone graft, iliac bone reconstruction, fibula distraction, and double-barrel fibula flap graft. This article describes the reconstruction of segmental mandible defects with the double-barrel fibula flap and denture rehabilitation.\nThis procedure was used in 7 patients. A donor site fibula corresponding to at least twice the length of the mandibular defect was harvested. Double-barrel free fibula grafting was performed in 6 patients for primary reconstruction and 1 patient for secondary reconstruction, including 3 cases of osteocutaneous flap with skin islands in the reconstruction of a composite defect from a malignant tumor. Prosthodontic treatment was completed in all 7 patients. Four patients received secondary implant-supported dental reconstruction, and 3 patients who received radiation (6,000 cGy) after graft surgery had conventional removable partial dentures.\nMicrovascular fibula transfers were completely successful, and all skin paddles survived without necrosis. The original mandibular contour was maintained by a reconstruction plate; the reconstruction mandibular length was 6.5 to 10 cm, the reconstruction height of the double-barrel fibula was 3.0 to 3.8 cm, and all patients were satisfied with the postoperative facial esthetics and chewing function from the implant-supported denture and removable partial prostheses.\nMandibular segmental defects can be esthetically and functionally reconstructed by a double-barrel vascularized fibula flap that not only matches the height of the native mandible but also allows osteointegrated dental implantation for dental rehabilitation.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2011-07-05", "authors": ["YueHe", "Zhi YuanZhang", "Han GuangZhu", "Yi QunWu", "Hong HaiFu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2011.02.051"}

Potential etiologies include disease- or treatment-related impairment of bone marrow function, or trauma to highly friable and vascularized malignant tissues. Immune impairment may also occur in solid or hematologic malignancies, leading to spontaneous formation of inhibitory antibodies against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Because hemorrhage due to acquired FVIII inhibitors will not respond to conventional treatment algorithms for bleeding, failure to promptly recognize and diagnose this condition may result in undue morbidity and mortality. The persistence of FVIII autoantibodies in the patient with cancer may further complicate necessary invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in the short term and lead to lethal bleeding in the long term.

In order to reconstruct the vertical height of the alveolar process and improve implant position as well as angulation, some therapeutic options are available, including primary use of the fibula as a double-barrel graft and vertical distraction as well as later augmentation with avascular bone grafts. We analyzed the anatomic and morphologic features in 40 fibula bones of 20 cadavers and provided the mean cortical thickness of different transplant sites. Furthermore, we investigated the primary implant stability of dental implants inserted monocortically in harvested fibula segments using established biomechanical methods as well as Periotest(\u00ae). The minimal bone height of the clinically relevant segments of the fibula transplant measured 9.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45 mm, which was assessed in the most distal part. In contrast, a maximal total bone height of 15.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78 was observed in the middle segment of the fibula bone. We assessed sufficient primary stability in all inserted implants as well as a reliable relative micro-movement of the implants in the fibula bone. Fibula graft as a single-barrel graft alone may provide through monocortical implant insertion a further refinement of the method to fit complex requirements and shorten prolonged therapeutic procedures.

The scaffolds immobilized with heparin/chitosan nanoparticles exhibited highly effective localization and sustained release of VEGF for several weeks in vitro. This modified scaffold significantly stimulated endothelial cells' proliferation in vitro.

{"title": "Combined blockade of VEGFR-3 and VLA-1 markedly promotes high-risk corneal transplant survival.", "abstract": "PURPOSE. High-risk corneal transplantation refers to grafting performed on inflamed and highly vascularized host beds. It represents a clinical dilemma because the rejection rate can be as high as 90%, irrespective of current treatment modalities. This study was conducted to investigate whether combined blockade of VEGFR-3 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3) and VLA-1 (very late antigen-1) promotes high-risk transplant survival and how it correlates with corneal lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis before and after transplantation. METHODS. High-risk corneal transplantation was performed between normal C57BL/6 (donor) and inflamed BALB/c (recipient) mice. The recipients were randomized to receive intraperitoneal injections of VEGFR-3 and VLA-1-neutralizing antibodies or their controls twice a week for up to 8 weeks after transplantation. Corneal grafts were evaluated by ophthalmic slit-lamp biomicroscopy and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Additionally, whole-mount corneas before and after transplantation were examined by immunofluorescent microscopic assays, and the correlation between lymphatic or blood vessel distribution and transplant outcome was analyzed. RESULTS. The combined blockade markedly promotes 90% survival of high-risk transplants. This strategy specifically modified host beds by selective inhibition of lymphangiogenesis but not hemangiogenesis. A strong correlation was also identified between high-risk transplant rejection and severe lymphatic invasion reaching the donor-graft border. CONCLUSIONS. These novel findings not only provide a new and potentially powerful strategy to promote high-risk transplant survival, they also confirm a critical role of high-degree lymphangiogenesis in mediating high-risk transplant rejection.

Over the last decade, the use of calcium phosphate (CaP) based bone substitute materials has increased exponentially. These bone substitute materials vary in composition, mechanical strength and biological mechanism of function, each having their own advantages and disadvantages. It is known that intrinsic material properties of CaP bone substitutes have a profound effect on their mechanical and biological behaviour and associated biodegradation. These material properties of bone substitutes, such as porosity, composition and geometry change the trade-off between mechanical and biological performance. The choice of the optimal bone substitutes is therefore not always an easy one, and largely depends on the clinical application and its associated biological and mechanical needs. Not all bone graft substitutes will perform the same way, and their performance in one clinical site may not necessarily predict their performance in another site. CaP bone substitutes unfortunately have yet to achieve optimal mechanical and biological performance and to date each material has its own trade-off between mechanical and biological performance.

Angiogenesis induced in the membranous mesenteric parts by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a pro-angiogenic factor can be modulated by subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.) or oral (p.o.) treatment with modifying agents of choice. Each membranous part of the mesentery is translucent and framed by fatty tissue, giving it a window-like appearance. The assay has the following advantageous features: (i) the test tissue is natively vascularized, albeit sparsely, and since it is extremely thin, the microvessel network is virtually two-dimensional, which allows the entire network to be assessed microscopically in situ; (ii) in adult rats the test tissue lacks significant physiologic angiogenesis, which characterizes most normal adult mammalian tissues; the degree of native vascularization is, however, correlated with age, as discussed in(1); (iii) the negligible level of trauma-induced angiogenesis ensures high sensitivity; (iv) the assay replicates the clinical situation, as the angiogenesis-modulating test drugs are administered systemically and the responses observed reflect the net effect of all the metabolic, cellular, and molecular alterations induced by the treatment; (v) the assay allows assessments of objective, quantitative, unbiased variables of microvascular spatial extension, density, and network pattern formation, as well as of capillary sprouting, thereby enabling robust statistical analyses of the dose-effect and molecular structure-activity relationships; and (vi) the assay reveals with high sensitivity the toxic or harmful effects of treatments in terms of decreased rate of physiologic body-weight gain, as adult rats grow robustly. Mast-cell-mediated angiogenesis was first demonstrated using this assay(3,4). The model demonstrates a high level of discrimination regarding dosage-effect relationships and the measured effects of systemically administered chemically or functionally closely related drugs and proteins, including: (i) low-dosage, metronomically administered standard chemotherapeutics that yield diverse, drug-specific effects (i.e., angiogenesis-suppressive, neutral or angiogenesis-stimulating activities(5)); (ii) natural iron-unsaturated human lactoferrin, which stimulates VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis(6), and natural iron-unsaturated bovine lactoferrin, which inhibits VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis(7); and (iii) low-molecular-weight heparin fractions produced by various means(8,9). Moreover, the assay is highly suited to studies of the combined effects on angiogenesis of agents that are administered systemically in a concurrent or sequential fashion.

Tumor-bearing animals were treated with (i) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, administered via the drinking water, including N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nonisoform-selective inhibitor, and 2 others that target the inducible (NOS II) enzyme preferentially, namely 1-amino-2-hydroxyguanidine or N-[3-(aminomethyl)benzyl]acetamidine hydrochloride; or (ii) daily injections (intraperitoneally) of 2 Ru(III) polyaminocarboxylates, AMD6221 and AMD6245, both of which are effective NO scavengers. L-NAME, AMD6221, and AMD6245 reduced tumor growth by approximately 60% to 75% of control rates. Tumor sections stained with abs to CD-31/platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 or NOS III showed that this was associated with a marked reduction (60%-77%) of tumor microvascular densitiy (MVD). Tumors resumed growing promptly when treatment was discontinued, accompanied by partial or complete restoration of MVDs. In contrast, NOS-II selective inhibitors had no effect on tumor growth or vascularization, indicating that both responses require complete blockade of NO production. The results corroborate the view that endogenous NO facilitates tumor development. We suggest that NO deprivation causes tumor feeder vessels to constrict, reducing tumor blood flow. The delivery of oxygen and essential nutrients to the developing tumor is impaired as a consequence, hampering further growth. Normalizing NO levels by withholding treatment causes tumor feeder vessels to dilate, increasing tumor perfusion and reestablishing conditions that allow tumors to begin growing again.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2011-06-30", "authors": ["Frederick WFlitney", "Rebecca JPritchard", "Gordon DKennovin", "Stuart KBisland", "David GHirst", "Simon PFricker"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0840"}

As angiogenesis is a host-driven process, functional heritable variation in KDR, the gene encoding VEGFR-2, may affect VEGFR-2 function and, ultimately, the extent of tumor angiogenesis.\nWe resequenced KDR using 24 DNAs each from healthy Caucasian, African American, and Asian groups. Nonsynonymous genetic variants were assessed for function by phosphorylation assays. Luciferase reporter gene assays were used to examine effects of variants on gene expression. KDR mRNA and protein expression and microvessel density (MVD) were measured in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor samples, and matching patient DNA samples were genotyped to test for associations with variants of interest.\nKDR resequencing led to the discovery of 120 genetic variants, of which 25 had not been previously reported. Q472H had increased VEGFR-2 protein phosphorylation and associated with increased MVD in NSCLC tumor samples. -2854C and -2455A increased luciferase expression and associated with higher KDR mRNA levels in NSCLC samples. -271A reduced luciferase expression and associated with lower VEGFR-2 levels in NSCLC samples. -906C and 23408G associated with higher KDR mRNA levels in NSCLC samples.\nThis study has defined KDR genetic variation in 3 populations and identified common variants that impact on tumoral KDR expression and vascularization.

{"title": "T cells enhance gold nanoparticle delivery to tumors in vivo.", "abstract": "Gold nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) has shown great potential for the treatment of cancer in mouse studies and is now being evaluated in clinical trials. For this therapy, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are injected intravenously and are allowed to accumulate within the tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The tumor is then irradiated with a near infrared laser, whose energy is absorbed by the AuNPs and translated into heat. While reliance on the EPR effect for tumor targeting has proven adequate for vascularized tumors in small animal models, the efficiency and specificity of tumor delivery in vivo, particularly in tumors with poor blood supply, has proven challenging. In this study, we examine whether human T cells can be used as cellular delivery vehicles for AuNP transport into tumors. We first demonstrate that T cells can be efficiently loaded with 45 nm gold colloid nanoparticles without affecting viability or function (e.g. migration and cytokine production). Using a human tumor xenograft mouse model, we next demonstrate that AuNP-loaded T cells retain their capacity to migrate to tumor sites in vivo. In addition, the efficiency of AuNP delivery to tumors in vivo is increased by more than four-fold compared to injection of free PEGylated AuNPs and the use of the T cell delivery system also dramatically alters the overall nanoparticle biodistribution. Thus, the use of T cell chaperones for AuNP delivery could enhance the efficacy of nanoparticle-based therapies and imaging applications by increasing AuNP tumor accumulation.", "journal": "Nanoscale research letters", "date": "2011-06-30", "authors": ["Laura CKennedy", "Adham SBear", "Joseph KYoung", "Nastassja ALewinski", "JeanKim", "Aaron EFoster", "Rebekah ADrezek"], "doi": "10.1186/1556-276X-6-283\n10.1016/j.canlet.2008.04.026\n10.1073/pnas.2232479100\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0016\n10.1016/j.canlet.2004.02.004\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2535\n10.1002/adma.200701974\n10.1021/nl070345g\n10.1021/jp9003592\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.1.1.241\n10.1021/nl900031y\n10.1002/smll.200901557\n10.1007/s10967-007-0230-1\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4242\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.06.017\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1480\n10.1021/nl072209h\n10.1038/nm1297\n10.1089/104303402760128504\n10.1038/nm1681\n10.1182/blood-2003-11-3803\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2005.12.040\n10.1002/smll.201000134\n10.1002/lsm.20577\n10.1002/lsm.20223\n10.1021/nl070610y\n10.1021/ja057254a\n10.1364/OE.16.001590\n10.2217/17435889.2.1.113\n10.1097/CJI.0b013e318177092b\n10.1038/nm.2198\n10.1002/smll.200700595\n10.1021/nl052396o\n10.1038/nnano.2008.30\n10.1084/jem.20040890\n10.1126/science.1076514\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.25.022106.141527\n10.1038/nm.1882\n10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181ee6675\n10.1182/blood-2009-03-209650\n10.1084/jem.20061890\n10.1097/00002371-200209000-00002\n10.1007/s10549-009-0527-6\n10.1034/j.1600-0528.2002.017412.x\n10.1182/blood-2006-04-017061"}

The aim of the study was the immortalization of early progenitor cells with high proliferative potential, capable to differentiate to EPCs and, further, toward endothelial cells. Two cell lines, namely HEPC-CB.1 and HEPC-CB.2 (human endothelial progenitor cells-cord blood) were isolated.

It has been estimated that the costs of its complications account for 5% to 10% of the total healthcare spending around the world. According to World Health Organization, 300 million people are expected to develop diabetes mellitus by the year 2025. The pancreatic islet transplantation is expected to be less invasive than a pancreas transplant, which is currently the most commonly used approach.\nTo compare the encapsulated and free islet transplantation in rodents looking at sites of islet implantation, number of injected islets, viability and immunosuppression.\nA literature search was conducted using MEDLINE/PUBMED and SCIELO with terms about islet transplantation in the rodent from 2000 to 2010. We found 2,636 articles but only 56 articles from 2000 to 2010 were selected.\nIn these 56 articles used, 34% were encapsulated and 66% were nonencapsulated islets. Analyzing both types of islets transplantation, the majority of the encapsulated islets were implanted into the peritoneal cavity and the nonencapsulated islets into the liver, through the portal vein. In addition, the great advantage of the peritoneal cavity as the site of islet transplantation is its blood supply. Both vascular endothelial cells and vascular endothelial growth factor were used to stimulate angiogenesis of the islet grafts, increasing the vascularization rapidly after implantation. It also has been proven that there is influence of the capsules, since the larger the capsule more chances there are of central necrosis. In some articles, the use of immunosuppression demonstrated to increase the life expectancy of the graft.\nWhile significant progress has been made in the islets transplantation field, many obstacles remain to be overcome. Microencapsulation provides a means to transplant islets without immunosuppressive agents and may enable the performance of xenotransplantation. The use of alternative donor sources, fewer islets per capsule and the appropriate deployment location, such as the peritoneal cavity, may give a future perspective to the application of immunoprotective capsules and viability in clinical practice. A variety of strategies, such as genetic engineering, co-encapsulation, improvement in oxygen supply or the establishment of hypoxia resistance will also improve the islet transplantation performance. It remains to be determined which combination of strategies with encapsulation can fulfill the promise of establishing a simple and safe transplantation as a cure for diabetes.", "journal": "Arquivos de gastroenterologia", "date": "2011-06-29", "authors": ["Yngrid Ellyn Dias Maciel deSouza", "EleazarChaib", "Patricia Gra\u00e7a de deLacerda", "AlessandraCrescenzi", "ArnaldoBernal-Filho", "Luiz Augusto CarneiroD'Albuquerque"], "doi": "10.1590/s0004-28032011000200011"}

In aggressive malignancies such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), vascularization is often excessive and facilitates tumor progression. In an attempt to maintain tumors in a state of quiescence, multiple anti-angiogenic agents have been developed. Although several angiogenesis inhibitors have produced enhanced clinical benefits in GBM, many of these pharmacologic agents result in transitory initial response phases followed by evasive tumor resistance. Thus, a significant need exists for the discovery of novel and effective anti-angiogenic therapies. The development of new molecular-targeted therapeutic strategies is often complicated by the complexity of angiogenic signal transduction. Due to the labyrinthine nature of these signaling pathways, increased production of other angiogenic factors may compensate for the inhibition of key vascular targets like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Such compensatory mechanisms facilitate vascularization and allow tumor growth to proceed even in the presence of anti-angiogenic agents.

In the present study the creation of an aligned prevascularized muscle tissue was addressed. We hypothesized that an aligned vascularized three-dimensional (3D) muscle tissue can be induced in vitro by merely using uniaxial stress. The present study showed that not only do endothelial cells and muscle cells independently align in the direction of uniaxial stress in a hydrogel-based 3D culture system, but also, more importantly, the endothelial cells in the co-cultured 3D constructs organized into vascular structures. Strikingly, in these cultures no additional growth factors were needed to induce vascular formation of the endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by the muscle cells was stimulated by the uniaxial stress that develops in the tissue when constrained in one direction.

The latissimus dorsi flap remains a viable option with which to provide autologous coverage, although for certain patients the donor scar can be a point of contention. The scarless latissimus dorsi flap is a way of mitigating these concerns. The authors present their 6-year single-surgeon experience with scarless latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.\nA retrospective review of scarless latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction was performed. Charts from 2003 to 2009 were queried for demographic characteristics, nonoperative therapies, and short- and long-term complications. Results were compared with historical data.\nThirty-one patients with 52 flaps were identified. Fifty-one flaps were immediate reconstructions, with an average age of 47 years and body mass index of 22.8 kg/m. Thirteen patients were treated with chemotherapy and four were irradiated, two preoperatively. The single drain was removed on average at 21 days. Complications included three hematomas (5.8 percent), two capsular contractures (3.8 percent), and two infections (3.8 percent). Average time to secondary reconstruction was 143 days. There were five unplanned revisions (9.6 percent). There were no flap failures or tissue expander losses.\nThe scarless latissimus dorsi flap is an effective method for providing durable homogenous device coverage in the thinner patient (body mass index <24). With the advent of acellular dermal matrices, device coverage has been made simpler, but this comes at a cost. Coverage is thin, the matrix is not initially vascularized, and products are expensive. For these reasons, use of the scarless latissimus dorsi flap is an excellent alternative, particularly in the patient with a low body mass index.\nTherapeutic, IV.(Figure is included in full-text article.).", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2011-06-28", "authors": ["L FranklynElliott", "Bahair HGhazi", "David MOtterburn"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e318218fcc6"}
{"title": "Transplantation of adipose stromal cells promotes neovascularization of random skin flaps.", "abstract": "The delivery of bone marrow-derived mononulear cells (BM-MNCs) has been proved to be effective at promoting neovascularization of ischemic skin flaps. However, the limited source of BM-MNCs restricts their clinical application. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) contains a group of heterogeneous cells in the adipose tissue, including adipose tissue-derived stem cells, and it has abundant reserve in human body. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of SVF to promote neovascularization of random skin flaps. Female Wistar rats were randomly devided into three groups with 8 in each group and received allogeneic SVF, BM-MNCs and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), respectively, before surgery. Two days after cell administration, a 10 \u00d7 3 cm random skin flap was elevated. Flap survival, blood flow perfusion and capillary density were examined 7 days after surgery, and the relevant mechanism was also explored. Results showed that SVF group and BM-MNCs group had higher survival percentage (72.2 \u00b1 2.0% and 76.4 \u00b1 3.1%, respectively) as compared with the control group (56.8 \u00b1 4.6%, P < 0.05). Blood flow perfusion and capillary density of flap tissues in SVF and BM-MNCs groups were both improved. The expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were increased in flap tissues of SVF and BM-MNCs groups detected by ELISA. These results indicate that SVF could promote vascularization and increase flap survival probably by secreting VEGF and bFGF. The effect of transplantation of SVF on therapeutic angiogenesis of skin flaps is equivalent to that of BM-MNCs.", "journal": "The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine", "date": "2011-06-28", "authors": ["LinglingSheng", "MeiYang", "HuaLi", "ZijingDu", "YiaiYang", "QingfengLi"], "doi": "10.1620/tjem.224.229"}

It is incontrovertible that coronary stents, in general, have been beneficial for the vast majority of patients. A small increase in thrombosis, following DES implantation, is offset by a diminished risk of complications associated with repeat vascularization. However, late and, especially, very late stent thrombosis is a much feared complication because it is associated with myocardial infarction with increased mortality. Despite that stent thrombosis is thought to be multifactorial, so far clinical reports and reported pathology findings in patients died from coronary stent thrombosis as well as animal studies and experiments, point toward a hypersensitivity inflammation. The stented and thrombotic areas are infiltrated by interacting, via bidirectional stimuli inflammatory cells including eosinophils, macrophages, T-cells and mast cells. Stented regions constitute an ideal surrounding for endothelial damage and dysfunction, together with hemorheologic changes and turbulence as well as platelet dysfunction, coagulation and fibrinolytic disturbances. Drug eluting stent components include the metal strut which contains nickel, chromium, manganese, titanium, molybdenum, the polymer coating and the impregnated drugs which for the first generation stents are: the antimicrotubule antineoplastic agent paclitaxel and the anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative agent sirolimus. The newer stents which are called cobalt-chromiun stents and elute the sirolimus analogs everolimus and zotarolimus both contain nickel and other metals. All these components constitute an antigenic complex inside the coronary arteries which apply chronic, continuous, repetitive and persistent inflammatory action capable to induced Kounis syndrome and stent thrombosis. Allergic inflammation goes through three phases, the early phase, the late phase and the chronic phase and these three phases correspond temporally with early (acute and sub acute), late and very late stent thrombosis. Bioabsorbable allergy free poly lactic acid self expanding stents, nickel free stainless steel materials, stent coverage with nitric oxide donors and antibodies with endothelial progenitor cell capturing abilities as well as stents eluting anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic agents might be the solution of this so feared and devastating stent complication.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2011-06-28", "authors": ["Nicholas GKounis", "SotirisGiannopoulos", "Grigorios GTsigkas", "JohnGoudevenos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.05.052"}

Twenty-four 9-month-old ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporotic rats and age-matched sham-ovariectomized (Sham) rats were used for establishing closed fracture models on right femora. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-operatively, four rats in each group underwent in vivo 3D-HF-PDU scanning for evaluation of vascularization and blood flow at the fracture site. Then the fractured femora were harvested for ex vivo microangiography, and neovasculatures within the callus were reconstructed for vascular volume analysis. Correlation between the vascular volumes of the two methodologies was examined. Both 3D-HF-PDU and microangiography showed a decline of vascular volume at the fracture site from 2 to 8 weeks and a significantly larger volume in the Sham group than the OVX group. A significant linear positive correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.87, p\u2009<\u20090.001) was detected between the volumes measured by the two methodologies.

Transplanted cells regenerated a differentiated and vascularized auto-renewing epidermis progressively repopulated by dendritic cells and melanocytes. No adverse immune reaction was detected in either dog. In dog 1, the grafted epidermis firmly adhered to the dermis throughout the 24-month follow-up, which correlated with efficient transduction (100%) of highly clonogenic epithelial cells and sustained transgene expression. In dog 2, less efficient (65%) transduction of primary keratinocytes resulted in a loss of the transplanted epidermis and graft blistering 5 months after transplantation. These data provide the proof of principle for ex vivo gene therapy of RDEB patients with missense mutations in collagen type VII by engraftment of the reconstructed epidermis, and demonstrate that highly efficient transduction of epidermal stem cells is crucial for successful gene therapy of inherited skin diseases in which correction of the genetic defect confers no major selective advantage in cell culture.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2011-06-24", "authors": ["YannickGache", "DidierPin", "LaurentGagnoux-Palacios", "ClaudeCarozzo", "GuerrinoMeneguzzi"], "doi": "10.1038/jid.2011.172"}

The human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL37 can be found at different concentrations in many different cells, tissues and body fluids and has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. The healing of wound is a complex process that involves different steps: hemostasis, inflammation, remodeling/granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization. Inflammation and angiogenesis are two fundamental physiological conditions implicated in this process. We have recently developed a new method for the expression and purification of recombinant LL37. In this work, we show that the recombinant peptide P-LL37 with a N-terminus proline preserves its immunophysiological properties in vitro and in vivo. P-LL37 neutralized the activation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Besides, the peptide induced proliferation, migration and tubule-like structures formation by endothelial cells. Wound healing experiments were performed in dexamethasone-treated mice to study the effect of LL37 on angiogenesis and wound regeneration.

Histologically, HA and FG implanted animal groups showed significant angiogenetic activity, especially within the pores of the scaffold. However, formation of new blood vessels was more conspicuously observed at 4 weeks in FG than HA implants. Furthermore, by 8 weeks, the number and pattern of blood vessels were comparable between them. At this time, HA was still present indicating its slow degradation. The finding was confirmed by histomorphometric analysis. This experimental study demonstrates that HA containing composite scaffold systems permit stabile in-growth of blood vessels due to sustained degradation over 8 weeks.

Recently, novel reconstructive techniques using vascularized pedicled mucosal flaps have been applied to decrease this potential risk. Complete mucosal extirpation in the wound bed is not always feasible and the impact of insetting the flap over intact underlying mucosa is not clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of mucocele formation after nasoseptal flap reconstruction without mucosal stripping.\nThis is an Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective study consisting of 28 patients undergoing skull base reconstruction using a pedicled nasoseptal flap between 2008 and 2010 at a tertiary care hospital. In all cases the sinus or skull base mucosa surrounding the defect was left intact. Patients were followed postoperatively by endoscopy and/or imaging for evidence of mucocele formation in the reconstructive bed.\nThe total rate of mucocele formation was 3.6% (1 of 28, noted on postoperative day 46). The mean follow-up time was 243 \u00b1 174 days (range, 46-585 days). Eleven patients were followed for over 1 year. All flaps remained viable and well vascularized.\nThe pedicled nasoseptal flap is an effective means of reconstruction after endoscopic skull base surgery.

In the present study, we aimed at investigating the origins of adipose stem cells. \u03b1-SMA (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin) is one of the markers of pericytes. We harvested ASCs (adipose stromal cells) from \u03b1-SMA-GFP (green fluorescent protein) transgenic mice and sorted them into GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells by FACS. Multilineage differentiation tests were applied to examine the pluripotent ability of the \u03b1-SMA-GFP-positive and -negative cells. Immunofluorescent staining for \u03b1-SMA and PDGF-R\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2) were applied to identify the \u03b1-SMA-GFP-positive cells. Then \u03b1-SMA-GFP-positive cells were loaded on a collagen-fibronectin gel with endothelial cells to test their vascularization ability both in vitro and in vivo. Results show that, in adipose tissue, all of the \u03b1-SMA-GFP-positive cells congregate around the blood vessels.

While most of these tumors are discovered incidentally during emergency laparotomy or in the clinical setting of unknown primary cancer with hepatic metastases, the growing awareness of this rare entity and improved diagnostic methods promote earlier diagnosis. The classical carcinoid syndrome with flush, diarrhea and cardiac strain is observed only in 20-30% of patients. The clinical symptoms necessitate a special preoperative preparation of the patient including evaluation of cardiac function.Prospective studies assessing the efficacy of surgical treatment strategies for neuroendocrine neoplasms of the small intestine do not exist. However, retrospective studies have demonstrated that curative as well as palliative resection of the primary tumor improves the prognosis and the quality of life of patients. Besides limited resection of the small bowel in order to avoid postoperative short bowel syndrome an effective clearance of the regional lymph nodes is essential. A primary tumor site in the terminal ileum requires dissection of the lymph nodes on the right side of the ileocolic artery which usually implies an additional resection of the right colon.

In this study, we identified a novel subpopulation of adult progenitor cells positive for CD34 and M-cadherin (CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207a BMCs) in mouse and human bone marrow. We also examined the long-lasting therapeutic efficacy of mouse CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207a BMCs in restoring blood flow and promoting vascularization in an atherosclerotic mouse model of PAD.\nColony-forming cell assays and flow cytometry analysis showed that CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207a BMCs have hematopoietic progenitor properties. When delivered intra-arterially into the ischemic hindlimbs of ApoE\u207b/\u207b mice, CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207a BMCs alleviated ischemia and significantly improved blood flow compared with CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207b BMCs, CD34\u207b/M-cad\u207a BMCs, or unselected BMCs.

Furthermore, histologic assessment and morphometric analyses of hindlimbs treated with GFP\u207a CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207a cells showed that injected cells incorporated into solid tissue structures at 21 days. Confocal microscopic examination of GFP\u207a CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207a cell-treated ischemic legs followed by immunostaining indicated the vascular differentiation of CD34\u207a/M-cad\u207a progenitor cells.

{"title": "Scaffolds for dental pulp tissue engineering.", "abstract": "For tissue engineering strategies, the choice of an appropriate scaffold is the first and certainly a crucial step. A vast variety of biomaterials is available: natural or synthetic polymers, extracellular matrix, self-assembling systems, hydrogels, or bioceramics. Each material offers a unique chemistry, composition and structure, degradation profile, and possibility for modification. The role of the scaffold has changed from passive carrier toward a bioactive matrix, which can induce a desired cellular behavior. Tailor-made materials for specific applications can be created. Recent approaches to generate dental pulp rely on established materials, such as collagen, polyester, chitosan, or hydroxyapatite. Results after transplantation show soft connective tissue formation and newly generated dentin. For dentin-pulp-complex engineering, aspects including vascularization, cell-matrix interactions, growth-factor incorporation, matrix degradation, mineralization, and contamination control should be considered. Self-assembling peptide hydrogels are an example of a smart material that can be modified to create customized matrices. Rational design of the peptide sequence allows for control of material stiffness, induction of mineral nucleation, or introduction of antibacterial activity. Cellular responses can be evoked by the incorporation of cell adhesion motifs, enzyme-cleavable sites, and suitable growth factors.

The dynamic relationship between these two processes is now evaluated with tunicamycin. Capillary endothelial cells treated with tunicamycin were growth inhibited and could not be reversed with exogenous VEGF(165). Inhibition of angiogenesis is supported by down-regulation of (i) phosphorylated VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptors; (ii) VEGF(165)-specific phosphotyrosine kinase activity; and (iii) Matrigel(TM) invasion and chemotaxis. In vivo, tunicamycin prevented the vessel development in Matrigel(TM) implants in athymic Balb/c (nu/nu) mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD34 (p < 0.001) and CD144 (p < 0.001) exhibited reduced vascularization. A 3.8-fold increased expression of TSP-1, an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor in Matrigel(TM) implants correlated with that in tunicamycin (32 h)-treated capillary endothelial cells.

Second, the in vivo aspect was studied by subcutaneous transplantation of encapsulated BM-MSCs and AMSCs in diabetic rats and assessment of the cells' angiogenic properties as described above. Diabetic state and islet encapsulation induced a significant decrease of oxygenation of the subcutaneous implant and an increased number of cells expressing VEGF.

{"title": "CD133+ glioblastoma stem-like cells induce vascular mimicry in vivo.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the most angiogenic malignancy, the neoplastic vessels of which are likely to arise by angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. An alternative mechanism of tumor vasculature is described, termed vasculogenic mimicry, by which highly aggressive tumor cells can form vessel-like structures themselves, by virtue of their high cellular plasticity. Evidence suggests that cancer stem cells acquire a multi-potent plastic phenotype and show vasculogenic potential. In this study, we report that glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) can form vasculogenic mimicry in tumor xenografts and express pro-vascular molecules. We isolated GSCs from resected human glioblastoma tissues and demonstrated their stemness, differentiation, and in vivo tumor-initiating potential. Through a limiting dilution assay, CD133+ (CD133(+)-GSC) and CD133- (CD133(-)-GSC) subpopulation of GSCs were obtained. Orthotopic xenotransplantation study revealed that these two subpopulations of GSCs shared similar efficacy in tumor formation but showed distinct intratumor vasculature. In comparison with CD133(-)-GSC, a highly vascularized anaplastic tumor, mimicking vasculogenic mimicry, was found in CD133(+)-GSC-derived tumor xenografts. Subsets of CD133(+)-GSC but not CD133(-)-GSC were capable of vascular smooth muscle-like cell differentiation, in vitro and in vivo. In tumor xenografts, endothelium-associated CD31 gene was detected in implanted CD133(-)-GSC and exclusively dispersed within the tumor tissues. Although the detailed action mechanisms required further investigation, this study demonstrated the vasculogenic capacity of brain GSCs and their cellular plasticity.

{"title": "Quantitative analysis of cancer metastasis using an avian embryo model.", "abstract": "During metastasis cancer cells disseminate from the primary tumor, invade into surrounding tissues, and spread to distant organs. Metastasis is a complex process that can involve many tissue types, span variable time periods, and often occur deep within organs, making it difficult to investigate and quantify. In addition, the efficacy of the metastatic process is influenced by multiple steps in the metastatic cascade making it difficult to evaluate the contribution of a single aspect of tumor cell behavior. As a consequence, metastasis assays are frequently performed in experimental animals to provide a necessarily realistic context in which to study metastasis. Unfortunately, these models are further complicated by their complex physiology. The chick embryo is a unique in vivo model that overcomes many limitations to studying metastasis, due to the accessibility of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), a well-vascularized extra-embryonic tissue located underneath the eggshell that is receptive to the xenografting of tumor cells (figure 1). Moreover, since the chick embryo is naturally immunodeficient, the CAM readily supports the engraftment of both normal and tumor tissues. Most importantly, the avian CAM successfully supports most cancer cell characteristics including growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and remodeling of the microenvironment. This makes the model exceptionally useful for the investigation of the pathways that lead to cancer metastasis and to predict the response of metastatic cancer to new potential therapeutics. The detection of disseminated cells by species-specific Alu PCR makes it possible to quantitatively assess metastasis in organs that are colonized by as few as 25 cells. Using the Human Epidermoid Carcinoma cell line (HEp3) we use this model to analyze spontaneous metastasis of cancer cells to distant organs, including the chick liver and lung.

An algorithm of which time to use, which tool to detect the correct SN by preoperative ultrasound (US) in combination with an US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) will be proposed and demonstrated using five clinical examples. All examples prove the advantage of a combined strategy to track down the correct and involved SN. A sensitive US power mode, for the amplification of even the slightest changes in vascularization, is the most important tool in our diagnostic preoperative approach. First, reliable US criteria, as recently published must consequently be applied. Second, a FNAC should be performed early enough, even when only early signs are visible.

Seventeen fresh human cadaveric elbows were sequentially plastinated beginning with arterial injection, followed by block and slice plastination of the whole elbow. With this technique, we obtained completely transparent cadaveric slices in which the peri- and intraosseous vascular architecture could be studied in its neutral position. In six of these elbows, radial head osteosynthesis was imitated with miniplates or fine threaded K-wires. Vascularization of the radial head occurred via branches of the radial recurrent artery on the ventral, lateral, and dorsal sides of the radial head and a branch of the ulnar artery--ramus periostalis ulnaris--medially and dorsomedially. Both arteries create a pericervical arterial ring around the radial neck. A branch of the interosseous artery--R. interosseous recurrence--supports the ventral and dorsal sides of the radial neck and the final branches of the nutrient artery support intraosseous vascularization. Vascular structures were damaged more severely by plates than by screws. The peri- and intraosseous vascularization of the radial head and the interaction between vascularization and the implants was shown. Plate fixation of radial head fractures leads to a higher level of implant-related destruction of the periosseous vascularization than screw fixation.

{"title": "A short-term in vivo model for giant cell tumor of bone.", "abstract": "Because of the lack of suitable in vivo models of giant cell tumor of bone (GCT), little is known about its underlying fundamental pro-tumoral events, such as tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. There is no existing cell line that contains all the cell and tissue tumor components of GCT and thus in vitro testing of anti-tumor agents on GCT is not possible. In this study we have characterized a new method of growing a GCT tumor on a chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) for this purpose.\nFresh tumor tissue was obtained from 10 patients and homogenized. The suspension was grafted onto the CAM at day 10 of development. The growth process was monitored by daily observation and photo documentation using in vivo biomicroscopy. After 6 days, samples were fixed and further analyzed using standard histology (hematoxylin and eosin stains), Ki67 staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nThe suspension of all 10 patients formed solid tumors when grafted on the CAM. In vivo microscopy and standard histology revealed a rich vascularization of the tumors. The tumors were composed of the typical components of GCT, including (CD51+/CD68+) multinucleated giant cells which were generally less numerous and contained fewer nuclei than in the original tumors. Ki67 staining revealed a very low proliferation rate. The FISH demonstrated that the tumors were composed of human cells interspersed with chick-derived capillaries.\nA reliable protocol for grafting of human GCT onto the chick chorio-allantoic membrane is established.

Therefore, the assessment of expression of c-myc in endothelial cells and neovascularization could help to determine the biological behavior of the tumor. We analyzed neovascularization and c-myc expression in 36 medulloblastoma specimens. The results were shown by determining immunohistochemical staining index (ISI), the sum of staining intensity (SI) and the percentage of positive cells (PPC) in the blood vessels endothelium of the tumor. We also performed the microvessel count (MVC) in 10 high-power fields (400X) with the most prominent vascularization and expressed it as microvessel density per mm2 (MVD). C-myc immunostaining intensity index in blood vessel endothelium is grouped into four groups, 0--no reaction, I-weak reaction (ISI = 1 or 2), II--moderate reaction (ISI = 3 or 4), III--strong reaction (ISI = 5 or 6). Statistically significant differences (p = 0.0214) have been found between groups 0 and 1 compared to groups 2 and 3.

This study reports a novel function of C/EBP-\u03b4 in lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Genetic deletion of C/EBP-\u03b4 in mice resulted in a significant reduction of lymphangiogenesis and pulmonary metastases, with a dramatic reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and its cognate receptor VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR3) in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). By contrast, no difference of VEGF-C in tumor tissues and bone marrow was observed between null and wild-type mice. Consistently, forced expression of C/EBP-\u03b4 increased VEGF-C and VEGFR3 expression in cultured LECs. These findings suggest a specific and important role of C/EBP-\u03b4 in the regulation of VEGFR3 signaling in LECs. Furthermore, expression of C/EBP-\u03b4 in cultured LECs significantly increased cell motility, and knockdown of C/EBP-\u03b4 inhibited cell motility and lymphatic vascular network formation in vitro. Forced expression of VEGF-C, but not recombinant VEGF-C, rescued the knockdown of C/EBP-\u03b4-induced cell apoptosis, indicative of autonomous VEGF-C autocrine signaling essential for LEC survival. Moreover, hypoxia induces C/EBP-\u03b4 expression and C/EBP-\u03b4 regulates HIF-1\u03b1 expression.

The relationship between pore size and vascularization has been examined for hydrophobic polymer foams, but there has been little research on tissue response in porous hydrogels. The goal of this study was to examine the role of pore size on vessel invasion in porous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels. Vascularized tissue ingrowth was examined using three-dimensional cell culture and rodent models. In culture, all porous gels supported vascular invasion with the rate increasing with pore size. Following subfascial implantation, porous gels rapidly absorbed wound fluid, which promoted tissue ingrowth even in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Pore size influenced neovascularization, within the scaffolds and also the overall tissue response. Cell and vessel invasion into gels with pores 25-50 \u03bcm in size was limited to the external surface, while gels with pores larger pores (50-100 and 100-150 \u03bcm) permitted mature vascularized tissue formation throughout the entire material volume.

Thymosin \u03b24 (T\u03b24), a 43-amino acid peptide, is both angiogenic and cardioprotective. T\u03b24 in soluble form was previously shown to promote cell migration from quiescent adult cardiac explants. Here we developed a collagen-chitosan hydrogel for the encapsulation of T\u03b24, which allowed its controlled release over 28days to elicit localized and prolonged effects. Contrastingly, T\u03b24 was fully released over 3days when encapsulated in collagen-only hydrogels due to charge repulsion and lack of interconnected pores as shown by SEM. The charge of encapsulated molecules affected their release from collagen-chitosan hydrogels. While the release of neutral polyalanine was size-controlled diffusion, that of negatively-charged T\u03b24 and positively-charged polylysine was affected by electrostatic interactions of peptides with collagen/chitosan molecules. Hydrogels with encapsulated T\u03b24 significantly increased cell migration and outgrowth of CD31-positive capillaries from mouse and rat epicardial explants in vitro, compared to T\u03b24-free and soluble controls. Potential advantage of T\u03b24 over commonly-used angiogenic growth factors is that it can induce recruitment and differentiation of both endothelial and smooth muscle cells necessary for vascular stability.

Reexpression of Cdc42 in mutant EBs rescues the mutant phenotype, establishing an essential role for Cdc42 in vasculogenesis. Chimeric analysis revealed that the vascular phenotype is caused by inactivation of Cdc42 in endothelial cells rather than surrounding cells. Endothelial cells isolated from Cdc42-null EBs are defective in directional migration and network assembly. In addition, activation of atypical protein kinase C\u03b9 (PKC\u03b9) is abolished in Cdc42-null endothelial cells, and PKC\u03b9 ablation phenocopies the vascular abnormalities of the Cdc42-null EBs. Moreover, the inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) at Ser9 depends on Cdc42 and PKC\u03b9, and expression of kinase-dead GSK-3\u03b2 in Cdc42-null EBs promotes the formation of linear endothelial segments without branches.

Autologously derived muscles could be engineered for replacement tissue, but must be vascularized and innervated to be functional.

This study utilized a self-assembly process to engineer three-dimensional (3D) muscle from a statically strained muscle cell monolayer. Primary mouse myoblasts (PMMs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were separately proliferated and coseeded on a fibrin sheet with anchored sutures. Within 10 days of initiating PMM differentiation, the cell-gel layer contracted, lifted, and rolled into a cylindrical 3D structure around the tendon-like suture anchors; the myotubes longitudinally aligned along the lines of tensile force. The objectives of this study were to characterize these engineered muscles and to elucidate the role of the fibroblasts in the self-assembly process. Fibroblasts maintained myotube viability, mediated fibrin degradation, and assisted in muscle self-assembly. The optimal 1:1 PMM:MEF ratio resulted in tissue morphology remarkably similar to native muscle.

{"title": "Brain microvascular pericytes in health and disease.", "abstract": "Pericytes are located at periphery of the microvessel wall and wrap it with their processes. They communicate with other cells of the neurovascular unit by direct contact or through signaling pathways and regulate several important microcirculatory functions. These include development and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), distribution of the capillary blood flow to match the local metabolic need of the nearby cells, and angiogenesis. Pericytes also exhibit phagocytic activity and may function as pluripotent stem cells. Increasing evidence suggests a role for pericytes in a wide range of CNS diseases. They appear to be vulnerable to oxygen and nitrogen radical toxicity and have been shown to contract during cerebral ischemia and remain contracted despite reopening of the occluded artery. This causes impaired re-flow and may diminish the benefit of re-canalization therapies in stroke patients. Hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction of the signaling pathways between pericytes and endothelia is thought to play an important role in diabetic retinopathy, a common cause of blindness. Amyloid deposits detected within degenerating pericytes in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease suggest that pericyte dysfunction may play a role in cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid \u03b2-peptide clearance in Alzheimer's disease. This exciting possibility may reveal a novel temporal sequence of events in chronic neurodegeneration, in which microvascular dysfunction due to pericyte degeneration initiates secondary neurodegenerative changes. Identification of molecular mechanisms by which pericytes regulate BBB integrity in inflammatory conditions as well as in vasogenic brain edema may lead to new treatments.

Previous studies have shown that topical application of HMGB1 to skin wounds of mouse models of diabetes enhanced vessel density and accelerated wound healing, suggesting that diabetes may affect endogenous HMGB1 functions. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV/CD26) is a protease whose activity is increased in diabetes and whose inhibition improves glucose tolerance. Since HMGB1 contains potential DPP-IV cleavage sites, we determined whether HMGB1 may be a substrate for DPP-IV and whether DPP-IV-mediated cleavage may alter the biological activity of HMGB1.\nReversed phase HPLC, mass spectrometry and western blot analyses were performed to analyse and identify HMGB1 peptides generated following DPP-IV digestion. HMGB1 angiogenic functions in the presence of DPP-IV were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. HMGB1 protein was detected in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients before and after treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors.\nDPP-IV cleaved HMGB1 at its N-terminal region and affected its angiogenic functions. Specifically, DPP-IV inhibited HMGB1-induced endothelial cell migration and capillary-like structure formation, as well as HMGB1-mediated vascular network formation in Matrigel implants in mice. We had previously found that HMGB1 promoted endothelial cell migration through activation of extracellular regulated kinase signalling pathway. Here we showed that such an effect was abolished in the presence of DPP-IV. Finally, the N-terminal truncated form of HMGB1 was detected in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, in whom DPP-IV inhibitors enhanced the levels of full-length HMGB1.\nDPP-IV cleaves HMGB1 and, via this mechanism, inhibits HMGB1 angiogenic activity.

However, patients with ACL reconstruction had significantly longer return-to-activity times (mean 8.23 mo vs. 5.56 mo) and significantly lower Tegner scores (mean 6.8 vs. 8.0) than patients without simultaneous reconstruction.\nThe clinical results after arthroscopic meniscus repair in the adolescent were excellent, despite long average time from injury to surgery and a high number of tears in poorly vascularized areas. Meniscal tears in skeletally immature athletes may have greater reparative potential, with and without simultaneous ligament reconstruction. Attempts at repair regardless of time from injury or location of tear should be strongly considered in this age group.\nLevel III retrospective cohort series.", "journal": "Journal of pediatric orthopedics", "date": "2011-06-10", "authors": ["Kelly LVanderhave", "James EMoravek", "Jon KSekiya", "Edward MWojtys"], "doi": "10.1097/BPO.0b013e31821ffb8d"}

{"title": "Non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma induces angiogenesis through reactive oxygen species.", "abstract": "Vascularization plays a key role in processes such as wound healing and tissue engineering. Non-thermal plasma, which primarily produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), has recently emerged as an efficient tool in medical applications including blood coagulation, sterilization and malignant cell apoptosis. Liquids and porcine aortic endothelial cells were treated with a non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma in vitro. Plasma treatment of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum-free medium increased ROS concentration in a dose-dependent manner, with a higher concentration observed in serum-free medium compared with PBS. Species concentration inside cells peaked 1 h after treatment, followed by a decrease 3 h post treatment. Endothelial cells treated with a plasma dose of 4.2 J cm(-2) had 1.7 times more cells than untreated samples 5 days after plasma treatment. The 4.2 J cm(-2) plasma dose increased two-dimensional migration distance by 40 per cent compared with untreated control, while the number of cells that migrated through a three-dimensional collagen gel increased by 15 per cent. Tube formation was also enhanced by plasma treatment, with tube lengths in plasma-treated samples measuring 2.6 times longer than control samples. A fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) neutralizing antibody and ROS scavengers abrogated these angiogenic effects. These data indicate that plasma enhanced proliferation, migration and tube formation is due to FGF-2 release induced by plasma-produced ROS.

{"title": "The case of thyroid hormones: how to learn physiology by solving a detective case.", "abstract": "Thyroid diseases are prevalent among endocrine disorders, and careful evaluation of patients' symptoms is a very important part in their diagnosis. Developing new pedagogical strategies, such as problem-based learning (PBL), is extremely important to stimulate and encourage medical and biomedical students to learn thyroid physiology and identify the signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. The present study aimed to create a new pedagogical approach to build deep knowledge about hypo-/hyperthyroidism by proposing a hands-on activity based on a detective case, using alternative materials in place of laboratory animals. After receiving a description of a criminal story involving changes in thyroid hormone economy, students collected data from clues, such as body weight, mesenteric vascularization, visceral fat, heart and thyroid size, heart rate, and thyroid-stimulating hormone serum concentration to solve the case. Nevertheless, there was one missing clue for each panel of data. Four different materials were proposed to perform the same practical lesson. Animals, pictures, small stuffed toy rats, and illustrations were all effective to promote learning, and the detective case context was considered by students as inviting and stimulating. The activity can be easily performed independently of the institution's purchasing power. The practical lesson stimulated the scientific method of data collection and organization, discussion, and review of thyroid hormone actions to solve the case. Hence, this activity provides a new strategy and alternative materials to teach without animal euthanization.", "journal": "Advances in physiology education", "date": "2011-06-10", "authors": ["CamiloLellis-Santos", "GiseleGiannocco", "Maria TerezaNunes"], "doi": "10.1152/advan.00135.2010"}

{"title": "Tunable dual growth factor delivery from polyelectrolyte multilayer films.", "abstract": "A promising strategy to accelerate joint implant integration and reduce recovery time and failure rates is to deliver a combination of certain growth factors to the integration site. There is a need to control the quantity of growth factors delivered at different times during the healing process to maximize efficacy. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films, built using the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique, are attractive for releasing controlled amounts of potent growth factors over a sustained period. Here, we present PEM films that sequester physiological amounts of osteogenic rhBMP-2 (recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2) and angiogenic rhVEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085 (recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor) in different ratios in a degradable [poly(\u03b2-amino ester)/polyanion/growth factor/polyanion] LbL tetralayer repeat architecture where the biologic load scaled linearly with the number of tetralayers. No burst release of either growth factor was observed as the films degraded. The release of rhBMP-2 was sustained over a period of 2 weeks, while rhVEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085 eluted from the film over the first 8 days. Both growth factors retained their efficacy, as quantified with relevant in vitro assays. rhBMP-2 initiated a dose dependent differentiation cascade in MC3T3-E1S4 pre-osteoblasts while rhVEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085 upregulated HUVEC proliferation, and accelerated closure of a scratch in HUVEC cell cultures in a dose dependent manner. In vivo, the mineral density of ectopic bone formed de novo by rhBMP-2/rhVEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085 PEM films was approximately 33% higher than when only rhBMP-2 was introduced, with a higher trabecular thickness, which would indicate a decrease in the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Bone formed throughout the scaffold when both growth factors were released, which suggests more complete remodeling due to an increased local vascular network.

The aim of this study was to produce one disintegrin-like cloned from Bothrops leucurus venom gland and to characterize it regarding biological activity. The recombinant protein was purified by one step procedure involving anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-cellulose) and presented a molecular mass of 10.4 kDa. The purified protein was able to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by collagen (IC\u2085\u2080 = 0.65 \u03bcM) and to inhibit growth of Ehrlich tumor implanted in mice by more than 50% after 7 days administration of 10 \u03bcg/day. No effects were observed upon adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-and arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation. The recombinant protein was recognized by an antibody specific for jararhagin one metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops jararaca venom, and therefore it was named leucurogin. Anti-angiogenesis effect of leucurogin was evaluated by the sponge implant model. After 7 days administration leucurogin inhibited, in a dose dependent way, the vascularization process in the sponge.

{"title": "Glioblastoma cells: a heterogeneous and fatal tumor interacting with the parenchyma.", "abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBMs) are considered to be one of the deadliest human cancers, characterized by a high proliferative rate, aggressive invasiveness and insensitivity to radio- and chemotherapy, as well as a short patient survival period. Moreover, GBMs are among the most vascularized and invasive cancers in humans. Angiogenesis in GBMs is correlated with the grade of malignancy and is inversely correlated with patient survival. One of the first steps in tumor invasions is migration. GBM cells have the ability to infiltrate and disrupt physical barriers such as basement membranes, extracellular matrix and cell junctions. The invasion process includes the overexpression of several members of a super-family of zinc-based proteinases, the Metzincin, in particular a sub-group, metalloproteinases. Another interesting aspect is that, inside the GBM tissue, there are up to 30% of microglia or macrophages. However, little is known about the immune performance and interactions of the microglia with GBMs. These singular properties of GBMs will be described here. A sub-population of cells with stem-like properties may be the source of tumors since, apparently, GBM stem cells (GSCs) are highly resistant to current cancer treatments. These cancer therapies, while killing the majority of tumor cells, ultimately fail in GBM treatment because they do not eliminate GSCs, which survive to regenerate new tumors. Finally, GBM patient prognostic has shown little improvement in decades. In this context, we will discuss how the membrane-acting toxins called cytolysins can be a potential new tool for GBM treatment.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2011-06-07", "authors": ["Tercia RodriguesAlves", "Flavia Regina SouzaLima", "Suzana AssadKahn", "DeniseLobo", "Luiz Gustavo Feij\u00f3Dubois", "RossanaSoletti", "HelenaBorges", "Vivaldo MouraNeto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2011.04.022"}

In this study, a growth factor (GF)/heparin-immobilized collagen gel-filled polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold was developed for angiogenesis induction and hepatocyte transplantation. First, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/heparin-immobilized, collagen-gel-filled PUF scaffold was developed to establish a prevascularized cavity in the subcutaneous space in rats. Second, accompanied by 70% partial hepatectomy (PH), hepatocytes were embedded inside heparin-immobilized, collagen-gel-filled PUF scaffolds, and were transplanted into the VEGF-induced prevascularized cavity. The benefits of using this system were confirmed by using three types of hepatocytes, namely single hepatocyte, hepatocyte spheroids, and fetal hepatocytes. The normalized hemoglobin content and live nucleus numbers were determined separately to evaluate the angiogenesis and viability of transplanted hepatocytes.

While this assessment is justified for cytotoxic (chemotherapeutic) drugs, it is now recognized that morphological imaging protocols are poorly suited to the evaluation of the efficacy of novel signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) which exhibit cytostatic rather than cytotoxic properties. New imaging technologies are now designed to evaluate, in a functional manner, modifications in tumor metabolic activity, cellularity, and vascularization before a reduction in tumor volume can be detected. Introduction of physiological imaging end-points, derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging protocols--including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US)--allow for early assessment of disruption in tumor perfusion and permeability for targeted anti-angiogenic agents. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) provides another physiological imaging end-point since tumor necrosis and cellularity are seen early in response to anti-angiogenic treatment. Changes in glucose and phospholipid turnover, based on metabolic MRI and positron emission tomography (PET), provide reliable markers for therapeutic response to novel receptor-targeting agents.

Current antiangiogenic therapies have been designed on the assumption that endothelial cells forming the tumor vasculature exhibit genetic stability. Recent studies demonstrate that this is not the case. Tumor endothelial cells possess a distinct phenotype, differing from normal endothelial cells at both molecular and functional levels. This challenges the concept that tumor angiogenesis exclusively depends on normal endothelial cell recruitment from the surrounding vascular network. Indeed, recent data suggest alternative strategies for tumor vascularization. It has been reported that tumor vessels may derive from an intratumor embryonic-like vasculogenesis. This condition might be due to differentiation of normal stem and progenitor cells of hematopoietic origin or resident in tissues. Cancer stem cells may also participate in tumor vasculogenesis by virtue of their stem and progenitor cell properties. Finally, normal endothelial cells might be reprogrammed to a proangiogenic or dedifferentiated phenotype by genetic information transmitted from the tumor trough apoptotic bodies, or following mRNA and microRNA transfer by exosomes and microvesicles.

To examine the significance of Ron in prostate cancer in vivo, we utilized a genetically engineered mouse model, referred to as TRAMP mice, that is predisposed to develop prostate tumors. In this model, we show that prostate tumors from 30-week-old TRAMP mice have increased Ron expression compared with age-matched wild-type prostates. Based on the upregulation of Ron in human prostate cancers and in this murine model of prostate tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that this receptor has a functional role in the development of prostate tumors. To test this hypothesis, we crossed TRAMP mice with mice that are deficient in Ron signaling (TK-/-). Interestingly, TK-/- TRAMP+ mice show a significant decrease in prostate tumor mass relative to TRAMP mice containing functional Ron. Moreover, TK-/- TRAMP+ prostate tumors exhibited decreased tumor vascularization relative to TK+/+ TRAMP+ prostate tumors, which correlated with reduced levels of the angiogenic molecules vascular endothelial growth factor and CXCL2. Although Ron loss did not alter tumor cell proliferation, a significant decrease in cell survival was observed. Similarly, murine prostate cancer cell lines containing a Ron deficiency exhibited decreased levels of active nuclear factor-\u03baB, suggesting that Ron may be important in regulating prostate cell survival at least partly through this pathway.

Numerous studies have demonstrated increased flux through this pathway contributes to the development of \u03b2-cell dysfunction. The effect of decreased O-GlcNAc on the maintenance of normal \u03b2-cell function, however, is not well understood. We studied transgenic mice that over express \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase), an enzyme that catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins, in the pancreatic \u03b2-cell under control of the rat insulin promoter. 3-4-Month-old O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice have higher glucose excursions with a concomitant decrease in circulating insulin levels, insulin mRNA levels, and total islet insulin content. In older (8-9-month-old) O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice glucose tolerance is no longer impaired. This is associated with increased serum insulin, islet insulin content, and insulin mRNA in the O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice. These improvements in \u03b2-cell function with aging are associated with increased angiogenesis and increased VEGF expression, with parallel increases in activation of Akt and expression of PGC1\u03b1. The biphasic effects as a function of age are consistent with published observations of mice with increased O-GlcNAc in islets and demonstrate that O-GlcNAc signaling exerts multiple effects on both insulin secretion and islet survival.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2011-05-31", "authors": ["YudiSoesanto", "BaiLuo", "GlendonParker", "DeborahJones", "Robert CCooksey", "Donald AMcClain"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M111.249508"}

To explore the role of TF in biological processes of lung adenocarcinoma, we used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to silence TF in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 with high-level expression of TF and evaluate its antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo.\nThe specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed for targeting human TF was transfected into A549 cells. The expression of TF was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT and clonogenic assays. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The metastatic potential of A549 cells was determined by wound healing, the mobility and Matrigel invasion assays. Expressions of PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, VEGF and MMP-2/-9 in transfected cells were detected by Western blot. In vivo, the effect of TF-siRNA on the growth of A549 lung adenocarcinoma xenografts in nude mice was investigated.\nTF -siRNA significantly reduced the expression of TF in the mRNA and protein levels. The down-regulation of TF in A549 cells resulted in the suppression of cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis and induced cell apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. Erk MAPK, PI3K/Akt pathways as well as VEGF and MMP-2/-9 expressions were inhibited in TF-siRNA transfected cells. Moreover, intratumoral injection of siRNA targeting TF suppressed the tumor growth of A549 cells in vivo model of lung adenocarcinoma.\nDown-regulation of TF using siRNA could provide a potential approach for gene therapy against lung adenocarcinoma, and the antitumor effects may be associated with inhibition of Erk MAPK, PI3K/Akt pathways.", "journal": "Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR", "date": "2011-05-31", "authors": ["ChengchengXu", "QiGui", "WenshuChen", "LeimingWu", "WeiSun", "NiZhang", "QinziXu", "JianingWang", "XiangningFu"], "doi": "10.1186/1756-9966-30-63\n10.3322/caac.20073\n10.3322/canjclin.55.2.74\n10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181d5e47f\n10.1097/JTO.0b013e31817c1b21\n10.1002/1097-0142(19920901)70:5<1194::AID-CNCR2820700528>3.0.CO;2-E\n10.1016/j.beha.2008.11.002\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2482\n10.1002/ijc.20527\n10.1038/nrg2006\n10.1093/nar/30.8.1757\n10.1007/s00432-010-0776-0\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.12.181\n10.1073/pnas.94.13.6922\n10.1182/blood-2007-07-101048\n10.1007/BF02981930\n10.1038/nrc865\n10.1016/S0169-5002(03)00230-7\n10.1002/ijc.21183\n10.1002/path.2282\n10.1007/s10555-006-7886-9\n10.1038/nm0296-167\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980220)79:1<19::AID-IJC4>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1182/blood-2004-05-2042\n10.1007/s00894-003-0157-6\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64675-5\n10.1038/nrc2069\n10.1126/science.275.5300.661\n10.1080/10611860801890093"}

The aim of this study is to report the results of treatment using a free flap procedure followed by ipsilateral vascularized fibular transposition (IVFT) for reconstruction of composite tibial defects. Ten patients underwent a free flap procedure followed by IVFT and plating. The mean size of the flaps was 12.1 \u00d7 6 cm(2). The mean length of bone defect was 5.35 cm. IVFT were performed 4.3 months following the free flap. Patients were followed for an average of 3.4 years. All flaps survived. The average time to union of the proximal and distal ends was 5.2 and 6.7 months, respectively. There were neither stress fractures of the transferred fibula nor recurrent infections. One patient demonstrated a medial angulation of 8\u00b0 in the reconstructed tibia but experienced no difficulties in activities of daily living. At the last follow-up time point, all patients were able to walk without an assist device and were satisfied with the preservation of the injured lower extremity. Free flap procedures followed by IVFT for the treatment of composite tibial defects may reduce complications at the recipient site and infections, such as osteomyelitis. The plating technique combined with IVFT allowed bone union without additional operations or stress fractures in our series.

The hardness of the tissues was analyzed using transient USE (ShearWave, Aixplorer-SuperSonic Imagine). PET/CT scanning was performed with a Philips Gemini GXL camera (GE Medical Systems). In the first patient, US examination revealed a compressive multinodular goiter with large solid hypoechoic and poorly vascularized areas adjacent to the nodules. The predominant right nodule was hypoechoic with irregular margins. The second patient had a hypoechoic goiter with large bilateral hypoechoic areas. In both cases, an unusual feature was observed: the presence of tissue surrounding the primitive carotid artery, associated with thrombi of the internal jugular vein. Further, USE showed heterogeneity in the stiffness values of the thyroid parenchyma varying between 21 kPa and 281 kPa. FDG-PET/CT imaging showed uptake foci in the thyroid gland.

It particularly focuses on results obtained as a result of pre-operative and neoadjuvant therapy in which primary breast cancers have been biopsied or excised before and during treatment with letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane. Studies may be subdivided into those evaluating early (10-14 days) or late (3-4 months) changes; a single investigation charted sequential changes. Early changes involved downregulation of genes classically induced by oestrogen or associated with cell cycle and proliferation. In contrast, expressions of genes associated with stromal signatures were upregulated. Considerably more genes were changed at later time-points; these probably represent not only primary effects on cellular expression but secondary consequences of cell death and clonal selection. Thus, after 3-4 months of treatment mitochondrial-related genes and those associated with cell cycle and cell division were downregulated whereas genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, vascularization, inflammatory responses and cell adhesion were upregulated. Recently, observations have been reported from a study in which tumours were sequentially sampled to include pretreatment and both early and later time-points. This allowed direct monitoring of the dynamic changes in gene expression. Different patterns of changes in gene expression were identified which were also associated with general differences in sub-cellular distribution of corresponding proteins.

Human outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) isolated from the mononuclear cell fraction of peripheral blood represent a potent population of circulating endothelial progenitors that could provide a cell source for rapid anastomosis and scaffold vascularization. Our previous work with these cells in co-culture with primary human osteoblasts has demonstrated their potential to form perfused vascular structures within a starch-poly(caprolactone) biomaterial in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrate the ability of OECs to form perfused vascular structures as early as 48 h following subcutaneous implantation of the biomaterial in vivo. The number of OEC-derived vessels increased throughout the study, an effect that was independent of the OEC donor. This finding of rapid and thorough OEC-mediated scaffold vascularization demonstrates the great potential for OEC-based strategies to promote vascularization in tissue engineering. OECs have the potential to contribute to host-derived scaffold vascularization, and formed vascular structures at a similar density as those arising from the host. Additionally, immunohistochemical evidence demonstrated the close interaction between OECs and the co-cultured osteoblasts.

Recent work has questioned long-held dogmas by showing that cancer-associated genetic alterations occur in cells and tissues not directly exposed to radiation, questioning the robustness of the current system of radiation risk assessment. In vitro, diverse mechanisms involving secreted soluble factors, gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) and oxidative metabolism are proposed to mediate these indirect effects. In vivo, the mechanisms behind long-range 'bystander' responses remain largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of GJIC in propagating radiation stress signals in vivo, and in mediating radiation-associated bystander tumorigenesis in mouse central nervous system using a mouse model in which intercellular communication is downregulated by targeted deletion of the connexin43 (Cx43) gene. We show that GJIC is critical for transmission of oncogenic radiation damage to the non-targeted cerebellum, and that a mechanism involving adenosine triphosphate release and upregulation of Cx43, the major GJIC constituent, regulates transduction of oncogenic damage to unirradiated tissues in vivo.

{"title": "Integrin-linked kinase: not so 'pseudo' after all.", "abstract": "Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a highly evolutionarily conserved intracellular protein that was originally identified as an integrin-interacting protein, and extensive genetic and biochemical studies have shown that ILK expression is vital during both embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. At the cellular and tissue levels, ILK regulates signaling pathways for cell adhesion-mediated cell survival (anoikis), apoptosis, proliferation and mitosis, migration, invasion, and vascularization and tumor angiogenesis. ILK also has central roles in cardiac and smooth-muscle contractility, and ILK dysregulation causes cardiomyopathies in humans. ILK protein levels are increased in several human cancers and often the expression level predicts poor patient outcome. Abundant evidence has accumulated suggesting that, of the diverse functions of ILK, some may require kinase activity whereas others depend on protein-protein interactions and are, therefore, independent of kinase activity. However, the past several years have seen an ongoing debate about whether ILK indeed functions as a protein serine/threonine kinase. This debate centers on the atypical protein kinase domain of ILK, which lacks some amino-acid residues thought to be essential for phosphotransferase activity. However, similar deficiencies are present in the catalytic domains of other kinases now known to possess protein kinase activity. Numerous studies have shown that ILK phosphorylates peptide substrates in vitro, corresponding to ILK-mediated phosphorylations in intact cells, and a recent report characterizing in vitro phosphotransferase activity of highly purified, full-length ILK, accompanied by detailed enzyme kinetic analyses, shows that, at least in vitro, ILK is a bona fide protein kinase. However, several genetic studies suggest that, not all biological functions of ILK require kinase activity, and that it can function as an adaptor/scaffold protein. Here, we review evidence for and against ILK being an active kinase, and provide a framework for strategies to further analyze the kinase and adaptor functions of ILK in different cellular contexts.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-05-24", "authors": ["G EHannigan", "P CMcDonald", "M PWalsh", "SDedhar"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.177"}

Subgroup A: median age at diagnosis 13.5 years, (range, 4 to 20 y). Primary sites were intracranial (n=5), thigh (n=3), calf (n=1), foot (n=1), and scalp (n=1). One patient who presented with a thigh HPC had metastatic disease at diagnosis, and 3 patients with head location had unresectable tumors. Two patients with thigh location experienced objective responses to chemotherapy. Six patients died of disease progression, 4 of them had an intracranial location. The remaining 5 children are alive at follow-up of 12 to 32 years. Subgroup B: median age at diagnosis 0.5 months (range, 0 to 3 mo). Primary sites were thigh (n=2), calf (n=1), perianal (n=1), forearm (n=1), and lung (n=1). Three patients with limb location had unresectable disease at diagnosis, 2 of them experienced excellent responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 1 did not show any response to chemotherapy and a staged resection was performed. All 6 infants are alive without evidence of disease at follow-up of 2 to 27 years.\nInfantile HPC is characterized by a better clinical behavior than the adult type, which requires an aggressive multimodality therapy. Chemoresponsiveness and spontaneous regression have been reported in children younger than 1 year, suggesting that a more conservative surgical approach should be used.

We proposed a theoretical reactive model to study the role of initial conditions, random motility, haptotaxis and chemotaxis in interactions with fibronectin factors and transforming angiogenic factors. The application of governing equations concerned a canine experimental implant and numerical experiments based upon statistical designs of experiments supported the discussion. We found that chemotaxis due to transforming angiogenic factors was attracting endothelial cells present into the host bone. Haptotaxis conditioned by fibronectin factors favored cells adhesion to the host bone. The combination of diffusive and reactive effects nourished the wave front migration of endothelial cells from the host bone towards the implant.

Organ or tissue printing by means of three-dimensional (3D) fiber deposition is a novel modality in regenerative medicine that combines pore formation and defined cell placement, and is used here for development of cell-laden hydrogel structures with reproducible internal architecture to sustain oxygen supply and to support adequate tissue development. In this study we tested the effect of porosity on multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) embedded in hydrogel constructs printed with a 3D fiber deposition (3DF) machine. For this, porous and solid alginate hydrogel scaffolds, with MSCs homogeneously dispersed throughout the construct, were printed and analyzed in vitro for the presence of hypoxia markers, metabolism, survival, and osteogenic differentiation. We demonstrated that porosity promotes oxygenation of MSCs in printed hydrogel scaffolds and supported the viability and osteogenic differentiation of embedded cells. Porous and solid printed constructs were subsequently implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice to analyze tissue formation in relation to hypoxia responses of embedded cells. Implantation of printed grafts resulted in ingrowth of vascularized tissue and significantly enhanced oxygenation of embedded MSCs. In conclusion, the introduction of pores significantly enhances the conductive properties of printed hydrogel constructs and contributes to the functionality of embedded osteogenic progenitors.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

One hundred uterine myoma patients aged 20 to 52 years were examined. Small pelvic Doppler ultrasonography was carried out in all the patients. The reduction of myomatous nodules was estimated after uterine artery embolization. The decrease in uterine myoma sizes was found to be due to the reduction in their vascularization and the occurrence of ischemia with degeneration in the myoma.

Furthermore, cyclic stress conditioning markedly increases cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (2.2-fold) and proliferation rates (21%) versus unconditioned constructs. Addition of endothelial cells enhances cardiomyocyte proliferation under all stress conditions (14% to 19%), and addition of stromal supporting cells enhances formation of vessel-like structures by \u224810-fold. Furthermore, these optimized human cardiac tissue constructs generate Starling curves, increasing their active force in response to increased resting length. When transplanted onto hearts of athymic rats, the human myocardium survives and forms grafts closely apposed to host myocardium. The grafts contain human microvessels that are perfused by the host coronary circulation.\nOur results indicate that both mechanical load and vascular cell coculture control cardiomyocyte proliferation, and that mechanical load further controls the hypertrophy and architecture of engineered human myocardium.

A new field of research is now developed in order to show their role on fetal membranes constituted by amnion and chorion. To describe the role of retinoids on these membranes, our studies were focused on target gene research. Firstly, all metabolism enzymes needed to vitamin A pathways were demonstrated to be present and active in signal transduction. Secondly, a bioinformatic analysis was performed to assess a list of potential target genes that could be classified in different biological pathways (inflammation, retinoids, hormones, vascularization, extracellular matrix and water homeostasis). Then, it was demonstrated that the gene coding for PLAT, implied in the degradation of extracellular matrix during programmed or premature rupture of membranes, is regulated by retinoids in a two steps mechanism. Finally, preliminary data showed that some aquaporins, which control water transport across membranes, are expressed and regulated by retinoids in the fetal membranes. A disregulation in pathologies like oligo or poly-hydramnios can be anticipated.

Constitutive over-expression of DDAH1, the isoform primarily associated with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) results in increased tumour growth and vascularization, and elevated VEGF secretion. To address whether DDAH1-mediated tumour growth is reliant upon the enzymatic activity of DDAH1, cell lines expressing an active site mutant of DDAH1 incapable of metabolizing ADMA were created. Xenografts derived from these cell lines grew significantly faster than those derived from control cells, yet not as fast as those over-expressing wild-type DDAH1. VEGF expression in DDAH1 mutant-expressing tumours did not differ from control tumours but was significantly lower than that of wild-type DDAH1-over-expressing tumours. Fluorescence microscopy for CD31 and pimonidazole adduct formation demonstrated that DDAH1 mutant-expressing tumours had a lower endothelial content and demonstrated less hypoxia, respectively, than wild-type DDAH1-expressing tumours. However, there was no difference in uptake of the perfusion marker Hoechst 33342. Non-invasive multiparametric quantitative MRI, including the measurement of native T(1) and T(2) relaxation times and apparent water diffusion coefficient, was indicative of higher cellularity in DDAH1-expressing xenografts, which was confirmed by histological quantification of necrosis. C6 xenografts expressing active site mutant DDAH1 displayed an intermediate phenotype between tumours over-expressing wild-type DDAH1 and control tumours. These data suggest that enhanced VEGF expression downstream of DDAH1 was dependent upon ADMA metabolism, but that the DDAH1-mediated increase in tumour growth was only partially dependent upon its enzymatic activity, and therefore must involve an as-yet unidentified mechanism. DDAH1 is an important mediator of tumour progression, but appears to have addition roles independent of its metabolism of ADMA, which need to be considered in therapeutic strategies targeted against the NO/DDAH pathway in cancer.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2011-05-19", "authors": ["Jessica KrBoult", "SimonWalker-Samuel", "YannJamin", "James MLeiper", "Guy St JWhitley", "Simon PRobinson"], "doi": "10.1002/path.2904"}

Compounds that inhibit angiogenesis represent potential therapeutics for many diseases. Karagiannis and Popel [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105(37):13775-13780, 2008] used a bioinformatics approach to identify more than 100 peptides with sequence homology to known angiogenesis inhibitors. The peptides could be grouped into families by the conserved domain of the proteins they were derived from. The families included type IV collagen fibrils, CXC chemokine ligands, and type I thrombospondin domain-containing proteins. The relationships between these families have received relatively little attention. To investigate these relationships, we approached the problem by placing the families of proteins in the context of the human interactome including >120,000 physical interactions among proteins, genes, and transcripts. We built on a graph theoretic approach to identify proteins that may represent conduits of crosstalk between protein families. We validated these findings by statistical analysis and analysis of a time series gene expression data set taken during angiogenesis. We identified six proteins at the center of the angiogenesis-associated network including three syndecans, MMP9, CD44, and versican.

{"title": "The Nyhus-Wantz lectureship: etiology, herniosis, diverticulosis coli, and cancer.", "abstract": "The Nyhus-Wantz Lectureship honors two giants who represent the few who formed a new surgical specialty: herniology. My topics are etiology, herniosis, diverticulosis coli, and cancer. Hippocrates blamed wear and tear for herniation. Russell's (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) explanation was congenital peritoneal \"buds\" extending down to the pelvis. Harrison (Arch Surg 4:680-689, 1922) attributed herniae to transversalis fascial degradation. Keith (Lancet 2(17):1398-1399, 1906) concluded that pathology was involved, even though Russell (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) had denied it. Nevertheless, the congenital theory prevailed. According to McVay (Christopher's textbook of surgery, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1960, p. 159), defects arise in normal musculo-aponeurotic structures. Research showed that atrophy was caused by damaged fibroblasts producing less collagen, which was abnormal (having a reduced I/III ratio). The disease was systemic, later named herniosis. Nicotine addiction increased the incidence of herniation by an inflammatory process named metastatic emphysema. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced. This association occurred eight times more often than expected, with herniosis appearing to be its cause, abetted by high blood cholesterol causing gallstones. In 2006, Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) provided evidence that colon cancer is accompanied by a reduction in diverticula. Klinge et al. (Hernia 8(4):300-301, 2004) showed that these entities require different extracellular matrices (ECMs). Ghajar and Bissell (Histochem Cell Biol 130:1105-1118, 2008) pointed out that the ECM, which comprises 80% of the breast, influences its epithelial genetic expression, likewise with other organs (kidney, skin, lung, colon, and ovaries). Recently, a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer growth and metastasis has taken place. Whereas the degradation of connective tissue was thought to encourage invasion, eliciting concern for the herniated, now, investigators report the reverse, a reactive vascularized stroma resembling wound healing with an increase in fibroblasts and collagen I. Words such as desmoplasia, fibrosis, and stiffening abound. In conclusion, degradation of the ECM may be why herniosis appears to be hostile to the development of cancer throughout the body. Studies are needed of patients with and without a history of hernia to determine their incidence of cancer.

However, it is not clear whether dental pulp cells can be recruited endogenously for regenerating pulp tissues, including mineralizing into dentin. This work is based on a hypothesis that dental pulp stem/progenitor cells can be induced to migrate by chemotactic cytokines and act as endogenous cell sources for regeneration and mineralization. Dental stem cells (DSCs) were isolated from adult human tooth pulp and seeded on the surfaces of 3D collagen gel cylinders that were incubated in chemically defined media with stromal-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7). Significantly more cells were recruited into collagen gel by SDF1 or bFGF than without cytokines in 7 days, whereas BMP7 had little effect on cell recruitment. BMP7, however, was highly effective, equally to dexamethasone, in orchestrating mineralization of cultured DSCs. Cell membrane receptors for SDF1, bFGF, and BMP7 were up-regulated in treated DSCs. Upon in vivo delivery, bFGF induced re-cellularization and re-vascularization in endodontically treated human teeth implanted into the dorsum of rats. Thus, endogenous dental pulp cells, including stem/progenitor cells, may be recruited and subsequently differentiated by chemotaxis of selective cytokines in the regeneration of dental pulp.", "journal": "Journal of dental research", "date": "2011-05-19", "authors": ["TSuzuki", "C HLee", "MChen", "WZhao", "S YFu", "J JQi", "GChotkowski", "S BEisig", "AWong", "J JMao"], "doi": "10.1177/0022034511408426"}
{"title": "Craniopharyngioma: a pathologic, clinical, and surgical review.", "abstract": "Craniopharyngioma is a rare and mostly benign epithelial tumor of the sellar and suprasellar region. Two principal patterns of craniopharyngioma are recognized: papillary and adamantinomatous. Papillary craniopharyngiomas are encountered in adults and may lack the cystic spaces filled with \"motor oil\" as well as the palisading peripheral rows of epithelial cells, keratinization, or calcification typical of pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. Secondary to their anatomic location, craniopharyngiomas may present with endocrinologic dysfunction and visual disturbances. Differential diagnosis includes Rathke's cleft cyst, pituitary adenoma, dermoid/epidermoid cysts, and other rare sellar/suprasellar lesions as pituicytomas. Many controversies exist concerning the preferred surgical approach for these tumors. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is no longer reserved only for sellar or small cystic suprasellar lesions. Prechiasmatic/preinfundibular lesions are effectively removed using an endonasal transtuberculum/transplanum approach; subchiasmatic/transinfundibular tumors require the addition of a transellar approach with inferior pituitary transposition; and retrochiasmatic/retroinfundibular lesions are better accessed performing an endonasal superior pituitary transposition. Compared with well-established trancranial approaches (pterional, subfrontal, presigmoid), endoscopic endonasal surgery combines the virtues of the caudocranial and midline approaches, allowing for appropriate infrachiasmatic exposure without the need for manipulation of surrounding neurovascular structures to access the tumor. This anatomic advantage, combined with high-definition wide-angle visualization, exquisite endonasal microsurgical techniques, and devoted instrumentation facilitates a high rate of endocrine function preservation and visual improvement, while concurrently achieving comparable resections. Endoscopic skull base reconstruction with the vascularized nasoseptal flap has dramatically reduced the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak, consolidating endoscopic endonasal surgery as an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of these challenging tumors.", "journal": "Head & neck", "date": "2011-05-18", "authors": ["Juan CFernandez-Miranda", "Paul AGardner", "Carl HSnyderman", "Kenneth ODevaney", "Primo\u017eStrojan", "CarlosSu\u00e1rez", "Eric MGenden", "AlessandraRinaldo", "AlfioFerlito"], "doi": "10.1002/hed.21771"}

Cellular binding was analyzed, after 2 h of incubation, in tumor spheroids composed of BT474 breast cancer cells, which highly express HER2. Binding was, due to the binding-site barrier, limited to the outer 15 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m rim of the spheroids, independent of affinity when the concentration of the substances was low. When the concentration was high, the binding site barrier was overcome and the binding occurred approximately 35 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m into the spheroids for the two high affinity substances and 50 \u00b1 5 \u00b5m for the low affinity substance.

We found that angiogenic sprouts from the dorsal aorta are dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegf-A) signalling, and do not respond to bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signals. In contrast, sprouts from the axial vein are regulated by Bmp signalling independently of Vegf-A signals, indicating that Bmp is a vein-specific angiogenic cue during early vascular development.

Recent studies however suggest that macrophages may be dispensable for the initiation of angiogenesis in tumors. Rather, these cells express proangiogenic programs that enhance the complexity of the tumor-associated vasculature, leading to aberrant, plethoric and dysfunctional angiogenesis. Gene expression and cell depletion studies further indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprise phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets. This may reflect \"education\" of the macrophage phenotype by signals in some areas of the tumor microenvironment and/or TAM subsets derived from distinct macrophage precursors. Among the better characterized TAM subsets are the proangiogenic (TIE2(+)) and the angiostatic/inflammatory (CD11c(+)) macrophages, which coexist in tumors. Such antagonizing TAM subsets occupy distinct niches in the tumor microenvironment and are present at ratios that vary according to the tumor type and grade. Specifically targeting TAMs or reprogramming them from a proangiogenic to an angiostatic function may \"normalize\" the tumor vasculature and improve the efficacy of various anticancer therapies, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and vascular-disrupting agents.", "journal": "Molecular aspects of medicine", "date": "2011-05-14", "authors": ["Mario LeonardoSquadrito", "MicheleDe Palma"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mam.2011.04.005"}
{"title": "Integration between a percutaneous implant and the porcine small bowel.", "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer or trauma may require removal of all or part of the intestines, leaving the patient with a need to wear external stoma appliances for collection of bowel contents. By connecting the small bowel to a percutaneous port, equipped with a sealing lid, a fully continent and leak proof stoma can be created without a need for permanently wearing stoma appliance. The prerequisites for a connection between a permanent, transabdominal implant and a visceral organ are largely unexplored. Stoma ports made of titanium were implanted in the abdominal wall of domestic pigs and a branch of distal ileum was inserted through the ports. After being followed for 1-3 weeks, the ports were removed and subjected to histological evaluation to study the influence of their shape, structure, and position on the tissue response. Particular focus was attended to the attachment of the ileal serosal surface to the implants inner structure consisting of a titanium mesh. Macroscopic examination revealed fistulas and formation of abscesses in 4 of 11 the retrieved implants. Histological examination revealed regenerated and well-vascularized collagenous tissue around the mesh structure inside the implant. The integration was complete or partial for 10 of 11 ports. Despite various degrees of inflammation and tissue ingrowth, it was demonstrated for the first time that the serosal surface of ileum was firmly attached to the internal structure of the implant.

Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a proangiogenic factor in mammalian tissues and in tumors; therefore, Hsp90 inhibitors were developed as antiangiogenic factors. In this study, we evaluated the association between Hsp90, hypoxia, and angiogenesis in the chick growth plate. Administration of the Hsp90 inhibitor to TD- and rickets-afflicted chicks at the time of induction resulted in reduction in growth-plate size and, contrary to its antiangiogenic effect in tumors, a major invasion of blood vessels occurred in the growth plates. This was the result of upregulation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1, the major rate-limiting factor of vascularization in TD and rickets. In addition, the abnormal chondrocyte differentiation, as characterized by collagen type II expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, and the changes in hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in both disorders were restored. All these changes resulted in prevention of lameness. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity reduced growth-plate size, increased vascularization, and mitigated lameness also in TD chicks with established lesions. In summary, this is the first reported demonstration of involvement of Hsp90 in chondrocyte differentiation and growth-plate vascularization. In contrast to the antiangiogenic effect of Hsp90 inhibitors observed in mammals, inhibition of Hsp90 activity in the unvascularized TD- and rickets-afflicted chicks resulted in activation of the angiogenic switch and reinstated normal growth-plate morphology.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Maternal malnutrition programs the endocrine pancreas in progeny.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes arises when the endocrine pancreas fails to secrete sufficient insulin to cope with metabolic demands resulting from \u03b2 cell secretory dysfunction, decreased \u03b2 cell mass, or both. Epidemiologic studies have shown strong relations between poor fetal and early postnatal nutrition and susceptibility to diabetes later in life. Animal models have been established, and studies have shown that a reduction in the availability of nutrients during fetal development programs the endocrine pancreas and insulin-sensitive tissues. We investigated several modes of early malnutrition in rats. Regardless of the type of diet investigated, whether there was a deficit in calories or protein in food or even in the presence of a high-fat diet, malnourished pups were born with a defect in their \u03b2 cell population, with fewer \u03b2 cells that did not secrete enough insulin and that were more vulnerable to oxidative stress; such populations of \u03b2 cells will never completely recover. Despite the similar endpoint, the cellular and physiologic mechanisms that contribute to alterations in \u03b2 cell mass differ depending on the nature of the nutritional insult. Hormones that are operative during fetal life, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and glucocorticoids; specific molecules, such as taurine; and islet vascularization have been implicated as possible factors in amplifying this defect.

We therefore performed a new reconstruction technique, using a reverse latissimus dorsi muscle flap fed by perforating branches of only the 10th intercostal artery.\nA 45-year-old man had a large traumatic defect located on the hip with exposure of the iliac crest. After confirming and preserving perforating branches of the 10th intercostal artery, the latissimus dorsi muscle flap was turned over just proximal to the perforating branch, and a split-thickness skin graft was performed over the flap.\nThe skin graft took place well and there were no circulation problems.\nThis flap covered a larger area on the hip than the musculocutaneous flap. Furthermore, this is easier to perform and is less invasive than a vascularized free flap. Skin and soft tissue defects that expose bones of the lumbar or hip region can be reconstructed with a local flap; however, the deficit is small for this coverage and usually there is little skin and soft tissue to cover the wound defect in the surrounding area. Thus, it is often difficult to deal with large defects. We performed a reconstruction, using a reverse latissimus dorsi flap fed by perforating branches of the 10th intercostal artery for a large skin and soft tissue defect of the hip with exposure of the iliac crest, resulting in a good outcome.

Cases were analyzed for defect characteristics, flap type, vessel selection, radiation status, dural exposure, complications, and outcomes.\nA total of 68 free flap reconstructions were performed in 65 patients with scalp or LTB defects. A total of 22 resections included craniotomy, and 48 patients had preoperative or postoperative radiation. Defects ranged from 6 to 836 cm(2). All flaps (46 latissimus, 11 rectus, 4 radial forearm, 6 anterolateral thigh, and 1 omental) were transferred successfully. Vein grafts were required in 5 cases. Complications included delayed flap failure requiring secondary reconstruction, neck hematoma, venous thrombosis, skull base infection, large wound dehiscence, small wound dehiscence, donor site hematoma and seroma, and cerebrospinal fluid leak.

Two different transposition pathways, infratemporal transpterygoid and subfrontal, have been proposed for regional flaps. The objective of this study was to describe and assess the feasibility of the transposition of a vascularized pedicled flap from the occipital galeopericranium via the prevertebral space corridor into the nasopharynx.\nTen heads were injected with colored silicone. An endoscopic endonasal anterior craniofacial resection and panclival approach were performed in each specimen. The occipital flap was harvested using a previously described technique. The prevertebral corridor, extending from the neck to the nasopharynx, was dissected superficial to the paraspinal muscles. Computed tomography-based image guidance was used to assess the relationship between the corridor and adjacent neurovascular structures. Length of the corridor and pedicle and area of the donor flap were measured.\nThe flap was harvested and successfully transposed into the nasopharynx using the proposed corridor in all studied specimens (10 heads, 20 sides). All flaps provided complete coverage of the skull base defects. The average length of the pedicle was 70.5 (SD, 6.5) mm, and the average length and width of the flap were 99.9 (SD, 14.6) mm and 59.3 (SD, 10.9) mm, respectively. The average length of the prevertebral corridor was 49.7 (SD, 4.8) mm.\nThe occipital flap has favorable anatomic characteristics for use in skull base reconstruction.

{"title": "Treatment of the severely infected frontal sinus with latissimus dorsi myocutaneous free flaps.", "abstract": "In trauma patients with severe intracranial hemorrhaging, diagnosing facial bone fractures can be delayed. In frontal sinus fractures with nasofrontal duct obstruction, obliteration of the nasofrontal duct and the sinus is the current treatment of choice. But with inadequate management, ascending infections happen, and widely spread infections can involve the entire frontal soft tissues, which result in meningitis, encephalitis, and subcutaneous abscess pockets creating skin defects. In the treatment of these infections, radical debridement of all infected tissues including galea, pericranium, and surrounding soft tissues is obligatory; hence, available local vascularized flap options for obliteration of the postdebridement defect are scarce. In these situations, free-tissue transfer can be a treatment option. Although there have been numerous reports of using nonvascularized materials for obliteration of the frontal sinus, the material itself can serve as a nidus for infection, and it is generally accepted that well-vascularized tissues have greater ability to withstand local soft-tissue infection and osteomyelitis. Hence, we report 3 cases where we performed latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps for severe frontal sinus infections after frontal cranioplasty for severe hemorrhaging. Large bulks of muscle obliterated the nasofrontal duct and the dead space surrounding the entire frontal sinus. The latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap is not a permanent solution for frontal sinus reconstruction, which requires a secondary bony reconstruction.

In this study, a cranial base defect refers to exposed intracranial contents to the skin, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, oropharynx, or oral cavity. These defects resulted from resections of primary or recurrent neoplasms or from secondary problems after cranial base surgery. We performed 20 flaps in 20 patients.

{"title": "A perfusion-independent role of blood vessels in determining branching stereotypy of lung airways.", "abstract": "Blood vessels have been shown to play perfusion-independent roles in organogenesis. Here, we examined whether blood vessels determine branching stereotypy of the mouse lung airways in which coordinated branching of epithelial and vascular tubes culminates in their co-alignment. Using different ablative strategies to eliminate the lung vasculature, both in vivo and in lung explants, we show that proximity to the vasculature is indeed essential for patterning airway branching. Remarkably, although epithelial branching per se proceeded at a nearly normal rate, branching stereotypy was dramatically perturbed following vascular ablation. Specifically, branching events requiring a rotation to change the branching plane were selectively affected. This was evidenced by either the complete absence or the shallow angle of their projections, with both events contributing to an overall flat lung morphology. Vascular ablation also led to a high frequency of ectopic branching. Regain of vascularization fully rescued arrested airway branching and restored normal lung size and its three-dimensional architecture. This role of the vasculature is independent of perfusion, flow or blood-borne substances. Inhibition of normal branching resulting from vascular loss could be explained in part by perturbing the unique spatial expression pattern of the key branching mediator FGF10 and by misregulated expression of the branching regulators Shh and sprouty2. Together, these findings uncovered a novel role of the vasculature in organogenesis, namely, determining stereotypy of epithelial branching morphogenesis.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2011-05-12", "authors": ["AlonLazarus", "Pierre MarieDel-Moral", "OhadIlovich", "EyalMishani", "DavidWarburton", "EliKeshet"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.060723"}

The mechanism underlying the p45NF-E2-dependent placental defect and IUGR remains unknown. Here, we show that the placental defect and IUGR of p45NF-E2 (Nfe2) null mouse embryos is unrelated to thrombocytopenia, establishing that embryonic platelets and platelet-released mediators are dispensable for placentation. Rather, p45NF-E2, which was hitherto thought to be specific to hematopoietic cells, is expressed in trophoblast cells, where it is required for normal syncytiotrophoblast formation, placental vascularization and embryonic growth. Expression of p45NF-E2 in labyrinthine trophoblast cells colocalizes with that of Gcm1, a transcription factor crucial for syncytiotrophoblast formation. In the absence of p45NF-E2, the width of syncytiotrophoblast layer 2 and the expression of Gcm1 and Gcm1-dependent genes (Synb and Cebpa) are increased. In vitro, p45NF-E2 deficiency results in spontaneous syncytiotrophoblast formation, which can be reversed by Gcm1 knockdown. Increased Gcm1 expression in the absence of p45NF-E2 is dependent on enhanced protein acetylation, including post-translational modification of Gcm1. Increasing and inhibiting acetylation in the placenta of wild-type control embryos phenocopies and corrects, respectively, the changes observed in p45NF-E2-deficient embryos.

Both gastric and colonic replacement conduits carry significant morbidity. As emerging organ-sparring techniques become established for early stage esophageal tumors, less morbid reconstruction techniques are warranted. We present two novel endoscopic approaches for esophageal lengthening and reconstruction in a porcine model.\nTwo models of esophageal defects were created in pigs (30-35\u00a0kg) under general anesthesia and subsequently reconstructed with the novel techniques. The first model was a segmental defect of the esophagus created by thoracoscopically transecting the esophagus above the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The first reconstruction technique involved bilateral submucosal endoscopic lengthening myotomies (BSELM) with a magnetic compression anastomosis (MAGNAMOSIS\u2122). The second model was a wedge defect in the anterior esophagus created above the GE junction through a laparotomy. The second reconstruction technique involved an inverted mucosal-submucosal sleeve transposition graft (IMSTG) that crossed the esophageal gap and was secured in place with a self-expandable covered esophageal stent.\nBoth techniques were feasible in the pig model. The BSELM approach lengthened the esophagus 1\u00a0cm for every 2\u00a0cm length of myotomy. The myotomy targeted only the inner circular fibers of the esophagus, with preservation of the longitudinal layer to protect against long-term dilation and pouching. The IMSTG approach generated a vascularized mucosal graft almost as long as the esophagus itself.\nEmerging endoscopic capabilities are enabling complex endoluminal esophageal procedures.

These engineered ES cells were used to derive the Gt(ROSA)26Sor(tm1(SRF-VP16)Antu) mouse strain. Semiquantitative real-time PCR was used to determine expression of the SRF-VP16 transgene at the mRNA level, both in young (P20 and P30) and adult (six months old) Gt(ROSA)26Sor(tm1(SRF-VP16)Antu) mice. We also investigated the transcript levels of endogenous Srf and several SRF target genes. Retinal function was tested by electroretinography in both young and adult mice. Morphological abnormalities could be visualized by hematoxylin and eosin staining of sectioned, paraffin-embedded eye tissue samples.

Additionally, mislamination of retinal cell layers and cellular rosette formations are found in retinas of both heterozygous and homozygous animals of young age. In homozygous individuals, however, the cellular rosettes are more widespread over the fundus. At adult age, retinas both from animals that are heterozygous and homozygous for the floxSTOP/SRF-VP16 transgene display severe degeneration, mainly of the photoreceptor cell layer. Wild-type age-matched littermates, however, do not show any degeneration. The severity of the observed effects correlates with dosage of the transgene.\nThis is the first report suggesting an influence of the transcription factor SRF on the development and function of the murine retina. Ectopic SRF-VP16 mRNA expression in the retinas of young animals is correlated with photoreceptor layer mislamination and impaired retinal function. At an advanced age of six months, degenerative processes are detected in SRF-VP16 transgenic retinas accompanied by impaired retinal function. The Gt(ROSA)26Sor(tm1(SRF-VP16)Antu) mouse strain represents a genetic SRF gain-of-function mouse model that will complement the current SRF loss-of-function models. It promises to provide new insight into the hitherto poorly defined role of SRF in retinal development and function, including potential contributions to ophthalmologic disorders. Furthermore, using conditional Cre-mediated activation of SRF-VP16, the described mouse strain will enable assessment of the impact of dysregulated SRF activity on the physiologic functions of various other organs.", "journal": "Molecular vision", "date": "2011-05-10", "authors": ["JennySandstr\u00f6m", "PeterHeiduschka", "Susanne CBeck", "UlrikePhilippar", "Matthias WSeeliger", "UlrichSchraermeyer", "AlfredNordheim"], "doi": null}

Pregnant ewes were individually given daily oral supplements of 500 mg of alpha-tocopherol (aT; N=6), 1000 mg of gamma-tocopherol (gT; N=7), or placebo (CON; N=5) from 107 to 137 d post breeding. Serum and tissue samples were collected weekly and at the end of the study, respectively. At the end of the study, in the aT, gT and CON groups, serum concentrations were 251.7 \u00b1 12.3, 232.5 \u00b1 6.8, and 285.8 \u00b1 9.4 \u03b7g/\u03bcL, respectively, for isoprostane, and were 341.7 \u00b1 9.3, 358.7 \u00b1 11.5, and 305.2 \u00b1 2.8 \u03b7g/\u03bcL for adiponectin (significantly different for aT and gT versus CON). The mRNA abundance for PPAR\u03b3 in the cotyledon and caruncle were similar in aT and gT ewes. The PPAR\u03b3, ADIPQ and LEP mRNA expressions were reduced (P < 0.05) in the cotyledon and caruncle in aT versus CON ewes. However, associations of PPAR\u03b3 mRNA expression with ADIPQ and LEP mRNA expressions were negatively related in cotyledons, positively related in the caruncle, and positively downregulated in the uterus in gT supplemented ewes accounting for CON. The IGF-1 mRNA expression was downregulated in the cotyledon, caruncle and uterus in aT supplemented ewes. Expression of IGF-2 mRNA was upregulated in the cotyledon and caruncle, and downregulated in the uterus in gT supplemented ewes. In conclusion, oral supplementation of tocopherol during late gestation in ewes decreased isoprostane concentrations and increased adiponectin concentrations in the serum, and significantly affected PPAR\u03b3- and ADIPQ-related genes in the utero-placental network.

{"title": "Gastric ulcerogenic and healing impairment actions of alendronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate - prophylactic effects of rebamipide.", "abstract": "Alendronate, a nitrogen containing bisphosphonate (BPP), when given p.o., decreases the transmucosal potential difference by direct irritating action, resulting in non-hemorrhagic lesions in both the corpus and antrum of fasted rats, and after re-feeding produces large ulcers in the antrum with increased vascular permeability and submucosal edema. The pathogenesis of these ulcers may be explained by the impairment of the mucosal anti-oxidative system and does not involve acid digestion as well as a deficiency of prostaglandins (PGs). Alendronate, although does not affect cyclooxygenase/ PGE(2) production in the ulcerated mucosa, but impairs the healing of gastric ulcers in rats, and this effect may be related to the down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), the important growth factors for the vascularization/granulation as well as the suppression of the stimulatory action of epidermal growth factor on the epithelial proliferation/migration. Rebamipide, a mucosal protective and antiulcer drug, does not affect the direct irritating action of alendronate in the gastric mucosa but prevents the alendronate-induced antral ulceration, probably due to anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions. In addition, this agent also antagonizes the healing impairment action of alendronate by counteracting the down-regulation of bFGF expression in the ulcerated mucosa. It is assumed that rebamipide is a promising drug that can be used as a prophylactic against the adverse effects of BPPs in the stomach.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2011-05-10", "authors": ["KojiTakeuchi", "ShinichiKato", "KikukoAmagase"], "doi": "10.2174/138161211796196927"}

In this study, a biomacromolecular layer-by-layer coating process of chitosan/heparin onto a decellularized extracellular bone matrix was designed to accelerate the blood perfusion and re-endothelialization process. The results of in vitro measurements of the activated partial thromboplastin time supported the theory that the combination of chitosan and heparin could bring both anticoagulation and hemocompatibility to the scaffold. A rabbit bone defect model was established for further evaluation of the application of this kind of surface-modified scaffold in vivo. The final results of computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging and histological examination proved that this facile coating approach could significantly promote blood perfusion and re-endothelialization in the early post-transplanted period compared with an acellular bone matrix due to its much-improved anticoagulation property.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The procedure includes introduction of peritoneal fluid via the peritoneal catheter.\nThe catheter is placed through the anterior abdominal wall with its tip positioned in the small pelvis. There are several techniques for catheter placement considered minimally invasive, which, however, may be associated with various complications. These complications can be divided into mechanical (catheter dysfunction, cuff protrusion, hernia, dialysate leaks, visceral perforation) and infectious (early peritonitis, exit site or tunnel infection, surgical wounds). In most cases, such complications are rare and can be successfully managed using conservative therapy; however, in some situations severe complications can endanger the life of the patient. On-time recognition of complications, particularly in patients at risk, is of paramount importance for an effective treatment.

To date, this disorder is thought to stem from deficient retinal vascularization. Intriguingly, functional electrophysiological studies in patients with mild or moderate ROP and in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model in rats reveal central photoreceptor disruption that overlies modest retinal vessel loss; a paucity of retinal vasculature occurs predominantly at the periphery. Given that choroidal circulation is the major source of oxygen and nutrients to the photoreceptors, the authors set out to investigate whether the choroidal vasculature system may be affected in OIR.\nRat models of OIR treating newborn animals with 80% or 50/10% alternated oxygen level for the first two postnatal weeks were used to mimic ROP in humans. Immunohistology staining and vascular corrosion casts were used to investigate the vessel layout of the eye.

This sustained, marked choroidal degeneration is specifically confined to central regions of the retina that present persistent photoreceptor loss and corresponding functional deficits.

Biomechanical forces resulting from blood flow play a key role in these processes. It is well-known that metabolic stimuli, mechanical forces and flow patterns can affect gene expression and remodelling of vascular networks in different ways. For instance, in the sprouting type of angiogenesis related to hypoxia, there is no blood flow in the rising capillary sprout. In contrast, it has been shown that an increase of wall shear stress initiates the splitting type of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle. Otherwise, during development, both sprouting and intussusception act in parallel in building the vascular network, although with differences in spatiotemporal distribution. Thereby, in addition to regulatory molecules, flow dynamics support the patterning and remodelling of the rising vascular tree.

We have previously found the presence of VM in high-grade gliomas. In this study, we aimed to identify VM patterns in gliomas and to explore their clinical significance. Tumor samples as well as their detailed clinical/prognostic data were collected from 101 patients. Vasculogenic mimicry in the glioma samples was determined by dual staining for endothelial marker CD34 and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Tumor samples were also immunohistochemically stained for Ki-67, VEGF, COX-2 and MMP-9. The association between VM and the clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were performed to compare survival times of the patients. Vasculogenic mimicry was present in 13 out of 101 samples. The higher grade gliomas had a higher incidence of VM than that of lower grade gliomas (P = 0.006). Vasculogenic mimicry channels were associated with the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 (P < 0.05). While there was no association between the existence of VM and the sex, age and preoperative epilepsy of the patients, or expression of Ki-67 and VEGF. However, patients with VM-positive gliomas survived a shorter period of time than those with VM negative gliomas (P = 0.027). Interestingly, in high-grade gliomas, the level of microvascular density was lower in VM positive tumors than those VM negative tumors (P = 0.039). Our results suggest that VM channels in gliomas correlate with increasing malignancy and higher aggressiveness, and may provide a complementation to the tumor's blood supply, especially in less vascularized regions, which may aid in the identification of glioma patients with a poorer prognosis.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2011-05-03", "authors": ["Xiao-meiLiu", "Qing-pingZhang", "Yong-gaoMu", "Xiang-henZhang", "KeSai", "Jesse Chung-SeanPang", "Ho-KeungNg", "Zhong-pingChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s11060-011-0578-5\n10.3171/jns.1999.90.1.0072\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65173-5\n10.1002/pros.10048\n10.1016/j.humpath.2007.07.018\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64739-6\n10.1369/jhc.4A6521.2005\n10.1007/s00401-007-0243-4\n10.3171/jns.1995.83.6.1017\n10.1002/path.1520\n10.1002/ijc.1376\n10.1186/bcr1626\n10.1186/bcr1019\n10.3748/wjg.14.2430\n10.1007/DCR.0b013e3181beb4ff\n10.1016/j.humpath.2003.10.022\n10.1038/nrc1092\n10.1038/leu.2009.10\n10.1093/brain/awq044\n10.3171/2010.2.JNS09335\n10.3171/jns.1998.88.3.0513\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960115)77:2<362::AID-CNCR20>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1111/j.1365-2990.2006.00763.x\n10.1038/nature09624"}

In particular, we determine how the domain size, aspect ratio and initial vascular network influence the tumour's growth dynamics and its long-time composition. We establish whether it is possible to extrapolate simulation results obtained for small domains to larger ones, by constructing a large simulation domain from a number of identical subdomains, each subsystem initially comprising two parallel parent vessels, with associated cells and diffusible substances. We find that the subsystem is not representative of the full domain and conclude that, for this initial vessel geometry, interactions between adjacent subsystems contribute to the overall growth dynamics. We then show that extrapolation of results from a small subdomain to a larger domain can only be made if the subdomain is sufficiently large and is initialised with a sufficiently complex vascular network. Motivated by these results, we perform simulations to investigate the tumour's response to therapy and show that the probability of tumour elimination in a larger domain can be extrapolated from simulation results on a smaller domain. Finally, we demonstrate how our model may be combined with experimental data, to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of a vascular tumour.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-05-03", "authors": ["HolgerPerfahl", "Helen MByrne", "TinganChen", "VeronicaEstrella", "Tom\u00e1sAlarc\u00f3n", "AlexeiLapin", "Robert AGatenby", "Robert JGillies", "Mark CLloyd", "Philip KMaini", "MatthiasReuss", "Markus ROwen"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0014790"}

We crossed transgenic mice with whey acidic protein promoter-driven large T-antigen expression (WAP-T mice) with oncogene-induced mammary carcinogenesis with CEACAM1null mice, and with Tie2-Ceacam1 transgenics, in which the Tie2 promoter drives endothelial overexpression of CEACAM1 (WAP-T \u00d7 CEACAM1(endo+) mice), and analyzed tumor vascularization, angiogenesis and vessel maturation in these mice. Using flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT) and histology, we found that WAP-T \u00d7 CEACAM1(endo+) mice exhibited enhanced tumoral vascularization owing to CEACAM1(+) vessels in the tumor periphery, and increased intratumoral angiogenesis compared with controls. In contrast, vascularization of CEACAM1null/WAP-T-derived tumors was poor, and tumor vessels were dilated, leaky and showed poor pericyte coverage. Consequently, the tumoral vasculature could not be visualized in CEACAM1null/WAP-T mice by fpVCT, and we observed poor organization of the perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM), accompanied by the accumulation of collagen IV-degrading matrix metalloproteinase 9(+) (MMP9(+)) leukocytes and stromal cells. Vascular instability and alterations in ECM structure were accompanied by a significant increase in pulmonary metastases in CEACAM1null/WAP-T mice, whereas only occasional metastases were observed in CEACAM1(+) hosts. In CEACAM1(+) hosts, intratumoral vessels did not express CEACAM1, but they were intact, extensively covered with pericytes and framed by a well-organized perivascular ECM. MMP9(+) accessory cells were largely absent. Orthotopic transplantation of primary WAP-T- and CEACAM1null/WAP-T tumors into all three mouse lines confirmed that a CEACAM1(+) host environment is a prerequisite for productive angiogenic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Hence, CEACAM1 expression in the tumor periphery determines the vascular phenotype in a tumor, whereas systemic absence of CEACAM1 interferes with the formation of an organized tumor matrix and intratumoral vessel maturation.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-05-03", "authors": ["DGerstel", "FWegwitz", "KJannasch", "PLudewig", "KScheike", "FAlves", "NBeauchemin", "WDeppert", "CWagener", "A KHorst"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.146"}

The advent of facial allotransplantation has allowed optimal anatomical reconstruction to be achieved; however, the need for lifelong immunosuppression and unpredictable functional outcomes preclude it from routine acceptance in clinical practice. Evidence from published reports on the first four face transplant recipients indicates improved and accelerated return of sensation to the facial allograft despite suboptimal repair of the sensory nerves.\nThe authors performed a comparative analysis of the sensory outcomes following face transplantation with the sensory recovery achieved after conventional nerve repair, autologous face and scalp replantation, and vascularized free tissue transfer.\nSensory recovery following face transplantation, even when the sensory nerves were not repaired, was comparable to the outcome of microsurgical repair of the peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve and innervated free flaps.\nNearly normal sensory recovery can be expected following facial allotransplantation with or without repair of the sensory nerves. The mechanisms responsible for this surprising outcome include preservation of normal density of the receptors within the facial allograft, regeneration from the recipient bed and allograft margins, transmission of the sensory inputs through afferent fibers contained in the facial nerve, nervi nervorum of the facial nerve, or trigeminofacial communicating rami. Furthermore, immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus contributes to the accelerated nerve regeneration.

After 2 weeks, cocultures in EGM2 formed more microvessel-like structures compared to cocultures in ODM as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining for the endothelial marker CD31. Increased expression of CD31 and CD146 in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction as well as a higher percentage of CD31- and CD146-positive cells in flow cytometry indicated a beneficial influence of EGM2 on endothelial cell growth and function.

Here an alternative augmentation technique using a new technique of vascularized bone transfer is described.\nIn five patients with clefts of the lip, palate, and alveolus (four unilateral, one bilateral) there was a severe defect of the anterior maxillary alveolar ridge after tooth loss. The patients previously had augmentative surgery one to three times without success. The defect was covered using a microvascular corticocancellous transplant from the medial distal femur. The defects to be corrected measured 2.5 to 4.0 cm long, 1.0 to 1.5 cm wide, and 1 to 1.5 cm high. The microvascular pedicle of the femur bone flap was 3 to 7 cm long. The descending genicular artery was anastomosed to the facial or labial superior artery and the accompanying veins accordingly. In every case, the anastomoses were performed via an intraoral transmucosal approach.\nThere were no serious complications and no flap loss. In all patients the defect was covered by a flap of the correct size and design. All patients were treated with dental implants (13 total) 6 months after successful reconstruction of the ridge. The implants were loaded 4 to 6 months after placement with fixed superstructures.

{"title": "Surgical nuances for removal of olfactory groove meningiomas using the endoscopic endonasal transcribriform approach.", "abstract": "Olfactory groove meningiomas represent 10% of intracranial meningiomas and arise in the midline of the anterior cranial fossa along the dura of the cribriform plate and planum sphenoidale. Hyperostosis of the adjacent underlying bone is common, and further extension into ethmoid sinuses and nasal cavity can occur in 15%-25% of cases. Radical tumor resection including the involved dural attachment and underlying hyperostotic bone offers the best chance of a Simpson Grade I resection to minimize recurrence. Incomplete removal of involved hyperostotic bone can result in tumor recurrence at the cribriform plate with extension into the paranasal sinuses. Resection has traditionally been performed using a bifrontal or pterional approach, both of which require some degree of brain retraction or manipulation to expose the tumor. The endoscopic endonasal transcribriform approach offers the most direct and immediate exposure to the tumor without brain retraction and manipulation of neurovascular structures. An endonasal \"keyhole craniectomy\" is performed in the ventral skull base directly over the basal dural attachment, extending from the posterior wall of the frontal sinus to the planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sellae in the anteroposterior plane, and from one medial orbit to the other in the coronal plane. Excellent panoramic visualization of the keyhole skull base defect can be obtained with a 30\u00b0 endoscope after performing a modified Lothrop procedure. Because the dural attachment is adjacent to the paranasal sinuses, early devascularization and total Simpson Grade I removal of the tumor including the dural attachment and underlying hyperostotic bone can be achieved in properly selected patients. This approach is also very suitable for meningiomas that have recurred or extended into the paranasal sinuses. Extracapsular, extraarachnoid dissection of the tumor from the frontal lobes and neurovascular structures can be performed using conventional bimanual microsurgical techniques. In this report, we review the surgical technique and describe our operative nuances for removal of olfactory groove meningiomas, including recurrent tumors with extension into the nasal cavity, using a purely endoscopic endonasal transcribriform approach. In addition, we discuss the advantages, limitations, patient selection, and complications of this approach.

Radical tumor resection including the involved dural attachment, underlying hyperostotic bone, and intracanalicular tumor in the optic canal offers the best chance of a Simpson Grade I resection to minimize recurrence. Decompression of the optic canal with removal of the intracanalicular tumor also improves visual outcome since this portion of the tumor is usually the cause of asymmetrical visual loss. The purely endoscopic endonasal extended transsphenoidal approach offers a direct midline trajectory and immediate access to tuberculum sellae meningiomas without brain retraction and manipulation of neurovascular structures. Although the endoscopic approach has been previously criticized for its inability to remove tumor within the optic canals, complete Simpson Grade I tumor removal including intracanalicular tumor, dural attachment, and involved hyperostotic bone can be achieved in properly selected patients. Excellent visualization of the suprasellar region and the inferomedial aspects of both optic canals allows for extracapsular, extraarachnoid dissection of the tumor from the critical structures using bimanual microsurgical dissection.

{"title": "Gradients with depth in electrospun fibrous scaffolds for directed cell behavior.", "abstract": "A major obstacle in creating viable tissue-engineered constructs using electrospinning is the lack of complete cellularization and vascularization due to the limited porosity in these densely packed fibrous scaffolds. One potential approach to circumvent this issue is the use of various gradients of chemical and biophysical cues to drive the infiltration of cells into these structures. Toward this goal, this study focused on creating durotactic (mechanical) and haptotactic (adhesive) gradients through the thickness of electrospun hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffolds using a unique, yet simple, modification of common electrospinning protocols. Specifically, both mechanical (via cross-linking: ranging from 27-100% modified methacrylated HA, MeHA) and adhesive (via inclusion of the adhesive peptide RGD: 0-3 mM RGD) gradients were each fabricated by mixing two solutions (one ramping up, one ramping down) prior to electrospinning and fiber collection. Gradient formation was verified by fluorescence microscopy, FTIR, atomic force microscopy, and cellular morphology assessment of scaffolds at different points of collection (i.e., with scaffold thickness). To test further the functionality of gradient scaffolds, chick aortic arch explants were cultured on adhesive gradient scaffolds for 7 days, and low RGD-high RGD gradient scaffolds showed significantly greater cell infiltration compared with high RGD-low RGD gradients and uniform high RGD or uniform low RGD control scaffolds. In addition to enhanced infiltration, this approach could be used to fabricate graded tissue structures, such as those that occur at interfaces.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2011-05-03", "authors": ["Harini GSundararaghavan", "Jason ABurdick"], "doi": "10.1021/bm200415g"}

Are there predictive parameters for intraoperative excessive blood loss despite preoperative embolization?", "abstract": "Preoperative embolization of vertebral metastases has been shown to lower intraoperative blood loss. Nevertheless, excessive up to life-threatening blood loss can occur despite embolization. We therefore decided to evaluate possible parameters for predicting significant blood loss in a surgically homogeneous group of patients with vertebral metastases.\nPatients with vertebral metastases of the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine who underwent preoperative embolization were included. All patients had existing or impending neurological deficit as the main indication for direct metastasis reduction. The parameters evaluated were the technical feasibility of embolization, vascularization grade of metastasis, success of embolization, tumor type in relation to blood loss, and interval between embolization and surgery.\nTwenty-seven patients fullfilled the inclusion criteria. Technically complete embolization was feasible in 14 patients (52%) and fully successful embolization was obtained in 10 patients (37%). Eighty-three percent of the renal cell carcinomas were hypervascularized, but also 67% of the breast carcinoma patients had hypervascularized tumors. No permanent complications occurred during embolization, but two patients had pain and another two experienced a transient burning sensation. A significant difference in intraoperative blood loss was only found between patients achieving partially or fully successful embolization in the subgroup of hypervascularized grade III metastases.\nThe success of embolization in the group of hypervascularized grade III metastases was the only predictor for the extent of blood loss in our study. Due to the inaccuracy of predicting high blood loss in general all possible precautions for excessive blood loss should be taken despite preoperative embolization.

These cells predominantly reside in the bone marrow and are recruited at sites of inflammation, tissue damage and tumors. The tissue-specific factors responsible for recruitment of BM-EPCs and neo-vascularization are the subject of intense investigation. Using bone marrow cells from Tek/green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice, we analyzed the effect of estrogen on the mobilization of BM-EPCs to orthotopically implanted cancer cells in estrogen- and non-estrogen-supplemented ovariectomized mice. The donor marrow cells were unique as they were fluorescently tagged, allowing for the tracking of their migration to the tumor tissues. Results showed that GFP + BM-EPCs were incorporated within the tumor vasculature in comparison to the sham injections. Notably, estrogen supplementation enhanced the mobilization of BM-EPCs to the tumor site. This elevation shows that estrogen may affect tumor neo-vascularization by inducing the mobilization of BM-EPCs.

When injected before gastrulation, hCD34(+) cells cosegregated with the presumptive zebrafish hemangioblasts, characterized by Scl and Gata2 expression, in the anterior and posterior lateral mesoderm and were involved in early development of the embryonic vasculature. These morphogenetic events occurred without apparent lineage reprogramming, as shown by CD45 expression. When transplanted postgastrulation, hCD34(+) cells were recruited into developing vessels, where they exhibited a potent paracrine proangiogenic action. Finally, hCD34(+) cells rescued vascular defects induced by Vegf-c in vivo targeting and enhanced vascular repair in the zebrafish fin amputation model.\nThese results indicate an unexpected developmental ability of human-derived hematopoietic progenitors and support the hypothesis of an evolutionary conservation of molecular pathways involved in endothelial progenitor differentiation in vivo.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2011-04-30", "authors": ["OmbrettaPozzoli", "PietroVella", "GraziaIaffaldano", "ValeriaParente", "PaoloDevanna", "MartaLacovich", "Carla LoraLamia", "UmbertoFascio", "DanielaLongoni", "FrancoCotelli", "Maurizio CCapogrossi", "MaurizioPesce"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.226969"}

Reconstruction of trauma- or mandibular oncologic defects with bony free flaps is considered the gold standard. However the the optimal reconstruction of mandibular defects is still controversial in regards to reconstructive options which include the donor site selection and the timing of surgery.

In the world of cell therapies, undoubtedly, mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue are the most promising progenitors for tissue engineering applications. In this setting, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are generally similar to those derived from bone marrow and are most conveniently extracted from tissue removed by elective cosmetic liposuction procedures; they also show a great potential for endothelization. The aim of the present work was to investigate how the cocommitment into a vascular and bone phenotype of ASCs could be a useful tool for improving the in vitro and in vivo reconstruction of a vascularized bone graft. Human ASCs obtained from abdominoplasty procedures were loaded in a hydroxyapatite clinical-grade scaffold, codifferentiated, and tested for proliferation, cell distribution, and osteogenic and vasculogenic gene expression.

{"title": "Osteopontin controls endothelial cell migration in vitro and in excised human valvular tissue from patients with calcific aortic stenosis and controls.", "abstract": "Calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) is a pathological condition of the aortic valve characterized by dystrophic calcification of the valve leaflets. Despite the high prevalence and mortality associated with CAS, little is known about its pathogenetic mechanisms. Characterized by progressive dystrophic calcification of the valve leaflets, the early stages of aortic valve degeneration are similar to the active inflammatory process of atherosclerosis including endothelial disruption, inflammatory cell infiltration, lipid deposition, neo-vascularization and calcification. In the vascular system, the endothelium is an important regulator of physiological and pathological conditions; however, the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to valvular degeneration at the cellular and molecular level has received little attention. Endothelial cell (EC) activation and neo-vascularization of the cusps characterizes all stages of aortic valvular degeneration from aortic sclerosis to aortic stenosis. Here we reported the role of osteopontin (OPN) in the regulation of EC activation in vitro and in excised tissue from CAS patients and controls. OPN is an important pro-angiogenic factor in several pathologies. High levels of OPN have been demonstrated in both tissue and plasma of patients with aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis. The characterization of valvular ECs as a cellular target for OPN will help us uncover the pathogenesis of aortic valve degeneration and stenosis, opening new perspectives for the prevention and therapy of this prevalent disease.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2011-04-27", "authors": ["PaoloPoggio", "Juan BGrau", "Benjamin CField", "RachanaSainger", "William FSeefried", "FlavioRizzolio", "GiovanniFerrari"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.22549"}

{"title": "Organogenesis of the kidney glomerulus: focus on the glomerular basement membrane.", "abstract": "The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a crucial component of the kidney's filtration barrier that separates the vasculature from the urinary space. During glomerulogenesis, the GBM is formed from fusion of two distinct basement membranes, one synthesized by the glomerular epithelial cell (podocyte) and the other by the glomerular endothelial cell. The main components of the GBM are laminin-521 (\u03b15\u03b22\u03b31), collagen \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15(IV), nidogen and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, agrin. By studying mice lacking specific GBM components, we have shown that during glomerulogenesis, laminin is the only one that is required for GBM integrity and in turn, the GBM is required for completion of glomerulogenesis and glomerular vascularization. In addition, our results from laminin \u03b22-null mice suggest that laminin-521, and thus the GBM, contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier to plasma albumin. In contrast, mutations that affect GBM collagen IV or agrin do not impair glomerular development or cause immediate leakage of plasma proteins. However, collagen IV mutation, which causes Alport syndrome and ESRD in humans, leads to gradual damage to the GBM that eventually leads to albuminuria and renal failure.

{"title": "Distinct contributions of angiogenesis and vascular co-option during the initiation of primary microtumors and micrometastases.", "abstract": "Primary tumors and metastases have been thought to initiate avascularly as multicellular aggregates and later induce angiogenesis or initiate vascularly by co-opting pre-existing host blood vessels without inducing angiogenesis. These two distinct concepts of microtumor vascularization have raised significant controversies. To clarify intratumoral vascularization and tumor cell behaviors at single-cell level during the earliest stage of microtumor initiation, we established primary and metastatic microtumor models in Tg(flk1:EGFP) transgenic zebrafish. We found that tumor cells preferred to initiate avascularly as multicellular aggregates and only later (50-100 cells in size) induced angiogenesis in blood-supply-sufficient microenvironments. In blood-supply-deficient microenvironments, less tumor cells (20-30 cells per fish) managed to co-opt and migrate along host vessels, whereas more tumor cells (100-300 cells per fish) could immediately induce angiogenesis without obvious cell migration. In a metastatic model, we clearly observed that tumor cells co-opted, migrated along and proliferated on the surface of host vessels at an early stage after they extravasated from host vessels and induced angiogenesis later when micromatastases comprised only 15-30 tumor cells. Moreover, the inducement of neovessels accelerated the growth of micromatastases in size, meanwhile, decreased the migration of tumor cells on the surface of host vessels. These results suggest that vessel co-option and angiogenesis have distinct contributions during the initiation of microtumors. Microtumors initiated reasonably through co-opting host vessels or inducing angiogenesis, depending on the differences of local microenvironments and cell numbers in microtumors.

Although tendons clearly differ biologically from ligaments, multiple animal studies have shown that the implanted tendons indeed seem to remodel into a ligamentous \"anterior cruciate ligament-like\" structure.\nThe goal of this study was to systematically review the current literature on the \"ligamentization\" process in human anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.\nSystematic review.\nA computerized search using relevant search terms was performed in the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, as well as a manual search of reference lists. Searches were limited to studies examining the healing of the intra-articular portion of the tendon graft based on biopsies of this graft obtained from a living human.\nFour studies were determined to be appropriate for systematic review, none of them reaching a level of evidence higher than 3. All reports considered autografts. Biopsy specimens were evaluated by light or electron microscopy and analyzed for vascularization, cellular aspects, and appearance of extracellular matrix. All authors universally agreed that the tendon grafts survive in the intra-articular environment. Based on changes observed in the healing grafts with regard to vascularization, cellular aspects, and properties of the extracellular matrix, different chronologic stages in the ligamentization process were discerned.\nThe key finding of this systematic review is that a free tendon graft replacing a ruptured human anterior cruciate ligament undergoes a series of biologic processes termed \"ligamentization.\" The graft seems to remain viable at any time during this course. Histologically, the mature grafts may resemble the normal human anterior cruciate ligament, but ultrastructural differences regarding collagen fibril distribution do persist. Different stages of the ligamentization process are described, but no agreement exists on their time frame.

A cell-matrix composite was constructed by applying fibrin hydrogel with suspended cells onto decellularized sheets of human myocardium. We then implanted this composite onto the infarct bed in a nude rat model of cardiac infarction.

When implanted by composite scaffold, preconditioned MPCs greatly enhanced vascular network formation in the infarct bed by mechanisms involving the secretion of paracrine factors, such as SDF-1, and the migration of MPCs into ischemic myocardium, but not normal myocardium.

{"title": "The tumor suppressor gene Trp53 protects the mouse lens against posterior subcapsular cataracts and the BMP receptor Acvr1 acts as a tumor suppressor in the lens.", "abstract": "We previously found that lenses lacking the Acvr1 gene, which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, had abnormal proliferation and cell death in epithelial and cortical fiber cells. We tested whether the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53) affected this phenotype. Acvr1 conditional knockout (Acvr1(CKO)) mouse fiber cells had increased numbers of nuclei that stained for p53 phosphorylated on serine 15, an indicator of p53 stabilization and activation. Deletion of Trp53 rescued the Acvr1(CKO) cell death phenotype in embryos and reduced Acvr1-dependent apoptosis in postnatal lenses. However, deletion of Trp53 alone increased the number of fiber cells that failed to withdraw from the cell cycle. Trp53(CKO) and Acvr1;Trp53(DCKO) (double conditional knockout), but not Acvr1(CKO), lenses developed abnormal collections of cells at the posterior of the lens that resembled posterior subcapsular cataracts. Cells from human posterior subcapsular cataracts had morphological and molecular characteristics similar to the cells at the posterior of mouse lenses lacking Trp53. In Trp53(CKO) lenses, cells in the posterior plaques did not proliferate but, in Acvr1;Trp53(DCKO) lenses, many cells in the posterior plaques continued to proliferate, eventually forming vascularized tumor-like masses at the posterior of the lens. We conclude that p53 protects the lens against posterior subcapsular cataract formation by suppressing the proliferation of fiber cells and promoting the death of any fiber cells that enter the cell cycle. Acvr1 acts as a tumor suppressor in the lens. Enhancing p53 function in the lens could contribute to the prevention of steroid- and radiation-induced posterior subcapsular cataracts.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2011-04-21", "authors": ["Luke AWiley", "RamyaRajagopal", "Lisa KDattilo", "David CBeebe"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.006593"}

Their origin and function are unknown. During fetal development, blood vessels penetrate deep within the AF and recede during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that cross bridges are the pathways left by these receding blood vessels. Initially, the presence of cross bridges was confirmed in cadaveric human discs aged 25 and 53 years. Next, L1-L2 intervertebral discs (n=4) from sheep ranging in age from 75 days fetal gestation to adult were processed for paraffin histology. Mid-sagittal sections were immunostained for endothelial cell marker PECAM-1. The anterior and posterior AF were imaged using differential interference contrast microscopy, and the following parameters were quantified: total number of distinct lamellae, total number of cross bridges, percentage of cross bridges staining positive for PECAM-1, cross bridge penetration depth (% total lamellae), and PECAM-1 positive cross bridge penetration depth. Cross bridges were first observed at 100 days fetal gestation. The overall number peaked in neonates then remained relatively unchanged. The percentage of PECAM-1 positive cross bridges declined progressively from almost 100% at 100 days gestation to less than 10% in adults. Cross bridge penetration depth peaked in neonates then remained unchanged at subsequent ages. Depth of PECAM-1 positive cross bridges decreased progressively after birth. Findings were similar for both the anterior and posterior. The AF lamellar architecture is established early in development. It later becomes disrupted as a consequence of vascularization. Blood vessels then recede, perhaps due to increasing mechanical stresses in the surrounding matrix.

Cut points optimized to the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to dichotomize MR imaging data for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. MR imaging parameters and known prognostic indicators in primary breast cancer were correlated with disease-free and overall survival by using the Cox proportional hazards model for univariate and multivariate analyses.\nMR imaging was performed before (n = 62) and after (n = 58) two cycles of NAC. The median follow-up time was 43.9 months for disease-free survival and 60.3 months for overall survival. There were 28 recurrences; 26 patients had distant metastases (two had additional local recurrence) and two had local recurrence only. There were 20 deaths, all of which were related to breast cancer. At univariate analysis, progesterone receptor status, the type of surgery performed, higher posttreatment K(trans) (P = .048), and larger posttreatment IAUGC(60) (P = .035) were significant predictors of worse disease-free survival. At multivariate analysis, progesterone receptor status (P = .002) and mean transit time (P = .025) were significant predictors of disease-free survival. Univariate analysis showed that clinical tumor stage (P = .005), progesterone receptor status (P = .025), and type of surgery performed (P = .017) were significant predictors of overall survival. Higher posttreatment K(trans) (P = .043), larger IAUGC(60) (P = .029), and larger tumor size at posttreatment MR imaging were predictive of worse overall survival (P = .018). Of these variables, K(trans) remained an independent indicator of overall survival (P = .038).\nHigher posttreatment tumor vascularization as depicted with dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging may be associated with higher recurrence and lower survival rates. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging parameters, in conjunction with traditional prognostic factors, have the potential to be prognostic biomarkers for disease-free and overall survival in primary breast cancer.", "journal": "Radiology", "date": "2011-04-20", "authors": ["Sonia PLi", "AndreasMakris", "Mark JBeresford", "N JaneTaylor", "Mei-Lin WAh-See", "J JamesStirling", "James Ad'Arcy", "David JCollins", "RobertKozarski", "Anwar RPadhani"], "doi": "10.1148/radiol.11102493"}

There were 23 males and 12 females, aged 21-52 years (mean, 35.2 years), including 8 cases of steroid-induced, 7 cases of traumatic, 6 cases of alcoholic, and 14 cases of idiopathic ONFH. The left side was involved in 15 cases, and right side in 20 cases.

Thirty-five patients were followed up 2-3 years with an average of 2.5 years. At 2 years after operation, the HHS score was 85.8 +/- 4.1, showing significant difference when compared with the preoperative score (t = 23.200, P = 0.000).

Delineating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which aging impairs wound healing may lead to the development of improved treatment strategies for elderly patients with non-healing wounds. Neovascularization is an essential step in wound healing, and bone marrow-derived angiogenic cells (BMDACs) play an important role in vascularization. Using a mouse full-thickness burn wound model, we demonstrate that perfusion and vascularization of burn wounds were impaired by aging and were associated with dramatically reduced mobilization of BMDACs bearing the cell surface molecules CXCR4 and Sca1. Expression of stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), the cytokine ligand for CXCR4, was significantly decreased in peripheral blood and burn wounds of old mice. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 was detected in burn wounds from young (2-month-old), but not old (2-year-old), mice. When BMDACs from young donor mice were injected intravenously, homing to burn wound tissue was impaired in old recipient mice, whereas the age of the BMDAC donor mice had no effect on homing. Our results indicate that aging impairs burn wound vascularization by impairing the mobilization of BMDACs and their homing to burn wound tissue as a result of impaired HIF-1 induction and SDF-1 signaling.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2011-04-19", "authors": ["XianjieZhang", "KakaliSarkar", "SergioRey", "RaulSebastian", "EfstathiaAndrikopoulou", "Guy PMarti", "KarenFox-Talbot", "Gregg LSemenza", "John WHarmon"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-011-0754-2"}

Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are dramatically elevated in cancer patients and tumor bearing mice. MDSCs modulate the tumor microenvironment through attenuating host immune response and increasing vascularization.\nIn searching for molecular mediators responsible for pro-tumor functions, we found that regulator of G protein signaling-2 (Rgs2) is highly increased in tumor-derived MDSCs compared to control MDSCs. We further demonstrate that hypoxia, a common feature associated with solid tumors, upregulates the gene expression. Genetic deletion of Rgs2 in mice resulted in a significant retardation of tumor growth, and the tumors exhibit decreased vascular density and increased cell death. Interestingly, deletion of Rgs2 in MDSCs completely abolished their tumor promoting function, suggesting that Rgs2 signaling in MDSCs is responsible for the tumor promoting function. Cytokine array profiling identified that Rgs2-/- tumor MDSCs produce less MCP-1, leading to decreased angiogenesis, which could be restored with addition of recombinant MCP-1.\nOur data reveal Rgs2 as a critical regulator of the pro-angiogenic function of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment, through regulating MCP-1 production.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-04-16", "authors": ["Kimberly CBoelte", "Laura EGordy", "SebastianJoyce", "Mary AnnThompson", "LiYang", "P CharlesLin"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0018534"}

This experimental investigation introduced and explored the hypothesis that dynamic mechanical loading can pump solutes out of blood vessels and into the surrounding tissue, leading to faster uptake and higher solute concentrations than could otherwise be achieved under unloaded conditions. Immature epiphyseal cartilage was used as a model tissue system, with fluorescein (332 Da), dextran (3, 10, and 70 kDa) and transferrin (80 kDa) as model solutes. Cartilage disks were either dynamically loaded (\u00b1 10% compression over a 10% static offset strain, at 0.2 Hz) or maintained unloaded in solution for up to 20 h. Results demonstrated statistically significant solute uptake in dynamically loaded (DL) explants relative to passive diffusion (PD) controls for all solutes except unbound fluorescein, as evidenced by the DL:PD concentration ratios after 20 h (1.0 \u00b1 0.2, 2.4 \u00b1 1.1, 6.1 \u00b1 3.3, 9.0 \u00b1 4.0, and 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 for fluorescein, 3, 10, and 70 kDa dextran, and transferrin). Significant uptake enhancements were also observed within the first 30s of loading. Termination of dynamic loading produced dissipation of enhanced solute uptake back to PD control values.

The present study evaluates how treatment with liposomal formulation of irinotecan (Irinophore C\u2122), and other liposomal anticancer drugs, influence the tumor vasculature of GBM models grown either orthotopically or subcutaneously.\nLiposomal vincristine (2 mg/kg), doxorubicin (Caelyx\u00ae; 15 mg/kg) and irinotecan (Irinophore C\u2122; 25 mg/kg) were injected intravenously (i.v.; once weekly for 3 weeks) in Rag2M mice bearing U251MG tumors. Tumor blood vessel function was assessed using the marker Hoechst 33342 and by magnetic resonance imaging-measured changes in vascular permeability/flow (Ktrans). Changes in CD31 staining density, basement membrane integrity, pericyte coverage, blood vessel diameter were also assessed.\nThe three liposomal drugs inhibited tumor growth significantly compared to untreated control (p < 0.05-0.001). The effects on the tumor vasculature were determined 7 days following the last drug dose. There was a 2-3 fold increase in the delivery of Hoechst 33342 observed in subcutaneous tumors (p < 0.001). In contrast there was a 5-10 fold lower level of Hoechst 33342 delivery in the orthotopic model (p < 0.01), with the greatest effect observed following treatment with Irinophore C. Following treatment with Irinophore C, there was a significant reduction in Ktrans in the orthotopic tumors (p < 0.05).\nThe results are consistent with a partial restoration of the blood-brain barrier following treatment.

Taken together the results suggest that treatment can lead to normalization of GBM blood vessel the structure and function.

{"title": "Visualisation and stereological assessment of blood and lymphatic vessels.", "abstract": "The physiological processes involved in tissue development and regeneration also include the parallel formation of blood and lymphatic vessel circulations which involves their growth, maturation and remodelling. Both vascular systems are also frequently involved in the development and progression of pathological conditions in tissues and organs. The blood vascular system circulates oxygenated blood and nutrients at appropriate physiological levels for tissue survival, and efficiently removes all waste products including carbon dioxide. This continuous network consists of the heart, aorta, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, post-capillary venules, venules, veins and vena cava. This system exists in an interstitial environment together with the lymphatic vascular system, including lymph nodes, which aids maintenance of body fluid balance and immune surveillance. To understand the process of vascular development, vascular network stability, remodelling and/or regression in any research model under any experimental conditions, it is necessary to clearly and unequivocally identify and quantify all elements of the vascular network. By utilising stereological methods in combination with cellular markers for different vascular cell components, it is possible to estimate parameters such as surface density and surface area of blood vessels, length density and length of blood vessels as well as absolute vascular volume.

Around 35% of patients are diagnosed at stages in which transarterial therapies are indicated as first-line therapy; many others are treated after recurrence or progression to surgery or percutaneous ablation. However, the scientific evidence supporting the use of transarterial therapy is heterogeneous and certainly weak for several subgroups. New developments have emerged in the last decade.\nThis review discusses the scientific evidence supporting the use of transarterial therapies for patients with HCC, including chemoembolization with conventional materials or drug-eluting beads, and internal radiation procedures such as the injection radioactive lipiodol or radioembolization with (90)Y-loaded microspheres. The literature on clinical development of transarterial therapies for HCC has been reviewed since 1990.\nTransarterial chemoembolization has been shown to improve the survival of those patients with unresectable, mostly viral-related HCC who have a preserved liver function and low tumor burden.

CEUS can be used to more accurately determine pancreatic lesions compared to conventional US or to characterize lesions already detectable by US. Thus, CEUS can aid in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Using US contrast media, it is possible to visually detect microvessels in the majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Thus, the use of quantitatively evaluated transabdominal CEUS can help in the differentiation of patients with mass-forming pancreatitis from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors, different enhancement patterns can be observed in relation to the tumor mass: larger ones show a rapid early enhancement sometimes combined with necrotic central structures, and smaller ones disclose a capillary-blush enhancement. Pseudocysts, the most widespread cystic lesions of the pancreas, are not vascularized. They do not show any signal in CEUS and remain entirely anechoic in all phases, while true cystic pancreatic tumors usually have vascularized septa and parietal nodules. In summary, CEUS is effective for differentiating solid pancreatic tumors in most cases. CEUS is safe and cost effective and can better discriminate solid from cystic pancreatic lesions, thereby directing further imaging modalities.", "journal": "Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

One common problem which hampers the clinical usage of tissue engineering constructs is a limited vascularization. In an attempt to accelerate the vascularization of tissue engineering constructs we compared the usage of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bmMSCs) and fragments derived from the aorta in vivo. Tissue engineering constructs composed of PLGA scaffolds containing Matrigel (n = 8), aortic fragments embedded in Matrigel (n = 8), bmMSCs embedded in Matrigel (n = 8), and aortic fragments embedded in Matrigel combined with bmMSCs (n = 8) were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of balb/c mice and analyzed repetitively over 14 days. In all groups a weak inflammatory response was transiently apparent. Vascularization was significantly (p = 0.05) accelerated in bmMSC and aortic fragments containing constructs compared with Matrigel alone, demonstrated by a distinctly increased microvascular density throughout the whole experiment. The combination of bmMSCs and aortic fragments showed no additional effect compared with bmMSCs and aortic fragments alone. The accelerated vascularization and microvascular density of tissue engineering constructs triggered by bmMSCs and aortic fragments is comparable.

The combined use of a fibular flap and allograft can provide a reliable reconstructive option. This article describes the authors' experience with this technique for the treatment of segmental bone defects after resection of humeral malignancy.\nFrom 2005 to 2008, seven patients that had intercalary resection of humeral malignancy underwent reconstruction with an allograft and vascularized fibula construct. Patients were examined clinically and radiographically.\nThe average age at time of operation was 16.7 years. The mean follow-up time was 27.7 months. The average length of the resected humeral segment was 10.6 cm and that of the fibula flap was 13.1 cm. The average time of union of fibula was 20.7 weeks and for union of allograft was 26.3 weeks. Incorporation of the fibula into the allograft was seen in three patients. There were no allograft fractures and no infections. Three patients had surgery-related complications including a temporary radial nerve paralysis in 1, wound dehiscence in 1, and clawed toes in 1. The MSTS average score was 95.2% at final follow-up.\nIntramedullary fibular flaps in combination with massive allografts provide an excellent option for reconstruction of large bony defects after humeral malignancy extirpation.

{"title": "Genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of cannabinoid CB1 receptor inhibits angiogenesis.", "abstract": "In this study we investigated the role of CB1 receptor signaling in angiogenesis and the therapeutic exploitation of CB1 inactivation as an antiangiogenic strategy. We started from the observation that CB1 receptor expression is induced during angiogenesis and that the endocannabinoid anandamide stimulated bFGF-induced angiogenesis in the nanomolar physiologic range. To define the functional involvement of CB1 receptor signaling during angiogenesis, 2 different strategies have been carried out: siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacologic antagonism of CB1 receptors. CB1 receptors inactivation resulted in the inhibition of bFGF-induced endothelial proliferation, migration, and capillary-like tube formation, through prosurvival and migratory pathways involving ERK, Akt, FAK, JNK, Rho, and MMP-2. To corroborate the potential therapeutic exploitation of CB1 blockade as an antiangiogenic strategy, we performed in vivo assays founding that CB1 blockade was able to inhibit bFGF-induced neovascular growth in the rabbit cornea assay. A relevant finding was the ability to reduce ocular pathologic neo-vascularization in mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy.

{"title": "Mechanical factors in the development of the vascular bed.", "abstract": "During embryonic development, blood flow is needed not only to nourish the developing embryo but is also important for shaping the vascular network such that it becomes hemodynamically efficient. The first blood vessels form a network called the capillary plexus. After the onset of blood flow, the capillary plexus remodel into a more hierarchical tree-shaped network. Mechanical forces created by blood flow are required for remodelling to occur and these forces are believed to induce a maturation of the blood vessels that stabilizes the growing vascular network. The role of mechanical force has been extensively studied in the mature cardiovascular system. Though the events induced by blood flow during development are thought to be similar to what occurs in the adult, there are several important differences between the embryo and the adult. We therefore discuss what is known about the role of mechanical forces in vascular remodelling from the adult cardiovascular system and highlight how embryonic development differs from the adult.

{"title": "Follicular Viability and Histological Alterations after Auto-transplantation of Dog Ovaries by Experimentally Inducing Blood Sinus on Stomach.", "abstract": "Currently, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are considered most effective methods for cancer treatment, however these strategies often result in fertility problems. A favorable alternative to prevent fertility loss in cancer patients is the cryopreservation and transplantation of sexual tissues (ovaries and/or testes). There is a low rate of fertilization following cryopreservation of ovaries prior to implantation. Therefore, in our opinion, this low rate is caused by instable blood flow during organ transplantation. Thus, this study researches a canine ovarian model that focuses on direct exposure of ovaries with blood in an experimentally induced sinus-like cavity. We implanted this tissue on the muscular layer of the stomach, which is its most vascularized region.\nOvarian transplantation was conducted on T1 animals (n=5), bilateral ovariectomy was performed on T2 animals (n=5), unilateral ovariectomy was conducted on T3 cases and animals in the control-sham group (n=5) did not undergo ovariectomy or transplantation.\nAll isotransplanted ovaries survived. Ovaries resumed follicular growth and revascularization. Transplanted ovaries contained 75%-76% of survived small follicles (pre antral) after 60 days. The ovarian granulosa cells showed considerable resistance against ischemia. After day 30 no statistically significant differences in the level of estradiol and progesterone were observed between T1 animals and the T3 group. T1 animals showed considerably high levels of progesterone and estradiol in comparison to T2 cases.\nThis study showed that using blood sinus method for ovarian isotransplantation helps ovarian tissue to survive from post implantation ischemia which confirms with normal follicles presentation and intact endocrine function of the implanted ovaries.", "journal": "International journal of fertility & sterility", "date": "2011-04-01", "authors": ["HazhirKhoram", "AlirezaNajafpour", "MazdakRazi"], "doi": null}

In this article, we evaluated whether endothelialized module-driven vascularization enhances islet engraftment in diabetic rats. Two thousand islets were transplanted in the omental pouch of syngeneic and allogeneic immunosuppressed diabetic recipients as free islets, islets in collagen modules, or islets in endothelialized modules. Transplantation of islets in endothelialized modules significantly increased the vessel density compared with controls. Donor green fluorescent protein-positive endothelial cells (ECs) formed vessels in proximity to transplanted islets; donor vessels connected to host vasculature as the vessels included erythrocytes in their lumens and were supported by host smooth muscle cells by 21 days. Transplantation of 2000 islets reversed diabetes in two of five of syngeneic recipients until 60 days, although there was no apparent benefit to islet function of adding ECs relative to collagen modules without EC. However, there was a trend toward increased viability when islets were implanted in endothelialized modules compared with collagen modules at 21 days. Meanwhile, 2000 islets in allogeneic immunosuppressed recipients lowered blood glucose levels short term, but there was graft failure within 1 week. This study explored the simultaneous transplantation of primary ECs with islets in diabetic recipients. The endothelialized modular approach increased vessel density around transplanted islets. Further modulation (i.e., acceleration) of vessel maturation, is presumed necessary to improve islet engraftment.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

A microsurgically created A-V loop was placed around the scaffold, encased in an isolation chamber in Lewis rats. HA-hydrogel supported growth of osteoblasts over 8 weeks and allowed sustained release of BMP-2 over 35 days.

Thus, metabolic stress-induced necrosis has important clinical implications for tumor development; however, its regulatory mechanisms have been poorly investigated.\nHere, we show that the transcription factor Snail, a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is induced in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner in both two-dimensional culture of cancer cells, including A549, HepG2, and MDA-MB-231, in response to GD and the inner regions of a multicellular tumor spheroid system, an in vitro model of solid tumors and of human tumors. Snail short hairpin (sh) RNA inhibited metabolic stress-induced necrosis in two-dimensional cell culture and in multicellular tumor spheroid system. Snail shRNA-mediated necrosis inhibition appeared to be linked to its ability to suppress metabolic stress-induced mitochondrial ROS production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition, which are the primary events that trigger necrosis.\nTaken together, our findings demonstrate that Snail is implicated in metabolic stress-induced necrosis, providing a new function for Snail in tumor progression.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-03-31", "authors": ["Cho HeeKim", "Hyun MinJeon", "Su YeonLee", "Min KyungJu", "Ji YoungMoon", "Hye GyeongPark", "Mi-AeYoo", "Byung TaeChoi", "Jong InYook", "Sung-ChulLim", "Song IyHan", "Ho SungKang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0018000"}

Pax6 expression was analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Eye sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Schiff reagent, and fluorescein, to assess morphologic changes, the presence of goblet cells, and barrier integrity, respectively. Gene expression changes in mildly affected Pax6 Tg corneas were compared to age-matched, wild-type (WT) corneas by microarray analysis and quantitative PCR. Promoter regulation of several differentially expressed genes was examined by monitoring luciferase activity of reporter constructs after cotransfection with Pax6 in COS7 cells.\nCorneal overexpression of Pax6 produces an abnormal cornea with altered epithelial cell morphology, neovascularization, immune cell invasion, and a compromised barrier; the lens appeared normal. Major changes in expression of genes involved in immune function, vascularization, and epithelial differentiation occurred in corneas from Pax6 Tg versus WT mice. The keratin (K) profile was dramatically altered in the Pax6 Tg corneas, as were several components of the Wnt signaling pathway. In severely affected Pax6 Tg corneas, K12 was reduced, and Pax6 was redistributed into the cytoplasm.

Alpha-dystroglycan, a substrate of POMGnT1, is concentrated around the blood vessels, in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), and in the inner limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina. Mutations of the POMGnT1 gene in humans cause muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease. Several ocular abnormalities including retinal dysplasia, ERG abnormalities, and retinal detachments have been reported in patients with MEB. We have analyzed the eyes of POMGnT1-deficient mice, generated by standard gene targeting technique, to study the retinal abnormalities. Clinical examination of adult mutant mice revealed a high incidence (81% by 12-months-of-age) of retinal detachments. Sheathing of the retinal vessels and the presence of ectopic fibrous tissues around the optic nerve head were also found. Histological examinations showed focal retinal detachment associated with GFAP immunopositivity. The ILM of the mutant mice was disrupted with ectopic cells near the disruptions. The expression of Dp71, a shorter isoform of dystrophin, was severely reduced in the ILM and around retinal blood vessels of POMGnT1-deficient mice.

Here, this border is described in the cat cochlear nerve using light microscopical sections, and scanning electron microscopy of the CNS-PNS interfaces exposed by fracture of the nerve either prior to or following critical point drying. The CNS-PNS border represents an abrupt change in type of myelin, supporting elements, and vascularization. Because central myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes and peripheral myelin by Schwann cells, the myelinated fibers are as a rule equipped with a node of Ranvier at the border passage. The border is shallower and smoother in cat cochlear nerve than expected from other nerves, and the borderline nodes are largely in register. The loose endoneurial connective tissue of the PNS compartment is closed at the border by a compact glial membrane, the mantle zone, of the CNS compartment. The mantle zone is penetrated by the nerve fibers, but is otherwise composed of astrocytes and their interwoven processes like the external limiting membrane of the brain surface with which it is continuous. The distal surface of the mantle zone is covered by a fenestrated basal lamina. Only occasional vessels traverse the border. From an anatomical point of view, the border might be expected to be a weak point along the cochlear nerve and thus vulnerable to trauma. In mature animals, the CNS-PNS border presents a barrier to regrowth of regenerating nerve fibers and to invasion of the CNS by Schwann cells. An understanding of this region in the cochlear nerve is therefore relevant to head injuries that lead to hearing loss, to surgery on acoustic Schwannomas, and to the possibility of cochlear nerve regeneration.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2011-03-31", "authors": ["Kirsten KOsen", "David NFurness", "Carole MHackney"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.012"}

We have focused on the development of tumor pO(2) as a surrogate marker to identify the therapeutic window during metronomic chemotherapy.We report the effect of four weekly administrations of cyclophosphamide (140 mg/Kg, i.p), a chemo drug, on tumor pO(2) and growth of subcutaneous 9L tumors in SCID mice. The repeated measurement of tumor pO(2) was carried out using in vivo EPR oximetry. The subcutaneous 9L tumors were hypoxic with a pre-treatment tumor pO(2) of 5.1 \u00b1 1 mmHg and a tumor volume of 236 \u00b1 45 mm3 on day 0. The tumor pO(2) increased significantly to 26.2 \u00b1 2 mmHg on day 10, and remained at an elevated level till day 31 during weekly treatments with cyclophosphamide. The tumor pO(2) then declined to 20 \u00b1 9 mmHg on day 43. The tumor volume of the control group increased significantly with no change in tumor pO(2)over days.Results indicate a transient increase in tumor pO(2) during metronomic chemotherapy of 9L gliomas and could be potentially used as a marker to identify vessel normalization during metronomic chemotherapy.

{"title": "Endoglin regulates cancer-stromal cell interactions in prostate tumors.", "abstract": "Endoglin is an accessory receptor for TGF-\u03b2 that has been implicated in prostate cancer cell detachment, migration, and invasiveness. However, the pathophysiologic significance of endoglin with respect to prostate tumorigenesis has yet to be fully established. In this study, we addressed this question by investigation of endoglin-dependent prostate cancer progression in a TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate) mouse model where endoglin was genetically deleted. In this model, endoglin was haploinsufficient such that its allelic deletion slightly increased the frequency of tumorigenesis, yet produced smaller, less vascularized, and less metastatic tumors than TRAMP control tumors. Most strikingly, TRAMP:eng(+/-)-derived tumors lacked the pronounced infiltration of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) that characterize TRAMP prostate tumors. Studies in human primary prostate-derived stromal cells (PrSC) confirmed that suppressing endoglin expression decreased cell proliferation, the ability to recruit endothelial cells, and the ability to migrate in response to tumor cell-conditioned medium. We found increased levels of secreted insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) in the conditioned medium from endoglin-deficient PrSCs and that endoglin-dependent regulation of IGFBP-4 secretion was crucial for stromal cell-conditioned media to stimulate prostate tumor cell growth.

{"title": "Partial aortic occlusion and cerebral venous steal: venous effects of arterial manipulation in acute stroke.", "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke therapy emphasizes early arterial clot lysis or removal. Partial aortic occlusion has recently emerged as an alternative hemodynamic approach to augment cerebral perfusion in acute ischemic stroke. The exact mechanism of cerebral flow augmentation with partial aortic occlusion remains unclear and may involve more than simple diversion of arterial blood flow from the lower body to cerebral collateral circulation. The cerebral venous steal hypothesis suggests that even a small increase in tissue pressure in the ischemic area will divert blood flow to surrounding regions with lesser tissue pressures. This may cause no-reflow (absence of flow after restoration of arterial patency) in the ischemic core and \"luxury perfusion\" in the surrounding regions. Such maldistribution may be reversed with increased venous pressure titrated to avoid changes in intracranial pressure. We propose that partial aortic occlusion enhances perfusion in the brain by offsetting cerebral venous steal. Partial aortic occlusion redistributes blood volume into the upper part of the body, manifested by an increase in central venous pressure. Increased venous pressure recruits the collapsed vascular network and, by eliminating cerebral venous steal, corrects perifocal perfusion maldistribution analogous to positive end-expiratory pressure recruitment of collapsed airways to decrease ventilation/perfusion mismatch in the lungs.", "journal": "Stroke", "date": "2011-03-29", "authors": ["OsvaldasPranevicius", "MindaugasPranevicius", "David SLiebeskind"], "doi": "10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.603852"}

{"title": "Placental vasculogenesis is regulated by keratin-mediated hyperoxia in murine decidual tissues.", "abstract": "The mammalian placenta represents the interface between maternal and embryonic tissues and provides nutrients and gas exchange during embryo growth. Recently, keratin intermediate filament proteins were found to regulate embryo growth upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway through glucose transporter relocalization and to contribute to yolk sac vasculogenesis through altered bone morphogenetic protein 4 signaling. Whether keratins have vital functions in extraembryonic tissues is not well understood. Here, we report that keratins are essential for placental function. In the absence of keratins, we find hyperoxia in the decidual tissue directly adjacent to the placenta, because of an increased maternal vasculature. Hyperoxia causes impaired vasculogenesis through defective hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, resulting in invagination defects of fetal blood vessels into the chorion. In turn, the reduced labyrinth, together with impaired gas exchange between maternal and embryonic blood, led to increased hypoxia in keratin-deficient embryos. We provide evidence that keratin-positive trophoblast secretion of prolactin-like protein a (Prlpa) and placental growth factor (PlGF) during decidualization are altered in the absence of keratins, leading to increased infiltration of uterine natural killer cells into placental vicinity and increased vascularization of the maternal decidua. Our findings suggest that keratin mutations might mediate conditions leading to early pregnancy loss due to hyperoxia in the decidua.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2011-03-26", "authors": ["CorneliaKr\u00f6ger", "PreethiVijayaraj", "UrsulaReuter", "ReinhardWindoffer", "DavidSimmons", "LukasHeukamp", "RudolfLeube", "Thomas MMagin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.12.055"}

Frozen and thawed PRP contains high concentrations of various growth factors (GFs) and F/P MPs effectively adsorb those GFs. Human microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) and dermal fibroblast cells (DFCs) were optimally grown in medium containing 4% PRP and the addition of F/P MPs significantly maintained and protected the proliferative activity of PRP incubated at 37\u00b0C for more than 10 days. When PRP-containing F/P MPs were subcutaneously injected into the back of mice, significant neovascularization was induced near the injected site with enhanced filtration of inflammatory cells from day 3 to day 30, compared with controls (injections of PRP, F/P MPs, and saline). Both PRP-containing F/P MPs and PRP alone induced significant formation of granulation tissue at the injected site. However, thickness of induced granulation tissues was well maintained for 30 days only in PRP-containing F/P MP-injected group. Those bound GFs may be gradually diffused and released from F/P MPs in vitro and in vivo. Thereby, PRP-containing F/P MPs offer significantly higher inductions of vascularization and fibrous tissue formation in vivo than PRP alone.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

We examined the usefulness of manometry in obtaining quantitative data on swallowing function in patients after mandibular bone partial resection. Postsurgical swallowing function was investigated, using a combination of videofluorography (VF) and manometry, in five patients with oral cancer, who underwent mandibular bone partial resection. Three patients underwent reconstruction of soft tissue defects only, while the remaining two patients underwent reconstruction of both soft tissue defects and a bony segment using a reconstruction plate or vascularized fibula with a skin paddle. Oropharyngeal swallowing pressure ranged from 61 to 82 mmHg compared to the normal range of 109 \u00b1 31 mmHg (mean \u00b1 SD). Partial resection of the mandible without reconstruction of the bony segment defect had a negative effect upon oropharyngeal swallowing pressure. Four of the five patients exhibited normal function in the oral stage. Elevation of the larynx was disturbed in 80% of the patients. None of the patients in this study experienced aspiration after surgery. In conclusion, a combination of VF and manometry revealed that mandibular bone partial resection resulted in disturbed elevation of the larynx while pharyngeal swallowing pressure decreases in those patients who do not undergo bony segment reconstruction.

{"title": "Assembly and patterning of the vascular network of the vertebrate hindbrain.", "abstract": "The cranial vasculature is essential for the survival and development of the central nervous system and is important in stroke and other brain pathologies. Cranial vessels form in a reproducible and evolutionarily conserved manner, but the process by which these vessels assemble and acquire their stereotypic patterning remains unclear. Here, we examine the stepwise assembly and patterning of the vascular network of the zebrafish hindbrain. The major artery supplying the hindbrain, the basilar artery, runs along the ventral keel of the hindbrain in all vertebrates. We show that this artery forms by a novel process of medial sprouting and migration of endothelial cells from a bilateral pair of primitive veins, the primordial hindbrain channels. Subsequently, a second wave of dorsal sprouting from the primordial hindbrain channels gives rise to angiogenic central arteries that penetrate into and innervate the hindbrain. The chemokine receptor cxcr4a is expressed in migrating endothelial cells of the primordial hindbrain channels, whereas its ligand cxcl12b is expressed in the hindbrain neural keel immediately adjacent to the assembling basilar artery. Knockdown of either cxcl12b or cxcr4a results in defects in basilar artery formation, showing that the assembly and patterning of this crucial artery depends on chemokine signaling.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2011-03-25", "authors": ["MisatoFujita", "Young RCha", "Van NPham", "AtsukoSakurai", "Beth LRoman", "J SilvioGutkind", "Brant MWeinstein"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.058776"}

In addition, we find that chemokine signaling specifically controls arterial-venous network formation in the brain. Zebrafish mutants for the chemokine receptor cxcr4a or its ligand cxcl12b establish a decreased number of arterial-venous connections, leading to the formation of an unperfused and interconnected blood vessel network. We further find that expression of cxcr4a in newly forming brain capillaries is negatively regulated by blood flow. Accordingly, unperfused vessels continue to express cxcr4a, whereas connection of these vessels to the arterial circulation leads to rapid downregulation of cxcr4a expression and loss of angiogenic characteristics in endothelial cells, such as filopodia formation.

Deafness and vestibular dysfunction in the corresponding mouse model, Slc26a4(-/-), are associated with an enlargement and acidification of the membranous labyrinth. Here we relate the onset of expression of the HCO(3) (-) transporter pendrin to the luminal pH and to enlargement-associated epithelial cell stretching. We determined expression with immunocytochemistry, cell stretching by digital morphometry and pH with double-barreled ion-selective electrodes. Pendrin was first expressed in the endolymphatic sac at embryonic day (E) 11.5, in the cochlear hook-region at E13.5, in the utricle and saccule at E14.5, in ampullae at E16.5, and in the upper turn of the cochlea at E17.5. Epithelial cell stretching in Slc26a4(-/-) mice began at E14.5. pH changes occurred first in the cochlea at E15.5 and in the endolymphatic sac at E17.5. At postnatal day 2, stria vascularis, outer sulcus and Reissner's membrane epithelial cells, and utricular and saccular transitional cells were stretched, whereas sensory cells in the cochlea, utricle and saccule did not differ between Slc26a4(+/-) and Slc26a4(-/-) mice. Structural development of stria vascularis, including vascularization, was retarded in Slc26a4(-/-) mice. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that the enlargement and stretching of non-sensory epithelial cells precedes luminal acidification in the cochlea and the endolymphatic sac. Stretching and luminal acidification may alter cell-to-cell communication and lead to the observed retarded development of stria vascularis, which may be an important step on the path to deafness in Slc26a4(-/-) mice, and possibly in humans, lacking functional pendrin expression.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-03-23", "authors": ["Hyoung-MiKim", "PhilineWangemann"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0017949"}

However, the molecular determinants that reverse this endothelial quiescence to facilitate pathological angiogenesis are not yet completely understood. This review examines a critical regulatory switch at the level of Ras that activates this angiogenic switch process and the role that microRNAs play in this process.\nIn the last few years, microRNAs, a new class of small RNA molecules, have emerged as key regulators of several cellular processes, including angiogenesis. MicroRNAs such as miR-126, miR-296, and miR-92a have been shown to play important roles in angiogenesis. We recently described how miR-132, an angiogenic growth factor inducible microRNA in the endothelium, facilitates pathological angiogenesis by downregulating p120RasGAP, a molecular brake for Ras. Importantly, targeting miR-132 with a complementary, synthetic antimicroRNA restored the brake and decreased angiogenesis and tumor burden in multiple tumor models. Taken together, emerging evidence suggests a central role for microRNAs downstream of multiple growth factors in regulating endothelial proliferation, migration, and vascular patterning.\nFurther research into miR-132-p120RasGAP biology and more broadly, microRNA regulation of Ras pathways in the endothelium will not only advance our understanding of angiogenesis but also provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention.", "journal": "Current opinion in hematology", "date": "2011-03-23", "authors": ["SudarshanAnand", "David ACheresh"], "doi": "10.1097/MOH.0b013e328345a180"}

{"title": "Mandibular reconstruction using an axially vascularized tissue-engineered construct.", "abstract": "Current reconstructive techniques for continuity defects of the mandible include the use of free flaps, bone grafts, and alloplastic materials. New methods of regenerative medicine designed to restore tissues depend mainly on the so-called extrinsic neovascularization, where the neovascular bed originates from the periphery of the construct. This method is not applicable for large defects in irradiated fields.\nWe are introducing a new animal model for mandibular reconstruction using intrinsic axial vascularization by the Arterio-Venous (AV) loop. In order to test this model, we made cadaveric, mechanical loading, and surgical pilot studies on adult male goats. The cadaveric study aimed at defining the best vascular axis to be used in creating the AV loop in the mandibular region. Mechanical loading studies (3 points bending test) were done to ensure that the mechanical properties of the mandible were significantly affected by the designed defect, and to put a base line for further mechanical testing after bone regeneration. A pilot surgical study was done to ensure smooth operative and post operative procedures.\nThe best vascular axis to reconstruct defects in the posterior half of the mandible is the facial artery (average length 32.5 \u00b1 1.9 mm, caliber 2.5 mm), and facial vein (average length 33.3 \u00b1 1.8 mm, caliber 2.6 mm). Defects in the anterior half require an additional venous graft. The defect was shown to be significantly affecting the mechanical properties of the mandible (P value 0.0204). The animal was able to feed on soft diet from the 3rd postoperative day and returned to normal diet within a week. The mandible did not break during the period of follow up (2 months).\nOur model introduces the concept of axial vascularization of mandibular constructs. This model can be used to assess bone regeneration for large bony defects in irradiated fields. This is the first study to introduce the concept of axial vascularization using the AV loop for angiogenesis in the mandibular region. Moreover, this is the first study aiming at axial vascularization of synthetic tissue engineering constructs at the site of the defect without any need for tissue transfer (in contrast to what was done previously in prefabricated flaps).", "journal": "Annals of surgical innovation and research", "date": "2011-03-23", "authors": ["Ahmad MEweida", "Ayman SNabawi", "Mona KMarei", "Mohamed RKhalil", "Habashi AElhammady"], "doi": "10.1186/1750-1164-5-2\n10.1007/s10006-006-0004-x\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2649\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000082817.26407.86\n10.1080/08941930290085967\n10.1089/107632702753725058\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.1721\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00280-5\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00012.x\n10.1097/00006534-199101000-00017\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.04.003\n10.1054/ijom.2002.0332\n10.1097/00006534-199607000-00017\n10.2460/ajvr.2005.66.1039\n10.1359/jbmr.060120\n10.1177/154405910508401204\n10.1177/0022034509352151\n10.1089/10763270050199541\n10.1096/fj.06-6614com\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0085\n10.1002/micr.20564\n10.1002/term.229\n10.1016/0266-7681(94)90212-7\n10.1089/teb.2007.0299\n10.1002/micr.20407"}

To enrich for analogous human progenitor cell types that stimulate islet regeneration, we purified human BM based on high-aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(hi)), an enzymatic function conserved in hematopoietic, endothelial, and mesenchymal progenitor lineages. We investigated the contributions of ALDH(hi) mixed progenitor cells or culture-expanded, ALDH-purified multipotent stromal cell (MSC) subsets to activate endogenous programs for islet regeneration after transplantation into streptozotocin-treated NOD/SCID mice. Intravenous injection of uncultured BM ALDH(hi) cells improved systemic hyperglycemia and augmented insulin secretion by increasing islet size and vascularization, without increasing total islet number. Augmented proliferation within regenerated endogenous islets and associated vascular endothelium indicated the induction of islet-specific proliferative and pro-angiogenic programs. Although cultured MSC from independent human BM samples showed variable capacity to improve islet function, and prolonged expansion diminished hyperglycemic recovery, transplantation of ALDH-purified regenerative MSC reduced hyperglycemia and augmented total beta cell mass by stimulating the formation of small beta cell clusters associated with the ductal epithelium, without evidence of increased islet vascularization or Ngn3(+) endocrine precursor activation. Thus, endogenous islet recovery after progenitor cell transplantation can occur via distinct regenerative mechanisms modulated by subtypes of progenitor cells administered.

For those patients under intense adjuvant chemotherapy and with massive bone loss, free vascularized fibular grafting is currently advocated as a reliable reconstructive option, maybe because of the controversial results of bone transport in similar situations. However, when there is a vascular abnormality of either the recipient or donor extremity, microsurgical procedures are not feasible, further limiting potential reconstructive alternatives.\nWe present the case of a 13-year-old female patient with Ewing's sarcoma of the right tibia. Preoperative angiography showed that vascularity of the affected side depended totally on a single peroneal artery. The patient was treated initially with multiagent chemotherapy, followed by an excision of 23 cm. The defect was bridged by a gradual medial transportation of the ipsilateral fibula with the Ilizarov technique and strengthened by nonvascularized transfer of the contralateral fibula.\nTotal external fixation time was 162 days. After the removal of the Ilizarov frame a walking cast was applied for another month. At 5 years postoperatively there was no recurrence of the malignancy. The patient had full weight-bearing ability on the affected limb, with preservation of the ankle and knee joints motion and without any limb length discrepancy or axial deformity. The functional outcome that was visible was graded excellent.\nTransverse distraction osteogenesis of the ipsilateral fibula performed well under chemotherapy, showing unproblematic callus formation. Supplemented with nonvascularized transfer of the contralateral fibula, provided a reconstructive option with biological affinity, sufficient biomechanical strength and durability, and with a decreased complication rate. This case report presents a viable option, especially in cases in which vascular abnormalities of either the donor or the recipient limb, combined with multiagent chemotherapy, restrict potential reconstructive alternatives.

Vessels were composed of EPCs with perivascular cells on their abluminal surfaces. EPCs injected alone formed a low density of blood vessels in collagen and PuraMatrix, while MPCs injected alone resulted in sparse vessel networks in all ECMs tested.

Collagen and fibrin were the stiffest matrices to support extensive vascularization, with storage moduli in the range 385-510 Pa, while Matrigel, at 80 Pa, and PuraMatrix, at 5 Pa, were far more compliant.

By contrast, feather colors are generally assumed to be relatively static, changing by small amounts only over periods of months. However, this assumption has rarely been tested even though structural colors of feathers are produced by ordered nanostructures that are analogous to those in the aforementioned dynamic systems. Feathers are neither innervated nor vascularized and therefore any color change must be caused by external stimuli. Thus, we here explore how feathers of iridescent mourning doves Zenaida macroura respond to a simple stimulus: addition and evaporation of water. After three rounds of experimental wetting and subsequent evaporation, iridescent feather color changed hue, became more chromatic and increased in overall reflectance by almost 50%. To understand the mechanistic basis of this change, we used electron microscopy to examine macro- and nanostructures before and after treatment. Transmission electron microscopy and transfer matrix thin-film models revealed that color is produced by thin-film interference from a single (\u223c 35 nm layer of keratin around the edge of feather barbules, beneath which lies a layer of air and melanosomes. After treatment, the most striking morphological difference was a twisting of colored barbules that exposed more of their surface area for reflection, explaining the observed increase in brightness.

The excised membranes were studied by light microscopy with hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and toluidine blue stains. Immunohistochemical and transmission electron microscopic examination were also used.\nLight microscopic examination revealed that the retro-KPro fibrous membranes originated from the host's corneal stroma. These mildly to moderately vascularized membranes grew through gaps in the Descemet membrane to reach behind the KPro back plate and adhere to the anterior iris surface, which had undergone partial lysis. In 2 cases, the fibrous membranes merged at the pupil with matrical portions of metaplastic lens epithelium, forming a bilayered structure that crossed the optical axis. Retro-KPro membranes stained positively for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin but negatively for pancytokeratin. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of actin filaments within myofibroblasts and small surviving clusters of metaplastic lens epithelial cells.\nStromal downgrowth, rather than epithelial downgrowth, was the major element of the retro-KPro membranes in this series.

PDL1 is expressed not only on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) but also cardiac endothelium. In this study, we investigated the importance of PDL1 expression on donor cardiac allograft in acquired transplantation tolerance in a fully MHC-mismatched model. We generated PDL1 chimeric mice on B6 background that expressed PDL1 on either hematopoietic cells or nonhematopoietic cells of the heart. Sham animals were used as controls. These hearts were then transplanted into BALB/c recipients and treated with CTLA4-Ig to induce tolerance. Cardiac endothelium showed significant expression of PDL1, which was upregulated upon transplantation. While the absence of PDL1 on hematopoietic cells of the heart resulted in delayed rejection and prevented long-term tolerance in most but not all recipients, we observed an accelerated and early graft rejection of all donor allografts that lacked PDL1 on the endothelium. Moreover, PDL1-deficient endothelium hearts had significant higher frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing alloreactive cells as well as higher frequency of CD8(+) effector T cells. These findings demonstrate that PDL1 expression mainly on donor endothelium is functionally important in a fully allogeneic mismatched model for the induction of cardiac allograft tolerance.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2011-03-16", "authors": ["L VRiella", "TWatanabe", "P TSage", "JYang", "MYeung", "JAzzi", "VVanguri", "AChandraker", "A HSharpe", "M HSayegh", "NNajafian"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03451.x"}

Here, we use phylogenetic comparative analyses to study correlates of species richness for the largest Neotropical amphibian radiation: New World direct-developing frogs. Clade-age and species richness were nonsignificantly, negatively correlated, suggesting that clade age alone does not explain among-clade variation in species richness. A combination of ecological and morphological traits explained 65% of the variance in species richness. A more vascularized ventral skin, the ability to colonize high-altitude ranges, encompassing a large variety of vegetation types, correlated significantly with species richness, whereas larger body size was marginally correlated with species richness.

{"title": "Femoral head osteonecrosis: why choose free vascularized fibula grafting.", "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a disease in which bone death occurs and usually progresses to articular incongruity and subsequent osteoarthritis. To delay the process of the disease and the conversion to total hip arthroplasty, many surgical techniques have been described. Core decompression, nonvascularized autologous bone grafts, porous tantalum implant procedure, and various osteotomies have been used for the management of early precollapse stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. However, none of these procedures is neither entirely effective nor can obtain predictable results. With the progress of microsurgery, the implantation of a free vascularized fibula graft to the necrotic femoral head has provided the most consistently successful results. Although the procedure is technically demanding, there is growing recognition that the use of free vascularized fibula graft may improve patient quality of life by functional improvement and pain alleviation. The success of the procedure is related to decompression of the femoral head, excision of the necrotic bone, and addition of cancellous bone graft with osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, which augments revascularization and neoosteogenesis of the femoral head. Free vascularized fibula graft, especially in younger patients, is a salvaging procedure of the necrotic femoral head in early precollapse stages. In postcollapse osteonecrosis, the procedure appears to delay the need for total hip arthroplasty in the majority of patients.

We evaluated 30 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic CTS who were referred for surgery. Demographic data, subjective and objective data, and responses on an expanded assessment set, were collected before and 6 months after surgery. All patients underwent diagnostic neurophysiological testing prior to surgery, and histological analysis of tenosynovium specimens that were removed during surgery.

Vascular changes were noted in the tenosynovium of the flexor tendon of patients with CTS when compared with controls. Greater synovial vascularization was negative predictor of the SF-36's physical summary score before surgery. Bilateral presentation of symptoms and low nerve conduction velocity were negative predictors of the quality of life of patients after surgery for CTS.

Regression was assessed by the Salzer-Kuntschik regression scale. Microvessel density (MVD) of primary biopsies of 37 patients was determined by immunohistochemistry. Tumor regression was correlated with MVD of primary biopsies and other clinico-pathological parameters.\nRegression presented mainly as necrosis or fibrosis/sclerosis upon histopathology. MFH, leiomyosarcoma, or clear cell sarcoma (CCS) responded well; whereas liposarcomas, synovial sarcomas, or MPNST were poor responders. MFH often had abundant necrosis; while other STS mainly presented with fibrosis/sclerosis. MVD had no influence on regression grade but modulated histologic regression patterns. Excellent regression demonstrated a trend toward an association with improved survival and local control.\nTM-ILP yielded high response rates in STS.

{"title": "Effect of polycaprolactone scaffold permeability on bone regeneration in vivo.", "abstract": "Successful bone tissue engineering depends on the scaffold's ability to allow nutrient diffusion to and waste removal from the regeneration site, as well as provide an appropriate mechanical environment. Since bone is highly vascularized, scaffolds that provide greater mass transport may support increased bone regeneration. Permeability encompasses the salient features of three-dimensional porous scaffold architecture effects on scaffold mass transport. We hypothesized that higher permeability scaffolds will enhance bone regeneration for a given cell seeding density. We manufactured poly-\u025b-caprolactone scaffolds, designed to have the same internal pore design and either a low permeability (0.688\u00d710(-7)m(4)/N-s) or a high permeability (3.991\u00d710(-7)m(4)/N-s), respectively. Scaffolds were seeded with bone morphogenic protein-7-transduced human gingival fibroblasts and implanted subcutaneously in immune-compromised mice for 4 and 8 weeks. Micro-CT evaluation showed better bone penetration into high permeability scaffolds, with blood vessel infiltration visible at 4 weeks. Compression testing showed that scaffold design had more influence on elastic modulus than time point did and that bone tissue infiltration increased the mechanical properties of the high permeability scaffolds at 8 weeks. These results suggest that for polycaprolactone, a more permeable scaffold with regular architecture is best for in vivo bone regeneration.

The purpose of this study is to expedite the formation of blood vessels in porous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds by the delivery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). To establish a pro-angiogenic and pro-vasculogenic microenvironment, we employed EPCs seeded in PCL scaffold with surface-immobilized heparin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). EPCs seeded on scaffolds with VEGF exhibited phosphorylation of the receptor. After 7 days of subcutaneous implantation in immunodeficient mice, heparin-immobilized PCL scaffolds with VEGF induced significantly high density of blood vessel formation. The anastomosis of EPC-derived vessels with the host circulatory system was evident by the presence of murine erythrocytes in the lumen of human-CD31 positive vessels. A more uniform distribution of blood vessels was achieved within 2-mm thick scaffolds by seeding an optimal density of EPCs. The seeding of a higher density of EPC resulted in an increase in apoptosis and a concomitant decline in blood vessel formation at the scaffold's inner core. When co-seeded with other cells, the EPCs maintained the ability to accelerate vessel formation. The excessive expansion of EPCs in vitro was associated with a decline in their in vivo vasculogenic potential.

Herein we further dissect the involvement of VEGFA and its downstream transducers, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, and protein kinase C (PKC) in melanoma VM. The knockdown of VEGFR1 in three melanoma cell lines completely disrupts Matrigel-induced CLS formation, whereas inhibition of VEGFR2 kinase with a specific inhibitor, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (PTKi-II), does not affect the process, indicating that VEGFR2 signaling is not involved in VEGFA-mediated melanoma VM. Furthermore, among tested PKC isoforms, only PKC\u03b1 and \u03b4 are expressed in the melanoma cells during CLS formation. Pretreatment with selective PKC\u03b1 and \u03b4 inhibitors blocked CLS formation. However, inhibition of PKC\u03b1, but not PKC\u03b4, completely destroyed the previously formed CLS. Moreover, knockdown of PKC\u03b1, but not PKC\u03b4, using small interfering RNAs abrogated CLS formation, suggesting that PKC\u03b1 is the major contributory factor in melanoma VM. In-vivo experiments indicate that disruption of PKC\u03b1 signaling significantly reduces the signs of VM in allografted B16/F10 melanoma. These findings may contribute to the development of new therapeutic agents that target melanoma VM.", "journal": "Melanoma research", "date": "2011-03-11", "authors": ["AmaliaVartanian", "EugeniaStepanova", "IrinaGrigorieva", "ElicoSolomko", "AnatolyBaryshnikov", "MikhailLichinitser"], "doi": "10.1097/CMR.0b013e328343a237"}
{"title": "The novel lupus antigen related protein acheron enhances the development of human breast cancer.", "abstract": "Acheron (Achn) is a new member of the Lupus antigen family of RNA binding proteins. Previous studies have shown that Achn controls developmental decisions in neurons and muscle. In the human mammary gland, Achn expression is restricted to ductal myoepithelial cells. Microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry have shown that Achn expression is elevated in some basal-like ductal carcinomas. To study the possible role of Achn in breast cancer, we engineered human MDA-MB-231 cells to stably express enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged wild-type Achn (AchnWT), as well as Achn lacking either its nuclear localization signal (AchnNLS) or its nuclear export signal (AchnNES). In in vitro assays, AchnWT and AchnNES, but not AchnNLS, enhanced cell proliferation, lamellipodia formation, and invasive activity and drove expression of the elevated expression of the metastasis-associated proteins MMP-9 and VEGF. To determine if Achn could alter the behavior of human breast cancer cells in vivo, Achn-engineered MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into athymic SCID/Beige mice. AchnWT and AchnNES-expressing tumors displayed enhanced angiogenesis and an approximately 5-fold increase in tumor size relative to either control cells or those expressing AchnNLS. These data suggest that Achn enhances human breast tumor growth and vascularization and that this activity is dependent on nuclear localization.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2011-03-10", "authors": ["RongShao", "Steve JScully", "WeiYan", "BrookeBentley", "JamesMueller", "ChristineBrown", "CarolBigelow", "Lawrence MSchwartz"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.26015"}

High blood cholesterol and triglycerides serum levels are risk factors for atherosclerosis, and could be responsible for a decreased in the blood supply to the already poor vascularized IVD. We performed a frequency-matched case-control study to determine the serum levels of patients with symptomatic herniated lumbar disc. We examined the fasting serum lipid levels in 384 subjects who were operated at our institution. Group 1 included 169 consecutive patients (115 men and 54 women; mean age: 59.1 years, range 29-85) who underwent surgery for symptomatic disc herniation. Group 2 (control group) included 169 patients (115 men and 54 women; mean age: 61 years, range 26-86) who underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy for a meniscal tear in the same period. These patients were frequency-matched by age (within 3 years) and gender with patients of Group 1. Sera were extracted from blood samples and the concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined. When comparing the two groups, patients with symptomatic herniated lumbar disc showed statistically significant higher triglyceride concentration (P = 0.02) and total cholesterol concentration (P = 0.01).

YKL-40, a secreted glycoprotein, is overexpressed in patients with glioblastomas and has potential as a novel tumor biomarker. The molecular mechanisms of YKL-40 in glioblastoma development, however, are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role YKL-40 plays in the regulation of VEGF expression, tumor angiogenesis, and radioresistance. YKL-40 up-regulated VEGF expression in glioblastoma cell line U87, and both YKL-40 and VEGF synergistically promote endothelial cell angiogenesis. Interestingly, long term inhibition of VEGF up-regulated YKL-40. YKL-40 induced coordination of membrane receptor syndecan-1 and integrin \u03b1v\u03b25, and triggered a signaling cascade through FAK(397) to ERK-1 and ERK-2, leading to elevated VEGF and enhanced angiogenesis. In addition, \u03b3-irradiation of U87 cells increased YKL-40 expression that protects cell death through AKT activation and also enhances endothelial cell angiogenesis. Blockade of YKL-40 activity or expression decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in xenografted animals. Immunohistochemical analysis of human glioblastomas revealed a correlation between YKL-40, VEGF, and patient survival.

The preffered modalities for reconstruction of such a defect include vascularized/non-vascularized bone graft, osteoarticular allografts and custom-made prosthesis. We here present our experience with wide resection and non-vascularised autogenous fibula grafting for GCT of distal radius.\nTwelve patients with a mean age of 34.7 years (21-43 years) with Campanacci Grade II/III GCT of distal radius were managed with wide excision of tumor and reconstruction with ipsilateral nonvascularised fibula, fixed with small fragment plate to the remnant of the radius.

In this study, a mathematical analysis is used to identify exactly in which tissue types the Tofts models may be applied. The results show that the TM is accurate if and only if the tissue is weakly vascularised (small blood volume). The ETM is additionally accurate in highly perfused tissues (high blood flow). In tissues that are highly vascularised, or where tracer exchange is very fast or very slow, TM and ETM accurately fit the data but lead to a misinterpretation of the parameters. In tissue types with intermediate vascularity, perfusion and tracer exchange, neither model offers a good fit to the tissue concentrations. A good fit can be obtained with a measured input function by reducing the temporal resolution, but this does not improve the accuracy of the parameters. In conclusion, the Tofts models only produce reliable parameter values if the tissue is weakly vascularized (TM or ETM) or highly perfused (ETM).

Progression of arthritis was determined in treated and untreated mice by measuring ankle circumference and through histologic analysis. IL-17 and its downstream targets as well as cytokines promoting Th17 cell differentiation were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in CIA mouse ankles locally expressing adenoviral IL-27 as well as in control-treated mouse ankles. Ankles from both treatment groups were immunostained for neutrophil and monocyte migration (macrophages in the tissue). Finally, vascularization was quantified by histology and by determining ankle hemoglobin levels.\nEctopic expression of IL-27 in CIA mice ameliorated inflammation, lining hypertrophy, and bone erosion as compared with control-treated CIA mice. Serum and joint levels of IL-17 were significantly reduced in the IL-27-treated group compared with the control-treated group. Two of the main cytokines that induce Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 downstream target molecules were greatly down-regulated in CIA mouse ankles receiving forced expression of IL-27. The control mice had higher levels of vascularization and monocyte trafficking than did mice ectopically expressing IL-27.\nOur results suggest that increased levels of IL-27 relieve arthritis in CIA mouse ankles.

Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and its metabolizing enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) play important roles in endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether combined phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 and 4 inhibition ameliorates endothelial function by regulating the ADMA-DDAH axis.\nWe investigated the effects of the PDE3/4 inhibitor tolafentrine in vitro on endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. Effects of tolafentrine on the endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide pathway, DDAH expression, DDAH promoter activity, and cytokine release from endothelial cells and their subsequent influence on DDAH expression were investigated. In monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats, the effects of inhaled tolafentrine on DDAH expression and activity were investigated. Real-time-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and PDE activity assays suggested high expression of PDE3 and PDE4 isoforms in endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with PDE3/4 inhibitor significantly decreased ADMA-induced apoptosis via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway by induction of DDAH2. Chronic nebulization of PDE3/4 inhibitor significantly attenuated monocrotaline-induced hemodynamic, gas exchange abnormalities, vascular remodeling, and right heart hypertrophy. Interestingly, PDE3/4 inhibitor treatment reduced ADMA and elevated nitric oxide/cGMP levels. Mechanistically, this could be attributed to direct modulatory effects of cAMP on the promoter region of DDAH2, which was consequently found to be increased in expression and activity.

However, mouse is not a natural menstruation animal, and the menstruation model using external stimuli may not truly reflect the occurrence and development of the human menstrual process. Therefore, we established a model of menstruation based on human endometrial xenotransplantation. In this model, human endometrial tissues were transplanted subcutaneously into SCID mice that were ovarectomized and supplemented with estrogen and progestogen by silastic implants with a scheme imitating the endocrinological milieu of human menstrual cycle. Morphology, hormone levels, and expression of vimentin and cytokeratin markers were evaluated to confirm the menstrual-like changes in this model. With 28 days of hormone treatment, transplanted human endometrium survived and underwent proliferation, differentiation and disintegration, similar to human endometrium in vivo. Human CD45+ cells showed a peak of increase 28 days post-transplantation. Three days after progesterone withdrawal, mouse CD45+ cells increased rapidly in number and were significantly greater than human CD45+ cell counts. Mouse CD31+ blood vascular-like structures were detected in both transplanted and host tissues. After progesterone withdrawal, the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 2, and 9 were increased. In summary, we successfully established a human endometrial xenotransplantation model in SCID mice, based on the results of menstrual-like changes in which MMP-1, 2 and 9 are involved.

Our objectives here were to compare clinical and ultrasound evaluations of MCP and MTP joint synovitis and to determine the prevalence of predefined ultrasound abnormalities in JIA patients and healthy controls.\nStandardized physical and ultrasound assessments of the same joints were done in 31 consecutive patients with JIA and 41 healthy volunteers. Joint pain, motion limitation, and swelling were recorded. Ultrasonography was performed on the same joints by 2 trained sonographers who recorded synovial fluid, synovial hypertrophy, erosion, and power Doppler signal. Intraobserver reproducibility of ultrasonography was assessed.\nOf 558 peripheral joints examined in JIA patients, 69 (12.5%) had ultrasonographic synovitis and 83 (15%) had abnormal physical findings.

{"title": "A model of a radially expanding and contracting lymphangion.", "abstract": "The lymphatic system is an extensive vascular network featuring valves and contractile walls that pump interstitial fluid and plasma proteins back to the main circulation. Immune function also relies on the lymphatic system's ability to transport white blood cells. Failure to drain and pump this excess fluid results in edema characterized by fluid retention and swelling of limbs. It is, therefore, important to understand the mechanisms of fluid transport and pumping of lymphatic vessels. Unfortunately, there are very few studies in this area, most of which assume Poiseuille flow conditions. In vivo observations reveal that these vessels contract strongly, with diameter changes of the order of magnitude of the diameter itself over a cycle that lasts typically 2-3s. The radial velocity of the contracting vessel is on the order of the axial fluid velocity, suggesting that modeling flow in these vessels with a Poiseuille model is inappropriate. In this paper, we describe a model of a radially expanding and contracting lymphatic vessel and investigate the validity of assuming Poiseuille flow to estimate wall shear stress, which is presumably important for lymphatic endothelial cell mechanotransduction. Three different wall motions, periodic sinusoidal, skewed sinusoidal and physiologic wall motions, were investigated with steady and unsteady parabolic inlet velocities. Despite high radial velocities resulting from the wall motion, wall shear stress values were within 4% of quasi-static Poiseuille values. Therefore, Poiseuille flow is valid for the estimation of wall shear stress for the majority of the lymphangion contractile cycle.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2011-03-08", "authors": ["ElahehRahbar", "James EMoore"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.02.018"}
{"title": "Integrin-assisted drug delivery of nano-scaled polymer therapeutics bearing paclitaxel.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays a prominent role in cancer progression. Anti-angiogenic therapy therefore, either alone or in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapy, offers a promising therapeutic approach. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely-used potent cytotoxic drug that also exhibits anti-angiogenic effects at low doses. However, its use, at its full potential, is limited by severe side effects. Here we designed and synthesized a targeted conjugate of PTX, a polymer and an integrin-targeted moiety resulting in a polyglutamic acid (PGA)-PTX-E-[c(RGDfK)(2)] nano-scaled conjugate. Polymer conjugation converted PTX to a macromolecule, which passively targets the tumor tissue exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention effect, while extravasating via the leaky tumor neovasculature. The cyclic RGD peptidomimetic enhanced the effects previously seen for PGA-PTX alone, utilizing the additional active targeting to the \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) integrin overexpressed on tumor endothelial and epithelial cells. This strategy is particularly valuable when tumors are well-vascularized, but they present poor vascular permeability. We show that PGA is enzymatically-degradable leading to PTX release under lysosomal acidic pH. PGA-PTX-E-[c(RGDfK)(2)] inhibited the growth of proliferating \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3)-expressing endothelial cells and several cancer cells. We also showed that PGA-PTX-E-[c(RGDfK)(2)] blocked endothelial cells migration towards vascular endothelial growth factor; blocked capillary-like tube formation; and inhibited endothelial cells attachment to fibrinogen. Orthotopic studies in mice demonstrated preferential tumor accumulation of the RGD-bearing conjugate, leading to enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and a marked decrease in toxicity as compared with free PTX-treated mice.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-03-08", "authors": ["AnatEldar-Boock", "KerenMiller", "JoaquinSanchis", "RuthLupu", "Mar\u00eda JVicent", "RonitSatchi-Fainaro"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.073"}

However, a unique technique has not been established in specialized centers so far. The radial forearm phalloplasty and the free fibular flap are the most common procedures for neophallus construction. There are 3 modifications for the radial forearm flap: the double folded \"tube into tube\" flap with a central vascularized urethra, the radial forearm flap with a vascularized urethra in the ulnar part of the flap and the radial forearm phalloplasty with a prelaminated neo-urethra using a full thickness skin graft. A series of 19 phalloplasties was performed between 2003 and 2010 in our department. The first cases of the series were conducted using the \"tube-into-tube-technique\" with the central urethra. However, the surgical concept was changed for the majority of cases (n=15) due to complications and not satisfying esthetic results. The phalloplasties were performed using the technique with a prelaminated urethra from 2005 on. The urethra prelamination was carried out using a full thickness skingraft 6 months before the actual phalloplasty procedure. Skin harvest was performed during mastectomy in the ideal case but otherwise alternatively from the lower belly. The complication rate in our series was comparable to the results of other authors. The esthetic results were very satisfying and the donor side morbidity was kept as minor as possible.

{"title": "A novel hyperthermia treatment for bone metastases using magnetic materials.", "abstract": "Patients with bone metastases in the extremities sometimes require surgical intervention to prevent deterioration of quality of life due to a pathological fracture. The use of localized radiotherapy combined with surgical reinforcement has been a gold standard for the treatment of bone metastases. However, radiotherapy sometimes induces soft tissue damage, including muscle induration and joint contracture. Moreover, cancer cells are not always radiosensitive. Hyperthermia has been studied since the 1940s using an experimental animal model to treat various types of advanced cancer, and studies have now reached the stage of clinical application, especially in conjunction with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Nevertheless, bone metastases have several special properties which discourage oncologists from developing hyperthermic therapeutic strategies. First, the bone is located deep in the body, and has low thermal conductivity due to the thickness of cortical bone and the highly vascularized medulla. To address these issues, we developed new hyperthermic strategies which generate heat using magnetic materials under an alternating electromagnetic field, and started clinical application of this treatment modality.

The incidence ranges up to 3% with a mortality rate up to 29%. In addition, postoperative infections after sternotomy are associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased healthcare costs and impaired quality of patient life, representing an economic and social burden. The emergence of increasing antimicrobial resistant bacteria augments the importance of postsurgical infections since the antimicrobial choices are becoming limited. Furthermore, the incidence of infection is an indicator for the quality of patient care in the international benchmark studies. Although several therapy strategies are nowadays present in clinical practice, there is a lack of evidence-based surgical consensus for treatment of this surgical complication. In most cases the poststernotomy mediastinitis involves surgical revision with debridement, open dressing and/or vacuum-assisted therapy. After the granulation tissue on open chest wound is achieved, secondary closure and/or reconstruction with vascularized soft tissue flaps, such as omentum or pectoral muscle is performed. It seems there is a need for more effective surgical treatment of poststernotomy wound infections, which may address the prolonged hospitalization and reduce the number of surgical interventions and with this also the perioperative morbidity.

In this study, a newly developed methodology was used to quantify the angiogenesis in the CAM under normal and early hypercapnic conditions (i.e., increased CO(2) concentrations). Two experiments were conducted in which the same CO(2) profile was applied. The development of the vascular system was monitored from embryonic day (ED) 10 until ED 14 in Experiment 1, and until ED 16 in Experiment 2.

Neurovascular structures are carefully dissected and preserved to ensure innervation and perfusion.\nEight patients underwent successful single-stage lower lip reconstruction with this technique. In three cases, bilateral extended Karapandzic flaps were used for total lower lip defects, and in five additional cases, unilateral extended Karapandzic flaps were combined with other local flaps for near-total defects. All patients achieved oral competence and normal or near-normal mouth opening. One patient developed a hematoma and one patient developed a fistula that healed with conservative treatment. There were no other complications.\nExtended Karapandzic flaps can be used to reconstruct near-total or total lower lip defects with innervated, well-vascularized tissues that recreate the oral sphincter and restore oral competence.

Three mice are implanted with a dorsal skin flap window chamber and injected with PC-3 prostate tumor cells transfected with green fluorescent protein. The ensuing tumor invasion is mapped during three weeks or more using simultaneous PA and PE imaging at 25 MHz, combined with optical and fluorescent techniques. Pulse echo imaging provides details of tumor structure and the surrounding environment with 100-\u03bcm(3) resolution.

Vascularization in vitro, also called prevascularization, is a promising method that could promote the vascularization of engineered adipose tissue constructs upon implantation. In this study we compared the ability of prevascularized-to-non-prevascularized fibrin-based human adipose tissue to promote vascularization. Human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and different mixtures (1:1, 1:2 and 1:5) of ASCs with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in fibrin at two different densities (1.0 \u00d7 10(6) and 10 \u00d7 10(6) cells/ml) for 7 days. Histological analysis revealed that prevascular structures formed in 1:5 ASC/HUVEC fibrin-based constructs seeded with a total of 10 \u00d7 10(6) cells/ml. These constructs and ASC-only constructs were implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice for 7 days and generated lipid-containing grafts. The numbers and densities of blood vessels within the ASC/HUVEC constructs were similar to those of ASC-only constructs. Furthermore, immunostaining studies demonstrated human-derived vasculature within a few of the ASC/HUVEC and ASC-only constructs. A subset of this human-derived vasculature contained erythrocytes, indicating integration with the host vasculature. In conclusion, our study indicated no difference in the rate of vascularization of prevascularized ASC/HUVEC and non-prevascularized ASC-only fibrin-based constructs, suggesting that prevascularization of these fibrin-based constructs does not promote vascularization. Our results further indicated that not only endothelial cells, but also ASCs may contribute to the formation of vascular lumina upon implantation. This finding is interesting, since it demonstrates the possibility of vascularized adipose tissue engineering from a single cell source.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-03-02", "authors": ["FemkeVerseijden", "Sandra JPosthumus-van Sluijs", "Johan Wvan Neck", "Stefan O PHofer", "Steven E RHovius", "Gerjo J V Mvan Osch"], "doi": "10.1002/term.410"}
{"title": "Vascularized fibula transfer for lower limb reconstruction.", "abstract": "Massive bony defects of the lower extremity are usually the result of high-energy trauma, tumor resection, or severe sepsis. Vascularized fibular grafts are useful in the reconstruction of large skeletal defects, especially in cases of scarred and avascular recipient sites, or in patients with combined bone and soft-tissue defects. Microvascular free fibula transfer is considered the most suitable autograft for reconstruction of the middle tibia because of its long cylindrical straight shape, mechanical strength, predictable vascular pedicle, and hypertrophy potential. The ability to fold the free fibula into two segments or to combine it with massive allografts is a useful technique for reconstruction of massive bone defects of the femur or proximal tibia. It can also be transferred with skin, fascia, or muscle as a composite flap. Proximal epiphyseal fibula transfer has the potential for longitudinal growth and can be used in the hip joint remodeling procedures. Complications can be minimized by careful preoperative planning of the procedure, meticulous intraoperative microsurgical techniques, and strict postoperative rehabilitation protocols.

Despite well-established bone-grafting techniques, large bone defects still represent a challenge. Efforts have therefore been made to develop osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic bone-replacement systems. The long-term clinical goal in bone tissue engineering is to reconstruct bony tissue in an anatomically functional three-dimensional morphology. Current bone tissue engineering strategies take into account that bone is known for its ability to regenerate following injury, and for its intrinsic capability to re-establish a complex hierarchical structure during regeneration. Although the tissue engineering of bone for the reconstruction of small to moderate sized bone defects technically feasible, the reconstruction of large defects remains a daunting challenge. The essential steps towards optimized clinical application of tissue-engineered bone are dependent upon recent advances in the area of neovascularization of the engineered construct. Despite these recent advances, however, a gap from bench to bedside remains; this may ultimately be bridged by a closer collaboration between basic scientists and reconstructive surgeons.

{"title": "An articular-based approach to Kienbock avascular necrosis of the lunate.", "abstract": "There are 3 pathologic phases of Kienbock disease: early vascular, intermediate osseous, and late chondral. Most of the earlier investigators have used Lichtman osseous radiologic classification. We have used an articular based approach to assess and manage Kienbock disease. The Bain and Begg arthroscopic classification is based on the number of nonfunctional articular surfaces of the lunate and adjacent articulations. The spectrum of articular changes span from grade 0, all normal articular surfaces; grade 1, involvement of the proximal lunate which is often soft and indentable with a false floor; grade 2a, lunate changes and secondary changes on the lunate facet; grade 2b, coronal lunate fracture produces involvement of the midcarpal joint; and grade 3s and 4, involvement of 3 and subsequently 4 of the perilunate articular surfaces. Arthroscopic findings have shown that radiographs often underestimate articular changes and frequently changed the treatment recommendation. Eighty-two percent of cases had at least 1 nonfunctional articulation, whereas 61% had at least 2 nonfunctional articulations. The aim of surgical treatment is to maintain functional motion with normal articulations. The articular-based classification directs treatment based on sound surgical principles. If all articular surfaces are intact, then a procedure that does not violate the articular surfaces is indicated (eg, synovectomy, vascularized bone graft, forage or joint leveling procedure). With nonfunctioning articular surfaces, an articular reconstructive procedure is required to leave the carpus mobile with only functional articular surfaces. (eg, proximal row carpectomy, radioscapholunate fusion, lunate replacement, or hemiarthroplasty). More extensive joint involvement requires a salvage procedure. This articular-based approach was developed for Kienbock disease but is universally applicable to all forms of avascular necrosis and can be used with advanced imaging modalities.", "journal": "Techniques in hand & upper extremity surgery", "date": "2011-03-02", "authors": ["Gregory IBain", "AdamDurrant"], "doi": "10.1097/BTH.0b013e31820e82e8"}

{"title": "Effect of VEGF trap on normal retinal vascular development and oxygen-induced retinopathy in the dog.", "abstract": "Purpose. To evaluate the effects of a vascular endothelial growth factor trap (VEGF Trap) on retinal vascular development and pathologic neovascularization (NV) in the canine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Methods. Newborn dogs (postnatal day [P]1) were exposed to 100% O(2) and then returned to room air on P5. VEGF Trap (5, 25, or 250 \u03bcg) was injected intravitreally in one eye and human FC (hFc) injected in the fellow eye of air control and oxygen-treated dogs on P8. The retinal vasculature and NV were evaluated on P21. Other oxygen-exposed animals received 5 \u03bcg of VEGF Trap or hFc on P22 after confirmation of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)-like pathology and were evaluated at P45. Results. In air controls, both the vascularized area of the retina and the density of superficial capillaries were reduced in 250 or 25 \u03bcg VEGF Trap-injected eyes, and deep capillaries were absent. Eyes that received the 5 \u03bcg dose were indistinguishable from controls. In oxygen-treated animals, all eyes injected with VEGF Trap exhibited markedly less intravitreal NV than that of hFc-injected fellow eyes, irrespective of dose. Retinal vascular area in OIR animals was significantly reduced in eyes injected with 250 or 25 \u03bcg of VEGF Trap, but the 5 \u03bcg dose did not inhibit retinal revascularization. Eyes with existing NV that received 5 \u03bcg VEGF Trap at P22 exhibited substantial resolution of OIR pathology at P45. Conclusions. The VEGF Trap inhibited the formation of NV, but higher doses also inhibited revascularization of retina when injected at P8. In contrast, the lowest dose tested effectively blocked NV and caused regression of existing NV, without appreciably affecting vasculogenesis or retinal revascularization.

The aim of this work was to validate different imaging parameters as individual or combined predictors of tumor necrosis after TAE in an orthotopic rat HCC tumor model.\nUnifocal rat HCC was imaged by T(2)-weighted MRI, quantitative dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) and [(18)F]-FDG PET imaging before (day-1) and after (days 1 and 3) TAE. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were carried out to analyze the ability of each imaging parameter to predict the percent residual vital tumor (vtu) and vital tissue (vti) as determined by quantitative histopathology.\nTAE induced a wide range of tumor necrosis. Tumor volume was the only parameter showing a correlation with vti (r(2) = 0.63) before TAE. After TAE, moderate correlations were found for FDG tracer uptake (r(2) = 0.56) and plasma tissue transfer constant (r(2) = 0.55). Correlations were higher for the extravascular extracellular volume fraction (v(e), r(2) = 0.68) and highest for the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, r(2) = 0.86).

Successful eradication may not occur without interposition of healthy vascularized tissue. Pedicled muscle flaps for coverage on the thorax have been well described. However, secondary to trauma or previous surgical procedures, a pedicle flap may not be sufficiently sized or available. Free tissue transfer is an attractive option to provide the appropriate vascularized tissue.\nSix patients with chronic empyema-bronchopleural fistulae were reconstructed with 4 rectus abdominis myocutaneous and 2 gracilis muscle flaps. The choice of recipient vessels was dictated by existing local anatomy but included intercostal, thoracodorsal, thoracoacromial, azygous, and circumflex humeral vessels. One flap required interposition saphenous vein grafts for both artery and vein.\nPatient follow-up ranged from 2 to 14 years. There were no episodes of flap loss or postoperative mortality. Empyema resolution without recurrent bronchopleural fistula was achieved in all patients.\nFree tissue transfer is an excellent option for vascularized tissue interposition in patients who are not candidates for pedicled muscle transfer.

{"title": "Akt3 controls vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and angiogenesis in ovarian cancer cells.", "abstract": "The PI3 kinase/Akt pathway is commonly deregulated in human cancers, functioning in such processes as proliferation, glucose metabolism, survival and motility. We have previously described a novel function for one of the Akt isoforms (Akt3) in primary endothelial cells: the control of VEGF-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. We sought to determine if Akt3 played a similar role in carcinoma cells. Because the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway has been strongly implicated as a key regulator in ovarian carcinoma, we tested the role of Akt3 in this tumor type. Silencing of Akt3 by shRNA did not cause an overt reduction in mitochondrial gene expression in a series of PTEN positive ovarian cancer cells. Rather, we find that blockade of Akt3, results in smaller, less vascularized tumors in a xenograft mouse model that is correlated with a reduction in VEGF expression. We find that blockade of Akt3, but not Akt1, results in a reduction in VEGF secretion and retention of VEGF protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The reduction in secretion under conditions of Akt3 blockade is, at least in part, due to the down regulation of the resident golgi protein and reported tumor cell marker, RCAS1. Conversely, over-expression of Akt3 results in an increase in RCAS1 expression and in VEGF secretion. Silencing of RCAS1 using siRNA inhibits VEGF secretion. These findings suggest an important role for Akt3 in the regulation of RCAS1 and VEGF secretion in ovarian cancer cells.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2011-02-26", "authors": ["Tiera ALiby", "PerrySpyropoulos", "HaleyBuff Lindner", "JuanitaEldridge", "CraigBeeson", "TienHsu", "Robin CMuise-Helmericks"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.26010"}

Nevertheless, the skin overlying the talar joint displayed necrosis. In order to cover the cutaneous defect, improve local vascularization, and allow reimplantation of the talus, a sural fasciocutaneous island flap was harvested. Subsequently, the original talus was placed and arthrodesis of the subtalar joint was performed. The patient was able to walk bearing full weight without support equipment after 6 months. Several therapeutic options have been suggested in such cases, including replacing the talus, tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis, and pseudoarthrodesis.

Recent reports have demonstrated a marked growth-promoting effect of total platelet extracts and selected platelet growth factors on therapeutic angiogenesis. However, since endogenous adenine nucleotides are rapidly degraded during the platelet isolation and storage, we examined whether supplementing a platelet-derived extract with exogenous adenine nucleotides would augment their pro-angiogenic effects.\nPulmonary artery vasa vasorum endothelial cells (VVEC) were used to examine the effects of dialyzed platelet-derived soluble extracts and extracellular adenine nucleotides on proliferation, migration and tube formation. In addition, an in vivo Matrigel plug assay was used to examine the effects of platelet extracts and adenine nucleotides on neovascularization of plugs subcutaneously placed in 50 ICR mice. The number of vascular structures in Matrigel plugs were evaluated by histological and statistical methods.\nPlatelet extracts (6.4-64 \u03bcg/ml) significantly induced DNA synthesis and at a concentration of 64 \u03bcg/ml had a biphasic effect on VVEC proliferation (an increase at 48 hrs followed by a decrease at 60 hrs). Stimulation of VVEC with platelet extracts also significantly (up to several-fold) increased cell migration and tube formation on Matrigel. Stimulation of VVEC with extracellular ATP (100 \u03bcM) dramatically (up to ten-fold) increased migration and tube formation on Matrigel; however, no significant effects on cell proliferation were observed. We also found that ATP moderately diminished platelet extract-induced VVEC proliferation (48 hrs) and migration, but potentiated tube formation. Neither ATP, or a mixture of non-hydrolyzable nucleotides (ATP\u03b3S, ADP\u03b2S, MeSATP, MeSADP) induced vascularization of Matrigel plugs subcutaneously injected in mice, however, the combination of these nucleotides with platelet extracts dramatically increased the number of functional capillaries in the Matrigel plugs.\nData from this study suggest that platelet-derived growth factors and extracellular nucleotides represent important regulatory signals for angiogenesis.

{"title": "Dual role of CO2/HCO3(-) buffer in the regulation of intracellular pH of three-dimensional tumor growths.", "abstract": "Intracellular pH (pH(i)), a major modulator of cell function, is regulated by acid/base transport across membranes. Excess intracellular H(+) ions (e.g. produced by respiration) are extruded by transporters such as Na(+)/H(+) exchange, or neutralized by HCO(3)(-) taken up by carriers such as Na(+)-HCO(3)(-) cotransport. Using fluorescence pH(i) imaging, we show that cancer-derived cell lines (colorectal HCT116 and HT29, breast MDA-MB-468, pancreatic MiaPaca2, and cervical HeLa) extrude acid by H(+) efflux and HCO(3)(-) influx, largely sensitive to dimethylamiloride and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS), respectively. The magnitude of HCO(3)(-) influx was comparable among the cell lines and may represent a constitutive element of tumor pH(i) regulation. In contrast, H(+) efflux varied considerably (MDA-MB-468 > HCT116 > HT29 > MiaPaca2 > HeLa). When HCO(3)(-) flux was pharmacologically inhibited, acid extrusion in multicellular HT29 and HCT116 spheroids (\u223c10,000 cells) was highly non-uniform and produced low pH(i) at the core. With depth, acid extrusion became relatively more DIDS-sensitive because the low extracellular pH at the spheroid core inhibits H(+) flux more than HCO(3)(-) flux. HCO(3)(-) flux inhibition also decelerated HCT116 spheroid growth. In the absence of CO(2)/HCO(3)(-), acid extrusion by H(+) flux in HCT116 and MDA-MB-468 spheroids became highly non-uniform and inadequate at the core. This is because H(+) transporters require extracellular mobile pH buffers, such as CO(2)/HCO(3)(-), to overcome low H(+) ion mobility and chaperone H(+) ions away from cells. CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) exerts a dual effect: as substrate for membrane-bound HCO(3)(-) transporters and as a mobile buffer for facilitating extracellular diffusion of H(+) ions extruded from cells. These processes can be augmented by carbonic anhydrase activity. We conclude that CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) is important for maintaining uniformly alkaline pH(i) in small, non-vascularized tumor growths and may be important for cancer disease progression.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2011-02-25", "authors": ["AlzbetaHulikova", "Richard DVaughan-Jones", "PawelSwietach"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M111.219899"}

{"title": "Direct anti-cancer effect of oncostatin M on chondrosarcoma.", "abstract": "The cytokine Oncostatin M (OSM) is cytostatic, pro-apoptotic and induces differentiation of osteosarcoma cells into osteocytes, suggesting new adjuvant treatment for these bone-forming sarcomas. However, OSM systemic over-expression could lead to adverse side effects such as generalized inflammation, neoangiogenesis and osteolysis. We determine here the effect of OSM on chondrosarcoma, another primary bone sarcoma characterized by the production of cartilage matrix and altered bone remodelling. Chondrosarcomas are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and wide surgical excision remains the only available treatment. We found that OSM blocked the cell cycle in four of five chondrosarcoma cell lines, independently of p53 and presumably through the JAK3/STAT1 pathway. In two tested cell lines, OSM induced a hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, with an induced Cbfa1/SOX9 ratio and induced Coll10, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and RANKL expression. Adenoviral gene transfer of OSM (AdOSM) in the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma (SRC) model indicated that local intra-tumoral OSM over-expression reduces chondrosarcoma development not only with reduced tumor proliferation and enhanced apoptosis but also with enhanced RANKL expression, osteoclast formation and reduced bone volumes. Flu-like symptoms were induced by the AdOSM, but there was no effect on tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, OSM could be considered as a new adjuvant anti-cancer agent for chondrosarcomas. A local application of this cytokine is presumably needed to overcome the poor vascularization of these tumors and to limit the deleterious effect on other tissues.

A mechanical stimulator was developed to generate a periodic compressive load analogous to goat locomotor characteristics, simulating the mechanical stimulation applied on the fracture ends of the load-bearing bone. Poly-l-lysine-coated VEGF/alginate microspheres were combined with demineralized bone matrices into composites, and the in vitro release of VEGF from these composites was evaluated under periodic compression. The effect of the release media on HUVECs was also investigated. Compression slightly accelerated VEGF release at the early stage (<11 days) compared with noncompressed composites, although the release profiles of the two composite groups were generally similar. The released VEGF promoted HUVEC proliferation. In addition, the periodic compression applied on composites containing both HUVECs and VEGF/alginate microspheres promoted the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 in HUVECs.

Furthermore, in addition to the recently described lack of Treg, CCR7(-/-) mice were found to harbor significantly reduced numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) within peripheral as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs), but not the bone marrow or spleen. pDCs had previously been suggested to function as tolerogenic APC during allograft transplantation, and a single transfer of syngeneic WT pDCs, but not conventional DCs, was indeed sufficient to rescue graft survival in DST+CSB-treated CCR7(-/-) recipients in a dose-dependent manner.

They are regarded as having a strong association with the clinical symptom of low back pain (LBP). Nevertheless, the general pathogenesis of MCs is still under discussion. MCs can be divided into three types. Type I MCs represent extensive subchondral bone edema and vascular granulation tissue within the bone marrow of the adjacent endplate. The reasons for the edema and vascularization in Type I MCs, which may be the major mechanism underlying LBP, remain unclear. Chronic repetitive shear forces on the endplates lead to local disruption and microfractures. Following a breach of the outer annulus fibrous, the nucleus pulposus (NP) may enter the vertebral body. We hypothesize that the consequent autoimmune response due to a foreign body may cause and promote the development of edema, vascularization and inflammation, which are characteristic of Type I MCs. The production of cytokines evoked by autoimmunity could therefore be responsible for the significant clinical symptoms of LBP.

Exogenous fibrin with extra cellular matrix (ECM) components can also favor the wound healing process. In a preliminary study we found that lyophilized fibrin sheet (FS) arrest bleeding from rabbit skin wound but it remained dry during the repair period and did not accelerate the healing process better than untreated control. In the current study, hyaluronic acid (HA) was incorporated into FS and the resultant HA-FS promoted water retention and improved wound healing process. Gross-morphology, histopathology and histomorphometry were employed to compare qualitative and quantitative difference of wound healing in treated group against controls. In experimental sites (HA-FS), re-epithelialization was completed by 14 days with neo-vascularization and deposition of wavy bundles of collagen in the treated sites. Rate of healing process was different in treated and untreated wounds and most striking difference was the appearance of appendages, sebaceous gland and hair follicle at some locations in HA-FS treated sites. Therefore, HA with fibrin can create an effective wound care matrix which promotes water retention and wound healing potential.", "journal": "Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization", "date": "2011-02-22", "authors": ["T VAnilkumar", "JaseerMuhamed", "AnumolJose", "ArunJyothi", "P VMohanan", "Lissy KKrishnan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biologicals.2011.01.003"}

{"title": "Targeting the unfolded protein response in cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Rapid growth of tumor cells coupled with inadequate vascularization leads to shortage of oxygen and nutrients. The unfolded protein response (UPR), a defense cellular mechanism activated during such stress conditions, is a complex process that includes upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Due to its central role in UPR, GRP78 is overexpressed in many cancers; it is implicated in cancer cell survival through supporting of drug- and radioresistance as well as metastatic dissemination, and is generally associated with poor outcome. This is the reason why selective destruction of GRP78 could become a novel anticancer strategy. GRP78 is the only known substrate of the proteolytic A subunit (SubA) of a bacterial AB(5) toxin, and the selective SubA-induced cleavage of GRP78 leads to massive cell death. Targeted delivery of SubA into cancer cells via specific receptor-mediated endocytosis could be a suitable strategy for assaulting tumor cells. We fused SubA to epidermal growth factor (EGF), whose receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells, and demonstrated that the resulting EGF-SubA immunotoxin is an effective killer of EGFR-positive tumor cells. Furthermore, because of its unique mechanism of action, EGF-SubA synergizes with UPR-inducing drugs, which opens a possibility for the development of mechanism-based combination regimens for effective anticancer therapy. In this chapter, we provide experimental protocols for the assessment of the effects of EGF-SubA on EGFR-positive cancer cells, either alone or in combination with UPR-inducing drugs.", "journal": "Methods in enzymology", "date": "2011-02-19", "authors": ["Marina VBacker", "Joseph MBacker", "PrakashChinnaiyan"], "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-385928-0.00003-1"}

We have used artificial ECMs based on photocrosslinkable RGD-alginate to investigate the adipogenic and pro-angiogenic potential of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as a function of matrix stiffness. These hydrogels allowed us to decouple matrix stiffness from changes in adhesion peptide density or extracellular Ca(2+) concentration and provided a physiologically relevant 3D culture context.

{"title": "Adipose tissue vascularization: its role in chronic inflammation.", "abstract": "In obesity, the vascular complication is a result of insulin resistance, such as decreased capillary recruitment in skeletal muscle from endothelial insulin resistance. Recent progress in the study of obesity-associated inflammation suggests that vasculature dysfunction occurs in adipose tissue before insulin resistance. In obesity, capillary density and function fail to meet the demand of adipose tissue growth. The failure leads to microcirculation dysfunction from an impaired blood perfusion, which results in a local hypoxia response in adipose tissue. The hypoxia response in adipocytes and macrophages is a new cellular basis for the chronic inflammation. The obesity-associated inflammation has both positive and negative effects in the body. At the early stage, it amplifies the hypoxia signal to stimulate vasculature remodeling locally, and promotes systemic energy expenditure against obesity. At the late stage, it causes adipose tissue dysfunction for insulin resistance. These points suggest that in obesity, adipose tissue vascularization controls chronic inflammation and influences systemic insulin sensitivity.", "journal": "Current diabetes reports", "date": "2011-02-18", "authors": ["JianpingYe"], "doi": "10.1007/s11892-011-0183-1"}

Multivariate risk factors influencing failure of first grafts for keratoconus included time to suture removal, postgraft uveitis or microbial keratitis, corneal vascularization prior to or after graft, geographic location of surgery and follow-up (center effect), recipient age at graft, occurrence of rejection episodes, graft size, and surgeon workload. The timing of bilateral grafts made no difference to the risk of rejection. A Snellen visual acuity of 20/40 or better at the most recent follow-up was recorded in 74% of grafts.\nPenetrating grafts performed for keratoconus exhibited better visual outcome and graft survival than grafts performed for other indications.

However, the cellular organization within biodegradable scaffolds often does not resemble those of native tissues. In this study, we present directed assembly of microgels to organize cells for building porous 3D tissue constructs. Cell-laden microgels were generated by molding photocrosslinkable polyethylene glycol diacrylate within a poly(dimethyl siloxane) stencil. The resulting microgels were subsequently packed as individual layers (1 mm in height) on a glass substrate by removing the excess prepolymer solution around the microgels. These clusters were crosslinked and stacked on one another to fabricate thick 3D constructs that were greater than 1 cm in width and 3 mm in thickness. To generate pores within the engineered structures, sodium alginate microgels were integrated in the engineered constructs and used as a sacrificial template. These pores may be potentially useful for fabricating a vascular network to supply oxygen and nutrients to the engineered tissue constructs. This simple and versatile building approach may be a useful tool for various 3D tissue culture and engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Ovine cortical osteoblasts outperform bone marrow cells in an ectopic bone assay.", "abstract": "Reviewing the available literature, one could conclude that marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are the 'gold standard' source for bone tissue engineering applications, due to their multilineage differentiation potential and easy accessibility. However, comprehensive studies comparing their osteogenic potential with bone-derived osteoblasts (OBs) to justify the preferred application of BMSCs based on performance are few. To address these shortfalls, in the present study, ovine BMSCs and OBs seeded onto scaffolds were characterized in vitro and transplanted subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice in combination with and without recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 (rhBMP-7). It was hypothesized that cell origin, ossification type and degree of vascularization and ossification depends on the nature and commitment of transplanted cells and stimulating growth factors, such as rhBMP-7. After retrieval, specimens were analysed by biomechanical testing, \u00b5CT analysis, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and histo- and immunohistochemistry for osteocalcin, type II collagen and BrdU. The results showed a high degree of cell survival and proliferation ectopically, resulting in active contribution to endochondral osteogenesis. When compared to BMSCs, OBs showed a higher degree of bone deposition while OB-derived bone was of higher maturation. Stimulation with rhBMP-7 increased the rate of bone synthesis for both BMSCs and OBs, additionally promoting neovascularization and osteoclast activity. These results suggest that the origin and commitment of transplanted cells highly influence the type and degree of ossification, that rhBMP-7 represents a powerful adjuvant for bone tissue-engineering applications, and that mature bone is an adequate alternative cell source for bone tissue-engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-02-12", "authors": ["J CReichert", "V M CQuent", "UN\u00f6th", "D WHutmacher"], "doi": "10.1002/term.392"}

Although local, distant, and free tissue transfer or bone grafting alone may be adequate for repair of small wounds or osseous defects, large or complicated defects necessitate a different approach. The authors describe their experience with free tissue transfer in combination with distraction osteogenesis for complex composite osteocutaneous defects.\nThe authors reviewed a consecutive series of 28 patients who underwent treatment over an 8-year period, with follow-up ranging from 1 to 8.5 years. Mean time to flap after injury was 1082 days (range, 6 days to 30 years). Indications for treatment included infected nonunion of the tibia (n = 18), acute traumatic bone loss (n = 5), skin and soft-tissue breakdown that occurred during distraction osteogenesis (n = 4), and exposed bone following previous failed free flap (n = 1).\nFree flaps used included the rectus abdominis (n = 17), latissimus dorsi (n = 5), gracilis (n = 5), and radial forearm (n = 1). Mean length of bone gap was 63 mm (range, 30 to 140 mm), and mean area of wound requiring flap coverage was 219 cm (range, 35 to 400 cm). Twenty-five patients (89.3 percent) had successful flap coverage and went on to ambulate independently and return to work. The minor complication rate was 42.9 percent.\nDistraction osteogenesis in combination with free tissue transfer is a powerful technique that allows limb salvage, particularly when local and regional flaps are unavailable or inadequate.

Using image fusion, regions of interest were drawn around the tumours and the entire liver, and the tumour-to-liver quotient was calculated. In addition, FDG PET/CT was performed at baseline and 3 months after radioembolization, and the percentage changes in peak (\u0394SUV(max)) and mean (\u0394SUV(mean)) FDG uptake and in metabolic tumour volume (\u0394Vol(2SD)) relative to baseline were calculated. Treatment response at 3 months was also assessed using contrast-enhanced MRI and CT on the basis of standard criteria.\nOf 23 patients in whom follow-up MRI was available, 5 (22%) showed a partial response, 15 (65%) stable disease and 3 (13%) progressive disease. The change in all FDG values significantly predicted survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis after radioembolization; \u0394Vol(2SD) responders had a median survival of 97 weeks versus 30 weeks in nonresponders (P = 0.02), whereas \u0394SUV(max) and \u0394SUV(mean) responders had a median survival of 114 weeks (responder) versus 19 weeks (nonresponder) and 69 weeks in patients with stable disease (P < 0.05). Pretherapeutic MAA scintigraphy or MRI did not predict survival, nor did the presence of extrahepatic metastases, or prior therapies. Only \u0394Vol(2SD) was significantly associated with survival by univariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.25; P = 0.04) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.20, P = 0.04).\nFDG PET/CT was able to predict patient outcome after radioembolization treatment, with the change in metabolically active tumour volume at 3 months being the best independent predictor. High tumour vascularization, as indicated by MAA scintigraphy, was not a prerequisite for successful radioembolization and was even associated with a tendency towards shorter survival.", "journal": "European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging", "date": "2011-02-11", "authors": ["Alexander RHaug", "VolkerHeinemann", "Christiane JBruns", "RalfHoffmann", "TobiasJakobs", "PeterBartenstein", "MarcusHacker"], "doi": "10.1007/s00259-011-1736-x"}
{"title": "Contrast enhanced vessel imaging using microCT.", "abstract": "Microscopic computed tomography (microCT) offers high-resolution volumetric imaging of the anatomy of living small animals. However, the contrast between different soft tissues and body fluids is inherently poor in micro-CT images (1). Under these circumstances, visualization of blood vessels becomes a nearly impossible task. To overcome this and to improve the visualization of blood vessels exogenous contrast agents can be used. Herein, we present a methodology for visualizing the vascular network in a rodent model. By using a long-acting aqueous colloidal polydisperse iodinated blood-pool contrast agent, eXIA 160XL, we optimized image acquisition parameters and volume-rendering techniques for finding blood vessels in live animals. Our findings suggest that, to achieve a superior contrast between bone and soft tissue from vessel, multiple-frames (at least 5-8/ frames per view), and 360-720 views (for a full 360\u00b0 rotation) acquisitions were mandatory. We have also demonstrated the use of a two-dimensional transfer function (where voxel color and opacity was assigned in proportion to CT value and gradient magnitude), in visualizing the anatomy and highlighting the structure of interest, the blood vessel network.

Cell-based therapies using expanded DPCs for hair regeneration have been unsuccessful in humans. Two major challenges remain: first, expanded DPCs obtained from adult hair follicles have functional limitations; second, a clinically applicable method is needed for transplanting DPCs. This study aimed to identify an efficient, minimally invasive and economical DPC transplantation procedure for use in clinical settings. Five clinically applicable transplantation procedures were tested, termed the Pinhole, Laser, Slit, Non-vascularized sandwich (NVS) and Hemi-vascularized sandwich (HVS) methods. Labelled rat dermal papilla tissue was transplanted into rat sole skin, and hair follicle regeneration was evaluated histologically. Regenerated follicles and labelled DPCs were detected for all methods, although some follicles showed abnormal growth, i.e. a cystic or inverted appearance. The HVS method, pioneered here, resulted in significantly larger number of regenerated follicles that were more mature and regular than those observed using the other methods. Moreover, hair growth was detected after expanded adult-derived DPC transplantation using the HVS method.

In this study, we found that a two-dimensional co-culture of human bone marrow stromal cell (HBMSC) and human umbical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) is able to stimulate the migration of co-cultured HUVEC and induce self-assembled network formation. During this process, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085) was upregulated in co-cultured HBMSC. Meanwhile, VEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085-receptor2 (KDR) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) were upregulated in co-cultured HUVEC. Functional studies show that neutralization of VEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085 blocked the migration and the rearrangement of the cells and downregulated the expression of uPA and its receptor. Blocking of vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cad) did not affect the migration of co-cultured HUVEC but suppressed the self-assembled network formation. In conclusion, co-cultures upregulated the expression of VEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085 in co-cultured HBMSC; VEGF\u2081\u2086\u2085 then activated uPA in co-cultured HUVEC, which might be responsible for initiating the migration and the self-assembled network formation with the participation of VE-cad.

{"title": "2'-hydroxyflavanone inhibits proliferation, tumor vascularization and promotes normal differentiation in VHL-mutant renal cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the top ten cancers prevalent in USA. Loss-of-function mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene constitute an established risk factor contributing to 75% of total reported cases of RCC. Loss-of-VHL leads to a highly vascularized phenotype of renal tumors. Intake of citrus fruits has been proven to reduce the risk of RCC in multicenter international studies. Hence, we studied the effect of 2'-hydroxyflavanone (2HF), an active anticancer compound from oranges, in RCC. Our in vitro investigations revealed that 2HF suppresses VHL-mutant RCC to a significantly greater extent than VHL-wild-type RCC by inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, which is increased due to VHL mutations in RCC. Our results also revealed for the first time, that 2HF inhibits glutathione S-transferase pi activity. 2HF reduced cyclin B1 and CDK4 levels and induced G2/M phase arrest in VHL-mutant RCC. Importantly, 2HF inhibited the angiogenesis in VHL-mutant RCC by decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Our in vivo studies in mice xenografts confirmed our in vitro results as evident by decreased levels of proliferation marker, Ki67 and angiogenic marker, CD31, in 2HF-treated mice xenografts of VHL-mutant RCC. 2HF also increased the expression of E-cadherin in VHL-mutant RCC, which would be of significance in restoring normal epithelial phenotype. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo results revealed the potent antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic and prodifferentiation properties of 2HF in VHL-mutant RCC, sparing normal cells, which could have significant implications not only in the specific management of VHL-mutant RCC but also towards other VHL syndromes.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2011-02-10", "authors": ["Lokesh DalasanurNagaprashantha", "RitVatsyayan", "JyotsanaSinghal", "PoornaLelsani", "LaszloProkai", "SanjayAwasthi", "Sharad SSinghal"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgr021"}

Through proteolysis of inhibitory IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), PAPP-A acts as a positive modulator of local IGF signaling in a variety of biological systems. A role of IGF in the progression of several common forms of human cancer is now emerging, and therapeutic intervention of IGF receptor signaling is currently being explored. However, little is known about the activities of other components of the IGF system in relation to cancer. We hypothesized that PAPP-A acts to enhance tumor growth in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed wild-type PAPP-A or a mutant PAPP-A with markedly reduced IGFBP protease activity in SKOV3 cells, a human ovarian carcinoma cell line with low tumorigenic potential. In vitro, SKOV3 clones with elevated PAPP-A expression (PAPP-A-1, PAPP-A-28) showed accelerated anchorage-independent growth in soft agar assays compared to clones overexpressing mutant PAPP-A (E483Q-1, E483Q-5) and vector controls. PAPP-A-28, with the highest PAPP-A expression and IGFBP proteolytic activity, also had markedly increased cell invasion through Matrigel. In vivo, we found significantly accelerated tumor growth rates of PAPP-A-overexpressing SKOV3 clones compared with mutant PAPP-A and controls. Investigation of angiogenesis indicated that overexpression of PAPP-A favored development of mature tumor vasculature and that tumor precursors of PAPP-A-28 in particular had a significantly higher degree of vascularization months before obvious tumor development. In conclusion, our data show that PAPP-A proteolytic activity enhances the tumorigenic potential of ovarian cancer cells and establish a novel tumor growth-promoting role of PAPP-A.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2011-02-10", "authors": ["Henning BBoldt", "Cheryl AConover"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2010-1095"}

Recently, the role of blood vessels in the maintenance and functioning of neurogenic niches during development and in adult life has been hallmarked. In addition to their trophic support for the highly demanding neurogenic process, blood vessels regulate neuroblast differentiation and migration and define functional domains. Since neurogenesis along the forebrain neurogenic niche (FNN) is a multistage process, in which neuroblast proliferation, differentiation and migration are spatially restricted to specific locations; we evaluated the structural features of vascular beds that support these processes during critical time points in their development. Additionally, we studied the molecular identity of the endothelial components of vascular beds using the expression of the venous marker EphB4. Our results show that blood vessels along the FNN: 1) are present very early in development; 2) define the borders of the FNN since early developmental stages; 3) experience constant remodeling until achieving their mature structure; 4) show venous features during perinatal developmental times; and 5) down-regulate their EphB4 expression as development proceeds.

In vivo canine model.\nThe length and volume of test flaps harvested in six adult human cadaveric larynges were analyzed to determine suitability for use in augmentation in the lamina propria. Also, 12 beagles randomly underwent unilateral placement of either TAP or CTAP, which were designed in accordance with the human adult cadaveric experiments. Flap perfusion was measured before and after harvest with laser Doppler. After 1 month, the beagles were humanely sacrificed and their larynges subjected to aerodynamic and acoustic evaluation using an excised larynx apparatus. The vocal fold lamina propria of four larynges--two TAP and two CTAP--underwent rheologic evaluation using a simple-shear rheometer. The remaining eight larynges underwent quantitative histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The survival and complication (swallowing, airway, local wound) rates of all dogs were noted.\nInitial studies with adult human cadaveric larynges established that TAP and CTAP possessed length and volume greater than native lamina propria. In the canine experiments, the perfusion change in the flaps was similar between flap groups. The damping ratio (\u03b6), dynamic viscosity (\u03b7'), elastic shear modulus (G'), and viscous shear modulus (G\u2033) of treated and untreated native vocal folds were not statistically different. The glottic function measures of vocal efficiency, laryngeal resistance, jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) of treated and normal larynges were not statistically different. Similarly, the values for collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in treated and untreated vocal folds were not statistically different. Also, neither neochrondrogenesis nor neoosteogenesis was detected in any treated vocal fold.

{"title": "Paternal MHC expression on mouse trophoblast affects uterine vascularization and fetal growth.", "abstract": "The mammalian fetus represents a semiallograft within the maternal uterus yet is not rejected. This situation is particularly pronounced in species with a hemochorial type of placentation, such as humans and rodents, where maternal tissues and blood are in direct contact with fetal trophoblast and thus potentially with paternal antigens. The main polymorphic antigens responsible for graft rejection are MHC antigens. In humans the trophoblast cells invading into the decidua have a unique pattern of MHC class I expression characterized by both classical (HLA-C) and nonclassical (HLA-G and HLA-E) molecules. Whether such an unusual MHC repertoire on the surface of trophoblast is a conserved feature between species with hemochorial placentation has not been resolved. Here we demonstrate, using a range of methods, that C57BL/6 mouse trophoblast predominantly expresses only one MHC class I antigen, H2-K, at the cell surface of giant cells but lacks expression of nonclassical MHC molecules. Antigenic disparity between parental MHCs affects trophoblast-induced transformation of the uterine vasculature and, consequently, placental and fetal gowth.

{"title": "Down-regulation of miR-101 in endothelial cells promotes blood vessel formation through reduced repression of EZH2.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a balanced process controlled by pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules of which the regulation is not fully understood. Besides classical gene regulation, miRNAs have emerged as post-transcriptional regulators of angiogenesis. Furthermore, epigenetic changes caused by histone-modifying enzymes were shown to modulate angiogenesis as well. However, a possible interplay between miRNAs and histone-modulating enzymes during angiogenesis has not been described. Here we show that VEGF-mediated down-regulation of miR-101 caused pro-angiogenic effects. We found that the pro-angiogenic effects are partly mediated through reduced repression by miR-101 of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2, a member of the Polycomb group family, thereby increasing methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 and transcriptome alterations. In vitro, the sprouting and migratory properties of primary endothelial cell cultures were reduced by inhibiting EZH2 through up-regulation of miR-101, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2, or treatment with 3-Deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), a small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity. In addition, we found that systemic DZNep administration reduced the number of blood vessels in a subcutaneous glioblastoma mouse model, without showing adverse toxicities. Altogether, by identifying a pro-angiogenic VEGF/miR-101/EZH2 axis in endothelial cells we provide evidence for a functional link between growth factor-mediated signaling, post-transcriptional silencing, and histone-methylation in the angiogenesis process.

The arterialization of the superficial venous system, which consists in redirecting the arterial flow to the fingertip through the dorsal venous system, could be an interesting alternative to the disappointing results of medical therapy and surgical sympathectomy. The authors present here the preliminary results of this technique.\nWe carried out a retrospective study analyzing the indications, the operative technique and results of three hands operated on two patients. An arteriography was carried out on each patient prior to perform the arterialization of the superficial venous system, in order to make sure that none of the patients was eligible for a technique of direct re-vascularization.\nPostoperatively, for each patient, the following points were evaluated: pain reduction, ulcer healing, and then we tried to obtain a more objective assessment by performing angio-MRI.\nThis last resort technique in management of critical ischemia of the fingers led to an immediate and lasting improvement of symptoms in all the patients treated.

{"title": "Building stable chains with motile agents: Insights into the morphology of enteric neural crest cell migration.", "abstract": "A defining characteristic of the normal development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) is the existence of an enteric neural crest (ENC) cell colonization wave, where the ENC cells form stable chains often associated with axons and near the vascular network. However, within this evolving neural network, the individual ENC cell elements constantly move, change direction and appear to act independently of neighbors. Three possible hypotheses are investigated. The simplest of these postulates that the ENS follows the vascular network as a template. We present evidence which does not support this hypothesis. Two viable alternatives are either that (i) the axons muster the ENC cells, providing the pattern for the chain migration or (ii) ENC cells form chains and the axons follow these paths. These two hypotheses are explored by developing a stochastic cellular automata model, where ENC agents follow simple rules, which reflect the underlying biology of movement, proliferation and differentiation. By simulating ENC precursors and the associated neurons and axons, two models with different fundamental mechanisms are developed. From local rules, a mesoscale network pattern with lacunae emerges, which can be analyzed quantitatively. Simulation and analysis establishes the parameters that affect the morphology of the resulting network.

{"title": "Fibulin-5 expression in the human placenta.", "abstract": "Fibulin-5 is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein and displays a diverse panel of biological functions, which can be segregated into elastogenic as well as extra-elastogenic functions. While elastogenic functions of fibulin-5 include essential roles in early steps of elastic fibre assembly, extra-elastogenic functions are widespread. Depending on the cell type used, fibulin-5 mediates cell adherence via a subset of integrins, antagonizes angiogenesis and inhibits migration as well as proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In this study, we focused on the spatiotemporal expression of fibulin-5 in the human placenta. With progressing gestation, placental fibulin-5 expression increased from first trimester towards term. At term, placental fibulin-5 mRNA expression is lower when compared with other well-vascularized organs such as lung, kidney, heart, uterus and testis. In first trimester, placenta immunohistochemistry localized fibulin-5 in villous cytotrophoblasts and extravillous cytotrophoblasts of the proximal cell column. In term placenta, fibulin-5 was detected in the endothelial basement membrane and adventitia-like regions of vessels in the chorionic plate and stem villi. Cell culture experiments with the villous trophoblast-derived cell line BeWo showed that fibulin-5 expression was downregulated during functional differentiation and intercellular fusion. Moreover, cultivation of BeWo cells under low oxygen conditions impaired intercellular fusion and upregulated fibulin-5 expression.

Although other embryonic tissues undergo primary vascularization, the developing nervous system is unique in that it is secondarily vascularized by sprouting angiogenesis from a surrounding perineural plexus. This sprouting angiogenesis requires the TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt pathways because ablation of these pathways results in aberrant sprouting and hemorrhage. We have genetically deleted Gpr124, a member of the large family of long N-terminal group B G protein-coupled receptors, few members of which have identified ligands or well-defined biologic functions in mammals. We show that, in the developing CNS, Gpr124 is specifically expressed in the vasculature and is absolutely required for proper angiogenic sprouting into the developing neural tube. Embryos lacking Gpr124 exhibit vascular defects characterized by delayed vascular penetration, formation of pathological glomeruloid tufts within the CNS, and hemorrhage. In addition, they display defects in palate and lung development, two processes in which TGF-\u03b2 and/or Wnt pathways also play important roles. We also show that TGF-\u03b2 stimulates Gpr124 expression, and ablation of Gpr124 results in perturbed TGF-\u03b2 pathway activation, suggesting roles for Gpr124 in modulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the usefulness of this graft material.\nUsing myofascial flaps from the pectoralis major muscle in 15 patients and from the platysma muscle in 11 patients, several types of reconstructive procedures were conducted in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Wakayama Medical University.\nMyofascial tissue was used to cover the surgical defect and for regeneration of oral mucosa (24 patients), to prevent exposure of the mandibular reconstruction plate (4 patients), for prevention of wound breakdown and secondary infection in the oral cavity (2 patients), for vascularized coverage of free grafted autologous bone (2 patients), and for protection of large vessels after radical neck dissection (9 patients). Although partial flap necrosis or wound dehiscence was noticed in 3 patients with a platysma-myofascial graft, the healing process of all patients was favorable and required no additional operations. This procedure is most suitable for the reconstruction of small to medium-sized soft tissue defects in the oral cavity, because it induces the formation of nearly normal mucosa through epithelial regeneration without clear scar formation.\nMyofascial flap is a useful option in certain oral and maxillofacial reconstruction cases in which mucosal regeneration and/or vascularized soft tissue coverage are required.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2011-02-01", "authors": ["TakeshiWada", "KenNakatani", "YukihiroHiraishi", "KenjiNegoro", "YoshinobuIwagami", "ShigeyukiFujita"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2010.07.069"}

For Embozene, the vessel diameter was not significantly different between the two sizes, for each organ, whereas it was significantly larger for Embosphere 700-900 \u03bcm than for Embosphere 500-700 \u03bcm in each organ. Embozene deformation was significantly higher than that of Embosphere in renal and uterine vasculature, increased from proximal to distal in location for both organs and correlated negatively with vessel diameter (Rho = -0.623; P < .0001). Embosphere deformation did not vary according to the zone.\nEmbozene microspheres have a higher in vivo deformation, which results in a more distal occlusion within the vascular network compared with reference Embosphere microspheres. The diameter of occluded vessels varied for the tested size range for Embosphere but was independent of the tested microsphere size range used for Embozene.

These strategies have, however, in many cases failed to produce the desired results due to issues such as the immunogenicity of the biomaterials used and cell necrosis at the bulk of the scaffold related to deficient oxygen and nutrients diffusion. Here, we originally propose the use of cell sheet (CS) engineering as a possible way to overcome some of these obstacles. Osteogenic CSs were fabricated by culturing rat bone marrow stromal cells in thermoresponsive culture dishes. The CSs were recovered from the dishes using a low-temperature treatment and then were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice. New bone formation was verified from day 7 post-transplantation using X-ray, microcomputed tomography, and histological analysis. The presence of a vascularized marrow was also verified in the newly formed bone after 6 weeks of transplantation. Further, osteocytes were found in this newly formed tissue, supporting the conclusion that mature bone was formed after ectopically transplanting osteogenic CSs. These results therefore confirm the great potentiality of CS engineering to be used in bone tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Regional differences in vascular density can be detected using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, inhomogeneities in vascularization might help to identify anatomically distinct areas noninvasively in vivo. It was reported previously that cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs in the striate cortex of squirrel monkeys are characterized by a notably higher vascular density (42% higher than interblob regions). However, blobs have so far never been identified in vivo on the basis of their vascular density. Here, we analyzed blobs of the primary visual cortex of squirrel monkeys and macaques with respect to the relationship between vascularization and cytochrome oxidase activity. By double staining with cytochrome oxidase enzyme histochemistry to define the blobs and collagen type IV immunohistochemistry to quantify the blood vessels, a close correlation between oxidative metabolism and vascularization was confirmed and quantified in detail. The vascular length density in cytochrome oxidase blobs was on average 4.5% higher than in the interblob regions, a difference almost one order of magnitude smaller than previously reported. Thus, the vascular density that is closely associated with local average metabolic activity is a structural equivalent of cerebral metabolism and blood flow.

Here, we propose that using soluble phosphate glass (SPG) fibers, incorporated in dense collagen constructs will allow us to control the rate and direction of tissue ingrowth. The idea here was to generate channels with tailored direction using conical phosphate glass fibers. The changing surface area-to-mass ratio of conical fibers will make them to dissolve faster from their narrow ends opening up channels in that direction ahead of any ingrowing cells. In this study, we show that SPG fibers can be manipulated to produce conical shape fibers using graded dissolution.

The ability to tune the degradation properties of naturally derived biomaterials has been a popular goal in tissue engineering, yet has often depended on chemical crosslinking. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally derived, collagen-based, bioactive scaffold that has broad clinical success in many therapeutic applications. Two methods for producing multilayer, non-crosslinked SIS constructs were compared in vitro and in vivo. Traditional and cryo SEM, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and a novel enzymatic degradation assay determined that lyophilization produced an open, porous scaffold, in contrast to the collapsed, denser structure of SIS constructs produced using a vacuum press process. The angiogenic responses to lyophilized and vacuum-pressed SIS constructs were evaluated in vivo using a subcutaneous implant assay in mice. Explanted samples were compared after 7 and 21 days using fluorescence microangiography and light microscopy. Capacity of the implant neovasculature was also determined.

{"title": "Evolution of the VEGF-regulated vascular network from a neural guidance system.", "abstract": "The vascular network is closely linked to the neural system, and an interdependence is displayed in healthy and in pathophysiological responses. How has close apposition of two such functionally different systems occurred? Here, we present a hypothesis for the evolution of the vascular network from an ancestral neural guidance system. Biological cornerstones of this hypothesis are the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein family and cognate receptors. The primary sequences of such proteins are conserved from invertebrates, such as worms and flies that lack discernible vascular systems compared to mammals, but all these systems have sophisticated neuronal wiring involving such molecules. Ancestral VEGFs and receptors (VEGFRs) could have been used to develop and maintain the nervous system in primitive eukaryotes. During evolution, the demands of increased morphological complexity required systems for transporting molecules and cells, i.e., biological conductive tubes. We propose that the VEGF-VEGFR axis was subverted by evolution to mediate the formation of biological tubes necessary for transport of fluids, e.g., blood. Increasingly, there is evidence that aberrant VEGF-mediated responses are also linked to neuronal dysfunctions ranging from motor neuron disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ischemic brain disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and neuronal repair after injury, as well as common vascular diseases (e.g., retinal disease).

Therefore, we evaluated whether OSCC-associated myofibroblasts have different characteristics compared to OSCC-associated fibroblasts. OSCC myofibroblast cell lines were isolated, cultured and characterized on the basis of the expression of specific isoform \u03b1 of smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and of the excessive production of type I collagen. To assess the proliferative potential of the cell lines, growth curves were constructed, whereas the production and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) were analyzed by ELISA and enzymography, respectively. Myofibroblast clones were positive for \u03b1-SMA and vimentin, and negative for pan-cytokeratin and CD34. In long time cultures, western blotting, flow cytometry and ELISA analysis revealed constant \u03b1-SMA expression and elevated production of type I collagen. There were no differences on proliferative potential between fibroblast and myofibroblast clones, but myofibroblast cells secreted significantly higher levels of MMP-1, -2, -9 and -13.

We report our experience in the use of a vascularized corticoperiosteal bone flap from the medial femoral supracondylar region in the treatment of recalcitrant humeral nonunions.\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients treated with this technique over a 4-year period within our institution. Patient demographics, nonunion characteristics, complications, and long-term outcomes were analyzed.\nSix patients underwent vascularized periosteal graft reconstruction. Prior to this, all had failed an average of three procedures with the length of nonunion ranging from 6 to 68 months. All six nonunions healed by an average of 6.8 months (range 2-12 months). Two patients required additional secondary procedures.

{"title": "Myeloid cell diversification and complexity: an old concept with new turns in oncology.", "abstract": "Tumour development is accompanied by an enhanced haematopoiesis. This is not a widespread activation since only cells belonging to the myelo-monocytic compartment are expanded and mobilized from primary sites of haematopoiesis to other organs, reaching also the tumour stroma. This process occurs early during tumour formation but becomes more evident in advanced disease. Far from being a simple, unwanted consequence of cancer development, accumulation of myelo-monocytitc cells plays a role in tumour vascularization, local spreading, establishment of metastasis at distant sites, and contribute to create an environment unfavourable for the adoptive immunity against tumour-associated antigens. Myeloid populations involved in these process are likely different but many cells, expanded in primary and secondary lymphoid organs of tumour-bearing mice, share various levels of the CD11b and Gr-1 (Ly6C/G) markers. CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) cells are currently named myeloid-derived suppressor cells for their ability to inhibit T lymphocyte responses in tumour-bearing hosts.

{"title": "A two-way communication between microglial cells and angiogenic sprouts regulates angiogenesis in aortic ring cultures.", "abstract": "Myeloid cells have been associated with physiological and pathological angiogenesis, but their exact functions in these processes remain poorly defined. Monocyte-derived tissue macrophages of the CNS, or microglial cells, invade the mammalian retina before it becomes vascularized. Recent studies correlate the presence of microglia in the developing CNS with vascular network formation, but it is not clear whether the effect is directly caused by microglia and their contact with the endothelium.\nWe combined in vivo studies of the developing mouse retina with in vitro studies using the aortic ring model to address the role of microglia in developmental angiogenesis. Our in vivo analyses are consistent with previous findings that microglia are present at sites of endothelial tip-cell anastomosis, and genetic ablation of microglia caused a sparser vascular network associated with reduced number of filopodia-bearing sprouts. Addition of microglia in the aortic ring model was sufficient to stimulate vessel sprouting. The effect was independent of physical contact between microglia and endothelial cells, and could be partly mimicked using microglial cell-conditioned medium. Addition of VEGF-A promoted angiogenic sprouts of different morphology in comparison with the microglial cells, and inhibition of VEGF-A did not affect the microglia-induced angiogenic response, arguing that the proangiogenic factor(s) released by microglia is distinct from VEGF-A. Finally, microglia exhibited oriented migration towards the vessels in the aortic ring cultures.\nMicroglia stimulate vessel sprouting in the aortic ring cultures via a soluble microglial-derived product(s), rather than direct contact with endothelial cells. The observed migration of microglia towards the growing sprouts suggests that their position near endothelial tip-cells could result from attractive cues secreted by the vessels. Our data reveals a two-way communication between microglia and vessels that depends on soluble factors and should extend the understanding of how microglia promote vascular network formation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-01-26", "authors": ["Simin FRymo", "HolgerGerhardt", "FredrikWolfhagen Sand", "RichardLang", "AnneUv", "ChristerBetsholtz"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0015846"}

Most uterine sarcomas arise de novo, with malignant transformation of a benign mesenchymal tumor being a very rare event, and is reported only in leiomyomata.\nThe clinicopathologic features of 3 uterine liposarcomas arising in association with a lipoleiomyoma were studied. Immunohistochemistry for desmin, h-caldesmon, S100, and MDM2, and fluorescence in situ hybridization for the t(12;16) (q13;p11) were performed in all cases.\nPatients ranged in age from 49 to 70 (mean, 59) years. The tumors were centered in the myometrium, ranged in size from 10 to 18.5 cm, and showed a gelatinous cut surface with foci of necrosis. On microscopic examination, the tumors had well-circumscribed pushing margins. One neoplasm was uniformly hypocellular with a prominent myxoid background, and a striking delicate vascular network. Another neoplasm showed alternating hypocellular (myxoid) and hypercellular areas, whereas the third tumor was uniformly hypercellular with a hyalinized background. In the myxoid areas, the cells were small and spindle with oval nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. In the hypercellular areas, the cells were pleomorphic with large, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic activity ranged from <3 to 7/10 high-power fields. Lipoblasts were present in all tumors but were more common in the hypercellular areas. Two tumors merged imperceptibly with a lipoleiomyoma (1 typical and 1 with bizarre nuclei), whereas the third tumor showed an infarcted area composed of ghost mature adipocytes admixed with hyalinized smooth muscle most consistent with an infarcted lipoleiomyoma. Tumors were classified as myxoid, mixed myxoid and pleomorphic, and pleomorphic liposarcoma, respectively. The benign and malignant adipose components were positive for S100, whereas the benign smooth muscle component stained for desmin and h-caldesmon. MDM2 immunostain was positive in the 2 cases with a pleomorphic liposarcoma component. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was successfully completed in only 1 of 3 tumors (pure pleomorphic liposarcoma), which failed to show the t(12;16) and HMAG2 amplification.

FGF9 promotes cardiac vascularization during embryonic development but is only weakly expressed in the adult heart.\nWe used a tetracycline-responsive binary transgene system based on the \u03b1-myosin heavy chain promoter to test whether conditional expression of FGF9 in the adult myocardium supports adaptation after MI. In sham-operated mice, transgenic FGF9 stimulated left ventricular hypertrophy with microvessel expansion and preserved systolic and diastolic function. After coronary artery ligation, transgenic FGF9 enhanced hypertrophy of the noninfarcted left ventricular myocardium with increased microvessel density, reduced interstitial fibrosis, attenuated fetal gene expression, and improved systolic function. Heart failure mortality after MI was markedly reduced by transgenic FGF9, whereas rupture rates were not affected. Adenoviral FGF9 gene transfer after MI similarly promoted left ventricular hypertrophy with improved systolic function and reduced heart failure mortality. Mechanistically, FGF9 stimulated proliferation and network formation of endothelial cells but induced no direct hypertrophic effects in neonatal or adult rat cardiomyocytes in vitro. FGF9-stimulated endothelial cell supernatants, however, induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via paracrine release of bone morphogenetic protein 6. In accord with this observation, expression of bone morphogenetic protein 6 and phosphorylation of its downstream targets SMAD1/5 were increased in the myocardium of FGF9 transgenic mice.\nConditional expression of FGF9 promotes myocardial vascularization and hypertrophy with enhanced systolic function and reduced heart failure mortality after MI.

We found that the recombinant alphastatin lentiviruses were able to stably infect HUVECs, and infected HUVECs could sustainably secrete alphastatin, which exhibited potent inhibitory effects on HUVECs migration, differentiation but not proliferation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF). And the expression of secreted protein alphastatin markedly decreased tumor vascularization and inhibited tumor growth. Additionally, alphastatin inhibited VEGF- or bFGF-induced initial stage of angiogenesis by reducing JNk and ERK phosphorylation in vitro. Taken together, these data demonstrate that secreted protein alphastatin inhibits VEGF- or bFGF-induced angiogenesis by suppressing JNK and ERK kinases activation pathways in HUVECs, and markedly inhibits tumor angiogenesis in vivo.

The development of new treatment modalities in order to improve long-term survival of patients with HNSCC is imperative. Numerous studies have demonstrated that carcinogenesis and tumor cell dissemination is influenced by the tumor microenvironment. The protein-kinase-receptors (PTKs) are essential elements of the intracellular signal transduction pathway and regulate cell growth, development and apoptosis. Cell proliferation, migration, induction of tumor vascularization and carcinogenesis, invasion is regulated by a variety of angiogenic factors, such as PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and their respective tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGF-R and VEGF-R). They present promising targets for anti-cancer therapy through abrogation of impaired signaling pathways. Indeed, imatinib, a small molecule drug targeting these protein kinases, has antiproliferative effects in several cancer types. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential synergism of imatinib and carboplatin on the expression of PDGF, PDGF-R \u03b1/\u00df and VEGF in different HNSCC cell lines.

{"title": "Neuronal FLT1 receptor and its selective ligand VEGF-B protect against retrograde degeneration of sensory neurons.", "abstract": "Even though VEGF-B is a homologue of the potent angiogenic factor VEGF, its angiogenic activities have been controversial. Intrigued by findings that VEGF-B may also affect neuronal cells, we assessed the neuroprotective and vasculoprotective effects of VEGF-B in the skin, in which vessels and nerves are functionally intertwined. Although VEGF-B and its FLT1 receptor were prominently expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating the hindlimb skin, they were not essential for nerve function or vascularization of the skin. However, primary DRG cultures lacking VEGF-B or FLT1 exhibited increased neuronal stress and were more susceptible to paclitaxel-induced cell death. Concomitantly, mice lacking VEGF-B or a functional FLT1 developed more retrograde degeneration of sensory neurons in a model of distal neuropathy. On the other hand, the addition of the VEGF-B isoform, VEGF-B(186), to DRG cultures antagonized neuronal stress, maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential and stimulated neuronal survival. Mice overexpressing VEGF-B(186) or FLT1 selectively in neurons were protected against the distal neuropathy, whereas exogenous VEGF-B(186), either delivered by gene transfer or as a recombinant factor, was protective by directly affecting sensory neurons and not the surrounding vasculature. Overall, this indicates that VEGF-B, instead of acting as an angiogenic factor, exerts direct neuroprotective effects through FLT1.

{"title": "Hyaluronic Acid hydrogels support cord-like structures from endothelial colony-forming cells.", "abstract": "The generation of functional vascular networks has the potential to improve treatment for vascular diseases and to facilitate successful organ transplantation. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) have robust proliferative potential and can form vascular networks in vivo. ECFCs are recruited from a bone marrow niche to the site of vascularization, where cues from the extracellular matrix instigate vascular morphogenesis. Although this process has been elucidated using natural matrix, little is known about vascular morphogenesis by ECFCs in synthetic matrix, a xeno-free scaffold that can provide a more controllable and clinically relevant alternative for regenerative medicine. We sought to study hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels as three-dimensional scaffolds for capillary-like structure formation from ECFCs, and to determine the crucial parameters needed to design such synthetic scaffolds. We found that ECFCs express HA-specific receptors and that vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates hyaluronidase expression in ECFCs. Using a well-defined and controllable three-dimensional HA culture system, we were able to decouple the effect of matrix viscoelasticity from changes in adhesion peptide density. We determined that decreasing matrix viscoelasticity, which corresponds to a loose ultrastructure, significantly increases ECFC vascular tube length and area, and that the effect of local delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor within the hydrogel depends on the makeup of the synthetic environment. Collectively, these results set forth initial design criteria that need to be considered in developing vascularized tissue constructs.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) alone or VEGF/FGF combinations do not support these responses.

In addition to endothelial cell proliferation and migration, the angiogenic process requires bone marrow-derived cell (BMDC) recruitment to sites of neovascularization. However, the mechanism of communication between hypoxic tissues and the BM remains unknown. Using 2 models of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis (ischemic hindlimb surgery and subcutaneous tumor growth), we show that platelet infusion promotes BMDC mobilization into the circulation, BMDC recruitment into growing neovasculature, tumor vascularization, and blood flow restoration in ischemic limbs, whereas platelet depletion inhibits these effects. Thus, platelets are required for BMDC recruitment into ischemia-induced vasculature. Secretion of platelet \u03b1-granules, but neither dense granules nor platelet aggregation is crucial for BMDC homing and subsequent angiogenesis, as determined using VAMP-8(-/-), Pearl, and integrin Beta 3(-/-) platelets. Finally, platelets sequester tumor-derived promoters of angiogenesis and BMDC mobilization, which are counterbalanced by the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1. A lack of thrombospondin-1 in platelets leads to an imbalance in proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors and accelerates tumor growth and vascularization. Our data demonstrate that platelets stimulate BMDC homing in a VAMP-8-dependent manner, revealing a previously unknown role for platelets as key mediators between hypoxic tissues and the bone marrow during angiogenesis.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2011-01-13", "authors": ["WeiyiFeng", "MariaMadajka", "Bethany AKerr", "Ganapati HMahabeleshwar", "Sidney WWhiteheart", "Tatiana VByzova"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2010-08-304808"}

Intraperitoneal endometriotic lesions were surgically induced in irradiated FVB/N mice, which were reconstituted with bone marrow from FVB/N-TgN (Tie2/green fluorescent protein [GFP]) 287 Sato mice. Vascularization and recruitment of GFP-positive EPCs in the lesions was analyzed by intravital fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry over 4 weeks. The numbers of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2-positive EPCs in blood and hematopoietic organs of additional endometriotic and control mice were assessed by flow cytometry. We found that approximately 15% of the microvascular endothelium in engrafting endometriotic lesions consisted of incorporated GFP-positive EPCs. Recruitment of EPCs into the lesions coincided with the establishment of own blood supply and the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1. Accordingly, treatment with the stromal cell-derived factor-1/chemokine receptor type 4 axis antagonist AMD3100 significantly decreased the number of recruited EPCs and the vascularization of endometriotic lesions. However, endometriosis did not induce increased levels of EPCs in the blood, bone marrow, and spleen of C57BL/6 mice. To our knowledge, our findings indicate for the first time that vasculogenesis (ie, de novo generation of blood vessels from EPCs) may represent an integral mechanism in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2011-01-13", "authors": ["Matthias WLaschke", "ChristianGiebels", "Ruth MNickels", "ClaudiaScheuer", "Michael DMenger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.11.037"}
{"title": "Immunohistochemical analysis of vascular density and area in colorectal carcinoma using different markers and comparison with clinicopathologic prognostic factors.", "abstract": "Analysis of blood and lymphatic vessel in colorectal cancer is controversial in the literature, possibly due to variations in the methods of analysis. In this study, it was aimed to search for a reliable approach in the quantification of angio- and lymphangiovascular density and area as a prognostic factor and to compare such vessel counts in normal mucosa, adenomas and cancer. A retrospective study was performed on 60 sporadic colorectal cancer, 30 colorectal adenomas, and 10 colorectal non-neoplastic lesions. Archival tissues were submitted to immunohistochemical evaluation using antibodies to CD31, CD34, CD105, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and D2-40. Microvessel density and total vascular area were determined by computer image analysis and values were compared in the three groups of lesions; the prognostic value of these parameters was evaluated in the group of colorectal cancer. Most markers showed progressive vessel counts from non-neoplastic tissue to carcinoma, both for microvessel density and total vascular area. Only microvessel density determined by CD34 in the central areas of the cancer correlated with recurrence/metastasis (p = 0.04) and survival (p = 0.02). Different methods of quantification (microvessel counting versus estimation of total vascular area), immunohistochemical markers (pan-endothelial marker versus neovessels and lymphatic markers), and areas of analysis (periphery versus inner portions of the lesion) were assessed using image analysis. The results corroborate the increase in vascularization of carcinoma and suggest that microvessel density determined by immunostaining for CD34 in the inner portion of the tumor might represent a prognostically relevant parameter in colorectal cancer.", "journal": "Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine", "date": "2011-01-12", "authors": ["Luciana ReginaMoreira", "Andr\u00e9 AlmeidaSchenka", "PauloLatuf-Filho", "Andr\u00e9 LisboaPenn\u00e1", "Carmen S PLima", "Fernando AugustoSoares", "Miriam Aparecida SilvaTrevisan", "Jos\u00e9Vassallo"], "doi": "10.1007/s13277-010-0147-0"}

F/P MPs could immobilize FGF-2, thereafter gradually releasing the bound FGF-2. Inbred Fisher 344 rats weighing around 150 g were anesthetized and implanted with paste comprising harvested fat combined with F/P MP-F. The effect of F/P MP-F on the survival, granulation, and capillary formation in fat grafts was histologically compared with control grafts containing either FGF-2, F/P MPs or PBS. The control fat grafts became attached to tissues adjacent to the implantation site and were significantly resorbed after 30 days. In contrast, pink, soft, supple grafts were compressible and were little resorbed in the group given F/P FP MP-F at 30-120 days. Normal adipocytes were obviously decreased in the control groups with increased granulation tissues, whereas normal adipocytes with capillary formations were maintained in the F/P MP-F group.

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) have shown vascularization potential in ischemic conditions and may also support blood vessel formation in tissue-engineered matrices. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of a well-characterized murine embryonal EPC line (T17b-EPC) on vascularization and fibrovascular granulation tissue formation after suspension in a fibrine matrix followed by subcutaneous implantation in a separation chamber in rats. EPC were fluorescently labelled in vitro prior to implantation. After 3, 7 or 14 days, animals were killed followed by explantation and histological analysis of the constructs. Before the end of the experiment, Bandeirea Simplicifolia lectin was intravenously injected to mark the vascular ingrowth into the implanted constructs. The transplanted cells were histologically detected at all time-points and located almost exclusively within the fibrin matrix at day 3 but the number of cells in the clot continuously decreased over day 7 to day 14. Conversely, cells were detected within the newly formed granulation tissue in increasing numbers from day 3 over day 7 to day 14. Transplanted cells were also found in the intermuscular septa. Cell viability was confirmed by use of an EPC clone expressing \u03b2-galactosidase. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated integration of the transplanted cells in newly formed blood vessels within the fibrovascular granulation tissue adjacent to the fibrin clot. Presence of cells in the fibrin clot lead to thicker granulation tissue and an increased blood vessel diameter compared to cell-free controls. Organ standard controls showed presence of the transplanted cells in spleens at day 14 after transplantation. In summary, EPC exhibited biological activity after subcutaneous implantation in a fibrin matrix by migration from the fibrin clot into the granulation tissue and along intermuscular septae, undergoing differentiation into mature endothelial cells and integration into newly formed blood vessels and altering fibrovascular granulation tissue development. EPC may hold promise to modulate blood vessel formation in bioartificial matrices.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2011-01-05", "authors": ["OliverBleiziffer", "MatthiasHammon", "ElisabethNaschberger", "KarolineLipnik", "AndreasArkudas", "SubhaRath", "GalynaPryymachuk", "Justus PBeier", "MichaelSt\u00fcrzl", "Raymund EHorch", "UlrichKneser"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01247.x"}

{"title": "Redox sensitive Pyk2 as a target for therapeutics in breast cancer.", "abstract": "Breast cancer progression is dependent on the formation of new blood vessels that not only help the tumor by supplying additional nutrients, but also allow cancer cells to spread from the breast to distant sites in the body. Several studies suggest a positive correlation between new vessel formation and estrogens. Estrogenic environmental chemicals such as PCBs have been shown to increase the expression of factors known to promote vessel formation in breast tumors. These studies highlight a growing concern that women exposed to estrogenic environmental compounds may be more susceptible to either aggressive metastatic tumors or a high recurrence of breast cancer. Our concept offers a fundamental new understanding of the way the environment contributes to breast cancer progression. This review will be focused on a highly novel Pyk2 signaling complex as a target for therapy of estrogen dependent breast tumor angiogenesis. A better understanding of the role of Pyk2 signaling in estrogen dependent tumor vascularization may lead to the development of a new therapy against aggressive breast cancer using small molecule inhibitors of Pyk2.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition)", "date": "2011-01-05", "authors": ["QuentinFelty"], "doi": "10.2741/3706"}

The study also examined their feasibility as a temporary embolic agents in the pig renal artery.\nThree types of PVA microspheres with the degrees of saponification of 97 mol% (S97), 98 mol% (S98), and 99 mol% (S99) were prepared. Seven kidneys in seven miniature pigs were embolized and divided into three groups so there would be at least two kidneys for each type of PVA. One animal in each group was euthanized immediately after angiography at 3 hours after embolization and the other one at 7 days after. In addition, one animal embolized with S99 microspheres was euthanized at 21 days after embolization.\nWith S97 microspheres, the vascular network had recovered to the preembolic state by 3 hours after embolization. With S98 microspheres, blood flow in the third-order branch had been restored in the same period. With S99 microspheres, the second- and lower order branches remained occluded until 21 days. Histopathologic specimens harvested at 3 hours revealed only a trace of PVA for S97 microspheres. With S98 microspheres, the vascular lumen was still found to be filled with PVA gel. With S99 microspheres, swollen microspheres densely filled the vascular lumen even on day 21.\nDissolution process in vitro and the duration of arterial occlusion in vivo were possibly related to the degree of saponification of PVA.

Primary MSC from cortical bone (CB)\u00a0 tissue proved to form more and larger colony units, as well as produce more mineral matrix under osteogenic differentiation, than MSC from bone marrow (BM). Coating pre-treatments were optimized for maximum cell adhesion and mineralization, while a PRP-based gel carrier was created to efficiently deliver and retain MSC and\u00a0 microparticles within a porous scaffold while simultaneously promoting cell recruitment, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Components and composite sponges were evaluated for osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Osteogenic sponges were loaded with MSC, PRP, PA, and NSE and implanted subcutaneously in rats to evaluate the formation of bone tissue and angiogenesis in vivo. It was found that the combination of a collagen sponge with CB MSC, PRP, PA, and the BMP2-releasing NSE formed the most bone and was most vascularized by four weeks compared to analogous composites featuring BM MSC or PCL or lacking PRP, PA, and NSE.

Unfortunately, angiogenesis is a key process in various physiologic and pathologic processes and is, for instance, involved in modern anticancer approaches. Thus ability to visualize angiogenesis could allow early diagnosis and help to monitor the response of cancer to specific chemotherapies. Therefore, indirect analytical techniques are required to assess the localization of fluorinated compounds at a micrometric scale. Multimodality imaging approaches could provide accurate information on the metabolic activity of the target tissue. In this article, PIGE method (Particle Induced Gamma-ray Emission) was used to determine fluorinated tracers by the nuclear reaction of 19F(p,p'\u03b3)19F in tissues.

As such a scaffold structure, the present study created novel hydrogel materials by chemically cross-linking alkali-treated collagen (AlCol) with trisuccinimidyl citrate (TSC).\nMany prototypes, consisting of several concentrations of TSC and AlCol, were implanted into the subfascial space of the rat rectus muscle, and 7 days later, the implanted materials were excised for histological analysis. Cross-sections were stained and neovascular development in the materials was evaluated by measuring vessel density, length and number of joints and branches.\nSignificant ingrowth of vascularized granulation was observed in some materials, which surpassed the angiogenic ability of Matrigel(TM).

This is not only due to improved technical possibilities such as intraoperative navigation, the development of specialized instruments, and the compilation of anatomical studies from the endoscopic perspective but also related to the accumulating experience with endoscopic procedures of the skull base by multidisciplinary centers. Endoscopic endonasal operations permit new approaches to deeply seated lesions and are characterized by a reduced manipulation of neurovascular structures and brain parenchyma while at the same time providing improved visualization. They reduce the trauma caused by the approach, avoid skin incisions and minimize the surgical morbidity. Transnasal endoscopic procedures for the closure of small and large skull base defects have proven to be reliable and more successful than operations with craniotomies. The development of new local and regional vascularized flaps like the Hadad-flap have contributed to this.

We report the procedures and safety of AOCAB for multivessel disease.\n: Fifty-five multivessel AOCAB (52 men, 3 women; aged 68 \u00b1 9.5 years) were performed at our hospital between 2003 and 2010. A medium sternotomy was made after TEA was established. During coronary artery anastomosis, a stabilizer and an apical suction device were used, and a coronary artery active perfusion system was used to maintain flow distal to the anastomosis. Pneumothorax due to pleural opening, when occurred, was repaired using Neoveil sheet and drainage tube.\n: There was no operative death and no cerebral ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Operating time was 177 \u00b1 35 minutes. Left internal thoracic artery was used in 55 anastomoses, right internal thoracic artery in 7, gastroepiploic artery in 17, radial artery in 48, and saphenous vein in 24. Time of anastomosis was 4.93 \u00b1 0.92 minutes for left anterior descending coronary artery, 4.75 \u00b1 1.21 minutes for circumflex artery, and 4.98 \u00b1 1.02 minutes for right coronary artery. Intraprocedural pneumothorax occurred in 17 cases; 14 were repaired and nonintubated AOCAB was accomplished, 1 was intubated, and 2 had temporary assisted ventilation and laryngeal mask.

Their healthy eyes were the source of limbal epithelium for corneal epithelial culture. Limbal cells from a 2 mm2 biopsy were seeded on amniotic membrane. Cultures were carried out in standard conditions in supplemented DMEM in presence of 3T3 fibroblasts. After superficial keratectomy the amniotic carriers with epithelial cells were transplanted on denuded corneas. The presence of corneal vascularization, epithelial regularity and visual acuity were evaluated.\nPostoperative follow-up ranged from 3 up to 9 months, average 4.9 +/- 1.1 months. 3 months after the surgery 72.0% of the eyes showed stable epithelium with slight corneal haze caused by the amnion. In 60.0% of the eyes there was no recurrent conjunctival neovascularization. 28.0% of the eyes remained cloudy due to stromal revascularization. In 2 eyes total conjunctival pannus developed again.

{"title": "Normal parathyroid hormone levels do not exclude permanent hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy.", "abstract": "Permanent hypoparathyroidism has become the most common and the most severe complication after thyroid surgery. In our experience, some patients suffer from permanent hypocalcemia and related symptoms despite normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) values after thyroid surgery. The aim of this work was to present a series of such patients with long-term hypocalcemia and normal PTH values to evaluate to what extent parathyroid function was impaired by thyroidectomy, and determine whether irregularities of bone and calcium metabolism were associated with this phenomenon.\nWe present a series of eight patients with normal PTH and subnormal calcium levels at follow-up 2 months after thyroid surgery. Outcome parameters were intra- and postoperative PTH and calcium kinetics, and the following markers of calcium and bone metabolism at long-term follow-up: serum calcium, total serum albumin, ionized calcium, magnesium, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, urinary calcium, urinary creatinine, osteocalcin, c-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and alkaline phosphatase.\nAll patients had normal calcium and PTH levels at the start of the operation. The intraoperative decline in PTH was >90%; the trough (3.3% of preoperative value) was reached 3 hours after surgery. Patients underwent complete determination of bone metabolism parameters during long-term follow-up 13.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 months after surgery. Hypocalcemia was found in all eight patients, as well as PTH levels within the normal range. In three patients (3/8\u2009=\u200937.5%), none of the other parameters was altered. In the remaining five patients, only isolated abnormalities in bone and calcium metabolism parameters were found (i.e., alterations in urinary calcium, thyrotropin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, and c-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen).\nAn intraoperative injury to the parathyroid glands or their vascularization is the likely contributing factor to the development of permanent hypocalcemia with normal PTH values after thyroid surgery. The remaining parathyroid tissue is subject to a maximum stimulus by hypocalcemia and, therefore, is able to maintain PTH values in the normal range. These are still too low to re-establish normal serum calcium levels.

However, histological composition of TEAV must allow for functional properties, such as vasomotoricity. Aim of this study was to characterize human TEAVs regarding morphology and vasomotoricity.\nThree groups containing segments of porcine carotid artery < 5 mm in diameter (native [NA, n = 6], decellularized [DA, n = 6], and decellularized/reseeded in a bioreactor [RA, n = 7] with human vascular endothelial [hvECs] and smooth muscle cells [hvSMCs]) were examined. Light and scanning electron microscopy were applied, and hvSMCs- and hvECs-associated Vasomotoricity Test conducted in Krebs-solution was used for characterization of revitalized TEAVs.\nMorphologic examination showed cell-free extracellular matrix in DAs. Light microscopy demonstrated intact extracellular matrix components in circle-layered formation in cross sections of DAs. RAs showed small cells migrating along the remaining medial fiber structures and flat cell layers at the luminal site, identified as hvECs and hvSMCs with lower CD-31 and \u03b1-actin signaling than controls. Scanning electron microscopy showed intact flat cell layers on luminal surfaces of RAs and dense hvSMCs at their media site. DAs showed decreasing strain after stimulation. RAs retrieved vasomotoricity compared to DAs, but showed reduced contraction and incomplete relaxation compared to NAs.\nThis study shows that revitalization of DA with human vascular cells resembles NA-like morphology and can ensure vasomotoricity of TEAVs.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Transplantation of nanostructured composite scaffolds results in the regeneration of chronically injured spinal cords.", "abstract": "The destruction and hollowing of entire tissue segments represent an insurmountable barrier to axonal regeneration and therapeutics in chronic spinal cord injury. To circumvent this problem, we engineered neural prosthetics, by assembling electrospun nanofibers and self-assembling peptides into composite guidance channels and transplanted them into the cysts of a postcontusive, chronic spinal cord injury rat model, also providing delivery of proregenerative cytokines. Six months later conspicuous cord reconstruction was observed. The cyst was replaced by newly formed tissue comprising neural and stromal cells.

This was accompanied by a significant improvement in the activity of ascending and descending motor pathways and the global locomotion score.

{"title": "Developing vasculature and stroma in engineered human myocardium.", "abstract": "We recently developed a scaffold-free patch of human myocardium with human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and showed that stromal and endothelial cells form vascular networks in vitro and improve cardiomyocyte engraftment. Here, we hypothesize that stromal cells regulate the angiogenic phenotype by modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM). Human marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) support the greatest degree of endothelial cell organization, at 1.3- to 2.4-fold higher than other stromal cells tested. Stromal cells produce abundant ECM components in patches, including fibrillar collagen, hyaluronan, and versican. We identified two clonal hMSC lines that supported endothelial networks poorly and robustly. Interestingly, the pro-angiogenic hMSCs express high levels of versican, a chondroitin sulfate proteglycan that modulates angiogenesis and wound healing, whereas poorly angiogenic hMSCs produce little versican. When transplanted onto uninjured athymic rat hearts, patches with proangiogenic hMSCs develop ~ 50-fold more human vessels and form anastomoses with the host circulation, resulting in chimeric vessels containing erythrocytes. Thus, stromal cells play a key role in supporting vascularization of engineered human myocardium. Different stromal cell types vary widely in their proangiogenic ability, likely due in part to differences in ECM synthesis. Comparison of these cells defines an in vitro predictive platform for studying vascular development.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In the literature, the morphology of CPs and the process that regulates the production of CSF are virtually nonexistent for domestic ruminants. Thus this study has two aims: 1. to investigate the morpho-structure of the buffalo CP microvasculature utilizing light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, and 2. to investigate the relationship between the blood vessels and both the elongated cells and the cells with multiple protrusions located in the CPs. SEM and TEM analyses of the CPs from buffalo brain showed morphological and structural features similar those reported in other mammalian species. Moreover the blood microvasculature is the major component responsible for the formation of the CSF, secreted by the encephalic CPs. In addition the chemical composition of this fluid depends on several morpho-functional characteristics of the vascularization of the CPs. These characteristics are as follows: two shapes of the vascular organization: lamina-like and ovoid-like elongated cells of the CPs, which connect the ventricular cavities to the blood capillaries; and the CP capillaries have diverse forms. In the present study the employment of NADPHd and NOS I was taken as indirect evidence for the presence of NO for investigation their specific role in CPs. Then NOS I immunoreactivity is found in the walls of CP blood vessels demonstrating indirectly the presence of NO with a vaso-dilatatory and autoregulation function of vascular tone by cholinergic nerve stimulation of blood vessel smooth muscle.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2010-12-25", "authors": ["GaetanoScala", "MarioCorona", "EmiliaLangella", "LuciannaMaruccio"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.20875"}

{"title": "Reconstruction of large palatal defects using the free anterolateral thigh flap.", "abstract": "The ideal reconstructive method for the palatal defect should provide durable, stable coverage, and a natural contour, while simultaneously minimizing morbidity of both the defect and donor sites. Although small and usual palatal defects can be repaired easily using local adjacent tissues, successful closure of large, complex defects is still a challenging problem. Numerous free tissue options have to date been described for large palatal defects. Although the radial forearm flap constitutes a good option for ideal reconstructive goals, the sacrifice of a major artery to the hand and the skin graft to the forearm with its high potential risk of complications are evident problems attendant upon this donor site. Since the first report of the anterolateral thigh flap, this has become one of the most commonly used flaps for the reconstruction of various soft-tissue defects. Between April 2005 and May 2009, 8 free anterolateral thigh flaps were used to reconstruct defects of the palate. The study involved 6 male and 2 female patients, their ages ranging from 3 to 45. Five patients had palatal defects due to congenital cleft palate deformity, 2 patients had defects due to tumor resection, and the remaining patient had a palatal defect due to a gunshot wound. The size of the flaps ranged from 8 to 14 cm in length and from 4 to 7 cm in width. Facial vessels were used as recipient vascular sources in all patients. Primary thinning of the flap was performed in all cases. Donor sites were closed directly and healed uneventfully in all patients. There were no postoperative complications and all flaps survived totally. No debulking was needed. All patients, and their families in the case of child patients, were satisfied with the results of their surgical treatment. In conclusion, although it has some irregularity in derivation from the main vessels, with its evident structural and cosmetic advantages the anterolateral thigh flap can be considered an excellent and ideal free flap option for most large palatal defects that cannot be closed by regional tissue in selected patients. It can reconstruct defects in single stage with well-vascularized tissue, resulting in minimal donor site morbidity.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2010-12-24", "authors": ["OmerOzkan", "OzlenenOzkan", "O KorayCoskunfirat", "NecmiyeHadimio\u011flu"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181e35cd8"}

Patients whose nodes revealed these features underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) focusing on the area of cortical thickening. Enhancement in the arterial and parenchymal phases was evaluated: A generalized homogeneous or intense enhancement was considered benign and the presence of a perfusion defect was considered metastatic.\nAfter exclusion of 24 patients with frank signs of malignancy at gray-scale ultrasound, the study included 436 patients. Focal hypoechoic cortical thickening was seen in 44 of 436 nodes in as many patients. In 29 nodes, the area of focal thickening showed contrast enhancement similar to that of the remaining cortex on contrast-enhanced ultrasound. In 15 nodes, the area of cortical thickening was less well vascularized than the adjacent parenchyma in the arterial phase and there were areas with perfusion defects that were more evident in the parenchymal phase. FNAC focusing on the areas of focal cortical thickening identified 13 metastatic nodes and 31 nodes with benign features. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound compared with FNAC correctly classified 42 of 44 nodes, showing a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99.5%.\nAlthough our findings need to be confirmed in larger series, they indicate that contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be useful in clinical practice for characterizing focal cortical thickening in lymph nodes.

Mutations in the Wnt receptor FZD4 gene have been confirmed to cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). FEVR is characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina, which can lead to vitreous bleeding, tractional retinal detachment, and blindness. We screened for mutations in the FZD4 gene in five families with FEVR and identified five mutations (C45Y, Y58C, W226X, C204R, and W496X), including three novel mutations (C45Y, Y58C, and W226X). In the retina, Norrin serves as a ligand and binds to FZD4 to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in normal angiogenesis and vascularization. The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD4 has been shown to play a critical role in Norrin-FZD4 binding. We investigated the effect of mutations in the FZD4 CRD in Norrin binding and signaling in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type and mutant FZD4 proteins were assayed for Norrin binding and Norrin-dependent activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by cell-surface and overlay binding assays and luciferase reporter assays. In HEK293 transfection studies, C45Y, Y58C, and C204R mutants did not bind to Norrin and failed to transduce FZD4-mediated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. In vivo studies using Xenopus embryos showed that these FZD4 mutations disrupt Norrin/\u03b2-catenin signaling as evidenced by decreased Siamois and Xnr3 expression.

Female Cebpb(gc)(-/-) mutant mice, but not Cebpa(gc)(-/-) mice, were subfertile whereas Cebpa/b(gc)(-/-) double-mutant females were sterile. Follicles failed to ovulate, ovaries were devoid of corpora lutea, luteal cell marker genes (Lhcgr, Prlr, Ptgfr, Cyp11a1, and Star) were absent, and serum progesterone levels were low. Microarray analyses identified numerous C/EBP\u03b1/\u03b2 target genes in equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)-human (h)CG-treated mice. At 4 h post-hCG, a subset (19%) of genes altered in the Cebpa/b-depleted cells was also altered in ERK1/2-depleted cells; hence they are common effectors of ERK1/2. Additional genes down-regulated in the Cebpa/b-depleted cells at 8 and 24 h post-hCG include known (Akr1b7, Runx2, Star, Saa3) and novel (Abcb1b, Apln, Igfbp4, Prlr, Ptgfr Timp4) C/EBP targets and effectors of luteal and vascular cell development. Bhmt, a gene controlling methionine metabolism and thought to be expressed exclusively in liver and kidney, was high in wild-type luteal cells but totally absent in Cebpa/b mutant cells. Because numerous genes potentially associated with vascular development were suppressed in the mutant cells, C/EBP\u03b1/\u03b2 appear to dictate the luteinization process by also controlling genes that regulate the formation of the extensive vascular network required to sustain luteal cells.

We establish that interstitial cells express Vegfa and respond, by proliferation, to endothelial migration. In the absence of vasculature, four-dimensional imaging of whole organs revealed that interstitial proliferation is reduced and prevents formation of wedge-like structures that partition the gonad into cord-forming domains. Antagonizing vessel maturation also reduced proliferation. However, proliferation of mesenchymal cells was rescued by the addition of PDGF-BB.

{"title": "Preoperative imaging study of the spinal cord vascularization: interest and limits in spine resection for primary tumors.", "abstract": "The necessicity to localize the anterior spinal arteries before anterior approach of the spine stays controversial by orthopaedic surgeons. On the other hand the surgical treatment of thoracoabdominal aneurisms routinely sacrifices many segmental arteries pairs without spinal arteries localization. This, associated with spinal cord protection, results to few neurological complication. However, during vertebrectomies, the roots ligation completely interrupts the spinal cord blood supply at this level. In our experience the spinal arteries localization was systematically done before ninety-eight spine resections. In five cases an anterior radiculomedullary artery was ligated (four anterior radiculomedullary and one great anterior radiculomedullary arteries) without neurological complication, in two cases of extended resection (more than four levels) a neurological complication occurred. No spinal artery was identified at the resection level and the neurological complications were resolutive and did not seem related to definitive vascular problem. These accomplishments lead to discuss the importance of spinal arteries localization and preservation in this surgery. The discovery of an anterior radiculomedullary artery is not a contraindication to en-bloc vertebrectomy at this level, nevertheless in the case of great anterior radiculomedullary artery (Adamkiewicz) the surgical indication must be seriously debated. In fact, this case and those where multilevel resections (more than three levels) are indicated seem the most dangerous situations and the use of the different means of spinal cord protection could be indicated to decrease neurological risk.

Mice were treated with either the antagonist Jagged1-Fc chimera (Jag1-Fc) or agonist Notch1 antibody (N1 Ab) immediately following a mid-thoracic contusive injury through an initial jugular bolus and tail vein injections for 3 days post-injury. After 14 days, activating Notch signaling decreased the overall vascular density within the penumbral gray matter compared to controls while maintaining the density of perfused vessels. Inhibiting Notch signaling did not change the density or perfusion of microvessels within the lesion penumbra. Furthermore, neither activation nor inhibition of Notch signaling significantly altered inflammation, hypoxia, and lesion volume in the epicenter and penumbra. Importantly, neither treatment changed locomotor function. In postnatal retinal vascular assays, administration of Jag1-Fc and N1 Ab increased and decreased both tip cell numbers and branch points in each treatment, respectively.

Additional bone grafting procedures were required in 4 patients with distal nonunions. There were 3 refractures (38%). Four patients eventually underwent amputation, and 1 patient had a persistent nonunion at final follow-up. Residual deformity included tibial valgus and procurvatum deformities, limb length discrepancy, and ankle valgus. Use of the ipsilateral fibula did not seem to increase the risk of ankle valgus. Functional outcomes were good in all but one patient.\nUse of the ipsilateral fibula as a pedicle graft provides reasonable results in healing congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia.

A number of single-center retrospective studies have documented equivalent outcomes in patients with either type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or T2DM undergoing predominantly SPKT, although clearly a selection bias exists for patients in the latter category. Selection criteria for SPKT in T2DM include patients less than 55-60 years of age with a BMI less than 30-32 kg/m\u00b2, insulin-requiring for a minimum of 5 years with a total daily insulin requirement less than 1 u/kg/day, a fasting C-peptide level less than 10 ng/ml, absence of severe vascular disease or tobacco abuse, adequate cardiac function, and presence of 'complicated' diabetes. Data from the International Pancreas Transplant Registry show that up to 7% of SPKT recipients are classified as having T2DM and that outcomes in these patients are comparable to those undergoing SPKT and classified as having T1DM.\nConsequently, characterization of the 'type' of diabetes may be irrelevant and insulin-requiring diabetic patients with ESRD should be evaluated for PTX based exclusively on their predicted ability to tolerate the surgical procedure and requisite immunosuppression as well as comply with a stringent posttransplant follow-up regimen.", "journal": "Current opinion in organ transplantation", "date": "2010-12-15", "authors": ["GiuseppeOrlando", "Robert JStratta", "JimmyLight"], "doi": "10.1097/MOT.0b013e3283424d1f"}

Women are often exposed to PAHs before pregnancy, typically via prepregnancy smoking. To determine how prepregnancy exposure affects the fetoplacental vasculature of the placenta, we exposed female mice to PAHs before conception, perfused the fetoplacental arterial trees with X-ray contrast agent, and imaged the vasculature ex vivo by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) at embryonic day 15.5. Automated vascular segmentation and flow calculations revealed that in control trees, <40 chorionic plate vessels (diameter>180 \u03bcm) gave rise to \u223c1,300 intraplacental arteries (50-180 \u03bcm), predicting an arterial vascular resistance of 0.37\u00b10.04 mmHg\u00b7s\u00b7\u03bcl(-1). PAH exposure increased vessel curvature of chorionic plate vessels and significantly increased the tortuousity ratio of the tree. Intraplacental arteries were reduced by 17%, primarily due to a 27% decrease in the number of arteriole-sized (50-100 \u03bcm) vessels. There were no changes in the number of chorionic vessels, the depth or span of the tree, the diameter scaling coefficient, or the segment length-to-diameter ratio. PAH exposure resulted in a tree with a similar size and dichotomous branching structure, but one that was comparatively sparse so that arterial vascular resistance was increased by 30%. Assuming the same pressure gradient, blood flow would be 19% lower. Low flow may contribute to the 23% reduction observed in fetal weight.

This ligament does not heal very well, leading to joint instability. Long-term instability of the knee can lead to early arthritis and loss of function.

Such a model must remain as simple as possible, but should include key features to provide relevant answers to precise questions about the clinical problem addressed. Here, we report tissue-engineered type I collagen scaffolds developed to establish an ACL healing model in vitro and a potential ACL substitute in vivo. Such scaffolds were used to evaluate ACL cell growth, migration, and the capacity to synthesize and assemble collagen fibers for up to 40 days in vitro and up to 180 days in vivo. They were anchored with two bone plugs to allow their static stretching in culture and to facilitate their surgical implantation in knee joints. Our results have shown that living ACL fibroblasts can attach, migrate, and colonize this type of scaffold. In vitro, the cells populated the scaffolds and expressed mRNAs coding for the prolyl-4-hydroxylase, involved in collagen fibers' assembly. In vivo, acellular implants were vascularized and populated with caprine cells that migrated from the osseous insertions toward the center of the grafts.

Heart remodelling, including fibrosis, hypertrophy, and decreased vascularization, is frequently present in renal diseases. Our objective was to investigate the impact of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) on cardiac remodelling and function in a rat model of renal disease.\nMale Sprague Dawley rats were divided into six groups: sham-operated rats, 5/6 nephrectomized rats (Nx) treated with vehicle, CNI (cyclosporine A 5.0 or 7.5, or tacrolimus 0.5 mg/kg/day) or hydralazine (20 mg/kg twice a day) for 14 days, starting on the day of surgery. Creatinine clearance was significantly lower and blood pressure significantly higher in Nx rats when compared with controls. Morphological and echocardiographic analyses revealed increased left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased number of capillaries in Nx rats. Treatment with CNI affected neither the renal function nor the blood pressure, but prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy and improved vascularization. In addition, regional blood volume improved as confirmed by contrast agent-based echocardiography. Hydralazine treatment did not avoid heart remodelling in this model. Gene expression analysis verified a decrease in hypertrophic genes in the heart of CNI-treated rats, while pro-angiogenic and stem cell-related genes were upregulated. Moreover, mobilization of stem/progenitor cells was increased through manipulation of the CD26/SDF-1 system.\nWe conclude from our studies that CNI-treatment significantly prevented cardiac remodelling and improved heart function in Nx rats without affecting renal function and blood pressure.

Transient muscular expression of the recombinant disintegrin domain (RDD) of metargidin (also known as ADAM-15) by in vivo electroporation reduced cutaneous angiogenesis and vascularization in all 3 models.

{"title": "Paradoxical effects of ethoxidine, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, in the cellular processes leading to angiogenesis on endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, a critical step in tumorigenesis, is defined by different processes leading to neovascularization. Topoisomerase I (Top I) is the target for some of the most successful anticancer drugs that decrease tumor cell proliferation. Ethoxidine, a benzo[c]phenanthridines derivative, camptothecin analogue, has been identified as a potent inhibitor of Top I in various cancer cell lines. This study was aimed to investigate the impact of ethoxidine on angiogenesis and cellular processes including migration, proliferation and adhesion since these processes play an important role in tumor progression. Ethoxidine was incubated for 24 h at low (10\u207b\u2079 M) and high (10\u207b\u2075 M) concentrations on two types of human endothelial cells: EaHy.926 and human umbilical endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 20 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. Ethoxidine at low concentration increased cell proliferation and migration that was associated with enhanced metalloproteinase 2 expression and activity, whereas high concentration of ethoxidine inhibited all of these effects. The two concentrations of ethoxidine did not affect endothelial cell adhesion. Low concentration of ethoxidine increased VEGF expression and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression, NO and superoxide anion productions, whereas high concentration of ethoxidine did not induce any effect. Taken together, the present results highlight paradoxical effects of ethoxidine on angiogenesis depending on the concentration used. This study underscores that in addition to its anti-proliferative properties, ethoxidine may affect the generation of vascular network in tumorigenesis.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2010-12-08", "authors": ["NicolasClere", "S\u00e9bastienFaure", "Jean-JacquesHelesbeux", "OlivierDuval", "RamarosonAndriantsitohaina"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgq260"}

Human islets (100islet equivalent/mL) were cultured alone (control) or co-cultured (experimental group) with whole human BM (1 \u00d7 10(6) cells/mL) for 210 days. A protein array measuring angiogenesis factors found upregulated (experimental vs control, day 210) proteins levels of VEGF-a (535 vs 2 pg/mL), PDGF (280.79 vs 0 pg/mL), KGF (939 vs 8 pg/mL), TIMP-1 (4592 vs 4332 pg/mL) and angiogenin (506 vs 97 pg/mL). Lower protein levels of angiopoietin-2 (5 vs 709 pg/mL) were observed. Depletion of pro-angiogenesis factors in co-culture decreased the effects of BM-induced islet vascularization. Depletion of VEGF-a, eKGF and PDGF significantly reduced islet vascularization but individual depletion of KGF and PDGF had less effects overall on vessel formation. BM-induced vascularization showed significant endothelial cell distribution. Islet vascularization was linked to islet growth. A decrease in islet size indicated poor vascularization. Insulin release was evident in the tissues generated from human islet-BM co-culture throughout the entire culture period. Significant increase in insulin (28.66-fold vs control) and glucagon (24.4-fold vs control) gene expression suggest BM can induce endocrine cell regeneration.

The delivery from implants of angiogenic factors, like VEGF, has been widely investigated for establishing a vascular network within the developing tissue. In this report, we investigated if encapsulation of VEGF in nanoparticles could enhance angiogenesis in vivo as compared to free VEGF when incorporated into two different types of 3D matrices: Matrigel\u2122 hydrogels and PLGA scaffolds. Negatively charged nanoparticles encapsulating VEGF were obtained with a high efficiency by complex formation with dextran sulfate and coacervation by chitosan. After 2weeks, encapsulation reduced VEGF release from hydrogels from 30% to 1% and increased VEGF release from scaffolds from 20% to 30% in comparison with free VEGF. VEGF encapsulation consistently improved angiogenesis in vivo with both type of 3D matrices: up to 7.5- to 3.5-times more endothelial and red blood cells were observed, respectively, into hydrogels and scaffolds. Hence, encapsulation in nanoparticles enhanced VEGF efficiency by protection and controlled release from 3D implants.

Studies of skeletal dental pulp samples are of particular interest since this location is potentially exposed to bloodborne agents during life through its vascularization, and could be considered as well preserved from environment after death of the host. DNA viruses belonging to the family Anelloviridae are highly present in human populations where they harbor an extreme genetic diversity but a yet undefined implication in hosts' health. We hypothesized that anelloviruses would be detected in ancient remains and that they may also serve as tracer viruses for the study of other viral agents. We analyzed 200-year-old dental pulp samples from remains of soldiers of Napoleon's Great Army during the Russian Retreat. Successful detection of Anelloviridae DNA by PCR was obtained for 1/21 ancient samples tested.

Recently, Ang2 was suggested to play a role in adult neurogenesis, affecting migration and differentiation of adult neuroblasts in vitro. However, to date, no data have reported an effect of Ang2 on neurogenesis during embryonic development. As we detected Ang2 expression in the developing cerebral cortex at embryonic day E14.5 and E16.5, we used in utero electroporation to knock down Ang2 expression in neuronal progenitors located in the cortical ventricular zone (VZ) to examine the role of Ang2 in cortical embryonic neurogenesis. Using this strategy, we showed that radial migration from the VZ toward the cortical plate of Ang2-knocked down neurons is altered as well as their morphology. In parallel, we observed a perturbation of intermediate progenitor population and the surrounding vasculature.

The transcriptional responses to the LH surge of preovulatory granulosa cells (GCs) are complex and still poorly understood. In this study, a genome-wide bovine oligo array was used to determine how the gene expression profile of GCs is modulated by the LH surge. GCs from three different stages were used to assess the short- and long-term effects of this hormone on follicle differentiation: 1) 2\u200ah before induction of the LH surge, 2) 6\u200ah and 3) 22\u200ah after the LH surge. The results obtained were a list of differentially expressed transcripts for each GC group. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the processes at play, biological annotations were used to reveal the different functions of transcripts, confirming that the LH surge acts in a temporal manner. The pre-LH group is involved in typical tasks such as cell division, development, and proliferation, while the early response to the LH surge included features such as response to stimulus, vascularization, and lipid synthesis, which are indicative of cells preparing for ovulation. The late response of GCs revealed terms associated with protein localization and intracellular transport, corresponding to the future secretion task that will be required for the transformation of GCs into corpus luteum.

The association between changes in the cortical anatomy and vascular organization raises questions about the actual physiological meaning of these features, most of all when dealing with the origin of the modern human brain. Metabolism and thermoregulation may be relevant factors in influencing morphological adaptations between brain and vessels. This study is aimed at investigating the relationships between endocranial morphology and endocranial vessels in modern humans and to analyze the pattern of heat dissipation through the endocranial surface in fossil specimens.\nThrough angiotomography, it is possible to make an anatomical reconstruction of the meningeal and cerebral vessels, providing information on the morphology of the endocranial vascular system. At the same time, digital modeling can be performed to investigate the relationships between the endocranial geometry and physical properties such as heat dissipation patterns in extinct hominids.\nThe middle meningeal network is largely independent from the cerebral vascular system. Furthermore, in adults, the medium and upper tracts of the middle meningeal artery shows scarce or absent blood flow. Parietal bossing in modern humans involves relative cooling of the cortical surface at the supramarginal gyrus.\nThe evidence does not support a thermoregulatory role for the meningeal vascular network, at least in adult normal blood flow conditions.

In the light of numerous studies presented during recent times, which show that human periodontal ligament cells also produce cytokines and chemokines in response to inflammation promoters, it is reasonable to suggest that periodontal ligament cells play a role as promoters of periodontal inflammation through these mechanisms.\nThe periodontal ligament, which harbours the periodontal ligament cells, is a part of the attachment apparatus comprised of periodontal ligament cells, extracellular matrix and fibres, attaching the root cement to the alveolar bone. Periodontal ligament cells are in close proximity to bacteria within the plaque and the pocket, and thus these cells are readily accessible to bacterial endotoxins and other promoters of inflammation.\nCytokines and chemokines, released by periodontal ligament cells upon stimulation with inflammation promoters, reach the blood vessels easily thanks to rich vascularization of the periodontium stimulating recruitment of white blood cells to the site of inflammation. In addition to classical inflammatory cells, such as leucocytes, macrophages and mast cells, the periodontal ligament cells also contribute to periodontal inflammation via their production and release of cytokines and chemokines.\nTherefore, pharmacological treatment of periodontitis should aim to reduce the release of proinflammatory agents not only from classical inflammatory cells but also from periodontal ligament cells.", "journal": "Journal of periodontal research", "date": "2010-12-02", "authors": ["DJ\u00f6nsson", "DNebel", "GBratthall", "B-ONilsson"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0765.2010.01331.x"}

Here, we identified suppressed formation of a novel reparative lipid mediator 14S,21R-dihydroxydocosa-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid (14S,21R-diHDHA) in cutaneous wounds of diabetic db/db mice. These results indicate that diabetes impedes the biosynthetic pathways of 14S,21R-diHDHA in skin wounds. Administration of exogenous 14S,21R-diHDHA to wounds in diabetic animals rescued healing and angiogenesis. When db/db mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were administered together with 14S,21R-diHDHA to wounds in diabetic animals, they coacted to accelerate wound re-epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and synergistically improved vascularization. In the pivotal cellular processes of angiogenesis, 14S,21R-diHDHA enhanced VEGF release, vasculature formation, and migration of db/db dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVECs), as well as remedied paracrine angiogenic functions of db/db MSCs, including VEGF secretion and the promotion of DMVEC migration and vasculature formation. Our results show that 14S,21R-diHDHA activates the p38 MAPK pathway in wounds, db/db MSCs, and DMVECs. Overall, the impeded formation of 14S,21R-diHDHA described in this study suggests that diabetes could affect the generation of pro-healing lipid mediators in wound healing. By restoring wound healing and MSC functions, 14S,21R-diHDHA is a new lead for the development of better therapeutics used in treating wounds of diabetics.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2010-11-30", "authors": ["HaibinTian", "YanLu", "Shraddha PShah", "SongHong"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M110.100388"}

We have previously shown that S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) increases the expression of several muscular markers and VEGF in mesenchymal stem cells, indicating that transplantation of SNAP-treated cells could provide better functional outcomes. Here, we transplanted SNAP-treated adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in rat infarcted myocardium. After 30days, we observed a significant improvement of the ejection fraction in rats that received SNAP-treated ADSCs, compared with those that received untreated cells (p=0.008). Immunohistochemical reactions showed an increased expression of troponin T-C and von Willebrand factor, and organized vascular units in the infarcted area of tissue transplanted with treated ADSCs. SNAP exposure induced intracellular S-nitrosation, a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, but did not increase cGMP levels. Collectively, these results indicate that SNAP alters the redox environment of ADSCs, possibly associated with a pre-differentiation state, which may improve cardiac function after transplantation.", "journal": "Experimental and molecular pathology", "date": "2010-11-30", "authors": ["Gel R MBerardi", "Carmen KRebelatto", "Helo\u00edsa FTavares", "MaxIngberman", "Patr\u00edciaShigunov", "FabianeBarchiki", "Alessandra MAguiar", "Nelson IMiyague", "Julio CFrancisco", "AlejandroCorrea", "Alexandra CSenegaglia", "Paula HansenSuss", "Jos\u00e9 AMoutinho", "Vanessa SSotomaior", "Lia SNakao", "Paulo SBrofman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexmp.2010.11.005"}
{"title": "GLUT-1 staining of squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix identifies a novel element of invasion.", "abstract": "Perturbation of the normal tissue architecture in solid malignant tumors is perceived to be the consequence of actively migrating cancer cells which invade the adjacent normal host tissue. The opposite, invasion of cancer cell clusters by a vascularized stroma, has not been considered. The latter process should, however, be expected to occur since the hypoxic cores of tumor cell aggregates, under the control of HIF-1, are known to secrete cytokines (e.g., bFGF, VEGF) which attract fibroblasts and induce blood vessel formation. In this study, the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)-1, a major HIF-1 target gene, was examined in 51 squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix by immunohistochemistry to identify the localization of hypoxic tumor cell areas. The relationship of the expression pattern of GLUT-1 with the localization and morphology of the tumor stroma was analyzed. We identified three recurrent histological signs which represent strong evidence in favor of an invasion of solid tumor masses by actively migrating stromal cells. According to our findings, the histological structure of squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix may in part result from the interplay between the inherent tendency of neoplastic epithelial cells to expand in the form of coherent aggregates and the fragmentation of these aggregates by invading, finger- or wedge-like stromal protrusions which carry new blood vessels, driven by gradients of hypoxia-induced pro-angiogenic, pro-migratory and growth-promoting molecules emanating from the hypoxic core.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "2010-11-27", "authors": ["ArnulfMayer", "MichaelH\u00f6ckel", "Lars-ChristianHorn", "HeinzSchmidberger", "PeterVaupel"], "doi": null}

The tensile strength of scaffolds was 18 \u00b1 5 N/cm(2). Scaffolds were relatively stable in a phosphate buffer but degraded in oxidizing environment after 11 weeks of incubation. Applicability of the recombinant spidroin 1 as a substrate for cell culture was demonstrated by successful 3T3 cells growth on the surface of rS1/9 films (270 \u00b1 20 cells/mm(2) vs. 97 \u00b1 8 cells/mm(2) on the glass surface, p < 0.01). The 3T3 fibroblasts readily proliferated within the rS1/9 scaffold (from initially plated 19 \u00b1 2 cells/mm(3) to 3800 \u00b1 304 cells/mm(3) after 2 weeks). By this time, cells were uniformly distributed between the surface and deeper layers (27% \u00b1 8% and 33% \u00b1 4%, respectively; p > 0.05), whereas the initial distribution was 58% \u00b1 7% and 11% \u00b1 8%, respectively; p < 0.05).

Angiogenesis inhibitors have been targeted for the treatment of various cancers for more than 2 decades. We have developed a novel class of steroidal compounds aimed at blocking the angiogenic process in cancerous tissues. Our lead compound, SR16388, is a potent antiangiogenic agent with binding affinity to estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) and -\u03b2 (ER-\u03b2) at the nanomolar range. This compound inhibited the proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and various types of human cancer cells in vitro. SR16388 inhibited embryonic angiogenesis as measured in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The blood vessel density in the CAM was greatly reduced after the embryos were treated with 3\u00a0\u03bcg/CAM of SR16388 for 24\u00a0h. SR16388 at a dose of 2\u00a0\u03bcM prevented tube formation in Matrigel after HMVEC cells were treated for 8\u00a0h. In a modified Boyden chamber assay, SR16388 inhibited the migration of HMVECs by 80% at 500\u00a0nM. Using a novel in vivo Fibrin Z-chamber model, we demonstrated that SR16388 at a single daily oral dose of 3\u00a0mg/kg for 12 days significantly inhibited the granulation tissue (GT) thickness and the microvessel density of the GT as compared to control. More importantly, SR16388 down-regulated the pro-angiogenic transcription factors, hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.

Hence, we investigated the role of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, as novel therapeutic targets against NSCLC. We observed expression of CB1 (24%) and CB2 (55%) in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, we have shown that the treatment of NSCLC cell lines (A549 and SW-1573) with CB1/CB2- and CB2-specific agonists Win55,212-2 and JWH-015, respectively, significantly attenuated random as well as growth factor-directed in vitro chemotaxis and chemoinvasion in these cells. We also observed significant reduction in focal adhesion complex, which plays an important role in migration, upon treatment with both JWH-015 and Win55,212-2. In addition, pretreatment with CB1/CB2 selective antagonists, AM251 and AM630, prior to JWH-015 and Win55,212-2 treatments, attenuated the agonist-mediated inhibition of in vitro chemotaxis and chemoinvasion. In addition, both CB1 and CB2 agonists Win55,212-2 and JWH-133, respectively, significantly inhibited in vivo tumor growth and lung metastasis (\u223c50%). These effects were receptor mediated, as pretreatment with CB1/CB2 antagonists abrogated CB1/CB2 agonist-mediated effects on tumor growth and metastasis. Reduced proliferation and vascularization, along with increased apoptosis, were observed in tumors obtained from animals treated with JWH-133 and Win55,212-2. Upon further elucidation into the molecular mechanism, we observed that both CB1 and CB2 agonists inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, a key signaling molecule controlling cell survival, migration, and apoptosis, and reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression and activity.

Results are given for how the different strategies of seeding the pore with cells affects the extent of vascularisation. Also simulations are made to compare results where the values of different model parameters are varied such as the pore dimensions, the density of endothelial cells seeded into the pore, and the release rate of growth factor from the scaffold into the pore.

In particular, the vascularized fibula head graft is preferred for patients with bone defects of the upper limb involving the distal radius or the proximal humerus. The aim of the present study was to analyze the operative results, complications, and postoperative function after vascularized fibula head graft transfer and the indications for this procedure.\nFrom 1998 through 2008, vascularized fibula head graft transfer was performed in eight patients to reconstruct bone defects following resection of tumors of the upper limb. The primary site of the tumor was the proximal humerus in four patients and the distal radius in four patients. The postoperative course of the transferred bone was examined, and functional results were evaluated.\nAll vascularized fibula head grafts were transferred successfully. During the follow-up period, absorption of the transferred fibula head was not observed. The mean overall functional rating of the reconstructed shoulder joint was 70 percent. The range of motion of the reconstructed wrist joint showed no specific patterns, and instability of the wrist joint was observed in only one case.\nThe authors believe that the vascularized fibula head graft transfer is a safe and reliable method for reconstructing the upper limb, especially for patients with a defect of the distal radius or the proximal humerus.

{"title": "A bilayer construct controls adipose-derived stem cell differentiation into endothelial cells and pericytes without growth factor stimulation.", "abstract": "This work describes the differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) in a composite hydrogel for use as a vascularized dermal matrix. Our intent is that such a construct could be utilized following large-surface-area burn wounds that require extensive skin grafting and that are limited by the availability of uninjured sites. To develop engineered skin replacement constructs, we are pursuing the use of ASC. We have established that a PEGylated fibrin gel can provide a suitable environment for the proliferation of ASC over a 7 day time course. Further, we have demonstrated that PEGylated fibrin can be used to control ASC differentiation toward vascular cell types, including cells characteristic of both endothelial cells and pericytes. Gene expression analysis revealed strong upregulation of endothelial markers, CD31, and von Willebrand factor, up to day 11 in culture with corresponding evidence of protein expression demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining. ASC were not only shown to express endothelial cell phenotype, but a subset of the ASC expressed pericyte markers. The NG2 gene was upregulated over 11 days with corresponding evidence for the cell surface marker. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta gene expression decreased as the multipotent ASC differentiated up to day 7. Increased receptor expression at day 11 was likely due to the enhanced pericyte gene expression profile, including increased NG2 expression. We have also demonstrated that when cells are loaded onto chitosan microspheres and sandwiched between the PEGylated fibrin gel and a type I collagen gel, the cells can migrate and proliferate within the two different gel types. The matrix composition dictates the lineage specification and is not driven by soluble factors. Utilizing an insoluble bilayer matrix to direct ASC differentiation will allow for the development of both vasculature as well as dermal connective tissue from a single population of ASC.

In rare cases, the disorder can cause obstruction of atrial inflow, causing symptoms of heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmias resulting from the involvement of the atrial wall and atrioventricular conduction pathways.\n\u2002 We present a case of a Caucasian 66-year-old man with urothelial carcinoma where transthoracic echocardiolography showed a mass in the basal part of the interatrial septum. After injection of echo contrast, it was suggested that the structure was vascularized, thus implying tumour. Transoesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging gave the correct diagnosis of lipomatous hypertrophy. It was then discovered that the patient had been referred to a computed tomography (CT) earlier, but no mention of the mass was found in the report from the examination. Re-evaluation of the images showed a clearly visible mass indicative of fatty tissue.\n\u2002 This case report highlights the importance of multi-modality imaging when the findings are not concordant. Moreover, this case report also highlights the importance of careful examination of the heart on routine CT scans, something that is often overlooked by the radiologists.

Progress made in cell and stem cell biology, material sciences and tissue engineering enabled researchers to develop cutting-edge technology which has lead to the creation of nonmodular tissue constructs such as skin, bladders, vessels and upper airways. In all cases, autologous cells were seeded on either artificial or natural supporting scaffolds. However, such constructs were implanted without the reconstruction of the vascular supply, and the nutrients and oxygen were supplied by diffusion from adjacent tissues. Engineering of modular organs (namely, organs organized in functioning units referred to as modules and requiring the reconstruction of the vascular supply) is more complex and challenging. Models of functioning hearts and livers have been engineered using \"natural tissue\" scaffolds and efforts are underway to produce kidneys, pancreata and small intestine. Creation of custom-made bioengineered organs, where the cellular component is exquisitely autologous and have an internal vascular network, will theoretically overcome the two major hurdles in transplantation, namely the shortage of organs and the toxicity deriving from lifelong immunosuppression.

In this study, porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM) was used to guide human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) adhesion and proliferation as a potential system for vascularization of engineered tissues. We fabricated PADM using a modified protocol and assessed their composition and ultrastructures. Subsequently, the viability of HUVECs and the formation of capillary-like networks were evaluated by seeding cells directly on PADM scaffolds or PADM digests in vitro. We further investigated the function of the HUVECs seeded on the PADM scaffolds after subcutaneous transplantation in athymic mice. Moreover, the function of the neovessels formed in the PADM scaffolds was assessed by implantation into cutaneous wounds on the backs of mice. The results showed that PADM scaffolds significantly increased proliferation of HUVECs, and the PADM digest induced HUVECs formed many tube-like structures. Moreover, HUVECs seeded on the PADM scaffolds formed numerous capillary-like networks and some perfused vascular structures after implantation into mice. PADM seeded with HUVECs and fibroblasts were also able to form many capillary-like networks in vitro. Further, these neovessels could inosculate with the murine vasculature after implantation into cutaneous wounds in mice. The advantage of this method is that the decellularized matrix not only provides signals to maintain the viability of endothelial cells but also serves as the template structure for regenerated tissue.

They underwent transvaginal two-dimensional gray-scale and power Doppler ultrasound examination of the endometrium. The ultrasound image showing the most vascularized section through the endometrium as assessed by power Doppler was frozen, the endometrium was outlined and the percentage vascularized area (vascularity index) was calculated using computer software. The ultrasound examiner also estimated the color content of the endometrial scan on a visual analog scale (VAS) graded from 0 to 100 (VAS score). A structured history was taken to collect clinical information. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to create mathematical models to predict endometrial malignancy.\nThere were 63 (24%) malignant and 198 (76%) benign endometria. Women with a malignant endometrium were older (median age 74 vs. 65 years; P = 0.0005) and fewer used hormone replacement therapy and warfarin. Women with a malignant endometrium had a thicker endometrium (median thickness 20.8 vs. 10.2 mm; P = 0.0005) and higher values for vascularity index and VAS score. When using only clinical data to build a model for estimating the risk of endometrial malignancy, a model including the variables age, use of warfarin and use of hormone replacement therapy had the largest area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC), with a value of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.67-0.81).

We have previously shown that PEDF can be phosphorylated and that distinct phosphorylations differentially regulate its physiological functions. We also demonstrated that triple phosphomimetic mutant (EEE-PEDF), has significantly increased antiangiogenic activity and is much more efficient than WT-PEDF in inhibiting neovascularization and tumor growth. The enhanced antiangiogenic effect was associated with a direct ability to facilitate apoptosis of tumor-residing endothelial cells (ECs), and subsequently, disruption of intratumoral vascularization. In the present report, we elucidated the molecular mechanism by which EEE-PEDF exerts more profound effects at the cellular level. We found that EEE-PEDF suppresses EC proliferation due to caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and also inhibits migration of the EC much better than WT-PEDF. Although WT-PEDF and EEE-PEDF did not affect proliferation and did not induce apoptosis of cancer cells, these agents efficiently inhibited cancer cell motility, with EEE-PEDF showing a stronger effect. The stronger activity of EEE-PEDF was correlated with a better binding to laminin receptors. Furthermore, the proapoptotic and antimigratory activities of WT-PEDF and EEE-PEDF were found regulated by differential activation of two distinct MAPK pathways, namely JNK and p38, respectively. We show that JNK and p38 phosphorylation is much higher in cells treated with EEE-PEDF. JNK leads to apoptosis of ECs, whereas p38 leads to anti-migratory effect in both EC and cancer cells.

However, the main impediment for the oral delivery of these drugs as potential therapeutic agents is their extensive pre-systemic metabolism, instability in acidic environment resulting into inadequate and erratic oral absorption. Parenteral route of administration is the only established route that overcomes all these drawbacks associated with these orally less/inefficient drugs. But, these formulations are costly, have least patient compliance, require repeated administration, in addition to the other hazardous effects associated with this route. Over the last few decades pharmaceutical scientists throughout the world are trying to explore transdermal and transmucosal routes as an alternative to injections. Historically, oral transmucosal drug delivery has received intensive interest since ancient times for the most widely utilized route of administration for the systemic delivery of drugs. In more recent years, better systemic bioavailability of many drugs has been achieved by oromucosal route. Among the various transmucosal sites available, soft-palatal mucosa was also found to be the most convenient and easily accessible novel site for the delivery of therapeutic agents for systemic delivery as retentive dosage forms, because it has abundant vascularization and rapid cellular recovery time after exposure to stress. Smooth surface of the soft palate and its good flexibility are prerequisites to prevent mechanical irritation and local discomfort. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the most promising advances in novel non-invasive soft-palatal route and the conceptual and technical approaches to the design and formulation of soft-palatal drug delivery systems.

This signaling system is required for normal vascular development in the retina and for vascular survival in the cochlea.

Here, we characterize Ndp expression during mouse development by studying a knock-in mouse that carries the coding sequence of human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) inserted at the Ndp locus (Ndp(AP)). In the CNS, Ndp(AP) expression is apparent by E10.5 and is dynamic and complex. The anatomically delimited regions of Ndp(AP) expression observed prenatally in the CNS are replaced postnatally by widespread expression in astrocytes in the forebrain and midbrain, Bergman glia in the cerebellum, and M\u00fcller glia in the retina. In the developing and adult cochlea, Ndp(AP) expression is closely associated with two densely vascularized regions, the stria vascularis and a capillary plexus between the organ of Corti and the spiral ganglion.

{"title": "Endothelial von Willebrand factor regulates angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The regulation of blood vessel formation is of fundamental importance to many physiological processes, and angiogenesis is a major area for novel therapeutic approaches to diseases from ischemia to cancer. A poorly understood clinical manifestation of pathological angiogenesis is angiodysplasia, vascular malformations that cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Angiodysplasia can be associated with von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common bleeding disorder in man. VWD is caused by a defect or deficiency in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein essential for normal hemostasis that is involved in inflammation. We hypothesized that VWF regulates angiogenesis. Inhibition of VWF expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in endothelial cells (ECs) caused increased in vitro angiogenesis and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-dependent proliferation and migration, coupled to decreased integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 levels and increased angiopoietin (Ang)-2 release. ECs expanded from blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells of VWD patients confirmed these results. Finally, 2 different approaches, in situ and in vivo, showed increased vascularization in VWF-deficient mice. We therefore identify a new function of VWF in ECs, which confirms VWF as a protein with multiple vascular roles and defines a novel link between hemostasis and angiogenesis.

This model predicts blood pressure, blood flow and hematocrit distributions, volumes of functional vascular territories, regional flow at voxel and network scales, etc. Using the same approach, we study flow reorganizations induced by global arteriolar vasodilations (an isometabolic global increase in cerebral blood flow). For small to moderate global vasodilations, the relationship between changes in volume and changes in flow is in close agreement with Grubb's law, providing a quantitative tool for studying the variations of its exponent with underlying vascular architecture. A significant correlation between blood flow and vascular structure at the voxel scale, practically unchanged with respect to baseline, is demonstrated. Furthermore, the effects of localized arteriolar vasodilations, representative of a local increase in metabolic demand, are analyzed. In particular, localized vasodilations induce flow changes, including vascular steal, in the neighboring arteriolar trunks at small distances (<300 \u03bcm), while their influence in the neighboring veins is much larger (about 1 mm), which provides an estimate of the vascular point spread function.

Here we examined the impact of bim deficiency on postnatal retinal vascularization, as well as retinal neovascularization during oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR) and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. Loss of bim expression was associated with increased retinal vascular density in mature animals. This was mainly attributed to increased numbers of pericytes and endothelial cells. However, the initial spread of the superficial layer of retinal vasculature and, the appearance and density of the tip cells were similar in bim+/+ and bim-/- mice. In addition, hyaloid vessel regression was attenuated in the absence of bim. Furthermore, in the absence of bim retinal vessel obliteration and neovascularization did not occur during OIR. Instead, normal inner retinal vascularization proceeded independent of changes in oxygen levels. In contrast, choroidal neovascularization occurred equally well in bim+/+ and bim-/- mice.

These tumors are generally diagnosed at an early stage but there is a high risk of recurrence, associated with high mortality. Treatment of recurrent GCTs is difficult, and biologically targeted treatment modalities are lacking. GCTs are highly vascularized, and angiogenic factors most probably play a role in their pathology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of tumor angiogenesis, but in GCTs, the role of VEGF and its receptors VEGFR-1 (FLT1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR) remains largely unknown. Our objective is to study the expression of VEGF and its receptors in human GCTs.\nWe analyzed GCTs from 106 patients for the expressions of VEGF and its receptors utilizing tumor tissue microarray, tumor mRNA, and patient serum samples.\nWe found that VEGF and its main biologically active receptor VEGFR-2 were highly expressed in primary and recurrent GCTs, when compared with normal granulosa-lutein cells. The expression of VEGF correlated positively to tumor microvessel density and to VEGFR-2 expression at the protein (P<0.05) and mRNA (P<0.05) levels. In contrast to VEGFR-2, the expression of VEGFR-1 was weak. Tumor VEGF protein expression was not prognostic for recurrence, however, we found high levels of circulating VEGF in the serum of patients with primary GCT.\nThe results suggest an important role of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in GCT pathology and support the possibility of applying novel VEGF- or VEGFR-2-targeted treatments to patients with GCT.", "journal": "European journal of endocrinology", "date": "2010-11-03", "authors": ["AnniinaF\u00e4rkkil\u00e4", "MikkoAnttonen", "JuratePociuviene", "ArtoLeminen", "RalfButzow", "MarkkuHeikinheimo", "LeilaUnkila-Kallio"], "doi": "10.1530/EJE-10-0849"}
{"title": "Multiscale modeling of bone tissue with surface and permeability control.", "abstract": "Natural biological materials usually present a hierarchical arrangement with various structural levels. The biomechanical behavior of the complex hierarchical structure of bone is investigated with models that address the various levels corresponding to different scales. Models that simulate the bone remodeling process concurrently at different scales are in development. We present a multiscale model for bone tissue adaptation that considers the two top levels, whole bone and trabecular architecture. The bone density distribution is calculated at the macroscale (whole bone) level, and the trabecular structure at the microscale level takes into account its mechanical properties as well as surface density and permeability. The bone remodeling process is thus formulated as a material distribution problem at both scales. At the local level, the biologically driven information of surface density and permeability characterizes the trabecular structure. The model is tested by a three-dimensional simulation of bone tissue adaptation for the human femur. The density distribution of the model shows good agreement with the actual bone density distribution. Permeability at the microstructural level assures interconnectivity of pores, which mimics the interconnectivity of trabecular bone essential for vascularization and transport of nutrients. The importance of this multiscale model relays on the flexibility to control the morphometric parameters that characterize the trabecular structure. Therefore, the presented model can be a valuable tool to define bone quality, to assist with diagnosis of osteoporosis, and to support the development of bone substitutes.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2010-11-03", "authors": ["PedroGon\u00e7alves Coelho", "PauloRui Fernandes", "HelderCarri\u00e7o Rodrigues"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.10.007"}

Covalent immobilization may be preferred over controlled release or cell transfection if the effects are desired within the biomaterial rather than the surrounding tissue.

In addition to rapid vascularization, an effective cardiac patch should exhibit neither thinning nor dilatation upon implantation. In vitro, VEGF enhanced the growth of endothelial and bone marrow cells seeded onto scaffolds. In vivo, High VEGF patches had greater blood vessel density (p < 0.01) than control at Day 7 and 28 due to increased cell recruitment and proliferation (p < 0.05 vs. control). At Day 28, VEGF-treated patches were significantly thicker (p < 0.05) than control, and thickness correlated positively with neovascularization (r = 0.67, p = 0.023).

We found that CXCL4L1 has lower affinity for heparin and chondroitin sulfate-E than platelet factor-4 (CXCL4) and showed that CXCL10 and CXCL4L1 could displace each other on microvascular endothelial cells. Labeled CXCL4L1 also bound to CXCR3A- and CXCR3B-transfectants and was displaced by CXCL4L1, CXCL4, and CXCL10. The CXCL4L1 anti-angiogenic activity was blocked by anti-CXCR3 antibodies (Abs) in the Matrigel and cornea micropocket assays. CXCL4L1 application in CXCR3(-/-) or in wild-type mice treated with neutralizing anti-CXCR3 Abs, resulted in reduced inhibitory activity of CXCL4L1 on tumor growth and vascularization of Lewis lung carcinoma. Furthermore, CXCL4L1 and CXCL4 chemoattracted activated T cells, human natural killer cells, and human immature dendritic cells (DCs). Migration of DCs toward CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 was desensitized by preincubation with CXCL10 and CXCL11, inhibited by pertussis toxin, and neutralized by anti-CXCR3 Abs. Chemotaxis of T cells, natural killer cells, and DCs is likely to contribute to the antitumoral action. However, the in vivo data indicate that the angiostatic property of CXCL4L1 is equally important in retarding tumor growth.

{"title": "Modulation of CD4+ T lymphocyte lineage outcomes with targeted, nanoparticle-mediated cytokine delivery.", "abstract": "Within the immune system there is an exquisite ability to discriminate between \"self\" and \"non-self\" that is orchestrated by antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Genomic plasticity enables differentiation of naive CD4+ T lymphocytes into either regulatory cells (Treg) that express the transcription factor Foxp3 and actively prevent autoimmune self-destruction or effector cells (Teff) that attack and destroy their cognate target. An example of such plasticity is our recent discovery that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) supports Treg maturation in contrast to IL-6, which drives development of the pathogenic Th17 effector phenotype. This has revealed a LIF/IL6 axis in T cell development which can be exploited for modulation using targeted cytokine delivery. Here we demonstrate that LIF-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) directed to CD4+ T cells (i) oppose IL6-driven Th17 development; (ii) prolong survival of vascularized heart grafts in mice; and (iii) expand FOXP3+ CD4+ T cell numbers in a non-human primate model in vitro. In contrast, IL-6 loaded nanoparticles directed to CD4+ T cells increase Th17 development. Notably, nanoparticle-mediated delivery was demonstrated to be critical: unloaded nanoparticles and soluble LIF or IL-6 controls failed to recapitulate the efficacy of cytokine-loaded nanoparticles in induction and/or expansion of Foxp3+ cells or Th17 cells. Thus, this targeted nanoparticle approach is able to harness endogenous immune-regulatory pathways, providing a powerful new method to modulating T cell developmental plasticity in immune-mediated disease indications.", "journal": "Molecular pharmaceutics", "date": "2010-10-28", "authors": ["JasonPark", "WendaGao", "RoyWhiston", "Terry BStrom", "SuMetcalfe", "Tarek MFahmy"], "doi": "10.1021/mp100203a"}

However, the basic science regarding degenerative changes of the vertebral endplate and its actions on the IVD is lacking. The endplate is responsible for nutrient flow to the IVD through diffusion. It has been postulated that changes in the endplate may be responsible for the degeneration of the IVD.\nTwenty New Zealand white rabbits were equally divided into 4 groups as follows; group A, 28 days of compression only; group B, 28 days of disc compression followed by 28 days of unloading; group C, 28 days of disc compression followed by 28 days of distraction; and group D, sham operated animals with apparatus placement only. At the end of the study, all the animals in the 4 groups were killed and the lumbar segments harvested for analysis of their disc height, vascularity, and histologic examination.\nCompression decreased the disc height and the rabbits showed signs of disc degeneration. Ossified endplates with decreased cells and extracellular matrix, and decreased vascular channel volume were observed. Cellular and morphologic regeneration were observed on unloading and distraction of the compressed discs, although the cartilaginous endplates were partially ossified. The volume of vascular channels increased significantly after distraction. Fluorescent vascular tracer showed the presence of active blood flow in the vascular channels near the cartilaginous endplates.\nCompression resulted in degeneration of the cartilaginous endplate and decrease in the osseous endplate vascular channel volume, both of which led to the degeneration of the IVD.

{"title": "Support of a free radical mechanism for enhanced antitumor efficacy of the microtubule disruptor OXi4503.", "abstract": "Unlike normal blood vessels, the unique characteristics of an expanding, disorganized and leaky tumor vascular network can be targeted for therapeutic gain by vascular disrupting agents (VDAs), which promote rapid and selective collapse of tumor vessels, causing extensive secondary cancer cell death. A hallmark observation following VDA treatment is the survival of neoplastic cells at the tumor periphery. However, comparative studies with the second generation tubulin-binding VDA OXi4503 indicate that the viable rim of tumor tissue remaining following treatment with this agent is significantly smaller than that seen for the lead VDA, combretastatin. OXi4503 is the cis-isomer of CA1P and it has been speculated that this agent's increased antitumor efficacy may be due to its reported metabolism to orthoquinone intermediates leading to the formation of cytotoxic free radicals. To examine this possibility in situ, KHT sarcoma-bearing mice were treated with either the cis- or trans-isomer of CA1P. Since both isomers can form quinone intermediates but only the cis-isomer binds tubulin, such a comparison allows the effects of vascular collapse to be evaluated independently from those caused by the reactive hydroxyl groups. The results showed that the cis-isomer (OXi4503) significantly impaired tumor blood flow leading to secondary tumor cell death and >95% tumor necrosis 24h post drug exposure. Treatment with the trans-isomer had no effect on these parameters. However, the combination of the trans-isomer with combretastatin increased the antitumor efficacy of the latter agent to near that of OXi4503. These findings indicate that while the predominant in vivo effect of OXi4503 is clearly due to microtubule collapse and vascular shut-down, the formation of toxic free radicals likely contributes to its enhanced potency.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2010-10-27", "authors": ["LoriRice", "ChristinePampo", "SharonLepler", "Amyn MRojiani", "Dietmar WSiemann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2010.10.003"}

Herein, we analyzed whether cultivation of prevascularized tissue constructs promotes inosculation by reducing the perivascular cell coverage of the preformed microvessels. Poly(ester-urethane) scaffolds were implanted into FVB/N-TgN (Tie2/green fluorescent protein [GFP]) 287 Sato mice to generate prevascularized tissue constructs with GFP-positive microvessels. These constructs were then cultivated for 3 or 10 days before implantation into dorsal skinfold chambers of FVB/N mice to analyze inosculation and vascularization by intravital fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Noncultivated tissue constructs served as controls. Cultivation reduced the number of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive preformed microvessels within the constructs and increased the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. After 3 days of cultivation, tissue constructs still exhibited good cell viability, whereas apoptotic cell death was massively increased in the 10-day-cultivated group. After implantation, inosculation of preformed microvessels was accelerated in the 3-day-cultivated constructs. This resulted in an improved vascularization, as indicated by an increased functional microvessel density and blood perfusion. Immunohistochemical detection of GFP-positive microvessels revealed that internal and external inosculation occurs in parallel. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that inosculation of in situ prevascularized tissue constructs can be easily accelerated by destabilization of preformed microvessels and angiogenic activation during short-term cultivation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Expansion and hepatocytic differentiation of liver progenitor cells in vivo using a vascularized tissue engineering chamber in mice.", "abstract": "Current cell-based treatment alternatives to organ transplantation for liver failure remain unsatisfactory. Hepatocytes have a strong tendency to dedifferentiate and apoptose when isolated and maintained in culture. In contrast, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) are robust, easy to culture and have been shown to replace damaged hepatocytes in liver disease. In this study we investigate whether isolated LPCs can survive and differentiate toward mature hepatocytes in vivo when implanted into a heterotopic mouse tissue engineering chamber model. Healthy Balb/c mice and those put on a choline-deficient ethionin-supplemented diet to induce chronic liver disease were implanted with a tissue engineering chamber based on the epigastric flow through pedicle model, containing either 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) LPCs suspended in Matrigel, or LPC-spheroids produced by preculture for 1 week in Matrigel. Four weeks after implantation the chamber contents were harvested. In all four groups, progenitor cells persisted in large numbers to 4 weeks and demonstrated evidence of considerable proliferation judged by Ki67-positive cells. Periodic acid Schiff staining demonstrated differentiation of some cells into mature hepatocytes. Constructs grown from LPC-spheroids demonstrated considerably greater LPC survival than those from LPCs that were grown as monolayers and implanted as dissociated cells. The combined use of LPC spheroids and the vascularized chamber model could be the basis for a viable alternative to current treatments for chronic liver failure.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Review: cerebral microvascular pathology in ageing and neurodegeneration.", "abstract": "This review of age-related brain microvascular pathologies focuses on topics studied by this laboratory, including anatomy of the blood supply, tortuous vessels, venous collagenosis, capillary remnants, vascular density and microembolic brain injury. Our studies feature thick sections, large blocks embedded in celloidin, and vascular staining by alkaline phosphatase. This permits study of the vascular network in three dimensions, and the differentiation of afferent from efferent vessels. Current evidence suggests that there is decreased vascular density in ageing, Alzheimer's disease and leukoaraiosis, and cerebrovascular dysfunction precedes and accompanies cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration. A decline in cerebrovascular angiogenesis may inhibit recovery from hypoxia-induced capillary loss. Cerebral blood flow is inhibited by tortuous arterioles and deposition of excessive collagen in veins and venules. Misery perfusion due to capillary loss appears to occur before cell loss in leukoaraiosis, and cerebral blood flow is also reduced in the normal-appearing white matter. Hypoperfusion occurs early in Alzheimer's disease, inducing white matter lesions and correlating with dementia. In vascular dementia, cholinergic reductions are correlated with cognitive impairment, and cholinesterase inhibitors have some benefit. Most lipid microemboli from cardiac surgery pass through the brain in a few days, but some remain for weeks. They can cause what appears to be a type of vascular dementia years after surgery. Donepezil has shown some benefit. Emboli, such as clots, cholesterol crystals and microspheres can be extruded through the walls of cerebral vessels, but there is no evidence yet that lipid emboli undergo such extravasation.", "journal": "Neuropathology and applied neurobiology", "date": "2010-10-16", "authors": ["W RBrown", "C RThore"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2990.2010.01139.x"}

In this study, the collagen membrane was activated with the engineered human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). To enhance the binding of bFGF to collagen membranes, a specific peptide of collagen-binding domain (CBD) was fused to the N-terminal of bFGF. After implantation, little adhesion was caused in collagen/CBD-bFGF, collagen/NAT-bFGF and collagen/PBS groups. Moreover, collagen/CBD-bFGF group could effectively promote the vascularization at 30 d after surgery and significantly accelerate the integration of myofibers into the collagen material at 90 d after surgery compared to the other two groups. Due to the replacement of the myofibers in materials, the mechanical strength of implanted biomaterials in collagen/CBD-bFGF group was also greater than the other two groups at 90 d after surgery.

{"title": "Engineered human tumor xenografts with functional human vascular networks.", "abstract": "Animal models of human tumor angiogenesis would have multiple applications. However, they are extremely difficult to standardize. In this work, we tried to generate human tumor xenografts containing a human vascular bed in immunodeficient mice by subcutaneous co-implantation of matrigel-embedded human endothelial cells (EC), human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as a source of mural cells and HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. Unfortunately, in this context human EC were rapidly substituted by their murine counterparts, and by day 16 post-implantation human CD34 positive cells were hardly detectable in intratumoral vessels. In an attempt to inhibit host EC colonization of human xenografts and promote human EC grafting, we investigated the effect of radiation prior to implantation on the vascularization and growth of tumor xenografts. Nude mice underwent either localized (implantation area) or sublethal whole-body exposure to radiation. Localized radiation inhibited both human and murine neovascularization, and even the tumor growth rate was remarkably decreased when compared to control unirradiated mice and sublethally whole-body irradiated mice. Interestingly, numerous human vessels were detectable in sublethally irradiated mice at day 30, with murine EC only over passing human EC when spontaneous hematopoietic reconstitution has taken place. This observation strongly suggests the implication of bone marrow-derived murine endothelial precursors in tumor neovascularization. In summary, we have established a model of human tumor neovascularization that is amenable to both the study of molecular aspects in the angiogenic process and the evaluation of potential new antiangiogenic drugs.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2010-10-12", "authors": ["VanesaAlonso-Camino", "PatriciaSantos-Valle", "Maria CarmenIspizua", "LauraSanz", "Lu\u00edsAlvarez-Vallina"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2010.10.002"}

Several efforts, including cellular and acellular technologies, have been made to induce vascular growth in scaffolds. However, thus far, there is no established technology for inducing vascular growth. The aim of this study was to promote the vascularization capacities of scaffolds by seeding adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on them and to compare the vascularization capacities of different scaffolds seeded with ADSCs. Two kinds of extracellular matrix scaffolds (small intestinal submucosa [SIS] and acellular dermal matrix [ADM]) and a kind of composite scaffold (collagen-chondroitin sulfate-hyaluronic acid [Co-CS-HA]) were selected. Subcutaneous implantation analysis showed that the vascularization capacity of SIS and ADM was greater than that of Co-CS-HA. ADSCs seeded in SIS and ADM secreted greater amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor than those seeded in Co-CS-HA. In a murine skin injury model, ADSC-seeded scaffolds enhanced the angiogenesis and wound healing rate compared with the nonseeded scaffolds. Moreover, ADSC-SIS and ADSC-ADM had greater vascularization capacity than that of ADSC-Co-CS-HA. Taken together, these results suggest that ADSCs could be used as a cell source to promote the vascularization capacities of scaffolds. The vascularization capacities of ADSC-seeded scaffolds were influenced by both the vascularization capacities of the scaffolds themselves and their effects on the angiogenic potential of ADSCs; the combination of extracellular matrix scaffolds and ADSCs exhibited synergistic angiogenesis promoting effects.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The main problems with this approach include pain and discomfort associated with harvesting autologous tissue, limited availability of donor sites, and the need for multiple surgeries. Although tissue engineering has great potential to provide alternative approaches for tissue regeneration, several problems have hampered progress in translating technological advances to clinical reality. Specifically, engineering of skin substitutes requires long culture times and delayed vascularization after implantation compromises graft survival. To address these issues we developed a novel two-prong strategy for tissue regeneration in vivo: (1) vascularization of acellular dermal scaffolds by infiltration of angiogenic factors; and (2) generation of stratified epidermis by in situ delivery of epidermal keratinocytes onto the prevascularized dermal support. Using athymic mouse as a model system, we found that incorporation of angiogenic factors within acellular human dermis enhanced the density and diameter of infiltrating host blood vessels. Increased vascularization correlated with enhanced proliferation and stratification of the neoepidermis originating from the fibrin-keratinocyte cell suspension. This strategy promoted tissue regeneration in vivo with no need for engineering skin substitutes; therefore, it may be useful for treatment of major wounds when skin donor sites are scarce and rapid wound coverage is required.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Genome-wide expression microarray studies were performed, and vascular density was quantified after CD34 immunohistochemistry.\nA first germline variant was identified in the SDHB gene (c.158G>A; p.Gly53Glu). However, a positive SDHB immunostaining in the tumor indicated that this SDHB variant was a non-functional polymorphism. A novel TMEM127 germline mutation (c.140C>A, p.Ala47Asp) associated with a 2q11 LOH was found. Transcriptome and immunohistochemical analyses showed that TMEM127-related pheochromocytoma clusterized with NF1-related and RET-related tumors in a large series of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, exhibited a reduced TMEM127 mRNA expression and displayed a low vascularization. The phosphorylation of S6K observed in this tumor was suggestive of an activation of the MTOR pathway.\nPathological and genomic data demonstrated that a TMEM127 gene mutation not previously described was causative of a new case of familial bilateral pheochromocytoma.

Here, we suggest that the abundant vasculature present in the human placenta can serve as a source of myogenic cells to regenerate skeletal muscle. Chorionic villi dissected from the mid-gestation human placenta were first transplanted intact into the gastrocnemius muscles of SCID/mdx mice, where they participated in muscle regeneration by producing myofibers expressing human dystrophin and spectrin. In vitro-cultured placental villi released rapidly adhering and migratory CD146+CD34\u207bCD45\u207bCD56\u207b cells of putative perivascular origin that expressed mesenchymal stem cell markers. CD146+CD34\u207bCD45\u207bCD56\u207b perivascular cells isolated and purified from the placental villi by flow cytometry were indeed highly myogenic in culture, and generated dystrophin-positive myofibers, and they promoted angiogenesis after transplantation into SCID/mdx mouse muscles.

In this study, pullulan-collagen composite hydrogel matrices were fabricated using a salt-induced phase inversion technique, resulting in a structured yet soft scaffold for skin engineering. Salt crystallization induced interconnected pore formation, and modification of collagen concentration permitted regulation of scaffold pore size. Hydrogel architecture recapitulated the reticular distribution of human dermal matrix while maintaining flexible properties essential for skin applications. In vitro, collagen hydrogel scaffolds retained their open porous architecture and viably sustained human fibroblasts and murine mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. In vivo, hydrogel-treated murine excisional wounds demonstrated improved wound closure, which was associated with increased recruitment of stromal cells and formation of vascularized granulation tissue. In conclusion, salt-induced phase inversion techniques can be used to create modifiable pullulan-collagen composite dermal scaffolds that augment early wound healing.

Matrix metallopeptidases (MMP) contribute to spatial and temporal matrix remodeling in the bovine endometrium. In this study we observed distinct changes in expression of MMP2, MMP14, and the metallopeptidase inhibitor TIMP2 between different phases of the estrous cycle indicating an endocrine regulation. An increase of TIMP2 protein abundance was ascertained in the uterine lumen during the time of embryo elongation. The expression pattern and cellular localization correlate well with the assumed effects of MMPs on release and activation of cytokines and growth factors directing cell migration, differentiation, and vascularization during this pivotal period of development. Specifically, active MMP2 in the endometrium may determine the allocation of growth factors supporting conceptus development. The presence of a day 18 conceptus in vivo and day 8 blastoysts in vitro induced endometrial TIMP2 mRNA expression. The results imply that TIMP2 is involved in very early local maternal recognition of pregnancy.

Despite the widespread investigation of polysaccharide-based hydrogel scaffolds for their therapeutic applications, blood vessel ingrowth into these hydrogel scaffolds remains a challenge. We hypothesized that modifying the properties of biodegradable hydrogel scaffolds with immobilization of multiple angiogenic growth factors (GFs) would induce a rapid proliferation of functional vasculature into the scaffolds. To this end, we remodeled the hydrogel structure by decreasing crosslinking density via reduced degree of substitution of crosslinking groups, which resulted in improved hydrogel properties including reduced rigidity, increased swelling, increased vascular endothelial GF (VEGF) release capability, and facilitated rapid hydrogel disintegration and tissue ingrowth. Immobilizing VEGF in the scaffolds promoted tissue ingrowth and expedited biodegradation. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of multiple angiogenic GFs was established; the coimmobilization of VEGF+ angiopoietin-1, and VEGF+ insulin-like GF+ stromal cell-derived factor-1 induced more and larger blood vessels than any individual GF, while the combination of all GFs dramatically increased the size and number of newly formed functional vessels. Altogether, our data demonstrate that rapid, efficient, and functional neovascularization can be achieved by precisely manipulating hydrogel scaffold properties and immobilizing defined angiogenic GFs.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2010-09-28", "authors": ["GuomingSun", "Yu-IShen", "SravantiKusuma", "KarenFox-Talbot", "Charles JSteenbergen", "SharonGerecht"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.091"}

Here, we investigated the biosynthesis and bioactions of the pro-resolving mediators lipoxin A(4) and resolvin E1 in host responses to organ transplantation. In samples obtained during screening bronchoscopy after human lung transplantation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of lipoxin A(4) were increased in association with the severity of allograft rejection that was graded independently by clinical pathology. Lipoxin A(4) significantly inhibited calcineurin activation in human neutrophils, and lipoxin A(4) stable analogs prevented acute rejection of vascularized cardiac and renal allografts. Transgenic animals expressing human lipoxin A(4) receptors revealed important sites of action in host tissues for lipoxin A(4)'s protective effects. Resolvin E1 displays counter-regulatory actions for leukocytes, in part, via increased lipoxin A(4) biosynthesis, yet RvE1 administered (1\u03bcg, iv) to donor (days -1 and 0) and recipient mice (days -1, 0 and +4) was even more potent than a lipoxin stable analog (1\u03bcg, iv) in prolonging renal allograft survival (median survival time=74.0 days with RvE1 and 37.5 days with a LXA(4) analog).

{"title": "Simulation study of brain blood flow regulation by intra-cortical arterioles in an anatomically accurate large human vascular network: Part I: methodology and baseline flow.", "abstract": "Hemodynamically based functional neuroimaging techniques, such as BOLD fMRI and PET, provide indirect measures of neuronal activity. The quantitative relationship between neuronal activity and the measured signals is not yet precisely known, with uncertainties remaining about the relative contribution by their metabolic and hemodynamic components. Empirical observations have demonstrated the importance of the latter component and suggested that micro-vascular anatomy has a potential influence. The recent development of a 3D computer-assisted method for micro-vascular cerebral network analysis has produced a large quantitative library on the microcirculation of the human cerebral cortex (Cassot et al., 2006), which can be used to investigate the hemodynamic component of brain activation through fluid dynamic modeling. For this purpose, we perform the first simulations of blood flow in an anatomically accurate large human intra-cortical vascular network (~10000 segments), using a 1D non-linear model taking account of the complex rheological properties of blood flow in microcirculation. This model predicts blood pressure, blood flow and hematocrit distributions, as well as volumes of functional vascular territories, and regional flow at voxel and network scales. First, the influence of the prescribed boundary conditions (BCs) on the baseline flow structure is investigated, highlighting relevant lower- and upper-bound BCs. Independent of these BCs, large heterogeneities of baseline flow from vessel to vessel and from voxel to voxel, are demonstrated. These heterogeneities are controlled by the architecture of the intra-cortical vascular network. In particular, a correlation between the blood flow and the proportion of vascular volume occupied by arterioles or venules, at voxel scale, is highlighted. Then, the extent of venous contamination downstream to the sites of neuronal activation is investigated, demonstrating a linear relationship between the catchment surface of the activated area and the diameter of the intra-cortical draining vein.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2010-09-28", "authors": ["SLorthois", "FCassot", "FLauwers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.032"}
{"title": "The normal menstrual cycle in women.", "abstract": "The menstrual cycle in women is characterised by high variability in cycle length (26-35 days), 5-day menses, a fertile phase from 5 days before to the day of ovulation, and low fertility which is dependent on cycle length and age. All women show an FSH rise at the luteal-follicular transition, stimulating a cohort of follicular growth and inhibin B secretion in the early follicular phase. The ovulatory dominant follicle (DF) is selected in the mid-follicular phase, and as this DF grows it increasingly secretes oestradiol and inhibin A for a week before ovulation. Gonadotrophin responsiveness, IGF binding protein expression and degradation, and vascularisation have been identified to be crucial for DF selection and progression. Two-thirds of women show two follicle waves and 1/3 show 3 follicle waves per cycle. Three-wave women have longer cycles, and a later oestradiol rise and LH surge. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, oestradiol and inhibin A in response to LH pulses, and reaches its peak in terms of size, secretions, and vascularization 6-7 days after ovulation. Luteal regression is passive and independent of the uterus, but can be prevented by hCG, the luteotrophic signal from the trophoblast, from 8 days after conception. Reductions in systemic steroid and protein hormone concentrations may be responsible for the FSH rise characteristic of premenopausal women. The functional layer of the endometrium shows steroid hormone-dependent proliferation, differentiation, and shedding in the absence of the trophoblast. Menstruation is initiated by progesterone responsive decidual cells, and executed by PGE and PGF2\u03b1, vasoconstriction and matrix metalloprotease secretion by leukocytes.

Using individual vessel components, we characterized intra-scaffold microvessel self-assembly efficiency in a physiological in vivo tissue engineering implant context. Primary human microvascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells were seeded at different ratios in poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffolds enriched with basement membrane proteins (Matrigel) and implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice. Temporal intra-scaffold microvessel formation, anastomosis and perfusion were monitored by immunohistochemical, flow cytometric and in vivo multiphoton fluorescence microscopy analysis. Vascularization in the tissue-engineering context was strongly enhanced in implants seeded with a complete complement of blood vessel components: human microvascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo assembled a patent microvasculature within Matrigel-enriched PLLA scaffolds that anastomosed with the host circulation during the first week of implantation. Multiphoton fluorescence angiographic analysis of the intra-scaffold microcirculation showed a uniform, branched microvascular network. 3D image reconstruction analysis of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (hPASMC) distribution within vascularized implants was non-random and displayed a preferential perivascular localization.

Neuroimaging studies demonstrated a 4-cm cystic lesion in posterior fossa containing a 1-cm contrast-enhancing nodule on its lateral margin. The lesion was confined to the fourth ventricle and initially thought to be a hemangioblastoma until angiography clarified the minimal tumor vascularization. Gross total resection was achieved. Pathological examination showed a rosette-forming low grade tumor with a cell proliferation rate of 2% being consistent with RGNT. The postoperative course was uneventful and clinical symptoms resolved completely. There was no tumor recurrence after 2 years follow-up. We confirm that the rare and only recently characterized tumor entity of RGNT can also be found in elderly patients; furthermore, it can be associated with a benign course. The main differential diagnosis of RGNT resulting from CNS-imaging modalities in elderly patients are pilocytic astrocytoma and hemangioblastoma of the posterior fossa, which after metastasis are the most common primary adult intra-axial posterior fossa tumors.

Although many algorithms have been reported in literature for this problem, those that are applicable to various density types have not been available until recently. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that is applicable to solid, non-solid and part-solid types and solitary, vascularized, and juxtapleural types. First, the algorithm separates lung parenchyma and radiographically denser anatomical structures with coupled competition and diffusion processes. The technique tends to derive a spatially more homogeneous foreground map than an adaptive thresholding based method. Second, it locates the core of a nodule in a manner that is applicable to juxtapleural types using a transformation applied on the Euclidean distance transform of the foreground. Third, it detaches the nodule from attached structures by a region growing on the Euclidean distance map followed by a procedure to delineate the surface of the nodule based on the patterns of the region growing and distance maps. Finally, convex hull of the nodule surface intersected with the foreground constitutes the final segmentation. The performance of the technique is evaluated with two Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) data sets with 23 and 82 nodules each, and another data set with 820 nodules with manual diameter measurements.

Gold beads were percutaneously implanted via a needle into different locations surrounding the greater trochanter of the femur. Nine dogs with implants were necropsied. In all examined animals, characteristic histologic lesions were observed in the tissue surrounding the gold implants--namely, a fibrous capsule composed of concentric fibroblasts intermixed with a variable number of inflammatory cells and a paucicellular innermost layer of collagen with a few fibrocyte-like cells in empty lacunae. Lymphocytes dominated the inflammatory infiltrate, with rarely observed macrophages present in close proximity to the implant site. No giant cells were observed. Immunohistochemistry showed mixed populations of lymphocytes, both CD3 positive (T cells) and CD79a positive (B cells), which in some cases formed lymphoid follicles. Diffuse inflammatory changes were present to a minor extent in the perimysium and surrounding fascia. The inflammation observed in dogs is similar to that observed with gold implants in humans. It is possible that the clinically beneficial effect of gold beads for chronic osteoarthritis depends on sustained localized inflammation with localized release of soluble mediators. The encapsulation of the implant by a paucicellular and poorly vascularized fibrous capsule may help prevent an exaggerated inflammatory reaction by sequestering the gold bead from the surrounding tissue.", "journal": "Veterinary pathology", "date": "2010-09-24", "authors": ["K-ILie", "GJ\u00e6ger", "KNordstoga", "LMoe"], "doi": "10.1177/0300985810381910"}
{"title": "pH control mechanisms of tumor survival and growth.", "abstract": "A distinguishing phenotype of solid tumors is the presence of an alkaline cellular feature despite the surrounding acidic microenvironment. This phenotypic characteristic of tumors, originally described by Otto Warburg, arises due to alterations in metabolism of solid tumors. Hypoxic regions of solid tumors develop due to poor vascularization and in turn regulate the expression of numerous genes via the transcription factor HIF-1. Ultimately, the tumor microenvironment directs the development of tumor cells adapted to survive in an acidic surrounding where normal cells perish. The provision of unique pH characteristics in tumor cells provides a defining trait that has led to the pursuit of treatments that target metabolism, hypoxia, and pH-related mechanisms to selectively kill cancer cells. Numerous studies over the past decade involving the cancer-specific carbonic anhydrase IX have re-kindled an interest in pH disruption-based therapies. Although an acidification of the intracellular compartment is established as a means to induce normal cell death, the defining role of acid-base disturbances in tumor physiology and survival remains unclear. The aim of this review is to summarize recent data relating to the specific role of pH regulation in tumor cell survival.

{"title": "Efficient nonadhesive ex vivo expansion of early endothelial progenitor cells derived from CD34+ human cord blood fraction for effective therapeutic vascularization.", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been shown to have therapeutic potential in ischemic disease. However, the number of EPCs for cell therapy is limited. In this study, instead of the typical adherent culture method, we investigated a more efficient, clinically applicable nonadhesive expansion method for early EPCs using cord blood-derived cells to overcome rapid cellular senescence. After a suspension culture of isolated CD34(+) cells in serum-free medium containing each cytokine combination was maintained for 9 d, the number of expanded functional EPCs was assessed by an adherent culture assay. Compared to mononuclear cells, the CD34(+) fraction was superior in its expansion of functional EPCs that could differentiate into acLDL/UEA-1(+) cells without significant cellular senescence, whereas the CD34(-) fraction showed no EPC expansion. Among the cytokine combinations tested for the CD34(+) fraction, a combination (SFIb) consisting of stem cell factor (SCF), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, interleukin-3, and basic fibroblast growth factor resulted in a reproducible 64- to 1468-fold EPC expansion from various cord blood origins. Interestingly, the SFIb combination displayed markedly increased EPC expansion (2.43-fold), with a higher percentage of CD34(+) cells (2.17-fold), undifferentiated blasts (2.38-fold) and CXCR4(+) cells (1.68-fold) compared to another cytokine combination (SCF, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), although the two cytokine combinations had a similar level of total mononucleated cell expansion (\u223c 10% difference). Accordingly, the cells expanded in the SFIb combination were more effective in recovery of blood flow and neovascularization in hind-limb ischemia in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the nonadhesive serum-free culture conditions of the CD34(+) fraction provide an effective EPC expansion method for cell therapy, and an expansion condition leading to high percentages of CD34(+) cells and blasts is likely important in EPC expansion.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2010-09-21", "authors": ["EunjuO", "Byung HunLee", "Hyun-YoungAhn", "Jong-ChulShin", "Hyun-KyungKim", "MyungshinKim", "In-YangPark", "Yong-GyuPark", "Young AeJoe"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.10-162040"}
{"title": "Principles of high-frequency ultrasonography for investigation of skin pathology.", "abstract": "Ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool widely used in medicine. During the last three decades, this non-invasive skin imaging method has been extended to dermatology. High-frequency ultrasonography with higher than 20MHz scanners is well-established for measuring tumour thickness and skin thickness when treating inflammatory skin diseases such as scleroderma or psoriasis. High-frequency ultrasonography has become extremely helpful for the preoperative assessment of skin melanoma. The correlation between ultrasonic and histological measurements of melanomas thickness is significantly similarly good using transducers of 20, 75 or 100MHz frequency (r range from 0.895 to 0.99) and better compared with transducers of 7.5MHz frequency (r=0.76). The preoperative sonographically estimated thickness of skin melanoma is sometimes overestimated, because of an underlying inflammatory infiltrate and other reasons. Assessment of skin melanoma thickness using transducers of 100MHz frequency has better agreement with histology, compared with ultrasonography with 20MHz transducers. However, the ultrasonic penetration depth is limited to 1.5mm in case of 100MHz. The newer ultrasonic techniques such as high-frequency ultrasonography and colour Doppler sonography could be used for assessment of the tumour vascularization and its metastatic potential. The wide variety of diagnostic information provided by high-frequency ultrasonography undoubtedly improves the management of oncological and inflammatory skin conditions and underlines its essential position in dermatological practice.", "journal": "Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV", "date": "2010-09-21", "authors": ["DJasaitiene", "SValiukeviciene", "GLinkeviciute", "RRaisutis", "EJasiuniene", "RKazys"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1468-3083.2010.03837.x"}

In this study, we examined the effect of chronic hypoxia on the canal network in postnatal bone. Tibiae were harvested from 4- and 8-week-old rats (hyp-4 and -8, n = 8 each), whose growth was retarded owing to postnatal exposure to hypoxia (12-14% O\u2082), and from 3- and 4-week-old normoxic rats (cnt-4 and -5, n = 8 each), which were similar in tibial length and cortical cross-sectional area to hyp-4 and -8, respectively. The diaphyseal canals were detected by monochromatic synchrotron radiation CT with a 3.1-\u03bcm voxel resolution. The anatomical properties of the canal network were compared between age- or size-matched hypoxic and normoxic groups. The canals were larger in diameter, were more densely distributed and connected, and opened into the marrow cavity with a higher density in hyp-4 than in cnt-4. The canal density and connectivity were also higher in hyp-4 than in cnt-3. The canal diameter, density, and connectivity were smaller in hyp-8 than in cnt-4; however, the densities of endocortical and periosteal canal openings did not differ between hyp-8 and cnt-4.

{"title": "In vivo evaluation of implant-host tissue interaction using morphology-controlled hydroxyapatite-based biomaterials.", "abstract": "In medicine, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) perform several specific functions. The design of bio-packages for MEMS to be implanted into the human body has been an increasing challenge in the last years. Mechanical, chemical and thermal resistance, as well as excellent bonding to silicon surfaces, are needed. Furthermore, ideal bio-packages should minimize post-operative complications and be well accepted by the host. To reach this goal, two different morphology-controlled hydroxyapatite-based porous biomaterials were synthesized, implanted in rats and evaluated mechanically and histologically. The novel biomaterials were prepared at room temperature using synthetic hydroxyapatite micro-particles, silica nanoparticles and water-based resin and compared with a standard hydroxyapatite biomaterial. The morphology (porosity) was controlled to obtain interconnected pores with appropriated pore size and pore volume fraction. All biomaterials were implanted in rats at the dorsal area near the third thoracic vertebra. The rats were killed 2, 7 and 21 days after surgery. Histological analysis revealed that the implants were well accepted by the host and minimal local inflammation was observed. The acute inflammatory response disappeared 21 days after surgery for both novel biomaterials. Additionally, organic matter (collagen) was produced in the interior of the porous biomaterial, indicating that an incipient vascularization process was in progress after 21 days of implantation.

With high spatial resolution and contrast of biological soft tissues, DEI is a non-invasive synchrotron-based imaging technique and does not require contrast agents. Particularly, this article highlights the exploration of the objects inside microvessels. A segment of blood vessel, which is obstructed by a blood clot, is under quantitative assessment and the result provides a precise description of vessel stenosis.

A rapid placental vascularization observed in the second half of pig pregnancy is positively correlated with the mRNA expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that VEGF may have a stimulatory effect in the dynamically growing UC. To further understand the role of the VEGF-VEGFR system during UC development, mRNA and protein expression as well as the cellular localization of VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 in UC were examined on days 40, 60, 75 and 90 of pregnancy and after physiological delivery in the pig (day 114 of pregnancy). Real Time RT-PCR analysis showed an increase in the mRNA levels of VEGF120 and VEGF164 from day 90 of pregnancy. VEGFR-1 mRNA expression was significantly increased on day 75 of pregnancy. No significant changes in VEGFR-2 mRNA expression were detected. In turn, western blot analysis revealed an increase in VEGF-A protein expression on day 40, compared to the later days of pregnancy. A rapid increase in the VEGFR-1 protein level was noted on day 75 and 90 of gestation. No significant changes in VEGFR-2 protein expression were detected on any of the analysed days of pregnancy. Immunohistochemical staining enabled detection of VEGF-VEGFR system, in endothelial and tunica media cells of the umbilical vessels and in allantoic duct and amniotic epithelium on all analysed days of pregnancy. Positive reactions for VEGF-A and VEGFR-1, but not VEGFR-2, were also observed in myofibroblasts.

Transplanted islets were rapidly engrafted in intestinal segments as demonstrated vascularization and expression of insulin and glucagon throughout the 60-day duration of the studies. Transplantation of islets restored euglycemia in diabetic rats, which was similar to animals receiving islets intraportally. Moreover, animals treated with islet transplants showed normal responses to glucose challenges. Removal of graft-bearing intestinal segments led to recurrence of hyperglycemia indicating that transplanted islets were responsible for improved outcomes.

{"title": "Quantitating antibody uptake in vivo: conditional dependence on antigen expression levels.", "abstract": "Antibodies form an important class of cancer therapeutics, and there is intense interest in using them for imaging applications in diagnosis and monitoring of cancer treatment. Despite the expanding body of knowledge describing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of antibodies in vivo, discrepancies remain over the effect of antigen expression level on tumoral uptake with some reports indicating a relationship between uptake and expression and others showing no correlation.\nUsing a cell line with high epithelial cell adhesion molecule expression and moderate epidermal growth factor receptor expression, fluorescent antibodies with similar plasma clearance were imaged in vivo. A mathematical model and mouse xenograft experiments were used to describe the effect of antigen expression on uptake of these high-affinity antibodies.\nAs predicted by the theoretical model, under subsaturating conditions, uptake of the antibodies in such tumors is similar because localization of both probes is limited by delivery from the vasculature. In a separate experiment, when the tumor is saturated, the uptake becomes dependent on the number of available binding sites. In addition, targeting of small micrometastases is shown to be higher than larger vascularized tumors.\nThese results are consistent with the prediction that high affinity antibody uptake is dependent on antigen expression levels for saturating doses and delivery for subsaturating doses. It is imperative for any probe to understand whether quantitative uptake is a measure of biomarker expression or transport to the region of interest.

VEGF content was determined with ELISA. \u03b2-ARs, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, occludin, and albumin were measured with Western blot. Retinal localization of \u03b23-ARs was determined by immunohistochemistry. Retinopathy was assessed by scoring fluorescein-perfused retinas, and plasma extravasation was visualized by Evans blue dye.\nHypoxia did not influence \u03b2-AR expression, except that it increased \u03b23-AR protein with dense \u03b23-AR immunoreactivity localized to engorged retinal tufts. Hypoxia upregulated VEGF, IGF-1, their receptors, and HIF-1\u03b1. Propranolol dose-dependently reduced upregulated VEGF and decreased hypoxic levels of IGF-1 mRNA and HIF-1\u03b1. Blockade of IGF-1R activity with PPP did not influence propranolol's effects on VEGF. Retinal VEGF in normoxic mice or VEGF in brain, lungs, and heart of the OIR mice were unaffected by propranolol. Propranolol ameliorated the retinopathy score, restored occludin and albumin, and reduced hypoxia-induced plasma extravasation without influencing the vascular permeability induced by intravitreal VEGF.\nThis is the first demonstration that \u03b2-AR blockade is protective against retinal angiogenesis and ameliorates BRB dysfunction in OIR. Although the relevance of these results to infant ROP is uncertain, the findings may help to establish potential pharmacologic targets based on \u03b23-AR pharmacology.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2010-08-27", "authors": ["ChiaraRistori", "LucaFilippi", "MassimoDal Monte", "DavideMartini", "MaurizioCammalleri", "PinaFortunato", "Giancarlola Marca", "PatrizioFiorini", "PaolaBagnoli"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.10-5536"}

The aim of our study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression and localization of VEGF and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms in cultured amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs) isolated from normal euploid pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by trisomy 21. In addition, we measured the VEGF and NO content in cell culture supernatants to analyse their production by AF-MSCs.\nAF-MSCs were obtained from women with foetal DS and controls matched for age and gestation, and expanded in culture. The cells were then evaluated for the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF and NOS isoforms, as well as for the release of VEGF and NO.\nOur analyses showed that both the VEGF expression and production were significantly lower in DS-AF-MSCs with respect to the controls. As regards NOS, immunohistochemical expression of eNOS was significantly reduced in DS-AF-MSCs, whereas the nNOS and iNOS were similarly immunoexpressed in both groups of cells. Moreover, we observed that the NO content was significantly higher in medium derived by DS-AF-MSCs.\nOur study shows, for the first time, the differences between AF-MSCs isolated from control and trisomy 21 pregnancies and suggest an involvement of NO and VEGF in the physiopathological mechanisms associated with DS pregnancy.", "journal": "European journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2010-08-25", "authors": ["EleonoraSalvolini", "MoniaOrciani", "GuendalinaLucarini", "AriannaVignini", "Andrea LuigiTranquilli", "RobertoDi Primio"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02370.x"}

However, the technique, as first described, cannot be applied in gigantomastia or severe breast ptosis cases or cases of dense parenchyma of the breast. The senior surgeon suggested an intraoperative modification of the Pitanguy method of reduction mammaplasty to make it applicable for such cases.\nA retrospective study of 122 patients with severe breast ptosis (70), gigantomastia (45), or dense breast parenchyma (7) who underwent a modification of the Pitanguy method was performed. The current procedure involves all the operating steps of the superior pedicle technique as described by Pitanguy, from the marking technique to the keel resection of the breast. If the nipple-areola complex is elevated inadequately, the surgeon can use the senior surgeon's modification to elevate the complex to the desired height. This modification consists of dissecting the upper pole of the breast vertically to the fascia of the pectoralis major muscle and laterally to the nipple-areola complex. The medial flap is then advanced superiorly, rotated 90\u00b0, and sutured to point A, while the lateral flap is placed below the medial one. This maneuver maximizes elevation of the nipple-areola complex to the desired height.\nThe mean change in nipple position was 14\u00a0cm (range\u00a0=\u00a010-16\u00a0cm). The mean weight reduction of each breast was 900\u00a0g (range\u00a0=\u00a0700-1300\u00a0g).

Three patients were operated on less than 3\u00a0months ago and were not involved in this study. All patients gained natural shaped breasts and they were pleased with the results. Serious complications, including flap necrosis, were avoided since caution was used to preserve the internal mammary perforators while performing this method.\nThis technique provides a versatile, well-vascularized pedicle that allows elevation of the nipple-areola complex at the desired height in cases of severe breast ptosis, gigantomastia, or dense breast parenchyma.", "journal": "Aesthetic plastic surgery", "date": "2010-08-21", "authors": ["AndreasFoustanos", "KonstantinosPanagiotopoulos", "GeorgeSkouras"], "doi": "10.1007/s00266-010-9556-0"}

Forty 12-week-old male New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into group I (left untreated, n=12), group II (core decompression, n=12), and group III (core decompression + autologous EPCs implantation, n=16) after receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON. Four weeks later, these rabbits were euthanized, bilateral femora were dissected for Micro-CT-based microangiography to assess vascularization, and then the osteonecrotic changes and repair processes were examined histopathologically. Quantitative analysis showed that new vessel formation in group III was significantly greater compared with other groups at 4 weeks after treatment. The histologic and histomorphometric analyses revealed that the new bone volume was significantly higher in group III than in groups I and II 4 weeks after treatment.

Immunohistochemistry was used to detect MTA1 on tissue microarrays (TMA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD31, and Ki67 in xenografts. We used retroviral or lentiviral RNAi transduction of PCa cells to establish MTA1 knockdowns.

The role of MTA1 in PCa tumorigenesis was evaluated in mouse xenografts.\nWe identified MTA1 as a component of bone metastasis signature in PCa, which suggested a possible role for MTA1 in PCa progression and metastasis. MTA1 was expressed at higher levels in PCa cell lines than in normal prostate epithelial cells. Silencing MTA1 significantly suppressed the invasion and angiogenic activity of the cells in vitro and delayed tumor formation and development in mouse xenografts. Tumors that express MTA1 had higher proliferative indices, secreted higher levels of VEGF and were more vascularized. Analysis of the human TMA showed positive correlation between MTA1 nuclear localization/staining intensity and PCa aggressiveness.\nMTA1 pro-angiogenic and pro-invasive functions create permissive environment for PCa tumor growth and likely support metastasis.

{"title": "Defining conditions for covalent immobilization of angiogenic growth factors onto scaffolds for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Rapid vascularization of engineered tissues in vitro and in vivo remains one of the key limitations in tissue engineering. We propose that angiogenic growth factors covalently immobilized on scaffolds for tissue engineering can be used to accomplish this goal. The main objectives of this work were: (a) to derive desirable experimental conditions for the covalent immobilization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) on porous collagen scaffolds; and (b) to determine whether primary endothelial cells respond to these scaffolds with covalently immobilized angiogenic factors. VEGF and Ang1 were covalently immobilized onto porous collagen scaffolds, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) chemistry. To improve covalent immobilization conditions: (a) different reaction buffers [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), distilled water, or 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulphonic acid (MES)] were used; and (b) step immobilization was compared to bulk immobilization. In step immobilization, growth factors are applied after EDC activation of the scaffold, while in bulk immobilization, reagents are simultaneously applied to the scaffold. PBS as the reaction buffer resulted in higher amounts of VEGF and Ang1 immobilized (ELISA), higher cell proliferation rates (XTT) and increased lactate metabolism compared to water and MES as the reaction buffers. Step immobilization in PBS buffer was also more effective than bulk immobilization. Immobilized growth factors resulted in higher cell proliferation and lactate metabolism compared to soluble growth factors used at comparable concentrations.

{"title": "CD36-mediated activation of endothelial cell apoptosis by an N-terminal recombinant fragment of thrombospondin-2 inhibits breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo.", "abstract": "Thus far the clinical benefits seen in breast cancer patients treated with drugs targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway are only modest. Consequently, additional antiangiogenic approaches for treatment of breast cancer need to be investigated. Thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis with a greater potency than the related molecule TSP-1. The systemic effects of TSP-2 on tumor metastasis and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-2 have remained poorly understood. We generated a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal region of TSP-2 and the IgG-Fc1 fragment (N-TSP2-Fc) and could demonstrate that the antiangiogenic activity of N-TSP2-Fc is dependent on the CD36 receptor. We found that N-TSP2-Fc inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) on matrigel in vitro and that concurrent incubation of anti-CD36 antibody with N-TSP2-Fc resulted in tube formation that was comparable to untreated control. N-TSP2-Fc potently induced apoptosis of HDMEC in vitro in a CD36-dependent manner. Moreover, we could demonstrate a CD36 receptor-mediated loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 in HDMEC in vitro. Daily intraperitoneal injections of N-TSP2-Fc resulted in a significant inhibition of the growth of human MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells grown in the mammary gland of immunodeficient nude mice and in reduced tumor vascularization. Finally, increased serum concentrations of N-TSP2-Fc significantly inhibited regional metastasis to lymph nodes and distant metastasis to lung as shown by quantitative real-time alu PCR. These results identify N-TSP2-Fc as a potent systemic inhibitor of tumor metastasis and provide strong evidence for an important role of the CD36 receptor in mediating the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-2.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2010-08-18", "authors": ["ManuelKoch", "FadiHussein", "AndreasWoeste", "CarstenGr\u00fcndker", "KarlFrontzek", "G\u00fcnterEmons", "ThomasHawighorst"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-010-1085-7\n10.1016/j.biocel.2004.01.004\n10.1016/S0039-6060(97)90043-X\n10.1054/bjoc.2000.1268\n10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282f0ad79\n10.1002/1097-0142(19950915)76:6<998::AID-CNCR2820760613>3.0.CO;2-0\n10.1038/nrc2442\n10.1038/35025220\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1528\n10.1083/jcb.138.3.707\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.021\n10.1038/nature04483\n10.1056/NEJM197108122850711\n10.1093/emboj/20.11.2631\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2396\n10.1007/s10549-009-0460-8\n10.1038/71517\n10.1007/s00018-007-7486-z\n10.1056/NEJMra0706596\n10.1083/jcb.151.2.221\n10.1083/jcb.140.2.419\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62512-6\n10.1016/S0955-0674(00)00143-5\n10.1172/JCI1684\n10.1056/NEJMoa072113\n10.1016/S1471-4914(03)00047-9\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0419\n10.1016/0022-1759(91)90198-O\n10.1097/00000478-199910000-00015\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12643.x\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19961215)78:12<2515::AID-CNCR11>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.027\n10.1007/s10549-006-9392-8\n10.1038/73432\n10.1023/A:1020992411420\n10.1074/jbc.270.13.7304\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-3299-2\n10.1038/84643\n10.1073/pnas.96.26.14888\n10.1083/jcb.122.2.497\n10.1002/jcb.240530109\n10.1006/bbrc.1995.2780\n10.1023/A:1018477516367\n10.1007/s10549-008-9992-6"}

But, when the reconstruction involves a dentate mandible, the fibula has the limit as it does not offer sufficient bone height to restore the alveolar arch up to the occlusal plane. Therefore, the deficiency in bone height makes implant placement impractical. We report a case of vertical distraction osteogenesis of a free vascularized fibula flap used to reconstruct a hemimandible after resection of an odontogenic myxoma, for optimization of the implant prosthetic rehabilitation. The distraction device was applied intraorally. After 10 days of latency period, distraction protocol was performed at a distraction rate of 0.5 mm per day. A consolidation period of 3 months followed. Afterwards the distraction device was removed and 3 osseointegrated dental implants were placed in the distracted area. As a result, the vertical discrepancy between the fibula and the native hemimandible was corrected. The amount of vertical height achieved after distraction was 17 milimeters. The increase of vertical bone height was stable and enabled placement of dental implants without any complications.

RT-PCR analysis revealed that human neovascular membranes issued from patients with AMD expressed high levels of Mmp13. The contribution of MMP13 in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) formation was explored by using a murine model of laser-induced CNV and applying it to wild-type mice (WT) and Mmp13-deficient mice (Mmp13 ( -/- ) mice). Angiogenic and inflammatory reactions were explored by immunohistochemistry. The implication of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells was determined by BM engraftment into irradiated mice and by injecting mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolated from WT BM. The deficiency of Mmp13 impaired CNV formation which was fully restored by WT BM engraftment and partially rescued by several injections of WT MSC.

While this approach is being explored for its utility in adipose and cardiac tissue engineering and in islet transplantation, the initial question in this study was to assess the fate of the endothelial cells (EC) after transplantation delivered on the surface of modules, without an embedded cell. Rat aortic EC-covered collagen gel modules were transplanted into the omental pouch of allogeneic (outbred) Sprague-Dawley rats with and without immunosuppressive drug treatment (atorvastatin and tacrolimus) for 3-60 days. There was a significant increase in vessel density at all time points in the drug treated rats as compared to untreated rats. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive donor rat aortic EC migrated from the surface of the modules and formed primitive vessels by day 7. In the untreated rats, the GFP-positive cells were not seen after day 7. In drug-treated rats, GFP-positive vessels matured over time, accumulated erythrocytes, were supported by host smooth muscle cells, and formed chimeric vessels that survived until day 60. This resulted in the formation of a densely vascularized, perfusable network by day 60.

Myocardial infarction was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and HF was allowed to develop for 4 weeks. Thereafter, wild type (L6-WT; n=16) or Bcl-2-expressing (L6-Bcl2; n=19) myoblast sheets were transplanted epicardially. Control rats (n=21) underwent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and re-thoracotomy. Five rats were sham-operated in both surgeries. Four weeks after transplantation, only the L6-Bcl2 rats showed improved left ventricular ejection fraction. Their vascular density in the damaged myocardium was greater, and they had more proliferating cells. The L6-Bcl2 group had an increased amount of myocytes in the infarct area. Soluble factors from L6-Bcl2 sheets induced a 2.9-fold increase in endothelial cell proliferation, and enhanced endothelial wound healing as compared to the L6-WT sheets. These effects were inhibited by SU5416 and were thus dependent on Flt1/Flk1 signaling.

{"title": "Effectiveness factor and diffusion limitations in collagen gel modules containing HepG2 cells.", "abstract": "A major obstacle in tissue engineering is overcoming hypoxia in thick, three-dimensional (3D) engineered tissues, which is caused by the diffusional limitations of oxygen and lack of internal vasculature to facilitate mass transfer. Modular tissue engineering is a bio-mimetic strategy that forms scalable, vascularized and uniform 3D constructs by assembling small (sub-mm), cell-containing modules. It was previously assumed that mass transfer resistance within the individual modules was negligible, due to their small size. In the present study, this assumption was tested using theoretical analysis of oxygen transport within the module (effectiveness factor) and experimental studies. Small (400 \u00b5m diameter post-contraction) and large (700 \u00b5m diameter post-contraction) HepG2-collagen modules were made for a range of seeding densities (2 \u00d7 10(6) -1 \u00d7 10(7) cells/ml collagen). Cell density, distribution and morphology within the modules showed that the small modules were capable of sustaining high cell densities (8.0 \u00d7 10(7) \u00b1 4.4 \u00d7 10(7) cells/cm(3) ) with negligible mass transfer inhibition. Conversely, large modules developed a necrotic core and had significantly (p < 0.05) reduced cell densities (1.5 \u00d7 10(7) \u00b1 9.2 \u00d7 10(6) cells/cm(3) ). It was also observed that the embedded cells responded quickly to the oxygen availability, by proliferating or dying, to reach a sustainable density of approximately 8000 cells/module. Furthermore, a simple effectiveness factor calculation was successful in estimating the maximum cell density per module.

PCB153 is one of the most commonly found polychlorinated biphenyls, and based on epidemiological studies, has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. The endocrine disruptor PCB153 has been reported to bind the estrogen receptor alpha, induce vessel formation, and increase the formation of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells. Since PCB153-induced phenotypic changes are similar to estradiol, we postulated that PCB153 activates redox signaling pathways common to 17\u03b2-estradiol. Whether the effect of PCB153 on the proteome is comparable to 17\u03b2-estradiol is not known. Therefore we investigated the proteome of human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to PCB153 (100\u00a0ng/ml) for 24\u00a0h. Using 2D DIGE coupled to MALDI-time of flight (TOF)/TOF MS, we found 96 protein spots significantly (greater than 1.5-fold) modulated by experimental treatments. Mass spectrometry identified 11 of 13 protein spots with high confidence protein score CI that was greater than 95%. Of the identified proteins, lamin A/C and far upstream element-binding protein (FUBP1) were regulated similarly by both treatments. FUBP1 is of particular interest because it controls c-myc. While lamin A/C modulates transcription factor AP-1 function. Interestingly, both c-myc and AP-1 are redox-sensitive transcription factors known to regulate genes required for cell growth. Network analysis of these proteins showed transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 and c-myc to play central roles.

However, epiphora (excessive tear secretion) may occur after the successful transfer of whole submandibular gland because tear secretion level is closely related to the size of the transferred gland. The aim of this study was to investigate the microanatomy of SMG to explore the possibility of partial SMG transfer to prevent postoperative epiphora.\nSixty intact and histologically normal human SMGs from patients with benign tumor of the mandible who underwent vascularized mandibular reconstruction and removal of the SMG for anastomosis of the blood vessels were included in the study. SMGs were perfused with methacrylate to form resin casts of blood vessels and ducts. The length and diameter of the blood vessels and ducts in the casts were measured using a sliding caliper. The numbers of lobules, distribution of arteries, veins, and ducts, as well as the relationship among them, were analyzed.\nThe resin cast of the gland showed a treelike structure, with the vessels gradually dividing into multiple branches. The arteries, veins, and ducts run in parallel and were roughly divided into 3 levels: from the stem extending into the main branches (level I), into the narrower secondary branches (level II), and then the secondary branches subsequently divided into terminal branches (level III). The structures of the blood vessels and ducts were similar at each level in the lobules. In the vein casts, communicating vessels were found between the anterior facial vein and the concomitant vein of the facial artery.\nThe characteristic treelike structure of the SMG vascular and ductal system may provide useful information for partial gland transfers.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["HengXu", "ChiMao", "Jing-MingLiu", "XinPeng", "Zheng-HongZhu", "Guang-YanYu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2010.03.006"}

Calcium nodules were homogeneously formed on the surface of scaffolds cultured with MSC. A Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis demonstrated the formation of hydroxyapatite spectroscopically. Among all G/COS scaffolds, the highest ALP activity and calcium content were observed for MSC cultured in the G/COS 70:30 scaffolds. The G/COS 70:30 scaffolds were then pre-cultured with MSC in the osteogenic medium for 28 days and subcutaneously implanted into nude mice to evaluate ectopic bone formation. Enhanced vascularization, cell infiltration, collagen formation and calcium deposition around the scaffolds implanted were histologically observed at 2 and 8 weeks after implantation.

We studied the capacity of a nontoxic concentration of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), a thymidine synthesis inhibitor, to increase uptake of [(18)F]FLT in tumor xenografts.\nThe duration of the FdUrd effect in vivo on tumor cell cycling and thymidine analogue uptake was studied by varying FdUrd pretreatment timing and holding constant the timing of subsequent flow cytometry and 5-[(125)I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine biodistribution measurements. In [(18)F]FLT studies, FdUrd pretreatment was generally performed 1 h before radiotracer injection. [(18)F]FLT biodistributions were measured 1 to 3 h after radiotracer injection of mice grafted with five different human tumors and pretreated or not with FdUrd and compared with [(18)F]FDG tumor uptake. Using microPET, the dynamic distribution of [(18)F]FLT was followed for 1.5 h in FdUrd pretreated mice. High-field T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology were used comparatively in assessing tumor viability and proliferation.\nFdUrd induced an immediate increase in tumor uptake of 5-[(125)I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, that vanished after 6 h, as also confirmed by flow cytometry. Biodistribution measurements showed that FdUrd pretreatment increased [(18)F]FLT uptake in all tumors by factors of 3.2 to 7.8 compared with controls, while [(18)F]FDG tumor uptake was about fourfold and sixfold lower in breast cancers and lymphoma. Dynamic PET in FdUrd pretreated mice showed that [(18)F]FLT uptake in all tumors increased steadily up to 1.5 h.

We report our histopathologic findings of such blebs developing around the Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) after a short time period in young patients.\nNine young patients (2 to 17 y of age) with otherwise uncontrollable glaucoma were treated with AGV (models FP-7 and FP-8, silicone base plate) by 1 surgeon (H.T.). Four eyes needed surgical revision 2 to 6 months after initial implantation owing to encapsulated bleb development over the valve with total loss of function. The dense capsule around the device was surgically removed and investigated macroscopically, microscopically, and ultrastructurally.\nThe cystic wall of these encapsulated blebs had an overall thickness of 1.5 to 2 mm. Macroscopically, the tissue was split into 2 layers. Histopathologically, the smooth inner surface (facing the base plate of the AGV) consisted of compressed collagen fibers with signs of elastoid degeneration and with formation of a pseudoendothelium toward the base plate. There was a pronounced transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in this inner layer. The outer area was highly vascularized. In these vessels electron microscopy revealed thrombosis. Inflammatory responses were nearly absent in all areas of the excised material. Intraocular pressure could be controlled by removal of the encapsulated blebs in all 4 cases.\nEncapsulation of the AGV is an early complication in young patients, leading to inhibition of fluid exchange and failure of the procedure. The valve mechanism is blocked by contracted scar tissue, but the device itself is not affected by the encapsulation. Surgical excision of the capsule immediately leads to an aqueous flow and drop of intraocular pressure.", "journal": "Journal of glaucoma", "date": "2010-06-04", "authors": ["HagenThieme", "LarsChoritz", "CarmenHofmann-Rummelt", "UrsulaSchloetzer-Schrehardt", "Ulrike BKottler"], "doi": "10.1097/IJG.0b013e3181e080ef"}

There was no significant difference for placental measurements for VI, FI and VFI between the second trimester and the third trimester pregnancies. Concerning the myometrium, we observed no significant difference between second and third trimester for FI. However, VI (28.090 vs. 19.374) and VFI (17.691 vs. 11.336) was significantly lower in the third trimester (p < 0.01).\n3D quantification of placental and myometrial vascular parameters is feasible with a high intra and inter-observer reproducibility.

{"title": "The effect of platelet-rich plasma on the neovascularization of surgically created equine superficial digital flexor tendon lesions.", "abstract": "The repair process of tendon injuries, which are common in both human and equine athletes, is slow and the quality of the repair tissue is often inferior to the original tendon tissue, which frequently leads to re-injury. The relatively poor vascularization of tendons is considered to be one of the reasons for their limited healing potential. Recently, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), an autologous concentrate of platelets, rich in growth factors, has been shown to enhance the repair process of injured tendons. This effect has been ascribed to the high levels of growth factors in PRP, several of which are known to be involved in tendon repair. Among many other growth factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor, a powerful stimulator of angiogenesis, is abundantly present in PRP, suggesting that enhancement of neovascularization might be one of the working mechanisms. In this study, the effect of PRP on neovascularization was studied in experimentally induced tendon injuries using color Doppler ultrasonography and immunological staining of Factor VIII. PRP induced significantly more neovascularization than the placebo treatment until at least 23 weeks after treatment, as detected by both Doppler ultrasonography and Factor VIII staining. Neovascularization might be one of the explanations for the long-lasting effect of a single intratendinous treatment with PRP.", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports", "date": "2010-05-13", "authors": ["GBosch", "MMoleman", "ABarneveld", "P Rvan Weeren", "H T Mvan Schie"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01070.x"}

The primary aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of US and the sensitivity for localizing parathyroid glands with a volume \u2265 500 mm(3). The secondary aim was to assess the parameters that define parathyroid glandular perfusion.\nThe diagnostic use of US was assessed in 40 consecutive uremic patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) who were receiving maintenance hemodialysis or conservative therapy with a hypoproteic-hypophosphoric diet and had undergone parathyroidectomy. Prior to surgery (99m)TC-sestamibi scintigraphy (SM) was performed in all patients.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy of US were 74 %, 75 %, 98 %, and 74 %, respectively. The sensitivity for localizing glands with a volume \u2265 500 mm(3) was 90 %. US and SM had a combined sensitivity of 83 %. The vascularization of parathyroid glands became more evident with increasing glandular volume. With CDI, the signs of hypervascularization (i. e. an enlarged feeding artery at the hilum, a peripheral arc of vascularity and/or ray-like endonodular vessels) were present in 77 % of glands with a volume \u2265 500 mm(3).\nThe sensitivity of US is higher than that of SM, but it cannot be compared with that of parathyroidectomy (74 vs. 95 %). However, US/CDI is able to characterize glands with different volumes and vascular patterns. Since glandular volume and vascularization are indicative of the severity of sHPT, this study suggests that the main role of US/CDI in the setting of sHPT should be to complete the diagnosis and to evaluate the morphological changes of enlarged glands during uremia in order to define surgical timing, rather than to assess the presurgical location of glands.", "journal": "Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)", "date": "2010-04-24", "authors": ["MMeola", "IPetrucci", "FCalliada", "MBarsotti", "MPuccini", "MGrosso", "GBarsotti"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0029-1245236"}

At 150 days of age, i.e., before first heat, 20 gilts were randomly divided into two experimental groups: treated (n=10) and control (n=10). The treated group received a daily dose of 400 \u03bcg of L-thyroxine (T(4)) in their diet until slaughter and the control group received only typical meals. Before artificial insemination, blood was collected to determine plasma total T(4). The gilts were inseminated in the second oestrus and slaughtered at 70 days of gestation. The foetal thyroid follicular epithelium height, number, size and weight of foetuses; foetal myogenesis, corpora lutea number, embryonic mortality rate, uterine weight, placental weight and placental fluid volume were measured. Histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analysis of uterus and placenta were determined. The averages of all variables were compared by the Student's t-test. The gilts treated with thyroxine showed significant increase of plasma total T(4). At 70 days of gestation, the heights of the trophoblastic epithelium, endometrial epithelium and endometrial gland epithelium were significantly higher in the group treated with T(4). The expression of cytoplasmatic and nuclear VEGF in trophoblastic cells and the number of blood vessels per field in endometrial stroma were significantly higher in the gilts treated with T(4). No other significant differences between groups were obtained with respect to other parameters (p>0.05).

This effect has been attributed to IFN-\u03b3 preventing tumor stroma formation but not to a direct effect on the cancer cells. However, it is not known, which influence IFN-\u03b3 has on tumors with an established stroma. To address this question, the plasmacytoma cell line J558L was transduced with a vector allowing doxycycline-inducible IFN-\u03b3 gene expression. After the injection of the tumor cells into mice, IFN-\u03b3 was induced at different time points. Tumors did not grow when inducing IFN-\u03b3 immediately after tumor cell inoculation, while approximately half of the tumors were rejected when IFN-\u03b3 was induced in early established tumors within 2 weeks. Induction of IFN-\u03b3 2-3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation was less efficient (0-17% rejection). IFN-\u03b3 induction in established tumors led to a reduction of CD146(+) endothelial cells and massive necrosis. Together, we show that vascularized tumors can be rejected by local IFN-\u03b3 expression, but that rejection of established tumors was less efficient over time. This suggests that transplanted tumors became less susceptible to local IFN-\u03b3 treatment the better they are established.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2010-03-25", "authors": ["DanaBriesemeister", "DanielSommermeyer", "ChristophLoddenkemper", "RainerLoew", "WolfgangUckert", "ThomasBlankenstein", "ThomasKammertoens"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.25350"}

We have studied the effect of genetic deletion of PAI-1 on inflammation, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and tumor progression.

Indeed, recent evidence indicates that neuronal guidance factors and their receptors function as angiogenic regulators. As neural guidance cues, netrin-1 is the most extensively studied gene in the field of angiogenesis. Despite achieving some advances in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in angiogenesis, there are still a certain number of patients who fail to respond to cell therapy. Thus, a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the angiogenic property of transplanted cells is desirable.

Netrin-1 and/or MSCs were injected directly into the muscle of the ischemic limb. Gross appearance of ischemic limb, collateral vessel formation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level were assessed 28 d after treatment.\nThe results showed that pretreatment of MSCs with a recombinant netrin-1 protein markedly augmented the angiographic score and capillary density, improved function of the ischemic limb, and increased levels of VEGF in the plasma and damaged tissues. Further studies assaying the cell migration and network formation suggested that netrin-1 promoted MSC migration and enhanced its ability to participate in tube formation.\nThese results demonstrated that transplantation of MSCs pretreated with netrin-1 protein significantly improved the therapeutic effect of MSCs and, therefore, may provide a novel therapeutic approach for ischemic disease.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2010-01-15", "authors": ["QianLi", "DanYao", "JianhuaMa", "JianZhu", "XianghongXu", "YunliRen", "XinshengDing", "XiaomingMao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2009.08.031"}

Materials that promote the formation of vascularized adipose tissue may offer alternatives to current clinical treatment options.

{"title": "Advances in endoscopic visualization of colorectal polyps.", "abstract": "Conventional white-light endoscopy is currently the gold standard for the detection and treatment of colorectal polyps. However, up to a fifth of polyps may be missed on initial examination, especially flat and small mucosal lesions. This study reviews the literature reporting on the use of new advances in endoscopic visualization.\nLiterature searches were performed on PubMed using the terms 'chromoendoscopy', 'narrow-band imaging' (NBI), 'autofluorescence imaging' (AFI), 'Fujinon Intelligent Colour Enhancement' (FICE), 'i-Scan colonoscopy', 'zoom colonoscopy' and 'confocal laser endomicroscopy' (CLE). We focused on systematic reviews, national guidelines and randomized controlled trials written in English. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using QUADAS. Prospective studies assessing new technology were also reviewed. Further publications were identified from reference lists.\nChromoendoscopy increases the detection of neoplastic polyps compared with conventional colonoscopy. NBI avoids the use of additional dyes and enhances the vascular network of capillaries surrounding the crypts, increasing the adenoma detection rate and the ability to distinguish between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. FICE, AFI and i-Scan are new developments that improve tissue contrast. Zoom endoscopy may be combined with different modalities to help further characterize colonic lesions. CLE provides live in vivo high-resolution optical sections of tissue and may be particularly useful in the surveillance of patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis, reducing the number of random biopsies.\nAlthough there is mounting evidence that these new technologies are superior to conventional endoscopy, current guidelines are limited. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing these modalities in different patient subpopulations are warranted.", "journal": "Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland", "date": "2009-11-26", "authors": ["T MYeung", "N JMortensen"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1463-1318.2009.02142.x"}
{"title": "Potential use of circulating endothelial cells as a biomarker of renal cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Each year, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for significant mortality in the population. Whilst the disease is now being diagnosed earlier, determining patient prognosis remains a challenge. Current prognostic indicators, such as TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, and RCC subtype, are inadequate. Unlike several other malignancies, RCC lacks a biomarker that can stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk for developing metastases. Additionally, antiangiogenic therapy is currently offered to patients with metastatic disease, however, a biomarker to monitor treatment efficacy is lacking. Recent attention has focused on surrogate markers of tumor vascularization as a source of prognostic biomarkers, as tumor growth is ultimately dependent on neovascularization. Two cell populations of interest, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs), have been demonstrated across several studies to contribute to tumor vascularization. Given these findings, studies have examined their utility as biomarkers of prognosis by correlating their levels with progression-free survival and prognostic determinants such as tumor volume and weight. However, their role in predicting prognosis in RCC, as well as their potential to act as markers of treatment efficacy in metastatic RCC, remains to be established. Previous studies on CECs and CEPs in the context of cancer will be outlined in this review.", "journal": "Urologic oncology", "date": "2009-11-17", "authors": ["Kevin V STan", "BenjaminNamdarian", "Anthony JCostello", "Christopher MHovens"], "doi": "10.1016/j.urolonc.2009.07.001"}
{"title": "Rosiglitazone (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma) counters hypertension and adverse cardiac and vascular remodeling in 2K1C hypertensive rats.", "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists have been shown controlling blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats and salt-sensitive hypertensive rats. The present study aims to test the hypothesis that PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone has beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular adverse remodeling in a model of renovascular hypertension (two-kidneys-one-clip, 2K1C model). Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n=6): SHAM group, 2K1C, 2K1C+HYD (treated with hydralazine for 5 weeks) and 2K1C+ROSI (treated with rosiglitazone for 5 weeks). The left ventricle (LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and common carotid artery (CCA) were analyzed. The BP did not show significant difference at the end of the experiment in groups 2K1C+ROSI, 2K1C+HYD and SHAM. The LV mass was smaller in 2K1C+ROSI compared with the other groups. The intima-media thickness was smaller in 2K1C+ROSI compared with untreated 2K1C ones, but not in 2K1C+HYD; 2K1C and 2K1C+HYD showed smaller Ao and CCA density of smooth muscle cell nuclei, and smaller surface density of the elastic lamellae than SHAM. The Ao and CCA circumferential wall tension and tensile stress were greater in 2K1C than in SHAM. Hypertrophied cardiomyocytes were seen in 2K1C, but not in 2K1C+ROSI and SHAM; 2K1C+ROSI had enhanced volume and length densities of intramyocardial arteries than 2K1C. The volume density of cardiac interstitium was greater in 2K1C and 2K1C+HYD than in SHAM. In conclusion, PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone has beneficial effects controlling BP, reducing vascular adverse remodeling, and preserving intramyocardial vascularization in renovascular hypertensive rats (2K1C model).", "journal": "Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie", "date": "2009-09-25", "authors": ["Geraldo de OliveiraSilva-Junior", "Thiago da SilvaTorres", "Leonardo de SouzaMendonca", "Carlos AlbertoMandarim-de-Lacerda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.etp.2009.09.001"}

{"title": "Immunohistochemical analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and p53 expression in pterygium from Tunisian patients.", "abstract": "A pterygium is characterized by abnormal fibrovascular corneoconjunctival tissue. A number of investigations have attempted to elucidate this incompletely understood pathology. Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and p53 are known to participate in tumor vascularization, our purpose was to study VEGF and p53 expression in active primary and recurrent pterygium from Tunisian patients. To this end, 15\u00a0cases of active primary pterygium and five cases of recurrent pterygium from Tunisia were studied by immunohistochemistry. Antibodies raised against VEGF and p53 were used to analyze the distribution and expression of these markers in pterygium and normal human conjunctiva were used as negative control. VEGF and p53 proteins were found in all cases of primary pterygium in epithelial, fibroblast and vascular endothelial cells. Active primary and recurrent pterygium have different patterns of expression. In primary pterygium, an important variability of p53 and VEGF expression was observed. However, in recurrent pterygium, p53 immunoreactivity was weak to moderate, whereas VEGF immunoreactivity was strong. In normal human conjunctiva, VEGF and p53 expression was weak to negative. The overexpression of VEGF in active primary and recurrent pterygium suggests that angiogenesis may play a role in pterygium pathogenesis and the expression of p53 in active primary pterygium, which might be associated with its mutated form, supports the hypothesis that actinic radiation may be involved in the genesis of pterygium. Thus, VEGF and p53 may be useful biomarkers for understanding the physiopathology of pterygium.", "journal": "Pathologie-biologie", "date": "2009-06-02", "authors": ["TKhalfaoui", "GMkannez", "DColin", "AImen", "WZbiba", "KErrais", "RAnane", "OBeltaief", "RZhioua", "JBen Hamida", "GLizard", "AOuertani-Meddeb"], "doi": "10.1016/j.patbio.2009.04.006"}
{"title": "Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma presenting as multiple colonic polyps.", "abstract": "A 92-year-old male presented for routine endoscopic surveillance of his gastrointestinal (GI) tract. He did not have any GI symptoms currently, and the patient had undergone a right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma 17 years previously. A lower GI endoscopy revealed polyps in the ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon (2 polyps). All the polyps were snared and removed in toto. Histological evaluation of all 4 polyps showed similar features. There was expansion of the lamina propria by sheets of clear cells arranged in a nested pattern with a rich vascular network. Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor to be positive for low-molecular-weight cytokeratin, CD10, and vimentin. The features were morphologically and immunophenotypically that of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This case highlights an extremely unusual presentation of recurrent renal cell carcinoma as multiple, separate colonic polyps 17 years after resection of the primary tumor.", "journal": "International journal of surgical pathology", "date": "2009-05-05", "authors": ["RunjanChetty", "AbdulSyed", "Theodorusvan der Kwast"], "doi": "10.1177/1066896909333750"}
