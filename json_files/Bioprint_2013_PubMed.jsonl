Treating surgeons and first assistants completed a questionnaire assigning a fracture type according to the Broberg and Morrey modification of Mason's classification, evaluating selected fracture characteristics, and electing preferred management based upon radiographs and 2D images alone; then adding 3D-CT; then 3D printed physical models; and finally intra-operative visualization. The addition of the 3D CT and physical models improved the sensitivity for fracture line separating the entire head from the neck, comminution of the radial neck, fracture involving the articular surface, articular fracture gap greater than 2\u00a0mm, impacted fracture fragments, greater than 3 articular fragments, and articular fragments judged too small to repair. There were no significant differences in diagnostic performance with the addition of 3D models. The addition of 3D CT and models improved the reliability of Broberg and Morrey classification. We conclude that 3DCT and 3D physical modeling provide more accurate fracture classification and characterization of fracture of the radial head with less proposed variability in treatment.

After the 3D printing process using the functionalized ink, the surface readily binds with the Br terminated initiator for the following surface modification. Moreover, since the initiator exists in the bulk material and thus the entire printed structure, if needed, any damaged surface can be easily re-painted with a single step of the ATRP polymerization process. To demonstrate the technique, 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SPMA) was grafted onto the surface and the adhesion of bacteria was significantly reduced.

Cells were efficiently transfected by the plasmid DNA, and differentiated towards the osteogenic lineage as shown by elevated BMP-2 and ALP production. Porous constructs performed in the first week were better in producing BMP-2 than solid constructs.

The coaxial fibre membranes having small fibre diameter (541\u00a0nm) and a thick gelatin shell (52%) did not affect the sensor sensitivity, but decreased sensor's linearity in the long run. In contrast, thicker coaxial fibre membranes (1133\u00a0nm) having a thin gelatin shell (34%) maintained both sensitivity and linearity for the 84\u00a0days of the study period. To conclude, polyurethane-gelatin coaxial fibre membranes, due to their faster permeability to glucose, tailorable mechanical properties and bioactivity, are potential candidates for coatings to favourably modify the host responses to extend the reliable in vivo lifetime of implantable glucose biosensors.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["NingWang", "KrishnaBurugapalli", "ShaviniWijesuriya", "Mahshid YazdiFar", "WenhuiSong", "FrancisMoussy", "YudongZheng", "YanxuanMa", "ZhentaoWu", "KangLi"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015002"}

We observed that RGC and glia can be successfully printed using a piezoelectric printer. Whilst inkjet printing reduced the cell population due to sedimentation within the printing system, imaging of the printhead nozzle, which is the area where the cells experience the greatest shear stress and rate, confirmed that there was no evidence of destruction or even significant distortion of the cells during jet ejection and drop formation. Importantly, the viability of the cells was not affected by the printing process. When we cultured the same number of printed and non-printed RGC/glial cells, there was no significant difference in cell survival and RGC neurite outgrowth. In addition, use of a glial substrate significantly increased RGC neurite outgrowth, and this effect was retained when the cells had been printed. In conclusion, printing of RGC and glia using a piezoelectric printhead does not adversely affect viability and survival/growth of the cells in culture. Importantly, printed glial cells retain their growth-promoting properties when used as a substrate, opening new avenues for printed CNS grafts in regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["BarbaraLorber", "Wen-KaiHsiao", "Ian MHutchings", "Keith RMartin"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015001"}

{"title": "Three-dimensional printed trileaflet valve conduits using biological hydrogels and human valve interstitial cells.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering has great potential to provide a functional de novo living valve replacement, capable of integration with host tissue and growth. Among various valve conduit fabrication techniques, three-dimensional (3-D) bioprinting enables deposition of cells and hydrogels into 3-D constructs with anatomical geometry and heterogeneous mechanical properties. Successful translation of this approach, however, is constrained by the dearth of printable and biocompatible hydrogel materials. Furthermore, it is not known how human valve cells respond to these printed environments. In this study, 3-D printable formulations of hybrid hydrogels are developed, based on methacrylated hyaluronic acid (Me-HA) and methacrylated gelatin (Me-Gel), and used to bioprint heart valve conduits containing encapsulated human aortic valvular interstitial cells (HAVIC). Increasing Me-Gel concentration resulted in lower stiffness and higher viscosity, facilitated cell spreading, and better maintained HAVIC fibroblastic phenotype. Bioprinting accuracy was dependent upon the relative concentrations of Me-Gel and Me-HA, but when optimized enabled the fabrication of a trileaflet valve shape accurate to the original design. HAVIC encapsulated within bioprinted heart valves maintained high viability, and remodeled the initial matrix by depositing collagen and glyosaminoglycans. These findings represent the first rational design of bioprinted trileaflet valve hydrogels that regulate encapsulated human VIC behavior. The use of anatomically accurate living valve scaffolds through bioprinting may accelerate understanding of physiological valve cell interactions and progress towards de novo living valve replacements.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-12-18", "authors": ["BDuan", "EKapetanovic", "L AHockaday", "J TButcher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.12.005\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2013.0258"}

Spinal reconstruction and stabilisation, and bone defect repair play a crucial role in the surgical treatment of spinal TB. Unfortunately, the existing materials have not completely met the requirements for spinal TB reconstruction due to their diverse deficiencies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel reconstructing implants. Poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) are two promising drug delivery systems (DDS) and materials for bone repair, which could help us to overcome the difficulties in spinal TB reconstruction in the future. In this article, we discuss the properties of PDLLA and nHA, two potential drug delivering and bone repair materials for spinal TB reconstruction. We also presented two alternatives for spinal TB in future. Two strategies have the potential for treating spinal TB in the future. One such strategy consists of mixing anti-TB drugs, PDLLA with nHA to fabricate a novel three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffold via 3D printing (3DP) technology. Another is preparing a novel titanium mesh implant coated with drugs/PDLLA/nHA composites by solvent evaporation and low-temperature drying technology.

However, although the computed tomography (CT) data were analyzed using centerline of flow, the true neck length and relations of the ostial origins were difficult to determine. No multidisciplinary consensus could be reached as to which stent-graft to use owing to these borderline features of the neck anatomy. Based on past experience with rapid prototyping technology, a decision was taken to print a model of the aneurysm to aid in visualization of the neck anatomy. The CT data were segmented, processed, and converted into a stereolithographic format representing the lumen as a 3D volume, from which a full-sized replica was printed within 24 hours. The model demonstrated that the neck was adequate for stent-graft repair using the Aorfix device.\nRapid prototyping of aortic aneurysms is feasible and can aid decision making and device delivery.

The use of DoD technology allows for precise control over the material properties, drug solid state form, drop size, and drop dynamics and can be beneficial in the creation of high-potency drug forms, combination drugs with multiple APIs or individualized medicine products tailored to a specific patient. In this work, DAMPP was used to create dosage forms from solvent-based formulations consisting of API, polymer, and solvent carrier. The forms were then analyzed to determine the reproducibility of creating an on-target dosage form, the morphology of the API of the final form and the dissolution behavior of the drug over time.

One solution to this problem is to use computer-guided surgical planning and additive manufacturing technology to produce patient-specific reconstruction plates. However, when designing customized plates, it is important to assess potential biomechanical responses that may vary substantially depending on the size and geometry of the defect. The aim of this study was to assess the design of two customized plates using finite element method (FEM). These plates were designed for the reconstruction of the lower left mandibles of two ameloblastoma cases (patient 1/plate 1 and patient 2/plate 2) with large bone resections differing in both geometry and size. Simulations revealed maximum von Mises stresses of 63 MPa and 108 MPa in plates 1 and 2, and 65 MPa and 190 MPa in the fixation screws of patients 1 and 2. The equivalent strain induced in the bone at the screw-bone interface reached maximum values of 2739 micro-strain for patient 1 and 19,575 micro-strain for patient 2. The results demonstrate the influence of design on the stresses induced in the plate and screw bodies. Of particular note, however, are the differences in the induced strains. Unphysiologically high strains in bone adjacent to screws can cause micro-damage leading to bone resorption. This can adversely affect the anchoring capabilities of the screws. Thus, while custom plates offer optimal anatomical fit, attention should be paid to the expected physiological forces on the plates and the induced stresses and strains in the plate-screw-bone assembly.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2013-12-03", "authors": ["NathanielNarra", "Ji\u0159\u00edVal\u00e1\u0161ek", "MarkusHannula", "PetrMarci\u00e1n", "George KS\u00e1ndor", "JariHyttinen", "JanWolff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.11.016"}

Yet, there is a concern that flow-perfusion may induce unwanted mechanical effects on chondrogenesis and terminal differentiation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of fluid flow on chondrogenesis and chondrocyte hypertrophy of MSCs in a well-established pellet culture model. Human MSC pellets were mounted into 3D-printed porous scaffolds in basic chondrogenic differentiation medium, containing TGF-\u03b22. Constructs were then allowed to form cartilaginous matrix for 18 days, before they were transferred to a custom-built flow-perfusion system. A continuous flow of 1.22ml min(-1) was applied to the constructs for 10 days. Controls were maintained under static culture conditions. To evaluate chondrogenic and hypertrophic differentiation, RNA was isolated at day 20 and 28 and histology, immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses were performed after 28 days of culture. Abundant matrix was formed in the constructs, but production of chondrogenic and hypertrophic matrix components was affected by flow-perfusion. Although gene expression levels of the (late) hypertrophic and osteogenic marker osteocalcin increased by flow-perfusion, this did not result in more collagen type X protein deposition. Decreased GAG release, in combination with diminished collagen II staining, indicates reduced chondrogenesis in response to flow-perfusion. Caution should thus be taken when applying flow-perfusion to cultures to improve nutrient diffusion.

The reduction of Au ions to Au(0) was achieved using a natural electron-donating cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which was regenerated by the glycerol dehydrogenase (GLD) enzyme. First, we selected the A3 peptide (AYSSGAPPMPPF) as a gold binding moiety. The A3 peptide was introduced to the C-terminus of fusion proteins of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding domains of protein G and protein A. In the presence of the recombinant protein, the GLD-catalyzed cofactor reduction resulted in the efficient in situ fabrication of Au NPs immobilized with the fusion protein. Moreover, the protein-immobilized Au NPs were shown to have IgG binding activity. Although the A3 peptide had the ability to stabilize Au NPs, the results suggested that its binding affinity for Au NPs was unexpectedly weaker than that of His-tag. A cysteine residue was thus introduced to a recombinant protein adjacent to the A3 peptide. Finally, an artificial peptide, comprising A3 sequence with the C-terminal single cysteine residue, enabled the stable display of a fusion protein while maintaining its IgG binding activity through the Au-S bond. This enzyme-assisted one-pot methodology for protein-Au NPs conjugation offers one potent route for the facile fabrication of biomolecule-decorated metal NPs.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["TeppeiNiide", "KojiroShimojo", "RieWakabayashi", "MasahiroGoto", "NorihoKamiya"], "doi": "10.1021/la401327h"}

To reproducibly and reliably build such grafts of composite geometry we use bioprinting. We test our grafts in a rat sciatic nerve injury model for both motor and sensory function. In particular we compare the regenerative capacity of the biofabricated grafts with that of autologous grafts and grafts made of hollow collagen tubes by measuring the compound action potential (for motor function) and the change in mean arterial blood pressure as consequence of electrically eliciting the somatic pressor reflex.

Herein, we present a novel, laser-based method for single-step fabrication and precise planar placement of alginate microbeads. Our results show that bead size is controllable within 8%, and fabricated microbeads can remain immobilized within 2% of their target placement. Demonstration of this technique using human breast cancer cells shows that cells encapsulated within these microbeads survive at a rate of 89.6%, decreasing to 84.3% after five days in culture.

In this study, a novel integrated automated system for the production and in\u00a0vitro culture of 3D constructs, known as BioCell Printing, was used only to manufacture poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) scaffolds for tissue engineering; the influence of pore size and shape on their mechanical and biological performances was investigated. Imposing a single lay-down pattern of 0\u00b0/90\u00b0 and varying the filament distance, it was possible to produce scaffolds with square interconnected pores with channel sizes falling in the range of 245-433\u00a0\u00b5m, porosity 49-57% and a constant road width. Three different lay-down patterns were also adopted (0\u00b0/90\u00b0, 0\u00b0/60/120\u00b0 and 0\u00b0/45\u00b0/90\u00b0/135\u00b0), thus resulting in scaffolds with quadrangular, triangular and complex internal geometries, respectively.

A hydrogel composite including alginate and gelatin precursors was tuned with different concentrations of hydroxyapatite (HA) and characterized in terms of rheology, swelling behavior and mechanical properties to assess the versatility of the system. Instantaneous as well as long-term structural integrity of the printed hydrogel was achieved with a two-step mechanism combining the thermosensitive properties of gelatin with chemical crosslinking of alginate. Novel syringe tip heaters were developed for improved temperature control of the bioink to avoid clogging. Human mesenchymal stem cells mixed into the hydrogel precursor survived the printing process and showed high cell viability of 85% living cells after 3 days of subsequent in vitro culture. HA enabled the visualization of the printed structures with micro-computed tomography. The inclusion of HA also favors the use of the bioink for bone tissue engineering applications. By adding factors other than HA, the composite could be used as a bioink for applications in drug delivery, microsphere deposition or soft tissue engineering.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-10-26", "authors": ["SilkeW\u00fcst", "Marie EGodla", "RalphM\u00fcller", "SandraHofmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.10.016"}
{"title": "Terahertz plasmonic waveguides created via 3D printing.", "abstract": "We demonstrate that 3D printing, commonly associated with the manufacture of large objects, allows for the fabrication of high quality terahertz (THz) plasmonic structures. Using a commercial 3D printer, we print a variety of structures that include abrupt out-of-plane bends and continuously varying bends. The waveguides are initially printed in a polymer resin and then sputter deposited with ~500 nm of Au. This thickness of Au is sufficient to support low loss propagation of surface plasmon-polaritons with minimal impact from the underlying layer, thereby demonstrating a useful approach for fabricating a broad range of plasmonic structures that incorporate complex geometries. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we measure the guided-wave properties of these devices. We find that the propagation properties of the guided-wave modes are similar to those obtained in similar conventional metal-based waveguides, albeit with slightly higher loss. This additional loss is attributed to roughness associated with limitations that currently exist in commercial 3D printers.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2013-10-24", "authors": ["ShashankPandey", "BarunGupta", "AjayNahata"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.21.024422"}
{"title": "A new model with an anatomically accurate human renal collecting system for training in fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy access.", "abstract": "Obtaining renal access is one of the most important and complex steps in learning percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Ideally, this skill should be practiced outside the operating room. There is a need for anatomically accurate and cheap models for simulated training. The objective was to develop a cost-effective, anatomically accurate, nonbiologic training model for simulated PCNL access under fluoroscopic guidance.\nCollecting systems from routine computed tomography urograms were extracted and reformatted using specialized software. These images were printed in a water-soluble plastic on a three-dimensional (3D) printer to create biomodels. These models were embedded in silicone and then the models were dissolved in water to leave a hollow collecting system within a silicone model. These PCNL models were filled with contrast medium and sealed. A layer of dense foam acted as a spacer to replicate the tissues between skin and kidney.\n3D printed models of human collecting systems are a useful adjunct in planning PCNL access. The PCNL access training model is relatively low cost and reproduces the anatomy of the renal collecting system faithfully. A range of models reflecting the variety and complexity of human collecting systems can be reproduced. The fluoroscopic triangulation process needed to target the calix of choice can be practiced successfully in this model.\nThis silicone PCNL training model accurately replicates the anatomic architecture and orientation of the human renal collecting system. It provides a safe, clean, and effective model for training in accurate fluoroscopy-guided PCNL access.", "journal": "Journal of endourology", "date": "2013-10-24", "authors": ["Benjamin WTurney"], "doi": "10.1089/end.2013.0616"}

We discuss models that are most amenable to high throughput screening with emphasis on detection platforms and data modeling.\nModeling 3D tissues to mimic in-vivo architecture remains a major challenge.

In this work, design of experiments (DoE) was used to customize post AM surface treatment for 3D selective laser melted Ti6Al4V open porous structures for bone tissue engineering. A two-level three-factor full factorial design was employed to assess the individual and interactive effects of the surface treatment duration and the concentration of the chemical etching solution on the final surface roughness and beam thickness of the treated porous structures. It was observed that the concentration of the surface treatment solution was the most important factor influencing roughness reduction. The designed beam thickness decreased the effectiveness of the surface treatment. In this case study, the optimized processing conditions for AM production and the post-AM surface treatment were defined based on the DoE output and were validated experimentally.

{"title": "Auxetic oesophageal stents: structure and mechanical properties.", "abstract": "Oesophageal cancer is the ninth leading cause of malignant cancer death and its prognosis remains poor, ranking as the sixth most frequent cause of death in the world. This research work aims to adopt an Auxetic (rotating-squares) geometry device, that had previously been examined theoretically and analysed by Grima and Evans (J Mater Sci Lett 19(17):1563-1565, 2000), to produce a novel Auxetic oesophageal stent and stent-grafts relevant to the palliative treatment of oesophageal cancer and also for the prevention of dysphagia. This paper discusses the manufacture of a small diameter Auxetic oesophageal stent and stent-graft. The oral deployment of such an Auxetic stent would be simplest if a commercial balloon dilatational catheter was used as this obviates the need for an expensive dedicated delivery system. A novel manufacturing route was employed in this research to develop both Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents, which ranged from conventional subtractive techniques to a new additive manufacturing method. Polyurethane was selected as a material for the fabrication of Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents because of its good biocompatibility and non-toxicological properties. The Auxetic films were later used for the fabrication of seamed Auxetic oesophageal stents. The flexible polyurethane tubular grafts were also attached to the inner luminal side of the seamless Auxetic oesophageal stents, in order to prevent tumour in-growth. Scanning electron microscopy was used to conduct surface morphology study by using different Auxetic specimens developed from different conventional and new additive manufacturing techniques. Tensile testing of the Auxetic films was performed to characterise their mechanical properties. The stent expansion tests of the Auxetic stents were done to analyse the longitudinal extension and radial expansion of the Auxetic stent at a range of radial pressures applied by the balloon catheter, and to also identify the pressure values where the Auxetic stent fails. Finite element models of both Auxetic film and Auxetic stent were developed, and the results were compared with experimental results with a good agreement. The tensile testing of the Auxetic polyurethane films revealed that the Poisson's ratio of the sample ranged between -0.87 and -0.963 at different uniaxial tensile load values. From the stent expansion test, it was found that the Auxetic oesophageal stent radially expanded from 0.5 to 5.73\u00a0mm and longitudinally extended from 0.15 to 1.83\u00a0mm at a range of applied pressure increments (0.5-2.7\u00a0bar) from the balloon catheter.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

A microscopic grid network was created by rapid prototyping making a 3D-fused deposition model (FDM-PCL). Afterward, the FDM-PCL scaffolds were infused with a mixture of PCL, water, and 1,4-dioxane and underwent a thermal-induced phase separation (TIPS) followed by lyophilization. The TIPS process lead to a nanoporous structure shielded by the printed microstructure (NSP-PCL). Sixteen Landrace pigs were divided into two groups with 8 and 12 weeks follow-up, respectively.

Ti6Al4V alloy powder premixed with 5wt% and 15wt% of boron nitride (BN) powder was used to synthesize TiB-TiN reinforcements in situ during laser deposition. Influences of laser power, scanning speed and concentration of BN on the microstructure, mechanical, in vitro tribological and biological properties of the coatings were investigated. Microstructural analysis of the composite coatings showed that the high temperature generated due to laser interaction with Ti6Al4V alloy and BN results in situ formation of TiB and TiN phases. With increasing BN concentration, from 5wt% to 15wt%, the Young's modulus of the composite coatings, measured by nanoindentation, increased from 170\u00b15GPa to 204\u00b114GPa. In vitro tribological tests showed significant increase in the wear resistance with increasing BN concentration. Under identical test conditions TiB-TiN composite coatings with 15wt% BN exhibited an order of magnitude less wear rate than CoCrMo alloy-a common material for articulating surfaces of orthopedic implants.

Although most in vitro studies examine bacterial properties averaged over large populations, the levels of key molecular determinants of bacterial fitness and pathogenicity (e.g., oxygen, quorum-sensing signals) may vary over micrometer scales within small, dense cellular aggregates believed to play key roles in disease transmission. A detailed understanding of how cell-cell interactions contribute to pathogenicity in natural, complex environments will require a new level of control in constructing more relevant cellular models for assessing bacterial phenotypes. Here, we describe a microscopic three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy that enables multiple populations of bacteria to be organized within essentially any 3D geometry, including adjacent, nested, and free-floating colonies. In this laser-based lithographic technique, microscopic containers are formed around selected bacteria suspended in gelatin via focal cross-linking of polypeptide molecules. After excess reagent is removed, trapped bacteria are localized within sealed cavities formed by the cross-linked gelatin, a highly porous material that supports rapid growth of fully enclosed cellular populations and readily transmits numerous biologically active species, including polypeptides, antibiotics, and quorum-sensing signals.

However, the fatigue behavior of this biomaterial is not yet well understood. We studied the fatigue behavior of porous structures made of Ti6Al4V ELI powder using selective laser melting. Four different porous structures were manufactured with porosities between 68 and 84% and the fatigue S-N curves of these four porous structures were determined. The three-stage mechanism of fatigue failure of these porous structures is described and studied in detail. It was found that the absolute S-N curves of these four porous structures are very different. In general, given the same absolute stress level, the fatigue life is much shorter for more porous structures. However, the normalized fatigue S-N curves of these four structures were found to be very similar. A power law was fitted to all data points of the normalized S-N curves. It is shown that the measured data points conform to the fitted power law very well, R(2)=0.94. This power law may therefore help in estimating the fatigue life of porous structures for which no fatigue test data is available.

{"title": "Biofabrication under fluorocarbon: a novel freeform fabrication technique to generate high aspect ratio tissue-engineered constructs.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is a recent development in tissue engineering, which applies rapid prototyping techniques to generate complex living tissues. Typically, cell-containing hydrogels are dispensed layer-by-layer according to a computer-generated three-dimensional model. The lack of mechanical stability of printed hydrogels hinders the fabrication of high aspect ratio constructs. Here we present submerged bioprinting, a novel technique for freeform fabrication of hydrogels in liquid fluorocarbon. The high buoyant density of fluorocarbons supports soft hydrogels by floating. Hydrogel constructs of up to 30-mm height were generated. Using 3% (w/v) agarose as the hydrogel and disposable syringe needles as nozzles, the printer produced features down to 570-\u03bcm diameter with a lateral dispensing accuracy of 89\u2009\u03bcm. We printed thin-walled hydrogel cylinders measuring 4.8\u2009mm in height, with an inner diameter of \u223c2.9\u2009mm and a minimal wall thickness of \u223c650\u2009\u03bcm. The technique was successfully applied in printing a model of an arterial bifurcation. We extruded under fluorocarbon, cellularized alginate tubes with 5-mm outer diameter and 3-cm length. Cells grew vigorously and formed clonal colonies within the 7-day culture period. Submerged bioprinting thus seems particularly suited to fabricate hollow structures with a high aspect ratio like vascular grafts for cardiovascular tissue engineering as well as branching or cantilever-like structures, obviating the need for a solid support beneath the overhanging protrusions.", "journal": "BioResearch open access", "date": "2013-10-02", "authors": ["AndreasBlaeser", "Daniela FDuarte Campos", "MichaelWeber", "SabineNeuss", "BenjaminTheek", "HorstFischer", "WilliJahnen-Dechent"], "doi": "10.1089/biores.2013.0031"}

It is focused on the analysis and correction of the results obtained by means of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), which is used to digitalize non-superficial biological parts along with a gauge part with calibrated dimensions. A correction of both the threshold and the voxel size in the tomographic images and the final reconstruction is proposed. Finally, a comparison between a reconstruction of a gauge part using the proposed method and the reconstruction of that same gauge part using a standard method is shown. The increase in accuracy in the biomodel allows an improvement in medical applications based on image diagnosis, more accurate results in computational modelling, and improvements in surgical planning in situations in which the required accuracy directly affects the procedure's results.

Direct fabrication of scaffolds from 3DP, however, imposes a limitation on material choices by manufacturing processes. In this study, we report an indirect 3DP approach wherein a positive replica of desired shapes was printed using gelatin particles, and the final scaffold was directly produced from the printed mold. To create patient-specific scaffolds that match precisely to a patient's external contours, we integrated our indirect 3DP technique with imaging technologies and successfully created custom scaffolds mimicking human mandibular condyle using polycaprolactone and chitosan for potential osteochondral tissue engineering. To test the ability of the technique to precisely control the internal morphology of the scaffolds, we created orthogonal interconnected channels within the scaffolds using computer-aided-design models. Because very few biomaterials are truly osteoinductive, we modified inert 3D printed materials with bioactive apatite coating. The feasibility of these scaffolds to support cell growth was investigated using bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC).

Electrical inputs are particularly convenient to control, and there has been considerable effort to discover simple and generic mechanisms that allow electrical inputs to trigger protein assembly on-demand. Here, we report the electroaddressing of a protein to a patterned surface by coupling two generic electroaddressing mechanisms. First, we electrodeposit the stimuli-responsive film-forming aminopolysaccharide chitosan to form a hydrogel matrix at the electrode surface. After deposition, the matrix is chemically functionalized with alkyne groups. Second, we ''electro-click' an azide-tagged protein to the functionalized matrix using electrical signals to trigger conjugation by Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions. Specifically, a cathodic potential is applied to the matrix-coated electrode to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) which is required for the click reaction. Using fluorescently-labeled bovine serum albumin as our model, we demonstrate that protein conjugation can be controlled spatially and temporally. We anticipate that the coupling of polysaccharide electrodeposition and electro-click chemistry will provide a simple and generic approach to electroaddress proteins within compatible hydrogel matrices.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["Xiao-WenShi", "LingQiu", "ZhenNie", "LingXiao", "Gregory FPayne", "YuminDu"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/4/041001"}
{"title": "Relative impact of uniaxial alignment vs. form-induced stress on differentiation of human adipose derived stem cells.", "abstract": "ADSCs are a great cell source for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, the development of methods to appropriately manipulate these cells in vitro remains a challenge. Here the proliferation and differentiation of ADSCs on microfabricated surfaces with varying geometries were investigated. To create the patterned substrates, a maskless biofabrication method was developed based on dynamic optical projection stereolithography. Proliferation and early differentiation of ADSCs were compared across three distinct multicellular patterns, namely stripes (ST), symmetric fork (SF), and asymmetric fork (AF). The ST pattern was designed for uniaxial cell alignment while the SF and AF pattern were designed with altered cell directionality to different extents. The SF and AF patterns generated similar levels of regional peak stress, which were both significantly higher than those within the ST pattern. No significant difference in ADSC proliferation was observed among the three patterns. In comparison to the ST pattern, higher peak stress levels of the SF and AF patterns were associated with up-regulation of the chondrogenic and osteogenic markers SOX9 and RUNX2. Interestingly, uniaxial cell alignment in the ST pattern seemed to increase the expression of SM22\u03b1 and smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, suggesting an early smooth muscle lineage progression. These results indicate that geometric cues that promote uniaxial alignment might be more potent for myogenesis than those with increased peak stress.

Both these issues are addressed by demonstrating a method for preparing biodegradable and photo-patternable constructs, where modified cellulose is cross-linked to form an insoluble structure in an aqueous environment. Specifically, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is rendered photocrosslinkable by grafting with methylacrylic anhydride, whose linkages also render the cross-linked construct hydrolytically degradable. The HPC is then cross-linked via a photolithography-based fabrication process. The feasibility of functionalizing these HPC structures with biochemical cues is verified post-fabrication, and shown to facilitate the adhesion of mesenchymal progenitor cells. The HPC constructs are shown to be biocompatible and hydrolytically degradable, thus enabling cell proliferation and cell migration, and therefore constituting an ideal candidate for long-term cell culture and implantable tissue scaffold applications.

{"title": "25th anniversary article: Engineering hydrogels for biofabrication.", "abstract": "With advances in tissue engineering, the possibility of regenerating injured tissue or failing organs has become a realistic prospect for the first time in medical history. Tissue engineering - the combination of bioactive materials with cells to generate engineered constructs that functionally replace lost and/or damaged tissue - is a major strategy to achieve this goal. One facet of tissue engineering is biofabrication, where three-dimensional tissue-like structures composed of biomaterials and cells in a single manufacturing procedure are generated. Cell-laden hydrogels are commonly used in biofabrication and are termed \"bioinks\". Hydrogels are particularly attractive for biofabrication as they recapitulate several features of the natural extracellular matrix and allow cell encapsulation in a highly hydrated mechanically supportive three-dimensional environment. Additionally, they allow for efficient and homogeneous cell seeding, can provide biologically-relevant chemical and physical signals, and can be formed in various shapes and biomechanical characteristics. However, despite the progress made in modifying hydrogels for enhanced bioactivation, cell survival and tissue formation, little attention has so far been paid to optimize hydrogels for the physico-chemical demands of the biofabrication process. The resulting lack of hydrogel bioinks have been identified as one major hurdle for a more rapid progress of the field. In this review we summarize and focus on the deposition process, the parameters and demands of hydrogels in biofabrication, with special attention to robotic dispensing as an approach that generates constructs of clinically relevant dimensions. We aim to highlight this current lack of effectual hydrogels within biofabrication and initiate new ideas and developments in the design and tailoring of hydrogels.

AM-made samples displayed higher bending strengths (\u22481.2-1.4 times greater than CS-made samples), whereas elastic constant (i.e., effective elastic modulus of the porous structures) that is determined by material elastic modulus and structural geometry of the samples was \u22481.9-2.3 times greater for AM-made samples. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that samples made by either method displayed the same crystal structure forming \u03b2-CPP after sinter annealing. The material elastic modulus, E, determined using nanoindentation tests also showed the same value for both sample types (i.e., E \u2248 64 GPa). Examination of the porous structures indicated that significantly larger sinter necks resulted in the AM-made samples which presumably resulted in the higher mechanical properties. The development of mechanical properties was attributed to the different sinter anneal procedures required to make 35 vol % porous samples by the two methods. A primary objective of the present study, in addition to reporting on bending strength and sample stiffness (elastic constant) characteristics, was to determine why the two processes resulted in the observed mechanical property differences for samples of equivalent volume percentage of porosity.

Computational finite element (FE) models of each biopsy were subjected to a range of loads including compression, shear and torsion. The modelling framework was validated against three 3D printed models with known material properties subjected to compression till failure using an Instron machine. The primary outcomes from this study were that mechanical strength was not significantly correlated to low-dose (<10 mg/day) of fluoride levels (one-way ANOVA, P-values of 0.78, 0.69 and 0.62 for compression, shear and torsion, respectively). However, when bulk bone material properties were derived from DXA bone mineral density (BMD) from each patient's proximal femur a non-significant linear decline in mechanical strength with increase in fluoride was predicted. When the same material property was used for all bones (to evaluate bone architecture influence) then mechanical strength showed a characteristic concave upwards trend, consistent with the variation of micro CT derived percentage bone volume (BV/TV). The secondary outcomes from this study were that in compression, BV/TV was observed to be a strong surrogate measure for mechanical strength (R(2) = 0.83), while bone surface density (R(2)=0.6), trabecular thickness (R(2) = 0.5) and intersection surface (R(2) = 0.6) also explained the variation of mechanical strength well. However, trabecular separation and trabecular number were mildly correlated with mechanical strength (R(2) of 0.31 and 0.35, respectively). Compression was the loading mode most strongly correlated to micro CT indices. Material properties adapted from the proximal femur reduced the CT index correlations by up to 58% indicating that bulk density from a near proximity is a poor representation of specific localised density. Substituting the 3D micro CT indices with 2D histomorphometric data decreased correlations by at least 33% indicating that structural identification on a plane is not representative of the full 3D architecture necessary for a complete bone strength analysis.

Various shear stresses were applied to bovine endothelial cells (BECs) that were cultured on the artificially synthesized materials to obtain the suitable shear stress for growth enhancement.

These materials offer a hierarchical decomposition in modeling, with bulk properties that can be predicted from component measurements and deformation modes that can be determined by the placement of part types.

In this study, the effect of solvent on the electrospinning of PLLA fibrous yarns was investigated. For this purpose, yarns were electrospun using chloroform, dichloromethane or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as solvents at a PLLA concentration of 7 wt%. The analysis of the morphology, diameter, crystallinity and mechanical properties of electrospun yarns revealed that the vapor pressure of the solvent plays an important role. Whereas the fiber diameter decreased, the crystallinity of the fibers increased using a solvent with lower vapor pressure. In addition, mechanical properties (e.g., tensile strength and modulus) revealed that the yarns composed of fibers with smaller diameters showed higher tensile strength and modulus. In summary, fine-tuning solvent properties resulted in a modulation of fiber diameter, crystallinity, and thereby yarn mechanical properties, and are important factors to consider in the fabrication and application of electrospun yarns.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-08-16", "authors": ["HMaleki", "A AGharehaghaji", "LMoroni", "P JDijkstra"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/3/035014"}

Parallel microfibers have been shown to guide axon extension and Schwann cell migration on flat sheets via topographical cues. However, incorporation of aligned microfibers into 3D conduits to accelerate nerve regeneration has proven challenging. We report an electrospinning technique to incorporate parallel microfibers into 3D constructs at high surface areas while retaining an open architecture. The nerve guide consists of many microchannels lined with a thin layer of longitudinally-aligned microfibers. This design aims to maximize benefits of topographical cues without inhibiting cellular infiltration. We support this hypothesis by demonstrating efficient cell infiltration in vitro. Additionally, this new technique reduces wall thickness compared to our previous design, providing a greater total area for tissue growth. This approach results in an architecture that very closely mimics the structure of decellularized nerve but with larger microchannel diameters to encourage cell infiltration. We believe that reproducing the native architecture is the first step toward matching autograph efficacy. Furthermore, this design can be combined with other biochemical cues to promote nerve regeneration.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-08-16", "authors": ["Eric MJeffries", "YadongWang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/3/035015"}
{"title": "High precision anatomy for MEG.", "abstract": "Precise MEG estimates of neuronal current flow are undermined by uncertain knowledge of the head location with respect to the MEG sensors. This is either due to head movements within the scanning session or systematic errors in co-registration to anatomy. Here we show how such errors can be minimized using subject-specific head-casts produced using 3D printing technology. The casts fit the scalp of the subject internally and the inside of the MEG dewar externally, reducing within session and between session head movements. Systematic errors in matching to MRI coordinate system are also reduced through the use of MRI-visible fiducial markers placed on the same cast. Bootstrap estimates of absolute co-registration error were of the order of 1mm. Estimates of relative co-registration error were <1.5mm between sessions. We corroborated these scalp based estimates by looking at the MEG data recorded over a 6month period. We found that the between session sensor variability of the subject's evoked response was of the order of the within session noise, showing no appreciable noise due to between-session movement. Simulations suggest that the between-session sensor level amplitude SNR improved by a factor of 5 over conventional strategies. We show that at this level of coregistration accuracy there is strong evidence for anatomical models based on the individual rather than canonical anatomy; but that this advantage disappears for errors of greater than 5mm. This work paves the way for source reconstruction methods which can exploit very high SNR signals and accurate anatomical models; and also significantly increases the sensitivity of longitudinal studies with MEG.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2013-08-06", "authors": ["LuziaTroebinger", "Jos\u00e9 DavidL\u00f3pez", "AntoineLutti", "DavidBradbury", "SvenBestmann", "GarethBarnes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.07.065"}
{"title": "Hierarchical tailoring of strut architecture to control permeability of additive manufactured titanium implants.", "abstract": "Porous titanium implants are a common choice for bone augmentation. Implants for spinal fusion and repair of non-union fractures must encourage blood flow after implantation so that there is sufficient cell migration, nutrient and growth factor transport to stimulate bone ingrowth. Additive manufacturing techniques allow a large number of pore network designs. This study investigates how the design factors offered by selective laser melting technique can be used to alter the implant architecture on multiple length scales to control and even tailor the flow. Permeability is a convenient parameter that characterises flow, correlating to structure openness (interconnectivity and pore window size), tortuosity and hence flow shear rates. Using experimentally validated computational simulations, we demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be used to tailor implant properties by controlling surface roughness at a microstructual level (microns), and by altering the strut ordering and density at a mesoscopic level (millimetre).", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

These cell clusters may be non-homogeneously distributed on a flat surface and show irregular beating which can be recorded by calcium ion imaging. In order to improve the cell cluster homogeneity and the beating regularity, patterned topographic features were used to guide the cellular growth and the cell layer formation. On the substrate with an array of broadly spaced cross features made of photoresist, cells grew on the places that were not occupied by the crosses and thus formed a cell layer with interconnected cell clusters. Accordingly, spatially coordinated regular beating could be recorded over the whole patterned area. In contrast, when cultured on the substrate with broadly spaced but inter-connected cross features, the cardiac cell layer showed beatings which were neither coordinated in space nor regular in time. Finally, when cultured on the substrate with narrowly spaced features, the cell beating became spatially coordinated but still remained irregular.

Successful clinical cases of AM are recognized to rely heavily on efficient collaboration between various disciplines - notably operating surgeons, radiologists, and engineers.

We report here the design, construction, and validation of a flexible, scaled, physical model of the polypeptide chain, which accurately reproduces the bond rotational degrees of freedom in the peptide backbone. The coarse-grained backbone model consists of repeating amide and \u03b1-carbon units, connected by mechanical bonds (corresponding to \u03d5 and \u03c8) that include realistic barriers to rotation that closely approximate those found at the molecular scale. Longer-range hydrogen-bonding interactions are also incorporated, allowing the chain to readily fold into stable secondary structures. The model is easily constructed with readily obtainable parts and promises to be a tremendous educational aid to the intuitive understanding of chain folding as the basis for macromolecular structure.

{"title": "Printing thermoresponsive reverse molds for the creation of patterned two-component hydrogels for 3D cell culture.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is an emerging technology that has its origins in the rapid prototyping industry. The different printing processes can be divided into contact bioprinting(1-4) (extrusion, dip pen and soft lithography), contactless bioprinting(5-7) (laser forward transfer, ink-jet deposition) and laser based techniques such as two photon photopolymerization(8). It can be used for many applications such as tissue engineering(9-13), biosensor microfabrication(14-16) and as a tool to answer basic biological questions such as influences of co-culturing of different cell types(17). Unlike common photolithographic or soft-lithographic methods, extrusion bioprinting has the advantage that it does not require a separate mask or stamp. Using CAD software, the design of the structure can quickly be changed and adjusted according to the requirements of the operator. This makes bioprinting more flexible than lithography-based approaches. Here we demonstrate the printing of a sacrificial mold to create a multi-material 3D structure using an array of pillars within a hydrogel as an example. These pillars could represent hollow structures for a vascular network or the tubes within a nerve guide conduit. The material chosen for the sacrificial mold was poloxamer 407, a thermoresponsive polymer with excellent printing properties which is liquid at 4 \u00b0C and a solid above its gelation temperature ~20 \u00b0C for 24.5% w/v solutions(18). This property allows the poloxamer-based sacrificial mold to be eluted on demand and has advantages over the slow dissolution of a solid material especially for narrow geometries. Poloxamer was printed on microscope glass slides to create the sacrificial mold. Agarose was pipetted into the mold and cooled until gelation. After elution of the poloxamer in ice cold water, the voids in the agarose mold were filled with alginate methacrylate spiked with FITC labeled fibrinogen.

In this study, a new design approach was proposed to solve this problem. Specifically, the design of the printed scaffolds consisted of a cage with windows large enough to enable depowdering while still trapping loose fillers placed inside the cage. To demonstrate the potential of this new approach, two filler geometries were used: sandglass and cheese segment. The distance between the fillers was varied and they were either glued to the cage or free to move after successful depowdering. Depowdering efficiency was quantified by microstructural morphometry. The results showed that the use of mobile fillers significantly improved depowdering.

Herein, we describe the construction of a novel immunocompetent 3D human skin model comprising of dendritic cells co-cultured with keratinocytes and fibroblasts. This model culture system is simple to assemble with readily-available components and importantly, can be separated into its constitutive individual layers to allow further insight into cell-cell interactions and detailed studies of the mechanisms of skin sensitization.

We have characterized this model using a combination of confocal microscopy, immuno-histochemistry and scanning electron microscopy and have shown differentiation of the epidermal layer and formation of an epidermal barrier. Crucially the immune cells in the model are able to migrate and remain responsive to stimulation with skin sensitizers even at low concentrations.

The production of a scan prosthesis and multiple preoperative consultations of the patient were unnecessary.\nThe presented procedure offers another step in facilitating the production of drilling guides in dental implantology. Four main advantages are realized with this procedure. First, no additional scan prosthesis is needed. Second, data acquisition can be performed during the first consultation. Third, the virtual planning is directly transferred to the drilling guide without a loss of accuracy. Finally, the treatment cost and time required are reduced with this facilitated production process.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["Tabea ViktoriaFl\u00fcgge", "KatjaNelson", "RainerSchmelzeisen", "Marc ChristianMetzger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2013.04.010"}

Crosslinking of electrospun fibers of natural polymers is needed to prevent dissolution in water and to enhance mechanical strength. In this study, an in situ UV-crosslinking method was developed for crosslinking of gelatin electrospun fibers (GESFs) and water-soluble synthetic polymers. A mixture of gelatin and phenylazide-conjugated poly(acrylic acids) was electrospun under UV irradiation. The UV-crosslinked GESFs were not dissolved in water with improved mechanical strength. Compared to traditional crosslinking by glutaraldehyde vapor, the GESFs crosslinked by our method are superior in terms of retention of GESF morphology, uniform crosslinking throughout the fibers, low cytotoxic and retention of biofunctionality. L929 cells grew better on the UV-crosslinked GESF scaffolds compared to glutaraldehyde-crosslinked ones. Furthermore, bioactive nanoparticles, e.g. hydroxyapatite, could be incorporated into GESFs for enhancing osteoconductivity, which possess a great potential in bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-07-11", "authors": ["Wei-HanLin", "Wei-BorTsai"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/3/035008"}

Using a 4.7 T scanner and a manganese-based contrast agent, we improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the SSC relating to the surrounding anatomical structures allowing to obtain high-contrast 3D images of the SSC. In the last few years, the large development in resin melting techniques opened the way for printing 3D objects starting from a 3D stack of images. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of the 3D printing technique of soft tissues such as the SSC in the rat with the aim to improve the visualization of the organs. This approach is useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth, excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated. To increase the visibility of the details, it is possible to print the organs with a selected zoom factor, useful as in case of tiny organs in small mammalia.

{"title": "Bio-ink properties and printability for extrusion printing living cells.", "abstract": "Additive biofabrication (3D bioprinting) makes it possible to create scaffolds with precise geometries, control over pore interconnectivity and architectures that are not possible with conventional techniques. Inclusion of cells within the ink to form a \"bio-ink\" presents the potential to print 3D structures that can be implanted into damaged/diseased tissue to promote highly controlled cell-based regeneration and repair. The properties of an 'ink' are defined by its formulation and critically influence the delivery and integrity of structure formed. Importantly, the ink properties need to conform to biological requirements necessary for the cell system that they are intended to support and it is often challenging to find conditions for printing that facilitate this critical aspect of tissue bioengineering. In this study, alginate (Alg) was selected as the major component of the 'bio-ink' formulations for extrusion printing of cells. The rheological properties of alginate-gelatin (Alg-Gel) blends were compared with pre-crosslinked alginate and alginate solution to establish their printability whilst maintaining their ability to support optimal cell growth. Pre-crosslinked alginate on its own was liquid-like during printing. However, by controlling the temperature, Alg-Gel formulations had higher viscosity, storage modulus and consistency which facilitated higher print resolution/precision. Compression and indentation testing were used to examine the mechanical properties of alginate compared to Alg-Gel. Both types of gels yielded similar results with modulus increasing with alginate concentration. Decay in mechanical properties over time suggests that Alg-Gel slowly degrades in cell culture media with more than 60% decrease in initial modulus over 7 days. The viability of primary myoblasts delivered as a myoblast/Alg-Gel bio-ink was not affected by the printing process, indicating that the Alg-Gel matrix provides a potential means to print 3D constructs that may find application in myoregenerative applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2013-07-04", "authors": ["Johnson H YChung", "SinaNaficy", "ZhilianYue", "RobertKapsa", "AnitaQuigley", "Simon EMoulton", "Gordon GWallace"], "doi": "10.1039/c3bm00012e"}

However, the control over shape and composition of biofabricated constructs is still a challenge and needs to be improved. The current research aims to improve shape, by converging a number of biocompatible, quality construction materials into a single three-dimensional fiber deposition process. To demonstrate this, several models of complex anatomically shaped constructs were fabricated by combined deposition of poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(\u03b5-caprolactone), gelatin methacrylamide/gellan gum and alginate hydrogel. Sacrificial components were co-deposited as temporary support for overhang geometries and were removed after fabrication by immersion in aqueous solutions. Embedding of chondrocytes in the gelatin methacrylamide/gellan component demonstrated that the fabrication and the sacrificing procedure did not affect cell viability. Further, it was shown that anatomically shaped constructs can be successfully fabricated, yielding advanced porous thermoplastic polymer scaffolds, layered porous hydrogel constructs, as well as reinforced cell-laden hydrogel structures. In conclusion, anatomically shaped tissue constructs of clinically relevant sizes can be generated when employing multiple building and sacrificial materials in a single biofabrication session.

There is a critical need for orthopedic implants that promote rapid osseointegration and prevent bacterial colonization, particularly when placed in bone compromised by disease or physiology of the patients. The aim of this study was to fabricate a novel coaxial electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) core-sheath nanofiber (NF) blended with both hydroxyapatite nanorods (HA) and type I collagen (Col) (PCL(Col)/PVA(HA)). Doxycycline (Doxy) and dexamethasone (Dex) were successfully incorporated into the PCL(Col)/PVA(HA) NFs for controlled release. The morphology, surface hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of the PCL/PVA NF mats were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, water contact angle and atomic force microscopy. The PCL(Col)/PVA(HA) NFs are biocompatible and enhance the adhesion and proliferation of murine pre-osteoblastic MC3T3 cells. The release of Doxy and Dex from coaxial PCL(Col)/PVA(HA) NFs showed more controlled release compared with the blended NFs. Using an ex vivo porcine bone implantation model we found that the PCL(Col)/PVA(HA) NFs bind firmly on the titanium rod surface and the NFs coating remained intact on the surface of titanium rods after pullout. No disruption or delamination was observed after the pullout test.

In this silica-based matrix the cells synthesized hydroxyapatite crystallites after exposure to a mineralization activation cocktail composed of \u03b2-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid and dexamethasone. The degree of hydroxyapatite synthesis, determined by staining the cells with the OsteoImage dye, strongly increased after exposure of the cells to silica. In a previous study we reported that ortho-silicate induces the expression of the gene encoding BMP-2 [bone morphogenetic protein-2].

Those expression values were correlated with the transcript levels of RUNX2 [Runt-related transcription factor 2]. The data show that the steady-state transcript level of RUNX2 remained unchanged in the presence of silica, while this inorganic polymer caused an elevated BMP-2 transcript level, and simultaneously also a significant upregulation of the COLI, COLV, OPN and ON genes.

One of the major challenges is inclusion of blood-vessellike channels between layers to support cell viability, postprinting functionality in terms of nutrient transport, and waste removal. In this research, we developed a novel and effective method to print tubular channels encapsulating cells in alginate to mimic the natural vascular system. An experimental investigation into the influence on cartilage progenitor cell (CPCs) survival, and the function of printing parameters during and after the printing process were presented. CPC functionality was evaluated by checking tissue-specific genetic marker expression and extracellular matrix production. Our results demonstrated the capability of direct fabrication of cell-laden tubular channels by our newly designed coaxial nozzle assembly and revealed that the bioprinting process could induce quantifiable cell death due to changes in dispensing pressure, coaxial nozzle geometry, and biomaterial concentration. Cells were able to recover during incubation, as well as to undergo differentiation with high-level cartilage-associated gene expression.

In order to explore the effects of hybrid structures (combination of micro- and nanofeatures on a pattern) on cell adhesion and alignment, a micro-featured mold was firstly prepared using partial UV-irradiation and the protruding top of the mold was then imprinted with nano-featured templates via successive UV irradiation. An oxygen inhibition effect was utilized in the course of UV curing and a two-step molding process, to form multiscale hybrid structures. The poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) replica of the hybrid mold was manufactured and employed to fabricate hybrid polymeric patterns for cell attachment. The underlying micro-feature was chosen to be a 25-\u00b5m-wide pattern and the nanostructures on the protrusions of the micropattern were different ruled nanogrooves, either parallel or perpendicular to the micro-featured pattern.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing, commonly used for producing design prototypes in industry, allows for one step production of devices. 3D printers build a device layer by layer based on 3D computer models. Here, a reusable, high throughput, 3D printed fluidic device was created that enables flow and incorporates a membrane above a channel in order to study drug transport and affect cells. The device contains 8 parallel channels, 3 mm wide by 1.5 mm deep, connected to a syringe pump through standard, threaded fittings. The device was also printed to allow integration with commercially available membrane inserts whose bottoms are constructed of a porous polycarbonate membrane; this insert enables molecular transport to occur from the channel to above the well. When concentrations of various antibiotics (levofloxacin and linezolid) are pumped through the channels, approximately 18-21% of the drug migrates through the porous membrane, providing evidence that this device will be useful for studies where drug effects on cells are investigated.

The ability to engineer biomimetic constructs mimicking these 3D microarchitectures is subject to the control over cell distribution and organization. In the present study we introduce a novel protocol to generate 3D cell laden hydrogel micropatterns with defined size and shape. The method, named photo-mold patterning (PMP), combines hydrogel micromolding within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps and photopolymerization through a recently introduced biocompatible ultraviolet (UVA) activated photoinitiator (VA-086). Exploiting PDMS micromolds as geometrical constraints for two methacrylated prepolymers (polyethylene glycol diacrylate and gelatin methacrylate), micrometrically resolved structures were obtained within a 3 min exposure to a low cost and commercially available UVA LED. The PMP was validated both on a continuous cell line (human umbilical vein endothelial cells expressing green fluorescent protein, HUVEC GFP) and on primary human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). HUVEC GFP and BMSCs were exposed to 1.5% w/v VA-086 and UVA light (1 W, 385 nm, distance from sample = 5 cm). Photocrosslinking conditions applied during the PMP did not negatively affect cells viability or specific metabolic activity. Quantitative analyses demonstrated the potentiality of PMP to uniformly embed viable cells within 3D microgels, creating biocompatible and favorable environments for cell proliferation and spreading during a seven days' culture. PMP can thus be considered as a promising and cost effective tool for designing spatially accurate in vitro models and, in perspective, functional constructs.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-05-21", "authors": ["POcchetta", "NSadr", "FPiraino", "ARedaelli", "MMoretti", "MRasponi"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/3/035002"}
{"title": "Magnetic-directed patterning of cell spheroids.", "abstract": "We have described an approach to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) cell-based structures using functionalized super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as patterning agents to guide the assembly of endothelial cell spheroids into 3D patterns using the magnetic forces generated by a prefabricated magnetic template. SPIONs were first uptaken by endothelial cells before they were assembled into uniform-sized spheroids through a home-made robotic spheroid maker. To guide the magnetic spheroids, a unique magnetic template was fabricated using computer-aided design and cut from a magnetic sheet. The spheroids were then guided to the prefabricated magnetic template through the attractive magnetic forces between the SPIONs inside the endothelial cells and the magnetic template. Fusion of endothelial cell spheroids over time while adhered to the magnetic template allowed for the formation of 3D cell-based structures. Subsequent removal of the prefabricated magnetic template left 3-D endothelial cell sheets, which may be stacked to fabricate complicated 3D multicellular tissue structures. To enhance the cytocompatibility, SPIONs were silica-coated before use. At low concentrations, the SPIONs did not adversely affect cell viability, proliferation, and phenotype stability. Light and confocal microscopy showed that endothelial cell spheroids could be reproducibly created with high uniformity. The endothelial cells were able to remain viable and maintain the 3D structure in vitro. We have proved the concept to use SPIONs as a patterning agent to direct the attachment and self assembly of SPION-loaded endothelial cell spheroids on a prefabricated magnetic template for the formation of 3D cell based structures. A magnetic-directed technique allows quick patterning of cell spheroids in accordance with desirable magnetic patterns, therefore, holding promise for scalable fabrication of complicated 3D multicellular tissue structures.

This study investigated these effects in subjects with normal and pronated foot types.

{"title": "Microarrays of phospholipid bilayers generated by inkjet printing.", "abstract": "We report an efficient and reproducible method to generate a microarray of model biological membranes on a solid substrate by applying the inkjet printing technology. Although inkjet printing is currently widely used for industrial fabrication processes, including biological materials, printing lipid membranes remains technically challenging due to the hydrophobic nature of droplets and instability of the lipid bilayer structure against dehydration. In the present study, we printed lipids onto a glass substrate covered with a micropatterned membrane of a polymeric phospholipid bilayer. Polymeric bilayers were formed by the lithographic photopolymerization of a diacetylene-containing phospholipid, 1,2-bis(10,12-tricosadiynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DiynePC). After removal of nonpolymerized DiynePC with a detergent solution, natural lipid membranes were incorporated into the polymer-free regions (corrals) by using an electric-field-based inkjet printing device that can eject subfemtoliter volume droplets. To avoid rapid dehydration and destabilization, we preprinted an aqueous solution containing agarose and trehalose onto the corrals and subsequently printed lipid suspensions (\"two-step-printing method\"). After rinsing, stable lipid bilayer membranes were formed in the corrals. The bilayers were continuous and fluid as confirmed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We could introduce multiple bilayer patches having different lipid compositions into the neighboring corrals. The present results demonstrate that the combination of a patterned polymeric bilayer and inkjet printing technology enables efficient, reliable, and scalable generation of the model membrane microarrays having varied compositions.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2013-05-01", "authors": ["MisatoYamada", "HiromasaImaishi", "KenichiMorigaki"], "doi": "10.1021/la400570h"}

In this wet \u00b5CP, a liquid solution containing drug molecules (methylene blue and tetracycline HCl) dissolved in a carrier solvent was transferred to a target surface (drug reservoir) by contact printing process. In particular, we have investigated the dependence of the quantity and morphology of transferred drug molecules on the stamp size, concentration, printing times, solvent types and surfactant concentration. It was also found that the repetition of printing using a non-volatile solvent such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a drug carrier material actually increased the transferred amount of drug molecules in proportion to the printing times based on asymmetric liquid bridge formation.

Initially, the scaffold surface properties were characterized through contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy to evaluate appropriate hydrophobicity and orientation of molecular chains for 3D culture. The template surfaces exhibited higher hydrophobicity, in the range of 70-75\u00b0, than usual cellulose films and appeared suitable for surface cell adhesion. In fact, epidermal cells successfully attached and proliferated favorably on the NOC templates, similar to development in normal culture flasks. Furthermore, the NOC film, as a semipermeable template, was also employed to allow 3D proliferation of epidermal cell layers in the perpendicular direction. The template proved to be suitable as a 3D cell culture device, resulting in the proposal that the construction processes of these 3D cell layers followed the basic concept of skin formation.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-04-30", "authors": ["TomokoSeyama", "Eun YoungSuh", "TetsuoKondo"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/2/025010"}

{"title": "Mechanical evaluation of bacterial nanocellulose as an implant material for ear cartilage replacement.", "abstract": "Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is a novel non-degradable biocompatible material that promotes chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation. In this work, its potential use in ear cartilage tissue engineering (TE) is investigated. Firstly, the mechanical properties of native ear cartilage are measured in order to set a preliminary benchmark for ear cartilage replacement materials. Secondly, the capacity of BNC to match these requirements is assessed. Finally, a biofabrication process to produce patient-specific BNC auricular implants is demonstrated. BNC samples (n=78) with varying cellulose content (2.5-15%) were compared using stress-relaxation indentation with human ear cartilage (n=17, from 4 males, aged 49-93 years old). Additionally, an auricle from a volunteer was scanned using a 3T MRI with a spoiled gradient-echo sequence. A negative ear mold was produced from the MRI data in order to investigate if an ear-shaped BNC prototype could be produced from this mold. The results show that the instantaneous modulus Ein, equilibrium modulus Eeq, and maximum stress \u03c3max of the BNC samples are correlated to effective cellulose content. Despite significantly different relaxation kinetics, the Ein, Eeq and \u03c3max of BNC at 14% effective cellulose content reached values equivalent to ear cartilage (for Eeq, BNC: 2.4\u00b10.4MPa and ear cartilage: 3.3\u00b11.3MPa). Additionally, this work shows that BNC can be fabricated into patient-specific auricular shapes.

Small-sized sintered TCP scaffolds (10 mm diameter, 21 mm length) were fabricated as dense and open-porous samples and tested in an axial loading procedure. Material properties for titanium alloy were determined by using both tensile (dense) and compressive test samples (open-porous).

We studied whether TiO2\u00a0coating on plastic cell culture dishes could promote proliferation of hMSCs without adverse effects in chondrogenic differentiation. TiO2-films were deposited on polystyrene dishes and glass coverslips using an ultrashort pulsed laser deposition technique. Human MSCs from three donors were expanded on them until 95% confluence, and the cells were evaluated by morphology, immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The chondrogenic differentiation in pellets was performed after cultivation on TiO2-coated dishes. Chondrogenesis was evaluated by histological staining of proteoglycans and type II collagen, and qRT-PCR. Human MSC-associated markers STRO-1, CD44, CD90 and CD146 did not change after expansion on TiO2-coated coverslips. However, the cell number after a 48h-culture period was significantly higher on TiO2-coated culture dishes. Importantly, TiO2\u00a0coating caused no significant differences in the proteoglycan and type II collagen staining of the pellets, or the expression of chondrocyte-specific genes in the chondrogenesis assay.

Both polymers have recently been described as a template that induces an increased expression of the genes encoding bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and osteoprotegerin in osteoblast-related SaOS-2 cells; simultaneously or subsequently the cells respond with enhanced hydroxyapatite formation. In order to assess whether the biocompatible polymeric silica/biosilica can serve as a morphogenetically active matrix suitable for three-dimensional (3D) cell growth, or even for 3D cell bioprinting, SaOS-2 cells were embedded into a Na-alginate-based hydrogel. Four different gelatinous hydrogel matrices were used for suspending SaOS-2 cells: (a) the hydrogel alone; (b) the hydrogel with 400 \u03bcM ortho-silicate; (c) the hydrogel supplemented with 400 \u03bcM ortho-silicate and recombinant silicatein to allow biosilica synthesis to occur; and (d) the hydrogel with ortho-silicate and BSA. The SaOS-2 cells showed an increased growth if silica/biosilica components were present in the hydrogel. Likewise intensified was the formation of hydroxyapatite nodules in the silica-containing hydrogels. After an incubation period of 2 weeks, cells present in silica-containing hydrogels showed a significantly higher expression of the genes encoding the cytokine BMP-2, the major fibrillar structural protein collagen 1 and likewise of carbonic anhydrase.

Hyaluronan-based hydrogels mixed with fibroblasts (L929), mouse endothelial cells (MS1), or human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were patterned using a 3D moving axis bioprinter and cell behavior was monitored in culture for up to 16 days. L929 and MS1 cells and hMSCs in patterned hydrogel revealed cell-cell interactions and a morphological dependency on cell types. HMSCs formed spheres through cell aggregation, while L929 cells increased in cellular mass without cell aggregation and MS1 dispersed into the matrix instead of aggregating. The aggregation of hMSCs was attenuated by treatment with Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor and cadherin antibody. This reflected the close relationship between cell aggregation and migration with RhoA and cell-cell adhesion molecules. Angiogenic-specific gene expression profiles showed that expression of CD105 decreased to 22% in the ROCK inhibitor group compared to control group. These results showed that cell-based patterns in a 3D matrix are highly dependent on both cell aggregation and migration over time.", "journal": "Journal of bioscience and bioengineering", "date": "2013-04-09", "authors": ["SoyoungHong", "Seung-JoonSong", "Jae YeonLee", "HwanseokJang", "JaesoonChoi", "KyungSun", "YongdooPark"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.02.011"}
{"title": "Advanced biofabrication strategies for skin regeneration and repair.", "abstract": "Skin is the largest organ of human body, acting as a barrier with protective, immunologic and sensorial functions. Its permanent exposure to the external environment can result in different kinds of damage with loss of variable volumes of extracellular matrix. For the treatment of skin lesions, several strategies are currently available, such as the application of autografts, allografts, wound dressings and tissue-engineered substitutes. Although proven clinically effective, these strategies are still characterized by key limitations such as patient morbidity, inadequate vascularization, low adherence to the wound bed, the inability to reproduce skin appendages and high manufacturing costs. Advanced strategies based on both bottom-up and top-down approaches offer an effective, permanent and viable alternative to solve the abovementioned drawbacks by combining biomaterials, cells, growth factors and advanced biomanufacturing techniques.

{"title": "Antibacterial and cytotoxic efficacy of extracellular silver nanoparticles biofabricated from chromium reducing novel OS4 strain of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.", "abstract": "Biofabricated metal nanoparticles are generally biocompatible, inexpensive, and ecofriendly, therefore, are used preferably in industries, medical and material science research. Considering the importance of biofabricated materials, we isolated, characterized and identified a novel bacterial strain OS4 of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (GenBank: JN247637.1). At neutral pH, this Gram negative bacterial strain significantly reduced hexavalent chromium, an important heavy metal contaminant found in the tannery effluents and minings. Subsequently, even at room temperature the supernatant of log phase grown culture of strain OS4 also reduced silver nitrate (AgNO3) to generate nanoparticles (AgNPs). These AgNPs were further characterized by UV-visible, Nanophox particle size analyzer, XRD, SEM and FTIR. As evident from the FTIR data, plausibly the protein components of supernatant caused the reduction of AgNO3. The cuboid and homogenous AgNPs showed a characteristic UV-visible peak at 428 nm with average size of ~93 nm. The XRD spectra exhibited the characteristic Bragg peaks of 111, 200, 220 and 311 facets of the face centred cubic symmetry of nanoparticles suggesting that these nanoparticles were crystalline in nature. From the nanoparticle release kinetics data, the rapid release of AgNPs was correlated with the particle size and increasing surface area of the nanoparticles. A highly significant antimicrobial activity against medically important bacteria by the biofabricated AgNPs was also revealed as decline in growth of Staphylococcus aureus (91%), Escherichia coli (69%) and Serratia marcescens (66%) substantially. Additionally, different cytotoxic assays showed no toxicity of AgNPs to liver function, RBCs, splenocytes and HeLa cells, hence these particles were safe to use. Therefore, this novel bacterial strain OS4 is likely to provide broad spectrum benefits for curing chromium polluted sites, for biofabrication of AgNPs and ultimately in the nanoparticle based drug formulation for the treatment of infectious diseases.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-04-05", "authors": ["MohammadOves", "Mohammad SaghirKhan", "AlmasZaidi", "Arham SAhmed", "FaheemAhmed", "EjazAhmad", "AsifSherwani", "MohammadOwais", "AmeerAzam"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0059140"}
{"title": "Enhanced osteogenic fate and function of MC3T3-E1 cells on nanoengineered polystyrene surfaces with nanopillar and nanopore arrays.", "abstract": "During in vitro culture, cell fate and function, including cell adhesion, morphology, proliferation and differentiation, are affected by surface characteristics, such as geometry, wettability, hardness, chemistry and charge. This study replicated two different types of nanoengineered polystyrene surfaces (NPS) containing nanopillar (NPS-Pi) or nanopore (NPS-Po) arrays by hot embossing and investigated their topographical effects on cell behavior using osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. To mass-replicate NPS, rigid metal nano-stamps were manufactured by nickel electroforming onto two different nano-templates: (1) a nanopore-arrayed anodic aluminum oxide nano-template using two-step electrochemical oxidation and (2) a nanopillar-arrayed polymer using hot embossing process. The physical and mechanical properties of the NPS, including geometry, wettability, hardness and elastic modulus, were evaluated with the help of field emission-scanning electron microscopy, a contact angle meter, and a nanoindenter. The nanotopography maintained the bulk property, while drastically changing the surface properties. In vitro the NPS had significant effects on MC3T3-E1 cell morphology, attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation compared to a flat substrate due to the altered physical and mechanical surface properties of the nanoengineered surface. Interestingly, the NPS-Po was more effective at enhancing cell proliferation and osteogenesis differentiation. One potential explanation for these results may be that the subcellular binding sites induced by the nanostructures changed the cell morphology and promoted contractile cytoskeletons, thereby enhancing osteogenic differentiation. This, which allows for the cost-effective replication of NPS and the control of cell behavior, has various applications with respect to biomedical and cell surface interaction studies, in addition to enhanced osteogenic cell fate and function.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-04-04", "authors": ["Kyoung JeCha", "Jung MinHong", "Dong-WooCho", "Dong SungKim"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/2/025007"}
{"title": "3D printing of preclinical X-ray computed tomographic data sets.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing allows for the production of highly detailed objects through a process known as additive manufacturing. Traditional, mold-injection methods to create models or parts have several limitations, the most important of which is a difficulty in making highly complex products in a timely, cost-effective manner.(1) However, gradual improvements in three-dimensional printing technology have resulted in both high-end and economy instruments that are now available for the facile production of customized models.(2) These printers have the ability to extrude high-resolution objects with enough detail to accurately represent in vivo images generated from a preclinical X-ray CT scanner. With proper data collection, surface rendering, and stereolithographic editing, it is now possible and inexpensive to rapidly produce detailed skeletal and soft tissue structures from X-ray CT data. Even in the early stages of development, the anatomical models produced by three-dimensional printing appeal to both educators and researchers who can utilize the technology to improve visualization proficiency. (3, 4) The real benefits of this method result from the tangible experience a researcher can have with data that cannot be adequately conveyed through a computer screen. The translation of pre-clinical 3D data to a physical object that is an exact copy of the test subject is a powerful tool for visualization and communication, especially for relating imaging research to students, or those in other fields.

{"title": "The deep-sea natural products, biogenic polyphosphate (Bio-PolyP) and biogenic silica (Bio-Silica), as biomimetic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering: fabrication of a morphogenetically-active polymer.", "abstract": "Bone defects in human, caused by fractures/nonunions or trauma, gain increasing impact and have become a medical challenge in the present-day aging population. Frequently, those fractures require surgical intervention which ideally relies on autografts or suboptimally on allografts. Therefore, it is pressing and likewise challenging to develop bone substitution materials to heal bone defects. During the differentiation of osteoblasts from their mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells and of osteoclasts from their hemopoietic precursor cells, a lineage-specific release of growth factors and a trans-lineage homeostatic cross-talk via signaling molecules take place. Hence, the major hurdle is to fabricate a template that is functioning in a way mimicking the morphogenetic, inductive role(s) of the native extracellular matrix. In the last few years, two naturally occurring polymers that are produced by deep-sea sponges, the biogenic polyphosphate (bio-polyP) and biogenic silica (bio-silica) have also been identified as promoting morphogenetic on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These polymers elicit cytokines that affect bone mineralization (hydroxyapatite formation). In this manner, bio-silica and bio-polyP cause an increased release of BMP-2, the key mediator activating the anabolic arm of the hydroxyapatite forming cells, and of RANKL. In addition, bio-polyP inhibits the progression of the pre-osteoclasts to functionally active osteoclasts. Based on these findings, new bioinspired strategies for the fabrication of bone biomimetic templates have been developed applying 3D-printing techniques. Finally, a strategy is outlined by which these two morphogenetically active polymers might be used to develop a novel functionally active polymer.", "journal": "Marine drugs", "date": "2013-03-27", "authors": ["XiaohongWang", "Heinz CSchr\u00f6der", "QinglingFeng", "FlorianDraenert", "Werner E GM\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.3390/md11030718\n10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.003\n10.1007/s005860100282\n10.1016/j.copbio.2012.01.018\n10.1016/j.procbio.2011.10.028\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.083007.093039\n10.1142/S0218957797000049\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.097\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010035\n10.1007/s00774-008-0018-6\n10.1182/blood-2010-05-282855\n10.1021/cr0782527\n10.1016/0003-9861(58)90438-7\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.396-398.209\n10.1016/0308-8146(86)90159-7\n10.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.001315\n10.1177/0022034510363096\n10.1073/pnas.0508480102\n10.1177/154405910708600917\n10.1006/abio.1994.1015\n10.1016/S0304-4165(96)00121-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.002\n10.1007/s00223-010-9408-6\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.03.007\n10.1093/rheumatology/40.10.1163\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80209-3\n10.1002/jor.1100180326\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.060834\n10.1007/BF02411229\n10.1002/term.1465\n10.1177/002215540405200312\n10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00695-8\n10.1007/s00253-009-2014-8\n10.1016/j.abb.2008.03.027\n10.1021/j150527a014\n10.1073/pnas.95.11.6234\n10.1890/070126\n10.1385/BTER:77:1:25\n10.1007/s00018-007-7104-0\n10.1210/er.20.3.345\n10.1016/j.molmed.2004.12.004\n10.1074/jbc.M109.016915\n10.1016/S0074-7696(04)35002-3\n10.1002/jbm.b.30322\n10.1002/jcb.24196\n10.1002/adem.200980043\n10.1006/jsre.2001.6128\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00619-7\n10.1023/B:BILE.0000032962.79531.fd\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.01.014\n10.1002/jbm.a.30479\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.503433\n10.1042/BA20050075\n10.1243/09544119JEIM770\n10.1016/S0142-9612(97)00146-4\n10.1016/j.msea.2006.09.051\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00343-0\n10.1902/jop.2005.76.10.1743\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68891-0\n10.1186/ar2656\n10.1007/s11095-010-0099-5\n10.1016/j.bone.2010.08.008\n10.1038/nature01658\n10.1034/j.1600-0765.2003.02006.x\n10.1016/j.abb.2008.03.018\n10.1016/j.abb.2009.04.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012837\n10.1096/fj.08-122598\n10.1136/jcp.2010.086595\n10.1083/jcb.54.3.626\n10.1146/annurev.matsci.28.1.271\n10.1126/science.1116994\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.009\n10.1098/rsif.2008.0419.focus\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.04.022\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.04.021\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.1197\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.01.011\n10.1002/jbm.b.30291\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.012\n10.1016/j.dental.2011.09.010\n10.1021/bm901260y\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08531.x\n10.1074/jbc.M112.351486\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.021"}

{"title": "Tissue engineered skin substitutes created by laser-assisted bioprinting form skin-like structures in the dorsal skin fold chamber in mice.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering plays an important role in the production of skin equivalents for the therapy of chronic and especially burn wounds. Actually, there exists no (cellularized) skin equivalent which might be able to satisfactorily mimic native skin. Here, we utilized a laser-assisted bioprinting (LaBP) technique to create a fully cellularized skin substitute. The unique feature of LaBP is the possibility to position different cell types in an exact three-dimensional (3D) spatial pattern. For the creation of the skin substitutes, we positioned fibroblasts and keratinocytes on top of a stabilizing matrix (Matriderm\u00ae). These skin constructs were subsequently tested in vivo, employing the dorsal skin fold chamber in nude mice. The transplants were placed into full-thickness skin wounds and were fully connected to the surrounding tissue when explanted after 11 days. The printed keratinocytes formed a multi-layered epidermis with beginning differentiation and stratum corneum. Proliferation of the keratinocytes was mainly detected in the suprabasal layers. In vitro controls, which were cultivated at the air-liquid-interface, also exhibited proliferative cells, but they were rather located in the whole epidermis. E-cadherin as a hint for adherens junctions and therefore tissue formation could be found in the epidermis in vivo as well as in vitro. In both conditions, the printed fibroblasts partly stayed on top of the underlying Matriderm\u00ae where they produced collagen, while part of them migrated into the Matriderm\u00ae. In the mice, some blood vessels could be found to grow from the wound bed and the wound edges in direction of the printed cells. In conclusion, we could show the successful 3D printing of a cell construct via LaBP and the subsequent tissue formation in vivo.

Although the current methods of cell encapsulation in hydrogels can distribute them in three dimensions, these methods typically lack spatial control of multi-cellular organization and do not allow for the possibility of cell-cell contacts as seen for the native tissue. Here, we report the integration of dielectrophoresis (DEP) with stereolithography (SL) apparatus for the spatial patterning of cells on custom made gold micro-electrodes. Afterwards, they are encapsulated in poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels of different stiffnesses.

The fracture toughness of the scaffold prepared with the mixture powder containing 1\u00a0wt% PLLA increases by 18.18% and the compressive strength increases by 4.45% compared to the scaffold prepared from the \u03b2-TCP powder. The strengthening and toughening is related to the enhancement of \u03b2-TCP sintering characteristics via introducing a transient liquid phase in SLS. Moreover, the microcracks caused by the volume expansion due to the \u03b2-\u03b1 phase transformation of TCP are reduced because of the PLLA inhibition function on the phase transformation. However, PLLA additive above 1\u00a0wt% would lead to a PLLA residue which will decrease the mechanical properties.

However, building three-dimensional (3D) vascularized organs remains the main technological barrier to be overcome. One of the major challenges is the inclusion of a vascular network to support cell viability in terms of nutrients and oxygen perfusion. This paper introduces a new approach to the fabrication of vessel-like microfluidic channels that has the potential to be used in thick tissue or organ fabrication in the future. In this research, we investigate the manufacturability of printable micro-fluidic channels, where micro-fluidic channels support mechanical integrity as well as enable fluid transport in 3D. A pressure-assisted solid freeform fabrication platform is developed with a coaxial needle dispenser unit to print hollow hydrogel filaments. The dispensing rheology is studied, and effects of material properties on structural formation of hollow filaments are analyzed. Sample structures are printed through the developed computer-controlled system. In addition, cell viability and gene expression studies are presented in this paper. Cell viability shows that cartilage progenitor cells (CPCs) maintained their viability right after bioprinting and during prolonged in vitro culture. Real-time PCR analysis yielded a relatively higher expression of cartilage-specific genes in alginate hollow filament encapsulating CPCs, compared with monolayer cultured CPCs, which revealed that printable semi-permeable micro-fluidic channels provided an ideal environment for cell growth and function.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-03-06", "authors": ["YahuiZhang", "YinYu", "HowardChen", "Ibrahim TOzbolat"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/2/025004"}

The weight ratio of HA added to the synthesized biopolymer was 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1. The experimental results show that the maximum average compressive strength of biocomposite scaffolds, made of weight ratio 0.5, with mean pore size of 410 \u03bcm (porosity 81%) is 18.38 MPa which is two times stronger than that of biopolymer scaffolds. Osteoblast cells, MC3T3-E1, were seeded on both types of fabricated scaffolds to validate the biocompatibility using methylthianzol tetrazolium (MTT) assay and cell morphology observation. After 28 days of in vitro culturing, the seeded osteoblasts were well distributed in the interior of both types of scaffolds. Furthermore, MTT experimental results show that the cell viability of the biocomposite scaffold is higher than that of the biopolymer scaffold.

In this study, the ability of adult human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)-derived ECM to rescue the phenotype of osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes and to further stimulate the differentiation of healthy (HL) chondrocytes was evaluated. ECMs were prepared by decellularizing hMSCs cultured in basic medium (BM) and chondrogenic medium (CM). The obtained ECM was then combined with a polymeric solution of Poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) dissolved in 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) and electrospun meshes were fabricated. Electrospun ECM scaffolds were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and picrosirius red staining was used to confirm the presence of collagen. OA and HL chondrocytes were cultured on scaffolds containing hMSC ECM in BM or CM and compared to PCL electrospun scaffolds without ECM. Metabolic activity and chondrogenic gene expression were assessed by Alamar blue assay and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, respectively. The ECM presence resulted in a significant difference in chondrocyte metabolic activity compared to PCL scaffolds alone. HL chondrocytes cultured for 21\u00a0days in chondrogenic medium on electrospun scaffolds containing hMSC ECM from BM showed a significant increase in collagen II and aggrecan expression compared to hMSC ECM from CM and PCL scaffolds without ECM incorporation. No significant influence of hMSC ECM presence on the chondrogenic signature of OA chondrocytes was found.

Customised FOs were administered to participant groups with symptomatic pronated foot types and asymptomatic normal foot types.

A key challenge has been the development of printing processes which are both controllable and less harmful, in order to preserve cell and tissue viability and functions. Here, we report on the development of a valve-based cell printer that has been validated to print highly viable cells in programmable patterns from two different bio-inks with independent control of the volume of each droplet (with a lower limit of 2 nL or fewer than five cells per droplet). Human ESCs were used to make spheroids by overprinting two opposing gradients of bio-ink; one of hESCs in medium and the other of medium alone. The resulting array of uniform sized droplets with a gradient of cell concentrations was inverted to allow cells to aggregate and form spheroids via gravity. The resulting aggregates have controllable and repeatable sizes, and consequently they can be made to order for specific applications. Spheroids with between 5 and 140 dissociated cells resulted in spheroids of 0.25-0.6\u00a0mm diameter. This work demonstrates that the valve-based printing process is gentle enough to maintain stem cell viability, accurate enough to produce spheroids of uniform size, and that printed cells maintain their pluripotency.

{"title": "Staging the self-assembly process: inspiration from biological development.", "abstract": "One of the practical challenges facing the creation of self-assembling systems is being able to exploit a limited set of fixed components and their bonding mechanisms. The method of staging divides the self-assembly process into time intervals, during which components can be added to, or removed from, an environment at each interval. Staging addresses the challenge of using components that lack plasticity by encoding the construction of a target structure in the staging algorithm itself and not exclusively in the design of the components. Previous staging strategies do not consider the interplay between component physical features (morphological information). In this work we use morphological information to stage the self-assembly process, during which components can only be added to their environment at each time interval, to demonstrate our concept. Four experiments are presented, which use heterogeneous, passive, mechanical components that are fabricated using 3D printing. Two orbital shaking environments are used to provide energy to the components and to investigate the role of morphological information with component movement in either two or three spatial dimensions. The benefit of our staging strategy is shown by reducing assembly errors and exploiting bonding mechanisms with rotational properties. As well, a doglike target structure is used to demonstrate in theory how component information used at an earlier time interval can be reused at a later time interval, inspired by the use of a body plan in biological development. We propose that a staged body plan is one method toward scaling self-assembling systems with many interacting components. The experiments and body plan example demonstrate, as proof of concept, that staging enables the self-assembly of more complex morphologies not otherwise possible.", "journal": "Artificial life", "date": "2013-02-05", "authors": ["NavneetBhalla", "Peter JBentley", "Peter DVize", "ChristianJacob"], "doi": "10.1162/ARTL_a_00095"}

Appropriate cell dispensing conditions and optimum alginate concentrations for maintaining cell viability were determined. In vitro cell-based biochemical assays were performed to determine glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), DNA and total collagen contents from different PCL-alginate gel constructs. PCL-alginate gels containing transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) showed higher ECM formation.

This method uses a coaxial double-orifice spinneret, simpler than triple-orifice spinnerets which have been used for preparing similar constructs. The intended application was to create a template for preparing filament-like structures composed of two heterogeneous living cell layers. An aqueous solution containing an alginate derivative possessing phenolic hydroxyl moieties (Alg-Ph), catalase and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was extruded into an ambient flow of H(2)O(2)\u00a0aqueous solution. This operation enabled the Alg-Ph solution to be gellable through a HRP-catalyzed reaction, cross-linking the Ph moieties together.

{"title": "Biofabricated film with enzymatic and redox-capacitor functionalities to harvest and store electrons.", "abstract": "Exciting opportunities in bioelectronics will be facilitated by materials that can bridge the chemical logic of biology and the digital logic of electronics. Here we report the fabrication of a dual functional hydrogel film that can harvest electrons from its chemical environment and store these electrons by switching the film's redox-state. The hydrogel scaffold was formed by the anodic deposition of the aminopolysaccharide chitosan. Electron-harvesting function was conferred by co-depositing the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) with chitosan. GDH catalyzes the transfer of electrons from glucose to the soluble redox-shuttle NADP(+). Electron-storage function was conferred by the redox-active food phenolic chlorogenic acid (CA) that was enzymatically grafted to the chitosan scaffold using tyrosinase. The grafted CA undergoes redox-cycling reactions with NADPH resulting in the net transfer of electrons to the film where they are stored in the reduced state of CA. The individual and dual functionalities of these films were demonstrated experimentally. There are three general conclusions from this proof-of-concept study. First, enzymatically-grafted catecholic moieties confer redox-capacitor function to the chitosan scaffold. Second, biological materials (i.e. chitosan and CA) and mechanisms (i.e. tyrosinase-mediated grafting) allow the reagentless fabrication of functional films that should be environmentally-friendly, safe and potentially even edible. Finally, the film's ability to mediate the transfer of electrons from a biological metabolite to an electrode suggests an approach to bridge the chemical logic of biology with the digital logic of electronics.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-01-11", "authors": ["Benjamin DLiba", "EunkyoungKim", "Alexandra NMartin", "YiLiu", "William EBentley", "Gregory FPayne"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015008"}

In this paper we have studied its role in cell migration through modeling the effect of cell shape on the cell traction force distribution, the traction force dependent stability of cell adhesion and the matrix rigidity dependent traction force formation. To quantify the driving force of cell migration, a new parameter called the motility factor, that takes account of the effect of cell shape, matrix rigidity and dynamic stability of cell adhesion, is proposed. We showed that the motility factor depends on the matrix rigidity in a biphasic manner, which is consistent with the experimental observations of the biphasic dependence of cell migration speed on the matrix rigidity. We showed that the cell shape plays a pivotal role in the cell migration behavior by regulating the traction force at the cell front and rear. The larger the cell polarity, the larger the motility factor is. The keratocyte-like shape has a larger motility factor than the fibroblast-like shape, which explains why keratocyte has a much higher migration speed. The motility factor might be an appropriate parameter for a quantitative description of the driving force of cell migration.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-01-11", "authors": ["YuanZhong", "BaohuaJi"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015011"}

As a new culture substratum, we designed a tissue culture plate that was coated with a composite gel composed of agarose and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). A culture plate coated with agarose only showed no response to NIR irradiation. In contrast, NIR laser irradiation induced heat generation by CNTs; this permitted local solation of the CNT/agarose gel, and consequently, selective cell-adhesive regions were exposed on the tissue culture plate. The solation area was controlled by the NIR intensity, magnification of the object lens and CNT concentration in the gel. Furthermore, we formed circular patterns of HeLa cells and linear patterns of 3T3 cells on the same culture plate through selective and stepwise NIR irradiation of the CNT/agarose gel, and we also demonstrated that individual 3T3 cells migrated along a linear path formed on the CNT/agarose gel by NIR irradiation.

Here we present a study on the preparation and characterization of protein-loaded microspheres, either alone or incorporated into mock tissue scaffolds, for sustained protein delivery. Alginate microspheres were prepared by a novel, small-scale water-in-oil emulsion technique and loaded with fluorescently labeled immunoglobulin G (IgG). Microsphere size appears to be influenced by the magnitude and distribution of force generated by mechanical stirring during emulsion. Protein release studies show that sustained IgG release from microspheres could be achieved and that application of a secondary coating of chitosan could further slow the rate of protein release. Preservation of bioactivity of released IgG protein was confirmed using an immunohistochemical assay. When IgG-loaded microspheres were incorporated into mock scaffolds, initial protein release was diminished and the overall time course of release was extended. The present study demonstrates that protein-loaded microspheres can be prepared with a controlled release profile and preserved biological activity, and can be incorporated into scaffolds to achieve sustained and prolonged protein delivery in a tissue engineering application.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-01-11", "authors": ["PengZhai", "X BChen", "David JSchreyer"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015009"}
{"title": "Rapid additive manufacturing of MR compatible multipinhole collimators with selective laser melting of tungsten powder.", "abstract": "The construction of complex collimators with a high number of oblique pinholes is very labor intensive, expensive or is sometimes impossible with the current available techniques (drilling, milling or electric discharge machining). All these techniques are subtractive: one starts from solid plates and the material at the position of the pinholes is removed. The authors used a novel technique for collimator construction, called metal additive manufacturing. This process starts with a solid piece of tungsten on which a first layer of tungsten powder is melted. Each subsequent layer is then melted on the previous layer. This melting is done by selective laser melting at the locations where the CAD design file defines solid material.\nA complex collimator with 20 loftholes with 500 \u03bcm diameter pinhole opening was designed and produced (16 mm thick and 70 \u00d7 52 mm(2) transverse size). The density was determined, the production accuracy was measured (GOM ATOS II Triple Scan, Nikon AZ100M microscope, Olympus IMT200 microscope). Point source measurements were done by mounting the collimator on a SPECT detector. Because there is increasing interest in dual-modality SPECT-MR imaging, the collimator was also positioned in a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker Pharmascan). A uniform phantom was acquired using T1, T2, and T2* sequences to check for artifacts or distortion of the phantom images due to the collimator presence. Additionally, three tungsten sample pieces (250, 500, and 750 \u03bcm thick) were produced. The density, attenuation (140 keV beam), and uniformity (GE eXplore Locus SP micro-CT) of these samples were measured.\nThe density of the collimator was equal to 17.31 \u00b1 0.10 g\u2215cm(3) (89.92% of pure tungsten). The production accuracy ranges from -260 to +650 \u03bcm. The aperture positions have a mean deviation of 5 \u03bcm, the maximum deviation was 174 \u03bcm and the minimum deviation was -122 \u03bcm. The mean aperture diameter is 464 \u00b1 19 \u03bcm. The calculated and measured sensitivity and resolution of point sources at different positions in the field-of-view agree well. The measured and expected attenuation of the three sample pieces are in a good agreement. There was no influence of the 7T magnetic field on the collimator (which is paramagnetic) and minimal distortion was noticed on the MR scan of the uniform phantom.\nAdditive manufacturing is a very promising technique for the production of complex multipinhole collimators and may also be used for producing other complex collimators. The cost of this technique is only related to the amount of powder needed and the time it takes to have the collimator built. The timeframe from design to collimator production is significantly reduced.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2013-01-10", "authors": ["KarelDeprez", "StefaanVandenberghe", "KarenVan Audenhaege", "JonasVan Vaerenbergh", "RoelVan Holen"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4769122"}

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed a fibre diameter of 5.49 \u00b1 0.96\u00a0\u00b5m for as-spun meshes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements determined an exponential increase of surface roughness with plasma treatment time. An increase in hydrophilicity after plasma treatment was observed, which was associated with higher oxygen content in plasma treated scaffolds compared to untreated ones. A more pronounced adsorption of bovine serum albumin occurred on scaffolds treated with plasma for 15 and 30\u00a0min compared to untreated fibres. Clinically relevant human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were cultured on untreated, 15 and 30\u00a0min treated scaffolds.

No significant differences were observed between different scaffolds regarding the amount of DNA, metabolic activity and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after 7\u00a0days of culture. The amount of ALP positive cells increased between 7 and 21\u00a0days of culture on both untreated and 30\u00a0min treated meshes. In addition, ALP staining of cells on plasma treated meshes appeared more pronounced than on untreated meshes after 21\u00a0days of culture.

{"title": "A bio-inspired platform to modulate myogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells through focal adhesion regulation.", "abstract": "The use of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in cardiac-tissue engineering has gained widespread attention and many reports have shown that matrix compliance, micro/nano-patterns could be some of the important biophysical cues that drive hMSCs differentiation. Regardless of the type of biophysical induction cues, cells mainly explore their environment via focal adhesion (FA) and FA plays an important role in many cellular behaviours. Therefore, it is hypothesized that FA modulation through materials manipulation could be an important cue for modulation that would result in the stem cell lineage commitment. In this work, the FA of hMSCs is modulated by a novel microcontact printing method using polyvinyl alcohol as a trans-print media which can successfully print proteins on soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The FA is successfully modified into dense FA and elongated FA by micropatterning square and rectangular patterns on 12.6 kPa PDMS respectively. Additionally, the combined effects of stiffness of PDMS substrates (hard (308 kPa), intermediate (12.6 kPa)) and FA patterning on hMSCs differentiation are studied. The results indicate that dense FA does not induce myogenesis while elongated FA can promote cytoskeleton alignment and further myogenesis on PDMS with intermediate stiffness of 12.6 kPa. However, on stiff substrate (308 kPa), with or without patterns, the cytoskeleton alignment and myogenesis are not obvious. This demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to induce the differentiation of hMSCs by regulating the FA using a materials platform even in the absence of any biochemical factors. It also shows that there is a synergistic effect between FA regulation and matrix stiffness that results in a more specific and higher up-regulated myogenesis. This platform presents a new chemical/biological-free method to engineer the myogenic differentiation of hMSCs.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["HaiyangYu", "Chor YongTay", "MintuPal", "Wen ShingLeong", "HuaqiongLi", "HaiLi", "FengWen", "David TaiLeong", "Lay PohTan"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201200142"}

Here, we hypothesise that cell-laden hydrogels can be printed when submerged in perfluorotributylamine (C(12)F(27)N), a hydrophobic high-density fluid, and that these cells placed within three-dimensional constructs remain viable allowing for cell proliferation and production of extracellular matrix. Human mesenchymal stem cells and MG-63 cells were encapsulated into agarose hydrogels, and subsequently printed in high aspect ratio in three dimensional structures that were supported in high density fluorocarbon. Three-dimensional structures with various shapes and sizes were manufactured and remained stable for more than six months. Live/dead and DAPI stainings showed viable cells 24\u00a0h after the printing process, as well as after 21\u00a0days in culture.

{"title": "Hybrid printing of mechanically and biologically improved constructs for cartilage tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is an emerging technique used to fabricate viable, 3D tissue constructs through the precise deposition of cells and hydrogels in a layer-by-layer fashion. Despite the ability to mimic the native properties of tissue, printed 3D constructs that are composed of naturally-derived biomaterials still lack structural integrity and adequate mechanical properties for use in vivo, thus limiting their development for use in load-bearing tissue engineering applications, such as cartilage. Fabrication of viable constructs using a novel multi-head deposition system provides the ability to combine synthetic polymers, which have higher mechanical strength than natural materials, with the favorable environment for cell growth provided by traditional naturally-derived hydrogels. However, the complexity and high cost associated with constructing the required robotic system hamper the widespread application of this approach. Moreover, the scaffolds fabricated by these robotic systems often lack flexibility, which further restrict their applications. To address these limitations, advanced fabrication techniques are necessary to generate complex constructs with controlled architectures and adequate mechanical properties. In this study, we describe the construction of a hybrid inkjet printing/electrospinning system that can be used to fabricate viable tissues for cartilage tissue engineering applications. Electrospinning of polycaprolactone fibers was alternated with inkjet printing of rabbit elastic chondrocytes suspended in a fibrin-collagen hydrogel in order to fabricate a five-layer tissue construct of 1\u00a0mm thickness. The chondrocytes survived within the printed hybrid construct with more than 80% viability one week after printing. In addition, the cells proliferated and maintained their basic biological properties within the printed layered constructs. Furthermore, the fabricated constructs formed cartilage-like tissues both in vitro and in vivo as evidenced by the deposition of type II collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Moreover, the printed hybrid scaffolds demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties compared to printed alginate or fibrin-collagen gels alone.

In the computer aided virtual planning was defined that, for the treatment, the patient needed to wear a series of 7 removable orthodontic appliances (ROA) over a duration of 21 weeks, with one appliance for every 3 weeks. A non-contact reverse engineering (RE) structured-light 3D scanner was used to create the 3D STL model of the impression of the patient's mouth. Numerical FEM simulations were performed varying the position of applied forces (discrete and continuous forces) on the same model, simulating, in this way, 3 models with slice thickness of 0.2 mm, 0.1 mm (RP staircase effect) and without slicing (ideal case). To define the areas of application of forces, two configuration \"i\" and \"i-1\" of the treatment were overlapped. 6 patients to which for three steps (3rd, 4th and 5th step) were made to wear aligners fabricated starting from physical models by 3D printing (3DP-ROA) and afterwards, for the next steps (6th, 7th and 8th step), aligners fabricated starting from physical models by CNC milling machine (CNC-ROA), were selected.\nFor the 6 patients wearing the CNC-ROA, it was observed a best fitting of the aligner to the teeth and a more rapid teeth movement than the 3DP-ROA (2 weeks compared to 3 weeks for every appliance). FEM simulations showed a more uniform stress distribution for CNC-ROA than 3DP-ROA.\nIn this research, 6 different case studies and CAD-FEM simulations showed that, to fabricate an efficient clear and removable orthodontic aligner, it is necessary to consider a compromise of several factors.

Radiographic examination revealed a large radiolucent area associated with an invaginated right maxillary central incisor, which was found to contain a vital pulp. The affected tooth was strategic in the dental arch. Conventional periapical radiographs provided only partial information about the invagination and its relationship with the main root canal and with the periapical tissues. A limited-volume CBCT scan of the maxilla did not show evidence of communication between the infected invagination and the pulp in the main root canal, which could explain the pulp vitality. A novel method was adopted to allow for instrumentation, disinfection and filling of the invagination, without compromising the vitality of the pulp in the complex root canal system. The CBCT data were used to produce precise 3D plastic models of the tooth. These models facilitated the treatment planning process and the trial of treatment approaches. This approach allowed the vitality of the pulp to be maintained in the complex root canal space of the main root canal whilst enabling the healing of the periapical tissues.\nEven when extensive periapical pathosis is associated with a tooth with type III dens invaginatus, pulp sensibility tests should be performed. CBCT is a diagnostic tool that may allow for the management of such teeth with complex anatomy. 3D printed plastic models may be a valuable aid in the process of assessing and planning effective treatment modalities and practicing them ex vivo before actually performing the clinical procedure.

{"title": "Fused deposition modeling provides solution for magnetic resonance imaging of solid dosage form by advancing design quickly from prototype to final product.", "abstract": "The release profile of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from its solid dosage form is an important aspect of drug development as it is often used to predict potential drug release characteristics of a product in vivo. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a nondestructive technique that captures the physical changes of solid dosage forms during dissolution. An example that highlights this application is in the dissolution of modified-release tablet studies. As the tablet dissolves, API disperses in a hydrogel matrix within the tablet, and swelling of the hydrogel layer eventually leads to release of API over time. To achieve optimum signal-to-noise ratios, the tablet should be placed in the most homogeneous region of the magnet and remain there throughout the dissolution experiment. Moreover, the tablet holder must maintain the tablet position without interfering with the natural dissolution process, such as by crushing the softened tablet. This can be difficult because the size, shape, and rigidity of the tablet change during dissolution. This article describes the process, material, and manufacture of a novel device that meets these challenges, with emphasis on how additive manufacturing on a 3D printer enabled an efficient and inexpensive process of design improvements.", "journal": "Journal of laboratory automation", "date": "2012-08-31", "authors": ["KenCharest", "Melody LMak-Jurkauskas", "DanielCinicola", "Andrew MClausen"], "doi": "10.1177/2211068212458264"}
{"title": "Microwave-sintered 3D printed tricalcium phosphate scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.", "abstract": "This study reports the manufacturing process of 3D interconnected macroporous tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds with controlled internal architecture by direct 3D printing (3DP), and high mechanical strength obtained by microwave sintering. TCP scaffolds with 27%, 35% and 41% designed macroporosity with pore sizes of 500\u2009\u03bcm, 750\u2009\u03bcm and 1000\u2009\u03bcm, respectively, were manufactured by direct 3DP. These scaffolds were then sintered at 1150\u2009\u00b0C and 1250\u2009\u00b0C in conventional electric muffle and microwave furnaces, respectively. Total open porosity between 42% and 63% was obtained in the sintered scaffolds due to the presence of intrinsic micropores along with designed pores. A significant increase in compressive strength between 46% and 69% was achieved by microwave compared to conventional sintering as a result of efficient densification. Maximum compressive strengths of 10.95\u2009\u00b1\u20091.28\u2009MPa and 6.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67\u2009MPa were achieved for scaffolds with 500\u2009\u03bcm designed pores (~ 400\u2009\u03bcm after sintering) sintered in microwave and conventional furnaces, respectively. An increase in cell density with a decrease in macropore size was observed during in vitro cell-material interactions using human osteoblast cells. Histomorphological analysis revealed that the presence of both micro- and macropores facilitated osteoid-like new bone formation when tested in femoral defects of Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results show that bioresorbable 3D-printed TCP scaffolds have great potential in tissue engineering applications for bone tissue repair and regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-03-08", "authors": ["SolaimanTarafder", "Vamsi KrishnaBalla", "Neal MDavies", "AmitBandyopadhyay", "SusmitaBose"], "doi": "10.1002/term.555\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.06.019\n10.1038/nmat1421\n10.1002/term.422\n10.1002/term.350"}
{"title": "The development of silk fibroin scaffolds using an indirect rapid prototyping approach: morphological analysis and cell growth monitoring by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.", "abstract": "To date, naturally derived biomaterials are rarely used in advanced tissue engineering (TE) methods despite their superior biocompatibility. This is because these native materials, which consist mainly of proteins and polysaccharides, do not possess the ability to withstand harsh processing conditions. Unlike synthetic polymers, natural materials degrade and decompose rapidly in the presence of chemical solvents and high temperature, respectively. Thus, the fabrication of tissue scaffolds using natural biomaterials is often carried out using conventional techniques, where the efficiency in mass transport of nutrients and removal of waste products within the construct is compromised. The present study identified silk fibroin (SF) protein as a suitable material for the application of rapid prototyping (RP) or additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Using the indirect RP method, via the use of a mould, SF tissue scaffolds with both macro- and micro-morphological features can be produced and qualitatively examined by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The advanced imaging technique showed the ability to differentiate the cells and SF material by producing high contrasting images, therefore suggesting the method as a feasible alternative to the histological analysis of cell growth within tissue scaffolds.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2011-11-08", "authors": ["M J JLiu", "S MChou", "C KChua", "B C MTay", "B KNg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2011.09.029"}

We describe a fully 3-dimensional (3D) digitally planned reconstruction of a mandible and immediate prosthetic loading with a fibula graft in a 2-step surgical approach.\nA 54-year-old man had development of osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. The resection, cutting and implant placement in the fibula were virtually planned. Cutting/drilling guides were 3D printed, and the suprastructure was computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing milled.\nFor the first operation, the implants were inserted in the fibula, and the position was registered by an optical scanning technique that defined the final planning of the suprastructure. For the second operation, the osteoradionecrosis was resected, the fibula was harvested and, with the denture fixed on the preinserted implants, placed in the mandibula guided by the occlusion.\nIt was possible to plan a mandibular reconstruction with immediate prosthetic loading completely by 3D virtual techniques.", "journal": "Head & neck", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["Rutger HSchepers", "Gerry MRaghoebar", "ArjanVissink", "Lars ULahoda", "W JoerdVan der Meer", "Jan LRoodenburg", "HarryReintsema", "Max JWitjes"], "doi": "10.1002/hed.21922"}
